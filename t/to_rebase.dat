40|$|The {{doctoral}} thesis attempts {{to build a}} legal regime {{for the right to}} culture, which is an individual right with an important collective dimension. The aim of the {{doctoral thesis}} is to enable the right to culture to exert all its effects. The fog that still veils the right to culture, despite its fundamental importance and its growing engagement in political discourse, has fuelled a desire, which is the source of my doctoral thesis, to clarify the sources, the content, the obligations and the legal guarantees of the right to culture. To conduct a rigorous definition of the legal right to culture, three majors themes were chosen : the arts, the cultural heritage and the lifelong education. The research has mainly been devoted to constitutional law and international human rights. However, legal evolutions and problems have been clarified and examined by using an interdisciplinary approach, including the disciplines of legal theory and political philosophy. The whole thesis is devoted to the demonstration that the right to culture is a legal, an effective and a legitimate reality. Two hypotheses underlie the doctoral thesis. The first central hypothesis is that the right to culture, if defined, can be considered as a fundamental right because it comprises the eight constitutive elements of every fundamental right (sources, object, democratic values as fundaments, prerogatives, obligations, debtors, titulars and justiciability). The right to culture it entails a full legal regime that implies precise obligations for the State, which are guaranteed by concrete mechanisms. The right to culture is related to a precise content: the diversity of cultural expression and cultural heritage. This right implies concrete prerogatives: the right to artistic freedom of expression; the right to conservation, development and diffusion of culture; the right to access to cultural life and to cultural information; the right to take part in cultural life; the right to freedom of choice in cultural matters; the right to participate in the elaboration on and the implementation of cultural policies. This right can be hold against its debtors. It deploys itself at different levels of effectivity and of justiciability. The second central hypothesis is that the construction of the legal regime of the right to culture and the legitimacy of this right depends on its capacity to manage a permanent balancing between three of its elements which appear to be antagonistic in nature: on the one hand, artistic freedom, and on the other, equality and participation in cultural life. Especially in the theoretical justification of cultural policies, in the mutual enrichment between the different sources of the right to culture, in the definition of the object of the right to culture and in the definition of the elements of this right, this balancing occurs. Two ideas are determining for the whole doctoral demonstration. The first one concerns the definition of the right to culture’s legal regime {{on the basis of a}} conception of « culture ». This conception is limited to the diversity of cultural expressions and heritages. This first stance is explored by means of five methodological steps. First, a philosophical exploration of the concept of culture has authorized to discover that this concept has to be understood mainly in reference to the work on meaning that culture build and embodies. Subsequently, the peculiar conditions under which the legal system can apprehend the concept of culture have been identified: the legal concept of culture has to be understood in reference to the embodiment and the materialization of the work on meaning constructed by the « culture » in the anthropological sense of the word. Afterwards, on the basis of a historical analysis of the right to culture’s interpretation, it was observed that, in international law, the interpretation that is sometimes constructed, i. e. what the right to culture concerns, has been taken outside the limits of the legal systems. Indeed, the right to culture, after being set free from a very limited and academic approach of culture by an opening to the diversity of cultural expressions wherever they come, has been constructed in connection with cultural identities. Next to this analysis, this conception of the right to culture was evaluated from a critical point of view, and eventually rejected,, because its fundaments are too weak and because it denatures the right to culture and poses a threat to its effectiveness. Cultural identity is a particular dimension of the right to culture but cannot be its main object. The right to culture is concerned with the protection and promotion of cultural identity even if protection and promotion of cultural identity is not the actual content of the right. Finally, a definition of the right to culture’s object has been developed in connection with the diversity of works, methods, spaces and practices which express, from a critical and creative point of view or as a heritage to transmit, the work on meanings operated by culture in the anthropological sense. This apprehension of the right to culture can disappoint those who see in this right a « magical » right, capable to touch culture in its complexity and to solve all the problems posed by the multiplicity of cultural identities and by the so called « Clash of Civilizations ». But this restriction in the definition of the right to culture’s object is in fact a necessary condition for deploying it in the legal world. Here we come to the second determining stance, which concerns the identification of the effectiveness and of the justiciability of the right to culture, de lege lata et de lege ferenda. Constructing this right in connection to the diversity of cultural expressions and heritages lets us identify the prerogatives that the right to culture implies and the obligations that can be recognized for its debtors. This definition of the right to culture has enabled us to define this right as a justiciable right, i. e. as a right that individuals can seize and that judges can use in their legal reasoning. The justiciability of the right to culture varies of course from one element to another. But, the important finding is that all elements of this right could be recognized as justiciable. For certain elements, as the right to artistic freedom, the right to culture benefits already from “direct effect” in a narrow sense. This is also the case for the right to access to cultural diversity without barriers. Other elements of the right to culture have been contextualized in the legal system in such a degree that they could benefit from direct effect sensu stricto. This contextualisation is visible in for e. g. the right to be protected from abuses of copyrights when using artistic freedom: this particular right is so detailed in Belgian law that a judge already asserted that it has a direct effect, without conflicting with the separation of powers doctrine. Moreover, de lege feranda, a whole range of elements of the right to culture could be recognized as entailing direct effect sensu stricto, quod non today. The other elements of the right to culture donot have “direct effect” and benefit only from a “direct effect” in a broad sense [...] For these elements, the standstill obligation is the determining factor because it indicates the compatibility control realized at the “contentieux objectif” by authorizing the judges to compare the litigious norm with the right to culture as it is materialized in Belgian law. Even if the right to culture is defined as it is suggested in the doctoral thesis, it remains a weak right and its effectiveness is far from being confirmed. This a-typical and ambivalent right can only be subjected to legal rationality when permanent conceptual efforts to apprehend this right in a legal way are made. However, the situation isn’t hopeless for all. Firstly, the right to culture opens great possibilities to defend, at the legal and philosophical levels, cultural policies and ways to rethink the conflict between economic law and cultural policies and laws. Furthermore, in a more positive way, the right to culture opens up new ways <b>to</b> <b>rebase</b> and re-legitimate the public law on culture and the cultural policies. These policies could indeed, thanks to the substantial and procedural elements of the right to culture’s legal regime, get a new lease after being out of steam for a long time. La thèse de doctorat s’attache à construire un régime juridique au droit à la culture, un droit individuel fondamental à dimension collective qui relève de la nébuleuse des droits culturels, dans le but notamment de permettre à celui-ci de déployer tous ses effets. Le brouillard qui entoure encore le droit à la culture, malgré son importance fondamentale et sa mobilisation grandissante dans le discours politique, a attisé une volonté, à l’origine de la thèse, d’en préciser les sources, l’objet, les obligations et les garanties juridictionnelles. Les recherches menées ont essentiellement été consacrées au droit constitutionnel et international des droits fondamentaux et ont été éclairées et interrogées grâce à une approche interdisciplinaire. Deux hypothèses générales sous-tendent la thèse. La première hypothèse est que le droit à la culture, à condition d’être défini, constitue un droit fondamental au sens juridique du terme et qu'il réunit les huit éléments constitutifs de la définition des droits fondamentaux. Ce droit est doté d’un régime juridique complet impliquant des obligations précises pour l’État, garanties par plusieurs mécanismes juridiques. Postulant l’existence d’un droit au maintien, au développement et à la promotion de la diversité de la culture et des patrimoines, le droit à la culture se définit comme le droit d’accéder et de participer à la vie culturelle, le droit au libre choix en matière culturelle, le droit à la liberté artistique et le droit de participer à l’élaboration et à la mise en œuvre des politiques culturelles. Ce droit, dont chaque individu est titulaire, peut être opposé à ses débiteurs et se déploie à des niveaux d’effectivité différents. La seconde hypothèse fondatrice de la thèse est que la précision du régime juridique du droit à la culture et la légitimité de ce droit dépendent de l’aptitude de ce dernier à opérer un travail constant de conciliation entre deux de ses éléments qui peuvent apparaître comme antagonistes : la liberté et l’égalité dans l’accès et la participation à la vie culturelle. La recherche d’un équilibre entre ces deux éléments intervient notamment au niveau de la justification théorique et de la mise en œuvre des politiques culturelles, dans l’enrichissement réciproque des différentes sources du droit à la culture, dans la définition de l’objet et des éléments du droit à la culture par rapport au concept de diversité culturelle. Deux idées maîtresses sont déterminantes pour l’ensemble de la démonstration doctorale. La première concerne la définition du régime juridique du droit à la culture par rapport à la diversité des expressions culturelles et des patrimoines, réalisée au fil de cinq étapes méthodologiquement distinctes. D’abord, une exploration philosophique du concept de culture a été entreprise pour découvrir que ce concept se comprend surtout par rapport au travail sur les significations qu’elle construit et qu’elle incarne. Ensuite, au plan philosophique, les conditions particulières dans lesquelles le droit peut appréhender le phénomène culturel ont été identifiées. Il se déduit des caractéristiques du système juridique que le concept de culture appréhendable par le droit des droits fondamentaux est celui qui se comprend en référence avec l’incarnation, l’objectivation et la concrétisation du travail sur les significations opéré par la culture au sens large dans des œuvres, des patrimoines et des pratiques culturelles. Dans une troisième étape, à partir d’une analyse historique de l’interprétation du droit à la culture, nous avons constaté qu’en droit international, l’interprétation qui est parfois donnée à l’objet du droit à la culture s’est portée au-delà des limites du système juridique que l’on avait identifiée. Alors que le droit à la culture s’est rapidement dégagé de l’interprétation restrictive qui le cantonnait à la « haute culture » pour s’ouvrir à la diversité des styles, des esthétiques et des contenus quelque soit leur origine, dans certains textes, force est de constater l’objet du droit à la culture est parfois étendu aux préoccupations liées à l’identité culturelle. Dans une quatrième étape, à l’aune d’une évaluation critique, cette interprétation du droit à la culture par rapport à l’identité culturelle a été interrogée et écartée, parce que ses fondements sont trop fragiles et contradictoires et parce qu’elle dénature le droit à la culture au point de le diluer et de menacer son effectivité. Ainsi, s’il est nécessaire que l’interprétation du droit à la culture intègre, en tant que dimension particulière et en tant qu’enjeux du droit à la culture, la protection et la promotion de l’identité culturelle, cette dernière ne peut être érigée en tant qu’objet du droit à la culture. Enfin, a été proposée une définition de l’objet du droit à la culture par rapport à la diversité des œuvres, des méthodes, des lieux et des pratiques qui expriment, de manière critique et créative, ou sous la forme d’un héritage à transmettre, le travail sur le sens opéré par la culture entendue au sens large du terme. Cette interprétation du droit à la culture peut décevoir ceux qui voyaient dans ce droit un droit plénier, totalisant, apte à saisir la culture dans sa globalité, à régler les problèmes posés par la multiplicité des identités culturelles ou par le soi-disant « choc des civilisations ». Mais c’est cette restriction dans la définition de l’objet du droit à la culture qui est en réalité la condition de possibilité de son déploiement dans la sphère juridique. Nous en arrivons ainsi à la deuxième idée maîtresse de la thèse, qui concerne l’identification, de lege lata et de lege ferenda, de l’effectivité et de la justiciabilité du droit à la culture. En « restreignant » l’objet du droit à la culture à la diversité culturelle et aux patrimoines, les attributs que ce droit implique pour les individus ont pu être identifiés ainsi que les obligations qui en découlaient pour leurs débiteurs. Cette définition des obligations qui découlaient du droit à la culture nous a permis, in fine, de définir le droit à la culture comme un droit justiciable, c'est-à-dire susceptible d’être invoqué par des particuliers et mobilisé par un juge dans son raisonnement juridique. Certes, la justiciabilité du droit à la culture varie selon les attributs de ce droit et reste virtuelle pour certains attributs, mais, moyennant certains ajustements, elle pourrait, dans tous les cas, facilement se développer. Pour certains attributs, le droit à la culture bénéficie de l’effet direct « au sens restreint », comme par exemple pour l’obligation de respecter la liberté artistique et ses spécificités ou le droit d’accéder sans entrave aux patrimoines et aux cultures. Par ailleurs, certains attributs du droit à la culture déploient une contextualisation qui leur permet, dans une certaine mesure, de bénéficier de l’effet direct « au sens restreint » : il s’agit par exemple de l’obligation de protéger la liberté artistique et la participation à la culture contre les excès du droit d’auteur. Cette obligation induite du droit à la culture est tellement précise, claire et déterminée par les textes belges qu’un juge a déjà, sans violer le principe de séparation des pouvoirs, reconnu qu’elles impliquent un tel droit. Par ailleurs, de lege feranda, une série d’attributs du droit à la culture qui pourraient se voir reconnaître un effet direct au sens restreint, quod non aujourd’hui, ont été identifiés. Les autres attributs du droit à la culture ne déploient qu’un effet direct « au sens large ». Pour ces attributs, l’obligation de standstill est déterminante car elle vient affiner le contrôle de compatibilité en autorisant le juge du contentieux objectif à comparer la norme litigieuse avec le droit à la culture tel qu’il a été concrétisé dans le droit positif, plus précisément avec le plus haut niveau de protection du droit à la culture. Même s’il est défini comme on l’a proposé dans la thèse, le droit à la culture reste un droit fragile, dont l’effectivité est loin d’être totalement assurée. Ce droit, atypique et ambivalent, ne peut en effet être soumis à la rationalité juridique qu’au prix d’efforts conceptuels permanents et d’incessants exercices d’équilibriste. Pour autant, le droit à la culture, tel que nous l’avons décrit, peut jouer, d’importantes fonctions. D’abord, le droit à la culture ouvre de belles possibilités pour défendre, au plan juridique, les politiques culturelles et pour repenser les conflits entre droit économique et droit des politiques culturelles. Ensuite, plus positivement, le droit à la culture ouvre des possibilités de refondation pour le droit public de la culture et, plus largement, pour les politiques culturelles. Ces dernières politiques pourraient ainsi retrouver, à partir du contenu substantiel et procédural du droit à la culture, le souffle qui tend, ces dernières années, à leur faire défaut.

This is a harmful effect that can produce non-solvable dimension chains at designing preproduction stage, and lead <b>to</b> <b>rebasing</b> in the course of assembly. Traditional means for mathematical description of mechanical structures, such as directed and undirected graphs, matrices, and etc., have no appropriate tools to identify redundancy and eliminate it. This can be achieved by using a relatively new mathematical model, i. e. a hyper-graph of mechanical linkages. It is shown that a necessary condition of redundancy is simple inequality X <R + 1, where X - the number of vertices, and R - the number of the hyper-graph edges. Eliminating the unnecessary mechanical linkages generates mechanical assembly structures with different assembly properties. The paper considers generation of non-redundant structures, which possess a maximum fractionalizing property. So-organized products can be broken up into the largest number of independently assembled fragments - assembly units. This simplifies the preproduction engineering and disassembly procedures in case of full or selective repairs during operation. It is shown that the normal sequence of assemblies enables us to reduce a mechanical structure of such products to the chain of a maximum length.   We propose an algorithm to eliminate redundancy. It generates the maximum fractionalizing mechanical structures. The algorithm is based on three heuristic rules that recommend eliminating edges, which disarrange a chain structure of the hyper-graph. The paper provides a rationale heuristics and considers a test case. To test the algorithm using a large array of examples, the experimental software has been developed. Computational experiments have been conducted using a sample of thirty redundant hyper-graphs randomly generated.

50|$|The LibreOffice project uses a dual LGPLv3 (or later) / MPL 2.0 {{license for}} new {{contributions}} {{to allow the}} license to be upgraded. Since {{the core of the}} OpenOffice.org codebase was donated to the Apache Software Foundation, there is an ongoing effort to get all the code <b>rebased</b> <b>to</b> ease future license updates. At the same time, there were complaints that IBM had not in fact released the Lotus Symphony code as open source, despite having claimed to. It was reported that some LibreOffice developers wanted to incorporate some code parts and bug fixes which IBM already fixed in their OpenOffice fork.|$|R
40|$|Ireland?s banking, {{property}} and fiscal crises, {{combined with a}} worldwide Great Recession have had severe implications for household incomes. Particular attention has focused on how incomes at various levels {{have been affected by}} tax and welfare policy responses to the overall crisis. This paper describes how SWITCH, the ESRI tax-benefit model, has been <b>rebased</b> <b>to</b> use data from SILC (Survey on Income and Living Conditions) 2010, capturing the major fall in household incomes and rise in unemployment. Selected analyses based on 2008 and 2010 data are reported, to give insights into the distributional and incentive impacts of tax and welfare policy up to 2012...|$|R
50|$|Frichs is a Danish {{company based}} in Horsens, founded in 1854 in Aarhus. Frichs today produce ship engines but started out in the 19th century {{producing}} a long range of farm and industry equipment, ships, church bells, cranes and later through the 20th century locomotives and train carriages. In the early to mid 20th century {{it was a major}} company and employer in Aarhus at its height employing some 1000 people. The company was the sole Danish supplier of locomotives for the Danish State Railways from 1919 to the mid 1950s and sold locomotives across Europe and to Siam and New Zealand. In 1980 the company was sold to Kosan and then restructured and <b>rebased</b> <b>to</b> Horsens.|$|R
50|$|No. 420 Squadron {{reformed}} at London, Ontario on 15 September 1948, {{and flew}} Mustang aircraft in a fighter role until the squadron disbanded on 1 September 1956. Re-formed during the unification period, No. 420 {{was an air}} reserve squadron based initially at CFB Shearwater, Nova scotia flying the Tracker air craft {{that had once been}} the backbone of the Canadian Naval Air's anti-submarine program. As an Air Reserve Squadron it participated with regular fisheries patrols. It {{was one of the few}} active Air Reserve Squadrons in Canada and was paired with the Regular Force's 880 Squadron. The Squadron was <b>rebased</b> <b>to</b> CFB Summerside when that base was downsized. No. 420 Squadron is no longer active.|$|R
500|$|After minor repairs, Sea Cloud was <b>rebased</b> <b>to</b> Argentia, Newfoundland, {{where she}} was {{assigned}} to Weather Station Number Three. While patrolling the area on June 11, 1944, the crew spotted a Navy Grumman TBF Avenger, exchanging recognition signals. Sea Cloud received orders {{to report to the}} escort carrier [...] and join the five other escort ships under her command. The envoy searched for a raft reported in the area, but returned with no sightings. After this event, Sea Cloud was once again reassigned to Weather Station Number Four. After a search for a downed aircraft, she returned to port in Boston. Sea Cloud was decommissioned on November 4, 1944, at the Bethlehem Steel Atlantic Yard and returned to Davies, along with $175,000 for conversion to pre-war appearance.|$|R
40|$|Summary: Simple, low-cost, and {{accurate}} genotyping methods for {{single nucleotide polymorphisms}} (SNPs) are in high demand in the post-genome-sequencing era. We present a graphical tool called SNPicker, implemented in Java, which significantly facilitates the design of mutagenic endonuclease restriction assays. SNPicker uses the online NEB <b>REBASE</b> <b>to</b> automatically scan for all possible designs of mutagenic primers that can facilitate the picking of mismatched PCR primers to artificially introduce or abolish a restriction site at the target SNP site. We successfully applied SNPicker in designing endonuclease restriction assays for 14 SNPs for the MTHFR gene, the Coagulation Factor II gene, and the Coagulation Factor V gene. The SNP assays designed using SNPicker were cross-validated using the MassARRAY technology. Availability: SNPicker, as a software tool in the Web-based SeqVISTA Suite, is freely available a...|$|R
50|$|Subsequently, 336 Squadron {{took part}} in the air {{operations}} of the Greek Civil War (1946-49). In February 1949 it was <b>rebased</b> <b>to</b> Larissa under the 110th Combat Wing. In August, the squadron was equipped with the US-made Curtiss SB2C Helldiver dive bombers, being redesignated as the 336th Light Bomber Squadron (336 Μοίρα Ελαφρού Βομβαρδισμού). In 1953 it was equipped with Republic F-84G Thunderjets and redesignated 336th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (336 Μοίρα Διώξεως-Βομβαρδισμού). On 28 December 1953, the squadron was transferred to 111th Combat Wing at Nea Anchialos, where it received the new Republic F-84F Thunderstreak in 1958. Redeployed again to Larissa in March 1959, it was transferred to 116th Combat Wing in December 1962. On 25 September 1963 it was redesignated as a Strike Squadron (Μοίρα Κρούσης) as a reflection of its new role.|$|R
5|$|The largest {{concentration}} of Southern Rhodesian {{troops in the}} Italian Campaign of 1943–45 was the group of about 1,400, mainly from the Southern Rhodesian Reconnaissance Regiment, spread across the South African 6th Armoured Division. The 11th South African Armoured Brigade, one of the 6th Division's two main components, {{was made up of}} Prince Alfred's Guard, the Pretoria Regiment (Princess Alice's Own) and the Special Service Battalion, each of which had a Rhodesian squadron of Sherman tanks. The other, the 12th South African Motorised Brigade, comprised infantry—the Witwatersrand Rifles, the Natal Carbineers and the Cape Town Highlanders, the last of which had a large Rhodesian contingent. There were also two Rhodesian artillery batteries—the original Rhodesian Anti-Tank Battery and a newer unit of Rhodesian field gunners. After a year's training in Egypt, the division sailed to Italy in April 1944, landing {{towards the end of the}} month at Taranto. No. 237 Squadron, now flying Spitfires, <b>rebased</b> <b>to</b> Corsica the same month to operate over Italy and southern France.|$|R
