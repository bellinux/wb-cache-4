5|$|<b>There</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> Arsenal {{supporters}} outside London, {{and since}} the advent of satellite television, a supporter's attachment to a football club has become less dependent on geography. Consequently, Arsenal have a significant number of fans from beyond London and all over the world; in 2007, 24 UK, 37 Irish and 49 other overseas supporters clubs were affiliated with the club. A 2011 report by SPORT+MARKT estimated Arsenal's global fanbase at 113 million. The club's social media activity was the fifth highest in world football during the 2014–15 season.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> differing {{opinions}} as to {{the divinity}} of God, the Son, and or his unity with God, the Father. Although historically the most significant debate in this arena was the Arianism and trinitarianism debate in the Roman Empire, debates in this realm have occurred throughout Christian history.|$|E

25|$|As the {{avifauna}} of the Mascarenes {{is predominantly}} of Indian origin though {{as old as}} to be highly distinct, {{it is not clear}} to which clade these starlings belong—or even if they are indeed starlings, as the Réunion starling at least was highly aberrant and <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> lingering doubts about whether they are correctly placed here.|$|E
25|$|Although {{generally}} held by most Brethren, both {{historical and}} contemporary, <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> some Brethren who rejected Dispensationalism. George Müller and G.H. Lang {{were among the}} prominent Brethren leaders who never accepted this doctrine, and non-Dispensationalism has always been followed by a significant minority of Open Brethren in the United Kingdom. Until much more recently, however, Dispensationalism was much more universally held among Brethren outside of the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|However, <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> {{scholars}} {{who believe that}} Shakespeare worked on the play alone. Many of {{the editors of the}} various twentieth century scholarly editions of the play for example, have argued against the co-authorship theory; Eugene M. Waith in his Oxford Shakespeare edition of 1985, Alan Hughes in his Cambridge Shakespeare edition of 1994 and again in 2006, and Jonathan Bate in his Arden Shakespeare edition of 1995. In the case of Bate however, in 2002, he came out in support of Brian Vickers' book Shakespeare, Co-Author which restates the case for Peele as the author of Act 1, 2.1 and 4.1.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked in}} a June 2010 {{interview}} with Movieline whether there would be film adaptation of the book, Carter said that plans were not serious at that point, and, [...] "Not really. Nothing serious. Let's put it this way: <b>There</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> people kicking it around because they think it's funny...Letterman made a...joke saying that Max von Sydow should play him. So, you know, people are just kicking it around like that." [...] Actor Bob Balaban, who portrayed NBC executive Warren Littlefield in The Late Shift {{said he would like}} to portray Jeff Zucker, and said Jason Alexander would also be a good choice to play Zucker. Andy Richter jokingly told Movieline that he would want Justin Bieber to portray him in a film adaptation of the book.|$|E

500|$|Blake {{comments}} that Disraeli [...] "produced an epic poem, unbelievably bad, and a five-act blank verse tragedy, if possible worse. Further {{he wrote a}} discourse on political theory and a political biography, the Life of Lord George Bentinck, which is excellent... remarkably fair and accurate." [...] But it is on his novels that Disraeli's literary achievements are generally judged. They have from the outset divided critical opinion. The writer R. W. Stewart observed that <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> two criteria for judging Disraeli's novels—one political and the other artistic. The critic Robert O'Kell, concurring, writes, [...] "It is after all, {{even if you are}} a Tory of the staunchest blue, impossible to make Disraeli into a first-rate novelist. And it is equally impossible, {{no matter how much you}} deplore the extravagances and improprieties of his works, to make him into an insignificant one." ...|$|E
500|$|As the Variety report suggests, recent {{technological}} advances greatly facilitate {{the production of}} truly low-budget motion pictures. Although <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> economical means with which to shoot movies, including Super 8 and 16mm film, as well as video cameras recording onto analog videotape, these mediums could not rival the image quality of 35mm film. The development of digital cameras and postproduction methods now allow even low-budget filmmakers to produce films with excellent, and not necessarily [...] "grittier", image quality and editing effects. As Marone observes, [...] "the equipment budget (camera, support) required for shooting digital is approximately 1/10 that for film, significantly lowering the production budget for independent features. At the same time, , the quality of digital filmmaking has improved dramatically." [...] Independent filmmakers, whether working in a genre or arthouse mode, continue to {{find it difficult to}} gain access to distribution channels, though digital end-to-end methods of distribution offer new opportunities. In a similar way, Internet sites such as YouTube have opened up entirely new avenues for the presentation of low-budget motion pictures.|$|E
500|$|Sir Adam Roberts, {{professor}} of international relations at the University of Oxford, was more critical in reviewing The Utility of Force for The Independent. Roberts believed that Smith over-stated the transformation into the new paradigm of war by playing down {{the extent to which}} <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> wars amongst the people, over-emphasised the role of technology in the shift from industrial warfare, and downplayed the continuation of industrial war. By way of example, Roberts points to the Iran–Iraq War and the role of precision bombing used by the United States in its campaigns {{since the end of the}} 20th century. In conclusion, Roberts states that [...] "it is possible to quibble over many details", but that [...] "such quibbles miss the essential point of the book: that involvement in today's crises, in the attempt to stop atrocities and bring wars to an end, requires a capacity for clear thought, a sensitivity to situation, and a talent for acting, that armed forces and their officers have not always possessed – and now badly need".|$|E

2500|$|The Nath Sampradaya is {{traditionally}} divided into twelve streams or Panths. According to David Gordon White, these panths {{were not really}} a subdivision of a monolithic order, but rather an amalgamation of separate groups descended from either Matsyendranath, Gorakshanath or one of their students. However, <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> many more Natha sects than will conveniently fit into the twelve formal panths.|$|E
