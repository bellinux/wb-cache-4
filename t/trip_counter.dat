40|$|There {{has been}} a {{dramatic}} increase in recent years in the number of battery-powered embedded electronic devices. However, the lifetime of these devices is limited by battery capacity. Energy harvesting is an efficient solution to overcome this limitation; however, large energy buffers have been traditionally employed to tackle the temporal variation of the source. These buffers typically require considerable time to charge while introducing a cost, size and weight overhead. Energy-driven systems are specifically designed to operate from an energy harvesting source, without overprovisioning energy storage to make the system appear "battery-like". Furthermore, a transiently-powered system is capable of sustaining computation despite an intermittent supply, without the need for additional energy storage. While this shows much promise, the wide applicability of these systems to real-life applications is yet to be demonstrated. This paper presents a transiently-powered wireless bicycle <b>trip</b> <b>counter</b> which measures distance, speed and active cycling time, and transmits data wirelessly. The system sustains operation by harvesting energy from the rotation of the wheel, operating from a minimum speed of 6 kph, while adapting its operation in response to the harvested energy...|$|E

5000|$|During {{production}} at Canley, the seat trim was again revised, with a plaid cloth in navy blue or tan, with matching coloured leather effect edging, and matching door cards. A further trim change during {{production at}} Solihull saw {{the use of}} a ruched velour in blue or tan on the seats, with matching inserts on the doors. Also, the internal door lock buttons were changed from the earlier standard BL round ones, to rectangular buttons held on with small grub screws. There was also a change to the <b>trip</b> mile <b>counter's</b> reset button, which became a push type operated through the instrument [...] "glass", rather than a turn type under the dash.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{patterns of}} usage {{and modes of}} access to traditional shopping districts. Environmentalists and designers have advocated a return to “traditional neighborhood development,” with higher densities, mixed uses, pedestrian amenities and transit service, to reduce auto dependence for shopping and other <b>trips.</b> Critics have <b>countered</b> that proximity only partly explains shopping destination and mode choice, but draw their evidence mostly from auto-dominated shopping centers, not traditional ones. Whether shopping districts predominantly serve local residents and support trip reduction has remained to be examined. This dissertation examines customer characteristics, patterns of use, and modes of access in six traditional shopping areas in the Oakland-Berkeley, California, area. The six districts are surrounded by middle class, moderately dense residential neighborhoods with transit service and pedestrian access consonant with neo-traditional design. They vary in scale and mix of uses across the range proposed by neo-traditional designers. Surveys, counts, and observations reveal that all six shopping areas draw a mix of residents and non-residents. The non-residents’ share increases with {{the scale of the}} shopping area and the share of comparison shopping. Distance is {{the most important factor in}} the mode choice to these shopping areas; most non-residents drive, whereas only half the residents do. Younger customers and those with few or no autos walk more than average. Those shopping for groceries or making multiple stops for specialty food typically drive. Non-resident shoppers are more likely to purchase comparison goods than residents. Both groups are attracted by specialty foods. Trip generation rates in the six shopping areas are higher than conventional methods predict, but auto shares are much lower. The result is parking demand close to conventional estimates. The dissertation reveals conflicts among the needs of residents, the needs of shopping districts, and traffic mitigation objectives. Many uses that serve residents and add interest and vitality to traditional shopping areas also attract a high share of non-residents, mostly by car. Trip generation can be very high, even though the auto share is relatively low. If other neo-traditional shopping districts follow suit, their benefits will stem more convenience than from trip reduction per se...|$|R
5000|$|Judith Niemi {{explained}} part of Woodswomen's {{philosophy as}} [...] "Not worrying about competition, achievement, ego. Especially not thinking we are conquering nature." [...] Many people {{go into the}} wilderness with the mindset of [...] "conquering the great outdoors." [...] Woodswomen <b>trips</b> worked to <b>counter</b> that mindset and instead learn through nature, getting to feel comfortable, and ending up feeling blissful, in the outdoors. In addition, Woodswomen staff worked to be process oriented. The idea {{was that it was}} not important how far you went, how fast you climbed, etc., but rather what you saw, what you experienced, what you did. For guides, a great deal of emphasis was placed on leadership styles, and guides completed extensive guide trainings. Woodswomen directors would look for [...] "alternatives to hierarchical leadership and centralized authority," [...] working to have everyone participate in decision-making. Woodswomen directors maintained that learning outdoor skills from other women is better for women than learning them from men. Especially {{in the early years of}} Woodswomen (1970s and '80s), many women did not have strong outdoors skills because they had not been given the opportunity to learn them. This would lead to women on outdoor trips being marginalized for their lack of skill and not getting the opportunity to learn. When men on trips would teach women some skills, it would be condescending and hierarchal, and women would get frustrated when they didn't get it right away. When women learn from women, there's not as much of the condescension, and women are able to take more control of their learning—"When women learn from women, they take more credit for learning," [...] said Elizabeth Barnard in an interview. Traveling with other women also gets women out of passive roles they may take at home and on trips with men, where they are marginalized in favor of having the supposedly stronger and faster men do the job. When men are not around, it's impossible for women to fall into gender roles in terms of the tasks they perform and the skills they must learn. In addition to learning new skills and becoming comfortable in the outdoors, one of the main byproducts of Woodswomen trips was increased self-esteem in participants. Women coming back from Woodswomen trips reported an increase in confidence, saying things like [...] "now I know I can go for that job promotion." [...] Woodswomen affiliates did research over the years about outcomes of trips, and learned about how empowered women felt after trips.|$|R
