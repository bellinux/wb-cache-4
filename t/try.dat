5|$|Bill Mullins, {{father of}} 2002 premiership player Brett, scored 104 tries in his 11-year, 190-game career with Eastern Suburbs between 1968 and 1978, meaning that on average, he scored {{at least one}} <b>try</b> every two games. Anthony Minichiello became the highest <b>try</b> scorer in the Roosters history when he scored his 105th <b>try</b> against the Newcastle at Ausgrid Stadium in June 2011. 'Mini' finally retired after the 2014 season, and ended his career with 139 tries. He is also the first fullback in 70 years to win the Grand Final (2013), whilst captaining the Club.

40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} {{the use of}} <b>tries</b> to {{represent}} <b>tries.</b> A morphic trie image is a trie that represents a set of transformed keywords using an isomorphism h: Σ* → (σ q) *. Morphic trie images using tenary alphabets achieve near optimal performances but approximation errors degrade their performances. A condition which determines whether tenary or bit <b>tries</b> should be used is found. Even though bit <b>tries</b> have better storage reduction in some cases, tenary <b>tries</b> access faster than bit <b>tries.</b> We show that the morphic trie images use less space than minimal prefix <b>tries.</b> If morphic trie images were compressed to form minimal prefix <b>tries,</b> then the total storage reduction {{is the product of}} the two. Approximation errors have no effect on minimal prefix <b>tries.</b> Department of Computin...|$|R

In the opening period, the sides were evenly matched but {{eventually}} the British scored a <b>try</b> in the corner, which was converted, and a second <b>try</b> soon after took them eight points clear. The visitors were up 13–0 at half time after another converted try: the home side had made numerous attacking attempts but had failed to cross the line. The second half started as the first had ended, with NSW dominating, but they failed to score; instead, the British managed to counter-attack to score another converted <b>try.</b> NSW then managed to score a <b>try</b> but Verge failed to convert. The tourists then scored another three tries, one of them converted. With Britain leading 3–29 in the closing minutes, NSW scored a second try; this time Wickham missed the conversion. The final score was 6–29.|$|E

5|$|Geen got {{his second}} <b>try</b> after another break from Poulton. Cambridge {{meanwhile}} scored two tries and at half-time were leading 15–13. Fifteen {{minutes into the}} second half, a second <b>try</b> for Cambridge put them five points ahead. An injury to one of Cambridge's scoring wings reduced the team to fourteen players; a forward moved to cover the wing, giving Oxford an advantage in the forwards. Poulton capitalised on it: he scored from a dummy pass to Geen; and ran in a solo <b>try</b> after receiving a pass from flyhalf Freddie Knott. The end score was 23–18 to Oxford.|$|E
5|$|Geen was {{selected}} to play for Oxford against Cambridge in four consecutive years from 1910 to 1913. In the first of these, on 13 December 1910, a 9,000-strong crowd turned up at Queen's, mostly to watch Ronnie Poulton, playing for Oxford. Cambridge started strong but a <b>try</b> by Bryn Lewis was disallowed in the opening minutes after a touch judge signalled that Geen had put his foot into touch in the preceding Oxford move. Moments later, Poulton ran through the Cambridge defence, drew the fullback and passed to Geen to dive in at the corner for a <b>try.</b> With Turner's conversion, Oxford led 5–0. A similar passage of play again saw Poulton put Geen through for a <b>try,</b> but he dropped the ball after crossing the line while trying {{to get closer to}} the posts.|$|E
