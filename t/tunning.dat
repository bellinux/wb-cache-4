As women were forced out of brewing, {{the creation of a new}} ideology about women brewers took place which included [...] "the construction of women as incapable of brewing; the link of this construction to the witch; and the position of widows as both brewers and ale-sellers". Popular depictions of alewives described them as witch-like, untrustworthy, corrupt and grotesque. In Ballad on an Ale-Seller, John Lydgate describes an alewife [...] "who uses her charms to induce men to drink". The alewife in the popular poem, The <b>Tunning</b> of Elynour Rummyng, by John Skelton, is [...] "strikingly viscous and nasty". Other depictions of alewives in England showed them [...] "condemned to eternal punishment in hell".

50|$|The <b>Tunning</b> of Elynour Rummyng {{is a long}} raucous poem {{written by}} English poet John Skelton. The poem was printed by Richard Lant {{sometime}} in 1550 and presents what many would consider disgusting images of rural drinking and drunkenness. For all its gritty description, Skelton has modeled the poem on Church liturgy of that time. The verse form itself closely resembles a liturgical chant.|$|E
50|$|In {{popular culture}} of the period as well, the alewife was a common figure of comical condemnation. She was {{depicted}} in Dooms or church murals as someone who belonged in hell. Poems such as John Skelton's The <b>Tunning</b> of Elynour Rummyng, The Tale of Beryn and Mother Bunch of Pasquil's Jests all depicted as repulsive figures. Either sexually promiscuous themselves, or employers of prostitutes, the alewife was frequently associated with sinful behavior. Eynour Rummyng produces a parody of a mass while luring men away from church. The character of Kit in The Tale of Beryn seduces one man while flirting with another all {{for the purpose of}} selling ale. Mother Bunch's famous ale is said to be made from her nose. Whether laughed at with the alewives or against them, the language of these poems suggest that they were intended for a general public rather than exclusively the courts, making the popularity of the flawed alewife a common role of society.|$|E

40|$|A 162. 5 MHz, 2. 1 MeV Radio Frequency Quadruples (RFQ) {{structure}} is being {{designed for the}} Injector Scheme II of China Accelerator Driver System (CADS) driver linac. The RFQ will operate at continuous wave (CW) mode as required. For the CW normal conducting machine, the heat management {{will be one of}} the most important issues, since the temperature fluctuation may cause cavity deformation and leading to the resonant frequency shift. Therefor a detailed multi-physics analysis is necessary to ensure that the cavity can be stably worked at the required power level. The multi-physics analysis process includes RF Electromagnetic analysis, Thermal analysis, Mechnical analysis, and this process will be iterated for several cycles until the satisfied solution can be found. As one of the widely accepted measures, the cooling water system is used for frequency fine <b>tunning,</b> so the <b>tunning</b> capability of the cooling water system is also studied at different conditions.

METHODS: Five laryngectomees wearing tracheoesophageal voice prosthesis completed the singing training program over a period of three months, with exploration of the strengthening of the respiratory muscles and vocalization and with evaluation of perceptive-auditory and singing voice being performed before and after 12 sessions of singing therapy. RESULTS: After the program of singing voice training, the quality of tracheoesophageal voice showed improvement or the persistence of the general degree of dysphonia for the emitted vowels and for the parameters of roughness and breathiness. For the vowel "a", the pitch was displaced to grave in two participants and to acute in one, and remained adequate in the others. A similar situation was observed also for the vowel "i". After the singing program, all participants presented <b>tunning</b> and most of them showed a greater presence of legato. The vocal extension improved in all participants.

40|$|The {{method of}} Lamb waves to detect defects in {{aerospace}} structures is already known in research environments for its benefits, using an inexpensive equipment. The major benefits are: accurate determination of location {{and size of}} the defects in material {{and the fact that it}} is a non destructive method. For experiments are used aluminum plates that are willing piezoelectric exciters as follows: a piezoelectric actuator placed on a point on the plate will excite that point and the signal will be received by a piezoelectric receiver placed on another point from the plate. By interpreting the shape, phase and amplitude of the received signal we can determine the shape and location of the defect. The excitation signal frequency should be previously known by determining the amplitude in a frequency band set between 10 - 800 kHz, for the plate without defects, which is called the tuning procedure. Due to the fact that the structures will work also on flight condition temperature as on high altitude or in space, it is neccesary to check how these extremelly low temperatures influence the defect detection. For this purpose the first step is to determine how the temperature variation affects the <b>tunning</b> results.
