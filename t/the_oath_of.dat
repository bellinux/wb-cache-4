5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Oath</b> <b>of</b> the Vayuputras is a 2013 {{novel by}} Indian author Amish Tripathi {{and the final}} book in his Shiva trilogy. The book was {{released}} on 27 February 2013, through Westland Press and completes the mythical story about an imaginary land Meluha and how its inhabitants were saved by a nomad named Shiva. Starting from where the previous installment left off, Shiva discovers that Somras is the true evil in <b>The</b> <b>Oath</b> <b>of</b> the Vayuputras. Shiva then declares a holy war on {{those who seek to}} continue to use it, mainly the Emperors Daksha and Dilipa, who are being controlled by the sage Bhrigu. The battle rages on and Shiva travels to the land of Pariha to consult with Vayuputras, a legendary tribe. By the time he returns, the war has ended with Sati, his wife, being murdered. An enraged Shiva destroys the capital of Meluha and Somras is wiped out of history. The story concludes with Shiva and his associates being popularized as Gods for their deeds and accomplishments.|$|E

Burnett asked that the question be divided. His request was granted, but he only found one colleague willing to vote with him against blaming Southerners for the war.|$|E

5|$|George Calvert {{went up to}} Trinity College at Oxford University, matriculating in 1593/94, {{where he}} studied foreign {{languages}} and received a bachelor's degree in 1597.

The same pattern of conformity, whether pretended or sincere, continued through Calvert's early life. After Oxford, he moved in 1598 to London, where he studied municipal law at Lincoln's Inn for three years.|$|E

5|$|In 1847 a small {{political}} crisis occurred which removed Bentinck from {{the leadership and}} highlighted Disraeli's differences with his own party. In that year's general election, Lionel de Rothschild had been returned for the City of London. As a practising Jew he could not take <b>the</b> <b>oath</b> <b>of</b> allegiance in the prescribed Christian form, and therefore could not take his seat. Lord John Russell, the Whig leader who had succeeded Peel as Prime Minister and like Rothschild was a member for the City of London, proposed in the Commons that the oath should be amended to permit Jews to enter Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Knott was disbarred {{and briefly}} imprisoned for {{his refusal to}} take <b>the</b> <b>oath</b> <b>of</b> allegiance. He {{returned}} to Kentucky in 1863 and {{was elected to the}} U.S. House of Representatives. In 1871, he made a notable speech ridiculing a bill to subsidize westward expansion of railroads. In the speech, he lampooned the remote town of Duluth, Minnesota. The Duluth speech was eventually reprinted in several publications and brought Knott national acclaim. He did not stand for re-election in 1870, instead making a failed run for the office of governor. In 1875, he returned to the House and served as chair of the judiciary committee.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Oaths</b> <b>of</b> Allegiance and Supremacy Act 1688 (1 Will. & Mar., c. 8) was an Act of the Parliament of England {{passed in}} the {{aftermath}} of the Glorious Revolution. The Act required all office-holders, Members of Parliament and clergy to take <b>the</b> <b>oaths</b> <b>of</b> allegiance and supremacy for the new monarchs, William III and Mary II. The Archbishop of Canterbury, William Sancroft, five bishops and approximately four hundred lower clergy refused to take <b>the</b> <b>oaths</b> because they believed their oaths to James II were still valid. The Act thus triggered the nonjuring schism in the Church of England. The non-jurors were deprived of their offices.|$|R
