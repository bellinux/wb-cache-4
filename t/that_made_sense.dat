500|$|Breaking Benjamin's lyrical content {{evolved as}} a product of Burnley's sobriety, the front man noting that the lyricism in Dear Agony is more thought out. Rito Asilo of the Inquirer writes that Burnley [...] "owes the {{improved}} clarity and coherence in Breaking Benjamin's music to sobriety." [...] Burnley has said that before sobriety, anything <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> thematically was a coincidence, and that he would take shots if he were dissatisfied with a lyric. Breaking Benjamin's lyrics have been noted for their vague, angst-heavy themes, Burnley saying that [...] "I try to keep my writing vague so people can draw their own conclusions." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Roderick Spencer and Selwyn Tillett {{discovered}} the ballet from Act II of Thespis. Two {{of the five}} movements, in the same hand that had copied the score of [...] "Climbing over rocky mountain", were found together with the surviving performance materials for Sullivan's 1864 ballet, L'Île Enchantée. Another section {{was found in the}} material for his 1897 ballet, Victoria and Merrie England. The page numbering of the surviving three sections gave approximate lengths for the missing pieces, and a contemporary engraving, seen at left, along with other circumstantial evidence, allowed plausible identifications of the two remaining movements: a dragon costume, used nowhere in the libretto, is presumably from the ballet, and the harp visible in the orchestra pit was an unusual instrument for the Gaiety's orchestra. Movements of appropriate length <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> of these oddities were found in Sullivan's other ballets, and the reconstructed ballet has been recorded twice on CD.|$|E

500|$|Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe {{gave the}} film a two and {{half out of}} four stars saying, [...] "Who knew that the franchise's creators would {{eventually}} find a plot twist <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense?</b> Who knew they'd realize that Tobin Bell's righteous killer had current-events value? Given our cable-news climate, it's not beyond imagining that John Kramer could have his own populist TV show: 'Jigsaw's Death Panel'?". [...] Blake French of AMC Filmcritic gave the film {{three and a half}} out of five, writing, [...] "Director Kevin Greutert hasn't helmed a lot of films in the past, but he did edit all of the previous Saws. As it turns out, his mastered craft lends well to directing. He spins a taut, tight, concise web of terror and surprise. The best entry in the series since Saw II." [...] Brad Miska of Bloody Disgusting gave the film seven out of ten and wrote [...] "Saw VI is faithful to the franchise and the twist/finale are 100% satisfying. Saw fans will walk out of the theater with their fists in the air with the feeling that they've reclaimed their beloved franchise." [...] Marc Savlov of Austin Chronicle gave the film one and half out of five stars, saying [...] "Enshrouding the whole gooey mess in the already blood-spattered surgical garb of the ongoing health care debate is a crafty move on the screenwriters' part, but once you get past that pseudo-ironic touch, this Saw is no more or less disturbing than any other in the series".|$|E
2500|$|The first {{versions}} of balanced scorecard asserted that relevance should {{derive from the}} corporate strategy, and proposed design methods that focused on choosing measures and targets associated with the main activities required to implement the strategy. [...] As the initial audience for this were the readers of the Harvard Business Review, the proposal was translated into a form <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> to a typical reader of that journal – managers of US commercial businesses. [...] Accordingly, initial designs were encouraged to measure three categories of non-financial measure in addition to financial outputs – those of [...] "customer," [...] "internal business processes" [...] and [...] "learning and growth." [...] These categories were not so relevant to public sector or non-profit organisations, or units within complex organizations (which might have high degrees of internal specialization), {{and much of the}} early literature on balanced scorecard focused on suggestions of alternative 'perspectives' that might have more relevance to these groups(e.g. Butler et al. (1997), Ahn (2001), Elefalke (2001), Brignall (2002), Irwin (2002), Radnor et al. (2003)).|$|E
2500|$|There is some {{evidence}} that humans can determine the suspected emotions of dogs while listening to barks emitted during specific situations. Humans scored the emotions of dogs performing these barks very similarly and in ways <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> according to the situation at hand. In one example, when subjects were played a recording of a dog tied alone to a tree, a situation in which one could reasonably infer that the dog would be distressed, the human listeners tended to rank the bark as having a high level of despair. It has been suggested that this may be evidence for the idea that dog barks have evolved to be a form of communication with humans specifically, since humans can so readily determine a dog's needs by simply listening to their vocalizations. Further studies have found that the acoustic structure of a bark [...] " [...] considerably with context." [...] These studies suggest that barks are more than just random sounds, and indeed hold some sort of communicative purpose.|$|E

2500|$|Following Davis to {{his newly}} formed J Records label, Keys rented an {{apartment}} {{and struggled to}} create an album. She began writing the song [...] "Troubles" [...] {{and came to a}} realization: [...] "That's when the album started comin' together. Finally, I knew how to structure my feelings into something <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense,</b> something that can translate to people. That was a changing point. My confidence was up, way up." [...] Keys learned how to produce by asking questions to the producers and engineers; she wrote, arranged and produced a majority of the album. She recorded the songs [...] "Rock wit U" [...] and [...] "Rear View Mirror", which were featured on the soundtracks to the films Shaft (2000) and Dr. Dolittle 2 (2001), respectively. One of the final songs Keys recorded was [...] "Fallin'". A total of 32 songs were recorded for the album. Originally titled Soul Stories in A Minor, the title of the album was changed over concerns that it would limit exposure only to black radio stations.|$|E
2500|$|In firing Willingham, the Notre Dame {{athletic}} department cited a relatively poor record of 21–15, a weak recruiting class, and three losses, each by 31points, to rival USC. However, the Irish also hoped to entice Urban Meyer, {{the head coach}} of the Utah Utes, to lead Notre Dame. Meyer had just led the Utes to an undefeated season and he had a clause in his contract that stated he could leave Utah without a penalty to coach for the Irish. When Meyer instead took the head coaching position at Florida, the Irish were ridiculed in the media with claims that the Notre Dame coaching position was no longer as prestigious {{as it was in the}} past. After over a week without a coach, the Irish hired New England Patriots' offensive coordinator Charlie Weis as head coach. Weis was an alumnus of Notre Dame, and he became the first alumnus to coach the team since 1963. At least one sports writer stated that Weis [...] was a choice <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> for the program. Willingham, meanwhile, accepted a position as {{head coach of the}} University of Washington Huskies football team.|$|E

[...] So, {{in order to create a}} believable pair of magic systems, I researched what amounted to Newtonian versus Quantum mechanics and, later, competing visions of quantum theory. I read popular science books regarding Relativity, quantum mechanics, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, parallel universes and chaos theory.
