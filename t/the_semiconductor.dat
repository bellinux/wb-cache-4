5|$|Indium {{has many}} semiconductor-related applications. Some indium compounds, such as indium {{antimonide}} and indium phosphide, are semiconductors with useful properties: one precursor is usually trimethylindium (TMI), {{which is also}} used as <b>the</b> <b>semiconductor</b> dopant in II–VI compound semiconductors. InAs and InSb are used for low-temperature transistors and InP for high-temperature transistors. The compound semiconductors InGaN and InGaP are used in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes. Indium is used in photovoltaics as <b>the</b> <b>semiconductor</b> copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), also called CIGS solar cells, a type of second-generation thin-film solar cell. Indium is used in PNP bipolar junction transistors with germanium: when soldered at low temperature, indium does not stress the germanium.|$|E
5|$|ZnO is {{a wide-bandgap}} {{semiconductor}} of the II-VI semiconductor group. The native doping of <b>the</b> <b>semiconductor</b> due to oxygen vacancies or zinc interstitials is n-type. This semiconductor has several favorable properties, including good transparency, high electron mobility, wide bandgap, and strong room-temperature luminescence. Those properties are valuable in emerging applications for: transparent electrodes in liquid crystal displays, energy-saving or heat-protecting windows, and electronics as thin-film transistors and light-emitting diodes.|$|E
5|$|Extremely high-purity (99.9999+%) gallium is commercially {{available}} to serve <b>the</b> <b>semiconductor</b> industry. Gallium arsenide (GaAs) and gallium nitride (GaN) used in electronic components represented about 98% of the gallium {{consumption in the}} United States in 2007. About 66% of semiconductor gallium {{is used in the}} U.S. in integrated circuits (mostly gallium arsenide), such as the manufacture of ultra-high speed logic chips and MESFETs for low-noise microwave preamplifiers in cell phones. About 20% of this gallium is used in optoelectronics. Worldwide, gallium arsenide makes up 95% of the annual global gallium consumption.|$|E

50|$|Initially, all {{switches}} {{are closed}} (on). Because <b>the</b> high-voltage <b>semiconductor</b> switch has much greater resistance than the mechanical switch plus <b>the</b> low-voltage <b>semiconductor</b> switch, current flow through it is low. To disconnect, first <b>the</b> low-voltage <b>semiconductor</b> switch opens. This diverts the current through <b>the</b> high-voltage <b>semiconductor</b> switch. Because of its relatively high resistance, it begins heating very rapidly. Then the high-speed mechanical switch is opened. Unlike <b>the</b> low-voltage <b>semiconductor</b> switch, which {{is capable of}} standing off only the voltage drop of <b>the</b> closed high-voltage <b>semiconductor</b> switch, this one is capable of standing off the full voltage. Because no current is flowing through this switch when it opens, it is not damaged by arcing. Then, <b>the</b> high-voltage <b>semiconductor</b> switch is opened. This actually cuts the power. However, it is not quite 100% off. A final low-speed mechanical switch disconnects the residual current.|$|R

5|$|Indium {{is a minor}} {{component}} in zinc sulfide ores and is produced as a byproduct of zinc refinement. It is most notably used in <b>the</b> <b>semiconductor</b> industry, in low-melting-point metal alloys such as solders, in soft-metal high-vacuum seals, and {{in the production of}} transparent conductive coatings of indium tin oxide (ITO) on glass. Indium has no biological role, though its compounds are somewhat toxic when injected into the bloodstream. Most occupational exposure is through ingestion, from which indium compounds are not absorbed well, and inhalation, from which they are moderately absorbed.|$|E
5|$|Roughly {{one quarter}} of all zinc output in the United States in 2009 was {{consumed}} in zinc compounds; a variety of which are used industrially. Zinc oxide is widely used as a white pigment in paints and as a catalyst {{in the manufacture of}} rubber to disburse heat. Zinc oxide is used to protect rubber polymers and plastics from ultraviolet radiation (UV). <b>The</b> <b>semiconductor</b> properties of zinc oxide make it useful in varistors and photocopying products. The zinc zinc-oxide cycle is a two step thermochemical process based on zinc and zinc oxide for hydrogen production.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{routes to}} elemental boron involved {{the reduction of}} boric oxide with metals such as magnesium or aluminium. However, the product is almost always contaminated with borides of those metals. Pure boron can be prepared by reducing volatile boron halides with hydrogen at high temperatures. Ultrapure boron for use in <b>the</b> <b>semiconductor</b> industry is produced by the decomposition of diborane at high temperatures and then further purified with the zone melting or Czochralski processes.|$|E

The non-linear behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>semiconductors</b> is modelled by the drift diffusion equations. Coupling relations are defined and a sensitivity analysis concept that generalises the DAE index for finite systems to infinite ones is presented and applied to the resulting partial differential algebraic equation (PDAE).

5|$|Thermotropic chiral LCs whose pitch varies {{strongly}} with temperature {{can be used}} as crude liquid crystal thermometers, since the color of the material will change as the pitch is changed. Liquid crystal color transitions are used on many aquarium and pool thermometers as well as on thermometers for infants or baths. Other liquid crystal materials change color when stretched or stressed. Thus, liquid crystal sheets are often used in industry to look for hot spots, map heat flow, measure stress distribution patterns, and so on. Liquid crystal in fluid form is used to detect electrically generated hot spots for failure analysis in <b>the</b> <b>semiconductor</b> industry.|$|E
5|$|Another Avogadro constant-based approach, {{known as}} the International Avogadro Coordination's Avogadro project, would define and {{delineate}} the kilogram as a 93.6mm diameter sphere of silicon atoms. Silicon was chosen because a commercial infrastructure with mature processes for creating defect-free, ultra-pure monocrystalline silicon already exists to service <b>the</b> <b>semiconductor</b> industry. To make a practical realization of the kilogram, a silicon boule (a rod-like, single-crystal ingot) would be produced. Its isotopic composition would be measured with a mass spectrometer to determine its average relative atomic mass. The boule would be cut, ground, and polished into spheres. The size of a select sphere would be measured using optical interferometry to an uncertainty of about 0.3nm on the radius—roughly a single atomic layer. The precise lattice spacing between the atoms in its crystal structure (≈192pm) would be measured using a scanning X-ray interferometer. This permits its atomic spacing to be determined with an uncertainty of only three parts per billion. With {{the size of the}} sphere, its average atomic mass, and its atomic spacing known, the required sphere diameter can be calculated with sufficient precision and low uncertainty to enable it to be finish-polished to a target mass of one kilogram.|$|E
5|$|In many applications, {{the noble}} gases {{are used to}} provide an inert atmosphere. Argon {{is used in the}} {{synthesis}} of air-sensitive compounds that are sensitive to nitrogen. Solid argon is also used for the study of very unstable compounds, such as reactive intermediates, by trapping them in an inert matrix at very low temperatures. Helium is used as the carrier medium in gas chromatography, as a filler gas for thermometers, and in devices for measuring radiation, such as the Geiger counter and the bubble chamber. Helium and argon are both commonly used to shield welding arcs and the surrounding base metal from the atmosphere during welding and cutting, as well as in other metallurgical processes and in the production of silicon for <b>the</b> <b>semiconductor</b> industry.|$|E

30|$|In {{the case}} of <b>the</b> {{elementary}} <b>semiconductors,</b> at <b>the</b> first stage of the process, a thin top layer with mechanical compressive stress due to separation and redistribution of interstitials and vacancies in gradient temperature field [14] on the irradiated surface of <b>the</b> <b>semiconductors</b> is formed.

Vacancies are concentrated under the top layer forming a buried layer with mechanical tension due {{to the absence of}} atoms. Sometimes vacancies form nanocavities [17]. At the second stage of the process, nanocones are formed on the irradiated surface of <b>the</b> <b>semiconductors</b> due to plastic deformation of the top layer {{in the same way as}} in the previous case with semiconductor solid solutions.|$|R
