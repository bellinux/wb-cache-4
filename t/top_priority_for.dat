5|$|In October 2014, a Man of Steel sequel was {{announced}} with an intended release between 2016 and 2020. In August 2015, Jon Schnepp revealed to DC Movie News on the Popcorn Network that the studio are {{rumored to have}} George Miller as the director for the sequel. In June 2016, Russel Crowe confirmed that a Man of Steel trilogy was originally planned before it was scrapped due to the announcement of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice In August 2016, The Wrap reports that the studio has announced that the sequel is now in development as a <b>top</b> <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> the studio and getting the character right for audiences is of tantamount importance. The news of a standalone Superman film were later confirmed by Dany Garcia, Henry Cavill's manager. While promoting Arrival, Amy Adams confirmed work has begun on the screenplay.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the revolt, Treblinka II {{continued}} to function and remained a <b>top</b> <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> the SS for another year. Stangl met the head of Operation Reinhard, Odilo Globocnik, and inspector Christian Wirth in Lublin, and decided not to draft a report, as no native Germans had died putting down the revolt. Stangl wanted to rebuild the camp, but Globocnik told him it would be closed down shortly and Stangl would be transferred to Trieste to help fight the partisans there. The Nazi high command may have felt that Stangl, Globocnik, Wirth, and other Reinhard personnel knew too much and wanted to dispose of them by sending them to the front. With almost all the Jews from the German ghettos (established in Poland) killed, {{there would have been}} little point in rebuilding the facility. Auschwitz had enough capacity to fulfil the Nazis' remaining extermination needs, rendering Treblinka redundant.|$|E
5|$|Plants face severe {{challenges}} in arid environments. Problems {{they need to}} solve include how to obtain enough water, how to avoid being eaten and how to reproduce. Photosynthesis {{is the key to}} plant growth. It can only take place during the day as energy from the sun is required, but during the day, many deserts become very hot. Opening stomata to allow in the carbon dioxide necessary for the process causes evapotranspiration, and conservation of water is a <b>top</b> <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> desert vegetation. Some plants have resolved this problem by adopting crassulacean acid metabolism, allowing them to open their stomata during the night to allow CO2 to enter, and close them during the day, or by using C4 carbon fixation.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, a {{huge number}} of Rome's finest troops, {{including}} most of the Gaul comitatus and perhaps half the combined Eastern/Illyricum force, were wiped out in the civil war. At the Battle of Mursa in Pannonia (351), one of the bloodiest in Roman history, Magnentius lost an estimated 24,000 men (perhaps two-thirds of his army). Constantius' army, although victorious, suffered even greater casualties (about 30,000). A final encounter at the Battle of Mons Seleucus in the Alps saw further heavy casualties. Such massive losses of first-grade troops could not quickly or easily be replaced. Constantius, now based in Milan, was left with an escort army of about 30,000, but Illyricum and the East had been stripped of their comitatus. With renewed Persian attacks, the East was the <b>top</b> <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> reinforcement and Illyricum second. In the circumstances, Constantius could only spare in the region of 13,000 men for the Gaul comitatus, about half its previous strength. The Frankish-born general Silvanus was appointed its commander (magister equitum).|$|E
5|$|The episodes took {{seventeen}} days to film, where normally crew {{are given}} eight days to film a week's worth of episodes. Between forty and forty-five members of crew were required for filming the fire episode, including assistant directors, a design department, cameras, lighting, sound, make up, costume, visual effects, fire safety officers and a stunt team {{consisting of a}} stunt co-ordinator and stunt doubles. Filming was done with four television cameras, a steadicam and a dolly. The exterior fire scenes were filmed first, in five night shoots lasting until 4a.m., and the real exterior set was burnt. Safety was the <b>top</b> <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> the fire scenes, and fire safety advisors ensured all cast and crew were protected. Stunt doubles wore flame-proof gel on their faces and for the scene where Ryan and Stacey fall from the ladder, several layers of cardboard boxes were stacked {{on the ground for}} the stunt doubles to fall onto. For filming the final explosion scene, all the actors whose characters were involved were filmed separately for their reactions. The explosion had to be delayed due to a power failure at Elstree Studios, two minutes before the explosion was due to be set off, which also affected a live broadcast of Big Brother. The power cut lasted two hours and filming was further delayed due to rain. The explosion was completed in a third take. Despite the delay, the scenes were completed on schedule. Salisbury noted that the demise of such an iconic set as The Queen Victoria left several cast members in tears.|$|E

She won the November general election, defeating Independent Ron Devon, the husband of Mudflats author Jeanne Devon, 58.8% to 40.7%. She campaigned on the position of pro natural resource development, in-state gasline development, increased economic development, and oil tax reform.

The <b>top</b> <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> bridge construction was a new Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge. Whitehurst proposed spending $650,000 in fiscal 1939 to survey and design the structure and begin its construction. Whitehurst's proposal received the immediate support of the Hillcrest Citizens Association, which began lobbying the District Commissioners to seek the appropriation yet again.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{for example}} the English Premier League, the top three teams of the Norwegian Premier League are awarded medals.

500|$|The German {{attitude}} to underground education varied {{depending on whether}} it {{took place in the}} General Government or the annexed territories. The Germans had almost certainly realized the full scale of the Polish underground education system by about 1943, but lacked the manpower {{to put an end to}} it, probably prioritizing resources to dealing with the armed resistance. For the most part, closing underground schools and colleges in the General Government was not a <b>top</b> <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> the Germans. In 1943 a German report on education admitted that control of what was being taught in schools, particularly rural ones, was difficult, due to lack of manpower, transportation, and the activities of the Polish resistance. Some schools semi-openly taught unauthorized subjects in defiance of the German authorities. Hans Frank noted in 1944 that although Polish teachers were a [...] "mortal enemy" [...] of the German states, they could not all be disposed of immediately. It was perceived as a much more serious issue in the annexed territories, as it hindered the process of Germanization; involvement in the underground education in those territories was much more likely to result in a sentence to a concentration camp.|$|E

But Holden was initially unimpressed with Lin's on-court abilities, and told Lin's high school basketball coach, Peter Diepenbrock, that Lin was a [...] "Division III player". Later that week, Holden saw Lin playing in a much more competitive game, driving to the basket at every opportunity with the [...] "instincts of a killer", and Lin became a <b>top</b> <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> him. Harvard coaches feared that Stanford, close to Lin's home, would offer Lin a scholarship, but it did not, and Lin chose to attend Harvard. [...] "I wasn't sitting there saying all these Division I coaches were knuckleheads," [...] Diepenbrock said. [...] "There were legitimate questions about Jeremy." [...] Joe Lacob, incoming Warriors owner and Stanford booster, said Stanford's failure to recruit Lin [...] "was really stupid. The kid was right across the street.
