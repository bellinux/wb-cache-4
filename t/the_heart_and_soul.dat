That's what happened and that's what he's gone through, and that's that.” Jackson felt <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>soul</b> of the character were still the same; the foundation of Lucky was still the product of Luke and Laura. He described his portrayal as working through the contradictory traits Lucky inherited from his parents, the purity of Laura versus the con artist side of Luke. He explained that he was taking the essence of being their son and translating him into adulthood.|$|E
25|$|Once a {{major part}} of the NASCAR circuit North Carolina now only has one track on the schedule, Charlotte.

Charlotte also hosts NASCAR's longest and most grueling race, the Coca-Cola 600, every May. The winner of the race earns tremendous respect among peers and fans due to the distance (the longest on the circuit) and the weather (North Carolina is known for extremely humid and hot summers). During race weeks Concord is said to balloon from its normal population of just under 56,000 to over 300,000.|$|E

25|$|Looking at {{that picture}} today makes me cringe. It {{was done in}} the worst {{possible}} taste. Back then I was too immature to see that. Shame on me—I should have done everything in my power to stop it. The record company came up with the idea, I think. The lyrics incidentally were a take-off on Kiss, whom we had just supported on a tour. I was fooling around and played the riff of the song in the rehearsal room and spontaneously improvised 'cause he's a virgin killer!' trying to do a more or less way-off-the-mark Paul Stanley impersonation. Klaus immediately said 'that's great! You should do something with it.' Then I had the unenviable task of constructing a meaningful set of lyrics around the title, which I actually managed to do to some degree. But the song has a totally different meaning from what people would assume at first. Virgin Killer is none other than the demon of our time, the less compassionate side of the societies we live in today—brutally trampling upon <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>soul</b> of innocence.|$|E

[...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it a three star rating, saying that Dhoom 2 is without doubt better than its predecessor, and that Hrithik Roshan is <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>soul</b> of the film.

[...] Kirkman added that it was difficult to release DeMunn from the cast. He stated: [...] "It’s heartbreaking to lose Jeffrey DeMunn. He's really given us a lot, these last two seasons on the show. It's been amazing to work with him and get to know him and he’s an awesome dude and we’re definitely going to miss him." ...|$|E

The change was a practical decision, as the production was behind schedule and they needed to cut costs. The schedule called for two days to be spent filming the crash, but only half a day was available. Ball agreed, {{but only if the}} scene could retain a line of Ricky's where he reflects on having once seen a dead homeless woman: [...] "When you see something like that, it's like God is looking right at you, just for a second.

500|$|After {{the release}} of the music video for [...] "Hollywood", Samuel Bourdin, the son of Guy Bourdin, filed a federal lawsuit that accused Madonna of ripping off the work of his father. Bourdin said they are [...] "strikingly similar" [...] to {{pictures}} taken by his father from the 1950s to 1980s decades and published in French Vogue magazine. He accused Madonna of copyright infringement over at least eleven of Bourdin's works, including one of Madonna with her legs spread on top of a TV set. [...] "It's one thing to draw inspiration; it's quite another to simply plagiarize <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>soul</b> of my father's work", Bourdin said at the time. Included in Bourdin's federal complaint were side-by-side comparisons of his father's work with images with stills from the [...] "Hollywood" [...] video. According to Dustin Robertson, editor of the [...] "Hollywood" [...] video, the sequences featuring Madonna in a red dress staring into a mirror are the ones which were pointed by Bourdin's estate in the lawsuit. The lawsuit named Madonna, Warner Bros. Records, and Mondino as defendants. The details presented in the lawsuit read as: [...] "Factors such as composition, background, wardrobe, lighting, narrative, camera angle, decor, and objects depicted are strikingly similar... There are very few scenes or sequences in the 'Hollywood' video that are not directly derived from the Bourdin works." [...] Details of the financial settlement are confidential, and Madonna acknowledged no wrongdoing in her liberal appropriation of the images. Bourdin's lawyer, John Koegel, said the parties reached a [...] "very, very successful settlement", adding that terms of the deal did not allow him to discuss exact dollar amounts. In 2011, news website Independent Online disclosed the settled amount by Madonna to be $600,000.|$|E
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the first season, one of the show's animators confirmed that [...] "Derpy" [...] would be a scripted background character in the second season, and was a part of several sight gags. In the original broadcast of the mid-season episode [...] "The Last Roundup" [...] {{as well as on the}} home media The Friendship Express release, [...] "Derpy" [...] was called out by name by Rainbow Dash, and given lines (as voiced by St. Germain) and klutzy mannerisms as a direct call-out to the brony fandom. Though most of the fans appreciated the inclusion, some viewers had a negative response to the character, believing her portrayal insulted the mentally handicapped. Hasbro subsequently modified these scenes, and while [...] "Derpy" [...] is still present in subsequent broadcast and digital versions of the episode, she is not named, and a different voice is used. According to Hasbro's Nicole Agnello, [...] "Some viewers felt that aspects of the episode 'The Last Roundup' did not stay true to the core message of friendship which is <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>soul</b> of the series. Hasbro Studios decided to make slight audio alterations to this single episode." [...] Despite Hasbro's intentions, some members of the brony community were disappointed, and some made efforts to restore the original voice. [...] "Derpy" [...] remained in background cameos throughout other episodes in season 2 and 3. Within season 4, Derpy was re-introduced, remaining silent and unnamed but with her original wall-eyed look, as a side character in the main story of [...] "Rainbow Falls". The appearance was planned as a big reveal for the brony fans, according to co-director Jim Miller, and that [...] "she is here to stay" [...] according to Hasbro's vice president for entertainment Mike Vogel. The Derpy character is used often on Hasbro's marketing of the show. For example, Hasbro's exclusive pony toy at the Comic-Con International and My Little Pony Fair in 2012 was based on [...] "Derpy", and has the same cross-eye look.|$|E
