The new [...] "pressure carburetor" [...] design replaced the float-operated fuel inlet valve with a servo-operated poppet-style fuel metering valve.|$|E
50|$|Quadrajet carburetors have {{mechanical}} secondary <b>throttle</b> <b>plates</b> {{operated by}} a progressive linkage; the primaries open before the secondaries, and use on-demand air valve plates above the secondary <b>throttle</b> <b>plates.</b> The air valves are connected by a cam and linkage to the secondary fuel metering rods. As the airflow increases through the secondary bores, the air valves are pushed down, rotating a cam that lifts the secondary metering rods. The secondary rods are tapered {{in a similar fashion}} to the primary metering rods, effectively increasing the size of the fuel metering holes as the rods are lifted and delivering more fuel. Therefore, the position of the air valve will control both fuel and air flow through the secondary venturis, even if the secondary <b>throttle</b> <b>plates</b> are fully opened. Thus the Quadrajet acts like a vacuum-secondary carburetor and only delivers more fuel as it is needed.|$|E
50|$|The largest piece {{inside the}} {{throttle}} body is the <b>throttle</b> <b>plate,</b> {{which is a}} butterfly valve that regulates the airflow.|$|R
50|$|As the {{throttle}} is opened up {{slightly from the}} fully closed position, the <b>throttle</b> <b>plate</b> uncovers additional fuel delivery holes behind the <b>throttle</b> <b>plate</b> {{where there is a}} low pressure area created by {{the throttle}} plate/Valve blocking air flow; these allow more fuel to flow as well as compensating for the reduced vacuum that occurs when the throttle is opened, thus smoothing the transition to metering fuel flow through the regular open throttle circuit.|$|R
5000|$|In 1991, California Golf, Jetta, Fox, Cabriolet and Corrado {{vehicles}} were equipped with expanded OBD capabilities. This version was renamed [...] "Digifant I". These later Digifant versions have 38-pin ECMs with Rapid Data Transfer and permanent DTC memory. All Eurovans with Digifant also have rapid data transfer and permanent DTC memory. These systems use a <b>throttle</b> <b>plate</b> potentiometer to track <b>throttle</b> <b>plate</b> position {{in place of}} the idle and full throttle switches used on earlier systems.|$|R
5000|$|Wide open {{throttle}} (WOT) {{refers to}} an internal combustion engine's maximum intake of air and fuel that occurs when the <b>throttle</b> <b>plates</b> inside the carburetor or throttle body are [...] "wide open", providing the least resistance to the incoming air.

50|$|Economy. Unlike {{most other}} four-barrel carburetors, the Quadrajet has a {{drastically}} different sized {{primary and secondary}} bores. The much smaller primaries act as a small two-barrel carburetor until the accelerator is pressed far enough to start to open the secondaries. The small primaries allow the primary <b>throttle</b> <b>plates</b> to be opened wider, and thus making the carburetor more efficient than a large two barrel, or square bore four-barrel.|$|E
40|$|An axial {{oscillation}} tool is {{proved to be}} effective in solving problems associated with high friction and torque in the sliding drilling of a complex well. The fluidic {{axial oscillation}} tool, based on an output-fed bistable fluidic oscillator, is a type of axial oscillation tool which has become increasingly popular in recent years. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze the dynamic flow behavior of a fluidic axial oscillation tool with the absence of a <b>throttling</b> <b>plate</b> in order to evaluate its overall performance. In particular, the differences between the original design with a <b>throttling</b> <b>plate</b> and the current default design are profoundly analyzed, and an improvement is expected to be recorded for the latter. A commercial computational fluid dynamics code, Fluent, was used to predict the pressure drop and oscillation frequency of a fluidic axial oscillation tool. The results of the numerical simulations agree well with corresponding experimental results. A sufficient pressure pulse amplitude with a low pressure drop is desired in this study. Therefore, a relative pulse amplitude of pressure drop and displacement are introduced in our study. A comparison analysis between the two designs with and without a <b>throttling</b> <b>plate</b> indicates that when the supply flow rate is relatively low or higher than a certain value, the fluidic axial oscillation tool with a <b>throttling</b> <b>plate</b> exhibits a better performance; otherwise, the fluidic axial oscillation tool without a <b>throttling</b> <b>plate</b> seems to be a preferred alternative. In most of the operating circumstances in terms of the supply flow rate and pressure drop, the fluidic axial oscillation tool performs better than the original design...|$|R

5000|$|The rate of airflow {{through an}} {{internal}} combustion engine {{is an important factor}} determining the amount of power the engine generates. Most gasoline engines are controlled by limiting that flow with a throttle that restricts intake airflow, while a diesel engine is controlled by the amount of fuel supplied to the cylinder, and so has no [...] "throttle" [...] as such. Manifold vacuum is present in all naturally aspirated engines that use throttles (including carbureted and fuel injected gasoline engines using the Otto cycle or the two-stroke cycle; diesel engines do not have <b>throttle</b> <b>plates).</b>|$|E

5000|$|For 1963, Coventry Climax {{was able}} to {{convince}} Lucas to supply the cogged belt driven fuel injection system originally developed for BRM with then-unique sliding <b>throttle</b> <b>plates</b> with four round intake bores cut out. With the larger bore (from 63 mm to 68 mm) and shorter stroke (60 mm to 51.5 mm) compared to Mk.II, notable changes include the increase in conrod length (from 4.2" [...] to 5.1" [...] center to center, with a shorter piston crown height) and the switch from crossplane to flatplane crankshaft, which surprisingly did not increase vibration in the higher RPM range because the longer conrod length counteracted the increase in secondary vibration inherent in flatplane design.|$|E
50|$|When {{the driver}} presses on the {{accelerator}} pedal, the <b>throttle</b> <b>plate</b> rotates within the throttle body, opening the throttle passage to allow more air into the intake manifold. Usually an airflow sensor measures this change and communicates with the ECU. The ECU then increases the amount of fuel {{being sent to the}} fuel injectors in order to obtain the desired air-fuel ratio. Often a throttle position sensor (TPS) is connected to the shaft of the <b>throttle</b> <b>plate</b> to provide the ECU with information on whether the throttle is in the idle position, wide-open throttle (WOT) position, or somewhere in between these extremes.|$|R

50|$|Both the 4300A and 4300D {{are unique}} {{by virtue of}} having spread bore <b>throttle</b> <b>plate</b> designs (the 4300A being much less {{pronounced}} than the 4300D) that are unique to these carburetors and their relative intake mainfolds.|$|R
50|$|The {{intake system}} was {{simplified}} in shape to reduce induction resistance and noise. A larger twin-chambered air box designed to dampen resonant intake tract noise replaces the previous Accord's smaller, single-chamber damper. The new box is 10.7 liters in capacity, {{compared to the}} older unit's 8.2 liters. The larger box also {{eliminates the need for}} a second resonant-frequency damper and an additional side branch. The 2.3-liter Accord 4-cylinder engine intake manifold has been redesigned to add more power and lower emissions. The individual cast-aluminum runners have revised dimensions to better take advantage of the different air-flow characteristics of the 2.3-liter engine. A larger plenum chamber reduces induction noise and the incorporation of Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) ports into the plenum, upstream of the <b>throttle</b> <b>plates,</b> eliminates the need for a separate fitting and port in each intake runner.|$|E
50|$|The {{most notable}} {{change of the}} RC45 when {{released}} {{was the use of}} Programmed Fuel Injection. Fuel injection had been used on bikes previously but these had either been rather antiquated analog computers or very simple digital units with a minimal number of sensors for input, which resulted in very crude fueling. The RC30 had used 38 mm constant velocity carburettors which, for road use are quite nice, maintaining a high air velocity across a wide rpm range, though were not as well suited for racing. The RC45 did away with carburetors and in their absence a brace of four 46 mm throttles were replaced, Honda now had the throttle area it needed to make big horsepower at high revolutions. The system Honda used on the RC45 was very similar to the system used on the NR750. Contrary to popular belief the RC45’s fuel injection is not like a 4-stage carburetor, rather it is a proper fuel only system. Honda kept the ignition system separate. The Honda system obtained information from the following sensors: crankshaft position sensor, camshaft position sensor, air temperature sensor, coolant temperature sensor, manifold absolute pressure sensor, throttle position sensor, barometric sensor and battery voltage. With all of these sensors relaying information to the ECU, Honda could have quite easily incorporated the ignition control unit. The reason that they had not came down to the supplier of parts: they had different manufacturers supplying the ecu and cdi units. Regardless, it allowed the use of very large <b>throttle</b> <b>plates</b> seamlessly over a very wide engine operating range. The engine of the RC45 also used many magnesium castings, as of rather recently, it has become quite common to see fuel injection and magnesium engine parts on motorcycles, though in the early-to-mid 1990’s this was expensive and incredibly innovative.|$|E
5000|$|Reduced {{throttling}} losses. The {{addition of}} inert exhaust gas into the intake system means {{that for a}} given power output, the <b>throttle</b> <b>plate</b> must be opened further, resulting in increased inlet manifold pressure and reduced throttling losses.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most basic}} {{carbureted}} engines, such as single cylinder Briggs & Stratton lawn-mower engines, feature a single small <b>throttle</b> <b>plate</b> over a basic carburetor {{with a single}} venturi. The throttle is either open or closed (although {{there is always a}} small hole or other bypass to allow a small amount of air to flow through so the engine can idle when the throttle is closed), or some intermediate position. Since air velocity is crucial to the functioning of a carburetor, to keep average air velocity up, larger engines require more complex carburetors with multiple small venturis, typically two or four (these venturis are commonly called [...] "barrels). A typical [...] "2-barrel" [...] carburetor uses a single oval or rectangular <b>throttle</b> <b>plate,</b> and works similarly to a single venturi carburetor, but with two small openings instead of one. A 4-venturi carburetor has two pairs of venturis, each pair regulated by a single oval or rectangular <b>throttle</b> <b>plate.</b> Under normal operation, only one <b>throttle</b> <b>plate</b> (the [...] "primary") opens when the accelerator pedal is pressed, allowing more air into the engine, but keeping overall airflow velocity through the carburetor high (thus improving efficiency). The [...] "secondary" [...] throttle is operated either mechanically when the primary plate is opened past a certain amount, or via engine vacuum, influenced by the position of the accelerator pedal and engine load, allowing for greater air flow into the engine at high RPM and load and better efficiency at low RPM's. Multiple 2-venturi or 4-venturi carburetors can be used simultaneously in situations where maximum engine power is of priority.|$|R
5000|$|An {{alternative}} method for utilizing both a MAF and a blowoff valve {{is to have}} the MAF located down stream between the intercooler and the <b>throttle</b> <b>plate.</b> This is known as Blow-through rather than the traditional Draw-through set up. Care must be taken as to the position of the MAF to prevent damage to the sensitive element. For example, on a SR20DET engine, the MAF must be at least 12" [...] from the <b>throttle</b> <b>plate,</b> and the blowoff valve must be 6" [...] from the MAF sensor. By using a blow-through method, the MAF won't be affected by the blowoff valve opening as the pressure is vented before the air reaches the MAF.|$|R
50|$|Some {{multipoint}} injection engines route engine coolant through the throttle body to prevent ice buildup during prolonged idling. This prevents ice from forming around the <b>throttle</b> <b>plate</b> {{but does not}} draw large amounts of hot air into the engine as carburetor heat does.|$|R
40|$|A new {{throttling}} system far SI engines is examined. The SMD {{of the fuel}} droplets in the induction system is measured to evaluate {{the performance of the}} new device with respect to the conventional <b>throttle</b> <b>plate</b> arrangement. The measurements are conducted at steady now conditions. A forward angular scattering technique with a He-Ne laser beam is used for droplet size measurement. The experiments are carried out with different mixture strength, stream velocity and throttle positions. It is observed that A/F ratio has no effect on SMD. However, stream velocity and throttle position have a significant influence on SMD. The new throttling method is found to be more effective in reducing the SMD, particularly at low throttle opening and high stream velocity compared to the conventional <b>throttle</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Most modern engines {{use some}} type of fuel {{injection}} to deliver fuel to the cylinders. The ECU determines the amount of fuel to inject based {{on a number of}} sensor readings. Oxygen sensors tell the ECU whether the engine is running rich (too much fuel/too little oxygen) or running lean (too much oxygen/too little fuel) as compared to ideal conditions (known as stoichiometric). The throttle position sensors tell the ECU how far the <b>throttle</b> <b>plate</b> is opened when you press the accelerator. The mass air flow sensor measures the amount of air flowing into the engine through the <b>throttle</b> <b>plate.</b> The engine coolant temperature sensor measures whether the engine is warmed up or cool. (If the engine is still cool, additional fuel will be injected.) ...|$|R
5000|$|If the airflow {{into the}} engine is {{increased}} - by opening the <b>throttle</b> <b>plate,</b> or by allowing the engine revolutions to rise with the <b>throttle</b> <b>plate</b> at a constant setting - the pressure drop in the venturi increases, the pressure above the piston falls, and the piston is sucked upwards, increasing {{the size of the}} venturi, until the pressure drop in the venturi returns to its nominal level. Similarly if the airflow into {{the engine is}} reduced, the piston will fall. The result is that the pressure drop in the venturi remains the same regardless of the speed of the airflow - hence the name [...] "constant depression" [...] for carburettors operating on this principle - but the piston rises and falls according to the speed of the airflow.|$|R
50|$|Having a {{buildup of}} sludge can cause lower {{performance}} due to the limiting effect it has on the air flow to the engine. If the buildup becomes excessive on the throttle body it can cause poor idling as it can block the air flow whilst the <b>throttle</b> <b>plate</b> is shut.|$|R
5000|$|If the airflow {{into the}} engine is {{increased}} - by opening the <b>throttle</b> <b>plate</b> (usually {{referred to as the}} [...] "butterfly"), or by allowing the engine revs to rise with the <b>throttle</b> <b>plate</b> at a constant setting - the pressure drop in the venturi increases, the pressure above the piston falls, and the piston is sucked upwards, increasing the size of the venturi, until the pressure drop in the venturi returns to its nominal level.

50|$|Two {{separate}} throttle {{bodies are}} used, each incorporating two <b>throttle</b> butterfly <b>plates.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{blowoff valve}} is {{connected}} by a vacuum hose to the intake manifold after the <b>throttle</b> <b>plate.</b> When the <b>throttle</b> is closed, the relative manifold pressure drops below atmospheric pressure and the resulting pressure differential operates the blowoff valve's piston. The excess pressure from the turbocharger is then vented into the atmosphere or recirculated into the intake upstream of the compressor inlet.|$|R
5000|$|Multiair is a {{hydraulically}} actuated {{variable valve}} timing (VVT) engine technology enabling [...] "cylinder by cylinder, stroke by stroke" [...] control of intake air directly via a gasoline engine's inlet valves. Developed by Fiat Powertrain Technologies, the technology bypasses a primary engine inefficiency: pumping losses caused by restriction of the intake passage by the <b>throttle</b> <b>plate,</b> used to regulate air feeding the cylinders.|$|R
50|$|The major {{advantages}} of a GDI engine are increased fuel efficiency and high power output. Emissions levels can also be more accurately controlled with the GDI system. The cited gains are achieved by the precise control over the amount of fuel and injection timings that are varied according to engine load. In addition some engines operate on full air intake. This means there is no air <b>throttle</b> <b>plate,</b> which greatly improves efficiency, and reduces piston 'pumping losses'. It also eliminates air throttling losses in some GDI engines, when compared with conventional fuel-injected or carbureted engines. Engine speed {{is controlled by the}} engine control unit/engine management system (EMS), which regulates fuel injection function and ignition timing, instead of having a <b>throttle</b> <b>plate</b> that restricts the incoming air supply. Adding this function to the EMS requires considerable enhancement of its processing and memory, as direct injection plus the engine speed management must have very precise algorithms for good performance and drivability.|$|R
50|$|Engines {{equipped}} with fuel injection {{do not require}} carb heat as {{they are not as}} prone to icing - the gasoline is injected as a steady stream just upstream of the intake valve, so evaporation occurs as the fuel/air mixture is being drawn into the cylinder, where metal temperatures are higher. The exception is monopoint or TBI injection systems which spray fuel onto the <b>throttle</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|R
50|$|Additional {{functions}} of the ECM include operation of the fuel pump by closing the Ground for the fuel pump relay, and control of idle speed by a <b>throttle</b> <b>plate</b> bypass valve. The Idle Air Control Valve (IACV) (previously known as an Idle Air Stabiliser Valve - IASV), receives a changing milliamp signal that varies the strength of an electromagnet pulling open the bypass valve.|$|R
50|$|The Valvematic system offers {{continuous}} {{adjustment to}} lift volume and timing and improves fuel efficiency by controlling the fuel/air mixture using valve control rather than conventional <b>throttle</b> <b>plate</b> control. The technology {{made its first}} appearance in 2007 in the Noah and later in early-2009 in the ZR engine family used on the Avensis. This system is simpler in design compared to Valvetronic and VVEL, allowing the cylinder head to remain at the same height.|$|R
