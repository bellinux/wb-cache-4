50|$|Aggressive {{throttle}} movements, {{engine speed}} changes, and engine motoring are characteristics of most transient engine tests. The usual {{purpose of these}} tests are vehicle emissions development and homologation. In some cases, the lower-cost eddy-current dynamometer is used to test one of the transient test cycles for early development and calibration. An eddy current dyno system offers fast load response, which allows rapid tracking of speed and load, but does not allow motoring. Since most required <b>transient</b> <b>tests</b> contain {{a significant amount of}} motoring operation, a transient test cycle with an eddy-current dyno will generate different emissions test results.

The group with lower degradation regards the steels Q 460 (by Wang et al., 2005) and S 690 Q (by Chen et al., 2008). The elastic modulus in the first study was obtained from steady-state tests (through the frequency approach) {{and in the second}} one from both steady-state and <b>transient</b> <b>tests.</b> It is also reported by Chen et al.

40|$|In this work, {{we propose}} a new {{interpretation}} of pressure <b>transient</b> <b>tests</b> conducted {{in more than}} sixty wells targeting the Dogger formation in the Paris basin. The most part of these wells were drilled during the eighties over {{a very short period}} of time in an urban area. The <b>transient</b> <b>tests</b> were only recorded during a pressure buildup and show that contrary to what has long been assumed the Dogger aquifer behavior is not homogeneous. The interpretation of the obtained data was mainly done with Horner's method, independently for each well, and assuming generally that the aquifer is homogeneous. Available data from pressure <b>transient</b> <b>tests</b> are limited because of the precision of the tools used, and because pressure buildup was only recorded during eight to twelve hours. The objective was to determine the average transmissivity and the skin factor in order to obtain the productivity of the wells. We gather all available data, including those obtained on the thirteen recent wells, and propose a new interpretation in terms of aquifer model. We use the pressure derivative method developed in the nineties for oil reservoirs which allows a better visualization of the model and of the heterogeneity of the aquifer. Most of the well tests have a derivative pressure curve with a slope equal to zero, that does not change after the well bore effects, confirming that the aquifer is relatively homogenous. However on a dozen of wells, data from pressure <b>transient</b> <b>tests</b> display singular behaviors that can be related to a double porosity or double permeability model for some wells and to a composite model for others (figure 1). These observations question the validity of a homogeneous model for the Dogger aquifer in the Paris basin and the currently used parameters for the thermal and hydrodynamic predictive model of geothermal exploitation. Finally, this work, supported by the French agency of environment and renewable energy (ADEME), increases our understanding of the Dogger aquifer in the Paris basin and will allow the optimization of the ongoing hydraulic tests and the future exploitation of geothermal energy in the area...|$|E

40|$|A {{steady state}} test {{procedure}} {{has been developed}} and implemented on an extensively instrumented production diesel engine to estimate the total energy transfer to coolant over a New European Drive Cycle. The test procedure involved segmenting the drive cycle into 26 operating conditions, each with a corresponding weighting factor.
