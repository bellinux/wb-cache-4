25|$|The chassis of the E140 {{is based}} on the Toyota MC platform, with the E150 model {{deriving}} from the New MC platform.

The versions sold in the Americas, Southeast Asia and <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>are</b> based on the widened edition of this platform, so they retain the E140 designation. Models sold in Australia, Europe and South Africa use the more sophisticated New MC underpinnings, and are thus designated as E150.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the first Middle Eastern farmers had North African influences mainly from The Capsian culture. There have been suggestions that some genetic lineages found in the Middle East arrived there during this period. The first Agricultural societies in <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>are</b> generally thought to have emerged from the Natufian Culture, which existed in Palestine from 12,000 BCE-10,000 BCE. An important migration from North-West Africa occurred by the Ibero-Maurisians from Morocco across the Sinai appears to have occurred before the formation of the Natufian.|$|E
500|$|P. c. abietinus {{occurs in}} Scandinavia and {{northern}} Russia, and winters from southeastern Europe and northeastern Africa east to Iraq and western Iran. It is intermediate in appearance between P. c. tristis and P. c. collybita, being grey-washed olive-green above with a pale yellow supercilium, and underparts whiter than in P. c. collybita, {{but it has}} very similar vocalisations to the nominate subspecies. Due to individual variation, {{it can be difficult}} to reliably separate P. c. abietinus and P. c. collybita outside their main breeding and wintering ranges. Some common chiffchaffs in <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>are</b> browner and have a more disyllabic swee-hu call than P. c. abietinus, and may belong to a poorly known taxon [...] "brevirostris"; further research is needed to clarify the affinities of this form.|$|E

500|$|OPEC {{often has}} {{difficulty}} agreeing on policy decisions because its member countries differ widely in their oil export capacities, production costs, reserves, geological features, population, economic development, budgetary situations, and political circumstances. Indeed, {{over the course}} of market cycles, oil reserves can themselves become a source of serious conflict, instability and imbalances, in what economists call the [...] "natural resource curse". A further complication is that religion-linked conflicts in <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>are</b> recurring features of the geopolitical landscape for this oil-rich region. Internationally important conflicts in OPEC's history have included the Six-Day War (1967), Yom Kippur War (1973), a hostage siege directed by Palestinian militants (1975), the Iranian Revolution (1979), Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988), Iraqi occupation of Kuwait (1990–1991), September 11 attacks by mostly Saudi hijackers (2001), American occupation of Iraq (2003–2011), Conflict in the Niger Delta (2004–present), Arab Spring (2010–2012), Libyan Crisis (2011–present), and international Embargo against Iran (2012–2016). Although events such as these can temporarily disrupt oil supplies and elevate prices, the frequent disputes and instabilities tend to limit OPEC's long-term cohesion and effectiveness.|$|E
