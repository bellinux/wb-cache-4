5|$|Chad's {{legal system}} {{is based on}} French civil law and Chadian {{customary}} law where the latter does not interfere with public order or constitutional guarantees of equality. Despite the constitution's guarantee of judicial independence, the president names most key judicial officials. The legal system's highest jurisdictions, <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>and</b> the Constitutional Council, have become fully operational since 2000. The Supreme Court {{is made up of}} a chief justice, named by the president, and 15 councillors, appointed for life by the president and the National Assembly. The Constitutional Court is headed by nine judges elected to nine-year terms. It has the power to review legislation, treaties and international agreements prior to their adoption.|$|E

Following the conviction, Jim Bell renewed his attempts at firing his court-appointed lawyer, appealing his case to <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court,</b> <b>and</b> filing civil lawsuits against those he alleges were involved in an orchestrated conspiracy to deny him a fair trial and an unbiased, court-appointed defense counsel; his targets included two judges, at least two prosecutors, and his former probation officers and defense attorneys.|$|E

5|$|Historically {{influenced}} by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as Kujikata Osadamegaki. However, {{since the late}} 19th century the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of Europe, notably Germany. For example, in 1896, the Japanese government established a civil code based on {{a draft of the}} German Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch; with the code remaining in effect with post–World War II modifications. Statutory law originates in Japan's legislature and has the rubber stamp of the Emperor. Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>and</b> three levels of lower courts. The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes.|$|E

With the new court, all prior judges lost their seats and the three positions were filled by appointment of the governor. Boise was appointed by Governor W. W. Thayer to the new court in 1878, with his term ending in 1880. During his time with the court, he served as chief justice three times; from 1864 to 1866, 1870 to 1872, and 1876 to 1878.|$|E
