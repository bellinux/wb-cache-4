A 30 -arcsec aperture (FWHM) was used. Measurements centered on the nuclear condensation micron indicate that if present, the 20 micron silicate feature is very weak, and that a relatively narrow strong feature centered at 28. 4 microns possibly exists.

Best values for the line strengths, pressure-broadening coefficients, diffusion constants, and pressure shifts for these rotational transitions are calculated.

50|$|Most astronomical {{observations}} are conducted by measuring photons (electromagnetic waves) which originate beyond the sky. The molecules in the Earth's atmosphere, however, absorb and emit their own light, {{especially in the}} visible and near-IR portion of the spectrum, and any ground-based observation is subject to contamination from these <b>telluric</b> (earth-originating) sources. <b>Water</b> vapor, oxygen, and OH {{are some of the}} more important molecules in <b>telluric</b> contamination. <b>Water</b> contamination was particularly pronounced in the Mount Wilson solar Doppler measurements.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} catalog of J-band spectra for 88 {{fundamental}} MK standard stars observed at a resolving power of R ~ 3000. This contribution serves as a companion atlas to the K-band spectra published by Wallace and Hinkle (1997) and the H-band atlas of Meyer et al. (1998). We report data from 7400 - 9550 1 /cm (1. 05 - 1. 34 microns) for stars of spectral types O 7 -M 6 and luminosity classes I-V as defined in the MK system. In reducing these data, special care has been taken to remove time-variable <b>telluric</b> features of <b>water</b> vapor. We identify atomic and molecular indices which are both temperature and luminosity sensitive that aid in the classification of stellar spectra in the J-band. In addition to being useful in the classification of late-type stars, the J-band contains several features {{of interest in the}} study of early-type stellar photospheres. These data are available electronically for anonymous FTP in addition to being served on the World Wide Web.

An average electron density Pn regions where oxygen is doubly ionized was derived. The electron density calculated for M 82 is significantly lower than {{those found in the}} galaxy using the same method.

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, NASA's Kuiper Airborne Observatory (KAO) has made it {{possible}} to conduct pioneering observations of far infrared lines from astronomical sources. Such observations, in the case of wavelengths in the approximate range from 20 to 350 microns, cannot be performed from ground-based sites, because of <b>telluric</b> <b>water</b> absorption effects. Lines in the considered range provide information about the interstellar gas in molecular, neutral atomic, and ionized form of occurrence. The present paper provides a description of the development of the cryogenic optical system of a spectrometer designed to exploit the potential of the KAO for observing the far infrared lines.

40|$|Time-variable {{absorption}} {{by water}} vapor in Earth's atmosphere presents {{an important source}} of systematic error {{for a wide range of}} ground-based astronomical measurements, particularly at near-infrared wavelengths. We present results from the first study on the temporal and spatial variability of water vapor absorption at Apache Point Observatory (APO). We analyze ∼ 400, 000 high-resolution, near-infrared (H-band) spectra of hot stars collected as calibration data for the APO Galactic Evolution Explorer (APOGEE) survey. We fit for the optical depths of <b>telluric</b> <b>water</b> vapor absorption features in APOGEE spectra and convert these optical depths to Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) using contemporaneous data from a GPS-based PWV monitoring station at APO. Based on simultaneous measurements obtained over a 3 ^∘ field of view, we estimate that our PWV measurement precision is ± 0. 11 mm. We explore the statistics of PWV variations over a range of timescales from less than an hour to days. We find that the amplitude of PWV variations within an hour is less than 1 mm for most (96. 5...|$|E
40|$|Based on gas-phase {{laboratory}} spectra at 6 K, Campbell et al. (2015) {{confirmed that}} the diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) at 9632. 7 and 9577. 5 A are due to absorption by the fullerene ion C 60 +. They also reported the detection of two other, weaker bands at 9428. 5 and 9365. 9 A. These lie in spectral regions heavily contaminated by <b>telluric</b> <b>water</b> vapour lines. We acquired CFHT ESPaDOnS spectra of HD 183143 close to the zenith and chopped with a nearby standard to correct for the telluric line absorption which enabled us to detect a DIB at 9365. 9 A of relative width and strength comparable to the laboratory absorption. There is a DIB of similar strength and FWHM at 9362. 5 A. A stellar emission feature at 9429 A prevented detection of the 9428. 5 A band. However, a CFHT archival spectrum of HD 169454, where emission is absent at 9429 A, clearly shows the 9428. 5 A DIB with the expected strength and width. These results further confirm C 60 + as a DIB carrier. Comment: 16 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ Letter...|$|E
40|$|Galazutdinov et al. (2017) {{recently}} {{claimed that}} the relative strengths of the 9577 and 9632 Å diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) are too poorly correlated {{to be caused by}} a single source, the C 60 + ion. Their conclusion is based on theoretical modeling of contaminating stellar Mg ii lines at 9631. 9 and 9632. 4 Å and UVES spectra. This contradicts their earlier result and those of several others that the two DIBs are closely correlated and, within the errors and effects of stellar blends, exhibit an intensity ratio consistent with that found in the 6 K laboratory spectrum of C 60 +. We consider the use of close spectral standards to be superior to model atmosphere calculations in correcting for contamination by the Mg ii lines. We have examined some of the same UVES spectra and demonstrate that a lack of suitably observed telluric standards makes it impossible to adequately correct for <b>telluric</b> <b>water</b> vapor contamination, leading to unreliable continuum levels. The possible effects of higher temperatures, in the 30 – 100 K range, on the C 60 + electronic absorption band profiles, and their relative intensities, are also considered...|$|E
40|$|We {{attempt to}} confirm bright non-local {{thermodynamic}} equilibrium (non-LTE) emission from the exoplanet HD 189733 b at 3. 25 μm, as recently reported by Swain et al. based on observations at low spectral resolving power (λ/δλ ≈ 30). Non-LTE emission lines from gas in an exoplanet atmosphere {{will not be}} significantly broadened by collisions, so the measured emission intensity per resolution element must be substantially brighter when observed at high spectral resolving power. We observed the planet before, during, and after a secondary eclipse event at a resolving power λ/δλ = 27, 000 using the NIRSPEC spectrometer on the Keck II telescope. Our spectra cover a spectral window near the peak found by Swain et al., and we compare emission cases that {{could account for the}} magnitude and wavelength dependence of the Swain et al. result with our final spectral residuals. To model the expected line emission, we use a general non-equilibrium formulation to synthesize emission features from all plausible molecules that emit in this spectral region. In every case, we detect no line emission to a high degree of confidence. After considering possible explanations for the Swain et al. results and the disparity with our own data, we conclude that an astrophysical source for the putative non-LTE emission is unlikely. We note that the wavelength dependence of the signal seen by Swain et al. closely matches the 2 ν_ 2 band of water vapor at 300 K, and we suggest that an imperfect correction for <b>telluric</b> <b>water</b> {{is the source of the}} feature claimed by Swain et al...|$|E
40|$|Future radial velocity, astrometric, and direct-imaging surveys {{will find}} nearby Earth-sized planets within the {{habitable}} {{zone in the}} near future. How can we search for water and oxygen in those nontransiting planets? We show {{that a combination of}} high-dispersion spectroscopic and coronagraphic techniques is a promising technique to detect molecular lines imprinted in the scattered light of Earth-like planets (ELPs). In this method, the planetary signals are spectroscopically separated from telluric absorption by using the Doppler shift. Assuming a long observing campaign (a 10 -day exposure) using a high-dispersion spectrometer (R= 50, 000) with speckle suppression on a 30 -m telescope, we simulate the spectra from ELPs around M dwarfs (whose stellar effective temperature is 2750 - 3750 K) at 5 pc. Performing a cross-correlation analysis with the spectral template of the molecular lines, we find that raw contrasts of 10 ^- 4 and 10 ^- 5 (using Y, J, and H bands) are required to detect water vapor at the 3 σ and 16 σ levels, respectively, for T_= 3000 K. The raw contrast of 10 ^- 5 is required for a 6 σ detection of the oxygen 1. 27 μm band. We also examine possible systematics, incomplete speckle subtraction, and the correction for telluric lines. When those are not perfect, a <b>telluric</b> <b>water</b> signal appears in the cross-correlation function. However, we find the planetary signal is separated from that resulting from the velocity difference. We also find that the intrinsic water lines in the Phoenix spectra are too weak to affect the results for water detection. We conclude that a combination of high-dispersion spectroscopy and high-contrast instruments can be a powerful means to characterize ELPs in the extremely large telescope era.

40|$|Ground-based astronomical {{observations}} may {{be limited}} by <b>telluric</b> <b>water</b> vapor absorption, which is highly variable in time and significantly complicates both spectroscopy and photometry in the near-infrared (NIR). To achieve the sensitivity required to detect Earth-sized exoplanets in the NIR, simultaneous monitoring of precipitable water vapor (PWV) becomes necessary to mitigate the impact of variable telluric lines on radial velocity measurements and transit light curves. To address this issue, we present the Camera for the Automatic Monitoring of Atmospheric Lines (CAMAL), a stand-alone, inexpensive six-inch aperture telescope dedicated to measuring PWV at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory on Mount Hopkins. CAMAL utilizes three narrowband NIR filters to trace the amount of atmospheric water vapor affecting simultaneous observations with the MINiature Exoplanet Radial Velocity Array (MINERVA) and MINERVA-Red telescopes. Here we present the current design of CAMAL, discuss our data analysis methods, and show results from 11 nights of PWV measurements taken with CAMAL. For seven nights of data, we have independent PWV measurements extracted from high-resolution stellar spectra taken with the Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrometer (TRES) also located on Mount Hopkins. We use the TRES spectra to calibrate the CAMAL absolute PWV scale. Comparisons between CAMAL and TRES PWV estimates show excellent agreement, matching to within 1 mm over a 10 mm range in PWV. Analysis of CAMAL's photometric precision propagates to PWV measurements precise to better than 0. 5 mm in dry (PWV < 4 mm) conditions. We also find that CAMAL-derived PWVs are highly correlated with those from a GPS-based water vapor monitor located approximately 90 km away at Kitt Peak National Observatory, with a root mean square PWV difference of 0. 8 mm.

40|$|Absorption {{features}} centered near 0. 60 - 0. 65 and 0. 80 - 0. 90 micron {{were identified}} in the spectra of three low-albedo main-belt (165, 368, 877) and two low-albedo outer-belt (225, 334) asteroids (Vilas et al., Icarus, v. 109, 274, 1994). The absorption features were attributed to charge transfer transitions in iron alteration minerals such as goethite, hematite, and jarosite, all products of aqueous alteration. Concurrently, Jarvis et al. (LPSC XXIV, 715, 1993) presented additional spectra of low-albedo asteroids that had absorption features centered near 0. 60 - 0. 65 micron without the longer wavelength feature. Since these two features in iron oxides originate from the same ground state, and the longer wavelength feature requires less energy to exist, the single shorter wavelength feature cannot be caused by the iron alteration minerals. In addition, spectra of minerals such as hematite and goethite show a rapid increase in reflectance beginning near 0. 5 micron absent in the low-albedo asteroid spectra. The absence of this rise {{has been attributed to}} its suppresion from opaques in the surface material. Spectra on more than one night were available for only one of these five asteroids, 225 Henrietta, and showed good repeatability of the 0. 65 -micron feature. We have acquired additional spectra of all five asteroids in order to test the repeatability of the 0. 65 -micron feature, and the presence and repeatability of the features centered near 0. 8 - 0. 9 micron. We specifically will test the possibility that longer wavelength features could be caused by incomplete removal of <b>telluric</b> <b>water.</b> Asteroid 877 Walkure {{is a member of the}} Nysa-Hertha family, and will be compared to spectra of other members of that family.

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} {{very high}} quality reflectance spectra {{of the lunar}} surface from the University of Hawaii lunar spectral data collection using a spectral mixing model. The spectra analyzed are those of 45 mare sites and 75 highland sites. The spectra were {{selected on the basis}} of very high signal to noise ratios based on error bars and point to point scatter, and on quality of removal of <b>telluric</b> <b>water</b> bands. The spectral mixing model used 7 components, not all of which were used in each fit. Four of the components were mineral spectra of the orthopyroxene, a clinopyroxene, an olivine and an anorthite, measured at the Brown University's RELAB. All of the minerals were 45 - 90 micron splits. Lunar soil contains other components which have the effect of reddening and darkening the soil as well as reducing spectral contrast. In addition, lunar soil contains spectral neutral bright material (likely very fine grained feldspar) which serves to reduce spectral contrast and brighten soils. Early attempts to fit many of the spectra pointed out the need for a component which has a very broad smooth absorption feature centered near 1. 1 microns. Glass is a good candidate for this component. For the bright component we used a flat reflectance of 70 percent to represent fine grained feldspar. For the 'glass' component we used a telescopic spectrum of a pyroclastic glass present on the Aristarchus plateau which is characterized by a strong smooth band centered at 1. 07 microns. In addition to exhibiting the glass band this spectrum is very red and has a low albedo. On the assumption that the dark component and the red component are agglutinates, which is reasonable but not necessarily true, we sought a dark red component. To derive its properties we modelled the spectrum of an Apollo 16 soil (16 xxx) and assumed the dark red component to comprise 60 percent of the soil, appropriate to agglutinate abundance in mature soil. We adjusted the albedo and slope of a straight line representing the dark red component until the contrast and albedo of the model spectrum matched the soil spectrum. The mixing was done after conversion to a single scattering albedo...|$|E
40|$|Transit {{spectroscopy}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly used methods to characterize exoplanets atmospheres. From the ground, these observations are very challenging due to the terrestrial atmosphere and its intrinsic variations, but high-spectral resolution observations overcome this difficulty by resolving the spectral lines and taking advantage of the different Doppler velocities of the Earth, the host star and the exoplanet. We analyze the transmission spectrum around the Na I doublet at 589 nm of the exoplanet WASP- 69 b, a hot Jupiter orbiting a K-type star with a period of 3. 868 days, and compare the analysis to that of the well-know hot Jupiter HD 189733 b. We also present the analysis of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for WASP- 69 b. Two transits of WASP- 69 b were observed with the HARPS-North spectrograph (R = 115 000) at the TNG telescope. We perform a telluric contamination subtraction based on the comparison between the observed spectra and a <b>telluric</b> <b>water</b> model. Then, the common steps of the differential spectroscopy are followed to extract the transmission spectrum. The method is tested with archival transit data of the extensively studied exoplanet HD 189733 b, obtained with the HARPS-South spectrograph at ESO 3. 6 m telescope, and then applied to WASP- 69 b data. For HD 189733 b, we spectrally resolve the Na I doublet and measure line contrasts of 0. 72 ± 0. 05 % (D 2) and 0. 51 ± 0. 05 % (D 1), and FWHMs of 0. 64 ± 0. 04 Å (D 2) and 0. 60 ± 0. 06 Å (D 1), in agreement with previously published results. A net blueshift of ∼ 0. 04 Å is measured. For WASP- 69 b only the contrast of the D 2 line is measured (5. 8 ± 0. 3 %). Even if this corresponds to a detection at the 5 σ-level of excess absorption of 0. 5 ± 0. 1 % in a passband of 1. 5 Å, more transits are needed to fully characterize the lines profiles and retrieve accurate atmospheric properties.

40|$|The Scottish Borders fens {{represent}} an important group of British fen sites. Despite their small size {{many of these}} fens support various rare plant communities and nationally and locally rare plant species {{as well as a}} wide range of species characteristic of wetland habitats. This study has demonstrated the importance of management history, site chemical conditions and site size and morphology in the vegetation development of the Scottish Borders fens. 2. Sixty-eight sites were included in a general survey. The vegetation at these sites was systematically recorded. Site features (vegetation rafts, springs, drains), surrounding land-use, gross peat stratigraphy and measurements of pH and electrical conductivity of the fen water were also recorded. A subset of contrasting sites was selected for detailed investigations into site chemical conditions and peat fertility, peat stratigraphy and the development of vegetation rafts. The quadrat data were analysed using a range of multivariate classification procedures. One classification was selected {{as the basis for the}} description of Scottish Borders fen plant communities. Twenty-four plant communities and variants are described representing rich-fen, poor-fen, bog, tall herb fen, fen meadow and swamp habitat types. The Scottish Borders fen plant communities were compared to existing comprehensive classifications of British fen vegetation. 4. The impact of marl and peat extraction at each site was investigated using documentary, visual and stratigraphic evidence for disturbance at each site. The status of each site was determined (cutover, partly cutover, un-disturbed) and this was related to the development of the present vegetation. Most of the Scottish Borders fens have been cut for peat or marl to some extent. However at some sites the peat stratigraphic sequences represent un-modified peat development since the late glacial. The efficiency of drains, strength of springs and basin morphology are important factors determining the development of vegetation over former peat and marl cuttings. 5. Site chemical conditions show much variation. The intensity of the surrounding land-use is positively correlated with peat fertility at the edges and water inflows of sites. The main axes of floristic variation correspond to the variation in base-richness of the fen water and fertility. There was no simple relationship between chemical variables and the occurrence of different plant communities. 6. The vegetation has developed as a quaking raft over fluid peat at many sites. Two Sphagnum dominated plant communities are confined to vegetation rafts. Their occurrence is determined by the inundation of the vegetation surface with base-rich water, the depth of the fluid peat beneath the raft and the degree of isolation of the vegetation surface from <b>telluric</b> <b>water</b> input. Where the vegetation has developed as a raft over the entire site the thickest rafts are found in the central areas. The mechanisms of central raft thickening are thought to be influenced by differential fluctuation of the water table relative to the vegetation surface across sites...|$|E
