The first approximation applies when {{the thickness of the}} stratospheric layer is much larger than the <b>tropospheric</b> <b>layer,</b> such that the Froude number of the stratospheric layer is a small number. Using leading-order perturbation theory in the Hamiltonian formulation yields a conservative one-and-a-half isentropic layer model. Furthermore, when the Rossby number in this active lower layer is small, Hamiltonian theory either directly leads to (Salmon's) L 1 -dynamics using a geostrophic constraint, following a more concise derivation than shown before, or yields quasigeostrophic dynamics.

More than 3000 ozone anomalies were detected above Europe in vertical profiles in 1997 and 1998. The origin of the layers is identified with backward Lagrangian particle dispersion computations. Forward simulations are used to evaluate the growth rate of the plume in order to discuss the lifetime of the layers. Stratospheric intrusions are most sensitive to the horizontal strain, especially in winter, and the mixing of layers coming from the planetary boundary layer is enhanced by the summertime convection. The respective role of the origin of the layers and the seasonality is discussed, as well as the formation of streamers.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{assignment}} of altitude heights to satellite-derived atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs), commonly known as cloud-drift and water vapor (WV) -motion winds. The traditional practice of assigning AMV heights to discrete tropospheric levels is shown to be inadequate, and a superior methodology is achieved by representing the AMV motion in terms of tropospheric layers. Large volumes of multispectral (IR, VIS and WV) AMV datasets are compared to collocated rawinsonde wind profiles collected by the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program at three geographically-disparate sites: the U. S. Southern Great Plains, the North Slope of Alaska, and the Tropical Western Pacific. These comparisons reveal that RMS differences between matched AMVs and rawinsonde wind values are minimized if the rawinsonde values are averaged over specified layers. In other words, the AMV value better represents a motion over a <b>tropospheric</b> <b>layer,</b> rather than a discrete level. The layer characteristics are specifically identified according to AMV height (high-cloud vs. low-cloud), type (spectral bands, clear vs. cloudy), geo-location, height assignment method, and amount of environmental vertical wind shear present.

Considering O₃ and H₂O deviations from an automatically calculated background, we define four types of <b>layers.</b> These <b>tropospheric</b> <b>layers</b> are a common feature, with {{the percentage of the}} troposphere occupied by such layers varying from 7 % to 33 % depending on the region and the season. Most of the layers are found between 4 and 8 km altitude, and the median thickness is about 500 m. At northern midlatitudes we find 4 times more layers in summer than in winter, while in tropical Asia we observe a spring maximum in the occurrence of the layers. The most abundant layer type everywhere is O₃+H₂O− and corresponds to the signature of stratospheric intrusions or continental pollution. This suggests that stratosphere-troposphere exchanges or at least their influence are not negligible in summer at midlatitudes or in the tropics.

The altitude, vertical and optical depth at 532 nm and 355 nm of the clouds are determined from the Lidar data, as well as depolarization at these wavelengths. The clouds appear in an altitude around 16 km and are between 0. 5 and 2 km thick. The optical depth t at 532 nm lies between 0. 01 an 0. 1 with a mean value of 0. 02.

This study investigates the variability and trend of both species in three <b>tropospheric</b> <b>layers</b> above the German airports Frankfurt and Munich. About 21   300 flights have taken place over the period 1994 – 2012, which represents the worldwide densest vertical in situ data set of O 3 and CO (with [*]∼[*]  96 flights per month on average). The mean vertical profile of ozone shows a strong gradient in the first kilometre during the whole year and in the tropopause region in spring and summer. The mean vertical profile of CO is characterised by high mixing ratios at the ground, a strong decrease in the first kilometre, in particular in winter and autumn, and a moderate one in the free troposphere. O 3 minimises in November–December and shows a broad spring/summer maximum in the lower and mid-troposphere and a sharp maximum in summer in the upper troposphere. The seasonal variation of CO shows a broad minimum in July–October close to the surface and in September–October it occurs higher in the troposphere, while the maximum occurs in February–April in the whole troposphere. Over the period 1994 – 2012, O 3 has changed insignificantly (at a 95  % confidence level), except in winter where a slightly significant increase (from + 0. 83  [+ 0. 13;+ 1. 67] % yr − 1 in the LT to + 0. 62  [+ 0. 02;+ 1. 22] % yr − 1 in the UT, relative to the reference year 2000) is found.

Inside cloud layers, the RH from RUC is 2 - 14 % lower than the RH from SONDE for all RUC layers. Although the layer mean RH within clouds is much greater than the layer mean RH outside cloud or in the clear-sky, RH thresholds chosen as a function of temperature can more accurately diagnose cloud occurrence for either dataset.

Recent advances in point precipitation measurements promise to circumvent this problem. In addition, indirect estimates based upon t(h) •e atmospheric water balance equation pr vide seasonal precipitation amou ts for areas l r- ger than I xl km 2. For broad-scale studies in the continental interior net snow accumulation closely approximates precipitation. Annual precipitation is relatively high over the marginal ice slopes in relation to amounts in the interior. This meridional distribution {{is due to the}} orographic lifting of moist air by the ice sheet. Zonal precipitation variations are related to the quasi-stationary c clones in the circumpolar low-pressure trough. Most precipitation falls in winter, when the average moisture content of the air is low. The intensity of cyclonic activity is the key factor governing the amount of precipitation and its variations. Precipitation generation in coastal regions is strongly influenced by the fact that poleward moving, moist maritime air masses are deflected by the steep marginal ice slopes to blow parallel to the terrain contours. Direct orographic lifting with accompanying adiabatic ooling is the dominant precipitation formation mechanism inland of the l-kin elevation contour; intrusions of moist air far into the continent are accompanied by southerly winds through a deep <b>tropospheric</b> <b>layer.</b> Above 3000 m elevation where terrain slopes are gentle, radiative cooling is the primary mechanism by which saturation is maintained within moist air, and thus by which precipitation is formed.

As in simulation, the degradation of retrieval accuracy with increasing cloud cover is small and the RMS accuracy of lower tropospheric temperature retrieved with 80 percent cloud cover is about 0. 5 K poorer than for clear cases. HSB failed in February 2003, and consequently HSB channel radiances are not used in the results shown in this paper. The AIRS/AMSU retrieval algorithm described in this paper, called Version 4, become operational at the Goddard DAAC (Distributed Active Archive Center) in April 2003 and is being used to analyze near-real time AIRS/AMSU data. Historical AIRS/AMSU data, going backwards from March 2005 through September 2002, is also being analyzed by the DAAC using the Version 4 algorithm...|$|E
40|$|The Aerosol/Lidar Science Group of the Remote Sensing Branch {{engages in}} {{experimental}} and theoretical studies of atmospheric aerosol scattering and atmospheric dynamics, emphasizing Doppler lidar {{as a primary}} tool. Activities include field and laboratory measurement and analysis efforts by in-house personnel, coordinated with similar efforts by university and government institutional researchers. The primary focus of activities related to understanding aerosol scattering is the GLObal Backscatter Experiment (GLOBE) program. GLOBE was initiated by NASA in 1986 to support the engineering design, performance simulation, and science planning for the prospective NASA Laser Atmospheric Wind Sounder (LAWS). The most important GLOBE scientific result has been identified of a background aerosol mode with a surprisingly uniform backscatter mixing ratio (backscatter normalized by air density) throughout a deep <b>tropospheric</b> <b>layer.</b> The backscatter magnitude of the background mode evident from the MSFC CW lidar measurements is remarkably similar to that evident from ground-based backscatter profile climatologies obtained by JPL in Pasadena CA, NOAA/WPL in Boulder CO, and by the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment in the United Kingdom. Similar values for the background mode have been inferred from the conversion of in situ aerosol microphysical measurements to backscatter using Mie theory. Little seasonal or hemispheric variation {{is evident in the}} survey mission data, as opposed to large variation for clouds, aerosol plums, and the marine boundary layer. Additional features include: localized aerosol residues from dissipated clouds, occasional regions having mass concentrations of nanograms per cubic meter and very low backscatter, and aerosol plumes extending thousands of kilometers and several kilometers deep. Preliminary comparison with meteorological observations thus far indicate correlation between backscatter and water vapor under high humidity conditions. Limited intercomparisons with the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) limb extinction sounder shows differences in the troposphere, however, {{it should be noted that}} in general SAGE measurements have not yet been validated in the troposphere...|$|E
30|$|The {{troposphere}} is the lowermost {{layer of}} earth’s atmosphere extending approximately 7 to 20  km from the earth’s surface where almost all weather takes place. It carries about 75 – 80 % {{of the total}} atmospheric mass and about 99 % of the total mass of water vapor and aerosols. Hence, following ionospheric layer, the <b>tropospheric</b> <b>layer</b> has been playing a challenging role in the Communication, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS) applications by offering neutral atmospheric delays in the traversing signals (Ansari et al. 2018). In particular, the modern navigation and positioning operations through the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals suffer a considerable range delay error due the water vapor, temperature and pressure content in the troposphere which in turn degrades the positioning precision (Hadas et al. 2016). Unlike ionospheric (dispersive) delays, the tropospheric (neutral) delay in dual frequency GNSS receivers cannot be mitigated through linear combination of frequencies method (Panda and Gedam 2016). Rather, it can be mitigated through modeling the wet and dry components of the troposphere. The tropospheric delay {{is known as the}} Zenith Total Delay (ZTD) and can be distinguished into two components, namely the Zenith Wet Delay (ZWD) that corresponds to the moisture content of the atmosphere and the Zenith Hydrostatic Delay (ZHD) or Zenith Dry Delay (ZDD) caused by dry air gases in the atmosphere. The ZHD can be reasonably tackled by existing empirical model (e.g. Hopfield 1972) and analytical model (e.g. Saastamoinen 1972) etc. However, the ZWD contains large uncertainties as the water vapor of the atmosphere varies significantly in spatial as well as temporal domain. There are hardly any accurate models for the wet component. Hence, the ZWD is usually estimated as unidentified parameters (Hadas et al. 2016). Incidentally, the slant wet delay in the GNSS signals can be mapped into zenith direction by using suitable mapping functions like Niell mapping function (Niell 1996) and VMF 1 (Boehm et al. 2009) etc. In brief, the wet delay together with other unknown parameters like clock error and receiver coordinate uncertainties are estimated in the functional model following an empirical solution for the ZHD component of ZTD error.|$|E
40|$|Normal mode Rossby {{waves are}} {{simulated}} with an efficient Double Fourier Series (DFS) spectral model, and their structures are {{investigated by the}} Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis. By selecting appropriately the wave-vector component for EOF analysis among the geopotential height and velocity fields of wavenumber one, {{it was possible to}} get the EOFs from the time series data whose spatial structures closely resemble the gravest three normal-mode waves. It was found that the leading modes of EOFs showed the phase configuration that tilts northward-westward and upward-westward in the horizontal and vertical plane, respectively. This indicates, as in the previous studies, that the normal mode Rossby waves are generated by the wave source in the lower atmosphere of southern-hemisphere high-latitudes. The wave amplitude of the temperature field that was obtained from the hydrostatic equation was shown to increase with the altitude except the upper <b>tropospheric</b> <b>layers...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{primitive}} equation spectral model using spherical harmonics is formulated to study dynamic {{interactions between the}} troposphere and stratosphere in association with sudden stratospheric warmings. Using sigma coordinates for five <b>tropospheric</b> <b>layers</b> and log-pressure coordinates for 26 stratospheric and mesospheric layers, separate model equations for each system are combined to form single matrix governing equations. The gradual introduction of large scale topography to balanced initial states representative of observed mean winter conditions in the Northern Hemisphere {{is used for the}} generation of planetary waves during 40 -day time integrations. Results of these integrations indicate that stratospheric warmings can be simulated by this orographic forcing and that mean momentum flux divergence due to zonal mean motion appears to be an essential mechanism of these simulated sudden warmings. It was found that the strength of the polar night jet can be a determining factor whether a warming becomes 'major' or 'minor'...|$|R
40|$|The {{microwave}} payload of the Megha-Tropiques {{mission is}} explored {{to quantify the}} expected improvements in the retrieval of relative humidity profiles. Estimations of the profiles are performed using a generalized additive model that uses cubic smoothing splines to address the nonlinear dependencies between the brightness temperatures (TB) in the 183. 31 GHz band and the relative humidity of specified <b>tropospheric</b> <b>layers.</b> Under clear-sky and oceanic situations, the six-channel configuration of the SAPHIR radiometer clearly improves the retrieval and reduces {{by a factor of}} two the variance of the residuals with respect to the current space-borne humidity sounders that have three channels in this band (AMSU-B, MHS). Additional information from the MADRAS radiometer (at 23. 8 and 157 GHz) further improves the restitution with correlation coefficient higher than 0. 89 throughout the troposphere.
