Numerical {{results are presented}} for comparing the performance of these schemes {{on a number of}} meshes with varying degrees of skewness. It is shown that both the new continuous edge flux scheme and the existing vertex flux scheme are very stable and generate second order or nearly second order accurate results on moderately and highly skewed meshes. The other two existing schemes suffer from accuracy and stability problems on these types of meshes.

40|$|The {{body of work}} Cells {{has been}} created {{as a result of}} an ongoing {{dialogue}} since 2013, with emminent mitosis scientist Tony Hyman and the Hyman Lab, at the Max Plank Institute of Molecular Biology. In the lab, Lucy Orta observed the molecular mechanism of conserved cytoskeletal processes and back in their studio, they explored cellular communication, transformation and division, taking special interest in chromosome mis-sequencing, which leads to highly complex three-dimensional structures. As a result, she created a collection of watercolours and hand-blown glass sculptures under the <b>title</b> <b>Cells</b> Diptych, which offer a singular interpretaion of the different stages of mitosis and meiosis. The delicate polychromatic glass cells, visible through the lens of a vitrine, have been made in collaboration with glass maestros at Berengo Studio in Murano. Cells Diptych were first presented in Lens on Life, an exhibition curated by Professor Marina Wallace, which maps dialogues between artists and scientists who portray, each in their own unique way, the fundamental mechanisms of human life – mitosis...|$|R

40|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century most leading {{biologists}} believed that development and heredity were {{one and the same}} problem. Even as late as 1896, the first edition of E. B. Wilson’s famous book had the <b>title</b> The <b>cell</b> in develop-ment and inheritance, even though, {{in the absence of the}} recognition of Mendel, almost nothing was known about the mechanism of heredity. It is extremely likely that Mendel’s work was ignored for 30 years precisely because heredity was linked to development (Sandler and Sandler l 985). When his work was rediscovered at the beginning of the twentieth century, the discipline of gentics was launched. Mendel’s genius was to unravel the laws of inheritance without knowing anything about the process of development, and most geneticists followed this path thereafter. In this context, it is interesting to note tha...|$|R

25|$|A notable {{success in}} {{pioneering}} late-night broadcasting, in October 1984, Yorkshire Television began airing the cult Australian soap opera Prisoner, which originally ran from 1979 to 1986. It was eventually broadcast on all {{regions of the}} UK in differing slots, usually around 23:00 (but never before 22:30 in any region), under the <b>title</b> Prisoner: <b>Cell</b> Block H. It was probably most popular in the Midlands where Central Television consistently broadcast the serial {{three times a week}} from 1987 to 1991. Its airing in the UK was staggered, so different regions of the country saw it at a different pace. The program was immensely successful, regularly achieving 10 million viewers when all regions' ratings per episode were added together. Central bowed to fan pressure to repeat the soap, of which the first 95 episodes aired. Then, rival station Channel 5 also acquired rights to repeat the entire rerun of the program, starting in 1997. All 692 episodes have since been released on DVD in the UK.|$|R

25|$|In 1966, {{the journal}} was {{redesigned}} and relaunched {{under the new}} <b>title</b> Journal of <b>Cell</b> Science, reflecting its altered scope. It continued to be published broadly quarterly until 1969, when the frequency increased to between six and nine issues per year. In the mid-to-late 1980s, to reduce publication lead times and compete more effectively with Cell (which had been launched in 1974), The Company of Biologists moved away from Cambridge University Press and set up its own in-house typesetting and printing for its journals, by then three in number, becoming pioneers in using disks from authors. Publication frequency also increased, at first to ten issues in 1987, then monthly between 1988 and 1995, finally becoming fortnightly in December 1996.|$|R
50|$|Cell Metabolism, {{launched}} in January 2005, {{is one of}} the newer <b>titles</b> in the <b>Cell</b> Press family. The journal focuses on physiology, with an emphasis on understanding the molecular basis of how the body self-regulates in the face of change, and how disturbances in these balances can lead to disease. Advances in these fields take on a special importance given the increasing prevalence of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and related maladies ("metabolic diseases") in the developed world. Created in response to what top scientists saw as a growing need for a specialized journal in this field, Cell Metabolism is run by in-house editorial and production teams with full responsibility for selecting and preparing content for publication.|$|R

Radiocarbon dating yielded an age of 39,900 ± 620 years, which suggests these individuals belonged to the last populations of this human species in Europe. In 1997 the research team succeeded in extracting mitochondrial DNA from the humerus of the type specimen, the first sample of a Neanderthal mtDNA ever. Results, though, were interpreted very carefully in the publication of this first analysis. Nevertheless, evidence led {{to the conclusion that}} Neanderthals were genetically distinct from anatomically modern humans. The <b>title</b> of the <b>Cell</b> journal issue read: [...] "Neanderthals were not our ancestors". The decoding of the Neanderthal genome in 2010 relativized this statement, though (see section below).|$|R

40|$|Inhibition of Tyrosine Kinases (TKs) blocks {{multiple}} intracellular signaling pathways {{involved in}} tumor growth, progression and angiogenesis. Therefore, {{the development of}} small ATP-mimetic Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) resulted very attractive as anti-tumoral and anti-angiogenic tools. A major goal {{in the field of}} TKIs development is to find compounds able to inhibit more than one TK, in order to overcome the drug resistance onset. In this way, the blockade of several signaling pathways involved in tumor growth, as EGFR and VEGFR, has a strong rationale for development of multi-targeted TKIs. Several 4 -anilinoquinazolines derivatives have been synthesized. The compounds have been submitted to specific biological assay on a panel of six different TKs and on tumor cell lines. The most active compounds were submitted to other biological evaluations in order to investigate the mechanism of action. The <b>title</b> derivatives induced <b>cell</b> death through activation of the pro-apoptotic pathway. Almost all the compounds showed very interesting anti-angiogenic activity.

40|$|Small {{fragments}} {{circulating in}} the blood were formally identified {{by the end of}} the 19 th century, and it was suggested that they assisted coagulation via interactions with vessel endothelia. Wright, at the beginning of the 20 th century, identified their bone-marrow origin. For long, platelets have been considered sticky assistants of hemostasis and pollutants of blood or tissue samples; they were just cell fragments. As such however, they were acknowledged as immunizing (to specific HPA and HLA markers) : the platelet’s dark face. The enlightened face showed that besides hemostasis, platelets contained factors involved in healing. As early as the 1930 s, platelets entered the arsenal of medicines; were transfused, and were soon manipulated to become a kind of glue to repair damaged tissues. Some gladly categorized platelets as cells but they were certainly not fully licensed as such for cell physiologists. Actually, platelets possess almost every characteristic of cells, apart from being capable of organizing their genes: they have neither a nucleus nor genes. This view prevailed until it became evident that platelets play a role in homeostasis and interact with cells other than with vascular endothelial cells; then began the era of physiological and also pathological inflammation. Platelets have now entered the field of immunity as inflammatory cells. Does assistance to immune cells itself suffice to license a cell as an immune cell? Platelets prove capable of sensing different types of signals and organizing an appropriate response. Many cells can do that. However, platelets can use a complete signalosome (apart from the last transcription step, though it is likely that this step can be circumvented by retrotranscribing RNA messages). The question has also arisen as to whether platelets can present antigen via their abundantly expressed MHC class I molecules. In combination, these properties argue in favor of allowing platelets the <b>title</b> of immune <b>cells...</b>|$|R
