5|$|When Scott Rudin was {{adapting}} Wonder Boys for the screen, {{the author}} declined {{an offer to}} write the screenplay, saying {{he was too busy}} writing The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay. Directed by Curtis Hanson and starring Michael Douglas, Wonder Boys was released in 2000 to critical acclaim and financial failure. Having bought the film rights to The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, Rudin then asked Chabon <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> film's screenplay. Although Chabon spent 16 months in 2001 and 2002 working on the novel's film adaptation, the project has been mired in pre-production for years.|$|E

500|$|In a 2015 {{interview}} with The Pitchfork Review, Björk expressed frustration {{over to the}} lack of recognition for all of her work on Vespertine and her other albums. She said:I did 80% of the beats on Vespertine and it took me three years <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> album, because it was all microbeats — it was like doing a huge embroidery piece. Matmos came {{in the last two weeks}} and added percussion on top of the songs, but they didn't do any of the main parts, and they are credited everywhere as having done the whole album. [...] Drew [...] is a close friend of mine, and in every single interview he did, he corrected it. And they don't even listen to him. It really is strange.|$|E
500|$|Soule's {{greatest}} musical influences are [...] "Debussy's {{exploration of}} harmony", [...] "Wagner's grand operas", and [...] "Mozart's form and composition". While {{many of his}} orchestral works are based on movie scores in terms of scope, he does not often listen to movie scores, though he names his favorite composer as John Williams. The influence has been noted by critics, who have termed Soule [...] "the John Williams of video game music". Among video game music influences, he has cited Square for providing him [...] "with the education for what quality means to this business" [...] and Nobuo Uematsu in particular. His favorite style of music to listen to is British pop and rock music, while his favorite video games {{are the ones that}} he has written scores to, especially the ones made by Chris Taylor, though one of his all-time favorites is The Legend of Zelda. He has said that the games he would most like <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> he has not already are ones by Shigeru Miyamoto, a Final Fantasy game, and a Metroid game.|$|E
500|$|Odin Sphere Leifthrasir, {{a remake}} of Odin Sphere for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, began {{development}} in late 2013 alongside publisher Atlus changing ownership from Index Corporation to Sega. Ohnishi acted as the remake's director, while Kamitani produced. Atlus initially {{wanted to create a}} followup to Vanillaware's recent successful title Dragon's Crown, but when Odin Sphere came up in conversations, it was decided <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> as it was both Vanillaware's first project and their first Atlus-published title. Initially planned to be an upgraded port, the availability of development resources allowed {{for the development of a}} full remake. The aim by Vanillware was to keep the well-received story and visual design intact, while improving the RPG elements and ironing out technical issues that were criticized at the time. The game's title Leifthrasir was in reference to Líf and Lífþrasir, the two humans in Norse mythology who survive Ragnarok and repopulate the new world. The [...] "Leifthrasir" [...] spelling was chosen over the more common [...] "Lifthrasir" [...] as the former sounded better. It was also written with the Old Norse letter [...] "þ" [...] incorporated into the title.|$|E

He continued <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> and its 1950 successor magazine, PS, The Preventive Maintenance Monthly until 1971. Eisner also illustrated an official Army pamphlet in 1968 and 1969 called The M16A1 Rifle specifically for troops in Vietnam to help minimize the M-16 rifle's notorious early reliability problems with proper maintenance. Eisner's style helped to popularize these officially-distributed works {{in order to better}} educate soldiers on equipment maintenance.|$|E
2500|$|Developers {{also found}} the machine {{difficult}} to program for. In 2007, Gabe Newell of Valve said [...] "The PS3 is a total disaster on so many levels, I think it's really clear that Sony lost track of what customers and what developers wanted". He continued [...] "I'd say, even at this late date, they should just cancel it and do a do over. Just say, 'This was a horrible disaster and we're sorry and we're going to stop selling this and stop trying to convince people to develop for it'". Doug Lombardi VP of Marketing for Valve has since stated that Valve is interested in developing for the console and is looking to hire talented PS3 programmers for future projects. He later restated Valve's position, [...] "Until {{we have the ability}} to get a PS3 team together, until we find the people who want to come to Valve or who are at Valve who want <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>that,</b> I don't really see us moving to that platform". At Sony's E3 2010 press conference, Newell made a live appearance to recant his previous statements, citing Sony's move to make the system more developer friendly, and to announce that Valve would be developing Portal 2 for the system. He also claimed that the inclusion of Steamworks (Valve's system to automatically update their software independently) would help to make the PS3 version of Portal 2 the best console version on the market.|$|E

Yes; 'twas that the Dagoes shipped for, and 'twas that the filibusterin' Clancy signed for, though unbeknownst to himself at the time. In after days I found out about it. It seems 'twas hard to get hands <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> road. The intelligent natives {{of the country was}} too lazy to work. Indeed, the saints know, 'twas unnecessary. By stretchin' out one hand, they could seize the most delicate and costly fruits of the earth, and, by stretchin' out the other, they could sleep {{for days at a time}} without hearin' a seven-o'clock whistle or the footsteps of the rent man upon the stairs. So, regular, the steamers travelled to the United States to seduce labour. Usually the imported spade-slingers died in two or three months from eatin' the over-ripe water and breathin' the violent tropical scenery. Wherefore they made them sign contracts for a year, when they hired them, and put an armed guard over the poor divils to keep them from runnin' away.|$|E
