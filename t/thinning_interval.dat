Records from 5, 629 crossbred Angus x Zebu animals born between 1995 and 2004 were used. Univariate and bivariate analyses of the traits were performed using an animal model and Bayesian inference. The effects included in the model were contemporary group, individual heterozygosis, age of animal at recording, and random direct genetic effect of the animal and residual. The size of the chain requested, as well as the burn-in period and <b>thinning</b> <b>interval,</b> was sufficient to obtain convergence of the posterior estimates of the genetic parameters. The heritability estimates obtained in univariate and bivariate analysis were 0. 38 and 0. 30 for W 365 and 0. 32 and 0. 30 for W 550, respectively. The genetic correlation between traits was 0. 98. Comparison of the rank of the 10 best sires based on the breeding values for W 365 and W 550 showed a small difference between the traits studied. The effect of heterozygosity has importance for crossings and for obtaining higher postweaning weights, indicating that the use of animals with maximum individual heterozygosity is advantageous.

Thinning treatments ranged from unthinned control, to light and moderate repeated thinnings, to a treatmentwhere 60 - 70 % of the basal area was removed in a single thinning. In addition, thinning from above was compared tothinning from below and delayed first thinning was compared to early first thinning. The average measurement period was 31 years for Scots pine and 30 years for Norway spruce. All Scots pine thinning treatments reduced the total gross stemvolume production compared to the unthinned control, whereas only the heaviest thinning treatments, in which a largeproportion of the basal area was removed, reduced the total gross stem volume production for Norway spruce. Thinningfrom above did not affect total gross stem volume production of Scots pine, but there was a tendency towards lowerproduction in Norway spruce.

The present study shows that storm-generated depositional processes governed sedimentation in a muddy shelf environment. The studied sequence is dominated by blackish mudshale and silt-streaked mudshale with <b>thinner</b> <b>intervals</b> of pale, fine-grained heterolithic sandstone. It represents the Lower Jurassic Fjerritslev Formation {{in the eastern part}} of the Danish Basin and has been studied in four cores from the Stenlille 1 well. Within the muddy outer shelf association four sedimentary facies and 14 types of laminae, 0. 5 - 10 mm thick, may be distinguished. Most of the laminae share the characteristics of graded bedding, erosive bases and occasional fading ripples with storm layers of sand grade. The structures indicate that the mudshale laminae formed by settling of the suspension load carried by storm-generated currents. This kind of episodic deposition of fine-grained storm layers may be common, though rarely preserved, in outer shelf environments. In many recent studies of shelf sediments, relatively thin sand layers with erosive bases and graded bedding have been interpreted as storm-sand layers (Haye...|$|R

Their unusual facies, stratigraphically abrupt basal and upper contacts, and strongly negative carbon isotopic signature (δ 13 C values between ∼ 0 ‰ and − 5 ‰) suggest a chemical oceanographic origin, the details of which remain unresolved. Here we propose that these enigmatic deposits are related to the destabilization of gas hydrate in terrestrial permafrost following rapid postglacial warming and flooding of widely exposed continental shelves and interior basins. Supporting evidence for this hypothesis includes (1) the common occurrence within the cap carbonates of unusual fabrics, similar to those produced by cold methane seeps; (2) a distinctive time evolution for the carbon isotopic excursions indicative of a pulse addition of isotopically depleted carbon to the ocean- atmosphere system; and (3) agreement between mass-balance estimates of carbon released by hydrate destabilization and carbon buried in the cap carbonate.

This study was mainly conducted to understand the influences of these canopy gaps on the local microclimate in the windbreak belt, by the multi-layer anemometer, instruments of microclimate, and TDR (Time-Domain-Reflectometry) soil moisture observations. The {{results of this study}} may be useful for coast windbreak management. The results indicated that the soils in the forest zone of Taichung harbor is sand with extremely low organic matter content. This is unfavorable to grow and sprout in forest. The bulk density and particle density of soils in each canopy gaps are between 1. 44 ～ 1. 48 g/cm 3 and 2. 28 ～ 2. 46 g/cm 3 respectively and have no conspicuous difference. The average porosity of the soils is 38 % in the experimental areas. Casuarina trees have good salinity tolerance, and the electrical conductivity experiment shows that the soil salinity level is low. As a result, it has small influences on growing of Casuarina trees. Moreover, the smaller canopy gap is, the smaller air temperature difference is, but the relative humidity is higher (more than 78 %). The atmospheric pressure and soil moisture have little difference in different canopy gaps of forest. The soil moisture in the fully stocked forest land, forest land with a small and medium canopy gap is 0. 4 % higher then it in forest land with a large canopy gap and the check plot. The daily sunshine duration, radiation, illumination, evaporation, and soil temperature appeared to positively related to canopy gaps. The average height of Casuarina trees in the study area lies between 10 ～ 13 m, and the height of cone lies between 7 ～ 9 m approximately. Most seeds can float 10. 8 ～ 17. 2 m by wind, a few can float even farther.

40|$|Nuclear waste {{emplacement}} in devitrified volcanic tuff at Yucca Mountain {{will raise the}} temperature of surrounding rock for a geologically significant period of time. This study evaluates the susceptibility of an underlying 50 -ft-thick vitrophyre to thermal alteration by examining alteration that occured in the rock as it cooled after deposition. A 10 {sup 0 }C temperature rise should have no mineralogical effects on the vitrophyre, but an increase of 60 {sup 0 } or more is {{likely to result in}} alteration. Expected mineralogic changes in the vitrophyre caused by this amount of thermal loading include crystallization of zeolites and smectite. Alteration will be concentrated of zeolites and smectite. Alteration will be concentrated in a <b>thin</b> <b>interval</b> {{near the top of the}} vitrophyre and along fractures. Adsorbed water and water in preexisting hydrous minerals and in glass may contribute to hydrothermal alteration of underlying vitrophyre. Bulk porosity change would be slight and local porosity increase would probably be restricted to the upper part of the vitrophyre. Although some fracture filling could occur, such a minor sealing effect would be balanced by development of secondary porosity. Zeolites and smectite, newly-crystallized along fluid flow paths below the waste repository, could provide an enhanced sorptive barrier to radionuclide migration. 21 references, 3 figures...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{economically}} optimal management, {{trees that}} are removed in a thinning treatment should be selected {{on the basis}} of their value, relative value increment and the effect of removal on the growth of remaining trees. Large valuable trees with decreased value increment should be removed, especially when they overtop smaller trees. Methods: This study optimized the tree selection rule in the thinning treatments of continuous cover management when the aim is to maximize the profitability of forest management. The weights of three criteria (stem value, relative value increment and effect of removal on the competition of remaining trees) were optimized together with <b>thinning</b> <b>intervals.</b> Results and conclusions: The results confirmed the hypothesis that optimal thinning involves removing predominantly large trees. Increasing stumpage value, decreasing relative value increment, and increasing competitive influence increased the likelihood that removal is optimal decision. However, if the spatial distribution of trees is irregular, it is optimal to leave large trees in sparse places and remove somewhat smaller trees from dense places. However, the benefit of optimal thinning, as compared to diameter limit cutting is not usually large in pure one-species stands. On the contrary, removing the smallest trees from the stand may lead to significant (30 – 40...|$|R
40|$|The Triassic-Jurassic {{boundary}} marks {{one of the}} "big five " mass extinctions in {{the last}} half billion years. In many of the exposed rift basins of the Atlantic passive margin of eastern North America and Morocco, the boundary is identified as an interval of stratigraphically abrupt floral and faunal change within cyclical lacustrine sequences. A comparatively <b>thin</b> <b>interval</b> of Jurassic age strata separate the boundary from extensive overlying basalt flows, the "best " dates of which (~ 202 Ma) are practically indistinguishable from recent dates on tuffs from marine Triassic-Jurassic boundary sequences. The pattern and magnitude of the Triassic-Jurassic boundary at many sections spanning more than 10 ° of paleolatitude in eastern North America and Morocco is remarkably similar to that at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, sparking much debate on the cause of the end-Triassic extinctions with hypotheses focusing on bolide impacts and climatic changes associated with flood basalt volcanism. Four prior attempts at finding evidence of impacts at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary in these rift basin localities, were unsuccessful. However, based on much more detailed geochemical and mineralogical sampling of four tightly biostratigraphically-constrained sections in the Newark rift basin (NY, NJ, PA: USA), {{we have been able to}} identify a modest Ir anomaly (up to 285 ppt, 0. 29 ng/g) measured by gammagamm...|$|R
40|$|The lateral {{relationships}} among the San Adrián, Canalón and Olaja members of {{the upper part of}} the Alba Fm. are discussed. These rocks are considered to be parts of a carbonate ramp developed from latest Viséan or early Pendleian to middle Arnsbergian times. The new name Millaró Beds is proposed herein for a <b>thin</b> <b>interval</b> of marine beds with middle-upper Arnsbergian ammonoids and conodonts, and laterally equivalent to part of the Olaja Mb. The Millaró Beds constitute {{the upper part of the}} Alba Fm. providing an additional criterion for the identification of the boundary between the Alba and Barcaliente formations at many sections across the Cantabrian Mountains. These beds represent sedimentation in a starved basin and a transgresive event at the beginning of the Variscan foredeep formation. This basin was subsequently filled by the siliciclastic rocks of the Cuevas Fm. and the marginal carbonates of the Barcaliente Fm. The review of both published and new conodont data are applied to the recognition of different stages around the Mississippian/Pennsylvanian boundary. Finally, the distribution of conodont genera in the upper Arnsbergian to Kinderscoutian Barcaliente Fm is also given.

40|$|Recent {{detailed}} {{studies of}} the physical, bio-, and chemostratigraphy of upper Llandovery to middle Wenlock strata of the Cincinnati Arch area, primarily SW Ohio and SE Indiana {{and to a lesser}} extent west-central Kentucky, indicate a regionally extensive pattern of units, correlatable in detail over more than 30, 000 sq. km. This relatively simple stratigraphy has been obscured by the development of local names and by different usage of the same name in different areas. Herein we review and update this stratigraphical succession to provide uniform nomenclature and correlation of these units throughout the study area. The units as redefined and/or extended in this study include the Lee Creek, Dayton, Osgood, Lewisburg, Massie, and Laurel formations. Extension of the unit name Salamonie Dolomite is herein discouraged south of the Salamonie type area in NE Indiana. The term Dayton Dolostone is herein redefined; it is overlain by the Osgood Formation, which is also redefined here as equivalent to Foerste’s (1897) ‘Lower Osgood Clay’. The Lewisburg Limestone/Dolostone is reintroduced here as a formal name at the rank of formation to include a <b>thin</b> <b>interval</b> of pelmatozoan-brachiopod dolomitic pack- to grainstone formerly termed ‘Middle Osgood Limestone’ in Indiana and ‘Laurel of Ohio’ (in part) in SW Ohio.

40|$|The thick upper Pliocene {{to lower}} Pleistocene {{succession}} of hemipelagic mudstones of the Marche Apennines foredeep (central Italy) is punctuated by several mostly coarse-grained, cyclic turbidite systems. Integrated and detailed analyses of sedimentary facies, physical stratigraphy, biostratigraphy, and magnetostratigraphy {{have provided a}} high-resolution sequence stratigraphic framework for sediments of two of these coarse-grained systems, each resulting from the stack of five deepwater, high-frequency depositional sequences backfilling the mouth and lower reaches of a long-lived submarine canyon. The tight chronostratigraphic control available on these two turbidite systems and encasing hemipelagic sediments allows a precise correlation of the component high-frequency sequences with the Pliocene marine oxygen isotope curve. This reveals that the cyclic arrangement occurred near the Gauss–Matuyama polarity transition and {{the onset of the}} Olduvai subchron in response to recurring, obliquity-driven global changes in sea level. Each depositional sequence, 20 to 65 m thick, includes sediments that were deposited by a range of gravity-driven processes, resulting in sedimentary motifs that contain a deep marine record of both glacial and interglacial stages. A typical depositional sequence comprises: (1) a lowstand systems tract composed of cohesionless-debris-flow conglomerates (braided submarine channel complex), which passes down-dip into turbidite sandstones (frontal-splay complex); (2) an overlying transgressive to early falling-stage systems tract composed of a mud-rich masstransport complex of slumped horizons and cohesive-mud-flow pebbly mudstones eventually overlain by a <b>thin</b> <b>interval</b> of hemipelagic mudstones. This stacking pattern records variations in depositional style, and hence, variations in canyon activity during eustatic changes in sea level...|$|R

40|$|Palaeontological events, {{documented}} by widespread beds or <b>thin</b> <b>intervals</b> of strata with either unusual (“exotic”) or acmes of common faunal elements are a characteristic feature of Upper Cretaceous epicontinental shelf sediments in NW Europe. Their importance in stratigraphic calibration has early been recognized and these “bioevents ” {{are widely used}} as correlation tools. Furthermore, it appears {{that there is a}} genetic link between sequence and event stratigraphy as most of the “classic” bioevents developed during specific intervals of a 3 rd−order depositional sequence. Early transgressive bioevents (ETBs) are subdivided into two subtypes, i. e., the lag and migration subtype. The lag subtype corresponds to the transgressive surface and develops in response to winnowing and relative enrichment of robust biogenic hardparts. Taphonomic alteration and time−averaging are important features. The migration subtype is related to the disappearance of physical or ecological barri− ers that triggered faunal migrations. Despite their onlapping character, most ETBs are quasi−isochronous, and their preserva− tion potential is usually high. Thus, they are very useful stratigraphic markers. Maximum flooding bioevents (MFBs) repre− sent autochthonous biogenic concentrations with relatively low shell densities. They are related to habitat stability and ecospace expansion, and develop by population blooms of taxa well adapted to the special maximum flooding conditions of the wide epicontinental shelf of NW Europe (e. g., low food availability). Cenomanian MFBs of NW Europe are not time−av− eraged and may comprise stratigraphically more expanded intervals with gradational lower and upper boundaries. Their of− ten wide palaeogeographic extent associated with very high chances of preservation results in an excellent inter−basinal cor...|$|R

However, after more detailed sampling, a modest Ir anomaly has been reported (up to 285 ppt, 0. 29 ng/g) in the Newark rift basin (New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, United States), and this anomaly is directly associated with a fern spike. A search for shocked quartz in these rift basins has thus far been fruitless.
