There simply is not enough salve to heal the wounds of war. Heaven knows we try. Indeed, war reparations are on the make in the twenty- first century: we enthusiastically embrace mechanisms for Holocaust reparations, Gulf War reparations, Yugoslav reparations, and Ethiopian and Eritrean reparations. But beneath the veneer, it is clear that no effective remedy exists to respond to the horror of war. Like many others, I have spent much of my career working to redress the consequences of wars and revolutions: first, at the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal as a legal advisor; second, in private practice representing claimants before the United Nations Compensation Commission; third, as a senior legal advisor for the Claims Resolution Tribunal resolving claims to Holocaust-era dormant Swiss bank accounts; and most recently, advising clients regarding prisoner-of-war claims againstJapanese corporations arising out of the Second World War.

40|$|Auckland is a city-region {{under intense}} {{political}} pressure. Migration and development are transforming streetscapes and communities. Local {{government has to}} plan and budget for significant investments in infrastructure as the city grows, {{and there is no}} strategy that pleases all sectors of residents at once. Property owners love their rising asset wealth, but central government is under pressure to address homelessness and home affordability. The Reserve Bank and the Treasury, moreover, watch Auckland’s over-heated housing market nervously, as it poses risk to the whole economy (Makhlouf, 2016). In the midst of this, a major restructuring of Auckland’s local governance and administration has been undertaken. The formation of the Auckland Council in 2010 unified four metropolitan city councils, two and a half district councils and one regional council, comprising a large urban, rural and marine area (encompassing 4, 894 sq km of land and 3, 702 km of coastline and embracing 30 % of New Zealand’s population). This new entity was popularly dubbed the Super City, somewhat misleadingly given that, in terms of area, the new authority is mainly rural, although its population is mainly urban-dwelling. Being formally named Auckland’s basic problem is one that many other regions would love to have: growth. But <b>then,</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> manage it? Its population was 1, 415, 550 in the 2013 census, and is predicted conservatively to reach 2 million by 2033. ‘Threefifths of New Zealand’s population growth between 2013 and 2043 will be in Auckland’ (Statistics New Zealand, 2015). Is Auckland Council now simply too big to be efficient, democratic and sustainable? Will it be branded ‘a failed experiment’? Once the unitary spatial plan has been approved and put in place, will the next step be to devolve powers to, say, ten or 12 smaller councils? Empirical evidence and public sentiment weigh against Auckland’s unified governance model. Aucklanders disapprove of it; the rest of New Zealand refuses to emulate it. This particular pendulum may have further to swing towards centralisation (meaning central government takes over some powers to shape Auckland), or it may have reached its extreme position and be on the cusp of swinging back towards a devolved model (multiple boroughs under a regional council). In the meantime, the council has to earn a better reputation with the people of Auckland, improve local engagement and participation, implement the new unitary plan and ensure financial sustainability. Its longterm fate rests in the balance...|$|E

40|$|Recycling wastes Cue: Organic {{production}} of {{crops and livestock}} demands {{a high level of}} skill, knowledge and organisation. Systems for recycling waste animal and plant products can be complex, and farmers also need to be imaginative, to find the best ways of using their waste resources. The Songhay centre in Benin is one example where farmers have managed to find some amazing methods of organic farming. The centre was set up in 1985 and since then has been developing its system of organic agriculture, while also training young people in the methods and even running a popular restaurant, where the organic produce are enjoyed by visitors from the nearby city of Porto Novo. In this report Tunde Fatunde talks to Eric Dandjihoun, a trainee at the centre, about the methods they are using. Eric dreams of establishing his own mini-centre {{at the end of his}} training. Tunde began by asking him why the centre was established. IN:		?Well the purpose of establishing ?? OUT:		?? in here to eat the food. ? DUR?N	 3 ? 32 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Tunde Fatunde reporting from the Songhay centre in Benin. The centre has been so successful that it is now being replicated in other towns in Benin and Nigeria. Transcript Dandjihoun	Well the purpose of establishing the Songhay Centre is to promote agriculture the natural way. That is producing crops and animals without chemical components. Fatunde	In this centre you people rear pigs, snails, pigeons, ducks and fowls. You have a very big fish pond. How do you feed all these animals? Dandjihoun	First of all, let me tell you we have our own animal feed mill here, where we compound maize, pumpkernal cake and other materials. After compounding this maize and other materials, we now mix this with wheat residue, which is found from the breweries, and use this to feed the animals. And also we use nature, that is plants, to feed these animals as well. Fatunde	Don?t you add some chemicals when you feed your fishes in your fish pond? Dandjihoun	Not at all, not at all. Fatunde	<b>Then</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> feed your fish? Dandjihoun	You see in this Songhay centre, we do research. And our finding is one of these. Fishes are fed with maggots. How do we obtain these maggots? We rear maggots as well. Maggots are obtained from wheat residue or malt residue, mixed with pig droppings, and other wastes. This is done for about three days, after which the maggots are produced. Then we gather these maggots and mix them with malt residue dried in the sun to feed these fishes. Fatunde	The Songhay centre is also involved in crop production. What are these crops? Dandjihoun	Carrots, cabbage, beetroot, beans, cucumber, parsley, onions, I mean mention it! Even sweetcorn. Fatunde	Ah ha! Which simply shows that if you produce all these, at a point you use fertilisers. Dandjihoun	Oh no, no, no, no, no! Songhay centre is against the usage of chemical fertilisers. So what we use basically is compost, and this compost is a product from animal waste, plant waste, kitchen waste and all these. We gather these things together in a very cool place for about three months, turning it after every fifteen days. Then we apply them on our crop production parcels, and then we produce our crops. You see that it is natural. Fatunde	It is also very interesting that your source of energy is from gas. How do you produce this gas? Dandjihoun	Yes, this gas is produced by water hyacinth. You know many people do not know the value of this water hyacinth. We use this same water hyacinth in feeding pigs, and at the same time we get this waste from the pigs, and mix this with the same water hyacinth, and stock in a place built with concrete. And after some days, the gas is generated. That is the gas we use. Fatunde	It is interesting to note here that there is an outfit where people come in here to eat, every day, from morning till evening. Dandjihoun	Yes, that is to tell you that people are aware of their health. They know that food cooked in Songhay centre is got from natural sources. That?s why you see a lot of people come in here to eat the food. End of track. A trainee at the Songhay Centre in Benin describes a very innovative mixed crop and livestock system of organic production...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Fundamental {{approaches}} {{bypass the}} problem of getting consciousness from non-conscious components by positing that consciousness is a universal primitive. For example, the double aspect theory of information holds that information has a phenomenal aspect. <b>How</b> <b>then</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> get from phenomenal information to human consciousness? This paper proposes that an entity is conscious to the extent it amplifies information, first by trapping and integrating it through closure, and second by maintaining dynamics {{at the edge of}} chaos through simultaneous processes of divergence and convergence. The origin of life through autocatalytic closure, and the origin of an interconnected worldview through conceptual closure, induced phase transitions in the degree to which information, and thus consciousness, is locally amplified. Divergence and convergence of cognitive information may involve phenomena observed in light e. g. focusing, interference, and resonance. By making information flow inward- biased, closure shields us from external consciousness; thus the paucity of consciousness may be an illusion...|$|R

The authors’ research with 46 companies points to a solution: After meeting the customer’s basic specs within an acceptable price range, give the purchasing manager "a justifier"—an extra that provides obvious value to the business. A car-leasing company, for instance, might offer the option to cancel a number of contracts without penalty, or a delivery service might print customers’ logos on their envelopes. The justifier provides a clear-cut reason to select one supplier over others and breaks the tie among the finalists on the short list. To uncover justifiers, you should explore how customers use your offerings, learn about their priorities and those of their customers, and look at ways to integrate your offerings with other suppliers’.
