25|$|For much of {{the rest}} of his tenure of the Staffordshire seat, Littleton was either in default or on sick leave. He was {{considered}} still 'friendly' to the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, but was unable <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> On his death in 1812, his nephew Edward Walhouse replaced him as MP, soon after changing his name to Littleton. He was a very different MP from the 4th Baronet: urbane, studious, a master of political detail and a determined debater, he first joined the Canningite Tories, but later became a Whig.|$|E
500|$|Two {{days after}} the election, Prime Minister Janša {{announced}} that he might resign following {{what was perceived as}} a heavy defeat for the Government: [...] "We will analyze the situation further, but all possibilities are open, including a resignation of the Government." [...] He said that [...] "it is particularly worrying that a lot of energy was invested in blackening the Government abroad", claiming his opponents portrayed Slovenia [...] "as Belarus" [...] or some other authoritarian country. The opposition parties said that talk of resignation just weeks before Slovenia took over European Union presidency was irresponsible and unwise, but the Prime Minister called a vote of confidence for 19 November 2007. The Government won the confidence vote, but support for the ruling SDS subsequently reached an all-time low, with only 18% of voters intending <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> in the fall 2008 election.|$|E
500|$|Although he {{supported}} a general amnesty for former Confederates, Blaine opposed extending it to include Jefferson Davis, and he cooperated with Grant {{in helping to}} pass the Civil Rights Act of 1875 in response to increased violence and disenfranchisement {{of blacks in the}} South. He refrained from voting on the anti-third term resolution that overwhelmingly passed the House that same year, believing that <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> would look self-interested. Blaine was loyal to Grant, and the scandals of the Grant administration did not seem to affect how the public perceived him; according to his biographer, Blaine was never more popular than when he was Speaker of the House. Liberal Republicans saw him as an alternative to [...] the evident corruption of other Republican leaders, and some even urged him to form a new, reformist party. Although he remained a Republican, this base of moderate reformers remained loyal to Blaine and became known as the Half Breed faction of the party.|$|E
2500|$|According to Ezra Klein of The Washington Post, {{the list}} of HAA Republican {{supporters}} is deceptive: [...] "The plan {{has a lot more}} fake support than it has real support.

[...] Nevertheless, numerous Senate Republicans reiterated their support for Wyden-Bennett in a 2009 op-ed.|$|R

2500|$|When {{the film}} was released, it {{garnered}} three separate Academy Award nominations for Best Original Song for [...] "Belle", [...] "Be Our Guest" [...] and [...] "Beauty and the Beast". Producer Don Hahn expressed concern that this would cause confusion among audiences and voters, and potentially result in an unfavorable tie. In order to prevent this from happening, the studio fought {{in favor of the}} film's title song and decided to release a pop rendition of [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] as a commercial single in an attempt to persuade voters <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> When [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] was written, it was composed with the potential of having [...] "half a life outside the movie."

2500|$|DeLay {{was known}} to [...] "primary" [...] Republicans who {{resisted}} his votes (i.e., to threaten to endorse and to support a Republican primary challenge to the disobedient representative), and, {{like many of his}} predecessors in Congress, used promises of future committee chairmanships to bargain for support among the [...] members of the party. Employing a method known as [...] "catch and release", DeLay allowed centrist or moderately conservative Republicans to take turns voting against controversial bills. If a representative said that a bill was unpopular in his district, then DeLay would ask him <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> only if his vote were necessary for passage; if his vote were not needed, then the representative would be able to vote against the party without reprisal, a practice which has been followed by other party leaders and whips {{from both sides of the}} aisle, Democrat and Republican, respectively, when in power.|$|E
2500|$|PR {{tries to}} resolve the {{unfairness}} of majoritarian and plurality voting systems where the largest parties receive an [...] "unfair" [...] "seat bonus" [...] and smaller parties are disadvantaged and have difficulty winning any representation at all (Duverger's law). The established parties in UK elections can win formal control of the parliament with as little as 35% of votes (2005 UK general election). In certain Canadian elections, majority governments have been formed by parties {{with the support of}} under 40% of votes cast (2011 Canadian election, 2015 Canadian election). If turnout levels in the electorate are less than 60%, such outcomes allow a party to form a majority government by convincing as few as one quarter of the electorate <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> [...] In the 2005 UK election, for example, the Labour Party under Tony Blair won a comfortable parliamentary majority with the votes of only 21.6% of the total electorate. [...] Such misrepresentation has been criticized as [...] "no longer a question of 'fairness' but of elementary rights of citizens". [...] However, PR systems with a high electoral threshold, or other features that reduce proportionality, are not necessarily much fairer: in the Turkish general election, 2002, using an open list system with a 10% threshold, 46% of votes were wasted.|$|E

For my own part I firmly believe that had my advice been taken we should have routed the Zulus. Seventeen desperate white men, armed with guns, would have produced no small effect upon a camp of sleeping savages. But it was not taken, so it is no use talking about it.|$|E
6000|$|In 1784, {{three years}} before the Constitution, the United States then owning the Northwestern Territory, and no other, the Congress of the Confederation had before them the {{question}} of prohibiting slavery in that Territory; and four of the [...] "thirty-nine" [...] who afterward framed the Constitution were in that Congress, and voted on that question. Of these, Roger Sherman, Thomas Mifflin, and Hugh Williamson voted for the prohibition, thus showing that, in their understanding, no line dividing local from Federal authority, nor anything else, properly forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in Federal territory. The other of the four--James McHenry--voted against the prohibition, showing that for some cause he thought it improper <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 3. This blunder of Mr. Disraeli (from which, {{greatly to}} his credit, Sir John Pakington took an {{opportunity}} soon after of separating himself) is a speaking instance, among many, how little the Conservative leaders understand Conservative principles. Without presuming to require from political parties such {{an amount of}} virtue and discernment as that they should comprehend, and know when to apply, the principles of their opponents, we may yet say {{that it would be}} a great improvement if each party understood and acted upon its own. Well would it be for England if Conservatives voted consistently for every thing conservative, and Liberals for every thing liberal. We should not then have to wait long for things which, like the present and many other great measures, are eminently both the one and the other. The Conservatives, as being by the law of their existence the stupidest party, have much the greatest sins of this description to answer for; and it is a melancholy truth, that if any measure were proposed on any subject truly, largely, and far-sightedly conservative, even if Liberals were willing <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> the great bulk of the Conservative party would rush blindly in and prevent it from being carried.|$|E
