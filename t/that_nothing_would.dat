25|$|According to Polish {{historian}} Piotr Łossowski, {{the method}} used {{in most of the}} attacks was the same. At first, local Poles were assured <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>would</b> happen to them. Then, at dawn, a village was surrounded by armed members of UPA, behind whom were peasants with axes, hammers, knives, and saws. All the Poles encountered were murdered; sometimes they were herded into one spot, to make it easier. After a massacre, all goods were looted, including clothes, grain, and furniture. The final part of an attack was setting fire to the village. In many cases, victims were tortured and their bodies mutilated. All vestiges of Polish existence eradicated with even abandoned Polish settlements burned to the ground.|$|E
25|$|An {{eyewitness}} who {{was injured}} called Shaker Mohammed Abdulhussain told Al Wasat that police cars were parked near Salmaniya Medical Complex gates where the funeral {{was supposed to}} move out from. To prevent clashes between mourners and riot police, mourners formed a human chain in which Shaker {{was standing next to}} Al-Matrook. There were two people speaking to riot police telling them that the youth will ensure <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>would</b> go wrong. Then a man wearing full black came from outside the funeral and threw a stone at riot police, who then started firing rubber bullets and bird pellet gunshot indiscriminately. While Shaker and Al-Matrook were trying to help a man who was injured by rubber bullets to his leg, they were shot with bird pellet gunshot. Shaker was injured in his chest and other parts in the body, while Al-Matrook was injured in his back and died in the hospital.|$|E
25|$|This 1st Battle of Doiran (second battle by Bulgarian reckoning) {{had been}} a failure, and with many troops being {{withdrawn}} to other theatres, Wilson and XII Corps did not get another opportunity to launch a major attack until 18 September 1918. On that day, with two brigades of 22nd Division and the Greek Seres Division, XII Corps failed to take ‘Pip Ridge’ and the ‘Grande Couronne’. Again Wilson advised Milne against an immediate resumption of the attack. The following day he attacked with a brigade from 27th Division supported by the remnants of 22nd Division, the Seres Division, and the French 2nd Regiment of Zouaves. Once more the attack failed with heavy casualties, and at 11.00 Wilson informed Milne <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>would</b> be gained by continuing the fight. However, the 2nd Battle of Doiran had served its purpose by drawing Bulgarian attention away from Gen Franchet d’Esperey’s main Franco-Serbian thrust, which broke through the Bulgarian lines further west. On 21 September the downcast men of the BSF were stunned to be ordered to pursue the retreating Bulgarians, with XII Corps in the lead. Bulgaria signed an armistice with the Allies on 29 September, but the BSF continued to advance across Bulgaria towards the Turkish frontier, until the Ottoman Turks also signed the Armistice of Mudros on 31 October.|$|E

25|$|Some Xing Yi {{practitioners}} {{also use}} the five elements as an interpretative framework for reacting and responding to attacks. This follows the five element theory, a general combat formula which assumes two types of cyclic interactions and three types of adverse interactions. The two cyclic interactions are the mutual nourishment (constructive) and mutual restraint (destructive) cycles. The adverse reactions are lesser known and rarely trained but exist from the understanding <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>would</b> exist if the mutual nourishment and restraint cycles existed alone, the adverse reactions are mutual over-restraint (overwhelming destructive interation), mutual reverse restraint (reversal of the destructive cycle), and mutual burdening (unbalancing or reversal of the constructive cycle). Practitioners abiding by these concepts train to react to and execute specific techniques {{in such a way}} that a desirable cycle will form based on these interactions of the five element theory. Where to aim, where to hit and with what technique—and how those motions should work defensively, is determined by what point of which cycle they see themselves in. Each of the elements has many variant applications that allow it to be used to defend against all of the elements (including itself), so any set sequences are ultimately entirely arbitrary in real combat but present a frame work for developing a more practical skill, the destructive cycle is often taught to 'beginners' as it is generally easier to visualize and consists of easier applications.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} transfer, Grant began his {{campaign}} to capture Vicksburg and open the Mississippi River. After the initial failure of his traditional overland approach, he devised several plans aimed at bypassing the fixed defenses of the city. One of these {{became known as the}} Steele's Bayou Expedition. Mound City, now commanded by Lieutenant Commander Byron Wilson, {{was a member of a}} flotilla that attempted to reach the Yazoo River through a web of bayous, sloughs, creeks, and rivers. Porter himself accompanied the expedition and made the important decisions. Progress was slow because of the tight turns in the narrow streams, the trees that overhung the channels, and willow roots that clung to the hulls of the vessels as they attempted to pass; they were brought to a complete halt by Confederate soldiers who felled trees in the intended path. Unable to dislodge the enemy, Porter ordered a retreat, but then found that a party of Rebels had circled behind him and were cutting him off. Porter sent an immediate appeal for help to Grant, and then had his subordinates prepare to destroy their vessels rather than let them fall into enemy hands. The appeal was passed on to Major General William T. Sherman, commanding the Fifteenth Army Corps and already in the vicinity. He ordered two of his regiments forward immediately, and they met up with Porter's flotilla on the afternoon of 21 March. Sherman himself accompanied a larger body of troops that arrived in the enemy's rear the next day. The surprised Confederate soldiers immediately fled. Although the expedition was no longer opposed by the Rebels, Porter and Sherman concluded <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>would</b> be gained by resuming the advance. Accordingly, the retreat continued, and the flotilla was back on the Mississippi on 27 March.|$|E

As far as the sound was concerned, Justin Speer of GameSpot opined that the music appropriately matched the rich visuals. Brogger otherwise accepted the sound as [...] "enough [...] to get by", but <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>would</b> be missed if it were turned off. Harris comparably stated that [...] "the standard Japanese tunage could {{have been given a}} bit more variety". The reviewers gave mixed opinions of the game's storyline. Though Brogger called it [...] "engrossing", Harris recognized the plot as the game's one major fault, describing it as [...] "kiddy" [...] and disliking the consistent use of computer terminology for character names. Speer similarly summarized, [...] "If there's something that might hold you back from enjoying the game, it's the lighthearted and somewhat goofy story.
