5000|$|Bipack {{photography}} was, {{from about}} 1935 to 1950, the most economical means of 35 mm natural color cinematography available, used when color was wanted but the budget {{could not bear}} the much higher cost of three-strip Technicolor or the less well-known alternative <b>three-color</b> <b>processes</b> sometimes available outside the US. After 1950, when economical [...] "monopack" [...] color negative and print stocks such as Eastmancolor and Ansco Color were introduced, the use of bipack photography and printing rapidly declined. By 1955 all two-color motion picture processes were commercially extinct in the US.|$|R
50|$|Kenneth Macgowan (November 30, 1888 - April 27, 1963) was an American film producer. He won an Academy Award for Best Color Short Film for La Cucaracha (1934), {{the first}} live-action short film {{made in the}} <b>three-color</b> Technicolor <b>process.</b>|$|R
50|$|While Paramount {{was a large}} {{organization}} with a network of theaters, its fiscal consciousness was largely responsible for preventing Fleischer Studios from acquiring the three-color Technicolor Process, leaving it available for a four year exclusivity with Walt Disney, who created a new market for color cartoons, established by Academy Award winner, Flowers and Trees (1932).Paramount relinquished {{to the release of}} the Color Classics series starting in 1934. But with the exclusivity of the <b>three-color</b> <b>process</b> still held by Disney, Fleischer Studios used the available two-color processes, Cinecolor, a two-emulsion red and blue process, and Two-color Technicolor, using red and green. By 1936, the Disney exclusivity was expired, and Fleischer Studios used the <b>three-color</b> <b>process</b> in its color cartoons beginning with Somewhere in Dreamland and continued using it for the remainder of its active years.|$|E
50|$|The same year, Gundelfinger also {{developed}} a <b>three-color</b> <b>process</b> called SuperCinecolor, but did not begin using it until 1951 with The Sword of Monte Cristo. Other films of note that used the SuperCinecolor process were Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd (1952), Jack and the Beanstalk (1952), Invaders From Mars (1953), Gog (1954), and Top Banana (1954). The latter two were both also filmed in 3-D.|$|E
50|$|Technicolor re-emerged as a <b>three-color</b> <b>process</b> for {{cartoons}} in 1932 {{and live}} action in 1934. Using a different arrangement of a beam-splitter cube and color filters behind the lens, the camera simultaneously exposed three individual strips of black-and-white film, each one recording {{one-third of the}} spectrum, which allowed virtually the entire spectrum of colors to be reproduced. A printing matrix with a hardened gelatin relief image was made from each negative, and the three matrices transferred color dyes into a blank film to create the print.|$|E
50|$|Moving to California in 1924 and {{graduating in}} 1931 as a chemist from the California Institute of Technology, Hoch was a {{research}} physicist who joined the Technicolor company in 1934.

50|$|After {{the market}} crash, Muray {{turned away from}} celebrity and {{theatrical}} portraiture, and become a pioneering commercial photographer, famous for his creation {{of many of the}} conventions of color advertising.

50|$|As {{founding}} member of The Society of Motion Picture Engineers, Max {{was aware of the}} technical advancements of the industry, particularly in the development of color cinematography. Due to Paramount's financial restructuring, Max was unable to acquire the <b>three-color</b> Technicolor <b>process</b> from the start. This created the opportunity for Walt Disney, who was then a small fledgling producer to acquire a four-year exclusivity. With this, he created a new market for color cartoons beginning with Flowers and Trees (1932). In 1934 Paramount approved color production for Fleischer, but he was left with the limited two-color processes of Cinecolor (red and blue) and Two-Color Technicolor (red and green) for the first year of his Color Classics. The first entry, Poor Cinderella was made in the two-emulsion/two color Cinecolor Process and starred Betty Boop in her only color appearance. By 1936, Disney's exclusivity had expired, and Fleischer had the benefit of the <b>three-color</b> Technicolor <b>Process</b> beginning with Play Safe.|$|R
5000|$|MGM, however, was {{the very}} last studio to convert to [...] "talkies" [...] with its first all-color, [...] "all-talking" [...] sound feature with {{dialogue}} The Rogue Song, a 1930 musical. In 1934, MGM included a sequence made in Technicolor's superior new <b>three-color</b> <b>process,</b> a musical number in the otherwise black-and-white The Cat and the Fiddle, starring Jeanette MacDonald and Ramon Novarro. The studio then produced a number of three-color short subjects including 1935's musical La Fiesta de Santa Barbara, but waited until 1938 to film a complete feature in the process, Sweethearts with MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, the earlier of the popular singing team's two films in color. From then on, MGM regularly produced several films a year in Technicolor with Northwest Passage {{being one of the}} most notable.|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} color motion picture film {{is linked to}} two companies: Technicolor and Eastman Kodak. Technicolor was formed in 1915 by Herbert Kalmus, Daniel Comstock, and W. Burton Wescott, who {{realized}} that color film could enhance motion picture entertainment. Introduced in 1932, it was a <b>three-color</b> <b>process</b> that was widely used into the late 1950 s. The <b>three-color</b> <b>process</b> utilized a camera with one lens that exposed three black and white negatives simultaneously by splitting the incoming visible light through a prism. The prism would create two beams of light which would then expose one film negative to green light {{and the rest of}} the split light exposed a red and blue bi-pack comprised of two film negatives placed emulsion to emulsion. 1 One film negative would be sensitized to blue light while the other to red light, once exposed, the two negatives would be separated to be processed. The Eastman Color process, developed by Eastman Kodak Company in 1950, was similar to Technicolor. Eastman Color used three light-sensitive emulsions that were sensitized to red, green, and blue light which were then coated onto a single film base. 2 Having all three emulsion layers on one film support does away with the bulky <b>three-color</b> <b>process</b> camera used in the Technicolor process. Eastman Color prints were less costly to produce than Technicolor prints. This was because Eastman Color only used one film negative versus Technicolors three. Within a decade, Eastman Color films began to show evidence of fading in the negatives and prints. The film industrys shift from Technicolor to Eastman Color film resulted in a shift in the color, tone, and color balance of the film prints. Technicolor three-color dye process produces a very stable color 1 Scott Higgins, 2 ̆ 2 Demonstrating Three-Colour Technicolor: 2 ̆ 2 Early Three-Colour Aesthetics and Design, 2 ̆ 2 Film History 12, 4 (2000) : 358 - 383. 2 ̆ 2 22 ̆ 2 Doug Nishimura, Email correspondence with author, June 3, 2015. 2 ̆ 2 22 ̆ 2 that doesnt easily degrade with hues that were “warm,” 2 ̆ 2 whereas Eastman Color tended to be “cooler” 2 ̆ 2 and almost neon-like. In this thesis, I will discuss the differences in dyes used by Technicolor and Kodak and illustrate how the dyes have altered over time. To do so, I have made measurements on dyed film test strips by using a spectrophotometer that was created specifically for this testing. I sampled twenty-five test dyed film strips and twenty-five Technicolor film reels. In addition, a single Eastman Color film reel was tested. This sample size of fifty-one items yielded raw data that was calculated into absorbance and transmittance wavelengths. These spectral curves allow for comparison between the dyes used and for an evaluation of the colors. In the discussion, I describe why knowledge of dye fading is important to museums and how spectral information on dyes could improve film preservation efforts. This data is analyzed by reviewing scholarly journals, case studies, and first-hand accounts of dye tests in an effort to further the knowledge for museums and professionals with a focus on information on motion picture film, preservation, and spectrophotometry...|$|E
25|$|In 1933, MacDonald left {{again for}} Europe and while there, signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Her first MGM film was The Cat and the Fiddle (1934), {{based on the}} Jerome Kern Broadway hit. Her co-star was Ramón Novarro. The plot about {{unmarried}} lovers shacking up just barely slipped through the new Production Code guidelines that took effect July 1, 1934. Despite a Technicolor finale—the first use of the new <b>three-color</b> Technicolor <b>process</b> other than Disney cartoons—the film was not a huge success.|$|R
5000|$|The first Polacolor was a post-World War II {{process for}} making 35mm color motion picture prints for {{theatrical}} use. It was a <b>three-color</b> dye coupler <b>process</b> that produced full-color images {{in a single}} photographic emulsion. As {{an alternative to the}} dominant Technicolor printing process, Polacolor had advantages over the contemporary Cinecolor process, which yielded two-color prints that reproduced only a limited range of colors and had the two component dye images in separate emulsions on the front and back of the film base.|$|R
40|$|A new medium-bright quasar sample (MBQS) is {{constructed}} from spectroscopic observations of 140 bright objects selected for {{varying degrees of}} blue and ultraviolet excess (B-UVX) in five Palomar 1. 2 m Schmidt fields. The MBQS contains 32 quasars with B less than 17. 65 mag. The new integral surface densities in the B range from 16. 45 to 17. 65 mag are approximately 40 percent (or more) higher than expected. The MBQS and its redshift distribution increase {{the area of the}} Hubble diagram covered by complete samples of quasars. The general spectroscopic results indicate that the <b>three-color</b> classification <b>process</b> used to catalog the spectroscopic candidates (1) has efficiently separated the intrinsically B-UVX stellar objects from the Population II subdwarfs and (2) has produced samples of B-UVX objects which are more complete than samples selected by (U - B) color alone...|$|R

Full-color tomographic imaging is also possible by processing the three-color channels of the interference images. A technique is described to obtain two-dimensional OCT images with full natural color representation. In a particular embodiment, the interference image is acquired using a color camera and the <b>three-color</b> channels are <b>processed</b> separately, recomposing the final image. In an additional embodiment, the interference images are acquired using separate red, blue and green light sources and the three color channels are combined to recompose the final image...|$|R
50|$|The {{anthology}} featured heroic {{fiction and}} genre stories, primarily fantasy and science fiction, {{but in a}} broad range of styles. Established mainstream-comics talents such as John Buscema, Jim Starlin, John Byrne, and Terry Austin were featured, as well as independent-press creators as Wendy Pini and The Studio's Jeffrey Jones, Michael Kaluta, Barry Windsor-Smith, and Bernie Wrightson. Goodwin commissioned stories by many new artists, including Stephen R. Bissette, Pepe Moreno, Jon J Muth, Rick Veitch and Kent Williams. The full-color magazine format, allowed for a broader range of color than the traditional <b>three-color</b> printing <b>process,</b> and many of the stories, and all the covers, were painted. Fantasy artists who did not normally work in the comics field, such as Richard Corben, Frank Frazetta, The Brothers Hildebrandt, and Boris Vallejo contributed covers. The contributors to the series retained ownership of their material and were paid royalties. Epic Illustrated also included an occasional Marvel Comics protagonist, such as the first issue's Silver Surfer story by Stan Lee and John Buscema. Each issue usually featured a main story, a number of regular serials, and anthological shorts.|$|R
5000|$|In 1707 Le Blon {{issued a}} short {{publication}} in Dutch on {{the forms of}} the human body.5 In 1708 and 1709 he {{is known to have}} made colorant mixing experiments in Amsterdam and in 1710 he made his first color prints with yellow, red, and blue plates.2 While in Amsterdam he became acquainted with Arnold Houbraken, who quoted him as a source of information on German painters for his Schouburg, later published after Houbraken's death in 1718. Le Blon's wife died in 1716 and in 1717 he moved to London where he received royal patents for the <b>three-color</b> printing <b>process</b> and a <b>three-color</b> tapestry weaving <b>process.</b> The tapestry process involved using white, yellow, red, blue, and black fibers to create images.3 The printing process involved using three different intaglio plates, inked in different colours. In 1722 he published a small book, Coloritto, in French and English.6 In it he stated that “Painting can represent all visible objects with three colors, yellow, red, and blue” (pp. 6, 7). During his stay in England he produced several dozen of three- and four-colored images in multiple copies that initially sold well in England and on the continent. In the long run his enterprise did not succeed, however, and Le Blon left England in 1735, moving to Paris where he continued producing prints by his method. During his last years several sequences of prints were produced and sold showing the different steps of his printing process, such as a portrait of the French Cardinal de Fleury.7 In 1740 he began work on a collection of anatomical prints for which he had a solid list of subscribers. When he died in 1741 in Paris he left a 4½ year-old daughter, Margueritte, as sole heir.1 A detailed description of Le Blon’s work was published in 1756 by Antoine Gautier de Montdorge who befriended him during his final years in Paris.8 ...|$|R
5000|$|When Harman and Ising left Warner Bros., in 1933, {{they took}} {{with them all}} rights to the {{characters}} they had created. Leon Schlesinger had to negotiate with them to keep {{the rights to the}} name Merrie Melodies, {{as well as for the}} right to use the slogan, So Long Folks, at the end of the cartoons. In 1934, Schlesinger produced his first color Merrie Melodies shorts, Honeymoon Hotel and Beauty and the Beast, which were produced in two-strip Cinecolor (Disney then had exclusive animation rights to the richer three-strip Technicolor process). Their success convinced Schlesinger to produce all future Merrie Melodies shorts in color, using two-strip Technicolor. Looney Tunes continued in black and white until 1943. In 1936, the cartoons began to end with the slogan [...] "That's all Folks!" [...] which had previously only been used on the Looney Tunes series. The old slogan [...] "So Long, Folks!" [...] was completely abandoned at this time. The same year, Merrie Melodies began using the bulls-eye opening and closing title sequences (in 1942, Looney Tunes would use the same titles, usually in thicker rings). Also by 1936, Disney's exclusivity on the <b>three-color</b> Technicolor <b>process</b> was lifted, allowing Merrie Melodies a full color palette for the first time, hence the use of the blue concentric rings (as a technical test) for the rest of the 1935 - 36 season and the 1936 - 37 season. The Warner Bros. shield was later that year changed to cyan before definitely changing back to red in 1938.Contractually, Merrie Melodies cartoons were obligated to include at least one full chorus from a Warner Bros. song. Warner Bros. requested that these songs be performed by name bands whenever possible, but this lasted only through the first few shorts. The policy annoyed the animators of Merrie Melodies, since the songs often interrupted the cartoons' momentum and pacing (the 1938 Merrie Melodie A Feud There Was, for example, sarcastically uses the obligatory musical number as a shift in the action, with the lead characters singing the number into a KFWB microphone and ceding the mike to an announcer who reads a commercial). By 1939, the animators had been released from this obligation, and the Merrie Melodies shorts came to resemble more closely the black-and-white Looney Tunes series. In addition, several new characters were created to (initially) appear exclusively in the Merrie Melodies series, such as Egghead (who became Elmer Fudd), Inki, Sniffles and even Warner Bros.' most popular cartoon star; Bugs Bunny.|$|R
