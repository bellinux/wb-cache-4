5|$|One Canadian auto {{trail was}} routed through the UP as well. In 1920, the King's International Highway linked Vancouver, British Columbia, to Halifax, Nova Scotia, {{but there was}} no highway to carry it around the north side of Lake Superior. Motorists had to ship their cars by boat between Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, and Thunder Bay or enter the United States to {{continue}} along <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> trail. The routings varied on the maps of the time, but its basic route used US2 through the UP from Ironwood to Sault Ste. Marie until a highway north of Lake Superior was opened in 1960; by that time, <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> trail had taken on the Trans-Canada Highway name.|$|E
5|$|To {{stem the}} loss of {{passengers}} and resulting deficits, the B in the early 1960s offered reduced mid-week fares, auto shipment for passengers (similar in concept to <b>the</b> <b>Auto</b> Train), and onboard movies, to attract more passengers. The train was marginally profitable, when mail and express revenue was included.|$|E

5|$|In 2016, the {{sections}} of I-94 from the Indiana state line to the M-63 interchange was designated {{as part of the}} West Michigan Pike Pure Michigan Byway.

Entering the elevator with Irene, the Driver encounters the hit man. He then kisses Irene, and brutally beats the hit man to death. Afterwards, Irene leaves the elevator stunned and horrified.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{formation}} of the United States Numbered Highways, the U.S. relied on an informal network of roads, organized by various competing interests, collectively called <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> trail system. The surveyors of most trails chose either South Pass in Wyoming or a southern route through New Mexico to traverse the Rocky Mountains. Both options were less formidable than the higher mountain passes in Colorado, but left the state without a transcontinental artery. When the planners of the Lincoln Highway also decided to cross the Rockies in Wyoming, officials pressed for a loop to branch from the main route in Nebraska, enter Colorado, and return to the main route in Wyoming. While the Lincoln Highway was briefly routed this way, the loop proved impractical and was soon removed.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} time, the Italian Grand Prix {{was held at}} the Livorno Circuit rather than the {{traditional}} venue of Monza. Caracciola took pole position, and despite two false starts caused by spectators pouring onto the track, held his lead {{for the majority of the}} race and won from his teammate Lang by just 0.4seconds. In doing so Caracciola clinched the European Championship for the second time. He backed up the win with another at the Masaryk Grand Prix two weeks later. He trailed Rosemeyer for much of the race until <b>the</b> <b>Auto</b> Union skidded against a kerb and allowed the Mercedes into the lead.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, GCC {{assembled}} {{an advisory}} committee of scientific and technical experts to compile an internal-only, 17-page report on climate science entitled Predicting Future Climate Change: A Primer, which said: “The scientific basis for the Greenhouse Effect and {{the potential impact of}} human emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2 on climate is well established and cannot be denied.” In early 1996, GCC's operating committee asked the advisory committee to redact the sections that rebutted contrarian arguments, and accepted the report and distributed it to members.

Hornish drove seven {{races in the}} No. 54, also driving the No. 20 Camry at Michigan (where he finished second). In the No. 54, he started on the pole at Talladega and Mid-Ohio. The highlight of Hornish's season was his victory in the Get To Know Newton 250 at Iowa Speedway, where he started in second place and led for 167 laps. Despite his limited schedule he finished 27th with 242 points, the highest-ranked driver with less than ten starts. Gibbs tapped Hornish to drive <b>the</b> <b>Auto</b> Club 400 at Auto Club Speedway in the No. 11 Camry when regular driver Denny Hamlin was sidelined by a severe sinus infection, and he finished 17th.|$|E
5|$|Monster re-entered <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> audio {{market in}} the early 1990s with {{a new line of}} speaker cables and its first speaker product, the Persona One. Its {{high-end}} M-series product line was introduced in 1992. It also expanded internationally, especially in Asia. Monster had a Taiwanese distributor file its trademark in the region, which led to the distributor continuing to sell products under the Monster brand after their agreement with Monster was terminated. This led to a lengthy legal battle and eventually a settlement. Monster acquired the Entec in-car audio brand in 1998.|$|E
5|$|More people {{joined the}} middle class in the 1950s, with more money to spend, and the {{availability}} of consumer goods expanded along with the economy, including the automobile. Americans were spending more time in their automobiles and viewing them as an extension of their identity, which helped to fuel a boom in automobile sales. Most businesses directly or indirectly related to <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> industry saw tremendous growth during the decade. New designs and innovations appealed to a generation tuned into fashion and glamour, and the new-found freedom and way of life in the suburbs had several unforeseen consequences for the inner cities. The 1950s saw the beginning of white flight and urban sprawl, driven by increasing automobile ownership. Many local and national transportation laws encouraged suburbanization, which in time ended up damaging the cities economically.|$|E
