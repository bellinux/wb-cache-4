The Japanese attempted to outflank A Company on its left, but ran into Capitan L. Snell's D Company, 2/15th Infantry Battalion.|$|E
5|$|Her next {{role was}} not as helpful to her career. She {{appeared}} in the 1950 musical comedy Dance Me a Song, which <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> flop, though it was choreographed by Agnes de Mille, who had won acclaim for Oklahoma! a few years earlier. As one of the play's principal stars, she appeared in several scenes, but the choreography was ravaged by critics, as was the play, and reviews of her performance were mixed.|$|E

5|$|Originally called Capsule Monsters, the game's title {{went through}} several {{transitions}} due to trademark difficulties, becoming CapuMon and KapuMon before eventually settling upon Pocket Monsters. Tajiri {{always thought that}} Nintendo would reject his game, as the company did not really understand the concept at first. However, the games <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> complete success, something Tajiri and Nintendo never expected, especially because of the declining popularity of the Game Boy. Upon hearing of the Pokémon concept, Miyamoto suggested creating multiple cartridges with different Pokémon in each, noting it would assist the trading aspect.|$|E
5|$|The 2010–11 NBA season started {{badly for}} the Rockets, who lost {{the first five}} games. In the seventh, Yao Ming injured his left ankle in what was just his fifth game that season.

5|$|The {{expedition}} {{was composed}} of 20 warships, 21 frigates, and 32 transport ships, containing 800 cannons, 3,000 soldiers, and 10,000 marines. The expedition was to retake Louisbourg and then Annapolis Royal.

5|$|The undercard {{included}} {{a match for}} the WWF Intercontinental Championship between Diesel and Razor Ramon, which Ramon won to regain the title.

5|$|As a {{relatively}} rural environment {{in an increasingly}} urbanised area, Kersal Moor was also used for more peaceful pursuits. During the 18th and 19th centuries it was much frequented by amateur naturalists and botanists. One of the botanists was Richard Buxton {{who went on to}} write A Botanical Guide to Manchester. In 1829 an amateur insect collector named Robert Cribb collected a series of about fifty small yellow and brown moths from a rotting alder on the moor. These <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> previously unknown species of moth, but they were mistakenly attributed to a friend of Cribb's, the collector R. Wood, who had asked an expert to identify them. The moths were classified as Pancalia woodiella (today Euclemensia woodiella) in Wood's honour.|$|E

5|$|At first, {{the forests}} of the {{watershed}} were not significantly affected, but after logging operations sprung up near {{the start of the}} 20th century, most of the virgin timber in the watershed was cleared. The first sawmills were built to provide lumber for local uses, such as building houses and barns. Soon, however, the Washington, Idaho and Montana Railway extended its tracks into the area, allowing lumber to be exported out of the basin. Logging <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> very profitable industry but had a lasting negative effect on the ecology of the Potlatch River watershed.|$|E
5|$|Hennessey {{was drafted}} by the San Francisco Giants {{in the first round}} (21st overall) of the 2001 Major League Baseball draft. He began his career with the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes of the Single-A short season Northwest League, where he had a 10 record, a 2.38 ERA, 22 strikeouts, and 34 innings pitched in nine starts. That year, Salem-Keizer won the Northwest League championship. While {{pitching}} in an instructional league later that year, Hennessey began experiencing soreness that was initially attributed to a muscle strain but <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> non-cancerous tumor in his back. He had it removed in February 2002, but it grew back later that season, and he missed the entire year while undergoing a second surgery.|$|E

50|$|The design also <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unsatisfactory.

Since Poole's symptoms were intermittent, Triton continued south, {{although there was}} a detour to the Golfo Nuevo region when the ship investigated an unknown sonar contact.

5|$|Many {{paintings}} can {{be found}} in the museums of Europe depicting tulips with attractive coloured stripes. Most, such as the still life studies of Johannes Bosschaert, were painted during the 17th century. These flowers were particularly popular and became sought after by those who could afford them. At the peak of this tulip mania in the 1630s, one bulb could cost as much as a house. It was not known at the time that the stripes were caused by a virus accidentally transferred by humans to tulips from jasmine. Weakened by the virus, the plants <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> poor investment. Only a few bulbs produced flowers with the attractive characteristics of their parent plants.|$|E
