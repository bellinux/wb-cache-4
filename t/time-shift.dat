500|$|An {{important}} sequence {{within the}} episode was the <b>time-shift</b> which ends in Tommy returning to 1918.

Anthony Lewis described the wind machine used as [...] "the biggest wind machine I've {{ever seen in my}} life". [...] He comments that the intensity of the wind machine and the lighting enabled an [...] "instant-made reaction" [...] from himself and Mori. Goddard added that his first assistant director was [...] "instrumental in gearing up all the extras into a frenzy". The episode's soundtrack included the song [...] "One of These Mornings" [...] by Moby, which featured the vocals of Patti Labelle, from his 2002 album, 18.

2500|$|Streaming {{media is}} the {{real-time}} delivery of digital media {{for the immediate}} consumption or enjoyment by end users. Many radio and television broadcasters provide Internet feeds of their live audio and video productions. They may also allow <b>time-shift</b> viewing or listening such as Preview, Classic Clips and Listen Again features. These providers have been joined by a range of pure Internet [...] "broadcasters" [...] who never had on-air licenses. This means that an Internet-connected device, such as a computer or something more specific, {{can be used to}} access on-line media {{in much the same way}} as was previously possible only with a television or radio receiver. The range of available types of content is much wider, from specialized technical webcasts to on-demand popular multimedia services. Podcasting is a variation on this theme, where– usually audio– material is downloaded and played back on a computer or shifted to a portable media player to be listened to on the move. These techniques using simple equipment allow anybody, with little censorship or licensing control, to broadcast audio-visual material worldwide.|$|E

In this paper, we investigate the impact of pilot contamination and other interference, namely data to pilot interference, {{on the performance of}} finite massive MIMO systems with synchronized and unsynchronized pilots. Two unsynchronized pilot schemes are considered. The first is based on an existing <b>time-shifted</b> pilot scheme, where pilots overlap with down-link data from nearby cells. The second <b>time-shifted</b> method overlaps pilots with uplink data from nearby cells. Results show that if there are small numbers of users, the first <b>time-shifted</b> method provides the best sum rate performance. However, for higher numbers of users, the second <b>time-shifted</b> method has advantage compared to other methods. We also show that time-synchronized pilot is not necessarily the worst case scenario in term of sum rate performance when shadowing effect are considered...|$|R

40|$|Khateeb,Emad:Dining with {{a remote}} person {{requires}} that both participants {{are available at}} the same time to eat together. Because of time-zone differences and other such contingent factors, this condition can often be hard to fulfill. One solution may lie in <b>time-shifted</b> communication. A person can enjoy a meal while watching an earlier recorded video of a remote person’s dining. However, in a <b>time-shifted</b> environment, achieving dining synchronization is a challenge. In this research, we propose a <b>time-shifted</b> tele-dining system (KIZUNA) enabling people to enjoy a meal together in a virtual environment. The system adapts the displayed video’s playback speed to the difference in dining progress between the local and remote person. This is likely to enhance communication and increase enjoyment while dining. A validation experiment revealed that the proposed KIZUNA adaptation method enhanced diners’ communication behavior, and significantly enhanced the perceived presence of the remote person, in comparison with conventional <b>time-shifted</b> tele-dining. This result suggests a promising future for the KIZUNA system...|$|R
