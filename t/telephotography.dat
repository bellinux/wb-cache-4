50|$|Arthur Korn (May 20, 1870, Breslau, Germany - December 21/December 22, 1945, Jersey City, New Jersey) was a German physicist, {{mathematician}} and inventor.

5000|$|Frederic Eugene Ives (February 17, 1856 - May 27, 1937) was a U.S. inventor, born at Litchfield, Connecticut. In 1874-78 he had {{charge of}} the {{photographic}} laboratory at Cornell University. He moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where in 1885 {{he was one of}} the founding members of the Photographic Society of Philadelphia. [...] He was awarded the Franklin Institute's Elliott Cresson Medal in 1893, the Edward Longstreth Medal in 1903, and the John Scott Medal in 1887, 1890, 1904 and 1906. His son Herbert E. Ives was a pioneer of television and <b>telephotography,</b> including color facsimile.|$|E
5000|$|He also {{developed}} a method of computing depth of field from a camera's entrance pupil location and diameter, without reference to focal length and f-number (see his 1904 and 1906 books). He says, [...] "At this point it will be sufficient to note that all these formulae involve quantities relating exclusively to the entrance-pupil and its position {{with respect to the}} object-point, whereas the focal length of the transforming system does not enter into them." [...] T. R. Dallmeyer refers to Von Rohr’s [...] "interpretation" [...] of depth of field in his 1899 book <b>Telephotography.</b>|$|E

50|$|Leica {{offered a}} wide range of accessories. For instance, LTM (screwmount) lenses were easily usable on M cameras via an adapter. Similarly Visoflex lenses could be used on the Leicaflex and R cameras with an adapter. Furthermore, certain LTM and M {{rangefinder}} lenses featured removable optical groups that could mount via adapters on the Visoflex system, thus making them usable as rangefinder or SLR lenses for Visoflex-equipped Screwmount and M rangefinder cameras, as well as being usable on Leicaflex and R cameras. Leica also offered focusing systems, such as the Focorapid and Televit, that could replace certain lenses’ helicoid mounts for sports and natural-life <b>telephotography.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some common {{features}} of 35mm SLR photography were first {{seen on the}} Topcon RE Super. Among these is the through-the-lens exposure metering. This enabled improved exposure accuracy, especially in close-up macro photography using bellows or extension rings, and in <b>telephotography</b> with long lenses. In addition to this feature, the metering is at full aperture. For this purpose the RE-lensese have an aperture simulator that relays the preset aperture to the exposure meter at full aperture, retaining a bright viewfinder image while determining the correct exposure, avoiding the stop-down method. The meter also works independently of the pentaprism finder, which allows for different viewfinder configurations. The meter cell is actually incorporated in the camera's reflex finder mirror. This was accomplished by milling narrow slits in the mirror surface letting {{a fraction of the}} light through to the CdS cell placed just behind it.|$|E
5000|$|Moore's inventions at General Electric {{included}} a miniature neon lamp that remained {{a fixture in}} electronic displays throughout the twentieth century, and was a forerunner of plasma displays. Both the lamp and his further inventions were also important to the early development of television. In particular, around 1917 Moore developed a [...] "negative glow" [...] neon lamp. These were miniature lamps with a very different design than the much larger neon tubes used for neon lighting; a Smithsonian Institution website notes, [...] "These small, low power devices use a physical principle called [...] "coronal discharge." [...] Moore mounted two electrodes close together in a bulb and added neon or argon gas. The electrodes would glow brightly in red or blue, depending on the gas, and the lamps lasted for years. Since the electrodes could take almost any shape imaginable, a popular application has been fanciful decorative lamps. Glow lamps found practical use as indicators in instrument panels and in many home appliances until the acceptance of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in the 1970s." [...] In 1924 he invented the vacuum bulbs used in <b>telephotography,</b> and in 1925 improved it for use in television.|$|E
40|$|Taken from up {{to forty}} miles away, Trevor Paglen's limit <b>telephotography</b> images of covert {{military}} bases in the American Southwest are blurred by dense atmopshere, dust and debris. In effect, his photographs are highly illegible, and thus the military bases escape any sort of revelation. Following this logic, if one cannot see these top secret locations, then these images are in fact not politically effective at disclosing confidential federal information. Rather, Paglen asserts that the political agency of his can be located not in the image, but {{in the practice of}} performing limit <b>telephotography</b> - standing on public land and excercising the right to photograph. In turn, Paglen relocates the documentarian potential of his images into an agency formulated by a relational aesthetic, one in which the communal effects of creating the image and interpreting it generate the possibilities of enacting further practices of political resistance...|$|E
40|$|Visual communication, in {{the form}} of <b>telephotography</b> and television, for example, can be {{regarded}} as efficient only if the amount of information that it conveys about the scene to the observer approaches the maximum possible and the associated cost approaches the minimum possible. Elsewhere we have addressed the problem of assessing the end to end performance of visual communication systems in terms of their efficiency in this sense by integrating the critical limiting factors that constrain image gathering into classical communications theory. We use this approach to assess the electro-optical design of image gathering devices {{as a function of the}} f number and apodization of the objective lens and the aperture size and sampling geometry of the phot-detection mechanism. Results show that an image gathering device that is designed to optimize information capacity performs similarly to the human eye. For both, the performance approaches the maximum possible, in terms of the efficiency with which the acquired information can be transmitted as decorrelated data, and the fidelity, sharpness, and clearity with which fine detail can be restored...|$|E
