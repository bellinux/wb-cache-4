5|$|During the 19th century, the Inns {{began to}} stagnate; little {{had been changed}} since the 17th century in terms of legal {{education}} or practice, except that students were no longer bound to take the Anglican sacrament before their call to <b>the</b> <b>Bar.</b> In 1852 the Council of Legal Education was established by the Inns, and in 1872 a formal examination for the call to <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> was introduced. Gray's Inn itself suffered more than most; as in the 18th century, the fortunes of its members declined, and many barristers who had been called to <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> at the Inn transferred to others.|$|E
5|$|Gray's Inn and {{the other}} three Inns of Court remain the only bodies legally allowed to call a {{barrister}} to <b>the</b> <b>Bar,</b> allowing him or her to practise in England and Wales. Although the Inn was previously a disciplinary and teaching body, these functions are now shared between the four Inns, with <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> Standards Board (a division of the General Council of <b>the</b> <b>Bar)</b> acting as a disciplinary body and the Inns of Court and Bar Educational Trust providing education. The Inn remains a collegiate self-governing, unincorporated association of its members, providing within its precincts library, dining, residential and office accommodation (chambers), along with a chapel. Members of <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> from other Inns may use these facilities to some extent.|$|E

5|$|Gray's Inn's {{internal}} records {{date from}} 1569, {{at which point}} there were four types of member; {{those who had not}} yet been called to <b>the</b> <b>Bar,</b> Utter Barristers, Ancients and Readers.

At the time Gray's Inn was the odd one out amongst the Inns; the others did not recognise Ancients as a degree of barrister and had Benchers roughly corresponding to the Readers used at Gray's Inn (although the positions were not identical).|$|E

5|$|Although it had {{abandoned}} the cause of Poniatowski's reforms, the Familia did not receive the support it expected from the Russians, who continued to press for the dissidents' rights. Meanwhile, some factions now rallied {{under the banner of}} <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> Confederation, aimed against the dissidents, Poniatowski and the Russians. After an unsuccessful attempt to find allies in Western Europe (France, England and Austria), Poniatowski and the Familia {{had no choice but to}} rely more heavily on the Russian Empire, which treated Poland as a protectorate. In the War of <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> Confederation (1768–1772), Poniatowski supported the Russian army's repression of <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> Confederation.

The following year, he was kidnapped by Bar Confederate sympathizers and briefly held prisoner outside of Warsaw, but managed to escape.

This equalled the record three {{consecutive}} League titles held by Huddersfield Town and Arsenal. Ian Rush top scored with 32 league goals and 13 in other competitions. The 1984 Football League Cup Final win was their fourth in a row. Everton were beaten by a solitary Souness goal in a replay at Maine Road after a 0–0 at Wembley Stadium In the 1984 European Cup Final they faced A.S. Roma at Roma's Stadio Olimpico.

50|$|In the 1970s {{the logging}} of old-growth forests accelerated, {{and the numbers}} of the {{northern}} spotted owl began to decline. Beginning in 1912 <b>the</b> <b>barred</b> owl began expanding its range westward and northward. Once considered an East Coast resident, <b>the</b> <b>barred</b> owl moved into the Rocky Mountains and southern Canada, into the spotted owl's territory. <b>The</b> <b>barred</b> owl is extremely adaptable, whereas the northern spotted owl is much more stagnate. <b>The</b> <b>barred</b> owl can live in virtually any forest and eat almost anything. The northern owl is adapted to best survive in old growth forest and relies mainly on the flying squirrel as a food resource. Much like human counterparts, as <b>the</b> <b>barred</b> owl expanded westward these larger more adaptable birds forced native owls, such as the northern owl, off their territory. <b>The</b> <b>barred</b> owl is about 20% larger and will feast on flying squirrels out of convenience. Biologists have noted a severe decline in the breeding population of northern owls, whereas <b>the</b> <b>barred</b> owl populations thrive (Levy, 2004).|$|R

5|$|In 1733 the {{requirements}} for a call to <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> were significantly revised in a joint meeting between the Benchers of Inner Temple and Gray's Inn, revisions accepted by Lincoln's Inn and Middle Temple, although they were not represented.
