5|$|A royal hunting park {{close to}} Melbourne was {{probably}} created by King John around 1200, and the King {{is known to}} have stayed at the manor house on at least five occasions. John gave the manor and its lands to Hugh Beauchamp, although they appear to have soon reverted to the crown, being gifted by Henry III to Bishop Walter Mauclerk of Carlisle in about 1230. The estate returned to the crown on the bishop's death in 1248, and Henry granted the land to his son, Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster, in 1265. At some later date, the manor appears to have been granted to a Philip Marc, before passing to Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, the King's son. This was in 1298 when he came of age, his father having died two years earlier. Early references to the house itself are rare, but there are records of repairs to <b>the</b> <b>gutters</b> in 1246 and to the roof of the King's Chamber in 1248.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 300 {{households}} {{were members}} by 2006, {{and in the}} same year, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation awarded the synagogue a grant of $350,000 for exterior restoration of the sanctuary. The grant was part of a million-dollar capital campaign that the membership intended to carry out in 2008, as the synagogue building still required extensive repairs: the roof leaked, causing interior damage, and (along with <b>the</b> <b>gutters)</b> needed to be replaced; interior columns were taped to prevent plaster from falling off them; the sanctuary doors needed to be replaced; and the stained glass windows needed to be removed, the metal holding them repaired, and their wooden framing replaced. In 2007 the New York Landmarks Conservancy's Sacred Sites Program awarded Baith Israel Anshei Emes grants totaling $17,500, for copper roof and masonry restoration.|$|E
25|$|By the 16th century, cesspits and cesspools were {{increasingly}} {{dug into the}} ground near houses in Europe {{as a means of}} collecting waste, as urban populations grew and street gutters became blocked with the larger volume of human waste. Rain was no longer sufficient to wash away waste from <b>the</b> <b>gutters.</b> A pipe connected the latrine to the cesspool, and sometimes a small amount of water washed waste through. Cesspools were cleaned out by tradesmen, who pumped out liquid waste, then shovelled out the solid waste and collected it during the night. This solid waste, euphemistically known as Nightsoil, was sold as fertilizer for agricultural production (similarly to the closing-the-loop approach of ecological sanitation).|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} {{optional}} net throwers {{that can make}} casting easier. These look like a lid from a trash can, including the handle on top. The outside circumference has a deep <b>gutter.</b> <b>The</b> net is loaded along <b>the</b> <b>gutter</b> and <b>the</b> weights are placed inside <b>the</b> <b>gutter.</b> <b>The</b> net is then tossed into the water using the thrower.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{significance}} of <b>the</b> <b>gutter</b> in graphic narrative. I will look at this empty space between the panels and how it works, and relates to the narrative. First I will delve into the surface of the physical appearance of <b>the</b> <b>gutter,</b> its function as a frame and a passe-partout, and inevitably how this affects the way we look at <b>the</b> <b>gutter</b> through <b>the</b> image and sequential art. Further I will see <b>the</b> <b>gutter</b> in a more traditional way – exploring and discussing the missing panels and how <b>the</b> <b>gutter</b> influences <b>the</b> different styles of storytelling. This will be from a more virtual perspective looking at that which apparently is not there, but recreated by the reader through a model of interpretation. As a concluding part of the thesis, these two aspects of the surface/depth, or real/virtual, will be combined to see how it affects the narratives, and how this might fit into an extended argument of <b>the</b> <b>gutter</b> and its role in graphic narrative...|$|R

25|$|Brodovitch {{released}} {{a book of}} these photographs in 1945, titled simply Ballet, through a small New York publisher. The book contains 104 photographs of several ballets and is divided into eleven segments, one for each ballet performance. On the contents page, Brodovitch introduces each chapter in a typographic style that emulates {{the feel of the}} dance it is describing. He photographed with a Contax 35mm camera, no flash, and with a slow film speed. The blurred figures of the dancers allow the viewer to not only feel the music, but also to follow the line of the dancer's limbs mid-step. The images beautifully capture the atmosphere on-stage, the frenzied behind-the-scenes action backstage, and the magical moments of the ballet. By bleeding the blurred, grainy pictures off the pages and into <b>the</b> <b>gutters,</b> he communicated the emotional impact of the dance without words.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of their father in 1882, {{brothers}} Charles Arthur and Leonard Gates took over the running of his shop, which held the local distribution franchise for Gilbey's wines and spirits, and also sold beer. However, in 1885, the brothers were persuaded to join the temperance movement, and they poured their entire stock into <b>the</b> <b>gutters</b> of the High Street. Left with no livelihood, they converted their now empty shop into a dairy. Using a milk separator, they bought milk from local farmers, and after extracting the cream and whey, sold the skim back to the farmers for pig feed. In 1888 three more of the Gates brothers and their sons joined the business, which led to the formal registration of the company under the name of the West Surrey Central Dairy Company, which after development of its dried milk baby formula in 1906 became Cow & Gate.|$|E
25|$|Godalming came {{to world}} {{attention}} in September 1881, {{when it became}} the first town {{in the world to}} have installed a public electricity supply. It was Calder & Barnet who installed a Siemens AC Alternator and dynamo which were powered by a waterwheel, located at Westbrook Mill, on the River Wey. There were a number of supply cables, some of which were laid in <b>the</b> <b>gutters,</b> that fed seven arc lights and 34 Swan incandescent lights. Floods in late 1881 caused problems and in the end Calder & Barnet withdrew from the contract. It was taken over by Siemens. Under Siemens the supply system grew and a number of technical problems were solved. But later on in 1884 the whole town reverted to gas lighting as Siemens failed to tender for a contract to light the town. This was due to a survey they undertook in the town that failed to provide adequate support to make the business viable. Siemens had also lost money on the scheme in the early years, but was prepared to stay on in order to gain experience. Electricity returned to the town in 1904.|$|E

50|$|The philatelic use of <b>the</b> word <b>gutter</b> is <b>the</b> space left between {{postage stamps}} which {{allows them to}} be {{separated}} or perforated. When stamps are printed on large sheets of paper that will be guillotined into smaller sheets along <b>the</b> <b>gutter</b> it will not exist on the finished sheet of stamps. Some sheets are specifically designed where two panes of stamps are separated by a <b>gutter</b> still in <b>the</b> finished sheet and gutters may, or may not, have some printing in <b>the</b> <b>gutter.</b> Since perforation of a particular width of stamps is normal, <b>the</b> <b>gutter</b> between <b>the</b> stamps is often {{the same size as}} the postage stamp.|$|R
50|$|Curb {{extensions}} complicate drainage. They obstruct <b>the</b> <b>gutter,</b> so a {{catch basin}} is needed at the uphill end {{to keep a}} puddle from forming. An alternate solution is placing {{a gap in the}} curb, allowing the stormwater in <b>the</b> <b>gutter</b> to irrigate a rain garden in the curb extension.|$|R
500|$|Terry Pratchett {{mentioned}} {{the game in}} Thud! as a popular children's game played in <b>the</b> <b>gutters</b> during Sam Vimes' childhood in Ankh-Morpork, originally called [...] "turd races" [...] before renaming it [...] "poohsticks" [...] to take the game upmarket.|$|E
500|$|Each {{rectangular}} page has {{the proportions}} 1.1 to 1, while the block of text has the reciprocal proportions, 0.91 (the same proportions, rotated 90°). If <b>the</b> <b>gutters</b> between the columns were removed, the text block would mirror the page's proportions. Typographer Robert Bringhurst {{referred to the}} codex as a [...] "subtle piece of craftsmanship".|$|E
500|$|Between 1814 and 1816 {{a chapel}} {{was built to}} Harrison's design at West Hall, High Legh to replace an earlier chapel. [...] This was a simple {{building}} that burnt out in 1891, some of its fabric being incorporated into a new church on the site, St John's Church. [...] In 1818 the Right Revd George Henry Law, Bishop of Chester, asked Harrison to carry out work on the south transept of Chester Cathedral, which was showing signs of instability. [...] This work involved building deep buttresses {{at the south end}} of the transept, and giving some attention to <b>the</b> <b>gutters.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} is," [...] said Andrew. [...] "There {{was about three}} feet of water in <b>the</b> <b>gutter</b> that turned us back; but the tides are low now and don't run out very far. As they get higher, <b>the</b> <b>gutter</b> would dry toward {{the last of the}} ebb." ...|$|R
2500|$|A foul (scored by an F on some {{computer}} scoring systems) {{refers to}} a ball that first rolls into <b>the</b> <b>gutter</b> and then strikes deadwood (felled pins resting in <b>the</b> <b>gutter)</b> or hops out of <b>the</b> <b>gutter</b> and strikes a standing pin, a [...] "lob"-bed ball that touches neither the approach, nor lane in the three meters' distance of lanebed before the lob line, or as in tenpins and duckpins, a roll made by a bowler's foot crossing over the foot foul line shared by nearly all bowling sports. Special scoring comes into play.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>gutter</b> {{treatment}} for ingrowing toenails consists of introducing a small guard {{along the side}} of the toenail and requires only three outpatient attendances. <b>The</b> <b>gutter</b> is left in place for eight to 12 weeks and then removed by the patient. Two studies were carried out to establish the long-term results of the method. In one, a preliminary retrospective study, 13 out of 25 patients who had received <b>the</b> <b>gutter</b> treatment were cured after one year compared with five out of 15 patients in whom the toenail had been avulsed. In a randomised prospective study 20 out of 36 patients (56 %) treated by <b>the</b> <b>gutter</b> method were cured after one year compared with 27 out of 32 (84 %) in whom the wedge resection procedure had been used. <b>The</b> <b>gutter</b> treatment demands little skill and may be carried out in general practice. It gives an excellent cosmetic result with immediate pain relief and does not compromise further surgery should this be required, thus fulfilling the main requirements for the primary treatment of choice...|$|R
500|$|The imbrices {{completed}} the waterproofing {{of the roof}} by arching over the joints between the vertical edges of the tegulae, dividing the roof into channels. Rain water flowed off the curved imbrices into the channels and down over the surfaces of the tegulae, and descended into the gutter (canalis). [...] In formal architecture the canalis had a plain or ornamented frontal piece set atop the entablature, immediately above the cornice. The semicircular opening {{at the front of}} the lowermost imbrex was often capped with an ornamental fronton, and the spouts which drained <b>the</b> <b>gutters</b> were frequently decorated with lions' heads (capita leonina) or other fantastic or grotesque faces.|$|E
500|$|An {{immediate}} focus during pre-production was Deadpool's suit, with Russ Shinkle and Film Illusions hired {{to create the}} costume. Shinkle noted that [...] "comic book art is fairly over the top in terms of physique", {{and he tried to}} balance that with reality. Reynolds did not wear a muscle suit under the costume, which Tim Miller felt gave the costume a slimmer, [...] "quintessential Deadpool" [...] look. Miller and Reynolds wept when they saw the completed costume, with Reynolds explaining that [...] "we fought like hell ... to make this the most faithful comic book to movie adaptation fans have ever seen. That’s hard to accomplish and a feat, but we’re just so happy with how this came out." [...] The costume was designed with the film's stunts in mind, with the eye areas on the mask removable so versions of the eyes better suited for the stunts could be used without changing the whole mask. The suit was difficult for the visual effects team to replicate with CGI, which visual effects supervisor Jonathan Rothbart blamed on its fabric. He described it as mesh that allowed dirt to [...] "get into <b>the</b> <b>gutters</b> and the cracks ... the light hits it, it still takes that orangey hue but as soon as it goes in the shadow it dropped to this more blueish of the dirt." [...] Film Illusions made six hero versions of the costume and twelve stunt-specific versions, along with three hero versions of Negasonic Teenage Warhead's costume.|$|E
