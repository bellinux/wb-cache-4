5|$|Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion {{is a key}} {{precursor}} to Bacon's later work, and he sustained its formal and thematic preoccupations throughout his career. The triptych format, the placement of figures behind glass in heavily gilded frames, the open mouth, the use of painterly distortion, the Furies, and {{the theme of the}} Crucifixion were all to reappear in later works. Bacon's principal mode of expression is introduced: the subjects are anatomically and physically distorted, and <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> <b>is</b> violent, foreboding, and relentlessly physical. In other respects the triptych stands apart from other paintings in his oeuvre. It refers directly to its inspirations, and interprets the source material in an uncharacteristically literal manner. The triptych is further distinct in that its creatures are located in an outside space; by 1948, Bacon's studies of heads and figures specifically emphasised their confinement in rooms or other closed spaces.|$|E

25|$|In 1972, Ralph Berry {{argued that}} Shakespeare was chiefly {{concerned}} with epistemology in this play. The lovers declare illusion to be reality, the actors declare reality to be illusion. The play ultimately reconciles the seemingly opposing views and vindicates imagination. Also in 1972, Thomas McFarland {{argued that the}} play is dominated by a mood of happiness {{and that it is}} one of the happiest literary creations ever produced. <b>The</b> <b>mood</b> <b>is</b> so lovely that the audience never feels fear or worry about the fate of the characters.|$|E
25|$|Nor {{does the}} {{painting}} use Diana as an allegorical portrait, a tradition for which had {{developed by the}} mid-17th century, with identifiable women depicted as the goddess, {{who was also a}} symbol of chastity. An example of this tradition is Diana and Her Nymphs, painted by Jacob van Loo in Amsterdam around 1648, about seven or eight years before Vermeer's work. (Vermeer's Diana has frequently been compared to van Loo's. In van Loo's painting, Diana also sits in a forest clearing {{with a small group of}} companions, but <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> <b>is</b> very different.|$|E

500|$|Throughout Buffy the Vampire Slayer, music {{serves as}} a {{narrative}} tool, integral to character development and action. <b>The</b> <b>mood</b> <b>is</b> set by music, characters discuss it, and writers use it to emphasize differences between generations. In an essay {{on the use of}} music in the series, Jacqueline Bach writes that in conjunction with the sixth season themes of growing up, [...] "Once More, with Feeling" [...] gives music a central role instead of keeping it in the background.|$|E
500|$|The final symphony, the Ninth, was {{completed}} in late 1957 and premiered in April 1958, four months before the composer's death. It is scored for a large orchestra, including three saxophones, a flugelhorn, and an enlarged percussion section. <b>The</b> <b>mood</b> <b>is</b> more sombre {{than that of the}} Eighth; Grove calls its mood [...] "at once heroic and contemplative, defiant and wistfully absorbed". The work received an ovation at its premiere, but at first the critics were not sure what to make of it, and it took some years for it to be generally ranked alongside its eight predecessors.|$|E

500|$|According to the Spin Alternative Record Guide (1995), Rhythm Killers [...] "truly broke ground" [...] {{after the}} {{experimentation}} on Language Barrier {{and served as}} [...] "the story of late-20th-century black music done as symphony." [...] Music journalist Peter Shapiro noticed [...] "a striking collision of urban sounds" [...] in the album's music, while Robert Hilburn called it an [...] "unpredictable salute to the liveliness and character of urban pop music in its broadest sense." [...] Mike Joyce of The Washington Post found it [...] "more punchy and elastic" [...] than Language Barrier and felt [...] "the accent is still on electronic rhythms, but <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> <b>is</b> vibrantly expansive". Robert Christgau called the album Sly and Robbie's [...] "Laswellized art-funk statement". He characterized the duo as a [...] "world pop" [...] rhythm section and said their style is complemented by [...] "a chauvinistic variation on Bill Laswell's usual international brigade". John Leland argued that the album is [...] "the continuous synthesis that Laswell promised on Herbie Hancock's 'Rockit'", [...] "extended in both length and scope", as it features [...] "a knack for unexpected juxtapositions and no respect for artificial boundaries." [...] According to The Nation, the sounds on the record ranged from Ludwig van Beethoven to Jimi Hendrix.|$|E
500|$|Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club said, [...] "Hall Of Fame doubles {{down on the}} {{carefree}} {{spirit of}} its predecessor. <b>The</b> <b>mood</b> <b>is</b> so consistently upbeat and agreeable that nearly everything works, especially the tracks that pair Sean with a strong singer." [...] Eric Diep of XXL commented that, [...] "Hall Of Fame moves along at a steady pace for the most part," [...] but there are instances where the album is less than consistent. Concluding that, [...] "even these minor shortcomings don't supersede {{the fact that the}} album is filled with radio-friendly cuts and compelling storytelling." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic said, while Hall of Fame provides plenty of vibrant, sexual, exciting moments, the [...] "classic feel" [...] that was intended is [...] "nowhere to be found." [...] Erin Lowers of Exclaim! commented that, [...] "While Hall of Fame escapes the dreaded sophomore curse, it doesn't do so unscathed. [...] Big Sean may not have solidified his position in the rap hall of fame, but is certainly in the process of paving his way." [...] David Turner of Spin said, [...] "Kanye's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is an immediate parallel to this album of relationship struggle and soul-searching, and while Sean obviously lacks his mentor's star power or ambition, he shows more heart than he typically gets credit for." [...] Jesal Padania of RapReviews.com called the individual tracks distinct, big and bold, while the album remains consistent. However, said that the album lacks any classic material.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{indicative}} <b>mood</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> default <b>mood,</b> and, alongside <b>the</b> imperative, the oldest.

2500|$|A manic {{episode is}} defined in the American Psychiatric Association's {{diagnostic}} manual as a [...] "distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary)," [...] where <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> <b>is</b> not caused by drugs/medication or a medical illness (e.g., hyperthyroidism), and (a) is causing obvious difficulties at work or in social relationships and activities, or (b) requires admission to hospital to protect the person or others, or (c) the person is suffering psychosis.|$|E
2500|$|Problematic point(s): {{there are}} several {{received}} expressions referring to function that are written separately despite the above rules (e.g. kijelentő mód ’indicative mood’ lit. ’declaring mood’, even though <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> <b>is</b> used for declarations, it doesn’t declare anything), so it is sometimes not obvious how a newly coined construction should be written. In addition, present participles sometimes become nouns, and their compounds cannot be written in two words, as they cannot be considered adjectives anymore. For example, labdarúgó ’footballer’ was created from a participle (lit. ’ball-kicking’ [...] ) {{but it is a}} noun today, and since labdarúgómez ’footballer’s strip’ implies a possessive relationship, it must be written in one word.|$|E

2500|$|A framing device {{portrays the}} events of the play as newscasts and {{newspaper}} headlines. The film's action sequences were reminiscent of the films of Sam Peckinpah and John Woo, and its characters wear designer clothes and (in Douglas Brode's words) [...] "a lingerie collection worthy of Madonna". As Peter Travers commented in Rolling Stone, the intention was to [...] "make Romeo and Juliet accessible to the elusive Gen-X audience without leaving the play bowdlerised and broken". Some aspects of the modernisation have been praised as effective (a newscaster speaking the prologue, for example, or the replacement of Friar John with a courier message which gets misdelivered); others have been criticised as ridiculous: including a police chief banishing Romeo for a street killing rather than ordering his arrest. Luhrmann highlighted the religious aspects of the play, surrounding his two central characters with religious icons, and staging his finale in a cathedral. That final scene was regarded by some critics as Luhrmann's masterstroke: adapting a device first used in restoration adaptations of the play, Juliet begins to wake before Romeo takes the poison, but he does not notice her movements until he has done so, then he dies aware that she has survived. The scene uses cuts and extreme close-ups to generate a tension impossible to achieve in the theatre. <b>The</b> <b>mood</b> <b>is</b> undermined a moment later as Juliet blows her brains out with a pistol. The role of the watch is cut completely, permitting Friar Laurence to be with Juliet and to be taken by surprise by her sudden suicide.|$|E
2500|$|Debney called Iron Man 2 [...] "odd in {{that there}} were {{not a lot of}} places where a true superhero theme could be played. Tony Stark is uber cool even as Iron Man, so, musically, we couldn’t state a {{full-blown}} superhero theme. The strains of Iron Man’s theme are heard only in a few spots by design. I’m hoping with future films, Iron Man might get his full-blown theme played aggressively." [...] For instance, Debney recorded several different versions of the score for scenes where Stark puts on the Iron Man suit, each with [...] "different portions of the theme fleshed out or left out". What was ultimately chosen [...] "was less thematic. It was sort of a groove {{with a little bit of}} French horn. Maybe that was the right choice, but it was a difficult decision. It was difficult to find the areas in the movie where we could let Tony be a superhero." [...] He continued, [...] "There were moments where I wanted to play a scene broadly or make a love scene out of it but we were never able to go there", such as for the end of the film where [...] "Tony finally kisses Pepper ... there were a couple of versions I did that were really gorgeous and lush but it just didn't fit. It's a different kind of movie because they kiss and then all of a sudden <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> <b>is</b> broken. It's just the nature of this character." [...] Debney felt that this process led to the score being [...] "watered down and mashed up a little bit" [...] from what he originally intended. However, Debney did not feel the same about his music for the villain, Ivan Vanko, which he described as a personal [...] "joy". He said that Favreau [...] "gave me a great opportunity to get into [...] scene and learn 's circumstances and to play sincerely sad music for him and the relationship he had with his father. Jon gave me the opportunity to morph that and turn it into something really dark and twisted. For me that was the most satisfactory part of the score and the film". For Vanko's theme, the choir sang in Russian to [...] "capture the dark Russian soul" [...] of the character.|$|E
