He said, [...] "My God, I didn't know <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> existed. How can a country like this allow it? Maybe they just don't know."

The Lincoln matter was getting large-scale press attention and the senators became commonly known as the [...] "Keating Five". All the senators denied they had done anything improper in the matter, and said Keating's contributions made no difference to their actions.

Jennifer has said that her own unexpected conception and birth defects were the basis for the film's themes. The film's tone was also shaped by Lynch's time living in a troubled neighborhood in Philadelphia. Lynch and his family spent five years living in an atmosphere of [...] "violence, hate and filth". The area was rife with crime, inspiring the bleak urban backdrop of Eraserhead. Describing this period of his life, Lynch said, [...] "I saw so many things in Philadelphia I couldn't believe...

[...] However, the team were beaten comprehensively in the next round to Chelsea at Highbury, losing 0–5. The result inflicted Arsenal's biggest defeat in over eight years and Wenger defended his team selection, virtually a 'second team': [...] "I knew before the game that <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> might happen. You only had to look at the team sheets. If we had won I would still have gone on playing the same side because the players need the experience." [...] Bergkamp, who was rested for the match, echoed his manager's comments: [...] "We had a lot of young players on the field against Chelsea and, although they were feeling very down after losing like that, they will learn from it.

500|$|A problem arose {{historically}} {{which held}} up progress for twenty years: although {{we start with}} the assumption of three basic [...] "simple" [...] actions, {{the rules of the game}} say that if we want to calculate the probability amplitude for an electron to get from A to B we must take into account all the possible ways: all possible Feynman diagrams with those end points. [...] Thus there will be a way in which the electron travels to C, emits a photon there and then absorbs it again at D before moving on to B. Or it could do <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> twice, or more. In short we have a fractal-like situation in which if we look closely at a line it breaks up into a collection of [...] "simple" [...] lines, each of which, if looked at closely, are in turn composed of [...] "simple" [...] lines, and so on ad infinitum. This is a very difficult situation to handle. If adding that detail only altered things slightly then it would not have been too bad, but disaster struck when it was found that the simple correction mentioned above led to infinite probability amplitudes.

[...] AOL Radio considered the song the best of 2010 hip hop music, regarding Eminem as imaginative and passionate. It ranked ninth on MTV News' top-twenty-five list. Its editor James Montgomery attributed the song's success to its theme and relation to the artists' past abusive relationships. He concluded, [...] "You cannot write a song any better than that, because that's how <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> happens in real life."

He remarked that it [...] "starts out intense and crazy" [...] but [...] "becomes fairly predictable {{in its second}} half," [...] as he correctly predicted Walternate's involvement in the abduction. Murray concluded, [...] "Ultimately, 'Bloodline' {{is more of a}} plot-mover than most episodes of Fringe. There’s no additional case to solve, and no profound theme to explore. If anything, it’s like the writers decided to inject a serum into the belly of show and accelerate the story, to get Fauxlivia’s baby out and to get on to the next phase."

[...] Rating the episode 7.5/10, Isler added that [...] "the story could have used a bit more misdirection and a red herring or two to really keep us guessing, but that's a minor critique. Overall, Walternate's Machiavellian role in this story works, and the most important takeaway from this story is that it moved the overarching plot forward in one huge leap. Instead of waiting nine 'story' months for Fauxlivia's baby to pop out, we've already got the kid ready to fit into whatever plot twist the show runners have planned." ...|$|E
