5|$|<b>The</b> <b>essential</b> <b>elements</b> of the {{coronation}} have remained largely unchanged {{for the past}} thousand years. The sovereign is first presented to, and acclaimed by, the people. He or she then swears an oath to uphold {{the law and the}} Church. Following that, the monarch is anointed with holy oil, invested with regalia, and crowned, before receiving the homage of his or her subjects. Wives of kings are then anointed and crowned as queen consort. The service ends with a closing procession, and since the 20th century it has been traditional for the royal family to appear later on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, before attending a banquet there.|$|E

25|$|While not {{a legally}} {{mandated}} requirement, public art {{was part of}} the urban design planning process (and later design development work) through the Artery Arts Program. The intent of the program was to integrate public art into highway infrastructure (retaining walls, fences, and lighting) and <b>the</b> <b>essential</b> <b>elements</b> of the pedestrian environment (walkways, park landscape elements, and bridges). As overall project costs increased, the Artery Arts Program was seen as a potential liability, even though there was support and interest from the public and professional arts organizations in the area.|$|E
25|$|Held {{that the}} word 'amendment' {{was used in the}} sense of {{permitting}} a change, in contradistinction to destruction, which the repeal or abrogation brings about. Therefore, the width of the power of amendment could not be enlarged by amending the amending power itself. The learned Judge held that <b>the</b> <b>essential</b> <b>elements</b> of the basic structure of the Constitution are reflected in its preamble and that some of the important features of the Constitution are justice, freedom of expression and equality of status and opportunity. The word 'amendment' could not possibly embrace the right to abrogate the pivotal features and the fundamental freedoms and therefore, that part of the basic structure could not be damaged or destroyed. According to the learned Judge, the provisions of Article 31d, as they hen, conferring power on Parliament and the State Legislatures to enact laws for giving effect to the principles specified in Clauses (b) and (c) of Article 39, altogether abrogated the right given by Article 14 and were for that reason unconstitutional. In conclusion, the learned Judge held that though the power of amendment was wide, it did not comprehend the power to totally abrogate or emasculate or damage any of the fundamental rights or <b>the</b> <b>essential</b> <b>elements</b> of the basic structure of the Constitution or to destroy the identity of the Constitution. Subject to these limitations, Parliament had the right to amend any and every provision of the Constitution.|$|E

25|$|Working with non-disabled {{children}} in the Casa dei Bambini in 1907, Montessori began to develop her own pedagogy. <b>The</b> <b>essential</b> <b>elements</b> of her educational theory emerged from this work, described in The Montessori Method in 1912 and in The Discovery of the Child in 1948. Her method was founded on the observation of children at liberty to act freely in an environment prepared to meet their needs. Montessori {{came to the conclusion}} that the children's spontaneous activity in this environment revealed an internal program of development, and that the appropriate role of the educator was to remove obstacles to this natural development and provide opportunities for it to proceed and flourish.|$|E
25|$|Due to an {{increase}} in costs and in order to decrease the noise pollution for the population flight simulators are increasingly used. Only <b>the</b> <b>essential</b> <b>elements</b> of flight training are practised by using actual helicopters. By 2012 the German armed forces had intend to have implemented the new Tiger and NH-90 helicopters. Consequently, training on the Bell UH-1D was to be reduced and terminated in September 2010. The remaining Bell UH-1D helicopters were handed over to Faßberg Air Base where they will be flown until the delivery of the new NH-90 helicopter. The practicing of autorotation was to be continued at Celle as this could not be trained on the standard helicopter for initial flight training, the Eurocopter EC-135 stationed at the main base of Army Aviation School at Bückeburg. However, with the forthcoming discontinuation of flying activities at Celle Air Base, the practice of autoration will be trained elesewhere.|$|E

50|$|Experiments {{into what}} made plants grow first {{led to the}} idea that the ash left behind when plant matter was burned was <b>the</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> but {{overlooked}} <b>the</b> role of nitrogen, which is not left on the ground after combustion, a belief which prevailed until the 19th century. In about 1635, the Flemish chemist Jan Baptist van Helmont thought he had proved water to be <b>the</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> from his famous five years' experiment with a willow tree grown with only the addition of rainwater. His conclusion came {{from the fact that the}} increase in the plant's weight had apparently been produced only by the addition of water, with no reduction in the soil's weight. John Woodward (d. 1728) experimented with various types of water ranging from clean to muddy and found muddy water the best, and so he concluded that earthy matter was <b>the</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element.</b> Others concluded it was humus in the soil that passed some essence to the growing plant. Still others held that the vital growth principal was something passed from dead plants or animals to the new plants. At the start of the 18th century, Jethro Tull demonstrated that it was beneficial to cultivate (stir) the soil, but his opinion that the stirring made the fine parts of soil available for plant absorption was erroneous.|$|R
