Using data from the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS), these analyses compare coverage differences among and within ethnic subgroups, across states and regions, among <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupations,</b> and among those with or without English language proficiency. Extensive differences exist in coverage between Latinos and Asians, with Latinos more likely to be uninsured. Potential explanations include the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupations</b> available to Latinos and Asians, reforms in immigration laws, length of time in the United States, and regional differences in safety-net coverage. Policy implications are discussed. Reliance on public health insurance or having no health insurance of any form is more common among racial/ethnic minorities as compared to white Americans.
