The specific goal of this research was to validate SSAM as a tool for accident prediction at urban intersections. Two methods were used for validation. The first method compared the simulated number of conflicts from the use of SSAM and the predicted number of injury accidents from analytic models in three reference intersection layouts (four-leg priority intersection, four-leg staggered intersection, and single-lane roundabout). The second method compared SSAM results with conflicts observed on site in four real intersections: two priority ones and two roundabouts.

30|$|MS Data A typical {{simulation}} outputs multiple <b>trajectory</b> <b>files</b> {{containing a}} number of snapshots (named frames) of the simulated system. Depending on the software and format, such data may be stored in binary form and undergo simple lossless compression. The {{main part of the}} data is very similar to those found in spatio-temporal databases. A typical trajectory file has some global data, which is used to identify the simulation, and a set of frames arranged in a sequential manner. Each frame may contain data entries that are independent of the atom index. The main part of trajectory frame is a sequential list of atoms with their positions, velocities, perhaps forces, masses, and types. These entries may contain additional quantities like identifiers to place an atom in particular residue or molecule. In file-based approach, the bond structure of residues is stored separately in topology files and the control parameters of a simulation are kept separately in control files. Hence, any sharing of data or analysis requires consistent exchange or availability of three types of files. Further complications in data exchange/use is due to different naming and storage convention used by individual researchers.|$|E

The charge equilibration method gives a correct prediction of compatibility in the studied temperature range. Moreover, it shows a positive variation of the Flory-Huggins parameter with temperature, {{in agreement with the}} phase behavior of these blends that show a lower critical temperature.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} traffic safety of freeway {{interchange}} merging areas {{based on the}} traffic conflict technique. The hourly composite risk indexes (HCRI) was defined. By the use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography and video processing techniques, the conflict type and severity was judged. Time to collision (TTC) was determined with the traffic conflict evaluation index. Then, the TTC severity threshold was determined. Quantizing {{the weight of the}} conflict by direct losses of different severities of freeway traffic accidents, the calculated weight of the HCRI can be obtained. Calibration of the relevant parameters of the micro-simulation simulator VISSIM is conducted by the travel time according to the field data. Variables are placed into orthogonal tables at different levels. On the basis of this table, the <b>trajectory</b> <b>file</b> of every traffic condition is simulated, and then submitted into a surrogate safety assessment model (SSAM), identifying the number of hourly traffic conflicts in the merging area, a statistic of HCRI. Moreover, the multivariate linear regression model was presented and validated to study the relationship between HCRI and the influencing variables. A comparison between the HCRI model and the hourly conflicts ratio (HCR), without weight, shows that the HCRI model fitting degree was obviously higher than the HCR.

40|$|Mutations in the {{fibrinogen}} {{gamma chain}} (FGG) gene {{have been associated}} with various disorders, such as dysfibrinogenemia, thrombophilia, and hypofibrinogenemia. A literature survey showed that a residue exchange in fibrinogen Milano I from γ Asp to Val at position 330 impairs fibrin polymerization. The D 356 V (D 330 V) mutation located in the C-terminus was predicted to be highly deleterious and to affect the function of the protein. The pathogenicity of the altered gene and changes in protein functions were predicted using in silico methods, such as SIFT, PolyPhen 2, I-Mutant 3. 0, Align GV-GD, PhD-SNP, and SNPs&GO. The secondary structure of the mutant protein was unwound {{by the end of the}} 50 -ns simulation period, and a structural change in the helix-turn transition of the alpha-helical (352 - 356) region residues was observed. Moreover, a change in the length of the helical region was visualized in the mutant <b>trajectory</b> <b>file,</b> indicating the local transient unfolding of the protein. The obtained computational results suggest that the substitution of the neutral amino acid valine for the acidic amino acid aspartic acid at position 356 results in an unwound conformation within 50  ns, which might contribute to defective polymerization.

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} {{were carried}} out to simulate binding interactions between S' subsites of thrombin and hirudin-based thrombin inhibitors. These inhibitors include three segments: an active-site segment, N alpha-acetyl-(D-Phe) -Pro-Arg-Pro-; a fibrinogen-recognition exo-site segment, hirudin 55 - 65; and a 13 -atom-long linker. These linkers have been reported (Szewczuk et al. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 3396) to influence the binding potency while keeping the same active and exo-site segments. The study found that, by combining different omega-amino acids, the potency could be increased 8 -fold or decreased 4 -fold compared to the native hirudin linker, -Gln-Ser-His-Asn-Asp-Gly-. Five typical linkers were simulated and compared. Analyzing the <b>trajectory</b> <b>files</b> led to the classification of three different dynamic behaviours for the linkers. The flexible linkers had no influence on the antithrombin activity. Other linkers formed hydrogen bonds with the thrombin S' subsite residues Glu 39, leu 40, and Gln 151. Formations of some hydrogen bonds enhanced the potency of the inhibitor. In other cases, the hydrogen bonds caused the distortion of the inhibitor conformation while affected the binding potency. Based on these observations, a general binding mode in the S' subsites of thrombin is proposed and potential applications are discussed. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

A modified, parallelized version of Brenner's potential was used to model interatomic forces within each molecule. A Leonard-Jones 6 - 12 potential was used for forces between molecules. One gear was powered by forcing the atoms {{near the end of}} the buckytube to rotate, and a second gear was allowed. to rotate by keeping the atoms near the end of its buckytube on a cylinder. The meshing aromatic gear teeth transfer angular momentum from the powered gear to the driven gear. A number of gear and gear/shaft configurations were simulated.

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this study is}} to explore whether the VISSIM {{simulation}} model and Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM) can be used to provide the reasonable estimates for pedestrian-vehicle conflicts at signalized intersections. Two types of pedestrian-vehicle conflicts are discussed in this study, including vehicle-yield-pedestrian and pedestrian-yield-vehicle. A total of 42 hours videos were recorded at seven signalized intersections for field data collection. The calibrated and validated VISSIM model was used to generate pedestrian-vehicle conflicts and SSAM software was used to extract these conflicts by processing the vehicle <b>trajectory</b> <b>file</b> from the VISSIM model. The mean absolute percent error (MAPE) was used to determine the maximum TTC and PET thresholds for pedestrian-vehicle conflicts.

Moreover, the linear regression was developed to study the relationship between simulated conflicts from the micro-simulation and the observed conflicts from the field. The result indicated that there was a significant statistical relationship between the simulated conflicts and the observed conflicts. However, it was also found that the VISSIM model underestimated the pedestrian-vehicle conflicts. One possible reason was that the VISSIM simulation cannot generate the pedestrian-vehicle conflicts that involved the illegal pedestrian behaviors such as red light violation in the real world...|$|R

40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that protein dynamics and conformational changes {{can play an}} important role in modulating biological function. As a result, experimental and computational methods are being developed, often synergistically, to study the dynamical heterogeneity of a protein or other macromolecules in solution. Thus, methods such as molecular dynamics simulations or ensemble refinement approaches have provided conformational ensembles that can be used to understand protein function and biophysics. These developments have in turn created a need for algorithms and software that can be used to compare structural ensembles in the same way as the root-mean-square-deviation is often used to compare static structures. Although a few such approaches have been proposed, these can be difficult to implement efficiently, hindering a broader applications and further developments. Here, we present an easily accessible software toolkit, called ENCORE, which can be used to compare conformational ensembles generated either from simulations alone or synergistically with experiments. ENCORE implements three previously described methods for ensemble comparison, that each can be used to quantify the similarity between conformational ensembles by estimating the overlap between the probability distributions that underlie them. We demonstrate the kinds of insights that can be obtained by providing examples of three typical use-cases: comparing ensembles generated with different molecular force fields, assessing convergence in molecular simulations, and calculating differences and similarities in structural ensembles refined with various sources of experimental data. We also demonstrate efficient computational scaling for typical analyses, and robustness against both the size and sampling of the ensembles. ENCORE is freely available and extendable, integrates with the established MDAnalysis software package, reads ensemble data in many common formats, and can work with large <b>trajectory</b> <b>files...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{have been}} {{conducting}} a systematic {{study of the}} middle and lower atmosphere of Venus through analysis of 20 radio occultation experiments conducted with the Magellan spacecraft between October, 1991, and August, 1994. These studies have revealed a rich but sparsely sampled trove of information regarding the structure, composition and dynamics of the Venus atmosphere. The five sets of experiments sampled a variety of latitudes. Basic results include vertical profiles of: (1) electron density in the ionosphere, (2) pressure, temperature, density, and static stability in the neutral atmosphere (from 33 km to 98 km), and (3) sulfuric acid vapor (H 2 SO 4) abundance below the main cloud deck. Further analysis of the temperature profiles led {{to the discovery of}} small vertical-scale gravity waves in the neutral atmosphere. The retrieved profiles show intriguing zonal variations that might be due to planetary- scale waves. During the performance period of this grant, we have concentrated on reanalyzing the 15 experiments conducted in 1994 using improved <b>trajectory</b> <b>files</b> for Magellan provided by JPL, obtaining more reliable results, and on conducting an error analysis of the derived profiles. In addition, we have begun an analysis of microwave emission maps of Venus obtained at the Very Large Array (VLA) in April, 1996. This report is organized as follows: A summary of results is presented, giving representative examples of the various physical profiles retrieved from all the Magellan radio occultation studies, emphasizing latitudinal variations evident in the data. Next, a preliminary analysis of the VLA maps is given. A summary of activities follows the scientific results, detailing papers published and presented at various conferences. This report concludes with a "Conclusions and Suggestions for Future Work" section...|$|E

40|$|Ion {{conduction}} {{mechanisms of}} ion channels are a long-standing conundrum. Although the molecular dynamics (MD) method {{has been extensively}} used to simulate ion conduction dynamics at the atomic level, analysis and interpretation of MD results are not straightforward due to complexity of the dynamics. In our previous reports, we proposed an analytical method called ion-binding state analysis to scrutinize and summarize ion conduction mechanisms {{by taking advantage of}} a variety of analytical protocols, e. g., the complex network analysis, sequence alignment, and hierarchical clustering. This approach effectively revealed the ion conduction mechanisms and their dependence on the conditions, i. e., ion concentration and membrane voltage. Here, we present an easy-to-use computational toolkit for ion-binding state analysis, called IBiSA_tools. This toolkit consists of a C++ program and a series of Python and R scripts. From the <b>trajectory</b> <b>file</b> of MD simulations and a structure file, users can generate several images and statistics of ion conduction processes. A complex network named ion-binding state graph is generated in a standard graph format (graph modeling language; GML), which can be visualized by standard network analyzers such as Cytoscape. As a tutorial, a trajectory of a 50 ns MD simulation of the Kv 1. 2 channel is also distributed with the toolkit. Users can trace the entire process of ion-binding state analysis step by step. The novel method for analysis of ion conduction mechanisms of ion channels can be easily used by means of IBiSA_tools.
