5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>shutdown,</b> some 19,000 state {{employees}} were laid off. State {{and federal government}} employees in Minnesota lost approximately $65 million in wages {{over the course of}} <b>the</b> <b>shutdown.</b> Because of court rulings, some of the 36,000 {{state employees}} who received layoff notices leading up to <b>the</b> <b>shutdown</b> continued or returned to work during <b>the</b> <b>shutdown.</b> Laid-off employees were immediately eligible for unemployment benefits, and continued to receive health insurance, costing the state millions a week.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} closed most non-essential offices during <b>the</b> <b>shutdown,</b> {{which was}} the longest in U.S. history. <b>The</b> <b>shutdown</b> ended when Clinton agreed to submit a CBO-approved balanced budget plan.|$|E
5|$|While {{public schools}} {{remained}} open during <b>the</b> <b>shutdown,</b> and teachers {{continued to be}} paid following Gearin's ruling, <b>the</b> <b>shutdown</b> interfered with their operations, and would have caused serious problems if it had continued. Teachers could not renew or receive new licenses during <b>the</b> <b>shutdown,</b> creating a backlog, and property tax levy approvals could have been delayed. No fishing, hunting, and boating licenses or new drivers' licenses were issued during <b>the</b> <b>shutdown.</b> Taxes continued to be due, but tax refunds stopped.|$|E
25|$|A Macau {{resident}} {{was arrested}} on April 26 for posting a message on cyberctm.com encouraging people to disrupt the relay. Both orchidbbs.com and cyberctm.com Internet forums were shut down from May 2 to 4. This fueled speculation that <b>the</b> <b>shutdowns</b> were targeting speeches against the relay. The head of the Bureau of Telecommunications Regulation has denied that <b>the</b> <b>shutdowns</b> of <b>the</b> websites were politically motivated. About 2,200 police were deployed on the streets, there were no interruptions.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the costs associated with}} staff, Minnesota lost some revenue during <b>the</b> <b>shutdown.</b> The Minnesota State Lottery did not sell tickets during <b>the</b> <b>shutdown,</b> which meant the state could have lost about $1.25 million in revenue daily. Minnesota stopped selling tax stamps for cigarettes, which must be affixed to each pack before sale. The Star Tribune reported that cigarette sales would come to a halt by mid-August if no more tax stamps were issued. The state also stopped issuing liquor purchasing cards, which businesses need in order to purchase liquor from wholesalers. Many stores, bars, and restaurants renewed their liquor purchasing cards before <b>the</b> <b>shutdown.</b> However, the purchasing cards for approximately three hundred establishments expired {{on the first day of}} <b>the</b> <b>shutdown,</b> July 1. Liquor purchasing cards would have continued to expire on the first day of each month. Alcohol brand licenses expired, so MillerCoors lost their license to sell 39 brands of beer in Minnesota, and had to have them removed from shelves.|$|E
5|$|In total, about $48 {{million in}} revenue was lost, and over $10 million was spent on {{expenses}} related to preparing for and recovering from <b>the</b> <b>shutdown.</b> Overall, <b>the</b> <b>shutdown</b> disrupted the state government's activities, the lives of some Minnesotans (especially the most vulnerable), and private sector work such as road construction, but had minimal impact on the larger economy of the state.|$|E
5|$|During {{the casino}} shutdown, 36,000 casino workers were given leave. <b>The</b> <b>shutdown</b> of casinos {{resulted}} in lost {{revenue for the}} state, as an estimated $1.3 million per day was collected in gambling taxes plus an additional $2 million per day due to {{the closure of the}} lottery system. However, the sum of revenue not collected during <b>the</b> <b>shutdown</b> from gambling amounted to just {{a small fraction of the}} state's annual budget. Atlantic City's 12 casinos suffered losses estimated at $16–20 million per day during <b>the</b> <b>shutdown.</b> Revenue losses to lottery vendors and casino employees have not been calculated. Legislation signed by Governor Corzine in June 2008 would keep casinos and racetracks open in the event of a future budget showdown, with the Governor noting that the casino industry is vital to the New Jersey economy and that it should not operate under the threat of closure as it did in 2006.|$|E
50|$|The {{failure of}} Congress and the President {{to enact the}} {{remaining}} appropriations legislation led to government shutdowns during November 13-19, 1995 and December 15, 1995, through January 6, 1996. <b>The</b> <b>shutdowns</b> were triggered by the expiration of continuing resolutions. <b>The</b> first <b>shutdown</b> caused <b>the</b> furlough of about 800,000 federal employees, while the second affected 284,000 due to additional appropriations bills enacted in the interim.|$|R

5|$|The 2006 New Jersey state {{government}} shutdown {{was the first}} shutdown {{in the history of}} the U.S. state of New Jersey. <b>The</b> <b>shutdown</b> occurred after the New Jersey Legislature and Governor Jon Corzine failed to agree on a state budget by the constitutional deadline. Furthermore, Corzine and the Legislature clashed on the issue of raising the state sales tax to help balance budget. Exercising his constitutional powers as governor, Corzine ordered <b>the</b> <b>shutdown</b> as a means of pressuring the Legislature to pass a budget. <b>The</b> <b>shutdown</b> began at midnight on July 1, 2006, when Corzine called for an orderly shutdown of non-essential government services, which was followed by a second round of shutdowns three days later on July 4.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 Minnesota state {{government}} shutdown was a government shutdown affecting the U.S. state of Minnesota. <b>The</b> <b>shutdown</b> {{was the result}} of a fiscal dispute between the Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL) Governor Mark Dayton and the Republican-majority Minnesota Legislature, that was not resolved by the constitutional deadline on June 30. The Republican caucuses and their leaders demanded bigger spending cuts, and for the budget shortfall to be met without tax increases, while Dayton demanded some tax increases. <b>The</b> <b>shutdown</b> started at midnight on July 1, and ended after a budget bill was passed and signed on July 20.|$|E

50|$|Before <b>the</b> analog <b>shutdown</b> XHTAO's {{audio signal}} {{could be heard}} at 87.7 MHz on FM radios, though at a {{slightly}} lower volume than other FM stations, due to technical reasons. After <b>the</b> analog <b>shutdown</b> this couldn't been possible {{due to the nature}} of digital TV.|$|R
5|$|At {{that time}} <b>the</b> <b>shutdown</b> began, all state {{government}} spending and operations {{not considered to be}} critical stopped. Suspended state services included driving tests, childcare assistance, senior and disability linkage lines, criminal background checks, and road construction. State government offices, state parks, highway rest areas, and sites run by the Minnesota Historical Society, among others, closed. The commissioner of the Department of Human Services, Lucinda Jesson, said that letters had to be sent to over 580,000 households that relied on the department for social services to notify them about the possible shutdown. More critical parts of the state government, including public safety, health care, benefit payments, and care for residents of state facilities continued. Services that were continued during <b>the</b> <b>shutdown</b> could have amounted to as much as 80 percent of state spending.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} days of <b>the</b> <b>shutdown,</b> many {{programs}} requested that their funding continue, especially social service organizations that relied on state funding. To hear their pleas, the courts appointed retired State Supreme Court judge Kathleen Blatz as a special master. Dayton and State Attorney General Lori Swanson also both submitted petitions to the Ramsey County District Court when <b>the</b> <b>shutdown</b> began, asking for the court to clarify whether some programs could continue. Judges Kathleen Gearin and Bruce W. Christopherson issued their rulings on July 7, finding that some programs could start again, including criminal background checks, public schools, and local government aid. Gearin complained that the governor and legislature should have been responsible for making decisions about which services could stay open. Gearin had previously heard a case from the Minnesota Zoo, which asked to remain open despite <b>the</b> <b>shutdown,</b> and another from the Canterbury Park horse racing track in Shakopee. While both pay for themselves at least during the summer, Gearin determined that only the Zoo was allowed to operate without legislative appropriations, so she allowed the Zoo to open on July 2 but ordered Canterbury Park to remain closed the same day.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} two weeks of <b>the</b> <b>shutdown,</b> there was little {{progress}} and neither the governor nor the Republican leaders made proposals accepted by the other side. On July 4, Republican lawmakers affirmed their commitment to not agree to a budget of over $34 billion. Documents leaked after June 30 stated that the Republican leadership included anti-abortion provisions, a voter ID requirement, and a ban on stem cell research during the budget negotiations. Both the Republican legislative leaders and Dayton (along with DFL legislative leaders) toured Minnesota to make their case to Minnesotans. The government shutdown ended after Governor Dayton announced on July 14 that he would accept the last Republican offer before <b>the</b> <b>shutdown,</b> albeit with certain conditions.|$|E

5|$|In {{the state}} {{elections}} of 2012, during which {{all members of}} the legislature (but not the governor) were up for election, <b>the</b> <b>shutdown</b> was a major campaign issue. The Republicans lost their majorities in both houses of the legislature, giving the DFL full control of the state government. Kurt Zellers and other Republican legislators said <b>the</b> <b>shutdown</b> probably was one reason for their electoral defeat. However, other national and state issues may have had more of an influence on the result. The presidential race was also on the ballot, as were the proposed Minnesota Marriage Amendment and Voter ID Amendment, which had been put on the ballot by the legislature in 2011. All of these ballot items increased the turnout of DFL-leaning voters.|$|E
5|$|In {{three of}} the {{previous}} five years, the legislature had {{failed to meet the}} June 30 deadline. On each of those occasions an agreement had been reached by the morning of July 2.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} the Test Automation Framework (TAF) on the Mars Polar Lander (MPL) software. <b>The</b> premature <b>shutdown</b> of <b>the</b> descent engine on the MPL spacecraft {{is believed to be the}} most likely cause for the mission failure. It is believed that <b>the</b> engine <b>shutdown</b> occurred when <b>the</b> three landing legs were extended into their deployed position. This event created an unanticipated transient touchdown indication from the legs, causing the software to inadvertently <b>shutdown</b> <b>the</b> descent engines prior to reaching the surface of Mars. This spurious indication should have been ignored by the Touchdown Monitor (TDM) software, but due to a design flaw, was actually “latched, ” thus causing <b>the</b> premature engine <b>shutdown.</b> <b>The</b> TAF approach was used to model the TDM software requirements. The associated TAF tools generated tests that identified a potential TDM fault. 1...|$|R

5|$|According to a MinnPost poll, Minnesotans {{blamed the}} Republican {{legislature}} more for <b>the</b> <b>shutdown.</b> Overall, 42% said Republicans {{in the legislature}} were more responsible, 21% said the DFL governor was more responsible, and 22% volunteered an answer that they were equally to blame. As expected, partisans blamed the other party more; only 10% of Republicans blamed the legislature more, and only 2% of DFLers blamed Dayton more. Following <b>the</b> <b>shutdown,</b> DFL Representative Phyllis Kahn authored a continuing appropriations bill that would prevent government shutdowns {{in the event of}} disagreements between the governor and legislature, as she had done in several past sessions. The House commissioned a policy brief from its research department, published in December 2011, that looked into what such a bill would require. The brief noted that such ideas had been considered before, including after the 2005 shutdown, and had been abandoned.|$|E

Findings suggest that the Republican Congress was blamed more for <b>the</b> <b>shutdowns</b> and received more negative audio and visual attributions than the President. Findings suggest that while the networks presented <b>the</b> <b>shutdowns</b> through more strategy than issue frames, a human-interest frame was identified as a dominant theme throughout the coverage. Results did not support the hypothesized relationship between frames and visual images.
