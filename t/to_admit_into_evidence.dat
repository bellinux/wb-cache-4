Although MacDonald’s lawyers, Bernard Segal and Wade Smith, were confident of an acquittal {{from the first}} day, one thing after another went badly for the defense. It began when Dupree refused a defense request <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>into</b> <b>evidence</b> a psychiatric evaluation of MacDonald, which suggested that someone of his personality type was unable to kill his family. Dupree explained that since no insanity plea had been entered for MacDonald, {{he did not want}} the trial bogged down by contradictory psychiatric testimony from prosecution and defense witnesses.|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} of Palmer v.

40|$|When {{aviation}} accidents occur, the National Transportation Safety Board conducts {{an investigation}} {{to determine the}} conditions, circumstances, and ultimately the probable cause of the accident. There is a federal statutory privilege which renders these reports, as well as testimony from the attending investigator, inadmissible as evidence in any suit or action arising from the accident. However, certain judicially created exceptions have arisen which permit portions of the report and certain investigator testimony <b>to</b> be <b>admitted</b> <b>into</b> <b>evidence.</b> The authors delineate and analyze these exceptions as they discuss the trend toward increased report and testimony admissibility. The authors conclude with a recommended statutory revision which would set out a predictable and consistent scheme for determining admissibility of National Transportation Safety Board aviation accident reports and testimony from the investigators who prepared them...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in brain imaging technologies allow researchers to 2 ̆ 2 peer inside 2 ̆ 2 a defendant 2 ̆ 7 s brain. Although functional neuroimaging evidence is frequently used in civil litigation, federal courts have been hesitant <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> it <b>into</b> <b>evidence</b> in criminal trials.

Meanwhile, federal judges repeatedly admit various forms of forensic science <b>into</b> <b>evidence</b> without evaluating them under the appropriate admissibility standards. This Note argues that this has created a double standard for evidence admissibility. Functional neuroimaging evidence may, in fact, be more scientifically reliable {{than some of the}} forensic science evidence currently admitted at trial. Accordingly, this Note proposes that judges should consider the disparity in evidentiary standards when considering the admissibility of functional neuroimaging evidence, and should carefully and fairly examine such evidence when proffered in federal criminal trials...|$|R
500|$|Conservative Melbourne lawyer Peter Faris QC {{called for}} {{an appeal to the}} High Court or changes to the laws of [...] {{evidence}} legislation, saying that [...] "this case is bad law", alternatively suggesting that Thomas be handed over to Pakistan, since he stated that the evidence from the interview would in his opinion be admissible in a Pakistani court. Faris also argued that there was an issue of apparent bias arising with respect to the presiding judge in the appeal, Maxwell P, which could afford grounds for invalidating the appeal. It should be noted, however, that Pakistani law of evidence does not permit a confession made to a police officer <b>to</b> be <b>admitted</b> <b>into</b> <b>evidence.</b> Faris argued that the apparent bias arose because of Maxwell's activities before his appointment to the Supreme Court of Victoria, including his membership of organisations including Amnesty International, his past presidency of Liberty Victoria, his past involvement with human rights law and advocacy against counter-terrorism laws. Faris drew a comparison with the House of Lords case which considered the extradition of Augusto Pinochet, which was overturned on appeal because of Lord Hoffman's failure to disclose his links to Amnesty International.|$|R
40|$|Law {{enforcement}} personnel {{have increasingly}} employed hypnotists to aid their criminal investigations. Under hypnosis, {{a witness who}} cannot remember a traumatic criminal encounter can be helped to resurrect the emotionally suppressed recall. Unfortunately, due to {{the inability of the}} hypnotic process to produce consistently reliable results, courts have expressed a reluctance <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> these memories <b>into</b> <b>evidence.</b> This comment examines how various jurisdictions have chosen to address the accuracy problems associated with hypno-enhanced memories. The article begins with a historical sketch of the treatment accorded hypnosis in related cases, and discusses the merit of each approach. Concluding that none of these judicial strategies has effectively resolved the issue, the author offers a novel approach aimed at finding a more appropriate resolution of the hypnosis controversy...|$|R

40|$|From {{the first}} English {{settlement}} in colonial America {{to the beginning}} of the Revolution, the legal status of account books evolved. During this period, there was a scarcity of hard currency which made commercial transactions largely dependent upon a credit based, barter based economic system. Business transactions often were represented by book debt. As merchants brought legal actions over book debt disputes, American colonial courts and legislatures began to examine the English common law rules that placed several restrictions on the introduction of account books <b>into</b> <b>evidence.</b> Responding to economic and social necessity, colonial America developed a legal system that was more flexible and pragmatic than was the English system in regard <b>to</b> <b>admitting</b> account books <b>into</b> <b>evidence.</b> Thus, American colonial courts and legislatures met the commercial needs of the new world, and in so doing, provided the impetus for examining accounting standards, fiduciary duty and financial statements in today’s American legal system...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the objects}} of the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act, Act 25 of 2002 (the ECT Act), is to enable and {{facilitate}} electronic communications and transactions for purposes of promoting legal certainty. It is submitted that Section 15 (4) of the ECT Act has in contrast, created more legal uncertainty. Section 15 (4) of the ECT Act, seeks <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> data messages <b>into</b> <b>evidence</b> on its mere production in any legal proceedings and attaches an evidential weight to such data messages, namely that it constitutes rebuttable proof of the facts contained therein. This study focuses on the interpretation of both the admissibility and evidential weight attached to data messages within the specific context of section 15 (4) of the ECT Act. A literature study will be undertaken and it is concluded that section 15 (4) of the ECT Act, as it stands, is {{a departure from the}} Model Law on which the ECT Act is based and has neither been effectively applied in our South African courts nor, in certain instances, correctly interpreted.

5000|$|The Confrontation Clause {{relates to}} the common law rule {{preventing}} the admission of hearsay, that is to say, testimony by one witness as to the statements and observations of another person {{to prove that the}} statement or observation was accurate. The rationale was that the defendant had no opportunity to challenge the credibility of and cross-examine the person making the statements. Certain exceptions to the hearsay rule have been permitted; for instance, admissions by the defendant are admissible, as are dying declarations. Nevertheless, in California v. Green, , the Supreme Court has held that the hearsay rule {{is not the same as}} the Confrontation Clause. Hearsay is admissible under certain circumstances. For example, in Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123 (1968), the Supreme Court ruled that while a defendant's out of court statements were admissible in proving the defendant's guilt, they were inadmissible hearsay against another defendant. Hearsay may, in some circumstances, be admitted though it is not covered by one of the long-recognized exceptions. For example, prior testimony may sometimes be admitted if the witness is unavailable. However, in Crawford v. Washington, , the Supreme Court increased the scope of the Confrontation Clause by ruling that [...] "testimonial" [...] out-of-court statements are inadmissible if the accused did not have the opportunity to cross-examine that accuser and that accuser is unavailable at trial. In Davis v. Washington , the Court ruled that [...] "testimonial" [...] refers to any statement that an objectively reasonable person in the declarant's situation would believe likely to be used in court. In Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. ___ (2009), and Bullcoming v. New Mexico, 564 U.S. ___ (2011), the Court ruled that admitting a lab chemist's analysis <b>into</b> <b>evidence,</b> without having him testify, violated the Confrontation Clause. In Michigan v. Bryant, 562 U.S. ___ (2011), the Court ruled that the [...] "primary purpose" [...] of a shooting victim's statement as to who shot him, and the police's reason for questioning him, each had to be objectively determined. If the [...] "primary purpose" [...] was for dealing with an [...] "ongoing emergency", then any such statement was not testimonial and so the Confrontation Clause would not require the person making that statement to testify in order for that statement <b>to</b> be <b>admitted</b> <b>into</b> <b>evidence.</b>|$|R

40|$|One night, in {{the hours}} just before daybreak, the {{computer}} servers at Acme Corporation 2 ̆ 7 s headquarters quietly hum {{in the silence of}} the office 2 ̆ 7 s darkened hallways. Suddenly, they waken to life and begin haphazardly sifting through their files. Several states away, a hacker sits in his room, searching through the mainframe via an internet connection. His attack is quick-lasting only a short five minutes-but the evidence of invasion is apparent to Acme 2 ̆ 7 s IT employees when they come in to work the next morning. Nearly a year later, federal prosecutors bring suit in the federal district court against the person they believe to be the hacker. During the trial, several witnesses testify about the attack and its resulting damage. The only piece missing is the hacker 2 ̆ 7 s identity. In order to prove this, the prosecution wishes to introduce the mainframe 2 ̆ 7 s records of the attack, which document both the source of the invasion and the signature of the computer that conducted the entire event. A cursory check by computer specialists matched these records with the accused hacker 2 ̆ 7 s personal computer. The prosecutors lay sufficient foundation to authenticate the records and then move <b>to</b> have them <b>admitted</b> <b>into</b> <b>evidence.</b> 2 ̆ 2 Objection! 2 ̆ 2 states the defense counsel. 2 ̆ 2 On what grounds? 2 ̆ 2 replies the judge. 2 ̆ 2 Hearsay, your Honor. The computer records the prosecution is attempting to introduce do not satisfy the business records exception under Federal Rule of Evidence 803 (6). They were created in response to an attack, and were not maintained in the ordinary course of business. Consequently, they cannot be admitted under the Rules of Evidence and must be deemed inadmissible. 2 ̆ 2 The judge directs his attention to the prosecution. 2 ̆ 2 Counsel, are there any other exceptions these records fall under? 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 No, your Honor. 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Objection sustained. 2 ̆ 2 This result may seem inequitable, but it is entirely possible given the current majority view on the nature of computer-generated records. This Note argues that the minority conception is the proper approach to judging computer-generated records 2 ̆ 7 admissibility. The minority approach recognizes the true nature of this type of record and is in accordance with the overall purposes of the Federal Rules of Evidence: accuracy and truth in the fact-finding process. Part I demonstrates that a distinction exists between computer-stored and computer-generated records. A majority of courts largely ignore this distinction despite contravening precedent from several state courts. Part II then explains why computer-generated records as opposed to computer-stored records-should not be considered hearsay because these records do not fit into the definition of hearsay and they do not present the normal dangers associated with such statements. Part III advocates a test by which judges can distinguish between these two types of records. This Part also suggests ways in which federal and state judiciaries can reform faulty precedent and avoid the likely obstacles that will arise in such an endeavor...|$|R
