5|$|After the war, Teaneck {{returned}} {{to being a}} quiet farm community. Fruits and vegetables grown locally were taken by wagon to markets in nearby Paterson and New York City. New growth and development were spurred in the mid-19th century by the establishment of railroads throughout the area. Wealthy New Yorkers and others purchased large properties on which they built spacious mansions and manor houses. <b>They</b> <b>traveled</b> daily to work in New York City, thus becoming Teaneck's first suburban commuters.|$|E
5|$|Coffin {{continued}} to farm {{after moving to}} Indiana and {{within a year of}} his arrival he opened the first dry-goods store in Newport. In later years Coffin credited the success of his business, which he expanded in the 1830s, with providing him the ability to become heavily involved in the costly enterprise of the Underground Railroad, a costly and risky enterprise that provided a network of stopover sites for fugitive slaves as <b>they</b> <b>traveled</b> north into Canada.|$|E

5|$|Dayton {{was founded}} on April 1, 1796, by 12 {{settlers}} known as the Thompson Party. <b>They</b> <b>traveled</b> in March from Cincinnati up the Great Miami River by pirogue and landed at what is now St. Clair Street, where they found two small camps of Native Americans. Among the Thompson Party was Benjamin Van Cleve, whose memoirs provide insights into the Ohio Valley's history. Two other groups traveling overland arrived several days later.|$|E
5|$|During {{their time}} in Africa, Krapf and Rebmann worked {{their way into the}} {{interior}} of the continent. <b>They</b> <b>traveled</b> to several areas in the regions of Central and Eastern Africa, including to what is now known as the African Great Lakes. The finding of one especially large lake (Uniamési) is depicted in a map known as the 'Slug' map. It was known by this name because the layout of the water body suggested a shape similar to that of a slug.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile Erika 'Rika' Wallen, born Lovisa Erika Jakobson in 1874 on a {{farm near}} Örebro Sweden, immigrated with her sister in 1891 to the United States. <b>They</b> <b>traveled</b> to Minneapolis, Minnesota to join their brother Carl Jakobson. There they changed their last name to Wallen to {{distinguish}} themselves from the many other Jacobsons and Jakobsons. After Carl died in an accident, the sisters moved to San Francisco, which they heard was booming. Rika {{took a job as}} a cook for the Hills Brothers coffee family, which lasted until the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.|$|E

5|$|The Rose company left Iowa in April; <b>they</b> <b>traveled</b> to Kansas City, Missouri, then named Westport, {{which they}} reached via {{steamboat}} across the Missouri River. In mid-May, {{they were joined}} by the Baley company while resting at Cottonwood Creek, near present-day Durham, Kansas. In the interests of safety, the groups agreed to an informal merger; their combined outfits numbered twenty wagons, forty men, fifty to sixty women and children, and nearly five hundred head of unbranded cattle.|$|E
5|$|The {{family left}} The Hague {{at the end}} of March, moving first to Haarlem, where the organist of St Bavo's Church invited Wolfgang to play on the church's organ, {{one of the largest in}} the country. From there <b>they</b> <b>traveled</b> east and south, giving concerts along the way at Amsterdam and Utrecht at 21 April, before leaving the Netherlands and {{traveling}} through Brussels and Valenciennes, to arrive in Paris on 10 May.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} month <b>they</b> <b>traveled</b> east, hoping {{to locate the}} Mississippi and return to Canada. During their travels, the group encountered the Caddo, who gave the Frenchmen a map depicting their territory, that of their neighbors, {{and the location of}} the Mississippi River. The Caddo often made friendship pacts with neighboring peoples and extended their policy of peaceful negotiation to the French. While visiting the Caddo, the French met Jumano traders, who reported on the activities of the Spanish in New Mexico. These traders later informed Spanish officials of the Frenchmen they had seen.|$|E

5|$|The {{imperial}} party {{arrived in}} Rio Grande do Sul's capital, Porto Alegre, in July 1865. From there, <b>they</b> <b>traveled</b> inland {{until they reached}} Uruguaiana in September. This Brazilian town was occupied by a Paraguayan army. By the time Caxias and his party arrived, the town was under siege by a combined force of Brazilian, Argentine and Uruguayan units.

5|$|Urey and Murphy {{calculated}} from the Debye model that the heavy isotope would have a slightly higher boiling point than the light one. By carefully warming liquid hydrogen, 5 litres of liquid hydrogen could be distilled to 1 millilitre, which would be enriched in the heavy isotope by 100 to 200 times. To obtain five litres of liquid hydrogen, <b>they</b> <b>traveled</b> to the cryogenics laboratory at the National Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C., where they obtained the help of Ferdinand Brickwedde, whom Urey had known at Johns Hopkins.|$|E
5|$|After {{travelling}} to the Himalaya {{the first}} time, the Workmans became entranced with climbing and mountaineering. Over {{a span of}} 14 years, <b>they</b> <b>traveled</b> eight times to the area, {{which at the time}} was almost completely unexplored and unmapped. Their trips were made without the benefit of modern lightweight equipment, freeze-dried foods, sunblock, or radios. On each expedition, they explored, surveyed, and photographed, ultimately reporting on their findings and creating maps. The couple shared and alternated responsibilities; one year Fanny would organize the logistics of their journey and William would work on the scientific projects and the next year they would reverse roles.|$|E

5|$|An {{exception}} {{was made for}} Christians to participate in Christmas ceremonies in Bethlehem. Some sources claim Jews could only visit the wall if <b>they</b> <b>traveled</b> through Jordan (which {{was not an option}} for Israelis) and did not have an Israeli visa stamped in their passports. Only Jordanian soldiers and tourists were to be found there. A vantage point on Mount Zion, from which the Wall could be viewed, became the place where Jews gathered to pray. For thousands of pilgrims, the mount, being the closest location to the Wall under Israeli control, became a substitute site for the traditional priestly blessing ceremony which takes place on the Three Pilgrimage Festivals.|$|E
5|$|At 10:30 pm, {{the crowd}} became violent after an {{individual}} threw a bottle off a roof {{into the crowd}} aggregated about the hospital. The group dispersed into gangs containing between 50–100 members. The gangs first broke windows of white businesses as <b>they</b> <b>traveled</b> through Harlem: if the mob was told the business was owned by blacks, they left it alone. If it was owned by whites, the store would be looted and vandalized. Rioters broke streetlights and threw white mannequins onto the ground. In grocery stores, the rioters took war-scarce items, such as coffee and sugar; clothing, and liquor; and furniture stores were also looted. Estimates put the total monetary damage between $250,000–$5,000,000, which included 1,485 stores burglarized and 4,495 windows broken.|$|E
5|$|At Remagen the 47th Regiment {{was given}} the mission of {{guarding}} the Ludendorff Bridge over the Rhine River. Twenty five years later the 47th would once again guard this bridge during World War II. The regiment remained here until given orders to return home in mid-summer 1919. Before his departure from Europe, Middleton was summoned {{to report to the}} Third Army Chief of Staff in Koblenz. Here he was informed that he and other senior officers were being assigned to Camp Benning, Georgia to form the first faculty of the Infantry School that was being established there. Middleton sailed out of Brest in mid-July, met his wife in New York, and together <b>they</b> <b>traveled</b> to Columbus, Georgia by way of Washington, D.C. and Atlanta.|$|E
50|$|A vehicle miles {{traveled}} tax, {{also frequently}} {{referred to as}} a VMT tax, VMT fee, mileage-based fee, or road user charge, is a policy of charging motorists based on how many miles <b>they</b> have <b>traveled.</b>|$|R

60|$|Next {{morning they}} started again, with fifteen loaves {{done up in}} a blanket {{on one of the}} ponies. The journey was toilsome, for the river ran in places through gorges where the rocks rose sheer from its edge, and they were forced to make {{considerable}} detours, and to come down upon it again. <b>They</b> had <b>traveled,</b> <b>they</b> calculated, but eight miles up the stream, when they came upon a valley running east. A small stream ran down it, and fell into the river they were following.|$|R
5|$|Charles Harmison's {{older brother}} {{had moved to}} Romney, where he {{established}} and operated a hotel (the Virginia House). In 1867, the brother learned that the Parsons farm was for sale, and he advised Charles to buy it. Charles' wife, who wanted to live nearer to Virginia, also urged her husband to buy the property. Charles did, and he, his wife, their (then) seven children and a young African American boy named Snoden moved from Harrison to Hampshire County in three days. <b>They</b> <b>traveled</b> on the Northwestern Turnpike in an ambulance Charles had bought after the war. Influenced by her childhood home and by its view of the South Branch Potomac River valley, Elizabeth Harmison named their new house and farm Valley View.|$|E
5|$|Dartmouth College fielded {{its first}} {{football}} team in 1881, {{when the school}} challenged Amherst College to a two-game series. They won the first contest, one touchdown to none, and tied the second. The following year, the team played their first major opponent when <b>they</b> <b>traveled</b> to Cambridge, Massachusetts and played the Harvard Crimson. Dartmouth was blown out 53–0, and a rivalry with Harvard formed. The Dartmouth football team developed through the 1880s, skipping the 1885 season but challenging several major opponents. Prior to Wurtenburg's arrival, the school had won four Triangular Football League championships in seven years. Wallace Moyle was the first coach hired by the program; he served in that position during the two years before Wurtenburg's appointment and led the school to a 9–7 record.|$|E
