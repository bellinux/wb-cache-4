5|$|Verses 1–10 of chapter 8 {{elaborate}} on the practice of Dharana or meditation to train the mind in <b>the</b> <b>consciousness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> self. The five elements in the universe correspond to five body functional systems, and that systems are gods residing within the human body. The next level of meditation is to fix one's undistracted attention to these five, while simultaneously performing the breath exercises mastered in the previous step.|$|E
5|$|As {{the police}} chase the rapidly {{transforming}} Carroon across London, Quatermass analyses {{samples of the}} mutated creature in a laboratory, and realises that it {{has the ability to}} end all life on Earth if it spores. A television crew working on an architectural programme locates the monster in Westminster Abbey, and Quatermass and troops of the British Army rush in to destroy it in the hour before it brings about doomsday. Quatermass convinces <b>the</b> <b>consciousness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three crewmen buried deep inside the creature to turn against it and destroy it; this appeal to the last remains of their humanity succeeds in defeating the organism.|$|E
5|$|Carroon, gravely ill, is {{cared for}} by the Rocket Group's doctor, Briscoe (John Glen), who has been having a secret affair with Carroon's wife, Judith (Isabel Dean). It is not just Quatermass who is {{interested}} in what happened to Carroon and his crewmates; journalists such as James Fullalove (Paul Whitsun-Jones) and Scotland Yard's Inspector Lomax (Ian Colin) are also keen to hear his story. Carroon is abducted {{by a group of}} foreign agents whose government wants the information they believe he has obtained about travelling in space. It is clear that there is something critically wrong: he appears to have absorbed <b>the</b> <b>consciousness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other two crew members, and is slowly mutating into a plant-like alien organism.|$|E

40|$|Quantum {{computation}} {{has been}} proposed to generate <b>consciousness.</b> <b>The</b> terms atman field and consciousness vector have also been used to describe <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> It has also been proposed that the human activities should lead to increase in <b>the</b> magnitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>consciousness</b> vector <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universe. The universe is increasingly being seen as one system and the earth is a constituent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universe.

25|$|By {{the late}} 1920s, the {{conflict}} began to {{pass into the}} realm of oral tradition in Minnesota.

25|$|Even {{now there}} lingers in <b>the</b> <b>consciousness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old, sharper {{divisions}} which the ages {{had not been}} able to efface, and which is strong enough to find—not only here and there—expression as antipathy to the Jewish type. In France, that let down the barriers more than a hundred years ago, the feeling of antipathy is still strong enough to sustain an anti-Jewish political party.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> effects <b>of</b> {{corporate}} environmentalism or self-regulation {{are examined}} in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> strategic environmental and trade policies. An environmentally conscious home firm competes {{with a private}} profit maximizing foreign firm in a third-country market. <b>The</b> production <b>of</b> goods causes pollution. The home and the foreign governments non-cooperatively set emission taxes and export subsidies. It is shown that if pollution is purely local or <b>the</b> environmental <b>consciousness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> home firm is weak, <b>the</b> environmental <b>consciousness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> home firm has no effects on welfare and pollution. If pollution is at least partially transboudary and <b>the</b> environmental <b>consciousness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> home firm is sufficiently strong, home welfare is lower compared to the case where the home firm is the profit maximizer. Moreover, a symmetric reduction in export subsidies {{may not be in}} <b>the</b> interest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> home country because it may reduce home welfare by shifting rents from the home to the foreign country...|$|R

25|$|Andorra {{participated in}} <b>the</b> {{cultural}} movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Catalan Renaixença.

25|$|Miller {{is known}} for <b>the</b> <b>consciousness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{characters}} in his play. In his plays, he confronts a level of banality with the roller coaster of guilt and responsibility. Some strong examples of characters who portray this struggle between their conscious and their social responsibility are Joe Keller in All My Sons and John Proctor in The Crucible. Miller often creates consequences for characters who ignore or violate their social responsibilities.|$|E
25|$|Meher Baba {{has used}} the term {{involution}} to describe the inner journey of consciousness after transcending the physical or gross state up to the attainment of Self-consciousness, or merging with God. According to Meher Baba, <b>the</b> <b>consciousness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soul in duality first goes through the long process of evolution of form, then, upon reaching the human form, consciousness enters the process of reincarnation, and finally reaches the process of involution, which culminates in God-realization.|$|E
25|$|Self-consciousness and <b>the</b> <b>consciousness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{apparent}} universe do not end {{after the}} dissolution of the ego and several chapters of the book are dedicated to the states of consciousness gained by those who have transcended the ego. Also, most chapters of the book get into particular practices for the emancipation of consciousness from the ego, qualities that have to be developed by the individual, and examine important issues that have to be confronted in the process.|$|E

25|$|Bakhtin’s {{notion of}} {{carnival}} {{is connected with}} that of the grotesque. In the carnival, usual social hierarchies and proprieties are upended; emphasis is placed on the body in its open dimension, in its connection {{to the life of the}} community. This emphasis on the material dimension which links humans, rather than on the differences and separations between them, allows for <b>the</b> <b>consciousness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historical dimension of human life: for every death, there is a birth, a renewal of the human spirit. This process allows for progress.|$|E
25|$|To {{avoid the}} {{unhappiness}} of aimless desire, the Will realizes the ideas already potentially {{present and the}} Unconscious becomes actual.

It is {{the best of all possible}} worlds, which contains the promise of the redemption of the Unconscious from actual existence by the exercise of Reason in partnership with the Will in <b>the</b> <b>consciousness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enlightened pessimist.|$|E

25|$|The need {{to create}} a working-class culture and a counter-hegemony relates to Gramsci's call for a kind of {{education}} that could develop working-class intellectuals, whose task was not to introduce Marxist ideology into <b>the</b> <b>consciousness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proletariat as a set of foreign notions, but to renovate the existing intellectual activity of the masses and make it natively critical of the status quo. His ideas about an education system for this purpose correspond with the notion of critical pedagogy and popular education as theorized and practised in later decades by Paulo Freire in Brazil, and have much in common with the thought of Frantz Fanon. For this reason, partisans of adult and popular education consider Gramsci an important voice to this day.|$|E

In spite of the great victories in Armenia and in Azerbaijan, Turkey was now in an indefensible condition, which could not be remedied with the resources on hand. It was also apparent that the disintegration of the Bulgarian Army at Salonika and the dissolution of the Austro–Hungarian Army spelled disaster and defeat for the Central Powers. From now until the Armistice, the focus of the Turkish strategy would be to retain as much Ottoman territory as possible.|$|E
25|$|Eclecticism is {{not open}} to the {{superficial}} objection of proceeding without a system or test in determining the complete or incomplete. But it is open to objection, assuming that a particular analysis of consciousness has reached all the possible elements in humanity and in history, and all their combinations. It may be asked, Can history have that which {{is not in the}} individual consciousness? In a sense not; but our analysis may not give all that is there, and we ought not at once to impose that analysis or any formula on history. History is as likely to reveal to us in the first place true and original elements, and combinations of elements in man, as a study of consciousness. Besides, the tendency of applying a formula of this sort to history is to assume that the elements are developed in a certain regular or necessary order, whereas this may not at all be the case; but we may find at any epoch the whole mixed, either crossing or co-operative, as in <b>the</b> <b>consciousness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual himself. Further, the question as to how these elements may possibly have grown up in the general consciousness of mankind is assumed to be nonexistent or impossible.|$|E
50|$|Coexistence between Tats and Azerbaijanis have {{combined}} much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two cultures.
