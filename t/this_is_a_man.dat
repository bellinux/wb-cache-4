25|$|Levi wrote If <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Man</b> to {{bear witness}} to the horrors of the Nazis' attempt to exterminate the Jewish people and others.

25|$|Levi {{began writing}} The Truce early in 1961; it was {{published}} in 1963, almost 16 years after his first book. That year it won the first annual Premio Campiello literary award. It is often published in one volume with If <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Man,</b> as it covers his long return through eastern Europe from Auschwitz. Levi's reputation was growing. He regularly contributed articles to , the Turin newspaper. He worked to gain a reputation as a writer about subjects other than survival of Auschwitz.|$|E
25|$|In 1958 Stuart Woolf, {{in close}} {{collaboration}} with Levi, translated If <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Man</b> into English, {{and it was}} published in the UK in 1959 by Orion Press. Also in 1959 Heinz Riedt, also under close supervision by Levi, translated it into German. As one of Levi's primary reasons for writing the book was to get the German people to realise what had been done in their name, and to accept at least partial responsibility, this translation was perhaps the most significant to him.|$|E
25|$|On 21 January 1946 {{he started}} work at DUCO, a Du Pont Company paint factory outside Turin. Because of the {{extremely}} limited train service, Levi {{stayed in the}} factory dormitory during the week. This gave {{him the opportunity to}} write undisturbed. He started to write the first draft of If <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Man.</b> Every day he scribbled notes on train tickets and scraps of paper as memories came to him. At the end of February, he had ten pages detailing the last ten days between the German evacuation and the arrival of the Red Army. For the next ten months, the book took shape in his dormitory as he typed up his recollections each night.|$|E

He achieved {{so much in}} those seventy years {{that it is impossible}} for any short account of his life and work to be comprehensive. The following overview is therefore necessarily selective and, to avoid duplication, I have passed quickly over those aspects of Alan's career emphasized by Ron Cohen, but I hope that it covers the ground reasonably. systematically and at least hits the highlights of a remarkable, indeed quite extraordinary, story. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> whose like we shall not often see again...|$|R

Here we report the first documented and pathology proven case of Organizing Pneumonia complicating treatment with Pembrolizumab. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who presented with a dense lung consolidation four months following treatment with Pembrolizumab. A thorough microbiological workup was negative and his findings did not improve with broad spectrum anti-microbial treatment. Transbronchial biopsy revealed organizing pneumonia, and treatment with cortico-steroids resulted in complete resolution of clinical and radiological disease. This report highlights the importance of recognizing immune related adverse events, specifically pulmonary inflammation, in patients receiving treatment with novel immune-modulating agents...|$|R
50|$|By {{the late}} 14th century the Bishop of Durham {{appears to have}} no longer used the Castle as a {{residence}} and the buildings and land were let out at first to his bailiff. By 1509 <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> named John Hall who enjoyed a lease of 31 years. The castle and deer park passed {{through a number of}} hands over the following centuries including the Eure family of Witton Castle, the Freville's and by the 18th century the Surtees family which included the notable historian Robert Surtees, who lived nearby at Mainsforth and wrote on the village and Castle in his History of Durham in 1823.

500|$|... "Triangle" [...] is also {{notable for}} {{featuring}} the first kiss between Mulder and Scully. In a positive critique, Kerry Fall from DVD Journal {{wrote that the}} entry was made particularly notable, in and of itself, due {{to the presence of}} the kiss. Kessenich opined that the kiss built off [...] "the seeds that were planted in the movie ... Scully clearly believes <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> lost in delirium, but Mulder ... is finally beginning to deal with some pretty powerful feelings he has for his partner." [...] Paula Vitaris, on the other hand, was frustrated; she complained [...] "hen are these kisses that are not kisses going to end?" ...|$|E
25|$|In his Church History, Eusebius {{records that}} the writer of <b>this</b> gospel <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> named Mark who was Peter’s interpreter.

His funeral service was attended by Michael Jackson, Harry Wayne Casey, Jennifer Valoppi and Nat Kipner. Valoppi, a family friend said, [...] "It was emotional, there was humor. Everybody talked about how <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who really celebrated life and so <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> celebration of his life." [...] Gibb's ex-wife Lulu was reported to have attended his funeral. Kipner, who managed the early Bee Gees career in Australia in 1966 spoke fondly of his memories: [...] "But I had a business in Australia and I didn't want to go. So I gave them their contract back. One of the dumb things I've done", he joked.|$|R
500|$|Mendes had Spacey and Bening in {{mind for}} the leads from the beginning, but DreamWorks {{executives}} were unenthusiastic. The studio suggested several alternatives, including Bruce Willis, Kevin Costner, or John Travolta to play Lester, and Helen Hunt or Holly Hunter to play Carolyn. Mendes did not want a big star [...] "weighing the film down"; he felt Spacey was the right choice based on his performances in the 1995 films The Usual Suspects and Seven, and 1992's Glengarry Glen Ross. Spacey was surprised; he said, [...] "I usually play characters who are very quick, very manipulative and smart. [...] I usually wade in dark, sort of treacherous waters. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> living {{one step at a}} time, playing by his instincts. This is actually much closer to me, to what I am, than those other parts." [...] Mendes offered Bening the role of Carolyn without the studio's consent; although executives were upset at Mendes, by September 1998, DreamWorks had entered negotiations with Spacey and Bening.|$|E
500|$|When {{it became}} public in early 2005 {{that the book}} would be published, representatives of Morrison {{contacted}} the publishers of the book. Said Rogan to The Irish Times: [...] "There has been contact with the publishers, I know that much. When the news broke {{earlier this year that}} the book was being published, his lawyers asked to see an advance copy of the manuscript. The publishers refused the request. But then <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who when he learnt {{that there was going to}} be a plaque erected outside his former Belfast home, got his solicitors to write to the Belfast Telegraph dissociating himself from the tribute." [...] The book was first published in 2005 by Secker & Warburg, and a 2006 edition was published by Vintage Books. Johnny Rogan appeared on a panel of experts in the 2008 documentary Van Morrison: Under Review 1964–1974, along with Steve Turner, author of the 1993 biography [...]|$|E
500|$|Morrison's lyrics on Moondance {{deal with}} themes of spiritual renewal and redemption. It {{departed}} from Astral Weeks discursive, stream-of-consciousness narratives as the singer balanced his spiritual ideas with more worldly subject matter, which biographer Johnny Rogan felt offered the record {{a quality of}} [...] "earthiness". As a counterpart to Astral Weeks, AllMusic critic Jason Ankeny believed it [...] "retains the previous album's deeply spiritual thrust but transcends its bleak, cathartic intensity" [...] by rejoicing in [...] "natural wonder". According to Christgau, the essence of Morrison's spirit was, much like the African-American music that inspired him, [...] "mortal and immortal simultaneously: <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who gets stoned on {{a drink of water}} and urges us to turn up our radios all the way into the mystic." [...] His [...] "giddy" [...] preoccupation with [...] "natural wonder" [...] on the album was a product of the new approach to composition and the mellow feel of his new band, Harrington said. In his opinion, the record's exuberant spirit and theme of self-affirmation were partly inspired by the singer having [...] "settled into a life of domestic bliss". Musicologist Brian Hinton argued that Morrison was celebrating a [...] "natural alternative" [...] in his music after quitting soft drugs around this time because they had impeded his productivity.|$|E

500|$|In {{writing the}} script, the Breaking Bad staff decided {{early on that}} Gus would not speak much during the scene because they felt it was more {{dramatic}} that way and more appropriate for his character. Esposito felt the scene was a pivotal moment not only for his character, but for Gus' relationship with Walter, and a warning that Walter should continue to operate Gus' way or risk death. Regarding his character's murder of Victor, Esposito said: [...] "This had to be done. Someone did something, they got seen. ... It was about survival. This had to be done, but I {{could do it in}} a way that also sent a message to the people who weren't listening." [...] Bryan Cranston said he was not expecting the episode to take the direction it did. He called the scene [...] "painful, but beautifully crafted, and reasonably so", and commented on the contrast between Gus' calm demeanor and Walter's [...] "tap-dancing to stay alive". Cranston said of Esposito's performance, [...] "When he plays that bad character, his eyes go dead, and all it takes is to look into his eyes." [...] Gilligan said although Gus' actions in the scene were scripted, [...] "You'd be surprised how little I talked to Giancarlo about how he played that part ... <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> with amazing instincts." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2006, Feinstein {{confirmed}} {{she would}} vote against Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito, though disagreed with filibustering the choice: [...] "When {{it comes to}} filibustering a Supreme Court appointment, {{you really have to}} have something out there, whether it's gross moral turpitude or something that comes to the surface. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> I might disagree with, (but) that doesn't mean he shouldn't be on the court." ...|$|E
2500|$|Agunah ( [...] , plural: agunot (עגונות); {{literally}} [...] "anchored" [...] or [...] "chained") is a halachic {{term for}} a Jewish woman who is [...] "chained" [...] to her marriage.

Their law firm was located in rue de l'ancienne poste, between the Street of Maltese and Avenue of France. He then lived in Street of Résevoir where he rented an apartment with 300 francs per month. As for Bourguiba, [...] "Nothing mattered. What was necessary over all was to <b>be</b> domiciled in <b>a</b> law office holder {{for the duration of the}} regulatory internship. However, Bourguiba quickly acquired an annoying renowned for his bosses: [...] "It was impossible to continue working with <b>this</b> Bourguiba! <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> the law firm hired for an internship and there he is, stealing customers!". They soon informed him that he had no longer the responsibility of pleadings, henceforth the charge of Mr. Zérah. Bourguiba, instead was charged in writing works.
