No. 72351. According to historian D.M Leeson, Bruce claimed to have had a [...] "private grudge against Sinn Fein". He was appointed Platoon Commander of No. 3 Platoon in [...] "A" [...] Company, which was the first Company formed while the Division was still in Quarters at the Curragh Army Camp in Co. Kildare. In September 1920, [...] "A" [...] Company was posted to Inistioge, Co. Kilkenny and shortly afterwards, an incident occurred and Bruce was accused of assaulting a civilian and forced to resign. According to Brig. General Crozier, the Commanding Officer of the <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Division,</b> Bruce was dismissed as unsuitable for the <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Division,</b> for striking a civilian without cause. However, Historian and author, D.M Leeson comments that {{in the light of the}} murders and violence that were occurring in Ireland up to this time, Bruce's offence seems relatively mild, but nevertheless it still ended his career in the <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Division</b> ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{heart of}} British power in Ireland was the Dublin Castle {{administration}}, often {{known to the}} Irish as [...] "the Castle". The head of the Castle administration was the Lord Lieutenant, to whom a Chief Secretary was responsible, leading—in {{the words of the}} British historian Peter Cottrell—to an [...] "administration renowned for its incompetence and inefficiency". Ireland was divided into three military districts. During the course of the war, two British divisions, the 5th and the 6th, were based in Ireland with their respective headquarters in the Curragh and Cork. By July 1921 there were 50,000 British troops based in Ireland; by contrast there were 14,000 soldiers in metropolitan Britain. The two main police forces in Ireland were the Royal Irish Constabulary (R.I.C) and the Dublin Metropolitan Police. Of the 17,000 policemen in Ireland, 513 were killed by the IRA between 1919-21 while 682 were wounded. Of the R.I.C's senior officers, 60% were Irish Protestants and rest Catholic while 70% of the rank and file of the R.I.C were Irish Catholic with the rest Protestant. The RIC was trained for police work, not war, and was woefully ill-prepared to take on counter-insurgency duties. Until March 1920, London regarded the unrest in Ireland as primarily an issue for the police and did not regard it as a war. The purpose of the Army was to back up the police. During the course of the war, about a quarter of Ireland was put under martial law, mostly in Munster; in rest of the country British authority was not deemed sufficiently threatened to warrant it. During the course of the war, the British created two paramilitary police forces to supplement the work of the R.I.C, recruited mostly from World War I veterans, namely the Temporary Constables (better known as the [...] "Black and Tans") and the <b>Temporary</b> Cadets or <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Division</b> (known as the [...] "Auxies").|$|R
