40|$|Non {{contributory}} periods {{is one of}} the {{key issues}} in the public discussion on the planned reform of the pension system in the Czech Republic and is being widely discussed by economists, social scientists and political representatives. The PhD thesis focuses on a detailed analysis of non-contributory periods in the Czech pension system and their impact on pension system balance and micro and macro economic connections. It includes an international comparison of non contributory periods and a minute description of one selected non contributory period [...] child care in selected European countries. The extent of non contributory periods considered in the pension system represents one of the theoretical possibilities of parametric changes to the pension insurance system. Non contributory periods are taken into account in pension schemes either because the individual is carrying out a non-wage-earning activity beneficial to society or because the individual through no fault of their own finds themselves in an (adverse) social situation which from a humanitarian perspective justifies their participation in pension insurance without making insurance payments. The institution of non contributory periods helps to secure the universality of the pension system, which enables the participation of economically inactive persons in the pension insurance system. The amount of non contributory periods or the proportion between non contributory periods and years worked, or the proportion between paid insurance and non contributory periods (potential loss of insurance contributions) has, to date, merely been estimated in the Czech Republic. This PhD thesis presents the first accurate figures, based on unique individual data on insured persons; methods of analysis, synthesis, comparison, simulations were used and statistical methods were applied. The analysis reveals that non contributory periods are a significant element of the Czech pension system amounting to 22. 4 % of the <b>total</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>period</b> which is unacceptable especially as regards the principle of equivalence. The average duration of non-contributory periods for current pensioners is 8. 7 years. The proportion of hypothetical insurance calculated from the average wage at potential total income from insurance was in the observed year 30 % or 13 % (calculation based on the minimum wage). Non contributory periods in the Czech pension system have a significant impact on its balance. Paying premiums for non contributory periods (included in pension law) would cause a decrease in the contribution rate to 18 % (calculation based on the average wage). If non contributory periods were not considered, the potential savings on pensions paid out would be almost CZK 35 billion in the observed year. That represents 16. 5 % of expenditure on pension payments and more than twice the deficit of the pension insurance account for the observed year. Therefore the author recommends in the thesis the restriction of non contributory periods and the introduction of payments for such non-contributory periods from those people who will be entitled to a pension from such non contributory periods in the future...|$|E

Thus, for example, the pension application for the Austrian or German part is processed very quickly as the domestic insurance file is essentially ready at the time of application, but in Turkey, the process may take many months (for details see Holzmann et al. 2016 a, 2016 b).

40|$|We {{analyze the}} effect of deposit {{insurance}} on the risk-taking behavior of banks {{in the context of}} a quasi-natural experiment using detailed credit registry data. Using the case of an emerging economy, Bolivia, which introduced a deposit insurance system during the sample period, we compare the risk-taking behavior of banks before and after the introduction of this system. We find that in the post-deposit <b>insurance</b> <b>period,</b> banks are more likely to initiate riskier loans (i. e., loans with worse internal ratings at origination). These loans carry higher interest rates and are associated with worse ex-post performance (i. e., they have higher default and delinquency rates). Banks do not seem to compensate for the extra risk by increasing collateral requirements or decreasing loan maturities. We also find evidence that the increase in risk-taking is due to the decrease in market discipline from large depositors. Finally, differences between large (too-big-to-fail) and small banks diminished in the post-deposit <b>insurance</b> <b>period.</b> ...|$|R

I normalize ϵ {{so that it}} is uncorrelated with ν, and assume that the worker is risk-averse (more on this below). As a result, the worker optimally pools the result ν of observed idiosyncratic random factors in a full-information insurance market: when ν is observed he pays it to the insurance group, or receives -ν from the group in case its value is negative. In theory the insurance group is infinitely large and free from administrative costs so that <b>total</b> <b>insurance</b> premiums (from the group members with positive νs) exactly finance <b>total</b> <b>insurance</b> awards (paid to group members with negative νs).

40|$|Can public income {{insurance}} through progressive {{income taxation}} improve {{the allocation of}} risk in an economy where private risk sharing is incomplete? The answer depends crucially on the fundamental friction that limits private risk sharing in the first place. If risk sharing is limited because insurance markets are missing for model-exogenous reasons (as in [8]) publicly provided risk sharing improves on the allocation of risk. If instead private insurance markets exist but their use is limited by limited enforcement (as in [24] then the provision of public insurance interacts with equilibrium private insurance, as, by providing risk sharing, the government affects the value of exclusion from private insurance markets and thus the enforcement mechanism of these contracts. We characterize consumption allocations in an economy with limited enforcement and a continuum of agents facing plausible income risk and tax systems with various degrees of progressivity (public risk sharing).

Since other panel-based unit root tests are joint tests of a unit root for all members of a panel and are incapable of determining the mix of I(0) and I(1) series in a panel setting, the SPSM, proposed by Georgios Chortareas and George Kapetanios (2009), classifies a whole panel into a group of stationary series and a group of non-stationary series. In doing so, we can clearly identify how many and which series in the panel are stationary processes.
