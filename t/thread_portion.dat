40|$|We {{describe}} computation migration, a {{new technique}} {{that is based on}} compile-time program transformations, for accessing remote data in a distributed-memory parallel system. In contrast with RPC-style access, where the access is performed remotely, and with data migration, where the data is moved so that it is local, computation migration moves part of the current thread to the processor where the data resides. The access is performed at the remote processor, and the migrated <b>thread</b> <b>portion</b> continues to run on that same processor; this makes subsequent accesses in the <b>thread</b> <b>portion</b> local. We describe an implementation of computation migration that consists of two parts: an implementation that migrates single activation frames, and a high-level language annotation that allows a programmer to express when migration is desired. We performed experiments using two applications; these experiments demonstrate that computation migration is a valuable alternative to RPC and data migration...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The defects of {{the lower}} tooth height and of larger pitch in <b>thread</b> <b>portion</b> of rolled pieces are prone to {{appearing}} when rolling thread shaft in cross wedge rolling. To solve this problem, changing the blank shape and size were tried. Two types of concave conical and round blanks are designed with concave conical blanks obtained by rolling in the cross wedge rolling. Because {{the design of the}} rolling die is simple, good precision of blank can be ensured. Multiple size types of blanks were designed and the rolling experiment was made in the rolling mill of model H 630. By measuring the values of the tooth height and pitch, the effect of blank shape on thread shafts rolled in the wedge rolling were investigated carefully. The reasonable size range of the blank shape was obtained. The conclusions above pave the theoretical foundation for the in-depth study on this technology...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is to synthesize, {{characterize}} and investigate the properties of [2]rotaxanes and [3]rotaxanes {{for the purposes of}} developing molecular level machines. In {{the first part of the}} thesis the coordination chemistry of the [2]rotaxane 1, 2 -bis(4, 42 ̆ 7 -dipyridinium) ethane/dibenzo- 24 -crown- 8 is investigated. The production of zwitterionic and dizwitterionic [2]rotaxanes produced upon capping with an anionic metal complex is described. The complexes are studied in solution using UV/vis spectroscopy and characterized by X-ray crystallography. The same system, 1, 2 -bis(4, 42 ̆ 7 -dipyridinium) ethane/dibenzo- 24 -crown- 8, is then used for the development of 1 - and 2 -dimensional infinite networks. The networks are characterized by X-ray crystallography and their stability is studied using thermogravimetric analysis. The second part of the thesis focuses on a new class of [2]rotaxanes in which a chelating group has been incorporated into the cationic <b>thread</b> <b>portion.</b> The chelating group is sufficiently bulky making it an adequate stopper. This allows for the incorporation of metal ions in competitive solvents and at high temperature without compromising the integrity of the [2]rotaxanes. The use of a 2, 22 ̆ 7, 62 ̆ 7, 2 ″ -terpyridine unit as the chelating group allowed for investigation of homoleptic iron(II) and heteroleptic ruthenium(II) complexes. The synthesis and characterization of all species using NMR spectroscopy, UV/vis spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X-ray crystallography are described. The final part of this thesis introduces the new concept of flip switching using the 1, 2 -bis(4, 42 ̆ 7 -dipyridinium) ethane/dibenzo- 24 -crown- 8 motif. The synthesis of two model compounds, one with a square planar geometry the other with an octahedral arrangement, is described. These complexes were characterized using standard techniques and investigated for 2 ̆ 7 flipping 2 ̆ 7 at low temperature using 1 H NMR spectroscopy. The result of the model complexes lead to the development of a molecular level machine, in which, the flipping can be controlled by the geometry of the metal centre and monitored at room temperature using 1 H NMR spectroscopy.

40|$|A {{device is}} {{disclosed}} for sealing and clamping a cylindrical element {{which is to}} be attached to an object such as a wall, a pressurized vessel or another cylindrical element. The device includes a gland having an inner cylindrical wall, which is threaded at one end and is attached at a bendable end to a deformable portion, which in turn is attached to one end of a conical cantilever structure. The other end of the cantilever structure connects at a bendable area to one end of an outer cylindrical wall. The opposite end of cylindrical wall terminates in a thickened portion, the radially outer surface of which is adapted to accommodate a tool for rotating the gland. The terminal end of cylindrical wall also includes an abutment surface, which is adapted to engage a seal, which in turn engages a surface of a receiver. The receiver further includes a <b>threaded</b> <b>portion</b> for engagement with the <b>threaded</b> <b>portion</b> of gland whereby a tightening rotation of gland relative to receiver will cause relative movement between cylindrical walls and of gland. This movement causes a rotation of the conical structure and thus a bending action at bending area and at the bending end of the upper end of inner cylindrical wall. These rotational and bending actions result in a forcing of the deformable portion radially inwardly so as to contact and deform a pipe. This forcible contact creates a seal between gland and pipe, and simultaneously clamps the pipe in position...|$|R
40|$|AbstractType 316 L (N) {{stainless}} steel {{is one of}} the construction materials for Pressurized Fast Breeder Reactor, in India. The design of a material part involves various types of geometrical irregularities such as notches, holes, etc. which impose a certain degree of constraint on the deformation.

30|$|The use of PMMA to fill and {{stabilize}} implants {{has been}} a standard procedure in orthopedic surgery for decades. More recently, however, due to the popularity of kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty, the use of PMMA in spine surgery has become common. Indeed, PMMA {{can also be used}} to reinforce pedicular fixation in cases of impaired bone quality. Several experimental and clinical studies have proven that PMMA augmentation is capable of improving resistance to pull-out in osteoporotic and normal vertebrae [7, 8, 15 – 20]. In poor-quality bone, a gap is frequently created between the <b>threaded</b> <b>portion</b> of the screw and the trabecular spongy bone; cement strengthens the bone/metal interface at such points. PMMA screw augmentation may increase both the primary stability and the fatigue resistance of the implants [7, 8], making them better able to withstand the axial stresses responsible for pull-out [15 – 19].|$|R

50|$|A rod end bearing, {{also known}} as a heim joint (N. America) or rose joint (U.K. and elsewhere), is a {{mechanical}} articulating joint. Such joints are used on the ends of control rods, steering links, tie rods, or anywhere a precision articulating joint is required, and where a clevis end (which requires perfect 90 degree alignment between the attached shaft and the second component) is unsuitable. A ball swivel with an opening through which a bolt or other attaching hardware may pass is pressed into a circular casing with a threaded shaft attached. The <b>threaded</b> <b>portion</b> may be either male or female. The heim joint's advantage is that the ball insert permits the rod or bolt passing through it to be misaligned to a limited degree (an angle other than 90 degrees). A link terminated in two heim joints permits misalignment of their attached shafts (viz., other than 180 degrees) when used in tension. When used in compression, the through-rods are forced to the extreme ends of their ball's misalignment range, which cocks the link at an oblique angle.|$|R
