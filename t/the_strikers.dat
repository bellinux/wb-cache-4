5|$|From the start, {{the colonial}} {{authorities}} attempted to persuade <b>the</b> <b>strikers</b> to disperse {{and go back}} to work. When they refused, they were fired on. In Jadotville, 15 strikers were shot dead by the military. In Élisabethville, <b>the</b> <b>strikers,</b> including their leader Léonard Mpoyi, were invited to negotiations at the town's stadium, where they were offered various concessions, including a 30% pay rise.|$|E
5|$|After {{the arrival}} of the strikebreakers on the {{afternoon}} of November 2, Indianapolis Police Chief Martin Hyland had mounted city police escort them from Indianapolis Union Station to the company's maintenance and storage carhouses, one block south of the terminal building. The police broke a path through <b>the</b> <b>strikers</b> to allow the strikebreakers into the building so they could prepare to launch the cars. Organized labor leaders held two mass meetings and unions across the city agreed to send additional men to support <b>the</b> <b>strikers</b> against the strikebreakers. A riot began as the strikebreakers attempted to restore transit service. Whenever the strikebreakers launched a streetcar from the storage barns, <b>the</b> <b>strikers</b> attacked them with rocks and brick. They boarded the streetcars, dragged the crews from the cars and lit the cars on fire. Many injuries occurred on both sides and ambulances were called to carry the injured to a hospital. After the destruction of six cars, the strikebreakers abandoned their attempts to restart service.|$|E
5|$|In a 2007 {{commemorative}} ceremony the Queensland Government apologised to the surviving wives {{of two of}} <b>the</b> <b>strikers</b> {{for the actions of}} the Government in the 1950s.|$|E
5000|$|Run a hoop: To send <b>the</b> <b>striker’s</b> ball {{through a}} hoop. If the hoop is the hoop {{in order for}} <b>the</b> <b>striker’s</b> ball, <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> earns a bonus stroke.|$|R

50|$|It is {{prominently}} {{featured in}} issue #33 and 34. First, Bazooka is testing {{the possibility of}} installing a high-tech laser weapon on <b>the</b> <b>Striker.</b> Buzzer and Ripper steal the weapon. Bazooka uses <b>the</b> <b>Striker</b> to literally chase them through the 'Caulder Shopping Precinct'. It was early Sunday so the only thing <b>the</b> <b>Striker</b> damaged was product.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>strikers</b> {{directed}} much {{of their}} anger at the federal government, which they accused of overreaching and of refusing to listen to legitimate complaints by white workers.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>strikers</b> {{have gained}} {{absolutely}} nothing by the movement. The ten per cent reduction has been {{enforced by the}} four trunk lines, and the only concessions were those {{that might have been}} had for asking, without the loss of a single day's work. Such of <b>the</b> <b>strikers</b> as were caught committing criminal acts are now under arrest, and the great majority of the rest are most anxious to resume their places. Some of the railroad companies have discharged every man that took part in the strike, while others have only dropped the ringleaders, and have held out inducements to the others to return to work.|$|E
5|$|They go on {{to suggest}} that some unknown number of those {{participating}} in the ensuing riot may have traveled to Scranton expressly for that purpose, and not in support of <b>the</b> <b>strikers</b> or their objectives.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>striker,</b> which chimes <b>the</b> bell on the hour, is of {{cast iron}} and was {{produced}} at Cast-Fab Technologies, Inc., in Cincinnati, Ohio. A special iron was used to prevent <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> from damaging <b>the</b> bell when it hits the outside rim of the bell (see right side of photo). <b>The</b> <b>striker</b> allows <b>the</b> bell to be chimed without swinging it.|$|R
5000|$|Roquet: (Second {{syllable}} {{rhymes with}} [...] "play".) When <b>the</b> <b>striker’s</b> ball hits a ball {{that he is}} entitled to then take a croquet shot with. At {{the start of a}} turn, <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> is entitled to roquet all the other three balls once. Once <b>the</b> <b>striker's</b> ball goes through its target hoop, it is again entitled to roquet the other balls once.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the slide}} of the pistol enters battery, <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> engages <b>the</b> sear. At this point, the sear is held {{back in a}} {{partially}} cocked condition. When the trigger of the M&P is pulled, the trigger bar first engages the firing pin safety plunger, lifting it upward, and releasing firing pin safety. At the rearward extreme of the trigger bar's travel, it engages the sear. The sear is rotated downward by the trigger bar, fully cocking, then releasing <b>the</b> <b>striker.</b> <b>The</b> <b>striker</b> makes contact with the primer of the chambered round, which in turn ignites the gunpowder and propels the bullet forward. According to renowned M&P gunsmith Dan Burwell, the angle on the rear face of the sear creates a camming action against <b>the</b> <b>striker.</b> This camming action moves <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> to <b>the</b> rear very slightly during the trigger pull, thus finishing the [...] "cocking". This system is similar to <b>the</b> partially tensioned <b>striker</b> found in <b>the</b> Glock series of pistols. When the pistol cycles for the next shot, <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> will be automatically pre-set in a 98% cocked position. Because <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> is only 98% cocked prior to the trigger being pulled, Smith & Wesson classifies the M&P's action as [...] "striker fired (double action only)".|$|R
5|$|As the {{vandalism}} {{had shut}} down {{service at the}} central hub, a police squad was organized and dispatched to protect repairmen while they fixed the overhead cables at the main terminal building. The repairmen and the police were quickly surrounded by <b>the</b> <b>strikers</b> who hurled bricks and beat them with clubs. The police and repairmen were forced to flee and were prevented from restoring power to the terminal's lines. By the afternoon of November 1, <b>the</b> <b>strikers</b> were able to force a complete shut down of the urban central hub and halt all city streetcar operations. The shut down also stopped most of Indiana's inter-city light rail transportation, but regional routes outside of Indianapolis continued to operate. The shut down caused widespread disruption of public transportation and its effects were immediately felt by the public.|$|E
5|$|Gilberto is good {{at helping}} to defend against opponents who play a long ball game because he often man marks the opposition's attacking target-man. This cuts off the opposition's supply to <b>the</b> <b>strikers,</b> and thus forces the long-ball team to play through the midfield, {{something}} to which long-ball teams are not particularly suited.|$|E
5|$|Historians Hitchcock and Downs {{emphasized}} the far-reaching {{effects of the}} ongoing depression, inflation, rapidly increasing commodity prices, and mass unemployment, {{as well as the}} failure of <b>the</b> <b>strikers</b> to appreciate that these conditions affected the employer as well as the employee.|$|E
5000|$|From a {{position}} {{in contact with the}} ball that was hit, with <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> ball held steady by <b>the</b> <b>striker's</b> foot or hand (a [...] "foot shot" [...] or [...] "hand shot") ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>striker</b> is gripped {{behind the}} knob using one's fingertips, not {{on top of}} it. This allows more wrist action and helps the player to move <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> around <b>the</b> table faster.|$|R
5000|$|Sufficient {{pressure}} {{on the cover of}} the mine causes the cover to press downward onto the pressure cap of the fuze. This downward pressure forces the assembly surrounding <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> down until <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> retaining balls are aligned with a cavity. The balls are pushed aside and <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> is released impacting the detonator which detonates the C.E. pellet, triggering the exploder and then the main charge.|$|R
5|$|Romney took a {{leave of}} absence from Bain Capital from November 1993 to November 1994 to run for the U.S. Senate. During that time, Ampad workers went on strike and asked Romney to intervene. Against the advice of Bain Capital lawyers, Romney met <b>the</b> <b>strikers,</b> but told them he had no {{position}} of active authority in the matter.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} about 1,500 men began marching towards the {{electric}} distribution center used to power the entire streetcar system, several blocks away from the terminal building. The police had maintained a heavy guard around the building during the ongoing strike and Sheriff Porttens had given orders to use firearms to disperse any attempt by <b>the</b> <b>strikers</b> to take the building. As the crowd neared the building, the police opened fire. Several were injured and the crowd was driven away.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge, {{sensing the}} {{severity}} of circumstances were then in need of his intervention, conferred with Crane's operative, William Butler, and then acted. He called up more units of the National Guard, restored Curtis to office, and took personal control of the police force. Curtis proclaimed that all of <b>the</b> <b>strikers</b> were fired from their jobs, and Coolidge called for a new police force to be recruited.|$|E
25|$|If any {{of these}} rules is violated, an umpire will call the {{delivery}} a no ball. Additionally a player may not make any significant movement after the ball comes into play and before the ball reaches <b>the</b> <b>striker.</b> If this happens, an umpire will call and signal 'dead ball'. For close fielders anything other than minor adjustments to stance or position in relation to <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> is significant. In the outfield, fielders may move in towards <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> or striker's wicket; indeed, they usually do. However, anything other than slight movement off line or away from <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> is to be considered significant.|$|R
50|$|The Raw Fulcrum was {{introduced}} in 2008 and is substantially the same car as <b>the</b> <b>Striker.</b> It has different bodywork without the open wings of <b>the</b> <b>Striker.</b> This closed bodywork improves aerodynamics significantly.|$|R
30|$|To stop offside {{obstruction}} tactics, {{the rules}} were altered and, for <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> still to be in play, the opposite side players in front of <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> were brought down from three to two.|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{widespread}} vandalism and violence, only twenty arrests {{were made on}} the day. <b>The</b> <b>strikers</b> intimidated the police, {{and only a few}} were willing to arrest vandals. Chief Hyland and many officers were sympathetic to the strike, but the local judicial magistrates were not. According to one union report, union members who were arrested faced fines up to $50, while the arrested strikebreakers were immediately acquitted by a local judge.|$|E
5|$|In {{the police}} commissioner's Annual Report for 1919, Curtis {{presented}} {{his view of}} the strike. He argued that he had not even needed the requested State Guards for the strike's first night because the city remained quiet and he had reports that many policemen would not join the strike. By {{the end of the year}} <b>the</b> <b>strikers</b> had formed a new organization called the Association of Former Police of the City of Boston.|$|E
5|$|Most workers {{accepted}} {{the reduction in}} pay, but the firemen and those who ran the freight trains resolved to stop work in protest. However, the number of unemployed along the line was so great, owing to the ongoing economic problems, {{that the company had}} no difficulty replacing the absent strikers. In response, <b>the</b> <b>strikers</b> resolved to occupy portions of the rail line, and to stop trains from passing unless the company rescinded the wage cuts.|$|E
25|$|If the batsman facing <b>the</b> bowler (<b>the</b> <b>striker)</b> {{steps out}} of his ground to play the ball but misses and the wicket-keeper takes the ball and puts down the wicket, then <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> is out stumped.|$|R
5000|$|When placing <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> on <b>the</b> {{board to}} shoot, it must touch both 'base lines', either {{covering}} the end circle completely, or not touching it at all. <b>The</b> <b>striker</b> may {{not touch the}} diagonal arrow line.|$|R
5000|$|Rush: A roquet {{when the}} roqueted ball {{is sent to}} a {{specific}} position on the court, such as the next hoop for <b>the</b> <b>striker’s</b> ball or close to a ball that <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> wishes to roquet next.|$|R
5|$|Negotiations between strikers and the B were unsuccessful, {{and most}} strikers chose to quit rather than {{return to work}} at the newly reduced wages. The company easily found enough workers to replace <b>the</b> <b>strikers,</b> and under the {{protection}} of the military and police, traffic resumed on July 29. The company promised minor concessions at the time, and eventually enacted select reforms later that year. In total, between 10 and 22 were killed, more than 150 were injured, and many more were arrested.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{meetings}} and conferences of discontented workers continued across the country. A committee representing <b>the</b> <b>strikers</b> (including engineers, conductors, firemen, and brakemen) departed Baltimore to ensure solidarity along the line in demanding $2 per hour. According to the edition of July 20 of The Sun, the city was peaceful, but anxious, as many awaited word of the happenings in Martinsburg, which {{was seen as the}} central point of the movement.|$|E
5|$|On May 24, <b>the</b> <b>strikers</b> {{seized the}} Strong mine on Battle Mountain, which {{overlooked}} {{the town of}} Victor. The next day, at about 9am, 125 deputies arrived in Altman and set up camp {{at the base of}} Bull Hill. As they started to march toward the strikers' camp, miners at the Strong mine blew up the shafthouse, hurling the structure more than 300 feet into the air. A few moments later, the steam boiler was also dynamited, showering the deputies with timber, iron and cable. The deputies fled to the rail station and left town.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the first}} step, called [...] "kori kuthu", which is <b>the</b> qualifier, <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> places <b>the</b> kutti on the hole, {{and using the}} kolu lofts the kutti {{as far as he}} can. The kutti becomes {{airborne}} after it is lofted. If a fielder from the opposing team catches <b>the</b> kutti, <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> is out. If the kutti lands on the ground, the fielder closest to the kutti has one chance to hit the kolu ( [...] with a throw (similar to a run out in cricket).If the fielder misses <b>the</b> kolu, <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> progresses to <b>the</b> next step.In step two, called [...] "ittadi" [...] (meaning drop and strike), <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> holds kutti and kolu in the same hand, drops the kutti and strikes at it before it reaches ground. If the fielders catch <b>the</b> kutti, <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> goes out. If the kutti hits the ground, the fielder throws it back at the hole. Now, <b>the</b> <b>Striker</b> hits <b>the</b> kutti again. <b>The</b> <b>striker</b> then measures <b>the</b> distance from the point where the kutti lands, up to the hole, using the kolu in a straight line. If the measure is less than one length of kolu, <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> is out.The measuring sub-steps are: Saadu, Muri, Naazhi, Aytti, Aarenku. On measuring up to Aarenku, <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> counts one point and proceedes starting with Saadu again. Depending on the sub step at which the measure has ended <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> strikes <b>the</b> kutti from different positions:Saadu -> Places the kutty on the feet, tosses up and strikes with the koluMuri -> (easy one) drops the kutti from one hand and strikes with the koluNaazhi -> Places the kutti {{on the back of the}} palm with middle and ring fingers bent inwards, tosses up the kutti and strikes with the koluAytti -> drops the kutti from the elbow and strikes with the koluAarenku -> (tough one) Closes an eye, places the kutti over it, drops it and strikes with the kolu.|$|R
50|$|The {{overall design}} {{is similar to}} that of <b>the</b> British FV102 <b>Striker,</b> and it is often mistaken for the Tosan tank. However, there are some major {{differences}} between the Sayyad and <b>the</b> <b>Striker.</b> <b>The</b> Sayyad is shorter in length than <b>the</b> <b>Striker,</b> and it has one less road wheel. The hull is slightly redesigned and storage baskets have also been added.|$|R
25|$|Law 23: Bye and leg bye. If a {{ball that}} is not a wide passes <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> and runs are scored, they are called byes. If a ball hits <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> but not <b>the</b> bat and runs are scored, they are called leg-byes. However, leg-byes cannot be scored if <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> is neither {{attempting}} a stroke nor trying to avoid being hit. Byes and leg-byes are credited to the team's but not the batsman's total.|$|R
