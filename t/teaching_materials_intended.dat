40|$|The {{technical}} application of 3 D reconstruction, {{which can be}} built upon the fundamental concepts of analytical geometry and linear algebra as taught in German upper secondary forms, opens up an unfamiliar and challenging perspective on the geometric relationship of photographic images to the real 3 D scene which they depict and to one another. Although projections from 3 D to 2 D space are not injective functions, one aims at reconstructing form and location of a spatial object or the positions of a moving camera by measuring coordinates {{in one or more}} images. This is a typical problem from the field of Computer Vision. For instance, a robot navigating in space is reliant on information that can be taken from camera images. In recent decades science has come up with some elegant linear reconstruction algorithms that are based on the use of matrices and linear transformations. Linear equations are therefore the central reconstruction tool and fundamental principle which makes the problem accessible even for high school students. The purpose of this thesis is to didactically analyse the substantial context of 3 D point reconstruction from two camera images as found in Photogrammetry and Computer Vision, with the objective to convert it into an applied learning environment. It is aimed at designing authentic <b>teaching</b> <b>material</b> <b>intended</b> to be used with students in the transitional phase between high school and university. The latter constitute the main addressees of this thesis: It is directed towards mathematically-minded students of upper secondary forms in Germany who are well grounded in analytical geometry as well as towards science-oriented first-semester university students who are looking for an applied approach to elementary ideas of linear algebra. The resulting learning environment has been conceptualised as a guided programme (‚Leitprogramm‘) that students can work on self-responsibly and independently. It includes numerous illustrating GeoGebra- 3 D-applets as well as some MATLAB-tools that enable the students to conduct a computer-facilitated reconstruction project of their own from real photographs. Apart from being material for self-instruction, the programme {{can be used as a}} structured store for teachers to configure their own lessons or workshops according to their needs. To that end, the exercises for the central experimental working phases for students have been organised as independent worksheets. The {{technical application}} always stays in the focus of the programme - on the one hand, as motivational impulse and, on the other hand, as object of constant mathematical reflection. Fundamental ideas, methods and concepts of linear algebra that are generally applicable, useful and indispensable for many scientific fields are developed along its trajectories. These mathematical ideas are generated on the basis of the concrete technical problem, and their sustainability manifests in their practical implementation. This is supposed to be an incentive especially for those students who are planning to take up scientific or technical degree programmes at university. This thesis offers them valuable insight into the character of mathematics as it is presented to them in university courses. Parts of the developed <b>teaching</b> <b>material</b> have been tested in the context of a two-day workshop with high school students of German senior classes (grammar and comprehensive school), which was part of a week-long RWTH summer school for pupils on various topics of mathematics in the summer of 2014...|$|R

After the <b>teaching</b> <b>materials</b> had been produced and published on the Internet at the Finnish textile teachers' website KässäBoxi, the idea for this thesis emanated from the questions: Why do the three <b>teaching</b> <b>materials</b> look the way they do and why do other textile teachers comment that they are different? In earlier sloyd educational research it has been stated that a scientific paradigm affects the individual ideology of a sloyd teacher. The aimfor my doctoral thesis is to continue on the topic. As the area of interest comprises the thought behind three <b>teaching</b> <b>materials</b> in sloyd, the aim of the thesis is to show how teaching and educational ideologies in sloyd appear in the <b>teaching</b> <b>materials</b> at hand. The research approach has parallels to research about another, tangible phenomena, namely the iceberg. In a similar way as an iceberg, a <b>teaching</b> <b>material</b> has a profound base, but the base is not always completely visible to the user of the <b>teaching</b> <b>material.</b> In this thesis I strive to show what there is under the surface, on the surface and above the surface of three <b>teaching</b> <b>materials</b> in sloyd. The research approach is defined as qualitative and phenomenologic-hermeneutic. The analysis results in knowledge about how the producer of a <b>teaching</b> <b>material</b> affects the character of a <b>teaching</b> <b>material</b> by choices concerning for example the form, structure, language and illustrations of the <b>teaching</b> <b>material.</b> The analysis also shows how the producers' individual educational and teaching ideologies within the teaching subject at hand appear by means of traces concerning the view on the pupil and the teacher, and the view on planning and conducting teaching in sloyd. The thesis also results in knowledge about how sloyd educational scientific theories and demands from society, as they are stated in the national core curriculum, appear in the three <b>teaching</b> <b>materials.</b> The application of the sloyd educational scientific theory of individual sloyd activity as a holistic educative system is also widened in the thesis. This thesis contributes to future research on producing <b>teaching</b> <b>materials</b> by information about what aspects a producer of <b>teaching</b> <b>materials</b> needs to consider and how the aspects become visible in the <b>teaching</b> <b>materials.</b> This kind of knowledge is valuable to teacher students in sloyd, to teachers in sloyd who intend to plan and produce <b>teaching</b> <b>materials</b> and to teachers who tutor the planning and production of <b>teaching</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R
