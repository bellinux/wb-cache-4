5|$|His opponents {{learned from}} Napoleon's innovations. The {{increased}} importance of artillery after 1807 stemmed from his {{creation of a}} highly mobile artillery force, the growth in artillery numbers, and changes in artillery practices. As {{a result of these}} factors, Napoleon, rather than relying on infantry <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>away</b> the enemy's defenses, now could use massed artillery as a spearhead to pound a break in the enemy's line that was then exploited by supporting infantry and cavalry. McConachy rejects the alternative theory that growing reliance on artillery by the French army beginning in 1807 was an outgrowth of the declining quality of the French infantry and, later, France's inferiority in cavalry numbers. Weapons and other kinds of military technology remained static through the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, but 18th-century operational mobility underwent change.|$|E
25|$|Abrasion is the {{property}} of the coal which describes its propensity and ability <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>away</b> machinery and undergo autonomous grinding. While carbonaceous matter in coal is relatively soft, quartz and other mineral constituents in coal are quite abrasive. This is tested in a calibrated mill, containing four blades of known mass. The coal is agitated in the mill for 12,000 revolutions at a rate of 1,500 revolutions per minute.(I.E 1500 revolution for 8 min.) The abrasion index is determined by measuring the loss of mass of the four metal blades.|$|E
500|$|Shen and {{the other}} {{characters}} were mostly well received. Cooper applauded the conflicted nature of Shen's personality {{as a result of}} being in an overwhelming situation, arguing that this detail solidified him as a developed and likeable protagonist. Cooper found the Triad members unsatisfactory by comparison, comparing them unfavorably with Grand Theft Auto characters. Edge called Shen an engaging protagonist and also complimented the other characters, whose voice actors brought life to the characters. Blyth described the cast, aside from Shen, as [...] "brilliantly recognizable stereotypes that have been given enough extra edge for you to care about them", and felt the attitude shifts of some characters were distracting and unrealistic. Wilson said that the characters were [...] "fleshed out brilliantly". Pinsof claimed that the game's premise [...] "grants a perfect excuse for Shen to do terrible things while remaining a sympathetic, level-headed lead." [...] Kelly thought Shen's two-faced nature was the main entertainment factor of the missions. Whitehead found the player's ability to switch allegiances as needed <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>away</b> at [...] "the already fragile grasp the narrative has on Shen's conflicted loyalties." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rabbits {{and other}} {{lagomorphs}} usually shed their deciduous teeth before (or very shortly after) their birth, {{and are usually}} born with their permanent teeth. [...] The teeth of rabbits complement their diet, which consists {{of a wide range}} of vegetation. Since many of the foods are abrasive enough to cause attrition, rabbit teeth grow continuously throughout life. [...] Rabbits have a total of 6 incisors, three upper premolars, three upper molars, two lower premolars, and two lower molars on each side. There are no canines. Three to four millimeters of the tooth is worn away by incisors every week, whereas the posterior teeth require a month <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>away</b> the same amount.|$|E

Erös Béla continued in his unemotional attentions to her--he was more sure of success than ever. His words of courtship were the drops of water that were ultimately destined <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>away</b> a stone.|$|E

60|$|His constancy, the humility {{with which}} he made his suit, the obvious {{intensity}} of his devotion, began at last <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>away</b> that gentlewoman's opposition, as dripping water wears away a stone. Yet she could not bring herself to forget that he was Sir Oliver's brother--{{the brother of the}} man she had loved, and the brother of the man who had killed her own brother. Between them stood, then, two things; the ghost of that old love of hers and the blood of Peter Godolphin.|$|E
6000|$|They built a fire, {{cooked and}} ate. The Yaqui spoke only one word: [...] "Sleep." [...] Blankets were spread. Mercedes {{dropped into a}} deep slumber, her head on Thorne's shoulder. Excitement kept Thorne awake. The two rangers dozed beside the fire. Gale shared the Yaqui's watch. The sun began to climb and the icy edge of dawn <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>away.</b> Rabbits bobbed their cotton tails under the mesquite. Gale climbed a rocky wall above the arroyo bank, and there, with command over the miles of the back-trail, he watched.|$|E

60|$|His {{feeling of}} intense enmity to Dockwrath was {{beginning}} <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>away,</b> {{and one of}} modified friendship {{for the whole family}} was supervening. It was much better that it should be so. He could not understand before how Dockwrath had had the heart to write to him and call him John, but now he did understand it. He felt that he could himself be friendly with Dockwrath now, and forgive him all the injury; he felt also that it would not go so much against the grain with him to marry that friend as to whom his sister would so often solicit him.|$|E
60|$|I {{pressed his}} hand to my heart, and the tears stood in my eyes. I sat down by his bed-side, and watched him, but he never spoke again. My presence, however, gave him evident satisfaction--for every now and then, {{as he looked at}} me, a vague smile would come over his visage, and he would feebly point to the sealed box on the table. As the day wore away, his life seemed <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>away</b> with it. Towards sunset, his hand sunk on the bed and lay motionless; his eyes grew glazed; his mouth {{remained}} open, and thus he gradually died.|$|E
60|$|Hucks {{informed}} me that the two sisters walked by the window four or five times, as if anxiously. Doubtless they think themselves deceived by some face strikingly like me. God bless her! Her image is in the sanctuary of my bosom, and never can it be torn from thence, but by the strings that grapple my heart to life! This circumstance made me quite ill. I had been wandering among the wild-wood scenery and terrible graces of the Welsh mountains <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>away,</b> not to revive, {{the images of the}} past;--but love is a local anguish; I am fifty miles distant, and am not half so miserable.|$|E

60|$|In {{the first}} flaming hours of wonder, {{she did not}} know what she felt. She was as if tied to the stake. The flames were licking her and devouring her. But the flames were also good.

60|$|Though {{reason and}} my long {{residence}} here had assured me, that these savages {{never came up}} to the thick woody parts of the country, and that I had no reason to be apprehensive of a discovery; yet such an abhorence did I still retain, that, for two years after, I confined myself only to my three plantation: I mean my castle, country-seat, and inclosure in the woods. And though in process of time, my dreadful apprehensions began <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>away,</b> yet my eyes were more vigilant for fear of being heard by those creatures, they should proceed to attack me. I resolved, however, manfully to lose my life if they did, and went armed with three pistols stuck in my girdle, which added to the description I have given of myself before, made me look with a very formidable appearance.|$|E
60|$|Her {{face had}} the usual fulness of {{expression}} which is {{developed by a}} life of solitude. Where {{the eyes of a}} multitude beat like waves upon a countenance they seem <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>away</b> its individuality; but in the still water of privacy every tentacle of feeling and sentiment shoots out in visible luxuriance, to be interpreted as readily as a child's look by an intruder. In years she was no more than nineteen or twenty, but the necessity of taking thought at a too early period of life had forced the provisional curves of her childhood's face to a premature finality. Thus she had but little pretension to beauty, save in one prominent particular--her hair. Its abundance made it almost unmanageable; its color was, roughly speaking, and as seen here by firelight, brown, but careful notice, or an observation by day, would have revealed that its true shade was a rare and beautiful approximation to chestnut.|$|E

'It seems hard that {{a man with a}} sweet young wife like his should be putting in his years in this Godforsaken hole, where every year counts two on the outside.' 'The trouble with him is clean grit and stubbornness. He's cleaned up twice with a stake, but lost it both times.' Here the {{conversation}} was broken off by an uproar from Bettles, for the effect had begun <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>away.</b> And soon the bleak years of monotonous grub and deadening toil were being forgotten in rough merriment. Malemute Kid alone seemed unable to lose himself, and cast many an anxious look at his watch.
