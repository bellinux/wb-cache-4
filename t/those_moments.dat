Never shall I forget <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never.|$|E
5|$|It was {{a little}} strange. And {{definitely}} when I {{walked down the aisle}} I was like, 'This is kind of creepy — there’s some other man standing there!' It was really beautiful. People were all really excited like it was really my wedding. My mother was even like, 'Aww', and I was like, 'Mom, it's a video. This is not my dress. This is not the real wedding.' But I think it’s just one of <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> that every woman kind of fantasizes and relives.|$|E

25|$|Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman (recurring season 2, main cast season 3–5)– {{a crooked}} strip mall lawyer who {{represents}} Walt and Jesse. Odenkirk drew inspiration for Goodman from film producer Robert Evans. I thought about Robert Evans because I've listened to The Kid Stays in the Picture on CD. He's constantly switching up his cadence and his delivery. He emphasizes interesting words. He has loads of attitude {{in almost every}} line that he says. So when I rehearse the scenes alone I do my impersonation of Robert Evans to find <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> and turns. Then I go out and I do Saul.|$|E
25|$|Solhi al-Wadi's immense overall activity, {{especially}} his administrative, teaching and performing duties, allowed him limited time for composing, but he cherished <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> {{when he could}} satisfy the great urge he had to express himself. He believed that he should contribute {{to the world of}} music by whatever means he was capable of. His works are performed enthusiastically by musicians in Syria and other countries. In addition to that he received throughout his artistic life commissions to compose music for Arabic films, something he accepted and fulfilled with pleasure, but even though incidental music brought him fame all over the Arab world, his compositions for chamber ensembles figure among his finest creative achievements.|$|E
25|$|Explaining {{the causes}} of {{delusions}} continues to be challenging and several theories have been developed. One is the genetic or biological theory, which states that close relatives of people with delusional disorder {{are at increased risk}} of delusional traits. Another theory is the dysfunctional cognitive processing, which states that delusions may arise from distorted ways people have of explaining life to themselves. A third theory is called motivated or defensive delusions. This one states that some of those persons who are predisposed might suffer the onset of delusional disorder in <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> when coping with life and maintaining high self-esteem becomes a significant challenge. In this case, the person views others as the cause of their personal difficulties in order to preserve a positive self-view.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} game was largely positive, albeit lukewarm; receiving a rating of 71% at review aggregation website Metacritic. Reviews generally praised the high graphical standard in the game, PC Zone described the visuals as superb and praised the use of [...] "transparent surfaces and open frameworks to alleviate the potential monotony of racing through a drainpipe." [...] IGN echoed this, stating that at <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> where [...] "a solid tunnel breaks into a transparent one", [...] "the true meticulous nature of the courses can be realized". GameSpot praised the graphical effects, describing them as [...] "a psychedelic display of cosmic lighting and motion-blur wizardry".|$|E
500|$|Nora Ephron {{wrote the}} {{introduction}} to Beckerman's eponymous 1995 book, which she immediately thought had dramatic possibilities. [...] She identified with the stories in Love, Loss, and What I Wore because the book [...] "is not about fashion; it is about what clothes really are to us, <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> when we are constantly trying to find our identity through them". [...] Soon after its publication, Ephron gave the book to eight of her friends for Christmas. She became interested in writing her {{own version of the}} book. [...] Once she decided to adapt Love, Loss, and What I Wore into a play, she and her sister emailed 100 women for stories.|$|E
500|$|This {{would cause}} {{problems}} for the studio, Universal and partner MGM. [...] "The studio is just back from the holiday and is regrouping based on the news, and has no cohesive game plan at the moment," [...] said Kevin Misher, Universal's President of Production. Misher added that, [...] "It was one of <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> {{when you sit down}} and think, 'Can Clarice be looked upon as James Bond for instance? A character who is replaceable?' Or was Jodie Foster Clarice Starling, and the audience will not accept anyone else?" [...] Foster said in December 1999 that the characterization of Starling in Hannibal had [...] "negative attributes" [...] and [...] "betrayed" [...] the original character.|$|E

500|$|She enjoyed {{drinking}} Scotch and sherry; as {{friend and}} neighbor Helen Muir remembered her, [...] "She {{would come up}} and have a sherry, and then I would walk her home, and then she'd walk me back, {{and we would have}} another sherry. What fun she was." [...] Novelist Hervey Allen called Marjory Stoneman Douglas and Muir, [...] "the Stewart Avenue Gang". The two were fond of having sherry together and gossiping, but <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> were followed by serious talk of the future of libraries, and {{the role of women in}} South Florida. They were confidants, and often shared their work with one another. Douglas never learned to drive and never owned a car. Her house also had no air conditioning, electric stove, or dishwasher.|$|E
500|$|Lopez was {{surprised}} by the enormous media coverage, declaring in an interview: [...] "It was a nice dress. I had no idea it was going to become such a big deal." [...] Versace later revealed that the dress was the turning point of her career, saying that the media now had confidence in her own work, after the death of Gianni Versace. She declared to the Canadian press, [...] "It was an unexpected success. The next day she [...] was everywhere and people were talking about her in that dress. It was one of <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> like the one that Gianni [...] had with Elizabeth Hurley and clothes-pins." [...] The dress has been referred to many times as [...] "notorious" [...] and [...] "infamous" [...] because of its boldness.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to questions posed by The Guardian and handed to the band via their lawyer, Pussy Riot accused Putin and the Russian Orthodox Church of orchestrating the case. Samutsevich said in December 2012 that [...] "more than anything, what many people didn't see during the trial were <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> when our 'right to defence' was violated. It's not that we were helpless, it was a situation of despair." [...] In an interview with The Guardian, she continued: [...] "The trial was built {{in such a way}} that we couldn't defend ourselves. They didn't listen to us. We could have sat downstairs, where you wait till you're taken to the courtroom, and not go in at all and everything would've gone the same way. The fact that we took part physically [...] didn't actually change anything." ...|$|E

It’s like a leaf or a feather floating by. We can never quite hold it. Just flutter it for a while, then, it inevitably falls. Yet, how precious are <b>those</b> few <b>moments</b> we have. With the awareness comes the possibility that for the minimal time the feather or the leaf floats by, we can be as still as we can possibly be. For that millisecond we are sublime...|$|R

500|$|On 25 November 2014, it was {{announced}} that Goodrem had agreed to reprise her role for Neighbours 30th anniversary celebrations. Goodrem began filming that day and tweeted her excitement about Nina making a guest appearance. Her return featured during three episodes starting from 16 March 2015. Series producer Jason Herbison confirmed that the theme of music would tie into the character's return. It was later confirmed that Nina returns to Erinsborough after her relationship with Jack ends. Goodrem said she understood what her character was going through, saying [...] "I have experienced the feelings Nina is going through. I've had <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> where you question where you are going and you have to look back to know where to move forward." [...] The singer and actress said her return to Neighbours felt [...] "natural" [...] and she instantly knew what Nina would be wearing the moment she went into wardrobe.|$|E
500|$|The ending, {{in which}} the pirates are each {{shot to death by}} American snipers, {{reflects}} the resolution of the pirate hijacking of the MV Maersk Alabama in April 2009, where U.S. Navy SEALs rescued the captain after three snipers simultaneously killed three pirates with one shot each. They are portrayed in a particularly sympathetic light when they are killed during the ending. Travis Fickett of IGN said, [...] "It's one of <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> where South Park feels the need to give voice to a side the media is ignoring—and points out that things aren't quite as cut and dry [...] as we might like." [...] The episode has also been described as a commentary on the way in which Americans tend to take their relative wealth and comfort for granted. A U.S. Navy SEAL ordering another to [...] "not hit the white ones" [...] has also been described as an indictment of the American approach to foreign policy.|$|E
500|$|The {{rehearsal}} {{process is}} really understated. It's funny because it's not really needed. It's not needed for us anyway. Because {{we know how}} to play the songs, and the [...] charts don't change the songs structurally at all. But the symphony charts are something that you're not used to hearing. And then the symphony doesn't need the rehearsal because they sight-read. They sight-read better than we could even imagine. So when we get there, they already know how to play our songs better than we do... The purpose of the rehearsal is really, honestly to prepare the band for exactly how powerful the concert is going to be. When the symphony jumps in during <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> where all of a sudden you're singing a song you sing every night and then 30 more musicians start playing, it's so powerful that it causes you to take pause, and you can't take pause. And that's what the rehearsal really is for.|$|E

500|$|The {{video for}} the song was {{nominated}} in the category for Best Rock Video at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards. According to Jon Wiederhorn from MTV News, the shots of the video are [...] "evocative and artistic, resembling {{a cross between a}} foreign film and a Chanel advertisement." [...] Joe D'Angelo of MTV News said that Lee's disconnection in the video shows a [...] "distressed and emotionally wrought heroine." [...] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone praised the video saying that Lee looked like a [...] "teen-misery titan" [...] and that she [...] "tiptoed through a marble castle of pain". He also concluded that she could have borrowed the dress from Stevie Nicks. During an interview with Spin in 2011 Lee said that it was weird for her to watch the old videos of the band including the one for [...] "My Immortal". She explained, [...] "Just watching our oldest videos, it's weird. I definitely remember watching 'My Immortal,' like, 'That was not some dream where it was really somebody else.' I've totally had a couple of <b>those</b> <b>moments.</b> It's cool." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers were {{especially}} {{pleased with the}} emotional experience of playing the game, particularly with other players. Christian Donlan of Eurogamer {{described it as a}} [...] "non-denominational religious experience" [...] that, with the addition of another player, moves beyond metaphors and becomes a [...] "pilgrimage" [...] to the player. A reviewer writing for Edge magazine said the emotional arc of the game hits with [...] "occasionally startling power", while Patrick Shaw from Wired said the game made him feel a [...] "wide range of emotions... wonder, fear, even sadness". Miller said all three times he played the game, [...] "each time, without fail, individual moments... managed to give me goosebumps, and <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> have remained on my mind for weeks afterward". Joel Gregory of PlayStation Official Magazine praised the game's story for being open to the player's interpretation, leaving an ambiguity that drew him in. The addition of an unnamed second player was described by Donlan as brilliant and as a [...] "master stroke", and Edge said it made for [...] "a more absorbing, more atmospheric experience".|$|E
500|$|Wan {{pitched the}} idea to Whannell of two men chained to {{opposite}} sides of a bathroom with a dead body {{in the middle of}} the floor and they are trying to figure out why and how they are there. By the end of the film they realize the person lying on the floor is not dead and he is the reason they are locked in the room. Whannell initially did not give Wan the reaction he was looking for. He said, [...] "I'll never forget that day. I remember hanging up the phone and started just going over it in my head, and without any sort of long period of pondering, I opened my diary that I had at the time and wrote the word 'Saw'." [...] Before instantaneously writing the word [...] "Saw" [...] in a blood-red, dripping font, the two had not come up with a title. [...] "It was one of <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> that made me aware that some things just really are meant to be. Some things are just waiting there to be discovered," [...] Whannell said.|$|E
