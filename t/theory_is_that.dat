5|$|The {{origin of}} the name of the pub is unclear, but one {{reported}} <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it was named after the 17th-century warship HMS Royal Oak, which was sunk at the nearby Raid on the Medway in 1664. Local people say that one of the beams in the pub comes from the ship, the remains of which may have been broken up at a nearby shipyard after the battle. Another <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it was named after the Royal Oak that Charles II of England hid in following the Battle of Worcester.|$|E
5|$|Climate models {{predict that}} {{increased}} {{greenhouse gas emissions}} cause a cooling of the mesosphere, which would lead to more frequent and widespread occurrences of noctilucent clouds.

5|$|Common ravens {{are known}} to steal and cache shiny objects such as pebbles, pieces of metal, and golf balls. One <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they hoard shiny objects to impress other ravens. Other {{research}} indicates that juveniles are deeply curious about all new things, and that common ravens retain an attraction to bright, round objects based on their similarity to bird eggs. Mature birds lose their intense interest in the unusual, and become highly neophobic.|$|E
5|$|In late antiquity, {{historic}} accounts {{become much}} more diffuse, and the Iazyges generally cease to be mentioned as a tribe. In the late 4thcentury, two Sarmatian peoples were mentioned, the Argaragantes and the Limigantes, who lived {{on opposite sides of}} the Tisza river. One <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> these two tribes were formed when the Iazyges were conquered by the Roxolani, with the Iazyges becoming the Limigantes, and the Roxolani becoming the Argaragantes. Another <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a group of Slavic tribesmen gradually migrated into the area, subservient to the Iazyges, and the Iazyges became known as the Argaragantes, and the Slavs were the Limigantes. Regardless of which is true, in the 5th century both of them were conquered by the Goths, and, by the time of Attila, they were absorbed into the Huns.|$|E

5|$|The breed's {{history is}} {{uncertain}} before {{the middle of}} the 19th century. One <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it originated in France, stating that the Duc de Noailles {{at the time of the}} French Revolution gave his kennel of prized spaniels to the Duke of Newcastle at Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire. The theory goes, that the now extinct Alpine Spaniel was bred with Basset Hounds, and the Pyrenean Mountain Dog also known as the Great Pyrenees. A second <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it is descended from the old type of Bleinheim Spaniel, which was later to be incorporated into the King Charles breed of Spaniel. Originally these dogs were large gundogs, colored lemon and white whereas the modern breed of them is a much smaller lap/toy breed of dog.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{inhabitants of}} what is now Rwanda were the Twa, a group of aboriginal pygmy hunter-gatherers who settled in the area between 8000 BC and 3000 BC and remain in Rwanda today. Between 700 BC and 1500 AD, a number of Bantu groups migrated into Rwanda, and began to clear forest land for agriculture. The forest-dwelling Twa lost much of their habitat and moved to the slopes of mountains. Historians have several theories regarding the nature of the Bantu migrations; one <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the first settlers were Hutu, while the Tutsi migrated later and formed a distinct racial group, possibly of Cushitic origin. An alternative <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the migration was slow and steady, with incoming groups integrating into rather than conquering the existing society. Under this theory, the Hutu and Tutsi distinction arose later and was a class distinction rather than a racial one.|$|E
5|$|The reserve covers four woods: Park Wood, Mad Bess Wood and Copse Wood in Ruislip, with Bayhurst Wood in Harefield. Poor's Field and Tartleton's Lake in Ruislip {{are also}} part of the reserve. There is no {{definitive}} explanation as to why Mad Bess Wood received its name, although one <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it was named after a female landowner who patrolled the wood looking for poachers.|$|E

5|$|A third theory, {{supported}} by both Serbian and Bulgarian researchers, is that despot Michael is an unknown son of Michael Asen IV, the first-born son of Bulgarian tsar Ivan Alexander (r. 1331–1371), who was proclaimed co-tsar {{shortly after his}} father's accession and died in a battle against the Ottomans before 1354–1355. Against this identification is the account of Nikephoros Gregoras, who mentions that Michael Asen's widow returned childless to Constantinople after his death. Another issue with this <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> no source mentions Michael Asen as a despot.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Madeleine, {{nearly four}} at the time, left the {{apartment}} by herself, perhaps {{to look for}} her parents, and was abducted by a passer-by or fell {{into one of the}} open construction sites nearby. This is widely regarded as unlikely. According to her mother, Madeleine would have had to open the unlocked patio doors, close the curtains behind her, close the door again, open and close the child gate {{at the top of the}} stairs, then open and close the gate leading to the street.|$|E
5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1938, the Mingo Oak failed to produce leaves, and on May of that year, West Virginia state {{forester}} D.B. Griffin announced the tree's death. The prevailing <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the tree died from the release of poisonous gases and sulfur fumes from a burning spoil tip in nearby Trace Gap. The tree was felled with fanfare on September 23, 1938, with transections {{being sent to the}} Smithsonian Institution and the West Virginia State Museum. Under the terms of the Island Creek Coal Company's lease with the West Virginia Game, Fish, and Forestry Commission, the land's lease around the former tree reverted to the company following the tree's felling.|$|E
50|$|In 1997 and 1998 {{there were}} riots {{in various parts}} of Indonesia. Sometimes these riots were aimed against the Chinese-Indonesians. Some riots looked {{spontaneous}} and some looked as if they had <b>been</b> planned. One <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> pro-Suharto generals <b>were</b> trying to weaken the forces of democracy by increasing the divisions between the orthodox and the non-orthodox Muslims, between the Muslims and the Christians and between the Chinese and the non-Chinese. Another <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> certain generals <b>were</b> trying to topple Suharto.|$|R
5000|$|In {{many of the}} {{accounts}} written in the late 19th century, the Mahogany Ship was described as Spanish. According to local writer and antiquarian Jack Loney, several theories supporting the Spanish connection <b>were</b> advanced. One <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the ship <b>was</b> the galleon [...] "Santa Ysabel", which had sailed from Peru in 1595. A second <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the wreck <b>was</b> the ex-Spanish ship Santa Anna. This is clearly incorrect as Santa Anna wrecked in 1811 in the Straits of Timor.|$|R
25|$|Several <b>theories</b> <b>were</b> {{advanced}} {{to explain the}} emergence of the new virus. These included increased contact between humans and mice due to a 'bumper crop' in the deer mouse population. Another <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> something within the virus had changed, allowing it to jump to humans. A third <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> nothing had changed, that hantavirus cases had occurred previously, they just had not been properly diagnosed before. This last theory {{turned out to be the}} correct one when it <b>was</b> discovered <b>that</b> the first known case had actually occurred in a 38-year-old Utah man in 1959.|$|R
5|$|Hulk Hogan's visibly damaged eye was {{explained}} in the storyline {{as the result of}} Ted DiBiase hiring a group of men to attack Hogan before the match. In reality, the cause of injury has been open to debate. One <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Randy Savage punched Hogan because he believed that his ex-wife Elizabeth Hulette had an affair with Hogan while Savage and Hulette were married (the couple divorced in September 1992). WWF officials claimed that the injury {{was the result of a}} Jet Ski accident.|$|E
5|$|Modern human {{settlement}} {{of what is}} now Rwanda dates from, at the latest, the last glacial period, either in the Neolithic period around 8000 BC, or in the long humid period which followed, up to around 3000 BC. Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of sparse settlement by hunter gatherers in the late stone age, followed by a larger population of early Iron Age settlers, who produced dimpled pottery and iron tools. These early inhabitants were the ancestors of the Twa, aboriginal pygmy hunter-gatherers who remain in Rwanda today. Between 700 BC and 1500 AD, a number of Bantu groups migrated into Rwanda, clearing forest land for agriculture. The forest-dwelling Twa lost much of their habitat and moved to the mountain slopes. Historians have several theories regarding the nature of the Bantu migrations; one <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the first settlers were Hutu, while the Tutsi migrated later to form a distinct racial group, possibly of Nilo-hamitic origin. An alternative <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the migration was slow and steady, with incoming groups integrating into rather than conquering the existing society. Under this theory, the Hutu and Tutsi distinction arose later and was a class distinction rather than a racial one.|$|E
5|$|One popular <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{squirrel}} monkeys did live in Colombia {{during the}} late Miocene or Pliocene and these squirrel monkeys migrated to Central America, becoming the ancestors of the current Central American species. According to this theory, the Guatemalan black howler migrated to Central America around the same time. Passage through the isthmus of Panama later closed due to rising oceans, and eventually opened up to another wave of migration about 2 million years ago. These later migrants, ancestors to modern populations of white-headed capuchins, mantled howlers and Geoffroy's spider monkeys, out-competed the earlier migrants, leading to the small range of the Central American squirrel monkey and Guatemalan black howler.|$|E

5|$|Some prey {{animals such as}} zebra {{are marked}} with high-contrast {{patterns}} which possibly help to confuse their predators, such as lions, during a chase. The bold stripes of a herd of running Zebra have been claimed {{make it difficult for}} predators to estimate the prey's speed and direction accurately, or to identify individual animals, giving the prey an improved chance of escape. Since dazzle patterns (such as the Zebra's stripes) make animals harder to catch when moving, but easier to detect when stationary, there is an evolutionary trade-off between dazzle and camouflage. Another <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the zebra's stripes could provide some protection from flies and biting insects.|$|E
