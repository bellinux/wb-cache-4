5|$|Calcium ions may be {{complexed}} by proteins through binding the {{carboxyl groups}} of glutamic acid or aspartic acid residues; through interacting with phosphorylated serine, tyrosine, or threonine residues; or by being chelated by γ-carboxylated amino acid residues. Trypsin, a digestive enzyme, uses the first method; osteocalcin, a bone matrix protein, uses the third. Some other bone matrix proteins such as osteopontin and bone sialoprotein use both {{the first and}} the second. Direct activation of enzymes by binding calcium is common; some other enzymes are activated by noncovalent association with direct calcium-binding enzymes. Calcium also binds to the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane, anchoring proteins associated with the cell surface. As an example of the wide range of solubility of calcium compounds, monocalcium phosphate is very soluble in water, 85% of extracellular calcium is as dicalcium phosphate with a solubility of 2.0mM and the hydroxyapatite of bones in an organic matrix is <b>tricalcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> at 100µM.|$|E

The green body was sintered in air to a maximum temperature of 1100 degrees C for 4 h, which produced excellent three-dimensionally (3 -D) interconnected structures with open pores. The nature of the pore channels varied from dendritic, columnar, and cellular to mixed geometry, with dense outer shells in some cases, depending on the particular method used. A monotonic increase in porosity with loading was observed with a decrease in the loading volume. Microstructural analysis was used for porous structures to extract information on geometry, porosity, and pore size distribution.

Powder particle size was investigated using laser diffraction. Materials were mixed with 2. 5 % Na 2 HPO 4 solution to initiate the hydration of alpha-TCP to calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite (CDHA). Isothermal calorimetry was performed to observe thermal response of the powders over a period of time. During the reaction process, at various time points up to 216 h, the material was compression tested to observe strength development. Materials proved to be predominantly alpha phase, while amorphous content determined by XRD varied. Reactivity, as measured by isothermal calorimetry, varied with crystallinity of the alpha-TCP powder. Speed of strength development did not change except for the most finely ground powder. In addition, crystal size of the CDHA was changed only in the product formed from the most highly ground material.

Solid loading of 10 to 60 % of ball milled ceramic slurries were freeze cast followed by sublimation at - 70 to 60 degrees C.

This thesis have been addressed to the examination of the basic principles and methods oriented to the development of tailored scaffolds for bone tissue regeneration. In this direction, different polycaprolactone based composite scaffolds have been developed through novel and traditional techniques of preparation such as phase inversion/salt leaching, thermal induced phase separation (TIPS) and melting induced microspheres sintering (MIMS)).

This study used RF-magnetron sputtering (RF-MS) to deposit CaP onto 316 LSS.

An L(9) (3 (4)) orthogonal array was employed to design the experiment that was used to investigate four important coating parameters which include RF-power, argon gas flow rate, deposition time and post-heat treatment conditions. The coating composition and structure were evaluated using XRD, EDX and FTIR. The mechanical property was measured in terms of the adhesion strength using a microscratch testing machine. The response graph of the results revealed that the interfacial strength of CaP was mainly influenced by the deposition power, while the coating thickness was predominantly affected by the argon gas flow rate. High adhesion strength was achieved when the coatings have at least 2 mu m thickness and deposited at a working pressure of 12 m Torr. A NOVA on the control factors helped rank the parameters accordingly in order of importance. Based on the response of the control factors, it was found that optimum adhesion strength could be achieved by depositing the coatings using the following parameters: 10 sccm of argon gas flow rate; 150 W of RF power; and 16 h of deposition...|$|R

To enhance osseointegration and bioactivity, calcium phosphate cements prepared with hydroxyapatite, brushite or <b>tricalcium</b> <b>phosphates</b> have been introduced with rather unsuccessful results due to increased cement viscosity, poor handling and reduced mechanical performance. This has limited {{the use of such}} cements in applications requiring delivery through small cannulas and in load bearing. The goal {{of this study is to}} design an alternative cement system that can better accommodate calcium-phosphate additives while preserving cement rheological properties and performance. In the present work, a number of brushite-filled two-solution bone cements were prepared and characterized by studying their complex viscosity-versus-test frequency, extrusion stress, clumping tendency during injection through a syringe, extent of fill of a machined void in cortical bone analog specimens, and compressive strength. The addition of brushite into the two-solution cement formulations investigated did not affect the pseudoplastic behavior and handling properties of the materials as demonstrated by rheological experiments. Extrusion stress was observed to vary with brushite concentration with values lower or in the range of control PMMA-based cements. The materials were observed to completely fill pre-formed voids in bone analog specimens. Cement compressive strength was observed to decrease with increasing concentration of fillers; however, the materials exhibited high enough strength for consideration in load bearing applications. The results indicated that partially substituting the PMMA phase of the two-solution cement with brushite at a 40 % by mass concentration provided the best combination of the properties investigated.

Autografts still represent {{the gold standard}} for bone substitution, though the morbidity and the inherent limited availability are the main limitations. Allografts, i. e. banked bone, are osteoconductive and weakly osteoinductive, though there are still concerns about the residual infective risks, costs and donor availability issues. As an alternative, xenograft substitutes are cheap, but their use provided contrasting results, so far. Ceramic-based synthetic bone substitutes are alternatively based on hydroxyapatite (HA) and <b>tricalcium</b> <b>phosphates,</b> and are widely used in the clinical practice. Indeed, despite being completely resorbable and weaker than cortical bone, they have exhaustively proved to be effective. Biomimetic HAs are the evolution of traditional HA and contains ions (carbonates, Si, Sr, Fl, Mg) that mimic natural HA (biomimetic HA). Injectable cements represent another evolution, enabling mininvasive techniques. Bone morphogenetic proteins (namely BMP 2 and 7) are the only bone inducing growth factors approved for human use in spine surgery and for the treatment of tibial nonunion. Demineralized bone matrix and platelet rich plasma did not prove to be effective and their use as bone substitutes remains controversial. Experimental cell-based approaches are considered the best suitable emerging strategies in several regenerative medicine application, including bone regeneration.

Despite the well-known effects of rhizosphere trophic relationships on N mineralization, almost no work has yet been done on P mineralization. We, therefore, hypothesized that the interactions between phosphorus solubilizing bacteria and bacterial grazer nematodes are able to improve plant available P use from abundantly present P source. We tested the hypothesis by isolating P solubilizing bacterial strains and growing them with Pine seedlings in sand containing TCP as sole P source. The plants were grown alone or with a P solubilizing bacterial strain along with bacterial-feeder nematodes. The bacteria and the nematodes were isolated from same region of rich unavailable P zone of lower Himalaya. Interestingly the grazing of bacteria by nematodes enhanced plant P accumulation. Although plants increased the density of P solubilizing bacteria, these bacteria alone did not improve plant P nutrition {{as in the case}} of nematode predation. Our results open an alternative route for better utilization of poorly available inorganic P to plants.
