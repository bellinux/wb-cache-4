Beginning in 1884, Sienkiewicz {{accompanied}} his wife Maria to foreign sanatoriums. After her death, {{he kept on}} traveling Europe, leaving his children with his late wife's parents, though he often returned to Poland, particularly staying for long periods in Warsaw and Kraków beginning in the 1890s. After his return to Warsaw in 1887, the third volume of his Trilogy appeared – Pan Wołodyjowski (Sir Michael) – running in <b>The</b> <b>Word</b> <b>from</b> May 1887 to May 1888.

5|$|Fairman {{discusses}} {{the efforts of}} conservatives in the United States to censor <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>from</b> common parlance in the country, and says these acts {{are opposed to the}} First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Fairman warns against a tendency toward self-censorship. He explains that those who choose to silence themselves tacitly encourage a process by which speech is forbidden through the legal process. He argues that this passivity has an impact of increasing the taboo nature of the word.|$|E

25|$|Three {{specific}} {{levels of}} knowledge are often discussed in Christology as beatific, infused and acquired knowledge. Those (such as Thomas Aquinas) who {{adhere to the}} principle of the Perfection of Christ reason that he must have had beatific knowledge of all things from <b>The</b> <b>Word</b> <b>from</b> the very beginning due to his perfection. However, the views of Aquinas are not generally accepted by all Christians.|$|E
25|$|The metacognitive {{perspective}} views TOT states {{simply as}} the awareness felt when such an event occurs {{and the perception of}} the experience involved. Mainly being aware of a TOT state can result in the rapid devotion of cognitive resources to resolving the state and successfully retrieving <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>from</b> memory. Such an explanation leaves much to be desired; however, the psycholinguistic perspective and the metacognitive perspective on TOT states are not mutually exclusive and both are used to observe TOT states in a laboratory setting.|$|E

He discusses uses of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>from</b> the 15th century onwards. Fairman establishes that most current usages have connotations distinct from its denotation of sexual intercourse, and asserts that rather than having sexual meaning, the word's use is most commonly associated with power.|$|E
500|$|Another less {{widespread}} {{theory is}} that the Slavic languages have borrowed <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>from</b> a Turkic term for [...] "witch" [...] (e.g., Tatar ubyr). Czech linguist Václav Machek proposes Slovak verb [...] "vrepiť sa" [...] (stick to, thrust into), or its hypothetical anagram [...] "vperiť sa" [...] (in Czech, the archaic verb [...] "vpeřit" [...] means [...] "to thrust violently") as an etymological background, and thus translates [...] "upír" [...] as [...] "someone who thrusts, bites". An early use of the Old Russian word is in the anti-pagan treatise [...] "Word of Saint Grigoriy" [...] (Russian Слово святого Григория), dated variously to the 11th–13th centuries, where pagan worship of upyri is reported.|$|E

The network agreed, and Roland MacFarland, Fox's vice president of broadcast standards, ordered Scully to cut <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>from</b> the episode or eliminate all reference to religion. Scully refused, and after a long argument, MacFarland offered to replace the protesting denomination with a Protestant substitute – Methodist, Presbyterians or Baptists. Scully then asked MacFarland [...] "What would be the difference changing it to another religion, and wouldn't that just be offending a different group of people?", to which MacFarland replied that Fox had already had trouble with the Catholics earlier that season.|$|E

500|$|Fuck: Word Taboo and Protecting Our First Amendment Liberties is a nonfiction book by law {{professor}} Christopher M. Fairman about freedom of speech, the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, censorship, {{and use of}} the word fuck in society. The book was first published in 2009 by Sphinx as a follow-up on the author's article [...] "Fuck", published in 2007 in the Cardozo Law Review. It cites studies from academics in social science, psychoanalysis, and linguistics. Fairman establishes that most current usages of the word have connotations distinct from its meaning of sexual intercourse. The book discusses the efforts of conservatives in the United States to censor <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>from</b> common parlance. The author says that legal precedent regarding its use is unclear because of contradictory court decisions. Fairman argues that once citizens allow the government to restrict the use of specific words, this will lead to an encroachment upon freedom of thought.|$|E
500|$|Fuck is a 2005 American {{documentary}} film by director Steve Anderson about the word [...] "fuck". The film {{argues that the}} word {{is an integral part}} of societal discussions about freedom of speech and censorship. It examines the term from perspectives which include art, linguistics, society and comedy, and begins with a segment from the 1965 propaganda film Perversion for Profit. Scholars and celebrities analyze perceptions of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>from</b> differing perspectives. Journalist Sam Donaldson talks about the versatility of the word, and comedian Billy Connolly states it can be understood despite one's language or location. Musician Alanis Morissette comments that the word contains power because of its taboo nature. The film features the last recorded interview of author Hunter S. Thompson before his suicide. Scholars, including linguist Reinhold Aman, journalism analyst David Shaw and Oxford English Dictionary editor Jesse Sheidlower, explain the history and evolution of the word. Language professor Geoffrey Nunberg observes that the word's treatment by society reflects changes in our culture during the 20th century.|$|E
500|$|Casting {{announcements}} {{began in}} June 2009 when Noah Wyle was announced as the lead. Wyle, {{who worked with}} TNT on the Librarian films, was sent scripts for various shows on their network. He said {{part of the reason}} he chose the part was to gain credibility from his children. [...] "With the birth of my kids, I started to really look at my career through their eyes more than my own, so that does dictate choice, steering me toward certain things and away from other things," [...] he said. He also decided to do it as he could relate with his character, stating [...] "I identified with Tom's devotion to his sons, and admired his sense of social duty." [...] Spielberg wanted Wyle for the role because he knew him from his previous series ER, which Spielberg's company produced. He had wanted Wyle to appear in his 1998 film Saving Private Ryan but due to scheduling conflicts, he was unable to star. Spielberg stated that he was determined to work with him again. In July 2009, Moon Bloodgood, Jessy Schram, Seychelle Gabriel and Maxim Knight were cast as Anne Glass, Karen Nadler, Lourdes and Matt Mason, respectively. Bloodgood, the female lead, did not have to audition for the role. She received the script and was offered the role. Bloodgood was drawn to the role because of Spielberg and Rodat's involvement. She stated: [...] "Well certainly when you get handed a script and they tell you it’s Bob Rodat and Steven Spielberg, you’re immediately drawn to it. It’s got your attention. I was a little cautious about wanting to do science fiction again. But {{it was more of a}} drama story, more of a family story. I liked that and I wanted to work with Spielberg." [...] Bloodgood added that portraying a doctor excited her. [...] "I liked the idea of playing a doctor and deviating from something I had done already," [...] she said. In August 2009, Drew Roy and Peter Shinkoda were cast as Hal Mason and Dai, respectively. Drew Roy's agent received the script and the pair joked that Roy might get the role. [...] "This one came to me through my agent, just like everything else. We even joked about the fact that it was a Steven Spielberg project. We were like, [...] "Oh yeah, I might have a chance." [...] We were just joking." [...] He auditioned four times for the part. [...] "The whole process went on for quite some time, and then towards the end, it was down to me and one other guy, and we were literally waiting for <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>from</b> Steven Spielberg ‘cause he had to watch the two audition tapes and give the okay. That, in and of itself, had me like, [...] "Okay, even if I don’t get it, that’s just cool." [...] Fortunately, it went my way." ...|$|E
