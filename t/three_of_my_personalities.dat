When I try to form such a conception I discover that, as Coleridge would have said, I only hypostatize a word, and it alters nothing if, with Fichte, I suppose the universe to be nothing but a manifestation <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>personality.</b> I am neither more nor less eternal than I was before.|$|R

While working with clay, I create houses that personify different aspects <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>personality,</b> {{depending on what}} was happening in my life at the time. I also make pots that reflect elements <b>of</b> <b>my</b> environment. My mixed media and digital photography work is a more intimate look at my Middle Eastern heritage from belly dancing to snapshots <b>of</b> <b>my</b> family...|$|R
5000|$|Dalí himself brought Marcel Proust {{into the}} debate, {{whom he had}} already read as a {{juvenile}} and whose writing style - long sentences, metaphors - Dalí practiced, too. But Dalí invoked his name only in a comparison: [...] "It's mustache the most serious part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>personality.</b> It's a very simple Hungarian moustache. Mister Marcel Proust used {{the same kind of}} pomade for this moustache." ...|$|R
40|$|Bachelor Thesis {{based on}} the topic Personal level of Melancholy. From the very {{beginning}} this topic was {{based on the}} fact that this work will touch me personally and will be based on the nature <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> and build on my previous approaches to painting, that were formed during previous studies. My goal was to create abstract paintings, that matched their material meaning and are able to show them in the process of work...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{my glass}} artwork which I make {{to help me}} understand the world. Trees, specifically bonsai trees, are used as inspirational imagery. The work explores the physical and symbolic aspects {{of the trees and}} the relationships that develop between the maker, the object, and the viewer. The series of work split into two distinct styles and the relationships of the styles as they relate to aspects <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> are explored...|$|R
60|$|And {{tonight it}} jarred on {{me more than}} usual, because I was feeling pretty dashed fed with Jeeves. Over that matter of the mess jacket, I mean. True, I had forced him to climb down, quelling him, as described, with the quiet {{strength}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>personality,</b> but I was still a trifle shirty at his having brought the thing up at all. It {{seemed to me that}} what Jeeves wanted was the iron hand.|$|R
60|$|I must iterate that I {{had this}} {{thought in the}} midst <b>of</b> <b>my</b> dreaming, and I take it as an {{evidence}} of the merging <b>of</b> <b>my</b> two <b>personalities,</b> as evidence of a point of contact between the two disassociated parts <b>of</b> me. <b>My</b> dream <b>personality</b> lived in the long ago, before ever man, as we know him, came to be; and my other and wake-a-day personality projected itself, {{to the extent of}} the knowledge of man's existence, into the substance <b>of</b> <b>my</b> dreams.|$|R
5000|$|The {{right to}} what is in essence {{inalienable}} is imprescriptible, since the act whereby I take possession <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>personality,</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> substantive essence, and make myself a responsible being, capable of possessing rights and with a moral and religious life, takes away from these characteristics of mine just that externality which alone made them capable of passing into the possession of someone else. When I have thus annulled their externality, I cannot lose them through lapse of time or from any other reason drawn from my prior consent or willingness to alienate them.|$|R
5000|$|In 1979, {{he added}} his alter ego character, Griffy, to the strip. He {{describes}} Griffy as [...] "neurotic, self-righteous and opinionated, {{someone with whom}} Zippy would certainly contrast. I brought the two characters together around 1979, perhaps symbolically bringing together the two halves <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>personality.</b> It worked. Their relationship seemed to make Zippy's random nuttiness more directed and Griffy's cranky, critical persona had his foil, someone to bounce happily off of his constant analysis of everything and everyone around him." ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{self-described}} [...] "enthusiastic marijuana user," [...] Miller notes other {{similarities between}} himself and Erlich Bachman, his character on Silicon Valley. [...] "He is just sort of, unfortunately for me, a magnification of certain aspects <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>personality,</b> mixed in {{with a couple of}} fictional things...I am, at times, a Falstaffian figure; he very much is that too. We are in line with each other as nihilists: He thinks you should {{tell it like it is}} ... because everybody's opinion including yours doesn't mean anything." ...|$|R
5000|$|Discussing his {{character}} {{in an interview}} with The TV Chick, Overstreet commented: [...] "I think I put a little bit <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> in him. I would say so. I’m such a nice, sweet guy that you don’t even have to act, it's me. I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I'm not that full of myself. It's similar to <b>my</b> <b>personality,</b> I would say. I'm kind of goofy and say stupid things to girls when I’m attracted to them. And when I like them, I say stupid things without thinking like the Avatar stuff, that's very much something I would say." [...] Overstreet said that the writers picked up lines from him and gave them to {{his character}}: ...|$|R
500|$|During an interview, Ryan O'Neal {{recalled}} Kubrick's directing style: [...] "God, {{he works}} you hard. He moves you, pushes you, helps you, gets cross with you, {{but above all}} he teaches you {{the value of a}} good director. Stanley brought out aspects <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> and acting instincts that had been dormant... My strong suspicion [...] that I was involved in something great". He further added that working with Kubrick was [...] "a stunning experience" [...] and that he never recovered from working with somebody of such magnificence.|$|R
500|$|Waldron's own {{assessment}} of his style {{was that it}} was partly a reflection of his personality: [...] "It's part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> to be very economical with what I have and to use it in all variations before I move to the next set of notes". He acknowledged the influences of Holiday (on his conception of space and playing behind the beat), Mingus (for the importance of individuality), and Roach (on the value of time signatures other than the usual 4/4), as well as pianists Duke Ellington, Monk, Powell and Art Tatum.|$|R

40|$|In {{the spring}} quarter of 1988 I became acquainted with {{computer}} graphics which opened up great visual possibilities for me. The computer {{enabled me to}} layer and integrate various photographic fragments of reality, and enhanced my ability to reveal aspects <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> [...] <b>my</b> fears, my desires, and <b>my</b> feeling <b>of</b> confusion between contrasting values within my life. I could now communicate on a more general level, dealing with not just personal but cultural {{issues such as the}} role of mythology in our everyday life and how we deal with all the information that we absorb in modern life...|$|R
40|$|My work {{investigates the}} role and dynamic of society, culture, and {{familial}} influence on the masculinity and femininity within our individuality. It specifically deals with my on going discovery of the masculine side <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>personality,</b> and how the feminine roll is influenced, or not influenced, by this. I have been applying Jungian psychology and the theory of individuation, archetypes, and so forth, to my process. I have made several bodies of work in a quest to understand the fundamental roles that femininity and masculinity have affected my choices and individual understanding. Documenting old and new relationships, I make puppets, create installations, write dialogues, journal, and also collaborate, investigating through dating, family, and friendships...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} a long and arduous journey {{completing}} research but motivation to forge ahead lay in the joy of creating something innovative and giving life to a piece of work that was non-existent not so long ago. Much of the credit must go to Dr. Kristin L. Wood, my supervisor, for his patience and guidance over the last few years. You have my sincere gratitude for innumerable deep and insightful discussions we have had that has resulted in this treatise. More importantly I thank you for the development <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> as a thinker, designer and researcher. I am particularly grateful for extensive learning I have had associating analytical work with practical examples and physical reality...|$|R
5000|$|He came out, he said {{in another}} interview, because [...] "I never hide. I never put that aspect <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> aside. I know so many gay intellectuals or writers who say, 'I {{am not going to}} talk about {{homosexuality}} because it doesn’t interest people.' But for me this makes no sense. It would be like a heterosexual who doesn’t present himself as a heterosexual. I never planned to come out." [...] After Taïa came out publicly, [...] "it took years to overcome the rifts" [...] between him and his family, he told the New York Times in 2014. [...] "They cried and screamed….I cried when they called me. But I won't apologize. Never." ...|$|R
5000|$|In November 2005, Lat {{revealed}} A3G's {{identity in}} an interview with Jeffrey Toobin for the magazine The New Yorker. In the story, Lat gave an explanation for his alter ego: [...] "the blog really reflects two aspects <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>personality,</b> I am very interested in serious legal issues as well as in fun and frivolous and gossipy issues. I can go from the Harvard Law Review to Us Weekly very quickly." [...] After leaving the U.S. Attorney's office in January 2006, Lat became an editor of Washington, D.C. blog Wonkette (at the time, part of the Gawker Media network), formerly run by Ana Marie Cox.

60|$|I dried my eyes after a while, {{and looked}} up in his face. He was very good-looking, and had a charming soft smile. How lucky I should have tumbled upon such {{pleasant}} travelling companions! In my present mental state, I had need of sympathy. And, indeed, they took as much care of me, and coddled me up as tenderly, as if they'd known me for years. I was almost tempted to make a clean breast <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> to them, and tell them why it was I had been so worried and upset by my reception at Quebec: but I shrank from confessing it. I hated my own name, almost, it seemed to bring me such very unpleasant notoriety.|$|R

I bet they don't always want to hear songs about white Christmases and {{bundling}} up 'cause it's cold outside. They {{want to have a}} holiday song they can relate to." [...] Caillat teamed up with writing partners Kara DioGuardi and Jason Reeves to craft the bubbly and admittedly silly track, [...] "Kara started coming up with all these funny lyrics about Santa falling off his surf board and Rudolph playing reindeer games on me," [...] she says.

5000|$|The {{title of}} the album was {{inspired}} by Evans' original nickname with Bad Boy Records, [...] "The First Lady of Bad Boy." [...] On her decision to use a truncated version of the name Diddy dubbed her with, Evans commented: [...] "nickname did carry over, 'cause I'm the first artist in my genre at Capitol," [...] she said. [...] "More so, I chose the title The First Lady because a lot <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> reminds me <b>of</b> people like Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Hillary Clinton. ... Of course, they go through things, 'cause they're human like all of us. But {{when you see the}} first lady, you regard her as being the first lady. ...

40|$|Boots-and-me is an ethno-sensual {{narrative}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{life with}} some rock-climbing boots and more specifically, my feet within them. It explores my physical, sensual engagement with these items of sports equipment, spanning {{a period of}} twenty-eight years. The story is a stylised form of writing with frequent, colourful use of analogies for a more vivid interpretation. From this sense-laden and textured narrative, a deeper story is revealed about aspects <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> and character. Establishing that my feet are connected to my head(!) leads to critical consideration of some ideas emerging from the tale; shared experiences in research. A short prologue introduces the main story; Boots-and-me, followed by an epilogue of theoretical analysis and discussion from respondents to the story. It is concluded that physically and emotionally rich auto-accounts about how people {{come to rely on}} items of equipment may be a window to some of their life-management strategies...|$|R

2500|$|By the mid-1970s, Ronstadt's image became just {{as famous}} as her music. In 1976 and 1977, she {{appeared}} {{on the covers of}} Rolling Stone and Time, respectively. The Rolling Stone cover story was accompanied by a series of photographs of Ronstadt in a skimpy red slip, taken by Annie Leibovitz. Ronstadt felt deceived by the photographer, not realizing that the photos would be so revealing. She says her manager Peter Asher kicked Leibovitz out of the house when she visited to show them the photographs prior to publication. Leibovitz had refused to let them veto any of the photos, which included one of Ronstadt sprawled across a bed in her underpants. In a 1977 interview, Ronstadt explained, [...] "Annie [...] saw that picture as an expose <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>personality.</b> She was right. But I wouldn't choose to show a picture like that to anybody who didn't know me personally, because only friends could get the other sides of me in balance." ...|$|R
