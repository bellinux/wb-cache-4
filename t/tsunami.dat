5|$|Archaeologists {{believe that}} the brick shrine was {{destroyed}} either by a cyclone or a <b>tsunami</b> which took place 2,200 years ago. The Pallavas built a granite temple on the brick foundation in the 8th century AD, which also was {{likely to have been}} destroyed by a <b>tsunami.</b> Archaeologists {{believe that the}} second <b>tsunami</b> must have occurred in the 13th century AD as the latest inscriptions which speak of the shrine have been dated to 1215.|$|E
5|$|In 1833 a large {{earthquake}} on {{the west}} coast of Sumatra struck up a <b>tsunami</b> which destroyed much of Padang. The mosque was one of several buildings which survived the <b>tsunami.</b> Its stone floor was later replaced by a mixture of clam shells and pumice.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 2004 Asian <b>tsunami,</b> U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed Clinton to head a relief effort. After Hurricane Katrina, Clinton joined with fellow former president George H. W. Bush to establish the Bush-Clinton <b>Tsunami</b> Fund in January 2005, and the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund in October of that year. As part of the <b>tsunami</b> effort, these two ex-presidents appeared in a Super Bowl XXXIX pre-game show, and traveled to the affected areas. They also spoke together at the funeral of Boris Yeltsin in April 2007.|$|E
30|$|If the {{evidence}} regarding <b>tsunamis</b> in folklore or historical documents is reliable, {{it appears that}} the boulders in this region were moved by past <b>tsunamis.</b> However, we have no data to suggest that the boulders on Lanyu Island were transported by <b>tsunamis.</b> Thus, we conclude that the boulders were moved by storm waves, particularly those associated with typhoons. Based on the numerical simulation, the boulders could not have been moved by the <b>tsunamis,</b> but instead could have been moved by storm waves. This suggests that the boulders moved by <b>tsunamis</b> would be relocated by storm waves, if the runup heights of the <b>tsunamis</b> were less than 10 to 15  m, which is almost equal to that of the computed <b>tsunamis.</b>|$|R
50|$|There is also {{evidence}} of accompanying <b>tsunamis</b> with every earthquake. One strong line {{of evidence for}} these earthquakes is convergent timings for fossil damage from <b>tsunamis</b> in the Pacific Northwest and historical Japanese records of <b>tsunamis.</b>|$|R

5|$|In <b>tsunami</b> prone regions, strong {{earthquakes}} {{serve as}} familiar warnings, {{and this is}} especially true for earthquakes in Indonesia. Previous estimates of the <b>tsunami</b> hazard for the Java coastline may have minimized the risk to the area, and to the northwest along the Sumatran coast, the risk is substantially higher for <b>tsunami,</b> especially near Padang. Previous events along the coast of Java in 1921 and again in 1994 illustrate the need for an accurate assessment of the threat. The July 2006 earthquake had an unusually slow rupture velocity which resulted in minor shaking on land for around three minutes, but the intensity was very light relative to the size of the <b>tsunami</b> that followed.|$|E

5|$|Japan has 108 active volcanoes. During {{the twentieth}} century several new volcanoes emerged, {{including}} Shōwa-shinzan on Hokkaido and Myōjin-shō off the Bayonnaise Rocks in the Pacific. Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in <b>tsunami,</b> occur several times each century. The 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people. More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, a 9.1-magnitude quake which hit Japan on March 11, 2011, and triggered a large <b>tsunami.</b> Japan is substantially prone to earthquakes, <b>tsunami</b> and volcanoes due to its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire. It has the 15th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2013 World Risk Index.|$|E
25|$|The Cook Inlet region {{contains}} active volcanoes, including Augustine Volcano and Mount Redoubt. Volcanic eruptions in {{the region}} have been associated with earthquakes and <b>tsunamis,</b> and debris avalanches have resulted in <b>tsunamis</b> also. There was an earthquake of the magnitude of 7.1 on December 31, 1901 generated by an eruption that caused several <b>tsunamis.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{catalog of}} about ninety <b>tsunamis</b> in the Indian Ocean has been {{prepared}} from 326 BC to 2005 AD.

These zones are subduction zones or zones of compression...|$|R
30|$|Since {{the most}} common sources for <b>tsunamis</b> are earthquakes, earthquake-generated <b>tsunamis</b> have been {{extensively}} investigated. Landslide-generated <b>tsunamis</b> have been much less studied and the existing knowledge about them is more limited. They are characterized by relatively short periods, compared to the earthquake-generated ones, {{and they do not}} travel as long distances as the earthquake-generated <b>tsunamis</b> do. Therefore, one of their characteristics is that their whole life cycle takes place near the source. Nevertheless, they can reach high amplitudes and can also become extremely harmful (see [1, 2]).|$|R
5|$|Most of the {{casualties}} and damage were caused by a <b>tsunami</b> affecting the west coasts of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, {{and it was one}} of three tsunamis to occur within a span of six months. Runup heights were measured shortly after the earthquake and reached heights of up to 9.9 meters, though the average height was 3 to 8 meters. The <b>tsunami</b> was disproportionately large for its surface wave magnitude, or Ms, and the duration of the rupture process was 100 s, unusually long for its size. The moment magnitude was 7.6, larger than the 20-s Ms of 7; this Ms–Mw difference is a characteristic of <b>tsunami</b> earthquakes. Tide gages were set up at Corinto and Puerto Sandino, which showed an impulsive <b>tsunami</b> originating 61 minutes after the earthquake. It ran inland 1,000 meters to Masachapa, the hardest hit major town of all, with 9 fatalities.|$|E
5|$|Officials in Indonesia {{received}} {{information regarding}} the <b>tsunami</b> {{in the form of}} bulletins from the Pacific <b>Tsunami</b> Warning Center and the Japan Meteorological Agency, but wanted to avoid panic, and did not attempt to disseminate the advisories to the public. Virtually no time was available to make that sort of effort (had the intention been to communicate the danger with the public) because some community leaders were sent text messages with pertinent information only minutes prior to the arrival of the first waves. The <b>tsunami</b> affected the coast of Java comprising mostly fishing villages and beach resorts that were unscathed following the 2004 Indian Ocean <b>tsunami,</b> and was also only several hundred kilometers distant from the region that saw heavy destruction just several months prior during the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Several locally {{generated}} <b>tsunamis</b> {{have been}} reported in Southern California during the past 200 years, yet the hazard from locally generated <b>tsunamis</b> has received considerably little attention. We consider here <b>tsunamis</b> generated by coseismic displacements on the Channel Is-lands Thrust (CIT) system, as well as waves generated by slope failures along the walls of the Santa Barbara Chan-nel. We nd that purely tectonic sources could generate regional <b>tsunamis</b> with 2 m runup, whereas combinations of tectonic sources and submarine mass movements could generate local runup as large as 15 m...|$|R

However, the boulders might have been transported not by <b>tsunamis,</b> but by storm waves. Therefore, in this paper, we reproduce storm waves using numerical simulation and clarify whether the boulders could have been transported by storm waves.|$|R

5|$|Just as {{with other}} waves, moving into shallow water causes the <b>tsunami</b> to slow but grow in height. Either the trough or {{the crest of the}} <b>tsunami</b> can arrive at the coast first. In the former case, the sea draws back and leaves subtidal areas unusually exposed. When the crest arrives, it does not usually break but rushes inland, {{flooding}} all in its path. Much of the disaster's destruction can be produced by these flood waters, which drain back into the sea while pulling people and debris along. Several tsunamis can be caused by a single geological event. In such cases, it is common for the later waves to arrive between eight minutes and two hours after the first, which may not be the biggest or most destructive. Occasionally, in a shallow bay or estuary, a <b>tsunami</b> may transform into a bore.|$|E

30|$|Obviously, this cannot {{rule out}} the {{possibility}} that the boulders on Lanyu Island could have been transported by <b>tsunamis.</b> However, the computed flow velocities of <b>tsunamis</b> that originated in the area of the Ryukyu Trench were too small to move the boulders. This suggests that the boulders could not be moved by <b>tsunamis</b> if Mw 8.7 earthquakes occurred in the Ryukyu Trench. Moreover, the possibility that the boulders would be moved by storm waves with a 50 -year return period is much greater than the possibility that the boulders would be moved by <b>tsunamis,</b> because the occurrence of <b>tsunamis</b> is rare near Lanyu Island. <b>Tsunamis</b> observed at Lanyu Island since 1950 have typically been about 0.1  m high (Lau et al. 2010). The absence of any significant <b>tsunamis</b> since that date suggests that <b>tsunamis</b> of equivalent height to storm waves with a 50 -year return period occur less often than such storm waves. Radiocarbon dating of the boulders at LD (Figure  12 B) and LX (Figure  15 B) provided dates of Cal AD 1670 to 1810 and Cal BC 4320 to 4160, respectively. This suggests that the event that transported the boulder at LD onto land occurred sometime after 340  years ago. The age of the boulder at LX is similar to that of the lower coral terrace (Inoue et al. 2011), which suggests that the lower coral terrace was broken and transported at LX. Although the event at LX would be estimated as occurring sometime after 6, 330  years ago, the detail has not yet been determined.|$|R

40|$|Historical data {{is used to}} {{determine}} those sections of shorelines in the Hawaiian Islands {{most likely to have}} the largest runup values for Pacific-wide <b>tsunamis.</b> Accurate modeling of these sections of shorelines are essential for regional evacuation determinations for small <b>tsunamis.</b> Potentially important areas are identified for each of the major Hawaiian Islands. For <b>tsunamis</b> originating in the North Pacific (i. e., the Kamchatka, Aleutian, and Alaska portion of the circum- Pacific arc), the most critical areas appear to be the shorelines around Haena, Kaena Point, Haleiwa, Waimea, Kahakuloa, Kahului, Pololu, Waipio, and Hilo. Other coastal areas having large runups are identified. For <b>tsunamis</b> originating elsewhere along the circum-Pacific arc, more data is needed for a comprehensive determination of critical shoreline areas. However, for <b>tsunamis</b> originating in South America, available runups indicate that Haleiwa, Kahului, and Hilo may have some of the largest values on their respective islands and that some of the largest values on Kauai may be found along its northern and southern shores.
