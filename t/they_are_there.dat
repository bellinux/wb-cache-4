5|$|Over {{a four-month}} period, Berkley Books {{published}} three young adult novels written by Kelly O'Rourke; the novels are original stories created by O'Rourke, with no direct continuity with the films. The first, released on October 1, 1997, titled The Scream Factory, follows {{a group of}} friends who set up a haunted house attraction in the basement of Haddonfield City Hall, only to be stalked and killed by Michael Myers while <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>there.</b> The Old Myers Place is the second novel, released December 1, 1997, and focuses on Mary White, who moves into the Myers house with her family. Michael returns home and begins stalking and attacking Mary and her friends. O'Rourke's final novel, The Mad House, was released on February 1, 1998. The Mad House features a young girl, Christine Ray, who joins a documentary film crew that travels to haunted locations; they are currently headed to Smith Grove Mental Hospital, where they are confronted by Michael.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Tintin finds {{electric}} cables and red beacons in the garden, surmising that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> designed {{to attract a}} plane drop. At night, he lights the flares, and finds that planes drops sacks of counterfeit money, revealing that Müller {{is part of a}} gang of forgers. He pursues Müller and his accomplice Ivan and along the way, Thompson and Thomson try to arrest him again, but he convinces them to follow him. When Müller takes a plane north, Tintin and Snowy try to follow, but hit a storm and crash land in rural Scotland. The detectives commandeer another plane, but discover too late that the man they told to fly it is actually a mechanic who has never flown before, and after a harrowing air-bound odyssey they end up crash-landing into (and winning) an aerobatics competition.|$|E
5|$|The first book, The Quest Begins, {{shows how}} {{each of the}} four bears are either {{abandoned}} or separated from their parents. Kallik is separated from her mother and brother when a pod of orcas (killer whales) eat her mother, while her brother was still {{on the other side of}} the canal, thinking they were both dead. After this, Kallik travels to find her brother. Toklo is abandoned by his mother after his brother, Tobi, dies and his mother sees how the salmon is disappearing, and left Toklo to travel alone. Lusa was born and raised in a zoo. Her story intertwines with Toklo's after his mother is brought to the zoo and Lusa hears of the wild. Hoping to leave her home, she escapes the zoo and looks for Toklo. Meanwhile, Toklo finds Ujurak injured and helps him; they begin to travel together. They meet up with Lusa at the end of the book. By Great Bear Lake, the four bears have joined together and they try to go to the Arctic. Although Kallik finds her brother Taqqiq, he has joined a group of bullying bears who kidnap a black bear cub. Taqqiq sees that what he did was wrong and joins the questing bears but he soon leaves the group in the third book when he feels he does not belong with them. The remaining four cubs learn of a place called the Last Great Wilderness in the third book, where there is plentiful food and shelter. After defying hardships such as hunger and bear hunters, they finally make it to the Last Great Wilderness. However, even though <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>there,</b> Ujurak, who leads the journey, feels that they need to go further, into the Arctic. In Fire in the Sky, the bears leave the Last Great Wilderness and travel towards the Arctic. In the sixth and final book of the first series, Spirits in the Stars, the four bears make it to Star Island, a place where many polar bears live. They find a sick mother polar bear and her cub. The mother dies from sickness and the four bears look after her cub. Toklo finds that he also struggles with his urge to become a brown bear and travel alone. The bears save the polar bears that inhabit Star Island by destroying an oil rig that was poisoning the seals that they eat, but Ujurak dies in an avalanche while saving the others. Yakone, a young white bear who lived on the strange Star Island with the sick bears, is added to the group of bears on the last page of the book.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> beyond evasion. No {{affidavit}} {{could do}} away with the fearful smell of decayed oysters, the diving-dresses, and the shell-littered hatches. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> to the value of seventy thousand pounds, more or less; and every pound poached.|$|R
60|$|The great throng sat silent, {{listening}} intently, {{their eyes}} fixed upon the speaker. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> for a purpose; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> {{to find out}} why it was that their toil, their sobriety, their self-deprivation, left them at middle life with distorted and stiffened limbs, gray hair, and empty hands. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> terribly in earnest, and Bradley felt his kinship with them. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> his kind.|$|R

25|$|Concert-like {{performances}} are a prominent {{feature of the}} Ghost Festival in Singapore and Malaysia. Those live concerts are popularly known as Getai 'Koh-tai' by Hokkien-speaking people. They are performed by groups of singers, dancers and entertainers on a temporary stage that is set up within a residential district. The festival is funded by the residents of each individual district. During one of these 'Getai', it {{is known to be}} bad luck to sit on the front row of red seats, as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> only for the Ghosts themselves. If anyone were to sit on them, they would become sick or similarly ailed.|$|E
25|$|In the film, where Harry and Hermione have {{travelled}} back in {{time and}} are hiding outside of Hagrid's hut, it is heavily implied that Dumbledore somehow knows that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>there,</b> as he distracts the other characters at key moments or slows down the proceedings (such as by suggesting that he sign Buckbeak's execution order as well, then after Fudge agrees he says it will take some time as he has an extremely long name), which allows Harry and Hermione time to free Buckbeak unseen. In the book, Dumbledore merely comments that the executioner must sign the order, right before he is about to leave the cabin to execute Buckbeak.|$|E
25|$|On Apokolips, the Challengers are {{confused}} {{as to why}} <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> as Palmer says it is not connected to the Great Disaster. Jason tires of their bickering and leaves. Upon seeing Brother Eye, Jason contemplates using it to get back home. While searching for Jason, the Challengers find Mary, Harley, Holly and then Karate Kid, just after Brother Eye removes the Morticoccus virus from him. The group, along with Jason, prepares to confront Brother Eye, who uses a Boom Tube {{to send them to}} Apokolips' surface. The group is caught in the shockwave of Apokolips' destruction just as they are about to be attacked by an army of OMACs.|$|E
50|$|Sergei Sergeyevich Prokofiev and {{his wife}} Mira Aleksandrovna Mendel'son-Prokofieva spent about three months at Ivanovo during the summers of 1944 and 1945 to escape the {{constraints}} of wartime Moscow. In 1944 <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> from June 9 and left on August 27 back to Moscow by train. In 1945 <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> from around June 20 until October when they hurried back to Moscow because of the imminent premiere of his ballet Cinderella.|$|R

25|$|They don't respect {{our culture}} because we didn't give {{permission}} {{for someone to}} carve the sacred Black Hills where our burial grounds <b>are.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> for us to enjoy and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> for us to pray. But it wasn't meant to be carved into images, which is very wrong for all of us. The more I think about it, the more it's a desecration of our Indian culture. Not just Crazy Horse, but all of us.|$|R
25|$|At this time, Ives {{was also}} {{promoted}} by Bernard Herrmann, {{who worked as}} a conductor at CBS and in 1940 became principal conductor of the CBS Symphony Orchestra. While there, he championed his music. When they met, Herrmann confessed that he had tried his hand at performing the Concord Sonata. Remarkably, Ives, who actually avoided the radio and the phonograph, agreed to make a series of piano recordings from 1933 to 1943 that were later issued by Columbia Records on a special LP set issued for his centenary in 1974. New World Records issued 42 tracks of his recordings on CD on April 1, 2006. One of the more unusual recordings, made in New York City in 1943, features him playing the piano and singing the words to his popular World War I song <b>They</b> <b>Are</b> <b>There!,</b> which he composed in 1917, then revised in 1942–43 for World War II.|$|E
25|$|In episode 2, Kat and Alfie {{are invited}} to Lance's wake by Peter, and when {{speaking}} to Agnes and Lance's daughter, Eileen Harrington (Angeline Ball), Kat realises that Andrew cannot be her son. Agnes confronts Kat and Alfie, so Kat realises that Lance told her why <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>there.</b> Agnes says Kat gave up her right to see her son when she gave him up, but Kat explains {{she did not know}} she had a son as she had passed out during the birth. Dermott and Tommy hear this, and Tommy asks if he has a big brother. Later, Kat and Alfie decide to return to Spain, but Tommy wants to find his brother. Tommy sneaks out of the house, and Kat and Alfie try to find him. Andrew's mother, Roisín Kelly (Maria Doyle Kennedy), tells Kat that she saw Tommy at the church, so they go there, followed by Agnes. They find Dermott praying with Tommy, who tells Kat that he found his brother. Kat realises that Dermott is her son, and Dermott confirms this. In episode 3, Kat and Dermott have bonded, but she lies to him about who his real father is. Dermott worries that Tommy will tell Peter the truth and threatens him. Alfie realises that Kat lied to Dermott, which results in an argument. Dermott overhears them arguing about him not knowing the truth and Kat refusing to tell him.|$|E
25|$|A {{few weeks}} after the start of the pre-season, yet {{prior to the start of}} the {{competitive}} season, the club opens its doors for free for all Feyenoord fans to have fun together and to present the squad for the upcoming season. De Kuip already opens in the morning when there are many activities around the stadium mainly for kids and promotional activities for companies which have a partnership with Feyenoord. Fans can also take a stadium tour and walk on the pitch. The activities inside the stadium itself normally start around noon, when there are several performances by various artists. Every year, the new Feyenoord ambassador of the year is announced at opening day. A minute of silence is held for all former Feyenoord players who have died and for known fans who have died in the previous year. Former Feyenoord players return to De Kuip every year to play versus a team of Dutch celebrities. The stadium activities end after the squad for the upcoming season is presented to the fans. This is always a special happening, mainly for the new signings of the team. They will be flown into the stadium with helicopters when a full stadium is cheering for them when they arrive. Once <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>there,</b> the other players and club officials enter the pitch one by one. Last but not least, all players are available for autograph sessions afterwards. Feyenoord's open day attracts approximately 60,000 to 70,000 fans towards Rotterdam, coming from all over the Netherlands, while there are only 51,117 seats available within the stadium. The opening day is known as a unique event in the Netherlands.|$|E

50|$|Foch {{was in no}} mood to {{compromise}} and greeted the delegation: What do you want from me?. The Germans stated that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> to negotiate an armistice. Foch replied that as far as he <b>was</b> concerned <b>there</b> would <b>be</b> no negotiation - <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> to receive his terms. A meeting was arranged for the next day from whence the Germans would have 72 hours, from the 8th to 11th, to agree to Foch's terms; Erzberger suggested an immediate ceasefire but this was refused by Foch.|$|R

[...] In a further show of respect, the students step [...] "off the wood" [...] (step off of the bleachers onto the concrete) whenever a player is injured or when the band plays the Aggie War Hymn or The Spirit of Aggieland. [...] At {{the end of the}} Aggie War Hymn, fans sway back and forth, causing the upper deck of the stadium to move.

500|$|Deodato filmed Cannibal Holocaust {{using the}} cinéma vérité {{technique}} {{he learned from}} his mentor Roberto Rossellini, a style which production designer Massimo Antonello Gelend called [...] "hyperrealistic." [...] Film historian David Kerekes contends that the film's sense of reality {{is based on the}} direction and the treatment of the film team's recovered footage, noting that the [...] "shaky hand-held camerawork commands a certain realism, and 'The Green Inferno,' the ill-fated team's film-within-a-film here, is no exception," [...] and that [...] "this very instability gives the 'Green Inferno' film its authentic quality." [...] David Carter of the cult horror webzine Savage Cinema says that Deodato's methods added a first-person quality to the film team's footage, claiming, [...] "The viewer feels as if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> with the crew, experiencing the horrors with them." [...] Deodato was proud of other aspects of the cinematography, namely the numerous moving shots using a standard, shoulder-mounted camera, foregoing the use of a steadicam.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the {{vacation}} season, the Phanceys entrust Viv with looking after the motel for the night before the owner, Mr. Sanguinetti, can arrive to take inventory and close it up for the winter. Two mobsters, [...] "Sluggsy" [...] Morant and Sol [...] "Horror" [...] Horowitz, both of whom work for Sanguinetti, arrive and say <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> to look over the motel for insurance purposes. The two have been hired by Sanguinetti to burn down the motel so that Sanguinetti can make a profit on the insurance. The blame for the fire would fall on Viv, who was to perish in the incident. The mobsters are cruel to Viv and, when she says she does not want to dance with them, they attack her, holding her down and starting to remove her top. They are about to continue the attack with her rape when the door buzzer interrupts them.|$|E

500|$|... "New York" [...] is the twenty-second episode {{and season}} finale {{of the second}} season of the American musical {{television}} series Glee, and the forty-fourth overall. The episode was {{written and directed by}} series creator Brad Falchuk, filmed in part on location in New York City, and first aired on May 24, 2011 on Fox in the United States. With a $6million budget, it was reportedly the most expensive episode of Glee at the time of broadcast. It garnered a Primetime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Costumes for a Series. The episode features an appearance by Patti LuPone as herself and guest stars Jonathan Groff, Cheyenne Jackson, and Charice. The McKinley High School glee club, New Directions, performs at the National show choir competition in New York City and finishes in twelfth place. While <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>there,</b> the glee club members see the sights, including Times Square and Central Park. Rachel (Lea Michele) and Kurt (Chris Colfer) sing a song from a Broadway stage, as does their director, Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison).|$|E

Whannell initially did not give Wan the reaction he was looking for. He said, [...] "I'll never forget that day. I remember hanging up the phone and started just going over it in my head, and without any sort of long period of pondering, I opened my diary that I had at the time and wrote the word 'Saw'." [...] Before instantaneously writing the word [...] "Saw" [...] in a blood-red, dripping font, the two had not come up with a title.

Marshall, on a patrol to locate the King, learns <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> and quickly rides to the village {{with a group of}} his soldier friends. Hopkins, however, having earlier learned that Sara was in Lavenham, has set a trap to capture Marshall. Hopkins and Stearne frame Marshall and Sara as witches and take them to the castle to be interrogated. Marshall watches as needles are {{repeatedly}} jabbed into Sara's back, but he refuses to confess to witchcraft, instead vowing again to kill Hopkins. He breaks free from his bonds and stamps on Stearne's face, {{at the same time that}} his army comrades approach the castle dungeon. Marshall grabs an axe and repeatedly strikes Hopkins. The soldiers enter the room and are horrified to see what their friend has done. One of them puts the mutilated but still living Hopkins out of his misery by shooting him dead. Marshall's mind snaps and he shouts, [...] "You took him from me! You took him from me!" [...] Sara, also apparently on the brink of insanity, screams uncontrollably over and over again.|$|E

500|$|After the tour, Bradman {{was full}} of praise for Miller, {{although}} somewhat critical of his aggressive batting, which the Australian captain thought to be reckless: [...] Bradman criticised Miller's hitting of sixes (26), feeling that his mercurial all rounder lacked restraint and concentration. In contrast, Fingleton praised Miller's attitude to cricket, saying [...] "He is never one to accept runs when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> for the taking...I acknowledge myself the supreme believer in Miller as a cricketer. He had given me joy in the game approached by others." [...] With respect to his persistent bouncing of Hutton and Compton, Fingleton {{said that it was}} up to England to develop bowlers of express pace—which they lacked at the time—to retaliate against or deter the Australians from pursuing such tactics. Miller's persistent disagreements with Bradman soon caught up with him, despite the latter's retirement after the tour. During Bradman's testimonial match, Miller bowled three consecutive bouncers at his retired captain, dismissing him with the last of these and drawing an angry look. Bradman was one of three members of the national selection panel, and Miller was dropped for the next series against South Africa in 1949–50. Although Bradman denied voting for the omission, most of the players in the team did not believe this.|$|E
