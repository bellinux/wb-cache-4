5|$|Another {{characteristic}} {{attributed to}} the ala is extreme voracity; in the Leskovac region, she was imagined as a monster with a huge mouth and a wooden spoon in her hand, with which she grabbed and devoured whatever came her way. According to a widely spread tradition, ale used to seize children and devour <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> dwelling, which was full of children’s bones and spilt blood. Less often, they attacked and ate adults; {{they were able to}} find a hidden human by smell.|$|E

After she hears her father and stepmother come in, she sees her friends {{in the mirror and}} realizes even though she is growing up, she still needs <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> life every now and again. In an instant, a number of the major characters from the Labyrinth appear in her room for a raucous celebration, and she reunites with Hoggle, Ludo, Didymus, and Ambrosius. As they celebrate, Jareth, in his owl form, watches from outside and then flies away into the night.|$|E

5|$|The {{damaging}} {{effects of}} ionising radiation were not {{known at the}} time of her work, which had been carried out without the safety measures later developed. She had carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket, and she stored <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> desk drawer, remarking on the faint light that the substances gave off in the dark. Curie was also exposed to X-rays from unshielded equipment while serving as a radiologist in field hospitals during the war. Although her many decades of exposure to radiation caused chronic illnesses (including near-blindness due to cataracts) and ultimately her death, she never really acknowledged the health risks of radiation exposure.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Crown Jewels—which mainly {{date from}} the {{accession}} of Charles II—the jewels are not official regalia or insignia. Much of the collection was designed for queens and queen consorts, though some kings have added to the collection. A few diamonds {{were brought to the}} United Kingdom from the British colonies and far away lands as the spoils of war. Most of the jewellery was purchased from other European heads of state and members of the aristocracy, or handed down by older generations of the Royal Family, often as birthday and wedding presents. In recent years, Elizabeth has worn <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> capacity as Queen of Australia, Canada and New Zealand, and can be seen wearing jewels from her collection in official portraits made specially for these realms.|$|E

25|$|The myth of Huitzilopochtli {{is uniquely}} Aztec. Huitzilopochtli is {{therefore}} {{considered to be}} the cult god or the patron god of the Aztec. As a solar deity, Huitzilopochtli is closely related to and overlaps with Tonatiuh. Huitzilopochtli’s mother was Coatlicue, or She of the Serpent Skirt. Coatlicue, known for her devout nature and virtuous qualities, was at Mount Coatepec or Coatepetl ("Serpent Hill"; near Tula, Hidalgo) one day, sweeping and tending to her penance, when she discovered a bundle of feathers on the ground.
