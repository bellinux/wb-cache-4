5|$|Even {{before the}} Chicago Fire, <b>the</b> <b>block</b> {{was home to}} one of Chicago's largest theaters. During the late 19th century, tall office {{buildings}} proliferated on <b>the</b> <b>block.</b> By 1970, <b>the</b> <b>block</b> was densely developed with 11 buildings, housing theaters, offices, a YMCA, and retailers like Stop & Shop, a grocer. On June 14, 1973, Mayor Richard J. Daley announced a broad urban renewal initiative centered on the North Loop theater district. Over the ensuing 16 years, numerous private developers, notably the Rubloff Company and JMB Realty, planned large mixed-use developments on the site, with a mall along State Street and hotels and office towers above. Property assembly was facilitated by Mayor Harold Washington's creation of the North Loop tax increment financing district in 1983, which gave the urban renewal effort a steady revenue stream and eminent domain authority.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> three <b>blocks</b> model {{images are}} shown in Figure  7 a-g. It is worth {{mentioning}} that the geometries of <b>the</b> <b>blocks</b> are fairly resolved in all the images. On the basis of fitness to model, <b>the</b> reconstructed <b>blocks</b> from images of dipole-dipole inverse models and combined maximum values nearly fit the position of <b>the</b> true <b>blocks</b> indicated by solid lines. For all the images, the reconstructed resistivity values of <b>the</b> three <b>blocks</b> are underestimated. This {{is a reflection of}} the effect of the background resistivity on <b>the</b> <b>blocks.</b> In spite of this underestimation, the mean resistivity values of <b>the</b> three <b>blocks</b> for dipole-dipole inverse model and combined maximum values image are closer to the true resistivity of <b>the</b> <b>blocks</b> while <b>the</b> images of Wenner inverse models and the combined minimum values of the three inverse models are not very close to the true resistivity of <b>the</b> three <b>blocks</b> (Table  2). Furthermore, the vertical displacement of <b>the</b> <b>blocks</b> from <b>the</b> center of <b>the</b> true <b>blocks</b> is provided in Table  3. It is observed that <b>the</b> <b>blocks</b> appear deeper than <b>the</b> true <b>blocks</b> for this model. The displacement of <b>the</b> <b>blocks</b> from <b>the</b> true <b>blocks</b> is least for image of maximum followed by dipole-dipole while Wenner and minimum images are considerably displaced from <b>the</b> true <b>blocks.</b> <b>The</b> estimated errors both MAE and MAPE as measure of accuracy of the images are presented in Tables  4 and 5. For <b>the</b> three <b>blocks,</b> both MAE and MAPE give the least error indexes for maximum image followed by image of dipole-dipole inverse model in attempting to reconstruct <b>the</b> three <b>blocks</b> of <b>the</b> model. Consequently, the maximum image gives the best representation of <b>the</b> three <b>blocks</b> model followed by dipole-dipole image.|$|R

5000|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>blocks</b> were {{classified}} as mixed-level radioactive waste, including plutonium, Rockwell International was unable to store <b>the</b> <b>blocks</b> in <b>the</b> Nevada Test site.
