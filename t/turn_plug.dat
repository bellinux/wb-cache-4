In a simple home network, the Internet gateway router connects via Ethernet cable to a powerline adapter, which in <b>turn</b> <b>plugs</b> into a nearby power outlet. A second adapter, plugged into any other outlet in the home, connects via Ethernet cable to any Ethernet device (e.g., computer, printer, IP phone, gaming station). Communications between the router and Ethernet devices are then conveyed over existing home electrical wiring. More complex networks can be implemented by plugging in additional adapters as needed. A powerline adapter may also be plugged into a hub or switch so that it supports multiple Ethernet devices residing in a common room.|$|R

50|$|The {{output from}} a DJ mixer is {{typically}} plugged into a sound reinforcement system or a PA system at a dance, rave, nightclub or similar venue or event. The sound reinforcement system consists of power amplifiers which amplify {{the signal to}} the level that can drive speaker enclosures, which since the 1980s typically include both full-range speakers and subwoofers for the deep bass sounds. If the DJ is performing a mix for a radio station or television station, the output from the DJ mixer is plugged into the main audio console being used for the broadcast. If the DJ is performing a mix that is being recorded by a recording studio, the output from the DJ mixer is plugged into the main audio console used for the recording, which is in <b>turn</b> <b>plugged</b> into the recording medium (audiotape, hard disk, etc.). In some cases, such as when a DJ is performing a set at a club for dancers that is also being simultaneously broadcast over the radio or television system or recorded for a music video or other show, the output from the DJ mixer is plugged into the sound reinforcement system and into the main audio console being used for the broadcast and/or recording. At club sets, some DJs may use a monitor speaker to hear the house's main mix. This monitor speaker can have its volume increased or decreased by the DJ as needed.|$|R
50|$|Some {{high-end}} {{monitors and}} video cards featured 5 separate BNC connectors for RGBHV signal, allowing highest quality connection using five 75 ohm coaxial cables. Within a 15-pin connector, the red, green, and blue signals (pins 1, 2, 3) cannot be shielded from each other, so crosstalk is possible within the 15-pin interconnect. BNC prevents crosstalk by maintaining full coaxial shielding through the circular connectors, but the connectors are {{very large and}} bulky. The requirement to press and <b>turn</b> the <b>plug</b> shell to disconnect requires access space around each connector to allow grasping of each BNC plug shell. Supplementary signals such as DDC are typically not supported with BNC.|$|R

50|$|With solid plugs, a tube or area exists {{above and}} below the bevel and <b>turning</b> the <b>plug</b> {{controls}} access. In a number of cases it is convenient to fully remove a plug which can give access to the region beyond the bevel. Plugs are generally made of an inert plastic such as PTFE and are attached to a threaded sleeve {{in such a way that}} the sleeve can be turned without spinning the plug. The contact with the bevel is made by an O-ring fitted to the tip of the plug or by the plug itself. There are a few examples where the plug in made of glass. In the case of glass plugs, the joint contact is always a rubber O-ring but they are still prone to shattering.|$|R
50|$|However, the {{electrical}} <b>plugs</b> <b>turned</b> out {{to not be}} the only problem with the booster. Examination of telemetry also showed that the Titan had actually began experiencing thrust decay before the plug dropped out. Engine No. 1 was unaffected and nearly reached 100% thrust at shutdown, while Engine No. 2 never transitioned to in-flight performance levels. Engineers spent all night combing through the first stage, but failed to find any cause for the thrust decay. Eventually however, one technician identified the problem, which was a plastic dust cover inside the gas generator that had been carelessly left inside when the booster was assembled months earlier at the Martin-Marietta plant, blocking the flow of oxidizer. The cover was removed and the Titan II cleared for another launch attempt.|$|R

50|$|The memory battery (aka motherboard, CMOS, {{real-time}} clock (RTC), clock battery) is generally a CR2032 lithium coin cell. This cell battery has an estimated life of 3 years when {{power supply unit}} (PSU) is unplugged or when the PSU power switch is turned off. Other common battery cell types can last significantly longer or shorter periods, such as the smaller CR2016 which will generally last about 40% less time than CR2032. Higher temperatures and longer power-off time will shorten battery cell life. When replacing battery cell, the system time and CMOS BIOS settings may revert to default values. Unwanted BIOS reset may be avoided by replacing battery cell with PSU power switch <b>turned</b> on and <b>plugged</b> into electric socket on the wall.

40|$|The use of polymer {{layers to}} alter the impact {{response}} of metallic plates has emerged recently as an effective and economical means to enhance perforation resistance. However, {{the function of the}} polymer in such laminate systems remains unclear. In this investigation we aim to identify, through systematic experiments, the influence of a polymer layer on the perforation mechanisms and energy absorption of laminated plates. In particular, we consider the combination of a polymer with a thin metallic plate in a bi-layer configuration, subjected to either quasi-static or impact loading by a blunt indenter. Bi-layers are investigated which comprise an aluminium alloy layer (6082 -T 6) and a polyethylene layer (LDPE, HDPE and UHMWPE). It is found that the energy required to perforate the bi-layer plate can significantly exceed that of the bare metallic substrate (showing the potential for polymer coatings as an effective retro-fit solution) when the polymer is on the impacted face. Furthermore, bi-layer configurations are also shown to outperform the equivalent mass of monolithic metal if the correct thickness ratio of polymer and metal is selected. The effectiveness of a polymer layer in enhancing perforation energy is connected to its large ductility, allowing extensive deformation of the polymer under the indenter, which in <b>turn</b> suppresses <b>plugging</b> and diffuses plastic deformation in the metal layer. In this way the energy absorbed by the metal layer can be maximised. The thickness of the polymer layer is found to be a crucial parameter in maximising the effectiveness of the bi-layer target. An optimum polymer thickness is observed which maximises energy absorption per unit mass of bi-layer target (for a fixed substrate thickness). The synergy between metal and polymer layers also depends on the polymer type and the rate of loading. A polymer with high strain hardening performs best under impact conditions. However, under quasi-static loading, the bi-layer performance is less sensitive to the yield strength and strain hardening of the polymer.

40|$|There was an {{explosive}} {{growth in the}} bioprocess industry market during the last decade. The tight control of these processes is often very critical in order to optimize the process efficiency or even achieve the right product. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) system is a good option for process monitoring and controlling, since {{it has already been}} proved to be a powerful analytical tool used in laboratory situations. However the extremely high separation voltage required by CE operation is preventing the system miniaturization and integration, and thus hindering its way to in-line application. Therefore, in this work, two low-voltage separation methods are proposed and investigated with the aim of substituting the conventional microfluidic CE. In the first DEP method, the curved parts of a serpentine channel are effectively used for dielectrophoretic separation. The second method moving field CE is basically an evolution version of the traditional CE, in which the required separation voltage is significantly reduced by decreasing the span of the electrodes in the channel. For the DEP method, the curves are the essential parts where the dielectrophoretic separation takes place. A DC-biased AC electric field allows small particle separation in a curve as the dielectrophoresis is decoupled from the electroosmosis. The separation sensitivity was found to have a second order dependence on the ratio of AC to DC amplitudes and a linear dependence on the particle size. The separation resolution is limited by the Brownian motion and is voltage dependent. Since the curves are bended in the opposite directions, the separation will be wiped out in the next curve. Therefore, focusing must be conducted to bring all the particles to the same entering point for the next curve. In terms of focusing, the top-and-bottom electrode structure performs superior to the planar array for negative DEP because stronger electric field gradients are generated and particles are forced away from walls where nonuniform flow and nonspecific particle adhesion can occur. Because the hydrodynamic flow profile in a curve also decreases monotonously from the channel center to the outer sidewall, the same device can be used for both hydrodynamic and electrokinetic DEP separation. The hydrodynamic DEP,bearing a higher flow gradient, is expected to produce a larger separation than the electrokinetic DEP. The DEP device was fabricated by bonding of two processed substrates with an SU- 8 layer sandwiched in between. The retention time of 2 µm and 4 µm PS particles in a channel segment containing 4 curves was measured in the case of hydrodynamic DEP. The 4 µm particles turn out to take an average 10 % longer retention time than the 2 µm particles, which proves the concept. It was revealed that applying a DC voltage over a fraction of the channel will evoke flow distortion in moving field CE operation, and will in <b>turn</b> cause <b>plug</b> dispersion and peak broadening. For a given voltage, the smaller fraction it is applied on, the larger flow distortion will be caused in the EOF region. By extracting and analyzing the equivalent circuits of the fluid system, the flow distortion was found to be the consequence of a backward flow. The method we proposed is to generate, by coupling an electroosmotic pump (EOP), a forward flow and compensate the backward flow in the EOF segment. Specific pump structures were designed to relieve the driving voltage to the same level as the separation voltage. They are an array of slender channels and a broad thin channel. In order to minimize the flow loss, the channel arrays are proposed {{to be used in the}} injection channels as well to increase the flow resistance. The moving field CE prototype device was fabricated by laminating two layers of dry film resist on a processed glass substrate. The first layer is used to define the channel structure and the second acts as the lid of the channel. The flow distortion compensation was observed when the EOP driving voltage was increased to a certain level. The required EOP driving voltages with respect to different separation voltages were measured, which exhibit a linear relationship as expected. To detect cells at extremely low concentrations, we additionally proposed a biomass concentration detection method in which an electrokinetic technology is used for rapidly increasing the concentration of the cells while measuring the concentration. Due to the dielectric contrast between the viable cell and the surrounding medium, the cells could be trapped and accumulated by positive dielectrophoresis. Based on the simplified homogeneous sphere model, the frequency dependence of the induced dipole strength of the yeast cell was studied by computer methods. The threshold DEP forces required to dominate over the Brownian motion for cell trapping were investigated. To achieve accurate and sensitive detection, a contactless 4 -electrode conductivity detector was suggested to be used. Readout circuits and measurement setups were verified by using ideal resistors to mimic the environment of a liquid suspension. This method is recommended to be further investigated by using viable yeast cells in future research.
