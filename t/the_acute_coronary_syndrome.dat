40|$|The role of {{platelets}} and the clotting {{system in}} the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis has received significant attention. Most importantly, platelets and thrombosis play {{a pivotal role in}} the pathogenesis of <b>the</b> <b>acute</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>syndromes</b> of unstable angina, myocardial infarction and sudden death. In each stage of the development of coronary artery disease, from the early symptomatic stage through the growing lesion and finally to the complicated plaque that results in the precipitation of <b>the</b> <b>acute</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>syndromes,</b> platelets and <b>the</b> clotting system serve as a common link among them. Antithrombotic therapy aimed at halting the progression of these syndromes, preventing their occurrence or even reversing them (such as {{in the early stages of}} acute myocardial infarction), has provided exciting new modalities to treat these disorders. The use of aspirin in unstable angina in two well designed studies has clearly shown a reduction in fatal as well as nonfatal cardiac events compared with control groups not treated with aspirin. Although demonstration of a benefit of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy is difficult owing to a low event rate of thrombotic events (low sensitivity) and other nonthrombotic fatal events (low specificity) after myocardial infarction, pooled results have shown a favorable effect with their use. The usefulness of thrombolytic therapy in the early stages of acute myocardial infarction depends on the timing of initiation of therapy, the severity of the residual stenosis and possible use of agents that protect the ischemic myocardium. Other potential therapies for <b>the</b> <b>acute</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>syndromes</b> are also suggested.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, {{significant}} advances {{have been made}} in the understanding of the pathogenesis of coronary atherosclerotic disease. Two facts are important: 1) the early and some of the advanced coronary atherosclerotic lesions progress very slowly, probably by means of a complex stepwise biologic process with one of the steps being an interaction between platelets and the arterial wall; the process can be favored by the so-called risk factors of atherosclerotic disease, and 2) some of the advanced coronary atherosclerotic lesions progress very rapidly, probably by means of complicating anatomic events, one of which is related to a thrombogenic process.
