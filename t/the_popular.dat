40|$|The {{current study}} {{investigated}} how perceived popularity and collaboration quality {{were associated with}} knowledge gain of adolescents during a collaborative learning task. Participants included 264 children ages 10 - 12 years (52. 3 % boys), who collaborated 3 times in same-sex dyads on a computer assignment. Results indicated that the knowledge of <b>the</b> more <b>popular</b> member at Time 1 predicted knowledge gain of <b>the</b> less <b>popular</b> member at Time 2. Furthermore, mutual listening, reported by either member of the dyad, had {{a positive effect on}} the knowledge gain of <b>the</b> less <b>popular</b> member, whereas dominance of <b>the</b> more <b>popular</b> member negatively affected the knowledge gain of <b>the</b> less <b>popular</b> member. These findings suggest that prior knowledge of <b>the</b> more <b>popular</b> dyad member affects the learning of <b>the</b> less <b>popular</b> dyad member and that the quality of the collaboration between both dyad members appears to affect the outcome for <b>the</b> less <b>popular</b> dyad member; more mutual listening and less dominance presumably ensures equal participation and likely increases the chances of <b>the</b> less <b>popular</b> dyad member to participate sufficiently in the collaboration process...|$|R
