5|$|While {{the initial}} steer torque and steer angle are both {{opposite}} the desired turn direction, {{this may not}} be the case to maintain a steady-state turn. <b>The</b> <b>sustained</b> steer angle is usually in the same direction as the turn, but may remain opposite to the direction of the turn, especially at high speeds. <b>The</b> <b>sustained</b> steer torque required to maintain that steer angle is usually opposite the turn direction. The actual magnitude and orientation of both <b>the</b> <b>sustained</b> steer angle and sustained steer torque of a particular bike in a particular turn depend on forward speed, bike geometry, tire properties, and combined bike and rider mass distribution. Once in a turn, the radius can only be changed with an appropriate change in lean angle, and this can be accomplished by additional countersteering out of the turn to increase lean and decrease radius, then into the turn to decrease lean and increase radius. To exit the turn, the bike must again countersteer, momentarily steering more into the turn in order to decrease the radius, thus increasing inertial forces, and thereby decreasing the angle of lean.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, <b>the</b> <b>sustained</b> rise in {{oil prices}} had only a limited impact on demand. It was a good year across all {{segments}} of the tanker market segments, but {{not as good as}} 2004 and 2005. Amidst high oil prices, geopolitical tension, and fears of disruptions to the oil supply, growing demand was the main driving force in the tanker shipping market for the year. As demand grew moderately in the United States and Western Europe, expanding economies such as China fueled exponential growth in demand. Despite these strengths, each of the five tanker freight indices dropped during 2006. Product tanker demand increased in 2006 due to economic expansion in Asia, especially China and India, however, average time charter equivalent earnings for these ships decreased compared with the two prior years.|$|E

5|$|On October10, Hazel slowed in {{the central}} Caribbean and turned sharply to the {{north-northeast}} toward Hispaniola, steered by an upper-level low. At 09:00UTC on October12, the hurricane made landfall near Chardonnières along the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.

5|$|After {{maintaining}} its peak intensity for about 36hours, Francisco began weakening, after the eye lost definition due to building wind shear. By October21, the eye became ragged and cloud-filled while the overall satellite {{presentation of the}} storm became elongated. That day, the typhoon entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), which gave Francisco the local name Urduja; the agency would cease issuing advisories on October23. Conditions generally remained favorable, allowing the eye to remain distinct despite a great reduction in <b>the</b> <b>sustained</b> winds. Dry air began affecting the tropical cyclone late on October22, cutting off the flow of moist air, and water temperatures cooled along the storm's track. As a result, the eye dissipated and the convection weakened. An approaching trough from the Korean peninsula weakened the ridge to the north, slowing the typhoon and allowing it to turn north and northeast on October24. Francisco weakened below typhoon status after passing 210km (130mi) southeast of Okinawa. The storm began interacting with the approaching cold front while it passed south of Japan, moving around the subtropical ridge. With increasing wind shear, the circulation became exposed from the convection, and the JTWC discontinued advisories on October25, declaring that Francisco was becoming extratropical. On the next day, Francisco completed its extratropical transition, but dissipated later on October26, to the southeast of Japan.|$|E

The next day cyclone Gene started to temporarily weaken again by becoming a category two cyclone with winds speeds of 95km/h (60mph 10 min). This came as cyclone Gene approached 25°S which marks the edge of RSMC Nadi's area of responsibility, {{to the south of}} 25°S the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) in Wellington, New Zealand, monitors tropical cyclones, south of 25°S. As Gene crossed in to TCWC Wellington's area of responsibility, Cyclone Gene started to re-intensify becoming a severe tropical cyclone again with peak winds of 120km/h (105mph 10 min) however this re-intensification only lasted for 12 hours before Gene began to weaken for the final time by becoming a tropical cyclone that day. Gene slowly weakened {{over the next couple of}} days as it moved towards the south east.

5|$|The {{attack on}} the gap began at 7:30am on 11 August, as a flight of Savioa-Marchetti SM.81 medium bombers {{attacked}} British defenders on Punjab Ridge.

40|$|The {{width of}} an address {{electrode}} {{is an important}} parameter to affect both <b>the</b> address and <b>sustain</b> discharge characteristics in AC-PDP. It is found numerically that as the width of an address electrode is wider, the capacitance between <b>the</b> <b>sustain</b> and address electrodes (CAY) increases but the capacitance between <b>the</b> two <b>sustain</b> electrodes (CXY) decreases. The resultant changes in <b>the</b> <b>sustain</b> and address discharge characteristics, such as a firing voltage, sustain voltage, discharge delay time and full-white luminance were examined in the 50 -in. ac-PDP with a high Xe (> 10 %) content. The increase in the address electrode width causes an increase in <b>the</b> firing and <b>sustain</b> voltage between <b>the</b> <b>sustain</b> electrodes, which are due to the decrease in the capacitance between two <b>sustain</b> electrodes and <b>the</b> increase in the wall charges accumulation toward the address electrode. In particular, the full-white luminance increases {{with an increase in}} the address electrode width. As the address electrode width becomes broaden, <b>the</b> <b>sustain</b> discharge path is lengthened toward the address electrode and the discharge volume is also enlarged. Therefore, the amount of the IR, VUV and Ne rays can be emitted considerably. 1...|$|R

5|$|The {{movement}} {{opens with}} an extensive orchestral sinfonia marked Concerto in the autograph score. Lasting 22 bars, this ritornello establishes the prevailing anguished {{mood of the}} first section. It is heard twice again, but only as the accompanying backdrop for the separate musical material of the chorus, a setting of the first phrase of the Old Testament text. The open motifs are also heard again in the fragmentary accompaniment of the central choral fugato episode between the two reprises of the ritornello. The different motifs in the ritornello thus also serve the purpose of accompanying specific parts of the text. The first predominant motif consist of detached repeated quaver chords, passed antiphonally between the three instrumental groups of recorders, oboes and strings. These are accompanied by similarly detached crotchets, scored as quavers with rests, in the walking bass of the continuo. After thirteen bars there follows a four bar passage of melifluous semiquaver passages in thirds for the recorders with imitative responses from the oboes; the upper strings take up the detached crotchets and the continuo the groups of detached repeated quavers. In the four succeeding bars the quaver figure in the continuo line {{is replaced by a}} new motif of rising semiquaver scales, with the detached quavers and crotchets passing into the upper strings and the woodwind playing sustained chords. In the concluding two bars of the sinfonia the semiquaver scale motif passes into the recorders in thirds and is taken up by the other instruments for <b>the</b> <b>sustained</b> final cadence.|$|E
