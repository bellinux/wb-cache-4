5|$|Foliot {{supported}} his uncle Robert de Chesney's nomination to become Bishop of Lincoln, lobbying the pope on Robert's behalf, {{and maintaining a}} long correspondence with Robert after his elevation. <b>The</b> <b>letters</b> <b>to</b> this uncle are full of warm sentiments, more than would be expected of a dutiful correspondence. Other episcopal correspondents and friends included Roger de Pont L'Évêque, the Archbishop of York, Josceline de Bohon, the Bishop of Salisbury, and William de Turbeville, the Bishop of Norwich, who became a regular correspondent after Foliot was translated to London.|$|E

5|$|Bungie first {{introduced}} the Halo series publicly in 1999 by sending the Cortana Letters, {{a series of}} cryptic email messages, to the maintainer of marathon.bungie.org, a fan site for one of Bungie's previous series, the Marathon Trilogy. The strategic use of cryptic messages in a publicity campaign was repeated in I Love Bees, a promotion for Halo 2. Although Bungie does not consider most of <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> <b>to</b> be canon, Cortana speaks {{many of the same}} lines in Halo 3. According to C. J. Cowan, Bungie's director of cinematics, the studio used the character here to give story clues without actually revealing the story.|$|E
5|$|Ilsa confronts Rick in {{the deserted}} café. When {{he refuses to}} give her the letters, she threatens him with a gun, but then confesses that she still loves him. She {{explains}} that when they met and fell in love in Paris in 1940, she believed her husband had been killed attempting to escape from a concentration camp. While preparing to flee with Rick from the imminent fall of the city to the German army, she learned Laszlo was alive and in hiding. She left Rick without explanation to nurse her sick husband. Rick's bitterness dissolves. He agrees to help, letting her believe she will stay with him when Laszlo leaves. When Laszlo unexpectedly shows up, having narrowly escaped a police raid on a Resistance meeting, Rick has waiter Carl spirit Ilsa away. Laszlo, aware of Rick's love for Ilsa, tries to persuade him to use <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> <b>to</b> take her to safety.|$|E
5|$|The {{letter to}} Æthelburg {{makes it clear}} that she was already married at the time the news of Eadbald's {{conversion}} reached Rome. This is quite inconsistent with the earlier date Bede gives for Eadbald's acceptance of Christianity, and it has been suggested in Bede's defence that Æthelburg married Edwin substantially earlier and stayed in Kent until 625 before travelling to Rome, and that the letter was written while she was in Kent. However, it would appear from Boniface's letter that Boniface thought of Æthelburg as being at her husband's side. It also appears that the letter to Justus was written after <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> <b>to</b> Edwin and Æthelburg, rather than before, as Bede has it; Boniface's letter to Edwin and Æthelburg indicates he had the news from messengers, but when he wrote to Justus he had heard from the king himself.|$|E

25|$|On Cameron's return, the Emperor became enraged when {{he found}} out that Cameron had not taken <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> London personally, had not brought a {{response}} from the Queen, and most of all, had spent time traveling through enemy Egyptian and Turkish territories. Cameron tried to appease the Emperor saying that a reply <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> would arrive shortly. The Foreign Office in London did not pass <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> Queen Victoria, but simply filed it under Pending. There <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> stayed for a year.

5|$|When Crèvecœur {{offered his}} {{manuscript}} essays to the London publishers Davies & Davis in 1782, they were initially {{skeptical about the}} potential for <b>the</b> <b>Letters</b> <b>to</b> be successful. However, the work proved to be instantly popular in England for a variety of reasons. Proponents of political reform such as William Godwin and Thomas Paine approved of the radical anti-government implications of its message. Romantic writers admired, and were influenced by, its evocation of the natural landscape and the individual's relationship to it. More widely, in the final years of the Revolutionary War, the public was eager for the documentary detail Letters provided about America. The popularity of the book led to a second edition being called for only a year later.|$|E

Then he even had to rearrange the order of <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> <b>to</b> produce meaningful words. The text, if taken as meaningful, is of religious, perhaps liturgical character.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the book}} Hvem er skrivekuglens opfinder? (English: Who is the {{inventor}} of the Writing Ball?), written by Malling-Hansen's daughter, Johanne Agerskov, in 1865, Malling-Hansen made a porcelain model of the keyboard of his writing ball and experimented with different placements of <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> <b>to</b> achieve the fastest writing speed. Malling-Hansen placed the letters on short pistons that went directly through the ball and down to the paper. This, together with the placement of the letters so that the fastest writing fingers struck the most frequently used letters, made the Hansen Writing Ball the first typewriter to produce text substantially faster than a person could write by hand.|$|E
