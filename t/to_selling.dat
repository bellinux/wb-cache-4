5|$|After {{dropping}} the hardware business, NeXT returned <b>to</b> <b>selling</b> a toolkit {{to run on}} other operating systems, in effect returning to the original business plan. New products based on OpenStep were released, including OpenStep Enterprise, a version for Microsoft's Windows NT. The company also launched WebObjects, a platform for building large-scale dynamic web applications. Many large businesses including Dell, Disney, WorldCom, and the BBC used this WebObjects software for a short time. Today, WebObjects is used almost solely to power Apple's iTunes Store {{and most of its}} corporate Web site.|$|E
5|$|Colt did not refrain long from manufacturing, {{and turned}} <b>to</b> <b>selling</b> {{underwater}} electrical detonators and waterproof cable {{of his own}} invention. Soon after {{the failure of the}} Patent Arms Manufacturing Company, he teamed up with Samuel Morse to lobby the US government for funds. Colt's waterproof cable, made from tar-coated copper, proved valuable when Morse ran telegraph lines under lakes, rivers, bays, and in his attempts to lay a telegraph line under the Atlantic Ocean. Morse used the battery from one of Colt's mines to transmit a telegraph message from Manhattan to Governors Island when his own battery was too weak to send the signal.|$|E
5|$|Nokian Tyres {{concentrates}} on the consumer car and vehicle tyre replacement and premium snow tyre markets; they do not supply automobile manufacturers tyres for new car production. The greater prices consistently found in those markets result in higher profitability compared {{to the rest of}} the tyre industry. The company also produces retreading materials and tyre pressure monitors. It also previously manufactured bicycle tyres but currently licenses the Nokian name on bicycles tyres to another Finnish company. The Vianor retail tyre store chain, which services cars in addition <b>to</b> <b>selling</b> tyres, is owned by Nokian Tyres PLC.|$|E

5|$|With the {{exception}} of the bookseller and apothecary, the scholarly gentry class did not engage in trade professions, since scholars and government officials viewed the merchant class as lowly and contemptible. Sympathetic to the plight of farming peasants who had lost their land, a court edict of 94 CE stipulated that farming peasants who had been reduced <b>to</b> <b>selling</b> wares as street peddlers were not to be taxed as registered merchants, since the latter were heavily taxed by the state. Registered merchants, the majority being small urban shopkeepers, were obligated to pay commercial taxes in addition to the poll tax.|$|E
5|$|On 2 June 2003 U.S. {{authorities}} {{requested the}} Mexican government to extradite Francisco Rafael. A Mexican federal judge approved the request the following year, but the drug lord was extradited to the United States on 16 September 2006. He was flown from Matamoros, Tamaulipas, via helicopter {{and handed over}} to U.S. authorities in a prison in Brownsville, Texas, after a 10-year sentence in Mexico. He was then transferred {{to the state of}} California pending federal charges on drug trafficking. On 18 June 2007, he pleaded guilty to the possession and distribution of cocaine before U.S. District Judge Irma E. Gonzalez in a San Diego federal court. In his testimony, he admitted <b>to</b> <b>selling</b> about 250 grams of cocaine to a supplier who negotiated with an undercover Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent in an unnamed motel in San Diego in 1980. In October 2007, Francisco Rafael was sentenced to six years in prison and with possibility to parole in four months given the time he had already served in prison.|$|E
50|$|Retailers {{that operate}} both in brick-and-mortar and {{ecommerce}} must {{decide on a}} daily basis how to allocate inventory to their stores as part of their merchandise planning processes. These decisions are integral for retailers because they directly affect how their customers interact with their merchandise, and therefore, their brand. The decisions that these strategies help make are what <b>to</b> <b>sell,</b> where <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> it, when <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> it, who <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> it <b>to,</b> and how much <b>to</b> <b>sell.</b> The various assortment strategies most commonly used by retailers and the benefits of using them are explored below.|$|R

5|$|The UAAI badge-engineered cars first {{introduced}} in 1989 sold in far fewer numbers than anticipated, but the Holden Commodore, Toyota Camry, and Corolla were all successful when sold under their original nameplates. The first generation Nova and the donor Corolla were produced at Holden's Dandenong, Victoria facility until 1994. UAAI was dissolved in 1996, and Holden returned <b>to</b> <b>selling</b> only GM products. The Holden Astra and Vectra, both designed by Opel in Germany, replaced the Toyota-sourced Holden Nova and Apollo. This {{came after the}} 1994 introduction of the Opel Corsa replacing the already available Suzuki Swift as the source for the Holden Barina. Sales of the full-size Holden Suburban SUV sourced from Chevrolet commenced in 1998—lasting until 2001. Also in 1998, local assembly of the Vectra began at Elizabeth, South Australia. These cars were exported to Japan and Southeast Asia with Opel badges. However, the Vectra did not achieve sufficient sales in Australia to justify local assembly, and reverted to being fully imported in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Wilkinson opened Wallace's Book Store in June 1965 after a local {{stockbroker}} {{helped him}} raise the initial capital needed through a public stock offering. By this time, Kentucky had adopted free textbook legislation {{at the behest}} of Governor Julian Carroll, so Wilkinson transitioned <b>to</b> <b>selling</b> college textbooks to students at the University of Kentucky. Throughout the 1960s, Wilkinson refused to pay the state sales tax on his transactions; he and Joe Kennedy, the owner of Kennedy Book Store, both claimed that paying the tax put them at a competitive disadvantage with the university's book store, which did not pay state taxes because it was operated by the university, a tax exempt entity. In 1977, the state Board of Tax Appeals ruled that all three bookstores should have been paying the tax, but by this time, the statute of limitations had expired, and none of the three were required to pay any back taxes. Wallace's Book Store continued to expand rapidly, opening retail stores in twenty-eight states and becoming one of the country's largest book firms. In January 1971, he considered issuing more stock to raise capital to buy Providence, Rhode Island-based Barnes & Noble, but the executive committee of Wallace's was averse to purchasing a company so far away and blocked the move. In April 1977, Wilkinson was cited for false and misleading advertisement in conjunction with claims made in radio ads for Wallace's Book Store claiming they were offering the first discounts in history on new college textbooks. In a court filing, Wilkinson admitted the claims were untrue, promised to stop airing the ads, and agreed to refund any money overpaid by customers.|$|E
