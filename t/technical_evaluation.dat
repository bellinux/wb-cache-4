5|$|Mercury-Atlas 8 (MA-8) was {{the fifth}} United States manned space mission, part of NASA's Mercury program. Astronaut Walter M. Schirra Jr., orbited the Earth six times in the Sigma 7 {{spacecraft}} on October 3, 1962, in a nine-hour flight focused mainly on <b>technical</b> <b>evaluation</b> rather than on scientific experimentation. This was the longest U.S. manned orbital flight yet achieved in the Space Race, though well behind the several-day record set by the Soviet Vostok 3 earlier in the year. It confirmed the Mercury spacecraft's durability ahead of the one-day Mercury-Atlas 9 mission that followed in 1963.|$|E
5|$|After a <b>technical</b> <b>evaluation</b> of {{the nine}} {{original}} bids, the top five were shortlisted on 18 May 2004, becoming official candidates. The remaining applicant cities—Havana, Istanbul, Leipzig and Rio de Janeiro—were eliminated. Four of the five candidate cities were prominent national capitals, which lent an increased competitive interest to the final bidding phase. Paris and Madrid earned the top scores during the application phase, but in early 2005, a more thorough evaluation of the candidates put Paris and London in a close race that became tighter as the final vote approached. On 6 July 2005, in a four-round exhaustive ballot of the IOC (gathered at the 117th IOC Session in Singapore), Moscow, New York City and Madrid were eliminated {{in the first three}} rounds. London won the final round by a margin of four votes over Paris and secured the right to host the 2012 Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The host {{city for}} an Olympic Games is usually chosen {{seven to eight}} years ahead of their celebration. The process of {{selection}} is carried out in two phases that span a two-year period. The prospective host city applies to its country's National Olympic Committee; if more than one city from the same country submits a proposal to its NOC, the national committee typically holds an internal selection, since only one city per NOC can {{be presented to the}} International Olympic Committee for consideration. Once the deadline for submission of proposals by the NOCs is reached, the first phase (Application) begins with the applicant cities asked to complete a questionnaire regarding several key criteria related to the organisation of the Olympic Games. In this form, the applicants must give assurances that they will comply with the Olympic Charter and with any other regulations established by the IOC Executive Committee. The evaluation of the filled questionnaires by a specialised group provides the IOC with an overview of each applicant's project and their potential to host the Games. On the basis of this <b>technical</b> <b>evaluation,</b> the IOC Executive Board selects the applicants that will proceed to the candidature stage.|$|E

25|$|By 15 July 2003, the {{deadline}} for interested cities to submit bids to the International Olympic Committee (IOC), nine cities had submitted bids to host the 2012 Summer Olympics: Havana, Istanbul, Leipzig, London, Madrid, Moscow, New York City, Paris, and Rio de Janeiro.

The fear of protest is mitigated by having sufficient procurement lead time and by source selection experience, and increased by protest risk. Fear of protest increases compromised <b>technical</b> <b>evaluations,</b> added procurement lead time, and transaction costs, while it decreases contracting officer authority and is associated with source selection method inappropriateness. Compromised <b>technical</b> <b>evaluations,</b> in turn, decrease contractor performance while contracting officer authority increases contractor performance.
