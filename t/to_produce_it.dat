5|$|Though {{it was one}} of {{the three}} first {{elements}} to be synthesized in the Big Bang, lithium, together with beryllium and boron, is markedly less abundant than other elements.

One month post the release of his action film Sivaji in June2007, he approached Shah Rukh Khan for the lead in Robot. Khan was about <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>it</b> under his own banner, Red Chillies Entertainment, but in October the same year the project was officially aborted due to creative differences between the two.|$|E

5|$|Cooked {{tarantula}} spiders {{are considered}} a delicacy in Cambodia, and by the Piaroa Indians of southern Venezuela. Spider venoms may be a less polluting alternative to conventional pesticides as they are deadly to insects but the great majority are harmless to vertebrates. Possible medical uses for spider venoms are being investigated, {{for the treatment of}} cardiac arrhythmia, Alzheimer's disease, strokes, and erectile dysfunction. Because spider silk is both light and very strong, attempts are being made <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>it</b> in goats' milk and in the leaves of plants, by means of genetic engineering.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, after Estonia regained independence, {{the country}} {{underwent}} a {{restructuring of the}} economy, causing {{the collapse of a}} large part of the heavy industry sector. This collapse led to a decrease in the consumption of electricity and thus a decrease in the need for the oil shale that was mined <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>it.</b> Electricity and shale oil export to former Soviet markets largely ceased. Due to a decrease in demand, the Tammiku and Sompa mines closed in 1999 and those at Kohtla and Ahtme closed in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Michel's plan to {{sell his}} camera to the Swiss Army failed, as {{he was unable to}} find a {{manufacturer}} <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>it</b> in quantity; only about 100 of his cameras were constructed. After the outbreak of the Second World War Michel patented a shell and harness for the transport of items such as film rolls by carrier pigeon. Between 2002 and 2007 three of his cameras were auctioned by Christie's in London.|$|E

Although Np2O5 was initially subject to several studies that claimed <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>it</b> with mutually contradictory methods, it was eventually prepared successfully by heating neptunium peroxide to 300-350°C for 2–3 hours or by heating it under a layer of water in an ampoule at 180°C.|$|E
5|$|The 'defects' of one organ are {{remedied}} by {{the structure}} of another. The elephant has, Paley argues, a short neck because its head is so heavy, but in compensation it has a long trunk, enabling it to reach out. Similarly the spider has no wings to enable it to chase its flying prey, but has a web, and organs adapted <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>it,</b> which compensates for the lack.|$|E

Its pilot was hosted by Jim Caldwell, but Wink Martindale took over as host for the actual series, in {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>producing</b> <b>it</b> (coincidentally, Jim had replaced Wink after 7 years as the host of on Tic-Tac-Dough).|$|R

5|$|Two {{pilots were}} filmed. Fascinated by mathematicians, creators Cheryl Heuton and Nicolas Falacci {{decided to create}} a show about one. With the {{encouragement}} of CBS development executives, they wrote several pilots revolving around mathematicians and scientists, including the pilot for Numb3rs, {{over the course of}} 14 years. Knowing that mathematics would not be readily accepted by the general public on its own, Heuton and Falacci in 2003 decided to use the police procedural format to facilitate the acceptance. When Falacci and Heuton pitched the pilot, CBS agreed <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>it</b> about halfway through their presentation.|$|E

5|$|After being {{signed by}} Mercury Records, the New York Dolls {{released}} their self-titled debut album in 1973 to poor sales. Although it was praised by critics, {{the band was}} not satisfied with producer Todd Rundgren's sound for the album and had disagreements with him before choosing not to retain him. Songwriting and production partners Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller were originally enlisted to produce their next album, while the band's guitarist Johnny Thunders wanted <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>it</b> himself. However, Leiber and Stoller withdrew shortly before recording was to begin. The group held a single session with Mercury A executive Paul Nelson at Media Sound Recording Studios, where they recorded 14 songs, {{most of which were}} covers.|$|E

5|$|Baxter {{was born}} in Wales, but grew up in England, {{entering}} the University of Birmingham at age 16. He joined Imperial Chemical Industries as a chemical engineer, and became head of the Central Laboratory of its General Chemicals Division in Widnes, investigating the chemistry of chlorine and fluorine. He {{was elected to the}} Widnes Municipal Council in 1939, a seat he held until 1949. During the Second World War he provided James Chadwick with samples of uranium hexafluoride for Tube Alloys, the British wartime nuclear weapons program, and later established a pilot plant <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>it</b> in Widnes. In 1944, in response to a request from the Americans for someone with expertise in both uranium chemistry and industrial operations, he went to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to assist the Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|During {{his tenure}} on Why Don't You?, Davies oversaw the {{production}} of a story that took place in Loch Ness. The story was the precursor for his first freelance children's project: Dark Season. The show, originally called The Adventuresome Three, would feature the Why Don't You? characters in a purely dramatic setting that was influenced by his childhood. He submitted the script {{to the head of the}} BBC's Children's department, Anna Home, and Granada Television. Both companies were interested in producing the show with minor changes: Granada wished <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>it</b> as one six-part serial, as opposed to Davies' plan of two three-part serials; and Home was interested in accepting the show on the condition it included a new cast of characters. He accepted Home's offer, and the show was allocated the budget and timeslot of Maid Marian and her Merry Men, which had been put on hiatus the year before.|$|E
5|$|In early 1950, Disney {{produced}} Cinderella, his studio's first animated {{feature in}} eight years. It was popular with critics and theater audiences. Costing $2.2million <b>to</b> <b>produce,</b> <b>it</b> earned nearly $8million {{in its first}} year. Disney was less involved {{than he had been}} with previous pictures because of his involvement in his first entirely live-action feature, Treasure Island (1950), which was shot in Britain, as was The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men (1952). Other all-live-action features followed, many of which had patriotic themes. He continued to produce full-length animated features too, including Alice in Wonderland (1951) and Peter Pan (1953). From the early to mid-1950s, Disney began to devote less attention to the animation department, entrusting most of its operations to his key animators, the Nine Old Men, although he was always present at story meetings. Instead, he started concentrating on other ventures.|$|E
