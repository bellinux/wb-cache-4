40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review is to cover various aspects related {{with the use of}} ion {{exchange}} resins for <b>taste</b> <b>masking</b> of bitter drugs and for formulating sustained release dosage form. Ion exchange resins are water insoluble cross-linked polymers containing a salt-forming group at repeating positions on the polymer chain and have the ability to exchange counter-ions within aqueous solutions surrounding them. The bitterness of pharmaceutical medicines plays a critical role in patient compliance, as the oral administration of bitter drugs is often hampered by their unpleasant taste which leads to non-compliance and further worsening of diseased condition. One of the popular approaches in the <b>taste</b> <b>masking</b> of bitter drugs is based on IER. For <b>taste</b> <b>masking</b> purpose weak cation exchange or weak anion exchange resins are used, depending on the nature of drug. The drug resin complex is absolutely tasteless with no after taste, and at the same time, its bioavailability is not affected. Sustained release dosage forms are designed to release a drug at a pre determined rate in order to maintain a constant drug concentration for a specific period of time with minimum side effects.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to mask the bitter taste of praziquantel. The product into which the taste masked {{formulations}} were to be incorporated was an oral paste intended {{for the treatment of}} cats. Four different approaches to achieve <b>taste</b> <b>masking</b> were tested. First of all, microspheres with the active ingredient being embedded into a polymer matrix consisting of Eudragit E were produced. Moreover, <b>taste</b> <b>masking</b> as a result of complexation with β-cyclodextrin was tested as the formation of a true inclusion complex of praziquantel in β-cyclodextrin could be demonstrated. Another technique included incorporation into lipid microparticles. Finally, praziquantel being a racemic drug the isolated enantiomers were tested separately for their acceptance. The taste masked formulations were then incorporated into different pastes (bases: water, Miglyol or PEG) according to their properties and the acceptance by cats was tested. A poor result was scored for the Eudragit E microspheres in PEG which was mainly caused by the solubility of the active ingredient in this base. The drug-β-cyclodextrin complex and the lipid particles were both tested in Miglyol and water. In an oily paste rather low acceptance values were scored whereas in an aqueous paste satisfactory levels were reached. These could be increased slightly upon addition of a ﬂavor. This result could be equaled with an in situ formed complex between praziquantel and β-cyclodextrin in an aqueous paste which was desired due to production and registration purposes. The separated praziquantel enantiomers were also tested in water and signiﬁcantly different values were reached for them with (−) -praziquantel being preferred to its (+) -enantiomer. The acceptance level for (−) praziquantel, however, was not signiﬁcantly lower than that of the paste containing β-cyclodextrin and a ﬂavor. Hence, an improvement of the results for (−) -praziquantel might be possible if <b>taste</b> <b>masking</b> agents were added. So in conclusion, <b>taste</b> <b>masking</b> of praziquantel was achieved in form of an aqueous paste containing β-cyclodextrin and a ﬂavor as <b>taste</b> <b>masking</b> agents: the resulting paste is willingly taken by cats and also rated easily applicable by pet owners. ...|$|E

The results demonstrated successful <b>taste</b> <b>masking.</b> Water was used to study the in vitro dissolution performance of the three formulations of commercial tablet, capsule and self-made suspension. The self-made suspension showed a lower and slower release, the insoluble carrier octadecanol blocked the drug dissolving from the solid dispersion. It was indicated from the primary stability study, the self-made suspensions were sensitive to high temperature, high humidity and strong light conditions, they should be stored in sealed containers away from heat, light and humidity...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work the {{attempt was made}} to prepare <b>taste</b> <b>masked</b> {{suspension}} of Ambroxol Hydrochloride by abating the intensely bitter taste of Ambroxol Hydrochloride. Taste abatement was done by complexing of Ambroxol hydrochloride with different Ion Exchange Resins (IER) like Tulsion 335 and Indion 214 in different ratios. The prepared suspensions were evaluated for taste, drug content, particle size, viscosity, sedimentation volume and drug release. The resonates prepared with drug- T 335 ratio (1 : 2) at pH 8, gave maximum drug loading. Suspension containing above resinates showed more than 80 % In vitro drug release within 30 min. Prepared formulation also showed good stability and can retain its palatable taste. The developed formulation was an additional advantage like simplification of manufacturing procedure and is economical. Thus, the “patientfriendly dosage form ” of bitter drugs, especially for pediatric, geriatric, bedridden, and noncooperative patients, can be successfully formulated using this technology...|$|R
40|$|Lornoxicam is a non steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug with analgesic properties. The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a <b>taste</b> <b>masked</b> oral disintegrating tablet of poorly soluble Lornoxicam by direct compression technique with β-cyclodextrin (BCD) complexes using various super disintegrants like sodium starch glycolate, crospovidone and croscarmellose sodium. Prepared tablets were evaluated for different properties like drug content, hardness, friability, disintegration time and in vitro dissolution study. The different formulations showed disintegration time between 22 to 58 s. Drug release showed time between the ranges of 8 to 20 min. Among all the formulations, L 6 showed 99. 85 % drug release within 8 min. Thus, L 6 was considered best among the other formulations. The stability study was conducted as per the ICH guidelines and the formulations were found to be stable, with insignificant change in hardness, drug content and disintegration time. The tablets showed enhanced dissolution hence better patient compliance...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we {{investigated}} the solubility enhancement of 3 water insoluble drugs by using cyclodextrins in two pharmaceutical delivery forms: Solutions and Suspensions. A preliminary conclusion was {{that through the}} use of cyclodextrins it was possible to increase the solubility of the 3 water insoluble drugs, Cyclosporin A, Azithromycin and Budesonide. In addition,all the formulations were stable and suitable to be nebulised using the intended eflow device. It was also an objective of this work the elaboration of a systematic pathway for the development of formulations suitable for nebulisation. Based on the knowledge collect during this work, a database system was built as an aid tool for the pharmaceutical formulation development process. In conclusion, it was able to increase the solubility/stability and also to <b>taste</b> <b>mask</b> formulations containing both water insoluble and water soluble drugs. This opens new possibilities to the pulmonary delivery as an alternative non-invasive method of delivering drugs that currently can only be delivered orally or intravenously...|$|R
