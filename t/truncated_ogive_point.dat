50|$|The {{feed ramp}} is a {{critical}} part of a semi-automatic pistol or automatic rifle. When the pistol is fired and the spent case is ejected, the feed ramp functions to direct a fresh cartridge from the magazine into firing position; that is, the slides along the feed ramp into battery. The need for the cartridge to slide both forwards and upwards along the feed ramp and into the barrel is the primary design consideration that makes the ogive the preferred shape for all modern automatic pistol rounds (a hollow point bullet is a <b>truncated</b> <b>ogive),</b> as there are many other shapes that are stable in ballistic flight.|$|R
2500|$|The arms of Léopold-Henri Amyot [...] show [...] "per fess ogivy"; this {{is based}} on the <b>ogive</b> or <b>pointed</b> arch.|$|R
50|$|The interior's single nave is surmounted by cross vaults, {{supported}} by Gothic buttresses. The side walls feature a triforium with pointed-arch stained glass windows. The apse {{is separated from}} the nave by a wall reaching to the vaulted ceiling and perforated with openings, namely one enormous <b>ogive</b> or <b>pointed</b> arch in the center framing the high altar, flanked by two smaller pointed arches as entrances to the ambulatory at the apse. The {{upper reaches of the}} wall bear a large central rose window (1705, dedicated to the Archangel St. Michael) flanked by two smaller ones. The polygonal apse is in turn flanked by two short galleries, with <b>ogive</b> or <b>pointed</b> arches as entrances, which correspond to the original aisles of the Romanesque building and are located at the starting point of the ambulatory. The latter is divided by piers aligned with the rays of the apse's trapezoidal vaults, forming ten radial chapels.|$|R
50|$|In 1947, studies into {{wave drag}} {{led to the}} {{development}} of perfect shapes to reduce wave drag as much as theoretically possible. For a fuselage the resulting shape was the Sears-Haack body, which suggested a perfect cross-sectional shape for any given internal volume. The von Kármán ogive was a similar shape for bodies with a blunt end, like a missile. Both were based on long narrow shapes with pointed ends, the main difference being that the <b>ogive</b> was <b>pointed</b> on only one end.|$|R
50|$|In {{ballistics}} or aerodynamics, an <b>ogive</b> is a <b>pointed,</b> {{curved surface}} mainly used {{to form the}} approximately streamlined nose of a bullet or other projectile. In this manner, much air resistance or the drag of air can be overcome and these projectiles can move much faster {{as a result of}} these ogives a projectile has.|$|R
5000|$|Dr. Francesco Narducci's {{body was}} {{recovered}} from Lake Trasimeno near Perugia, Umbria, in 1985 and was initially {{determined to be}} a drowning. [...] His body was discovered {{a month after the}} final double-murder linked to the Monster of Florence. The name of Dr. Narducci belonged to a list of [...] "persons of interest" [...] issued by the Florence Police in relation to the Monster of Florence cases since 1987. Police and prosecutors in Florence initially investigated Narducci's death as connected to the murders after a number of anonymous letters were received, but police were unable to find evidence of a connection. According to journalist P. Licciardi, police departments carried on [...] "parallel" [...] and irregular investigations on Narducci since September 10. 1985 in Florence, while a Carabinieri high officer in Perugia ordered the search of Narducci's apartment, without informing superior authorities. The same day, a male nurse at a Florence hospital found a bullet, identical to the ones used in the murders, lying {{on the floor in the}} hospital parking before a garage entrance, with its <b>ogive</b> <b>pointing</b> in direction of the hospital's entrance. The police searched the hospital, including doctors' wardrobes. [...] A speculation that a doctor might be involved in the murders already circulated among investigators, since experts ponted out that some of the excissions of body parts from the female victims' bodies apparently had almost a surgical quality (a pathologist testifying about one body said it looked as if the perpetrator [...] "could perform mastectomies").|$|R
40|$|The use {{of steel}} armour plate targets for {{competitive}} sports shooting {{has been increasing}} in popularity over the last forty years. Steel armour used in battle may only be used for short periods and receive impacts only in the hundreds, from specific threats that occur in battle {{and the majority of}} past research is based around this. In contrast steel targets used in competition are subject to thousands of impacts over their life span, for a variety of commercially available projectiles. Hence the approach to their designs is more interested in the limit that causes no damage, rather than the limit which prevents total penetration. This study deals with the impacts of commercially available target and hunting style projectiles impacting against 12 mm Bisalloy 500, which is a common choice for targets in Australia. Five different projectiles were selected with the following matching characteristics; different diameter and similar mass, different diameter and similar length, same diameter and different length and same diameter with different nose shapes. The projectiles were fired into test plates at 25 m using matching and stepped velocities and their penetration depths recorded. Data was compiled in MATLAB and compared with the Allen Rogers penetration model and the Alekseevskii Tate penetration model. Trends were identified with the long <b>ogive</b> hollow <b>point</b> projectiles when normalized, showing that there is a distinct pattern which cannot be predicated using the AR or AT model using the standard inputs. The AT model was able to be matched up with the penetration for the short and solid construction projectiles, giving a reasonable estimate for the penetration depth up to impacts around 950 m/s, where plates are very close to failure. It has been shown that there is a substantial difference in the penetration based on the construction of the projectile and short blunt projectiles have a far lower velocity threshold to prevent damage. From this research the following maximum impact velocities have been recommended that will cause minimal (> 0. 5 mm) damage to 12 mm Bisalloy 500. For long <b>ogive</b> hollow <b>point</b> projectiles a maximum impact velocity of 900 m/s and for solid short and blunt projectiles a maximum impact velocity of 750 m/s. ...|$|R
5000|$|In Gothic architecture, ogives are the {{intersecting}} transverse ribs of arches which {{establish the}} surface of a Gothic vault. An ogive or ogival arch is a pointed, [...] "Gothic" [...] arch, drawn with compasses as outlined above, or with arcs of an ellipse as described. A very narrow, steeply <b>pointed</b> <b>ogive</b> arch is sometimes called a [...] "lancet arch". The most common form is an equilateral arch, where the radius {{is the same as the}} width. In the later Flamboyant Gothic style, an [...] "ogee arch", an arch with a pointed head, like S-shaped curves, became prevalent.|$|R
5000|$|Other Paris churches soon {{adapted the}} Gothic style; the choir of Abbey church of Saint-Germain-des-Prés was {{completely}} rebuilt {{in the new}} style, with pointed arches and flying buttresses. The church of Saint-Pierre de Montmartre was rebuilt with <b>ogives,</b> or gothic <b>pointed</b> arches. The church of Saint-Germain-l'Auxerois, next to the Louvre, was given a portal inspired by Notre Dame, and the church of Saint-Severin was given a Gothic nave with the first triforium, or first-story side gallery, in Paris. The supreme example of the new style was the upper chapel of Sainte-Chapelle, where the walls seemed to be made entirely of stained glass.|$|R
5000|$|The two bombs {{reportedly}} {{used the}} same basic fissile weapon design, but the Mark 11 had a much more modern external casing designed to penetrate further and more reliably into the ground. The Mark 8 had a flat nose, much like a torpedo. The Mark 11 nose was a <b>pointed</b> <b>ogive</b> shape.The MK-11 {{also known as the}} MK-91 had variable yields by changing the target rings. A major difference over the MK-8 was that the MK-91 had an electric operated actuator as a safety device that would rotate a spline ring to prevent the projectile from being fired into the target rings. The MK-8 had no safety devices. Upon release from the delivery aircraft detonation would occur after the black powder fuzes burned 90-110 seconds. The MK-91 was a deep penetrating weapon in many surface materials. A [...] "PHOEBE" [...] polonium initiator increased the nuclear detonation efficiency.|$|R
50|$|The {{degree to}} which {{permanent}} and temporary cavitation occur {{is dependent on the}} mass, diameter, material, design and velocity of the bullet. This is because bullets crush tissue, and do not cut it. A bullet constructed with a half diameter ogive designed meplat and hard, solid copper alloy material may crush only the tissue {{directly in front of the}} bullet. This type of bullet (monolithic-solid rifle bullet) is conducive to causing more temporary cavitation as the tissue flows around the bullet, resulting in a deep and narrow wound channel. A bullet constructed with a two diameter, hollow <b>point</b> <b>ogive</b> designed meplat and low-antimony lead-alloy core with a thin gilding metal jacket material will crush tissue in front and to the sides as the bullet expands. Due to the energy expended in bullet expansion, velocity is lost more quickly. This type of bullet (hollow-point hand gun bullet) is conducive to causing more permanent cavitation as the tissue is crushed and accelerated into other tissues by the bullet, causing a shorter and wider wound channel. The exception to this general rule is non-expanding bullets which are long relative to their diameter. These tend to destabilize and yaw (tumble) soon after impact, increasing both temporary and permanent cavitation.|$|R
