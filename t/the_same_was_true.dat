5|$|One of the {{original}} deployment plans for Zeus had been a defensive system for SAC. The Air Force argued against such a system, in favor of building more ICBMs of their own. Their logic was that every Soviet missile launched in a counterforce strike could destroy a single US missile. If both forces had similar numbers of missiles, such an attack would leave both forces with few remaining missiles to launch a counterstrike. Adding Zeus would {{reduce the number of}} losses on the US side, helping ensure a counterstrike force would survive. However, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> if the US built more ICBMs instead. The Air Force was far more interested in building its own missiles than the Army's, {{especially in the case of}} Zeus, which appeared to be easily outwitted.|$|E
5|$|The {{first episode}} of HolbyBlue was watched by an {{audience}} of 5.46 million viewers on BBC One, making it the fifteenth most-watched programme on the channel for the week of its broadcast. The second episode saw a fall in the ratings by 300,000 viewers, to 5.16 million viewers, making it the seventeenth most-watched programme on the channel for the week of its broadcast. The episode received a 26% audience share for its timeslot. The following episode dropped to 4.42 million viewers and twenty-fifth in the weekly rankings. Despite a 23% decrease in audience share, it continued to lead in its timeslot. By episode five, viewership had declined to 4.10 million and a 21% audience share, but the show remained the most-watched at 8pm. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> of episode six, watched by 4 million viewers with a 20% audience share. Viewership for episodes four to six fell below the channel's top thirty in the weekly rankings. The final two episodes of series one experienced an increase in viewership, to 4.13 and 4.36 million respectively, ranking HolbyBlue twenty-sixth then twenty-fourth in the channel ratings for the weeks of broadcast.|$|E

5|$|With filming complete, MJZ {{contacted}} post-production company Asylum {{to begin}} work on the substantial visual effects component of The Life. The team, led by Visual Effects Supervisor Robert Moggach, tripled in size as {{the scale of the}} work required became apparent, given the deadline of three weeks. Work on the opening funeral scene was relatively easy, requiring the creation of only minor elements such as additional tombstones in the foreground and color correction on the actors. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> for the training sequence, where only minimal tracking work and compositing of matte backgrounds was required. The bulk of the visual effects work was in the battle sequence. This ranged from simple work such as wire removal to the creation of dynamic lighting and reflections from visors and armor, to particle effects for the background smoke and dust, plasma weapon fire and alterations to some of the filmed explosions to lend them the appearance given to plasma explosions within the Halo games. The entire background was a 3D projection of matte paintings and dramatic skies. While the Brute was partially animatronic, substantial adjustments such as scaling to almost twice the size and the enhancement of fine muscle movements of the creature were made. Other elements, such as the Banshee aircraft and the drop-pods, were created entirely through the use of CGI. Software used by Asylum FX included Flame and Nuke for compositing, Maya for animation, RenderMan and Mantra for rendering, SynthEyes for tracking, Silhouette Pro for rotoscoping work.|$|E
25|$|Smoking {{in public}} was, {{for a long}} time, {{reserved}} for men, and when done by women was sometimes associated with promiscuity; in Japan, during the Edo period, prostitutes and their clients often approached one another {{under the guise of}} offering a smoke. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> in 19th-century Europe.|$|E

Growth fell to about −0.6% in 1998 from 5.2% in 1997, but recovered to 3.4% by 1999. It also resulted to the shutdown of some businesses, a decline in importation, a rising unemployment rate and an unstable financial sector.|$|E
25|$|Russell {{claimed that}} he was more {{convinced}} of his method of doing philosophy than of his philosophical conclusions. Science was one of the principal components of analysis. Russell was a believer in the scientific method, that science reaches only tentative answers, that scientific progress is piecemeal, and attempts to find organic unities were largely futile. He believed <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> of philosophy. Russell held that the ultimate objective of both science and philosophy was to understand reality, not simply to make predictions.|$|E
25|$|Artificial landscapes often mimicked sacred landscapes. Doorways of temples {{were seen}} as the cave entrances to mountains. Sometimes these doorways were witz monster mouths. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> for the Aztecs, who at Utatlán {{designed}} an artificial cave that ends under the central plaza and is designed according to the mythical seven-chamber cave of emergence, Chicomoztoc (this is also seen at Teotihuacan, though somewhat different). and at Muklebal Tzul it appears that an artificial well underneath a massive platform was made to appear like a water-bearing cave. In the Yucatán many Late Postclassic temples had Spanish churches built {{on top of them}} after the conquest and so caves and cenotes can still be found near these places today.|$|E

By mid-1929, Hollywood was producing almost exclusively sound films; by the end of the following year, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> in much of Western Europe.

25|$|In ancient Egyptian art, female {{pubic hair}} is {{indicated}} {{in the form of}} painted triangles. In medieval and classical European art, pubic hair was very rarely depicted, and male pubic hair was often, but not always, omitted. Sometimes it was portrayed in stylized form, {{as was the case with}} Greek graphic art. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> in much of Indian art, and in other Eastern portrayals of the nude. In 16th century southern Europe, Michelangelo showed the male David with stylized pubic hair, but female bodies were depicted hairless below the head. Nevertheless, Michelangelo's male nudes on the Sistine Chapel ceiling display no pubic hair. In Renaissance northern Europe, pubic hair was more likely to be portrayed than in the south, more usually male, while occasionally on female figures.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of medicine in the early Middle Ages was in fact empirical and pragmatic. It focused mainly on curing disease rather than discovering the cause of diseases. Often it was believed the cause of disease was supernatural. Nevertheless, approaches to curing disease existed. People in the Middle Ages considered medicine through {{an understanding of the}} humors. This approach was likely influenced by a largely rural existence in which people understood the influences of the elements of the sustenance of agriculture. Since {{it was clear that the}} fertility of the earth depended on the proper balance of the elements, it followed that <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> for the body, within which the various humors, as they were understood, had to be in balance. This approach greatly influenced medical theory throughout the Middle Ages.|$|E

25|$|To be sure, {{the ethnic}} {{definitions}} were loose categorisations. Overarching politico-ethnic identities {{were still in}} their early stages of development. In the western mainland, even the so-called major ethnic groups—such as Burmans, Mons, Shans—were themselves divided into rival centres, with distinctive local traditions {{and in many cases}} different dialects. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> for smaller minorities still—indeed, terms like Kachins, Karens, and Chins are exonyms given by Burmans that summarily group several different groups. In the central mainland, the main Siamese, Lao and Yuan ethnicities were still in an embryonic stage, and a chiefly elite concept. In Siam, the Siamese language and ethnicity were the “preserve” of the aristocracy called the munnai, and most commoners in Ayutthaya, according to an early 16th-century Portuguese observer, still spoke Mon dialects rather than still emerging Siamese, and cut their hair like the Mons of Pegu.|$|E
25|$|A {{survey by}} the {{government}} of the damage done found that few buildings from one to five stories suffered serious damage; <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> for buildings over fifteen stories. When the buildings were built seemed to have an effect as well. Before the 1957 earthquake, there were no building codes with respect to earthquake resistance. Some regulations were passed in that year and more in 1976 after another, stronger earthquake shook the city. However, none of these regulations had an event like 1985's in mind when passed. Most of the seriously damaged buildings were built between 1957 and 1976, when the city was starting to build upwards, in the six-to-fifteen floor range. In second place were buildings from before 1957, possibly because they were weakened by the earlier earthquakes. Structures built between 1976 and 1985 suffered the least damage.|$|E
25|$|The {{level of}} {{education}} one has attained has played a large part in Mexican feminism. Schoolteachers, in most cultures, {{are some of the}} first women to enter the work force and <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> in Mexico. Many of the early feminists who emerged from the Revolution were teachers either before or after the war, as were the participants of the Primer Congreso Feminista, the first feminist congress in Mexico. The participants in the Mexico 68 clashes who went on to form that generation's feminist movement were predominantly students and educators. The advisers who established themselves within the unions after the 1985 earthquakes were educated women who understood the legal and political aspects of organized labor. What they realized was that to form a sustained movement and attract working class women, they needed to utilize worker's expertise and knowledge of their jobs to meld a practical, working system.|$|E
