5|$|There is no {{consensus}} about how effectively the edict was enforced. Supposedly, inflation, speculation, and monetary instability continued, and a black market arose to <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> <b>goods</b> forced out of official markets. The edict's penalties were applied unevenly across the empire (some scholars believe they were applied only in Diocletian's domains), widely resisted, and eventually dropped, perhaps {{within a year of}} the edict's issue. Lactantius has written of the perverse accompaniments to the edict; of goods withdrawn from the market, of brawls over minute variations in price, of the deaths that came when its provisions were enforced. His account may be true, but it seems to modern historians exaggerated and hyperbolic, and the impact of the law is recorded in no other ancient source.|$|E
5|$|The global {{financial}} crisis precipitated in 2007 and 2008 shared {{some of the}} key features exhibited by the wave of international financial crises in the 1990s, including accelerated capital influxes, weak regulatory frameworks, relaxed monetary policies, herd behavior during investment bubbles, collapsing asset prices, and massive deleveraging. The systemic problems originated in the United States and other advanced nations. Similarly to the 1997 Asian crisis, the global crisis entailed broad lending by banks undertaking unproductive real estate investments as well as poor standards of corporate governance within financial intermediaries. Particularly in the United States, the crisis was characterized by growing securitization of non-performing assets, large fiscal deficits, and excessive financing in the housing sector. While the real estate bubble in the U.S. triggered the financial crisis, the bubble was financed by foreign capital flowing from many different countries. As its contagious effects began infecting other nations, the crisis became a precursor for the global economic downturn now referred to as the Great Recession. In the wake of the crisis, total volume of world <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> <b>goods</b> and services fell 10% from 2008 to 2009 and did not recover until 2011, with an increased concentration in emerging market countries. The {{global financial}} crisis demonstrated the negative effects of worldwide financial integration, sparking discourse on how and whether some countries should decouple themselves from the system altogether.|$|E

25|$|As a {{first step}} towards the CSME, Haiti was due to enter the <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> <b>goods</b> regime of the Single Market in January 2010 (earlier targets had been for some time in 2009) but could not do so because of the earthquake. Up until that point much work had been done by CROH and its Haitian {{government}} counterpart, the Bureau de Coordination et de Suivi or BCS (Office of Coordination and Monitoring), on the technical work necessary to bring the Haitian national tariff {{in line with the}} Caricom Common External Tariff (CET). The next step that had to be taken for Haiti to commence full free <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> <b>goods</b> within the CSME was therefore for the Haitian Parliament to pass legislation adopting the Caricom External tariff as Haiti’s national tariff. In mid 2009, the Government of Haiti announced that it would be ready to participate fully in free <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> <b>goods</b> within the CSME by 1 January 2010; and in fact through a revised Custom Act adopted by the Haitian Parliament in late 2009, 20-30% of the Caricom CET was incorporated into the Haitian national tariff. However soon after Haiti's progress towards full adoption of the CET began to stall with the dismissal of the Government of Prime Minister Michèle Pierre-Louis in November 2009 and was then put on hold {{as a result of the}} January 2010 earthquake. To assist in stimulating economic activity, the Council for Trade and Economic Development (COTED) in December, approved a request for some Haitian products to be exported within the Single Market on a non-reciprocal preferential basis for three years. Consultations are on-going towards approval of additional items from an original list which Haiti submitted. The concession became effective from 1 January 2011. CARICOM Secretariat officials are continuing their training exercises with Haitian customs officials to facilitate their understanding of the CSME’s trading regime.|$|E
40|$|Intra-regional <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> {{intermediate}} <b>goods</b> {{has become}} an important feature of <b>trade</b> and production <b>in</b> East Asia. In this article, I consider the implication of this intra-regional <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> intermediate <b>goods</b> to the choice of exchange rate regime for East Asian countries. Towards this end, I build a three-country New Open Economy Macroeconomic model which incorporates intra-regional <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> intermediate <b>goods</b> along with <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> final <b>goods.</b> The simulation results show that, {{in the presence of}} intra-regional <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> intermediate <b>goods,</b> <b>in</b> addition to the linkage in consumption (or aggregate demand), there emerges a new and important linkage between East Asian countries: that in production. In general, the optimal choice of exchange rate regime depends on the price setting behavior of firms in domestic and foreign markets.

Next, it tries to find out if foreign direct investment plays a role in the import and export behavior of East Asian intra-regional trade. Using a gravity model, it evidences that in general FDI is important in explaining imports and exports of intra-East Asian <b>trade.</b> <b>In</b> particular, FDI is especially important <b>in</b> explaining <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> components and parts, followed by <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> capital <b>goods.</b> This helps confirm that FDI and trade associated with production fragmentation in East Asia are complementary. ...|$|R
