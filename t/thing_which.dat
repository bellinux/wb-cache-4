However, the couple {{mutually}} agrees to end their long-running relationship after realizing that Richard does not want children, while Monica aspires to eventually raise a family of her own one day. While in England attending Ross' second wedding, to Emily (Helen Baxendale), Monica sleeps with Chandler. Initially supposed to have been a casual, one-time <b>thing</b> <b>which</b> grew more recurrent, Monica and Chandler eventually develop feelings for each other, but attempt to conceal it from their friends for as long as possible. After finally revealing their relationship to their friends, who are delighted by the news, Monica proposes to Chandler, and they marry.|$|E

25|$|Armstrong rejects dispositionalism, {{the idea}} that dispositional {{properties}} (or powers as they are sometimes referred to) are ontologically significant and {{have an important role}} in explaining laws of nature. Armstrong believes that the challenge that dispositionalism presents for his account of laws of nature is not in the case of manifested dispositions (say, a glass dropping on the ground and breaking) but unmanifested dispositions (the fact that counter factually if one were to drop the glass on the ground, it would break). Armstrong simply states that the disposition is simply {{in the nature of the}} instantiated properties of the <b>thing</b> <b>which</b> is supposed to have the disposition.|$|E
25|$|In December 1967, Cetera arrived {{early for}} a show to watch a band called The Big Thing. Impressed by their use of a horn section {{combined}} with rock and roll, Cetera left The Exceptions to join The Big Thing within two weeks. The Big <b>Thing,</b> <b>which</b> soon changed their name to The Chicago Transit Authority (and eventually shortened it to Chicago) released their self-titled debut album The Chicago Transit Authority on Columbia Records in 1969. Cetera shared lead vocal on three of the eleven songs on the album, with his tenor voice complementing the baritone voices of the two other lead singers in the group, keyboardist Robert Lamm and guitarist Terry Kath.|$|E
25|$|At the February council meeting, great {{opposition}} {{was raised to}} the proposed construction of a line along Forest Road at an estimated cost of £13,000, and so the scheme was dropped. One good <b>thing</b> <b>which</b> {{came out of this}} meeting was the approval for top-covering two trams experimentally, at a cost of £85 each. Cars 33 and 94 made their appearance on 9 March with Bellamy-type roofs. This type of roof was the idea of C. R. Bellamy, the Manager of Liverpool Corporation Tramways, and consisted of a box-like structure over the main saloon, without covers over the canopies at each end. On the whole they were well received and increased receipts were taken on the cars, with the result that similar modifications to further cars, believed to be four in number, were made.|$|E

25|$|The rule in Rylands v. Fletcher {{will not}} cover cases of harm to persons within the {{premises}} where the inherently dangerous activity is carried out, {{for the rule}} requires escape of the <b>thing,</b> <b>which</b> causes harm from the premises. The new rule makes no distinction between the persons within the premises where the enterprise is operating or and persons outside the premises because escape of the thing causing harm from the premises is not {{a necessary condition for}} the applicability of the rule. Further, the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher, though strict {{in the sense that it}} is not dependent on any negligence on the part of the defendant and in this respect similar to the new rule, is not absolute as it is subject to many exceptions but the new rule in Mehta’s case is not only strict but absolute and is subject to no exception.|$|E
25|$|One of the Cypriot Third Division teams was Ethnikos Defteras, a team {{which had}} been {{promoted}} from the amateur divisions. However, they were expelled from Cyprus Football Association after Cyprus' Court of Arbitration for Sport decision, after Doxa Paliometochou's objection based on a federation's regulation in which teams of villages with population under 1500 people couldn't join the federation. Ethnikos Defteras resorted to the court. Before the court’s decision to be known, the draw of the preliminary round made, including Ethnikos Defteras. They were drawn against 1983-84 Cypriot Third Division team, Ethnikos Assia F.C.. During the draw, Cyprus Football Association announced that if the court's decision hadn't been known in {{two weeks after the}} draw (and the other teams would have already played their qualifying matches), the opponent of Ethnikos Defteras would advance to the next round without playing any match, <b>thing</b> <b>which</b> it happened.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{his career}} Wolf {{modelled}} his lieder after those of Franz Schubert and Robert Schumann, particularly in the period around his relationship with Vally Franck; in fact, they were good enough imitations to pass off as the real <b>thing,</b> <b>which</b> he once attempted, though his cover was blown too soon. It is speculated that his choice of lieder texts in the earlier years, largely dealing with sin and anguish, were partly influenced by his contraction of syphilis. His love for Vally, not fully requited, inspired highly chromatic and philosophical lieder that could be regarded as successors to Wagner's Wesendonck Lieder cycle. Others were as distant from those in mood as possible; lighthearted and humorous. The rarely heard symphonic poem Penthesilea is tempestuous and highly colored as well. Although Wolf admired Liszt, who had encouraged him to complete the work, he felt Liszt's own music too dry and academic and strove for color and passion.|$|E
