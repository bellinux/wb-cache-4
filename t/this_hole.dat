5|$|A {{circular}} {{hole was}} {{cut into the}} backdrop {{and covered with a}} transparent material. A strong light behind <b>this</b> <b>hole</b> represented the moon. The light was occasionally manipulated to suggest the passage of clouds. Gautier and St. Georges wanted the pool to be made of large mirrors but Pillet rejected this idea because of its cost. In the 1868 revival, however, mirrors were acquired for this scene.|$|E
5|$|A {{fusible plug}} is a {{threaded}} metal cylinder usually of bronze, brass or gunmetal, with a tapered hole drilled completely through its length. <b>This</b> <b>hole</b> is sealed {{with a metal}} {{of low melting point}} that flows away if a pre-determined, high temperature is reached. The initial use of the fusible plug was as a safety precaution against low water levels in steam engine boilers, but later applications extended its use to other closed vessels, such as air conditioning systems and tanks for transporting corrosive or liquefied petroleum gasses.|$|E
5|$|Ballard's {{survey found}} no {{underwater}} penetrations of the ship's fully armoured citadel. Eight holes {{were found in}} the hull, one on the starboard side and seven on the port side, all above the waterline. One of the holes is in the deck, on the bow's starboard side. The angle and shape indicates the shell that created the hole was fired from Bismarcks port side and struck the starboard anchor chain. The anchor chain has disappeared down <b>this</b> <b>hole.</b> Six holes are amidships, three shell fragments pierced the upper splinter belt, and one made a hole in the main armour belt. Further aft a huge hole is visible, parallel to the aircraft catapult, on the deck. The submersibles recorded no sign of a shell penetration through the main or side armour here, and {{it is likely that the}} shell penetrated the deck armour only. Huge dents showed that many of the 14inch shells fired by King George V bounced off the German belt armour.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} break out of Normandy, the Allied armies {{developed}} a multi-stage operation. It started with a British and Canadian attack along the eastern battle line around Caen in Operation Goodwood on 18 July. The German Army responded by sending a large portion of its armoured reserves to defend. Then, on 25 July thousands of American bombers carpet bombed a 6000-metre hole on the western end of the German lines around Saint-Lô in Operation Cobra, allowing the Americans to push forces through <b>this</b> <b>hole</b> in the German lines. After some initial resistance, the German forces were overwhelmed and the Americans broke through. On 1 August, Lieutenant General George S. Patton was named the commanding officer of the newly recommissioned US Third Army—which included large segments of the soldiers that had broken through the German lines—and with few German reserves behind the front line, the race was on. The Third Army quickly pushed south and then east, meeting very little German resistance. Concurrently, the British and Canadian troops pushed south (Operation Bluecoat) in an attempt to keep the German armour engaged. Under the weight of this British and Canadian attack, the Germans withdrew; the orderly withdrawal eventually collapsed due to lack of fuel.|$|E
5|$|The interclavicle is a {{large plate}} with a smooth upper surface and a {{prominent}} groove on the bottom surface. It also bears a small, pointed projection at its back end. The scapulae have prominent shelves on each side (diagnostic of leptocleidids and polycotylids, but not strongly differentiated in elasmosaurids), and their glenoids are clearly concave, with roughened attachments for cartilage. The two coracoids curve outwards {{in the middle and}} contact at their ends, forming a hole in the middle, although the exact morphology of <b>this</b> <b>hole</b> is uncertain. The regions where the coracoids contact is vaulted and thickened to form a weak, ridge-like projection, comparable to but probably convergently acquired from elasmosaurids. The pubes form a somewhat rectangular dish, with a convex front edge and concave outer edge, while the ischia are flat, triangular, and plate-like. The edges of the pubes where they meet the ischia curve inwards from the midline to each side. The corresponding edges of the ischia are similarly-shaped, with the curved edges of the bones collectively forming two rounded fenestrae that are connected in the center by a small rhombus-shaped opening, as also seen in Futabasaurus. The ilia are rod-shaped and bent, with blunt projections halfway along their outer rims; at the top end, they are flattened into a fan-like shape.|$|E

25|$|Kalân Mosque (Masjid-i Kalân), arguably {{completed}} in 1514, {{is equal to}} the Bibi-Khanym Mosque in Samarkand in size. The mosque is able to accommodate 12 thousand people.

25|$|Of {{this first}} edifice, the gables of the transept, a single portal, the tower {{up until the}} {{uppermost}} corbel table and some pillars are all that remain. As noted above, {{the eastern part of}} the church was rebuilt during the early 13th century. The transept was doubled in size, a new choir added to the east of it and in the angle between the choir and the transept, two towers constructed. During this construction period, a new southern portal, still Romanesque in style, was sculpted. After an interval of a few years, a new reconstruction scheme began. The nave was now enlarged to become as wide as the transept, in effect transforming the church from a basilica to a hall church. Again, the models can be traced to western Germany. The superfluous space between the ceiling and roof was turned into a very large attic. In the easternmost vault of the church, constituting the ceiling of the choir, a round hole exists. Scholars believe that <b>this</b> <b>hole</b> was used during enactments of the story of the Passion of Christ, to pull up a wooden statue of Christ in order to illustrate his very concrete ascent to heaven.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{energy content}} of the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole {{surrounded}} by quintessence is investigated using approximate Lie symmetry methods. It is mainly done by assuming mass and charge of the black hole as small quantities (), and by retaining its second power in the perturbed geodesic equations for such black hole while neglecting its higher powers. Due {{to the presence of}} trivial second-order approximate Lie symmetries of these perturbed geodesic equations, a rescaling of the geodetic parameter gives a rescaling of the energy in <b>this</b> black <b>hole.</b> Interestingly we obtain an explicit relation of the rescaling factor that depends on the square of the charge to mass ratio of the black hole, the normalization factor α, which is related to the state parameter of the quintessence matter, and the coordinate r. A comparison of this rescaling factor with that of the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole (Hussain et. al SIGMA, 2007), without quintessence is given. It is observed that the presence of the quintessence field reduces the energy in <b>this</b> black <b>hole</b> spacetime. Further it is found that there exists a point outside the event horizon of <b>this</b> black <b>hole</b> where the effect of quintessence balances the energy content in <b>this</b> black <b>hole</b> without quintessence, and where the total energy of the underlying spacetime becomes zero...|$|R
