5|$|James Device {{pleaded not}} guilty to the murders by {{witchcraft}} of Anne Townley and John Duckworth. However he, like Chattox, had earlier made a confession to Nowell, which was read out in court. That, and the evidence presented against him by his sister Jennet, who said <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> her brother asking a black dog he had conjured up to help him kill Townley, was sufficient to persuade the jury to find him guilty.|$|E
5|$|Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal {{searched for}} Wallenberg and {{collected}} several testimonies. For example, British businessman Greville Wynne, who was imprisoned in the Lubyanka prison in 1962 for his connection to KGB defector Oleg Penkovsky, {{stated that he}} had talked to, but {{could not see the}} face of, a man who claimed to be a Swedish diplomat. Efim (or Yefim) Moshinsky claims to have seen Wallenberg on Wrangel Island in 1962. An eyewitness asserted <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> Wallenberg in the 1960s in a Soviet prison.|$|E

5|$|Other {{witnesses}} for {{the plaintiffs}} included a former maid of Brownlee's, who testified <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> the premier pick MacMillan up in his car late one night, and MacMillan's landlady's daughter, who testified that she found MacMillan sobbing in her room one night. Allan MacMillan was also called: though he testified that Brownlee had encouraged his daughter to move to Edmonton and promised to forward information about Alberta College, he acknowledged that the premier had not followed through and not contacted her again until she was in Edmonton.|$|E
5|$|In July 1822, Edward Williams and Percy Shelley drowned {{when their}} boat sank during a storm while {{returning}} to Lerici from Pisa. Shortly before their deaths, Jane dreamed of floods {{and on one}} occasion thought <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> Shelley's ghost through a window. After hearing of their deaths, Jane and Mary travelled back to Pisa for the funerals of their husbands; Williams and Shelley were cremated on consecutive days in August 1822. After Shelley's cremation, Jane was forced to settle a dispute between Mary Shelley and Leigh Hunt {{over what to do}} with what they believed was the unburnt heart of Percy Shelley. Though Hunt had initially taken it from Shelley's pyre, Mary insisted that he return it to her. Though Hunt was initially unwilling to do so, Jane later convinced him that it should be returned. Mary Shelley and Jane Williams briefly settled in Albaro, before proceeding to Genoa together. There they separated in September due to Jane's desire to quickly return to England. Jane brought Edward's ashes with her back to England.|$|E
5|$|Joan Young, who was {{the only}} {{first-hand}} witness, is challenged in both articles. She came forward in 2004, claiming <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> someone push something {{over the side of}} a boat on Coniston Water. This testimony is challenged, because so much time has passed and the fact that her husband saw nothing. However, he claims to have been reading his paper at the time. Also, {{it has been said that}} Young was too far away to identify the person in the boat, and that it couldn't have been Carol Park's body that was being dumped, as the Youngs were positioned so that the location Carol's body was found would have been visibly blocked by an island. The article even points out that Young described a boat that appeared to be a cruiser yacht. Despite the fact that Gordon did own a large yacht in 1997, in 1976 he owned only a 505 racing dinghy, which he sold later that year.|$|E

They {{returned}} to Australia a few years later, and Lana began attending Wattle Heights High School, where she was bullied over her sexuality. This led her to transfer to Erinsborough High. Lana finds employment at the Coffee Shop alongside Serena Bishop, whom she befriends. Lana is convinced <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> Serena before, and she realises that Serena had been in some photos taken by dodgy photographer Chris Cousens. Lana admits to Serena that she had also been taken in by Chris {{and that she was}} not over it. Lana did not get on with Serena's cousin, Sky, and one day they fight at school.

Lockhart had informed the Texians <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> 15 other prisoners at the Comanches' principal camp several days before. She maintained that the Indians had wanted to see how high a price they could get for her, and that they then planned to bring in the remaining captives one at a time.|$|E

When they enter the study, Mr. Carlile has the papers out but Lord Charles quickly sees that the plans of the fighter itself are gone. Carlile is adamant that they were in the safe and he put them on the table.
