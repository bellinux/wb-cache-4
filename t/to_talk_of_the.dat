25|$|Munyaradzi Gwisai, {{a former}} {{opposition}} member of parliament, organised {{a meeting to}} discuss the uprisings in North Africa on 21 February. He, along with 45 others, were arrested and allegedly tortured and face a charge of treason that carries the death penalty. Many Zimbwabwean migrants to South Africa, who number {{in the hundreds of}} thousands, are free <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> events. However, past violence in elections and many of the youth and educated middle classes having fled the country there were questions about the pool of protesters to carry out such actions.|$|E
25|$|Above we {{have used}} the {{standard}} mathematical formula for the sum of a geometric series. (Or if ireal =0 then the series in braces sums to p since it then has p equal terms). As an example, assume that S=60,000 per year {{and that it is}} desired to replace Rrepl=0.80, or 80%, of pre-retirement living standard for p=30 years. Assume for current purposes that a proportion z prop=0.25 (25%) of pay was being saved. Using ireal=0.02, or 2% per year real return on investments, the necessary lump sum is given by the formula as (1-0.25)*0.80*60,000*annuity-series-sum(30)=36,000*22.396=806,272 in the nation's currency in 2008–2010 terms. To allow for inflation in a straightforward way, it is best <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 806,272 as being '13.43 years of retirement age salary'. It may be appropriate to regard this as being the necessary lump sum to fund 36,000 of annual supplements to any employer or government pensions that are available. It is common to not include any house value in the calculation of this necessary lump sum, so for a homeowner the lump sum pays primarily for non-housing living costs.|$|E
500|$|Interest in the wordless novel revived {{with the}} rise of the graphic novel. [...] Comics fans {{discussed}} the works of Masereel and others in fanzines, and the discussions turned <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great American Novel being made in comics. [...] These discussions inspired cartoonist Art Spiegelman (b.1948), who in 1973 made a four-page strip, [...] "Prisoner on the Hell Planet", in an Expressionist style inspired by Ward's work. [...] Spiegelman later incorporated the strip into his graphic novel Maus (1992).|$|E

500|$|In 1942, {{the year}} before she died, Potter's {{thoughts}} returned to Kitty MacDonald when she wrote about a piece of crockery:Seventy eighty years ago it belonged to another old woman, old Katie MacDonald, the Highland washerwoman. She was a tiny body, brown as a berry, beady black eyes and much wrinkled, against an incongruously white frilled mutch. She wore a small plaid crossed over shawl pinned with a silver brooch, a bed jacket, and a full kilted petticoat. She dropped bob curtsies, but she was outspoken and very independent, proud and proper ... The joy of converse with old Katie was to draw her out <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> days {{when she was a}} wee bit lassie—herding the kine. The days when 'Boney' was a terror ... the old woman wouldn't dwell upon hard weather and storms; she spoke of the sunshine and clouds, and shadows, the heather bells, the ... "the broom of the Cowden Knowes", the sun and wind on the hills where she played, and knitted, and herded cattle and sheep. A bonny life it was, but it never came back ..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Group {{tensions}} within The Church proper {{were still}} simmering, however. More than anyone else, {{it was new}} drummer Tim Powles who tried to alleviate the outstanding disagreements. While Koppes and Willson-Piper had already had differences for some time, Kilbey and Willson-Piper's relationship was also strained by recent problems. Kilbey declared that the end was nigh: after a final, worthy swan song, with the working title Au Revoir Por Favor, the Church would be put to rest. The four agreed to play a string of farewell concerts around Australia, {{which turned out to}} be extremely successful. The roaring success of the intended [...] "final concert" [...] in Sydney put a quick end <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band's demise.|$|E

2500|$|The British {{army had}} been sent into Spain to aid in {{expelling}} the French, but they had been forced into a humiliating retreat in terrible winter conditions that wrought havoc with health and morale and resulted in the army degenerating into a rabble. [...] In his authoritative account of the battle, the English historian Christopher Hibbert states: [...] "It was all very well <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> courage and endurance of the troops but of what use were these virtues alone when pitted against the genius of Napoleon? [...] 35,000 men had crossed the Spanish frontier against him; 8000 had not returned. [...] We were unworthy of our great past". [...] The British of the day similarly viewed Corunna as a defeat: according to The Times, [...] "The fact must not be disguised ... that we have suffered a shameful disaster".|$|E
2500|$|Movement towards {{peace in}} Niger, which seemed {{unlikely}} {{at the beginning}} of 2009, progressed rapidly following the Malian peace deal. The taking of hostages by the AQIM in Niger, especially Canadian diplomat Robert Fowler, brought intense international interest in the security situation in Niger. Beginning in February 2009, there was intensive involvement with the Nigerien government and the rebel groups by the UN, Canada, and later by Algeria and Mali, and finally Libya. Canadian and other sources floated rumors of Tuareg rebel and even Nigerien government involvement in the kidnappings, which all sides united to deny. Malian and Algerian government mediators, as well as informal groups representing Tuareg interests and the Nigerien government met at a Malian organised conference in Niamey on 25 and 26 February. [...] Press in Bamako and Niamey began <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Malian Approach" [...] to peace.|$|E
2500|$|The {{interest}} of apparitional experiences to psychology has acquired an added dimension {{in recent years}} {{with the development of}} the concept of schizotypy or psychosis-proneness. This is conceived of as a dimension of personality, continuously distributed throughout the normal population, and analogous to the dimensions of extraversion or neuroticism. [...] As long as mental illness is regarded under the disease model, according to which a person either does or does not ‘have’ schizophrenia or manic depression, just as a person either does or does not have syphilis or tuberculosis, then <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> occurrence of an apparitional or hallucinatory experience in a normal person is either an oxymoron, or to be taken as an indication of latent or incipient psychosis. [...] If, on the contrary, a dimensional view of the matter is taken, it becomes easier to conceive of how normal people, more or less high on the putative schizotypy dimension, might be more or less prone to anomalous perceptual experiences, without their ever tipping over into psychosis.|$|E
60|$|There was {{no reason}} why she should give an {{innocent}} remark such a warm reception; but then, as the reader will no doubt have observed, the reluctance that some young women show <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> their marriage to the man they happen to have set their hearts on, is only equalled by the alacrity with which they marry him when the time comes.|$|R

He is scheduled to spend August 17 to the 20th in that state attending picnics and spaghetti dinners, and meeting with local pastors. When Huckabee appeared on Fox News' Hannity and Colmes to discuss his straw poll showing and future plans, he expressed confidence in his New Hampshire effort and said that [...] "we have a great team in New Hampshire. I'm very confident we're going to surprise people in New Hampshire just like we did Iowa. Also in the week following the Straw Poll, Huckabee continued <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> momentum his campaign gained from his 2nd place showing. He told reporters that [...] "it was {{a great day for}} us and the results have been pretty dramatic. We had over 1,000 first-time contributors from Saturday night to Tuesday morning online and the phones have not stopped ringing." [...] In all, Huckabee experienced more media exposure in one week than he had in the past 6 months. He appeared on such shows as Hardball with Chris Matthews," [...] "Kudlow & Company," [...] "Hannity & Colmes," [...] The Early Show," [...] "Your World with Neil Cavuto" [...] and the Laura Ingraham radio show.|$|E
