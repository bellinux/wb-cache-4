25|$|Tuten's first novel, The Adventures of Mao on the Long March (1971), a fictionalized {{account of}} Chairman Mao's rise to power, is highly {{experimental}} in nature.

The story {{first appeared in}} 1969 in a 39-page condensed form in the magazine Artist Slain. The novel in its entirety was subsequently published by Citadel Press in 1971, and re-released in 2005 by New Directions.|$|E

Although inexpensive card readers {{are available}} <b>that</b> <b>read</b> many common formats, this results in two pieces of portable equipment (card plus reader) rather than one.|$|E

25|$|On September 14, 1989, seven ACT UP members {{infiltrated}} the New York Stock Exchange and chained {{themselves to}} the VIP balcony to protest {{the high price of}} the only approved AIDS drug, AZT.

Several days following this demonstration, Burroughs Wellcome lowered the price of AZT to $6,400 per patient per year.|$|E
25|$|Miguel Nicolelis {{and colleagues}} {{demonstrated}} that the activity of large neural ensembles can predict arm position. This work made possible creation of BCIs <b>that</b> <b>read</b> arm movement intentions and translate them into movements of artificial actuators. Carmena and colleagues programmed the neural coding in a BCI that allowed a monkey to control reaching and grasping movements by a robotic arm. Lebedev and colleagues argued that brain networks reorganize {{to create a new}} representation of the robotic appendage in addition to the representation of the animal's own limbs.|$|E
25|$|After hearing oral {{arguments}} in the case, the Supreme Court was conflicted as to the outcome.

Sensing that some members of the Court might be persuaded to change their votes, Stevens wrote a dissent <b>that</b> <b>read</b> like a majority opinion, and could be changed to one with the substitution of a few words.|$|E
