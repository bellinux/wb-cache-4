50|$|Geoff Dodkin and L.Stevens {{were two}} {{well-known}} specialist motorcycle retailers in the London area offering mechanical upgrades and cycle customising parts backed {{by their own}} race experiences.

50|$|Yamaha {{introduced}} the TZR125 in 1987 and production ended in 1992. It is {{identified by the}} single square headlight {{at the front of}} the box fairing, clip-ons located on <b>top</b> of the <b>yoke,</b> single seat and conventional forks.|$|R
5000|$|Thruxton handlebars, {{a type of}} {{motorcycle}} handlebar that {{is shaped}} to provide a clip-on-type handlebar position, but which clamps on <b>top</b> of the <b>yoke</b> rather than onto the fork stanchions. Thruxton handlebars are also known as [...] "Ace 'bars" [...] or [...] "Clubman 'bars".|$|R

Yoked and frilled to neck and hem. Ties to secure at front [...] Date: 1970 - 1975 - from the The Betty Smithers Design Collection at Staffordshire University. ...|$|R
50|$|Being {{the classic}} {{breastplate}} for English riding, campdrafting or stockwork, the stockman's or hunting breastplate {{is the most}} common type. It consists of a yoke (with a neck and wither strap), a breast strap {{at the bottom of the}} yoke which runs through the horse's front legs and attaches to the girth, and two straps at the <b>top</b> of the <b>yoke</b> which attach to the D-rings of a saddle. There are usually buckles for adjusting the size of the yoke as well as the length of the straps which attach to the saddle and girth. The hunting breastplate not only helps to prevent the saddle from slipping, but also may be used to attach a Market Harborough or standing and running martingales, which are clipped or buckled onto a ring at the chest.|$|R
5000|$|Longships for {{the most}} part used two {{different}} kinds of anchors. The most common was a natural wood yoke formed from a tree branch. The weight was supplied by a stone passing laterally through the U of the <b>yoke.</b> The <b>top</b> of the <b>yoke</b> was closed by either a length of hardwood or a curved iron head, which kept the stone in place. One side of the head stuck out so it could dig into mud or sand. In the Ladby ship burial in Denmark, a unique iron anchor has been found, resembling the modern fisherman's anchor but without the crossbar. The cross bar may have rusted away. This anchor [...] - [...] made of Norwegian iron [...] - [...] has a long iron chain to which the hemp warp was attached. This construction has several advantages when anchored in deep waters or in rough seas.|$|R
40|$|Permanent magnets with yokes {{are widely}} used in the watt and joule {{balances}} to measure the Planck constant for the forthcoming redefinition of the unit of mass, the kilogram. Recently, a permanent magnet system has been in consideration for a further practice of NIM- 2, the generalized joule balance. In this paper, an analytical model to design the permanent magnet system is presented. The presented model can be solved to obtain the preliminary parameters and then is used as guidance for FEA software to optimize the parameters of such magnetic system. As an instance {{for the application of}} the designing model, the design of the permanent magnet system for NIM- 2 is described and the special design of opening shape makes the misalignment of the <b>top</b> and middle <b>yokes</b> has little influence on the vertical component of the magnetic field.

5000|$|Bullockies often chose Devon cattle {{because they}} were plentiful, hardy, {{tractable}} and readily matched up the team, which was often {{a source of pride}} to the owners. Teams had to be educated to perform their respective tasks, too. The first part of a bullock’s education began when the bullocky tied two young bullocks together with two heavy leather collars and a connecting chain. Thus connected they were turned out to graze and rest until they accepted the close presence of their partner. Untrained bullocks were then put in the centre of the team, where they were more easily controlled with the assistance and guidance of the [...] "leaders” who were well trained to verbal commands. Pairs of bullocks were matched for size and yoked together using a wooden yoke secured to each bullock by a metal bow which was fixed in place by key on <b>top</b> of the <b>yoke.</b> Each pair was connected by a special chain, which ran from a central ring on each yoke to the next pair, thus coupling the team in tandem fashion. The “wheelers” or “polers” were the older, heavier, trained bullocks which were closest to the dray or jinker and helped to slow the load when necessary. Thus then was the team attached to the dray or jinker.|$|R
5000|$|The Blackhope Burn joins Moffat Water {{close to}} a farm called Capplegill (OS. Ref. NT147098) on the A708. Just to the north east of Capplegill (roughly 150 metres) {{there is room for}} a car or two to park by Blackshope house. The classic walk from here is to head north from where you are parked passing through a field where there are usually Belted Galloways to be seen, and up onto Saddle Yoke which as the name implies has two tops with a short saddle between them. These <b>tops</b> are Saddle <b>Yoke</b> (just over 630 metres high [...] ) and Under Saddle Yoke (745 metres. [...] From there descend to the water course in Whirly Gill before {{climbing}} to the top of Saddle Craigs {{at the head of the}} Blackhope Glen and just below Hartfell Rig (739 metres). An alternative to this is to go up onto the rig itself but that would be to miss the views from the top of the crags that are Saddle Craigs. Now climb to the summit of Hartfell (808 metres) and then follow the ridge from there back to Capplegill going over Swatte Fell (729 metres) en route. In other words, this route goes up one side of the hills above Blackhope Glen and back down the other. The crags on this return leg are quite spectacular (particularly around Hound Shoulder) with views over the glen to Saddle Yoke then Carrifran Gans (757 metres) and White Coomb (821 metres and the highest hill in the Moffat hills) beyond. Capplegill is also a useful access point to the Ettrick Hills which lie south of Moffatdale.|$|R
