50|$|It {{is normal}} for IP {{protocol}} stack software to keep many copies of different IP packets, for <b>transmission,</b> <b>reception</b> {{and to keep}} copies in case {{they need to be}} resent. uIP is economical in its use of memory because it uses only one packet buffer. First, it uses the packet buffer in a half-duplex way, using it in turn for transmission and reception. Also, when uIP needs to retransmit a packet, it calls the application code in a way that requests for the previous data to be reproduced.|$|E
50|$|Semiotics is {{the study}} of the <b>transmission,</b> <b>reception</b> and meaning of signs and symbols in general. In this field, human {{language}} (both natural and artificial) is just one among many ways that humans (and other conscious beings) are able to communicate. It allows them to take advantage of and effectively manipulate the external world in order to create meaning for themselves and transmit this meaning to others. Every object, every person, every event, and every force communicates (or signifies) continuously. The ringing of a telephone for example, is the telephone. The smoke that I see on the horizon is the sign that there is a fire. The smoke signifies. The things of the world, in this vision, seem to be labeled precisely for intelligent beings who only need to interpret them in the way that humans do. Everything has meaning. True communication, including the use of human language, however, requires someone (a sender) who sends a message, or text, in some code to someone else (a receiver). Language is studied only insofar as it is one of these forms (the most sophisticated form) of communication. Some important figures in the history of semiotics, are Charles Sanders Peirce, Roland Barthes, and Roman Jakobson. In modern times, its best-known figures include Umberto Eco, A.J. Greimas, Louis Hjelmslev, and Tullio De Mauro. Investigations on signs in non-human communications are subject to biosemiotics, a field founded in the late 20th century by Thomas Sebeok and Thure von Uexküll.|$|E

It also includes the interaction & interface of microwave signals with digital & optical circuitry & interconnecting transmission media. Examples include optical waves in suitably confined structures, as well as the applications of acoustic, magnetic, & plasmonic waves to microwave systems.Radio frequency (RF) is a term that refers to signals and associated currents having characteristics such that, if the current is input to an antenna, an electromagnetic (EM) field is generated suitable for wireless broadcasting and/or communications, radar, etc. These frequencies cover {{a significant portion of the}} electromagnetic radiation spectrum, extending from about 9 kHz, the lowest allocated wireless communications frequency (if it were audible it would be within the range of human hearing), to thousands of gigahertz (GHz). The discipline of microwave theory & techniques applies physical and mathematical principles to analyze devices, components and structures that interact with electromagnetic fields and often have dimensions representing a significant fraction of a wavelength, or when in-circuit wave propagation effects need to be considered.The Society's focus shall include scientific, technical, and industrial activities, subject to timely modifications approved by the IEEE Technical Advisory Board. Technical Committee focus areas of interest include microwave and millimeter-wave materials, solid state devices and integrated circuits, filters, passive components and packaging, microwave acoustics and photonics, high power and low noise techniques, frequency conversion, field theory, and computer aided design and measurements. In addition, the Society is involved in terahertz technology, ultra-wide band and microwave systems, and multidisciplinary activities such as RF microelectromechanical (RFMEMS) devices, radio frequency identification devices (RFIDs), digital signal processing, biological effects and medical applications, and business issues.|$|E
