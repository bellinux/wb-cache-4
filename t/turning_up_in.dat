5|$|After {{disappearing from}} Belgium before {{the onset of}} the 20th century, it has {{returned}} to breed in the Belgian Ardennes, Luxembourg and Burgundy, France, by 2000. It appears to be increasing in numbers in Spain and Portugal, where the population was estimated at 405 to 483 pairs in 2006. The black stork is a rare vagrant to the British Isles, <b>turning</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the warmer months—particularly in spring—generally in the south and east. Sightings have become more common since the 1970s as its breeding range moves northwards. It has been recorded in Scotland six times between 1946 and 1983, including from Shetland, Orkney and the Highlands, as well as the Scottish Borders (Peebles). It is not abundant in the western parts of its distribution, but more densely inhabits eastern Transcaucasia. Further east, it has been recorded from locations across Iran, though little is known about its habits there; breeding has been recorded from near Aliabad in Fars province, Khabr National Park in Kerman province, Karun river in Khuzestan province, Qaranqu River in East Azarbaijan province, and Aliabad river in Razavi Khorasan province. The population has declined in Iran due to draining of wetlands. East of the Ural Mountains, the black stork is patchily found in forested and mountainous areas up to 60°‒63° N across Siberia to the Pacific Ocean. South of Siberia, it breeds in Xinjiang, northwestern China, northern Mongolia south to the Altai Mountains, and northeastern China south to the vicinity of Beijing. In the Korean Peninsula, the black stork is an uncommon summer visitor, no longer breeding in the south since 1966. Birds have been seen in the northeast but it is not known whether they breed there. Similarly it has been seen in the summer in Afghanistan, but its breeding status is uncertain.|$|E

The three coins ceased to be valid in theory in 1912 but the lower two denominations were still <b>turning</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> general circulation as late as 1930. The two bronze coins are frequently used for magico-religious purposes. All three coins bore similar inscriptions, including the date 1308 AH, which corresponds to the Gregorian calendar years 1890/91 AD.|$|E

25|$|The first {{memorial}} to the duel was constructed in 1806 by the Saint Andrew's Society, of which Hamilton was formerly a member. A 14-foot marble cenotaph, consisting of an obelisk topped by a flaming urn and a plaque with a quote from Horace surrounded by an iron fence, was constructed approximately where Hamilton was believed to have fallen. Duels continued to be fought at the site and the marble was slowly vandalized and removed for souvenirs, leaving nothing remaining by 1820. The memorial's plaque survived, <b>turning</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a junk store and finding {{its way to the}} New-York Historical Society in Manhattan, where it still resides.|$|E
25|$|American {{researcher}} William Thompson {{headed the}} research team for the IPSFC, which tagged fish at various upstream locations, from which data could be collected for analysis. One of these sites was at Hells Gate, where scientists captured salmon along the banks with fill nets, tagged them, removed some of their scales for racial analysis, and then released {{them back into the}} river. In 1938, the IPSFC discovered {{what appeared to be a}} blockage of Fraser sockeye salmon at Hells Gate. Fish were <b>turning</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> tagging nets more than once, being held up behind the narrow passage of river, and re-appearing far downstream after being tagged. Based on these findings, Thompson decided to place increased emphasis on Hells Gate beginning in 1939.|$|E
25|$|The rarest {{reported}} type of Eucharistic miracle {{is where}} the Eucharist becomes human flesh as in the miracle of Lanciano which some Catholics believe occurred at Lanciano, Italy, in the 8th century A.D. In fact, Lanciano {{is only one of}} the reported cases of Eucharistic miracles where the host has been transformed into human flesh. However, a Eucharistic miracle more commonly reported by Catholics is that of the Bleeding Host, where blood starts to trickle from a consecrated host, the bread consecrated during Mass. Other types of purported miracles include consecrated hosts being preserved for hundreds of years, such as the event of the Miraculous Hosts of Siena. Other miracles include a consecrated host passing through a fire unscathed, stolen consecrated hosts vanishing and <b>turning</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> churches, and levitating consecrated hosts.|$|E

500|$|The Paratheria {{hypothesis}} {{enjoyed a}} brief renaissance when unusual, high-crowned teeth began <b>turning</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the Cretaceous and Paleocene fossil record of Argentina. In 1984, Sudamerica ameghinoi, from the Paleocene of Argentina, {{was assigned to}} Xenarthra within Paratheria, ranked as a cohort (a taxonomic rank between infraclass and superorder). Two years later, José Bonaparte named Gondwanatherium patagonicum from the Late Cretaceous of Argentina, which he thought {{to be related to}} Sudamerica, and tentatively assigned it to Paratheria, now ranked as an infraclass. Bonaparte described an additional related animal, Vucetichia gracilis, from the Argentinean Late Cretaceous in 1990; by then he classified it in the order Gondwanatheria, which was tentatively assigned to the infraclass Paratheria. Bonaparte argued against George Gaylord Simpson's 1931 view that xenarthrans derive from the Tertiary Palaeanodonta of North America, and instead suggested that xenarthrans, and perhaps pangolins, split from eutherians (placentals and their extinct relatives) as early as the Early Cretaceous and derived from some early [...] "pantothere" [...] (a now-abandoned grouping of early mammals, including dryolestoids among others).|$|E
500|$|Hughes was posthumously {{awarded the}} Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) on 22October 1940 for his [...] "skill and determination" [...] as a flight {{commander}} and [...] "gallantry in his {{attacks on the}} enemy"; Squadron Leader O'Brien had recommended the decoration a week before their deaths. Kay was presented with the medal at Buckingham Palace on 23June 1942. In Australia, Hughes is commemorated at Christ's Church, Kiama, with a memorial tablet placed by his sister Muriel. [...] A special memorial is dedicated to him at Monaghan Hayes Place, Cooma. His name appears on the Battle of Britain Roll of Honour in Westminster Abbey, and on supplementary panel12 in the Commemorative Area of the Australian War Memorial (AWM), Canberra. The AWM also holds his DFC and service medals in its collection. Kay had given the medals to her sisters-in-law {{to pass on to}} Percy in the 1950s and, after being lost during an Anzac Day parade in the 1960s, they went through several family members' hands before <b>turning</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the safe of the Kiama Country Women's Association; they were donated to the AWM in 1990. On 7September 2005, Charles Hall's sons dedicated a plaque in Hughes' honour at the house where he fell in Main Road, Sundridge; Bob Doe attended, expressing his thanks for [...] "an Australian who came to help us when we needed him". Shoreham Aircraft Museum in Kent unveiled a memorial stone to Hughes at Sundridge on 23August 2008. On 15September 2014, the AWM's daily Last Post Ceremony was dedicated to Hughes' memory.|$|E

500|$|The Persona series {{takes place}} in modern-day Japan, and almost always focuses {{on a group of}} high school students. The {{exception}} to this is Eternal Punishment, which instead focused on a group of adults. The setting has been described as urban fantasy, with extraordinary events happening in otherwise normal locations. The typical setting used is a city, with a noted exception being the rural town setting of Persona 4. Although they are typically stand-alone titles that only share thematic elements, the Persona games share a continuity, with elements from previous titles <b>turning</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> later ones. Persona and the Persona 2 games shared narrative elements which were concluded with Eternal Punishment, so Persona 3 started out with a fresh setting and characters. The first in the series is Persona, set in the year 1996. This is followed by the events of Innocent Sin and Eternal Punishment in 1999. At the end of Innocent Sin, the main characters rewrote events to avert the destruction of Earth, creating the Eternal Punishment reality, with the original reality becoming an isolated Other Side. Persona 3 and subsequent titles stem from Eternal Punishment. Persona 3 is set in 2009 to 2010, and Persona 4 is set two years later in 2011 to 2012. The Persona 4 Arena games and Dancing All Night take place in the months following Persona 4. Persona Q {{takes place in}} a separate enclosed world which the characters of Persona 3 and 4 are drawn into from their respective time periods. In contrast, Persona 5 is set in a non-specific year referred to as [...] "20XX".|$|E

2500|$|As {{an example}} of the alleged {{conflation}} of globalization, the U.S. and Israel, Josef Joffe, editor and publisher of Die Zeit and adjunct professor at Stanford University, cited José Bové, a French anti-globalization activist and leader of the Confédération Paysanne. Bové led what Joffe calls a [...] "deconstructionist mob" [...] against McDonald's to protest against its effects on French cuisine, later <b>turning</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Ramallah to denounce Israel and announce his support for Yasser Arafat. [...] "Arafat's cause was Bové's cause ... here was a spokesman for the anti-globalization movement who was conflating globalization with Americanization and extending his loathing of both to Israel." [...] Joffe argues that Kapitalismuskritik is a [...] "mainstay of the antisemitic faith, a charge that has passed smoothly from Jews to America. Like Jews, Americans are money-grubbers who know only the value of money, and the worth of nothing. Like Jews, they seek to reduce all relationships to exchange and money.
