5|$|The {{two main}} {{parts of the}} wreck of Titanic present a {{striking}} contrast. Although fourteen survivors testified <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> had broken apart as she sank, this testimony was discounted by the official inquiries, and it was supposed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> had sunk intact. It {{is now clear that}} the stresses on Titanic caused the ship to split apart between the second and third funnels at or just below the surface.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} sources, {{including}} Gardiner, claim <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> suffered {{a number of}} cracks while firing the guns while ice-bound {{during the winter of}} 1877–78, but this incident cannot be confirmed by Russian-language sources. McLaughlin believes that any such incident would have been mentioned if it occurred, as such sources are otherwise quite candid about the ship's drawbacks.|$|E
5|$|Pieces of the {{original}} timbers were preserved enough to allow scientists to analyse them and determine some {{of the types of}} wood used. It is possible <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> was constructed in western Asia and bought by Arabian merchants to be used for the Oman to China route; the cargo contains many Arabian-inspired artefacts.|$|E
5000|$|After <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> 2015 christening, military-focused {{newspaper}} Stars and Stripes said <b>that</b> {{criticism of}} <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> naming had become [...] "muted", possibly due to recognition <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> naming was [...] "by no means unprecedented." ...|$|R

5000|$|They {{were afraid}} at first <b>that</b> (<b>the</b> <b>ships)</b> might be (lit. may be) hostile.|$|R
5|$|The Admiralty {{initially}} specified <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> {{should be}} capable of , and have {{a full set of}} sails for worldwide cruising range. Iron construction was chosen as it gave the best trade-off between speed and protection; an iron hull was lighter than a wooden one of the same size and shape, giving more capacity for guns, armour and engines.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} number of broadside ironclads {{was built in the}} 1860s, principally in Britain and France, but in smaller numbers by other powers including Italy, Austria, Russia and the United States. The advantages of mounting guns on both broadsides was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> could engage more than one adversary at a time, and the rigging did not impede the field of fire.|$|E
5|$|After {{the ship}} arrived in Invergordon, Baden was {{carefully}} examined by Royal Navy technicians. Naval engineers inspected the hull, including the screws, bilge keels, and rudders, {{to determine the}} water resistance of the hull form. The ship {{was found to have}} been approximately as efficient as the British s. The ship's armor system was extensively investigated; the British team concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> had not been modified to incorporate the lessons from the Battle of Jutland of 31 May– 1 June 1916.|$|E
25|$|Government {{officials}} stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>shipping</b> container {{could not}} be cleared through customs, as proper procedures had not been followed. The Sierra Leonean government refused to pay <b>the</b> <b>shipping</b> fee of $6,500. New York Times noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> government had already received well over $40 million in cash from international donors to fight Ebola. The New York Times noted <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> 2 months <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>shipping</b> container remained on the docks in Freetown, health workers in Sierra Leone endured severe shortages of protective supplies, with some nurses having to wear street clothes.|$|R
25|$|That trade {{continued}} with few interruptions until 1638, {{when it was}} prohibited on <b>the</b> ground <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> were smuggling priests into Japan.|$|R
50|$|The British Government {{announced}} in <b>The</b> London Gazette <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships,</b> including Resolute, were still Her Majesty's property, but no salvage was attempted.|$|R
5|$|At this time, the Maharaja of Baroda, Sayajirao Gaekwad III, was {{travelling}} in England. Cotton secured {{for him a}} {{place in}} Baroda State Service and arranged for him to meet the prince. He left England for India, arriving there in February 1893. In India, Krishna Dhun Ghose, who was waiting to receive his son, was misinformed by his agents from Bombay (now Mumbai) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> on which Aurobindo had been travelling had sunk {{off the coast of}} Portugal. His father died upon hearing this news.|$|E
5|$|Cook then ordered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> be {{lightened}} to {{help her}} float off the reef. Iron and stone ballast, spoiled stores and all but four of the ship's guns were thrown overboard, and the ship's drinking water pumped out. The crew attached buoys to the discarded guns {{with the intention of}} retrieving them later, but this proved impractical. Every man on board took turns on the pumps, including Cook and Banks.|$|E
5|$|Following {{decommissioning}} in 1997, {{the ship}} was earmarked for preservation as a museum ship in Mumbai. Lack of funding prevented progress on the ship's conversion to a museum and it was speculated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> would {{be made into a}} training ship. In 2001, {{the ship was}} opened to the public by the Indian Navy, but the Government of Maharashtra was unable to find a partner to operate the museum on a permanent, long-term basis and the museum was closed after it was deemed unsafe for the public in 2012.|$|E
50|$|That trade {{continued}} with few interruptions until 1638, {{when it was}} prohibited on <b>the</b> ground <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> were smuggling priests into Japan.|$|R
25|$|In summer 2016, {{observers}} noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> lifeboats were lowered {{and stored}} {{on a nearby}} parking lot, and the lifeboat davits were removed.|$|R
50|$|Informed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> {{radio was}} not working, Christy {{despatched}} the gunnery officer {{to the mainland}} with a boat crew to summon rescue vessels.|$|R
5|$|Inappropriate {{handling}} {{in rough}} weather {{was the most}} obvious cause for Kronans sinking. Unlike Vasa, Kronans sailing characteristics were not inherently flawed and the ship had served for several years in rough seas. During {{the work of the}} commission, artillery officer Anders Gyllenspak even made direct comparisons to Vasa. He testified that Kronans ballast had been lightened at Dalarö {{at the beginning of the}} campaign and that she had not replenished her supply of drink, so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> had a shallower draft and would have been somewhat less stable than with full stores, though he did not blame this on Creutz.|$|E
5|$|John Ratzenberger and Kathy Najimy as John and Mary, respectively. John and Mary both {{live on the}} Axiom and are so {{dependent}} on their personal video screens and automatic services that they are oblivious to their surroundings, for instance not noticing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> features a giant swimming pool. However, they are brought out of their trances after separate encounters with WALL-E, eventually meeting face-to-face for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Libia {{marked a}} major {{advancement}} over earlier designs, owing {{in large part}} due to the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> was originally ordered by the Ottoman Navy. Based on the British-built , the ship was to have been named Drama, but the Ottoman government failed to make payments so construction stopped, and she was seized after the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish War and completed for the Regia Marina. She was significantly larger, faster, and more heavily armored than the other Italian protected cruisers, but she carried a weaker main battery.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013, the Defence Ministry of Yemen {{reported}} seizing an Iranian <b>ship,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> cargo included (among {{its other}} weapons) Katyusha rockets.|$|R
50|$|In 2014, the USN {{considered}} outsourcing {{the management}} of the fleet, but concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> would continue to be manned by civil service mariners.|$|R
5000|$|Gaudentius {{and his two}} companions {{were then}} put on board an {{unseaworthy}} vessel; it was alleged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship’s</b> captain had orders to wreck them.|$|R
5|$|Limitations {{imposed by}} the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty {{prevented}} the class from being completed as designed. However, the treaty had a limited allowance for hulls already under construction to be converted into aircraft carriers. Amagi and Akagi were both intended for conversion, but an earthquake damaged the hull of Amagi so extensively <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> was scrapped. Akagi was reconstructed as an aircraft carrier and served with distinction {{as part of the}} Kido Butai during the Second World War, participating in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor before being sunk at the Battle of Midway.|$|E
5|$|On 31 May, Ajax, {{under the}} command of Captain George Baird, was the second ship from the head of the battle line after deployment. She fired one salvo of six common pointed, capped shells at the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group shortly after 19:00, but had to cease fire {{immediately}} afterwards when her view was obstructed by the ships of the 4th Light Cruiser Squadron. That was the only time <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> fired her weapons during the battle.|$|E
5|$|Previous {{practices}} had required {{ships to}} withstand the flooding of a single forward hold, but did not guard against situations where two holds would flood. The case where two after (rear) holds are flooded is no better, because the engine room is quickly flooded, leaving the ship without propulsion. If two holds {{in the middle of}} the ship are flooded, the stress on the hull can become so great <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> snaps in two.|$|E
6000|$|... "But," [...] began Davidson, and then, [...] "Yes--that's <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> I dreamt of, I'm sure <b>that's</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> I dreamt of. She was {{standing}} off an island that swarmed with penguins, and she fired a gun." ...|$|R
5000|$|Galileo's intrigue for tidal {{theory was}} {{motivated}} by a boat trip in 1595. While aboard a ferry carrying freshwater to Venice, Galileo noticed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> cargo would undulate {{in accordance with the}} rocking of <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>ships</b> were {{originally}} {{to be named}} Queenston and Chateauguay, for battles from the War of 1812. This decision was reversed in September 2017, {{when it was announced}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> would perpetuate <b>the</b> names Protecteur and Preserver.|$|R
5|$|Sources also {{disagree}} on the number rescued and final death toll. The official history of the ship gives 36 rescued and 336 dead, and the Navios de Guerra Brasileiros gives 36and 339. Contemporary news articles also published varying numbers; {{in an article published}} a day after the accident became known, The Evening Independent stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> carried 383men, though it did not give any more information. The New York Times gave figures of 28saved and 347lost, while the St. Petersburg Times gave 32and 395. Sources do agree, however, that four American sound technicians were killed.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} scored {{four hits}} and three near misses on and around Arizona. The near miss off the port bow {{is believed to}} have caused observers to believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> had been torpedoed, although no torpedo damage has been found. The sternmost bomb ricocheted off the face of Turret IV and penetrated the deck to detonate in the captain's pantry, causing a small fire. The next forwardmost hit was near the port edge of the ship, abreast the mainmast, probably detonating {{in the area of the}} anti-torpedo bulkhead. The next bomb struck near the port rear 5-inch AA gun.|$|E
5|$|The first {{armoured}} cruisers {{had been}} built in the 1870s, as an attempt to give armour protection to ships fulfilling the typical cruiser roles of patrol, trade protection and power projection. However, the results were rarely satisfactory, as the weight of armour required for any meaningful protection usually meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> became almost as slow as a battleship. As a result, navies preferred to build protected cruisers with an armoured deck protecting their engines, or simply no armour at all.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} speculated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> actual {{destination}} was Eritrea, and that its cargo was small arms and chemical weapons for Islamist anti-government rebels in Somalia.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ship</b> become hard fast on {{the reef}} in a {{position}} with the island's light bearing 075 degrees true distant about 0.35 mi; <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> engines continued to run ahead until about 04:00 hours when they were stopped.|$|R
5000|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> name 'kaisei' {{could also be a}} play on words, with the word meaning [...] "reform" [...] in Japanese (written [...] "改正").|$|R
