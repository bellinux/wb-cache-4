40|$|Ecological {{modernisation}} {{theory has}} been offered as a possible solution to the environmental problems currently facing advanced industrial countries. It suggests that regulation can help to solve environmental problems whilst {{at the same time}} making industry more competitive. In theory this can be achieved if regulation encourages the development and application of innovative technologies and production techniques. This paper examines the contribution that an understanding of innovation theory can make to this debate. An understanding of how innovation takes place suggests that to some extent regulation can achieve what is suggested by ecological modernisation theory. This is particularly the case if it helps companies to overcome the considerable barriers to innovation which prevent them from moving beyond control technologies to consider clean technologies, from complementing <b>technological</b> <b>change</b> with <b>organisational</b> <b>change</b> and from exploring the strategic as well as the operational opportunities for improvement. This argument is assessed empirically through an examination of the implementation and impact of integrated pollution control (IPC), as introduced in England and Wales as part of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Here it is shown that there are examples of combined economic and environmental improvement in industry {{as a result of the}} implementation of IPC, particularly where pollution inspectors have helped to develop the capacity of regulated firms to respond to the regulation. However, it is also shown that IPC fails to fully establish the imperative for action on environmental issues. Thus, whilst encouraging <b>technological</b> and <b>organisational</b> <b>changes,</b> it fails to establish the environment as a strategic concern in industry and as a result it is unlikely to promote the radical innovations that are associated with ecological modernisation in the longer-term...|$|R

Autor et al. 2003; Spitz-Oener 2006; Acemoglu and Autor 2011; Green 2012). This research agenda has been stimulated by the collection of task-related data in a number of countries, often for purposes quite unrelated to labour market research. In the US, the Dictionary of Occupational Titles data, which had been collected for several decades, reached its final form in 1991, and was replaced eventually in 2008 by the O*NET Database. In the UK, task-based data was collected with the Skills and Employment Surveys since 1997, and educational job requirements data since 1986. In Germany, employment surveys incorporating task data have been collected since 1979.

30|$|While job {{requirements}} data {{are useful for}} understanding the role of education, training and the skills supply system, {{as well as the}} consequences of <b>technological</b> and <b>organisational</b> <b>change,</b> perhaps their most telling potential application is in the study of pay. The idea that education or training generates skills, at some cost, which is then reflected in higher pay, is a central plank of human capital theory. The idea that skills might have an additional return in the labour market, above that which can be accounted for by known indicators of skill formation, adds further motivation. Education and prior training do not fully capture a person’s work skills. Any additional premium will be either a return to unobserved acquisition costs, or a rent or quasi-rent. If the premium is substantial and is changing it becomes a candidate for explaining the changing wage distribution, especially changing within-education-group inequality.|$|R

We use matched employer-employee data to link changes occurred at the firm level with knowledge transmission behaviours measured at the individual-level. To control for selection bias based on differences in observable characteristics between workers employed in changing work environments and those employed in non-changing ones, we apply propensity score matching techniques. We find that ICT and management changes reduce significantly the probability for workers over 45 of transmitting their knowledge to their colleagues. Then, we analyse the role of training in mitigating this negative impact. To address issues of self-selection into training, we use propensity score matching methods and a proxy for unobservable productivity. We show that participation in a training program regarding ICT tools may help older workers restore their role of knowledge transmitters.|$|R

40|$|Australia {{leads the}} world {{in some areas of}} {{photovoltaic}} technology development, yet current innovation system limitations have seen local innovation overtaken by more rapid international development, or local product development moving offshore for commercialisation. Innovation is traditionally viewed as a linear progression through phases of early research, demonstration, commercialisation and market uptake, and this traditional view strongly emphasises the importance of the early phases. The latest thinking on innovation suggests that technological learning occurs not only through R&D, but also through manufacturing and marketing activities and through the interactions of actors within networks. In this paradigm, technology diffusion, as well as invention and adoption, plays a role in determining the direction of <b>technological</b> <b>change.</b> <b>Organisational</b> <b>change</b> and institutional change, which are critical in determining which technologies become established, are considered to be as important as technical change.

Where much of the past support for the PV industry in Australia has been directed towards early research or market development, this research will provide information that could enable the design of policies that better facilitate innovation throughout the value chain and thus improve the impact of future policies on innovation...|$|R
40|$|In economies where labour {{forces are}} rapidly ageing, one policy-relevant {{question}} regarding <b>technological</b> and <b>organisational</b> innovations {{has to do}} with their labour-market consequences: do they affect the structure of employment and, as a consequence, do they hurt the employment prospects of older workers? This study discusses and tests a set of hypotheses concerning the impact of <b>organisational</b> <b>changes</b> on the observed relative disadvantage older workers face in training opportunities. For this purpose the study uses an Australian matched employer-employee survey, AWIRS- 1995, which has been uniquely designed to capture those <b>technological</b> and <b>organisational</b> <b>change</b> recently experienced by many other OECD economies. Drawing upon previous work on measures of technological change at the industry level the study is able to overcome the endogeneity problem detected in other studies. Finally, differently from the existing literature, the study distinguishes between technological innovation and technological diffusion. New and important findings of this study are that, although technological innovation at the industry level cause economic obsolescence among older workers, industry level technological diffusion increases the oldest workers 2 ̆ 7 training opportunities. Also, the expanded use of alternative employment arrangements (casuals and outsourcing) increases the training opportunities for workers aged 55 and plus and to a less extent, for workers aged 50 and plus.

Rufini (2008) filled this gap, considering young workers that may either learn on their own or benefit from knowledge transmission. In her model, experienced workers are entrusted with transmitting vocational skills to new workers. Here, experience is a process that builds over time and implies that workers with longer tenure are more likely to transmit their skills. However, her model does not explain why older workers are actually under-represented among the trainers since it does not account for <b>technological</b> and <b>organisational</b> <b>changes</b> that may depreciate the value of specific skills accumulated with experience.|$|R

The causal link between innovation and the employment of older people is, because of its complexity, difficult to prove. However, the analysis of employment inflows and outflows between 1998 and 2001 confirms the idea that innovation worsens skill obsolescence.

30|$|If {{graduate}} {{jobs have}} grown substantially, {{what is the}} proximate source of this growth? The growth of graduate jobs is potentially fuelled by two sources. First, there is the employment expansion in core graduate jobs—those occupations that were and have remained graduate-level occupations. While <b>technological</b> and <b>organisational</b> <b>changes</b> {{are thought to be}} the primary source of the evolving demand for skill, it is typically held to be manifested in the asymmetric polarisation of employment. The overall rise in skill demand is often assessed by this structural change alone. However, while it seems likely that structural change in the employment share of occupations will be the main proximate reason for increasing graduate jobs, graduate employment can also grow as a result of occupational upskilling, reflected by a reclassification of some occupations as graduate jobs which previously were non-graduate jobs. Only a few such switchers can contribute strongly to the change in graduate jobs, and in Britain, upgrading occurred with “Social Welfare Associate Professionals”, “Managers in Farming, Horticulture, Forestry and Fishing”, and “Managers and Proprietors in Other Service Industries”, while “Sports and Fitness Occupations” were downgraded.|$|R

40|$|Following {{technical}} and <b>organisational</b> <b>changes,</b> firms may react to increasing skill requirements either by training or hiring the new skills, {{or a combination}} of the two. Using matched datasets with about 1, 000 French plants, we assess the relative importance of these external and internal labour market strategies. We show that skill upgrading following <b>technological</b> and <b>organisational</b> <b>changes</b> takes place mostly through internal labour markets adjustments. Consistently with the results in the literature, we find that new technologies and <b>organisational</b> <b>changes</b> are associated with an upward shift in the occupational structure within firms. We show that about one third of the upgrading of the occupational structure is due to hiring and firing workers on the external labour market, whereas two-thirds are due to promotions. Moreover, we find no compelling evidence of external labour market strategies based on "excess turnover". In contrast, French firms heavily rely on training in order to upgrade the skill level of their workforce. When splitting the sample across sectors, this pattern of results appears to be particularly strong for manufacturing firms whereas, in services, external labour market strategies tend to be more widespread. We then consider the determinants of the strategies chosen by firms. We argue that the relative cost of internal versus external labour market flexibility is likely to be critical and that it can be partly captured by firm size and by the density on the local labour market. We find that external labor market strategies tend to be more important when firms are located on high-density labor markets. {{technical and}} organisational change; turnover; skill bias; training; internal labour markets...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the workforce composition dynamic has been a hot issue in the economic field for many years. The shifting of labour demand towards relatively more skilled workers has been interpreted in several ways.

More recently the role of organizational change has been investigated as well (skill-biased <b>organisational</b> <b>change).</b> The main objective of the present work is to verify the interactions between technological change, organizational change and the workforce composition within an integrated framework that also leads us to consider the role of specific aspects of the industrial relations system.

40|$|The {{shifting}} of labour demand toward relatively more skilled workers {{has been a}} hot issue in the economic field for many years. A consolidated explanation for the upskilling phenomenon is that technological-organisational changes have driven the labour demand with detrimental consequences for less skilled workers (skill-biased technological-organisational change). In order to upgrade the skill workforce the firm has at least two main channels at its disposal: the external labour market strategy, mainly based on hiring and firing mechanisms; the internal labour market strategies, which improve the skill base of the employees through training activities. The main objective of the present work is to verify the relations between innovative strategies and both the workforce composition and the training activities, within an integrated framework that also leads us to consider the role of specific aspects of the industrial relations system. The firm level analysis is based on original datasets which include data on manufacturing firms for two Italian local production systems, located in the Emilia-Romagna region. The {{results suggest that the}} firms use both the two channels to improve their skill base, which is actually related to the innovation activities, although there is weak supporting evidence of the use of external labour markets to upgrade the workforce skills: the upskilling phenomenon seems to be associated to specific innovative activities in the technological sphere, while specific organisational aspects emerge as detrimental for blue collars. On the side of internal labour market strategies the evidence supports the hypothesis that innovation intensity induces the firms to implement internal procedures in order to upskill the workforce, confirming the importance of internal labour market strategies. Moreover, we have recognized the important role of firm level industrial relations in determining the training activities for the blue collar workers. <b>Technological</b> <b>change</b> <b>Organisational</b> <b>change</b> Industrial relations Skills...|$|R

Current institutions must be therefore urgently reformed to reconcile this new need of more flexibility with that of security for workers. The call for “flexicurity ” is not new, but there is no unanimity on the corresponding institutional model it implies. Rather than proposing a reform on the basis of existing institutions abroad, we propose a reform that is explicitly guided by economic principles. In a nutshell, we propose to transform the bulk of the advance notice payments by a unique lay-off contribution, independently of the type of worker (blue or white-collar) and type of contract (temporary or open-ended). A severance payment, less important than the lay-off contribution, is due to cover the psychic cost related to dismissal. In order to make the employer accountable for the costs he imposes on society, the lay-off contribution should be made proportional to the cumulative past earnings since the moment that the worker was hired in the firm. This contribution would b...|$|R
