500|$|Although {{both were}} {{committed}} O.T.O. members, Northrup's usurpation of Helen's role led to {{conflict between the}} two sisters. The reactions of Parsons and Helen towards Northrup were markedly different. Parsons told Helen to her face that he preferred Northrup sexually: [...] "This {{is a fact that}} I can do nothing about. I am better suited to her temperamentally – we get on well. Your character is superior. You are a greater person. I doubt that she would face what you have with me – or support me as well." [...] Some years later, addressing himself as [...] "You", Parsons <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> his affair with Northrup (whom he called Betty) marked a key step in his growth as a practitioner of magick: [...] "Betty served to affect a transference from Helen at a critical period ... Your passion for Betty also gave you the magical force needed at the time, and the act of adultery tinged with incest, served as your magical confirmation in the law of Thelema." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the sixth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Isaac blessed Jacob, asking God {{to give him}} abundance, make peoples serve him, make him master over his brothers, curse those who cursed him, and bless those who blessed him. Just as Jacob left, Esau {{returned}} from the hunt, prepared a dish for Isaac, and asked Isaac for his blessing. Isaac asked who he was, and Esau {{said that it was}} he. Isaac trembled and asked who it was then who had served him, received his blessing, and now must remain blessed. Esau burst into sobbing, and asked Isaac to bless him too, but Isaac answered that Jacob had taken Esau's blessing with guile. Esau asked whether Jacob had been so named that he might supplant Esau twice, first taking his birthright and now his blessing. Esau asked Isaac whether he had not reserved a blessing for Esau, but Isaac answered that he had made Jacob master over him and sustained him with grain and wine, and asked what, then, he could still do for Esau. Esau wept and pressed Isaac to bless him, too, so Isaac blessed him to enjoy the fat of the earth and the dew of heaven, to live by his sword and to serve his brother, but also to break his yoke. Esau harbored a grudge against Jacob, and <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> he would kill Jacob upon Isaac's death. When Esau's words reached Rebekah, she told Jacob to flee to Haran and her brother Laban and remain there until Esau's fury subsided and Rebekah fetched him from there, so that Rebekah would not lose both sons in one day. Rebekah told Isaac her disgust with the idea that Jacob might marry a Hittite woman, so Isaac sent for Jacob, blessed him, and instructed him not to take a Canaanite wife, but to go to Padan-aram and the house of Bethuel to take a wife from among Laban's daughters. And Isaac blessed Jacob with fertility and the blessing of Abraham, that he might possess the land that God had assigned to Abraham. The sixth reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
60|$|Hartley cast a quick, critical, appreciative {{glance at}} her before speaking, and <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> his taste in {{choosing}} had been flawless.|$|E
60|$|Brand <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> {{fiercely}} <b>that</b> {{he was a}} fool. Yet {{the music}} was suddenly sweeter, his vague antipathy to the King had vanished into thin air, the taste of life was sweeter between his teeth.|$|R
6000|$|... "And my father," [...] said Nathan, {{putting down}} {{his foot in}} a very {{positive}} air, [...] "my father <b>told</b> me <b>himself,</b> <b>that</b> a balloon was about as high as my head." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; he <b>told</b> me, <b>himself,</b> <b>that</b> {{he would}} have taken flight at once and, in that case, his kingdom would have been lost; and he himself, sooner or later, hunted down." ...|$|R
60|$|Laverick <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> {{at his age}} he was {{behaving}} like an idiot, nevertheless his eyes across the table expressed his appreciation of her speech.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll fix him, see if I don't," [...] he <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> night. [...] "They shan't tell {{everybody}} that I took that gold piece--when I didn't touch his bag." ...|$|E
60|$|John {{laid his}} hands upon the {{poisonous}} thoughts that had stolen once more into his blood, and <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> he had strangled them. He swept them away {{and glanced at}} his watch.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well--I suppose--I don't know--yes, of course, I do! What {{a stupid}} ass I am. Luke <b>told</b> me <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> {{he was going}} to see his uncle at the Something Club in Shaftesbury Avenue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But no one {{can enter}} it!" [...] Maggie exclaimed. [...] "The place is like a fort. No {{stranger}} may pass the threshold even. The Prince has <b>told</b> me <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> he receives no visitors." ...|$|R
60|$|The truth came on us {{when the}} two fathers returned. Mine <b>told</b> me <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> Frank Fordyce was so much displeased with Griffith's conduct that he had {{declared}} that the engagement could not continue with his consent.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, Charley; I {{will only}} tell you, as I <b>told</b> <b>himself,</b> <b>that</b> I {{thank him for}} doing so, that I am sorry he did so, and that I hope he will do much better, and be happy.' ...|$|E
60|$|His brother's advice he {{understood}} plainly, {{and that of}} his aunt he thought that {{he understood}}. But he shook his head again as he <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> he could not now be guided by either of them.|$|E
60|$|Cyril {{blew out}} the candle, and seated himself at the window. For a time he could see nothing, and <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> the whole {{contents}} of the warehouse might be carried off without his being any the wiser.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{means that}} the attempt to assassinate Prince Shan has failed," [...] she said. [...] "Prince Shan <b>told</b> me <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> he had no {{intention}} of going to the ball. He kept his word. The man who was murdered was one of his suite." ...|$|R
60|$|Douglas was embarrassed--vaguely uneasy. The {{memory of}} Rice's words came {{flooding}} back to him. Whatever else was true, this man's sufferings were real indeed. To {{him she had}} never been anything but a most charming benefactor. In a momentary fit of introspection he <b>told</b> <b>himself,</b> then, <b>that</b> her sex had scarcely ever troubled him.|$|R
60|$|Next instant Felix found himself, he {{knew not}} how, {{struggling}} {{in a wild}} grapple with the dark, black water. A woman was clinging to him--clinging for dear life. But he couldn't have <b>told</b> you <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> minute how it all took place. He was too stunned and dazzled.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} her blankly. It was Sunday, {{and he had been}} looking forward to {{spending}} the day with Mildred. He <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> he must do that in common decency; he could not leave her by herself in a strange house.|$|E
6000|$|That evening Babbitt dined alone. He {{saw all the}} Clan of Good Fellows {{peering through}} the {{restaurant}} window, spying on him. Fear sat beside him, and he <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> to-night he would not go to Tanis's flat; {{and he did not}} go [...] . till late.|$|E
60|$|Lord Castlewell {{sat through}} the {{interview}} somewhat distraught, as well he might be; {{but when it}} was over, and he had taken his leave and kissed her forehead, as he went home in his cab, he <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> he had got through that little adventure very well.|$|E
60|$|Philip {{had thought}} of Norah often. When Mildred left him his first thought was of her, and he <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> bitterly <b>that</b> {{she would never have}} treated him so. His impulse was to go to her; he could depend on her pity; but he was ashamed: she had been good to him always, and he had treated her abominably.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{this is the}} man {{who wishes}} to make the world believe that he is the true heir!--nay, who <b>told</b> me, <b>himself,</b> <b>that</b> he {{considers}} you as only a sort of trustee, to hold half, or two-thirds of the estate, until he has had leisure to sow his wild oats!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As soon as {{the boys}} get back I'll urge them to leave here," [...] he <b>told</b> <b>himself.</b> [...] "If <b>that</b> dam breaks {{we want to be}} on high ground, where the flood can't reach us." ...|$|R
60|$|Gregory lingered {{still in}} the chamber where they had dined, and sat staring moodily before him at the table-linen. Anon, with a half-laugh of contempt, he filled a glass of muscadine, and drained it. As he set down the glass the door opened, and on the {{threshold}} stood a very dainty girl, whose age {{could not be more}} than twenty. Gregory looked on the fresh, oval face, with its wealth of brown hair crowning the low, broad forehead, and <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> in his daughter he had just cause for pride. He looked again, and <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> his brother was right; she had not the air of a maid whose lover returns not from the wars. Her lips were smiling, and the eyes--low-lidded and blue as the heavens--were bright with mirth.|$|E
6000|$|But Black Tom Daly {{sat alone}} gloomily {{in his room}} at Ahaseragh, where it suited him still to be present and look after the hounds, and <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> the {{occupation}} of his life was gone. Who would {{want to buy a}} horse even, now that the chief object for horses was at an end? ...|$|E
60|$|A {{woman of}} whom he inquired for John Swinton's cottage {{told him that it}} was the last on the left. Although he <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> he had nothing to be afraid of, it needed all Ned's {{determination}} to nerve himself to tap {{at the door of the}} low thatched cottage. A young woman opened it.|$|E
6000|$|His words fell {{on empty}} air, his wife having already sped upstairs to pacify Master Smith by a rhythmical and {{monotonous}} thumping on the back. Also she lifted up a thin and not particularly sweet voice and sang to him. Mr. Billing, finishing his supper in indignant silence, <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> grimly <b>that</b> he was [...] "beginning {{to have enough}} of it." ...|$|R
50|$|Zinda {{followed}} this exploit by rescuing the entire Blackhawk {{team from the}} Scavenger, and in return was <b>told,</b> by Blackhawk <b>himself,</b> <b>that</b> she could become an honorary member of the team.|$|R
6000|$|The other--an {{even more}} {{striking}} instance of the possibility, at least, of heroism anywhere and everywhere--is Mr. Thackeray's [...] "Esmond." [...] On the meaning of that book I can speak with authority. For my dear and regretted friend <b>told</b> me <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> my interpretation of it was the true one; {{that this was the}} lesson which he meant men to learn therefrom.|$|R
60|$|He {{hung up the}} {{receiver}} and {{walked out into the}} hall. He was angry with himself because only an hour ago he had <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> he would not make that call. He was angry, too, because the fact of his making it or not making it had assumed a ridiculous importance in his eyes.|$|E
60|$|At length {{he flung}} himself upon his knees to address {{not so much}} a prayer as a maudlin {{grievance}} to his Creator. He felt himself a craven--doubly so by virtue of the peaceful breathing of that sinner he despised--and he <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> it was not in fear a gentleman should meet his end.|$|E
60|$|But {{today he}} felt faintly disturbed. In some strange, indefinable way {{it seemed to}} him that Mary Stella was {{different}} from her usual self. The impression was vague and evanescent--gone before he could decide wherein the difference lay. He <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> he was foolish, yet the vexing, transient feeling continued to come and go.|$|E
60|$|On that {{occasion}} {{there was very}} little more said between them. He had certainly been in earnest, and she had now accepted him. As he went down to his office he <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> now <b>that</b> he had done the best, not only for her but for himself also. And yet I think that she had won him more thoroughly by her former refusal than by any other virtue.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think she}} had no cause to leave me." [...] Phineas as he heard this could not but {{remember}} all that Lady Laura had <b>told</b> <b>himself,</b> and thought <b>that</b> no woman had ever had a better reason for leaving her husband. [...] "There were things I did not like, and I said so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{magnificent}} oak bedroom suite, {{complete and}} as good as new, been in use for three weeks only. The deceased gentleman whose effects we are disposing of, and who {{is known to have}} been a famous collector of valuable furniture, <b>told</b> me <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> he found it at a farmhouse in Northumberland. Look at it, ladies and gentlemen. Look at it. It'll bear inspection. Shall we say forty-five guineas for a start?" ...|$|R
