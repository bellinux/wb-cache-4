40|$|Intraday {{liquidity}} risk {{is a subject}} that applies to all banks, and arises whenever there is a timing mismatch between incoming and outgoing payments within a business day. In case such a mismatch occurs, the bank is exposed to the risk that it is unable to meet its payment obligations at the time expected. A liquidity buffer could help to mitigate this risk. This thesis presents a framework for intraday {{liquidity risk}} management within ABN AMRO Bank, while taking different priorities of transactions into account. We examine the use of extreme value theory (EVT) and propose two metrics to capture the risk: the univariate and multivariate risk metric. The univariate risk metric represents the size of <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> <b>buffer</b> for each priority group separately and provides granular view. Making use of a Monte Carlo simulation algorithm in combination with univariate EVT, {{we are able to}} estimate the size of <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> <b>buffer</b> for a specified time interval within a business day. We forecast the buffer size 30 days out-of-sample and test the violations against the conditional coverage (CC) hypothesis. Satisfactory results are obtained for the groups with high and moderate priority when the highest confidence levels are considered: α = 0. 1 and 0. 05. For the group with low priority, the risk metric performs well for the lowest confidence levels: α = 0. 025 and 0. 01. The multivariate risk metrics aggregates the size of <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> <b>buffer,</b> while taking the diversification of the priority groups into account. We define a failure set and investigate the use of multivariate EVT. Applied Mathematic...|$|E

One essential gauge for assessing liquidity risk exposure is whether banks have sufficient <b>liquidity</b> <b>buffers</b> to survive a potential unexpected funding crisis. In this article, we aim to assess the resilience of Hungarian banks to liquidity shocks by using a <b>liquidity</b> stress test. <b>The</b> test {{is based on a}} hypothetical stress scenario involving a bank-specific liquidity shock, triggered by a confidence crisis,for example.

From their inception, central banks have assumed as one of their key responsibilities the provision of liquidity to banks unable to find it elsewhere. The classical doctrine on the lender of last resort (LLR) was put forward by Bagehot (1873, 96 – 7) : “Nothing, therefore, can be more certain than that the Bank of England [...] . must in time of panic do what all other similar banks must do [...] And for this purpose there are two rules: First. That these loans should only be made at a very high rate of interest [...] Secondly.

40|$|In {{response}} to the 2007 - 08 financial crisis, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision proposed two liquidity standards to reinforce banks’ resilience to <b>liquidity</b> risks. <b>The</b> purpose of this thesis is to analyze <b>the</b> impact of <b>liquidity</b> regulation on bank behavior. The first of four main chapters analyzes the development of global liquidity standards, their objectives {{as well as their}} interaction with capital standards. The analysis suggests that regulating capital is associated with declining <b>liquidity</b> <b>buffers.</b> <b>The</b> interaction of <b>liquidity</b> regulation and monetary policy, the view that regulating capital also addresses liquidity risks as well as a lack of supervisory momentum were important factors hampering <b>the</b> harmonization of <b>liquidity</b> regulation. Chapter 3 takes a wide view on <b>the</b> impact of <b>liquidity</b> regulation on banks' <b>liquidity</b> management. <b>The</b> key question is whether <b>the</b> presence of <b>liquidity</b> regulation substitutes banks' incentives to hold liquid assets. The cross-country analysis suggests that most bank-specific and country-specific determinants of banks’ <b>liquidity</b> <b>buffers</b> are substituted by liquidity regulation while a bank's disclosure requirements become more important. The complementary nature of disclosure and liquidity requirements provides a strong rationale for considering them jointly in the design of regulation. Chapter 4 zooms in on one of the key questions regarding the interaction of the LCR with monetary policy transmission. The analysis shows that a liquidity requirement causes short-term and long-term interest rates as well as demand for long-term loans to increase. However, banks do not seem able to pass on the increased funding costs in the interbank market to their private sector clients. Rather, a liquidity requirement seems to decrease banks' interest margins, which might require central banks to use a representative real economy interest rate as additional target for monetary policy implementation. Chapter 5 is motivated by the European sovereign debt crisis and analyzes the impact of preferential regulatory treatment on banks’ demand for government bonds. The analysis suggests that preferential treatment in liquidity and capital regulation increases banks' demand for government bonds beyond their own risk appetite. Liquidity and capital regulation also seem to incentivize banks to substitute other bonds with government bonds. The thesis concludes with an epilogue on liquidity stress testing...|$|R

The main {{objective of the}} present study was to develop, validate and test <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> mismatch index (LMI) developed by Brunnermeier, Krishnamurthy and Gorton (2012) empirically. Building on the work of these prior studies, the study undertook to develop a measure of liquidity that integrates both market liquidity and funding liquidity within a context of asset liability management. Liquidity mismatch indices were developed and then tested empirically to validate them by regressing them against the known determinants of <b>liquidity.</b> Furthermore, <b>the</b> study investigated <b>the</b> nexus between <b>liquidity</b> and profitability. <b>The</b> unit of analysis was a panel of 12 South African banks over the period 2005 – 2015. The study developed two <b>liquidity</b> measures – <b>the</b> bank <b>liquidity</b> mismatch index (BLMI) and <b>the</b> aggregate <b>liquidity</b> mismatch index (ALMI) – whose performances were compared to and contrasted with <b>the</b> Basel III <b>liquidity</b> measures and traditional liquidity measures using a generalised method of moments (GMM) model. Overall, <b>the</b> two constructed <b>liquidity</b> indices performed better than other <b>liquidity</b> measures. Significantly, <b>the</b> ALMI provided a better macro-prudential liquidity measure that can be utilised in dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, thus presenting a major contribution to the body of knowledge. Unlike the LMI, the BLMI and ALMI can be used to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> of a given bank under liquidity stress events, which are scaled by theoretically motivated and empirically supported <b>liquidity</b> weights. <b>The</b> constructed BLMI contains information regarding <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk within <b>the</b> context of asset liability mismatches, and the measure used comprehensive data from bank balance sheets and from financial market measures. <b>The</b> newly developed <b>liquidity</b> measures are based on portfolio management theory as they account for <b>the</b> significance of <b>liquidity</b> spirals. Empirical results show that banks increase their <b>liquidity</b> <b>buffers</b> during times of turmoil as both BLMI and ALMI improved during the period 2007 – 2009.

In the third study, we estimate the liquidity-adjusted portfolio ES for a long equity portfolio with <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> constraints. Portfolio pure market P&L scenarios are based on initial positions, and <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> adjustments are based on positions sold, which depend on <b>the</b> specified <b>liquidity</b> constraints. Portfolio pure market P&L scenarios and state-dependent liquidity adjustments are integrated to obtain liquidity-adjusted P&L scenarios. Then, we apply <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> score method (Meucci, 2012) on the liquidity-plus-market P&L distribution to quantify <b>the</b> market <b>liquidity</b> for <b>the</b> portfolio. The results show the importance of pricing liquidity risk with <b>liquidity</b> constraints. <b>The</b> liqiii uidity costs can vary greatly on different liquidity policies, portfolio MtM values, market situation and time to liquidation...|$|R
