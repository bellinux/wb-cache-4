40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} packet {{generation}} and measurement tool for communication networks, called the Lightweight Universal Network Analyzer (LUNA). LUNA {{is designed to}} allow per packet analysis, and has been optimized for use with PREEMPT RT Linux to enhance realtime performance. A timing analysis shows the advantages this provides for precise packet generation. LUNA also works on standard Linux kernels, albeit with reduced precision. Mimicing realistic network loads for analysis may require the creation of packets with various interval and size patterns. LUNA supports this by offering a flexible packet parameter generation API, allowing the implementation of random distributions or other parameter sources as needed. LUNA features a multi-component design, which includes the core traffic generator, analysis tools, and a remote control system. Separating traffic generation and recording from analysis improves flexibility, and even allows re-evaluating results retrospectively. The remote control system supports distributed network analysis using a single comprehensive control file containing <b>transmission</b> <b>definitions.</b> Performance analysis shows {{that it is possible}} to reach single digit microsecond timing precision in packet generation with LUNA, but it also shows that the degree to which software precision translates into on-the-wire transmissions strongly varies depending on the networking hardware used, even within one type of network. These results highlight the importance of choosing measurement equipment carefully, even when only off-the-shelf hardware is available. Finally, two example applications of LUNA are presented. One is a throughput analysis of a software defined networking (SDN) testbed for traffic with certain characteristics, the other a round trip time analysis of a real world LTE (4 G) mobile network...|$|R

Having an effect on a marginalized group usually depends on effective collaboration with people they trust. Researchers from the University of North Carolina School of Public Health developed a trust-based collaboration with community members of a rural county in North Carolina to implement an STD prevention program that, in turn, relied on trust in local social networks. As part of the STD prevention demonstration project, the research team established a community resource group made up of local African Americans who helped design, implement, and evaluate the intervention. The group identified 21 women to whom others in the community turned for advice on sex and STDs. These women were trained as lay health advisors to disseminate information and skills for preventing STDs among their social networks. Through face-to-face structured interviews before and after the intervention, the authors measured improvements in STD treatment and prevention behaviors. The proportion of people practicing each of the targeted behaviors improved during the evaluation period. In addition to disseminating information through their own social networks, the lay health advisors demonstrated new skills and a desire to interact with local care providers to influence the provision of care for STDs for low-income African Americans in this county. Each participant in the collaboration played a role in establishing or building upon trust with others.

The different transmission scenarios associated {{to a group of}} interdependent media data units are abstracted in terms of a finite alphabet of policies, for each single data unit. A rate-distortion optimized markovian framework is proposed, which supports the use of comprehensive feedback information. Contrarily to previous works in rate-distortion optimized streaming, whose <b>transmission</b> policies <b>definitions</b> do {{not take into account the}} feedback expected for other data units, our framework considers all the acknowledgment packets in defining the streaming policy of a single data unit. More specifically, the notion of master and slave data unit is introduced, to define dependent streaming policies between media packets; the policy adopted to transmit a slave data unit becomes dependent on the acknowledgments received about its masters. One of the main contributions of our work is to propose a methodology that limits the space of dependent policies for the RD optimized streaming strategy. A number of rules are formulated to select a set of relevant master/slave relationships, defined as the dependencies that are likely to bring RD performance gain in the streaming system.

The clinical signs of malaria are nonspecific, and parasitemia accompanied by a fever may {{not be sufficient to}} define an episode of clinical malaria in endemic areas. We defined and quantified cases of malaria in people of different age groups from 2 areas with different rates of transmission of malaria. METHODS: A total of 1602 people were followed up weekly for 2 years, and all the cases of fever accompanied by parasitemia were identified. Logistic regression methods were used to derive case {{definitions of}} malaria. RESULTS: Two case definitions of malaria were derived: 1 for children 1 - 14 years old and 1 for infants (or = 15 years old). We also found a higher number of episodes of clinical malaria per person per year in people from an area of low transmission of malaria, compared with the number of episodes in those from an area of higher transmission (0. 84 vs. 0. 55 episodes/person/year; incidence rate ratio, 0. 66 [95 % confidence interval, 0. 61 - 0. 72]; P<. 001).

40|$|The Gram-positive {{pathogen}} Streptococcus pneumoniae is a {{major cause}} of community acquired pneumonia as well as of upper respiratory tract infections such as acute otitis media and sinusitis, and invasive diseases like meningitis, bacteremia, and endocarditis. However, S. pneumoniae is also a commensal of the upper respiratory tract, especially of young children, which represent the reservoir for pneumococcal transmission within the community. A major virulence factor of Streptococcus pneumoniae is the polysaccharide capsule. The pneumococcal capsule displays an extremely high variability (it exists in fact in at least ninety different types, known as serotypes) and provides an effective barrier against host-cell mediated phagocytosis allowing bacterial persistence in the blood. In addition to the capsular determinant, many other secreted or surface exposed factors have been described to be of importance for virulence through in vivo animal model studies and in vitro experiments (i. e. choline-binding protein A (CbpA), the pneumococcal toxin pneumolysin, pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA), pneumococcal surface adhesin A (PsaA), pilus components; however, their direct contribution to and essentiality for disease development in humans have still to be determined. Streptococcus pneumoniae pilus islet- 1 (PI- 1) -encoded pilus enhances in vitro adhesion to the respiratory epithelium and may contribute to pneumococcal nasopharyngeal colonization and transmission. The pilus subunits are regarded as potential protein vaccine candidates. In {{the first part of this}} study, we sought to determine PI- 1 prevalence in carried pneumococcal isolates and explore its relationship with transmissibility or carriage duration. We studied 896 pneumococcal isolates collected during a longitudinal carriage study that included monthly nasopharyngeal swabbing of 234 infants and their mothers between the ages of 1 and 24 months. These were cultured according to the WHO pneumococcal carriage detection protocol. PI- 1 PCR and genotyping by multilocus sequence typing were performed on isolates chosen according to specific carriage and <b>transmission</b> <b>definitions.</b> Overall, 35. 2 % of the isolates were PI- 1 -positive, but PI- 1 presence was restricted to ten of the 34 serotypes studied and was most frequently associated with serotypes 19 F and 23 F; 47. 5 % of transmitted and 43. 3 % of non-transmitted isolates were PI- 1 -positive (OR 1. 2; 95 % CI 0. 8 – 1. 7; p 0. 4). The duration of first-ever infant pneumococcal carriage was significantly longer with PI- 1 -positive organisms, but this difference was not significant at the individual serotype level. In conclusion, PI- 1 is commonly found in pneumococcal carriage isolates, but does not appear to be associated with pneumococcal transmissibility or carriage duration. In the second part of this work, we focused on non-typeable Streptococcus pneumoniae (NTPn). NTPns are typically isolated from nasopharyngeal carriage or from conjunctivitis. Since the isolation of NTPn from invasive disease is rare, we characterized the genetic basis for non-typeability of two isolates obtained in Italy from two cases of bacteremic pneumonia. Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) revealed that both NTPn belonged to ST 191, which, according to the MLST database, is associated with serotype 7 F. Sequencing of the capsular locus (cps) confirmed the presence of a 7 F cps in both strains and revealed the existence of distinct single point mutations in the wchA gene (a glycosyltransferase), both leading to the translation of proteins truncated at the C-terminus. To verify if these mutations were responsible for non-typeability of the isolates, a functional 7 F WchA was over-expressed in both NTPn. The two NTPn along with their WchA over-expressing derivatives were analyzed by Transmission Electron Microscopy and by high-resolution magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy. Both NTPn were devoid of a polysaccharide capsule and WchA over-expression was sufficient to restore the assembly of a serotype 7 F capsule on the surface of the two NTPn. In conclusion, we identified two new naturally-occurring point-mutations leading to the non typeability in pneumococcus and demonstrated that WchA is essential for the biosynthesis of the serotype 7 F capsule...|$|R

ConclusionsCTC detection in colorectal cancer (CRC) correlates with pathological stage and clinical outcome in particular in those patients with advanced disease. CRC CTC level before and after CT are an independent prognostic factor for progression-free and overall survival. The positive prognostic value of complete clearance CTC after surgery may be useful to select patients for adjuvant chemotherapy...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{virtualization}} techniques at variuos {{levels of}} a computing system, opens-up to on-demand creation of complex computating systems by gathering resources {{from a larger}} pool of shared resources. This approach, today widely used in modern datacenters, favours new scenarios, which are characterized by an efficient usage of the available hardware resources and reduced sensitivity to failures. A similar approach has been recently proposed {{in the context of}} computer networks, and it is usually referred to as "network virtualization". In the context of the SFINGI project, the Research Unit at Univ. of Napoli Federico II will carry on the following activities: a) selection of the most suitable virtualization technologies to be used in Software Routers; b) contribution to the definition of an architectural reference model, by including into this general model the possibility of adopting virtualization techniques for building Software Routers, and by taking into account the peculiar requirements deriving from the adoption of heterogenous (both wired and wireless) <b>transmission</b> technologies; c) <b>definition</b> of service models for the creation of geographically distributed communication infrastructures based on "virtual" Software Routers, according to the Infrastructure-as-a-Service paradigm; d) definition of potential use-case scenarios that may be implemented through "virtual" Software Routers...|$|R
50|$|With {{the digital}} {{television}} transition, which {{was completed in}} two phases in February and June 2009, the use of digital multicasting has given breed to various networks created for distribution on these multiplexed feeds of new and existing stations. However, for the most part, very few of these networks {{have been able to}} gain a national reach on parity with many of the conventional commercial and non-commercial networks, in part {{due to the fact that}} many stations transmit high definition programming on their main feed in 1080i, which requires a bitrate less compartmentalized for allowing more than one multicast feed (which are generally transmitted in standard definition) without risking diminished picture quality; some alternately transmit their main feed in 720p, which favors multiplexing of more than two subchannels at a time (ATSC 3.0, which began development around the time of the 2009 transition with FCC consideration to replace the current ATSC 1.0 as the technological standard for digital television expected to occur in 2016, utilizes improved compression technology able to fit additional subchannels on a single programming stream as well as allowing for the <b>transmission</b> of high <b>definition</b> content in the 4K resolution format).|$|R
5000|$|On August 23, 2007, KMBC and KCWE {{moved their}} {{operations}} {{into a new}} 53,000 sq ft facility at the Winchester Business Center (located at 6455 Winchester Avenue, near Swope Park) in southeastern Kansas City, Missouri. Announced in 2002, construction of the facility - which was designed in the mold of the Spanish-inspired architectural style of Country Club Plaza, and built by Oklahoma City-based architecture firm Rees and Associates, which also designed the studio facilities of sister stations WDSU in New Orleans and WESH in Orlando - began in June 2005, and was completed in early August 2007. The modern purpose-built concrete and glass studio facility incorporates a master control facility with digital and high <b>definition</b> <b>transmission</b> processing equipment; a two-story 4,500 sq ft production studio; an expanded 8,000 sq ft newsroom; a satellite management center supporting downlink and uplink capabilities; a helistop for KMBC's [...] "NewsChopper 9" [...] helicopter; and surface parking for station employees and guests. The move of operations of KMBC and KCWE formally migrated to the Winchester Avenue studio ended KMBC's 54-year tenure at the Lyric Theatre, which had earlier been sold by the Lyric Opera to real estate firm DST Realty.|$|R
40|$|Citation of the New Testament by the Church Fathers is a {{valuable}} resource in reconstructing {{the early history of}} its text, for the time and place each was writing is known. The Society for Biblical Literature has undertaken a series of studies of the Fathers who wrote in Greek in order to make available this resource and to examine in detail what light it sheds on textual development. Among these, the fourth-century Cappadocian father Gregory of Nazianzus was a prolific writer whose work is largely extant; he made extensive and virtuoso use of Scripture in his orations, poetry and other writings. In this study, Gregory's life and works are outlined; the use he makes of NT citation is described and evaluated from a text-critical perspective; the particular difficulties this entails are discussed; and the sources and method used to identify citation laid out in chapters One to Three. This study aims to retrieve all his references to the Gospels, to match them to their NT source where this can be determined, and to present them with critical apparatus as either citations, adaptations or allusions. Chapters Four to Seven list these references to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. An evaluation of their contribution to our understanding of NT textual development completes the study. Earlier work in the series has attempted to locate the text used by individual Fathers within the main strands of textual tradition by calculating proportional agreement with a carefully selected representative number of manuscripts. These attempts have had mixed results; in this study the small number of uniquely-derived verbatim citations in Gregory's work, the insurmountable difficulties of <b>transmission</b> and <b>definition,</b> and the great loss of material if rigorous criteria for inclusion are applied, justify the omission of this analysis. Instead a more qualitative approach has sought to do justice to the special strengths of Gregory as a witness to the Gospel textual tradition...|$|R
