5000|$|Along {{with the}} rebrand {{of the league}} in 2013, the league made the {{decision}} to change <b>the</b> <b>uniforms.</b> Before, <b>the</b> <b>uniforms</b> in <b>the</b> Lingerie Football League consisted of an athletic bra and underwear that were more revealing than protective. <b>The</b> <b>uniforms</b> had lace and ribbons and the athletes all had to wear garter belts. The league traded these uniforms in for [...] "performance wear." [...] The league felt like <b>the</b> <b>uniforms</b> were too heavy on sex appeal. In accordance with the name change, they thought it was appropriate to also change <b>the</b> <b>uniforms.</b> <b>The</b> new <b>uniforms</b> resemble <b>the</b> <b>uniforms</b> worn by volleyball players.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>uniform</b> and {{insignia}} of the Boy Scouts of America gives a Scout {{visibility and}} creates a level of identity within both the unit and the community. <b>The</b> <b>uniform</b> is used to promote equality while showing individual achievement.

5|$|These {{designs for}} <b>the</b> <b>uniform,</b> however, did not prevail, as the {{complexity}} of <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> proved to be difficult for mass-production.

He stated that <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> should be that of: a gray jacket; a blue, gray, or brown pair of trousers; any slouch hat or cap-type of head cover; and any kind of foot-wear to be worn for Confederate service in mid-1861. His regulations, however, were overruled by the subsequent set of regulations of June 1861, stating the Franco-Austrian styled uniform to be issued and purchased to all corps and by all officers, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Attempts {{were made}} to {{photograph}} the corpse for the naval identity card Martin would have to carry, but the results were unsatisfactory, and {{it was obvious that}} the images were of a cadaver. Montagu and Cholmondeley conducted a search for people who resembled the corpse, finding Captain Ronnie Reed of MI5; Reed agreed to be photographed for the identity card, wearing Royal Marine uniform. As the three cards and passes needed looked too new for a long-serving officer, they were issued as recent replacements for lost originals. Montagu spent the next few weeks rubbing all three cards on his trousers to provide a used sheen to them. To provide a used look to <b>the</b> <b>uniform,</b> it was worn by Cholmondeley, who was about the same build. The only non-issue part to <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> was the underwear, which was in short supply in war-rationed Britain, so a pair of good-quality woollen underwear, owned by the late Herbert Fisher, the Warden of New College, Oxford, was used.|$|E

5|$|Nan Chiau High School's uniform {{is closely}} linked to its {{heritage}} as a former traditional Chinese school. Originally, the school uniform was in full white with the Chinese name of the school sewed on the right chest level of the blouse, much similar to other institutions with Chinese heritage. Students in the senior high and pre-university section wore white shirts with dark coloured skirts, before the pre-university classes were made mandatory to be taught at junior colleges, a policy declared by the ministry of education in 1979. Nearing the 1990s, the school uniform was switched to be worn with dark coloured school pants or skirt, with dark coloured school tag was sewed {{on the left side}} of the shirt. <b>The</b> <b>uniform</b> was redesigned as an effort to preserve the school's identity along with the relocation of the campus in 2000, which integrated the original heritage of <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> in the 1960s and the 1990s.|$|E
