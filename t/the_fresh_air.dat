5|$|Birds {{have one}} of the most complex {{respiratory}} systems of all animal groups. Upon inhalation, 75% of <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. The other 25% of the air goes directly into the lungs. When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lungs and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation. Sound production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from {{the lower end of the}} trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalisations and the perception of the bird's size.|$|E
5|$|By January 1904, {{the ship}} had become the {{flagship}} of the Channel Fleet. As {{a result of a}} reorganization in January 1905, the Channel Fleet became the Atlantic Fleet, and Magnificent accordingly became a part of the Atlantic Fleet. A gun explosion aboard Magnificent on 14 June 1905 resulted in 18 casualties. The explosion was caused by a faulty shell in one of the 6-inch guns; it failed to fire, and when the loader opened the breech, contact with <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> detonated the shell. On 15 November 1906, she ended her Atlantic Fleet service and was paid off at Devonport. Magnificent was commissioned into reserve on 16 November 1906, based at Chatham. During her reserve service, she was attached to the Gunnery School at Sheerness as a gunnery training ship in December 1906.|$|E
5|$|In the sub-basement {{were the}} Sprague screw {{machines}} for the electric elevators, the fire pumps, the house pumps, the ice plant, {{and the six}} Babcock & Wilcox waler tube boilers. The elevator system, which served the house from subbasement to roof, was electric, taking its power from the generating plant within the building. There were 18 elevators. The machinery was located in the sub-basement. The boilers aggregated about 3,000 horse power, the electric generators taking 2,200 horse-power of the total energy. The elevators were run by it, as were the 15,000 incandescent lamps, branching from 7,500 outlets. The system of heating and ventilating the public rooms was that of forced draught by means of powerful blowers situated in the sub-basement that forced <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> between steam-coils, where it became moderately heated before entering the ducts that lead it to the various rooms. This heat was further augmented by direct radiators placed behind screens in the recesses of the windows and elsewhere.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a model-based optimal ventilation control strategy for multi-zone VAV air-conditioning systems aiming at optimizing <b>the</b> total <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> flow rate by compromising the thermal comfort, {{indoor air quality}} and total energy consumption. In this strategy, one scheme is used to correct <b>the</b> total <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> flow rate dynamically by utilizing <b>the</b> unvitiated <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> from <b>the</b> over-ventilation zones based on the detected occupancy of each zone and the related measurements. At the meantime, another scheme is developed to optimize the temperature set point for the temperature control of critical zones with the aim at reducing the variation of <b>the</b> required <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> fractions among all the zones and further reducing <b>the</b> total <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> intake from outdoors for energy saving when the first scheme is implemented. This scheme {{is based on a}} constructed cost function relating thermal comfort, indoor air quality and total energy consumption together while the cost function is calculated based on the prediction of system responses using dynamic simplified models. Genetic algorithm is used for optimizing the temperature set point of critical zones in the optimization process. This strategy was evaluated in a simulated building and air-conditioning environment under various weather conditions. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|As new equipment, <b>the</b> channel wheel <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> {{ventilator}} {{has become}} increasingly popular in recent years. However, when such equipment is operated under low ambient temperature in the freezing area in winter, the formation of frost on the outdoor waste air surface becomes problematic, leading to the degradation of <b>the</b> channel wheel <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ventilator's performance or even the shutdown of equipment. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} have a detailed investigation on the operational characteristics of <b>the</b> channel wheel <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ventilator under frosting in order to guide its application. This paper first reports on the development of a detailed model for the channel wheel heat exchanger, which is the core part of <b>the</b> channel wheel <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ventilator under frosting conditions. The model developed, first seen in open literature, consists of a frosting sub-model and a channel wheel heat exchanger sub-model. This is followed by reporting an evaluation of the operational characteristics of a frosted channel wheel heat exchanger under different ambient conditions using the model developed. These include frost formation {{on the surface of the}} channel wheel heat exchanger, and impacts on the operational performance of <b>the</b> channel wheel <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ventilator. Furthermore, <b>the</b> interval of defrosting is obtained, which provides the basis for the adoption of effective defrosting measures, and thus increasing <b>the</b> channel wheel <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ventilator's energy efficiency and operating reliability...|$|R

He died of a {{ruptured}} splenic artery aneurysm, following blood poisoning and bronchial pneumonia, at 10:35pm on Monday, September 19, 1881, in Elberon, New Jersey. Garfield died two months before his 50th birthday; he and John F. Kennedy are the only two Presidents who died before age 50. During the 79 days between his shooting and death, Garfield's only official act was to sign a request for the extradition of a forger who had escaped, and was apprehended after he fled to Canada.|$|E
25|$|The rooms {{within the}} {{elongation}} are accessed through a 48-foot long, 6-foot wide gallery. The gallery is enclosed in its full length {{through the use}} of an original row of wooden balustrade, supporting operable wooden transoms, movable wooden louvers and wooden shutters, simultaneously providing shade and air, two important local design considerations, as Ponce is known for its hot weather and its implacable sun. Another significant design in Casa Vives related to Ponce's climate is the treatment given to the air circulation within the living quarters. The house has high ceilings, ranging from 14 to 15 feet, to give hot air more space to rise. Adorned ventilation holes are strategically located at the four corners of every room's ceiling, allowing for the heat to exit through the roof and letting the cool air circulate throughout the entire house. <b>The</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> is captured at the roof through a set of brick and masonry ventilation structures, oriented in an east-to-west direction (the usual direction of the wind currents), and channelized to the house interior. Every single room in the house connects to the adjacent room through wooden double doors (some with louvers and shutters, other of solid construction), allowing air to circulate from one space to another. Furthermore, many of the interior doors are crowned with wooden transoms, facilitating the air conduit even with the doors closed. In addition, every single room has, at least, one wooden double door that open toward the exterior.|$|E

As she sits upon the swing, scenes of two children sneaking out of their bungalow in the middle of the night are shown. They frolic together beside a fireplace, soon coming up to the lakeside swing Carey had been on before.

Having possibly witnessed the entire event, Carey is seen once again by the large swing, chuckling and staring into the night's sky.|$|E
