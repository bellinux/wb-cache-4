25|$|There is a 2-1 {{covering}} map {{from the}} torus to the Klein bottle, because {{two copies of}} the fundamental region of the Klein bottle, one being placed next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> image of the other, yield a fundamental region of the torus.

25|$|Three mirrors. If {{they are}} all parallel, the effect {{is the same as}} a single mirror (slide a pair to cancel the third). Otherwise we can find an {{equivalent}} arrangement where two are parallel and the third is perpendicular to them.

It was first printed at the Mirror printing plant, owned by Jesse Yarnell and T.J. Caystile. Unable to pay the printing bill, Cole and Gardiner turned the paper over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mirror</b> Company. In the meantime, S. J. Mathes had joined the firm, and it was at his insistence that the Times continued publication. In July 1882, Harrison Gray Otis moved from Santa Barbara to become the paper's editor. Otis made the Times a financial success.|$|E

25|$|The Mirrors mass {{working class}} {{readership}} {{had made it}} the United Kingdom's best-selling daily tabloid newspaper. In 1960, it acquired the Daily Herald (the popular daily of the labour movement) when it bought Odhams, in {{one of a series}} of takeovers which created the International Publishing Corporation (IPC). The Mirror management did not want the Herald competing with the Mirror for readers, and in 1964, relaunched it as a mid-market paper, now named The Sun. When it failed to win readers, the Sun was sold to Rupert Murdoch – who immediately relaunched it as a more populist and sensationalist tabloid and a direct competitor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mirror.</b>|$|E
25|$|Originally {{pitched to}} the middle-class reader, it was {{transformed}} into a working-class newspaper after 1934, in order to reach a large, lowbrow audience. The Mirror has had a number of owners. It was founded by Alfred Harmsworth, who sold it to his brother Harold Harmsworth (from 1914 Lord Rothermere) in 1913. In 1963 a restructuring of the media interests of the Harmsworth family led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mirror</b> becoming a part of International Publishing Corporation. During the mid 1960s, daily sales exceeded 5 million copies, a feat never repeated by it or any other daily (non-Sunday) British newspaper since. The Mirror was owned by Robert Maxwell between 1984 and 1991. The paper went through a protracted period of crisis after his death before merging with the regional newspaper group Trinity in 1999 to form Trinity Mirror.|$|E
25|$|By 1988, Maxwell's various {{companies}} owned, {{in addition}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mirror</b> titles and Pergamon Press, Nimbus Records, Macmillan, Inc (of which Collier books was a part), Maxwell Directories, Prentice Hall Information Services, and the Berlitz language schools. He also owned a half-share of MTV in Europe and other European television interests, Maxwell Cable TV and Maxwell Entertainment. Maxwell had purchased Macmillan, Inc, the American publishing firm, during 1988 for $2.6 billion. In {{the same year}} he launched an ambitious new project, a transnational newspaper called The European. In 1991, {{he was forced to}} sell Pergamon Press and Maxwell Directories to Elsevier for £440 million to cover his debts; he used some of this money to buy an ailing tabloid, the New York Daily News. Also in 1991, Maxwell sold 49% of the stock of Mirror Group Newspapers to the public.|$|E

If <b>the</b> fourth <b>mirror</b> is {{suspended}} {{such that it}} can rotate around a horizontal axis, the appearance of [...] is extremely sensitive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror’s</b> rotation.

5000|$|In North America, the passé simple {{continues}} to be used, at least more than merely in France.

While it is a literal {{reflection}} of the king and queen, Snyder writes [...] "it {{is the image of}} exemplary monarchs, a reflection of ideal character" [...] Later he focuses his attention on the princess, writing that Velázquez's portrait is [...] "the painted equivalent of a manual for the education of the princess—a mirror of the princess" ...|$|E

500|$|The setup as used by Fizeau {{consists}} of {{a beam of light}} directed at a mirror [...] away. On the way from the source <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> the beam passes through a rotating cogwheel. At a certain rate of rotation, the beam passes through one gap on the way out and another on the way back, but at slightly higher or lower rates, the beam strikes a tooth and does not pass through the wheel. Knowing the distance between the wheel and the mirror, the number of teeth on the wheel, and the rate of rotation, the speed of light can be calculated.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} Foucault replaces the {{cogwheel}} by a rotating <b>mirror.</b> Because <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> keeps rotating while <b>the</b> light travels <b>to</b> <b>the</b> distant <b>mirror</b> and back, <b>the</b> light is reflected from <b>the</b> rotating <b>mirror</b> {{at a different}} angle on its way out than it {{is on its way}} back. From this difference in angle, the known speed of rotation and <b>the</b> distance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> distant <b>mirror</b> <b>the</b> speed of light may be calculated.|$|R

500|$|As {{the sacred}} texts of ancient Hindu and Buddhist {{philosophy}} became available in German translations in the 18th and 19th centuries, they influenced philosophers such as Schopenhauer {{to hold that}} in a healthy mind only deeds oppress our conscience, not wishes and thoughts; [...] "for it is only our deeds that hold us up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> of our will"; the good conscience, thought Schopenhauer, we experience after every disinterested deed arises from direct recognition of our own inner being in the phenomenon of another, it affords us the verification [...] "that our true self exists not only in our own person, this particular manifestation, but in everything that lives. By this the heart feels itself enlarged, as by egotism it is contracted." ...|$|E
500|$|Metcalfe {{reported}} that she was [...] "put forward for Hollyoaks" [...] but had to audition eight times before she was offered the role. She later revealed that when creating the part she took [...] "inspiration" [...] from several places, most prominently from Eva Longoria's role in Desperate Housewives as Gabrielle Solis. In 2008, due to her character's HIV scare, Metcalfe feared she was to going to be fired from the serial and had to seek reassurance from the producer that her fears were unfounded. In 2011 Metcalfe stated her plans {{to stay with the}} serial indefinitely, saying, [...] "I never get bored or lose interest" [...] with her storylines and scripts. In 2012, Kirkwood said that due to Metcalfe being the first actress he cast in Hollyoaks he was [...] "so chuffed that she's becoming a real star". He added that [...] "telling stories for Mercedes is as exciting now as it was on day one". In 2013, Metcalfe revealed <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Mirror</b> that she was proud of portraying the character [...] "everyone loves to hate". In May 2013, Metcalfe signed a new contract keeping her on the soap for at least another year.|$|E

On the South Korea Download International Singles chart, the song debuted at number 68, with sales of 4,310, on 24 November 2012, and peaked at number 22 the following week, with sales of 10,413. In the United Kingdom, [...] "Lovebird" [...] was given an impact date of 9 December 2012, meaning it was only available to purchase as an album track rather than a traditional separate single release. In the chart week immediately after, [...] "Lovebird" [...] sold fewer than 600copies, meaning it failed to attain one of 200chart positions on the UK Singles Chart. As a result, [...] "Lovebird" [...] became Lewis' lowest selling single of her career thus far, and her first release to not chart in the UK. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mirror</b> there was [...] "no real marketing force" [...] behind the single and it [...] "failed to capture the imagination of radio bosses". The newspaper concluded that [...] "most people, unless they have the album, have never heard the song" [...] and {{this was due to}} a lack of airplay.|$|E
