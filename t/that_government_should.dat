5|$|Harding's {{attitude}} toward business was <b>that</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> aid {{it as much}} as possible. He was suspicious of organized labor, viewing it as a conspiracy against business. He sought to get them to work together at a conference on unemployment that he called to meet in September 1921 at Hoover's recommendation. Harding warned in his opening address that no federal money would be available. No important legislation came as a result, though some public works projects were accelerated.|$|E
5|$|Disraeli {{justified}} {{his ideas}} by {{his belief in}} an organic society in which the different classes have natural obligations to one another. He saw society as naturally hierarchical and emphasised the obligation of those at the top to those below. This was based in the feudal concept of noblesse oblige, which asserted that the aristocracy {{had an obligation to}} be generous and honourable; to Disraeli, this implied <b>that</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> be paternalistic. Unlike the New Right, one-nation conservatism takes a pragmatic and non-ideological approach to politics and accepts the need for flexible policies; one-nation conservatives have often sought compromise with their ideological opponents for the sake of social stability. Disraeli justified his views pragmatically by arguing that, should the ruling class become indifferent to the suffering of the people, society would become unstable and social revolution would become a possibility.|$|E
25|$|Some Democratic officeholders have championed {{consumer}} protection laws that limit {{the sharing of}} consumer data between corporations.

25|$|Ramos also {{unveiled}} {{his proposals}} for constitutional {{change of the}} country. Citing {{the need to be}} more economically competitive in the midst of globalization and the need to improve governance for all Filipinos, Ramos suggested <b>that</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> start the process of Charter Change with a set deadline in 2007 (by which time the new charter and new government would take effect). Ramos supports the transformation of the country's political system from the Philippine presidential-bicameral-system into a unicameral parliament in transition to a federal form.|$|E

25|$|Though these {{contributions}} to Dutch literature were a happy {{byproduct of the}} controversy, more important {{from the standpoint of}} enduring political science were the key publications by the democratic republican theorists around Baruch Spinoza that were published {{at the end of the}} 1660s. Franciscus van den Enden, Spinoza's mentor, went beyond the De la Court brothers in his espousal of political democracy in his Free Political Propositions, published in 1665, which is one of the first systematic statements of democratic republicanism in the western world. Van den Enden argued <b>that</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> not only be in the interest of the citizens (as De la Court had proposed), but should create equality of opportunity and be controlled by the people, not the regent oligarchy. Van den Ende acknowledged only two writers that had preceded him with such ideas to his knowledge: Johan de la Court (Pieter's brother with his Consideratiën van Staat of 1660), and Pieter Corneliszoon Plockhoy, whose English-language pamphlet A way propounded to make the poor in these and other nations happy (published in London in 1659) also took aristocrats and priests to task. Plockhoy and Van den Ende first tried to implement their ideas in New Netherland in the early 1660s.|$|E
25|$|After Dix's health {{forced her}} to {{relinquish}} her school, she began working out as a governess for the family of Dr. W. E. Channing. It was while working with this family that Dix traveled to St. Croix, where she first witnessed slavery {{as one of the}} evils of the world. In 1831, she established a model school for girls in Boston, operating it until 1836, when she had another health breakdown. Dix was encouraged to take a trip to Europe to help aid her health by her physician. When she was there she met the other reformers who inspired her to start working on equal rights for the mentally ill. These reformers were Elizabeth Fry, Samuel Tuke and William Rathbone with whom she lived during the duration of her trip in Europe. In hopes of a cure, in 1836 she traveled to England, where she met the Rathbone family. They invited her as a guest to Greenbank, their ancestral mansion in Liverpool. The Rathbones were Quakers and prominent social reformers. At Greenbank, Dix met their circle {{of men and women who}} believed <b>that</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> play a direct, active role in social welfare. She was also introduced to the reform movement for care of the mentally ill in Great Britain, known as lunacy reform. Its members were making deep investigations of madhouses and asylums, publishing their studies in reports to the House of Commons.|$|E
25|$|In 1948 the {{government}} {{set up a}} Land Planning Committee, whose first report recommended <b>that</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> re-acquire land which was either undeveloped or occupied by large numbers of Africans. This included the projected re-purchase of {{about two-thirds of the}} British Central Africa Company’s freehold land. The company had long fought to retain its landholdings, much of which was undeveloped, claiming that soil exhaustion and erosion, deforestation and poor husbandry would result if the land were resettled by smallholders. In 1948, the company was still unwilling to sell its better land to {{the government}}. However, it was prepared to sell inferior land, and in 1948 the government bought freehold land from the British Central Africa Company in the Chingale area {{in the western part of}} Zomba District to convert it to land held by customary tenure and resettle Africans evacuated from other estates in the Shire valley and highlands on it. The Chingale resettlement scheme took place from 1948 to 1954. Following a serious famine in 1949, Geoffrey Colby, the Governor of Nyasaland from 1948 to 1956, attempted to get the major estate companies to sell the under-used parts of their land to the government for resettlement. However, Colby made it clear he would not use the compulsory purchase powers he had been granted, preferring voluntary agreement. By ruling compulsion out, he gave unintended encouragement to the British Central Africa Company’s plans to retain its estates. In 1955, the Nyasaland government agreed to purchase almost 36,470 acres in Cholo District with 24,600 residents from the British Central Africa Company for resettlement. Before this, the company had owned 74,262 acres with 36,400 residents. The company retained 38,143 acres, but of the 11,800 residents, 3,240 were moved onto Crown lands. However, it was only in 1962, when independence was clearly in prospect, that the company accepted the need to sell its surplus land, retaining only its most profitable assets. At the time of its takeover by Lonrho (Malawi) Ltd in 1964, the Central Africa Company Ltd owned a 3,500 acre tea plantation, two tea factories and some other small estates. The Central Africa Company Ltd, with its remaining agricultural assets, was sold by Lonrho to African Plantations Corporation June 1997.|$|E

500|$|... {{portrayed by}} Nick Offerman from the {{situation}} comedy television series Parks and Recreation on NBC, created by Greg Daniels and Michael Schur. In the series, Ron {{is the director of}} the Parks and Recreation department of fictional Pawnee, Indiana, and the immediate superior of series protagonist Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) until Knope's election to the Pawnee City Council at the end of Season 4. [...] In demeanor, political philosophy and work ethic, Knope and Swanson are very nearly polar opposites: where Knope is sunny and outgoing, decidedly liberal and constantly working, Swanson is distant, and as a staunch libertarian, is a strong advocate for small government—stating his belief <b>that</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> be privatized—and therefore believes that the parks department should not even exist.|$|E
500|$|Writer Edgar Lee Masters {{called the}} speech, [...] "the {{beginning}} of a changed America." [...] Bryan's words gave rise to later economic and political philosophies, including Huey Long's 1930s Share Our Wealth program, with its trigger phrase, [...] "Every Man a King" [...] inspired by Bryan's speech. Author and political commentator William Safire, in his political dictionary, traced the term [...] "trickle-down economics" [...] (common in the Reagan era) to Bryan's statement that some believe <b>that</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> legislate for the wealthy, and allow prosperity to [...] "leak through" [...] on those below. Historian R. Hal Williams suggested that the opposite philosophy, of legislation for the masses leading to prosperity for all, advocated by Bryan in his speech, informed the domestic policies of later Democratic presidents, including Franklin Roosevelt with his New Deal.|$|E
500|$|His Capitalism and Freedom {{brought him}} {{national}} and international attention outside academe. It was published in 1962 by the University of Chicago Press and consists of essays that used non-mathematical economic models to explore issues of public policy. [...] It sold over 400,000 copies in the first eighteen years {{and more than half}} a million since 1962. It has been translated into eighteen languages. [...] Friedman talks about the need to move to a classically liberal society, that free markets would help nations and individuals in the long-run and fix the efficiency problems currently faced by the United States and other major countries of the 1950s and 1960s. He goes through the chapters specifying a specific issue in each respective chapter from the role of government and money supply to social welfare programs to a special chapter on occupational licensure. Friedman concludes Capitalism and Freedom with his [...] "classical liberal" [...] stance, <b>that</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> stay out of matters that do not need and should only involve itself when absolutely necessary for the survival of its people and the country. He recounts how the best of a country's abilities come from its free markets while its failures come from government intervention.|$|E

2500|$|In the 19th century, key libertarian thinkers, individualist anarchists and minarchists, {{were based}} in the US, most notably Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker.
