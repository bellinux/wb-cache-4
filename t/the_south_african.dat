Kruger served until 1883 as a member of an executive triumvirate, then was elected President.

50|$|In that year, both organisations sought touring {{teams from}} the UK.

5|$|That year, Chisholm revived <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>African</b> College of Music {{where he}} {{eventually}} would teach composer Stefans Grové and singer Désirée Talbot.

5|$|As {{could be}} expected, {{immediately}} {{after he was}} inaugurated, Reitz contacted the government of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>African</b> Republic with the objective to establish new and closer political ties. Already on 4 March 1889 the Orange Free State and <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>African</b> Republic concluded a treaty of common defence at Potchefstroom. Treaties about trade and the railways were to follow. Even earlier, in January 1889, the Volksraad charged Reitz to negotiate a customs treaty with both the British South African colonies and <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>African</b> Republic. On 20 March 1889 a Customs Conference was held in Bloemfontein which led to an agreement between the Orange Free State and the Cape Colony which was hugely beneficial for the former. The economic benefits grew further when new railway lines were opened between the Cape Colony and Bloemfontein (1890) and between Bloemfontein and Johannesburg (1892), directly connecting Cape Town with Johannesburg and turning the Orange Free State into a transit economy. For Reitz {{the development of a}} unified South African railway system was also a political goal: the railways as a means to diminish mutual distrust and create unity and mutual understanding between the white population of South Africa.|$|E
