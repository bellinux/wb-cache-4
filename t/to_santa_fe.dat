She and the women under her command arrived at Los Alamos, New Mexico on October 21, 1943.|$|E

5|$|Many of the textures were {{accumulated}} {{during a}} three-day trip <b>to</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe,</b> New Mexico. The artists took hundreds of photos of wood, adobe, sand, stucco and other materials, which were treated in Photoshop before being mapped onto the 3D geometry. Whereas many computer-generated environments {{of the time}} ended up looking smooth, like plastic, the Millers and Vander Wende developed a more gritty and weathered design, with corroded and aged elements, to imply reality. The artists considered how objects would look and function if they were real, where and how they would be worn, and created corresponding details. While bump maps were occasionally used to simulate geometry, even small details such as screws were often individually modeled.|$|E
5|$|Melgares was {{the first}} to arrive at the village. His journey north had not been easy. Mutiny had broken out and been {{suppressed}} among his New Mexican militia; and many of his horses had gone lame, or had been stolen by Pawnee raiders. He had left 240 of his men on the Arkansas in southern Kansas before turning northward with the other half of his force. In the Republican village, he met with Kitkehahki and Chaui leaders, to whom he presented gifts, including Spanish flags. The Pawnees agreed to expel Americans from their territory, but also opposed the Melgares expedition's continuing to the Missouri River. In the face of this opposition, and with no supply lines and a force too large to live off the country, Melgares returned to the Arkansas and thence <b>to</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe.</b>|$|E
5|$|In October 2008, Marvel Studios {{signed a}} {{long-term}} lease agreement with Raleigh Studios to photograph their next four films—Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger and The Avengers—at Raleigh's Manhattan Beach, California facility. Production Weekly reported that filming on Marvel's Thor {{was scheduled to}} begin in Los Angeles mid-January, then move <b>to</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe,</b> New Mexico from March until late-April. Principal photography began on January 11, 2010. A few days after filming began, Clark Gregg signed on to reprise his role from Iron Man and Iron Man 2 as Agent Coulson. In February, Paramount Pictures entered negotiations with Del Mar, California to use a 300-yard stretch of beach to film a scene for Thor involving six horses running down the terrain. Paramount said this coastline was ideal because its gradual slope of sand down to the waterline creates excellent reflective opportunities on film. On March 15, 2010, production of Thor moved to Galisteo, New Mexico where Cerro Pelon Ranch, an old-fashioned Western film town, was extensively modified for the shoot.|$|E

25|$|As railroads were {{extended}} into the West, Santa Fe was originally envisioned {{as an important}} stop on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway.
