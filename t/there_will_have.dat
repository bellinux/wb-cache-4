2500|$|Greater income {{inequality}} {{can increase the}} poverty rate, as more income shifts away from lower income brackets to upper income brackets. Jared Bernstein wrote: [...] "If less of the economy's market-generated growth – i.e., before taxes and transfers kick in – {{ends up in the}} lower reaches of the income scale, either there will be more poverty for any given level of GDP growth, or <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> {{to be a lot more}} transfers to offset inequality's poverty-inducing impact." [...] The Economic Policy Institute estimated that greater {{income inequality}} would have added 5.5% to the poverty rate between 1979 and 2007, other factors equal. Income inequality was the largest driver of the change in the poverty rate, with economic growth, family structure, education and race other important factors. An estimated 16% of Americans lived in poverty in 2012, versus 26% in 1967.|$|E

60|$|And {{the point}} lies here. <b>There</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> to come an end. Every race {{which has become}} {{self-conscious}} and idea-bound {{in the past has}} perished.

Our day is pretty short, and closing fast. We can pass, and another race can follow later.|$|E
6000|$|... "While a man {{is alive}} he can carry himself off, but when a fellow is dead it {{requires}} at least one or probably two to carry him.

50|$|The Detour was a task between Arrange and Curving. In Arrange, teams {{made their}} way to Phuc Sen Primary School to find an empty ground. <b>There,</b> teams <b>will</b> <b>have</b> to climb through the hut to look through the requests. They <b>will</b> <b>have</b> to {{instruct}} the other team member to arrange bamboo sticks to the locals. If they arranged the bamboo sticks correctly within 4 minutes, they receive their next clue. In Curving, teams {{made their way}} to Quang Uyen Stadium. <b>There,</b> teams <b>will</b> <b>have</b> to observe a three-minute dragon dance performance performed by the locals and then join in. Putting on a traditional dragon dancer costume, teams will be taking the role of the Dragons Tail. Once teams performed the routine correctly, they received their next clue.|$|R

"To make {{head against}} so many {{extraordinary}} demands," [...] adds the King (looking {{over to a}} new Chapter, that of the MILITARY, which Department, to his eyes, was not less shockingly dilapidated than the CIVIL, and equally or more needed instant repair), [...] "new resources had to be devised. For, besides what was needed for re-establishment of the Provinces, new Fortifications were necessary; and all our Cannon, E'VASES (worn too wide in the bore), needed to be refounded; which occasioned considerable new expense. This led us to improvement of the Excises,"--concerning which <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> to be a Section by itself.|$|E
6000|$|Five {{years more}} (1618), and <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> come a FOURTH Symptom, biggest of all, rapidly consummating the process;--Symptom still famed, of the {{following}} external figure: Three Official Gentlemen descending from a window in the Castle of Prag: hurled out by impatient Bohemian Protestantism, a depth of seventy feet,--happily only into dung, and without loss of life. From which follows a [...] "King of Bohemia" [...] elected there, King not unknown to us;--"thunder-clouds" [...] all in one huge clash, and the [...] "continent of sour smoke" [...] blazing all into a continent of thunderous fire: THIRTY-YEARS WAR, as they now call it!

"You {{know as well}} as I do," [...] said Clarence, {{controlling}} {{his voice}} with an effort, [...] "that what you have done <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> to be undone, if you wish to hold even those lawless men of yours together, or keep yourself and them from being run into the brush like highwaymen. I've no fear for that. Neither do I care to know what was your motive in doing it; but I can only tell you that if it was retaliation, I alone was and still am responsible for Hooker's action at the rancho. I came here to know just what you have done with him, and, if necessary, to take his place." ...|$|E

6000|$|But he insisted, {{thrusting}} {{it under}} her. [...] "You've come along just in time, I wanted {{a woman to}} test it--men are no judges of chairs. There's a vacuum behind the small of your back, isn't <b>there?</b> Augusta <b>will</b> <b>have</b> to put a cushion in it." ...|$|R
60|$|On the {{principle}} {{that there should be}} a name for every thing which we have frequent occasion to make assertions about, there ought evidently to be a name for every Kind; for as it is the very meaning of a Kind that the individuals composing it have an indefinite multitude of properties in common, it follows that, if not with our present knowledge, yet with that which we may hereafter acquire, the Kind is a subject to which <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> to be applied many predicates. The third component element of a philosophical language, therefore, is that there shall be a name for every Kind. In other words, there must not only be a terminology, but also a nomenclature.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Aids {{are talking}} of {{taking up the}} graveyard," [...] said Anne, [...] "and I hope they will, because <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> to be a {{subscription}} for that, {{and it would be}} no use for the Society to try it after the hall affair. But the Aids would never have stirred in the matter if the Society hadn't put it into their thoughts unofficially. Those trees we planted on the church grounds are flourishing, and the trustees have promised me that they will fence in the school grounds next year. If they do I'll have an arbor day and every scholar shall plant a tree; and we'll have a garden in the corner by the road." ...|$|E
60|$|To sum up, {{as far as}} {{the extreme}} {{intricacy}} of the subject permits, the circumstances favourable and unfavourable for the production of new species through natural selection. I conclude that for terrestrial productions a large continental area, which has undergone many oscillations of level, will have been the most favourable for the production of many new forms of life, fitted to endure {{for a long time and}} to spread widely. While the area existed as a continent the inhabitants will have been numerous in individuals and kinds, and will have been subjected to severe competition. When converted by subsidence into large separate islands there will still have existed many individuals of the same species on each island: intercrossing on the confines of the range of each new species will have been checked: after physical changes of any kind immigration will have been prevented, so that new places in the polity of each island will have had to be filled up by the modification of the old inhabitants; and time will have been allowed for the varieties in each to become well modified and perfected. When, by renewed elevation, the islands were reconverted into a continental area, there will again have been very severe competition; the most favoured or improved varieties will have been enabled to spread; <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> been much extinction of the less improved forms, and the relative proportional numbers of the various inhabitants of the reunited continent will again have been changed; and again <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> been a fair field for natural selection to improve still further the inhabitants, and thus to produce new species.|$|E

6000|$|A slow glow {{crept into}} Alton's eyes. [...] "Oh, yes, it's all quite plain," [...] he said. [...] "When {{you find a}} mineral claim {{you have got to}} record it in fifteen days, or {{it goes back to the}} Crown, and I couldn't do that, you see, because I was lying for weeks at Somasco. Well, while the claim is {{unrecorded}} anybody can jump it, but I couldn't get back up there through the snow, and didn't figure Hallam's man knew just where to find it. Now you've told me we'll get in ahead of him yet, and the man he sends up <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> his journey for nothing.

6000|$|... "It {{is quite}} true, Dorian," [...] said Lord Henry, gravely. [...] "It {{is in all}} the morning papers. I wrote down to you to ask you not to see anyone till I came. <b>There</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> to be an inquest, of course, and you must not be mixed up in it. Things like that make a man fashionable in Paris. But in London people are so prejudiced. Here, one should never make one's début with a scandal. One should reserve that to give an {{interest}} to one's old age. I suppose they don't know your name at the theatre? If they don't, it is all right. Did anyone see you going round to her room? That is an important point." ...|$|E
60|$|Literally and mathematically invariable it is not, {{and could}} not be {{expected}} to be: because the period of a year is too short to include all the possible combinations of partial causes, while it is, at the same time, sufficiently long to make it probable that in some years at least, of every series, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> been introduced new influences of a more or less general character; such as a more vigorous or a more relaxed police; some temporary excitement from political or religious causes; or some incident generally notorious, of a nature to act morbidly on the imagination. That in spite of these unavoidable imperfections in the data, there should be so very trifling a margin of variation in the annual results, is a brilliant continuation of the general theory.|$|E
50|$|In the future, Earth-like planets may be found, as popularly {{shown in}} science fiction films of current times, which are {{habitable}} for humans and other earthlings and hence human habitats <b>there</b> <b>will</b> not <b>have</b> to be artificially created or controlled and yet human outposts {{may be able}} to flourish just like cities here on Earth.|$|R
