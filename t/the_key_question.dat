5|$|While {{there is}} an {{important}} need to link the economic, cultural, and ecological imperatives of development in the context of tourism enterprises, there is <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>question</b> of implementation and how the idea of sustainable tourism enterprises can be translated into reality: formulation of strategies and how they may be expected to interact with important aspects of indigenous culture. In addition to being locally directed and relevant, the planning process for the establishment of an ethno/ecotourism enterprise in an indigenous community should be strategic in nature. The use of a strategic planning process enables indigenous culture to be regarded as an important characteristic requiring careful consideration, rather than a feature to be exploited, or an incidental characteristic that is overshadowed by the natural features of the environment.|$|E

25|$|Product {{and process}} design can be largely {{improved}} using modern modeling, simulation and optimization techniques. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>question</b> in optimal design {{is the measure}} of what is good or desirable about a design. Before looking for optimal designs {{it is important to}} identify characteristics which contribute the most to the overall value of the design. A good design typically involves multiple criteria/objectives such as capital cost/investment, operating cost, profit, quality and/or recovery of the product, efficiency, process safety, operation time etc. Therefore, in practical applications, the performance of process and product design is often measured with respect to multiple objectives. These objectives typically are conflicting, i.e. achieving the optimal value for one objective requires some compromise on one or more of other objectives.|$|E

At this time, Mussolini said about Keynes that [...] "despite the latter's prominent position as a Liberal," [...] his work may be considered a [...] "useful introduction to fascist economics." [...] Italian Fascists also expressed great interest {{in the works of}} neoclassical economist Vilfredo Pareto. [...] Pareto had argued that democracy was an illusion and that a ruling class always emerged and enriched itself. For him, <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>question</b> was how actively the rulers ruled.

2500|$|The House of Lords (Lord Porter, Lord Normand, Lord Oaksey, Lord Reid and Lord Radcliffe) {{unanimously}} {{found that}} there was no negligence, although most considered it a close call based on whether the reasonable person would foresee this as anything more than an extremely remote risk. [...] Most of the Lords agreed that the key issue was that of making <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>question</b> one of determining the fact of what the reasonable person would have in mind regarding assumption of this risk. [...] Facts may be determined by judges, but may also be determined by lesser mortals in juries. [...] This was not considered to be a point of law, which is the province of judges. [...] In this case the risk was considered (just) too remote for the reasonable person, in spite of the observation by Lord Porter that hitting a ball out of the ground was an objective of the game, [...] "and indeed, one which the batsman would wish to bring about". The Lords believed there were policy implications in terms of the message of what liability would have meant in creating restrictions in what we can do in our everyday lives in an urbanised modern society.|$|E
2500|$|To reassert his {{economic}} agenda, {{in the spring}} of 1992, Deng made his famous southern tour of China, visiting Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai, and spending the New Year in Shanghai. He used his travels to reassert {{his economic}} policy ideas after his retirement from office. On the tour, Deng made many speeches and generated large local support for his reformist platform. He stressed the importance of economic reform in China, and criticized those who were against further reform and opening up. The tour proved that amongst the party's grassroots organizations, support for reform and opening up was firm. Because of this, more and more leading members of the central party leadership converted to Deng's position, amongst them Jiang Zemin. In his speech [...] "Deeply Understand and Implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's Important Spirit, Make Economic Construction, Reform and Opening Go Faster and Better" [...] to the Central Party School, Jiang said it did not matter if a certain mechanism was capitalist or socialist, <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>question</b> was whether it worked. Jiang's speech is notable since it introduced the term socialist market economy, which replaced Chen Yun's [...] "planned socialist market economy". In a later Politburo meeting, members voted unanimously, in old communist fashion, to continue with reform and opening up. Knowing that he had lost, Chen Yun gave in, and claimed that because of new conditions, the old techniques of the planned economy were outdated.|$|E

2500|$|The primary {{factor for}} {{classifying}} the par {{of a relatively}} straight, hazard-free hole is {{the distance from the}} tee to the green. A typical par-3 hole is less than 250 yards (225 m) in length, with a par-4 hole ranging between 251 and 475 yards (225–434 m), and a par-5 hole being longer than 475 yards (435 m). The rare par-6s can stretch well over [...] These distances are based on the typical scratch golfer's drive distance of between a green further than the average player's drive will require additional shots from the fairway. However, other considerations must be taken into account; <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>question</b> is [...] "how many strokes would a scratch golfer take to make the green by playing along the fairway?". The grade of the land from the tee to the hole might increase or decrease the carry and rolling distance of shots as measured linearly along the ground. Sharp turns or hazards may require golfers to [...] "lay up" [...] on the fairway in order to change direction or hit over the hazard with their next shot. These design considerations will affect how even a scratch golfer would play the hole, irrespective of total distance from tee to green, and must be included in a determination of par. However, a par score never includes [...] "expected" [...] penalty strokes, as a scratch player is never [...] "expected" [...] to hit a ball into a water hazard or other unplayable situation. So, the placement of hazards only affect par when considering how a scratch golfer would avoid them.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the legal}} {{developments}} in the UK, the test for apparent bias in Singapore was extensively reconsidered by the High Court in the 2005 case Tang Kin Hwa v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board. On {{the facts of the}} case, it was unnecessary for Judicial Commissioner Andrew Phang to have decided definitively whether the correct test was the reasonable suspicion or the real likelihood test. Nonetheless, he expressed the obiter view that the [...] "reasonable suspicion of bias" [...] test established in Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin and Tang Liang Hong was not significantly different from the English [...] "real likelihood of bias" [...] test (also known as [...] "real possibility of bias" [...] test). According to him, [...] "he common substance of both tests appears, in a nutshell, to be this: <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>question</b> is {{whether or not there was}} a perception on the part of a reasonable person that there would be a real likelihood of bias". The concept of [...] "likelihood" [...] entails [...] "possibility" [...] and not [...] "probability". Phang opined that this is simply another way of stating that there is a [...] "reasonable suspicion" [...] on the part of the person concerned, meaning that although the concept of [...] "reasonable suspicion" [...] is supposed to be of a less stringent standard, this standard is reflected in the concept of [...] "possibility" [...] and thus there is essentially no substantial difference in the two tests. In addition, the word real in the term real likelihood of bias cannot mean [...] "actual", as the test after all pertains to apparent bias and not actual bias.|$|E
2500|$|A person coming {{before a}} {{domestic}} tribunal has no inherent right at common law {{to be allowed}} legal representation. If a person is permitted to engage legal counsel but chooses not to, he or she cannot subsequently allege that the rules of natural justice have been breached {{because he or she}} is unable to mount an effective defence. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>question</b> is whether the individual concerned was given the opportunity to present his or her case and whether he or she suffered prejudice due to any unfairness in way the proceedings were conducted. In Ho Paul v. Singapore Medical Council (2008), the appellant, a doctor, appealed against the respondent's decision to fine and suspend him for professional misconduct. During the disciplinary proceedings against the appellant before the Council, he had not availed himself of legal counsel. One of the main issues raised was whether natural justice had been breached because the appellant had declined to cross-examine the respondent's key witness but the respondent's disciplinary committee had failed to warn him of the [...] "legal implications" [...] of this, and since the disciplinary committee had failed to ensure that the appellant appreciated the importance of making a mitigation plea. Legal commentators have rephrased the issue as whether the absence of cross-examination renders the decision unfair in all the circumstances. Judge of Appeal V.K. Rajah held that [...] "dditional duties are not foisted on a tribunal merely because the individual is unrepresented – advising a person who has been charged of his litigation strategies and options is the duty of an advocate and solicitor, not the adjudicator". Consequently, there had been no breach of the rules of natural justice as the appellant had been given the opportunity to present his case and cross-examine the witnesses, and had also been invited to make a mitigation plea.|$|E
