5|$|While Philip's fleet was {{wintering}} in Bargylia, {{the combined}} Pergamese and Rhodian fleet blockaded the harbour. The {{situation in the}} Macedonian camp became so grave that the Macedonians were close to surrendering. The dire situation was alleviated somewhat by supplies sent by Zeuxis. Philip, however, managed to get out by trickery. He sent an Egyptian deserter to Attalus and the Rhodians <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> preparing to attack the allies the next day. Upon hearing the news, Attalus and the Rhodians started preparing the fleet for the oncoming attack. While the allies were making their preparations, Philip slipped past them by night with his fleet, leaving numerous campfires burning to give the appearance that he remained in his camp.|$|E
5|$|In about 701 Bede {{wrote his}} first works, the De Arte Metrica and De Schematibus et Tropis; both were {{intended}} {{for use in the}} classroom. He continued to write {{for the rest of his}} life, eventually completing over 60 books, most of which have survived. Not all his output can be easily dated, and Bede may have worked on some texts over a period of many years. His last-surviving work is a letter to Ecgbert of York, a former student, written in 734. A 6th-century Greek and Latin manuscript of Acts of the Apostles that is believed to have been used by Bede survives and is now in the Bodleian Library at University of Oxford; it is known as the Codex Laudianus. Bede may also have worked on one of the Latin bibles that were copied at Jarrow, one of which is now held by the Laurentian Library in Florence. Bede was a teacher as well as a writer; he enjoyed music, and was said to be accomplished as a singer and as a reciter of poetry in the vernacular. It is possible that he suffered a speech impediment, but this depends on a phrase in the introduction to his verse life of Saint Cuthbert. Translations of this phrase differ, and it is uncertain whether Bede intended <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> cured of a speech problem, or merely that he was inspired by the saint's works.|$|E

25|$|It is {{sometimes}} said that Small invented the straight bat, replacing the old curved bat in the 1760s after bowlers started pitching the ball instead of skimming or trundling it.

25|$|Opposition to Clark's {{leadership}} {{began to}} grow {{after the fall of}} the PC minority government, and the party's defeat by a resurgent Liberal Party.

In his {{commentary}} work for race broadcaster Channel 9 during qualifying for the 1988 Australian Grand Prix, Stewart {{said that he had}} been asked numerous times if he was unhappy about losing his record to Prost, going on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> happy that his record had been taken by someone of the calibre of Prost as he openly believed him to be the best driver in Formula One.|$|E
25|$|Churchill {{arrived in}} Antwerp around 3pm on 3 October. He {{set up in}} the best hotel in Antwerp with Admiral Oliver (Chief of Naval Intelligence) as his secretary, and spent the {{afternoon}} touring the defences under shellfire. He wore undress Trinity House uniform. Churchill soon came to an arrangement with the Belgians that they would hold out provided the British sent substantial reinforcements. He asked for the two naval brigades, “minus recruits”. On 4 October Churchill offered to resign from the Cabinet and take personal command of the newly formed Royal Naval Division, which would incorporate the Marine and Naval Brigades. Kitchener wanted to commit an Anglo-French expeditionary force to secure Antwerp, and annotated the telegram <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> willing to appoint Churchill a temporary lieutenant-general, but Asquith thought it unwise and recorded that Churchill’s suggestion was met with a “Homeric laugh” by the Cabinet. Instead Churchill was recalled to London. The Royal Marine brigade arrived on 4 October. The 1st and 2nd Naval Brigades were then sent. They consisted largely of untrained reservists. General Rawlinson arrived on 7 October to take charge. Churchill returned to London on 7 October as something of a hero, but this changed when Antwerp fell on 10 October. Around 2,500 of Churchill’s largely untrained troops were killed, taken prisoner or interned in the neutral Netherlands.|$|E

500|$|According to Sestero and Greg Ellery, Wiseau {{came to the}} Birns and Sawyer film lot, {{rented a}} studio, and bought a [...] "complete Beginning Director package," [...] which {{included}} the purchase of two brand new film and HD cameras. Wiseau, confused {{about the differences between}} 35 mm film and high-definition video, decided to shoot the entire film in both formats simultaneously, using a custom-built apparatus that housed both cameras side-by-side and required two crews to operate. Commenting on his decision to shoot the film in this way, Wiseau said {{that he wanted to be}} able <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the first director to film an entire movie simultaneously in two formats, although ultimately only the 35mm footage was used in the final edit.|$|E

500|$|In February 1942, {{following}} {{negotiations with}} the Doyle estate, Universal Studios acquired {{the rights to the}} films and signed contracts with Rathbone and Bruce to continue their portrayals. Universal's deal—worth $300,000—was for seven years, and they purchased the rights to 21 stories in the canon in a contract that stipulated that the company had to make three films a year, of which two had to be adaptations of Doyle's stories. Universal decided to update the stories to a Second World War setting, and the first film, Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror—based on Doyle's 1917 story [...] "His Last Bow"—was updated to a Second World War setting, with Holmes attempting to capture a Nazi agent. The change of era for Holmes is explained in the opening titles, with a caption that informs viewers that Holmes is [...] "ageless, invincible and unchanging", going on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> [...] "solving significant problems of the present day".|$|E
500|$|Later that morning, Jennings' family {{heard on}} the radio that [...] "Buddy Holly and his band had been killed." [...] After calling his family, Jennings called Sky Corbin at KLLL from Fargo <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> alive. The General Artists Corporation promised to pay a {{first-class}} ticket for Jennings and the band to assist Holly's funeral in Lubbock, in exchange for them playing that night in Moorhead. After the first show, they were initially denied their payment by the venue, but after Jennings's persistence, they were paid. The flights were never paid, and Jennings and Allsup continued the tour for two more weeks, featuring Jennings as the lead singer. They were paid {{less than half of the}} original agreed salary, and upon returning to New York, Jennings put Holly's guitar and amplifier in a locker in Grand Central Terminal and mailed the keys to Maria Elena Holly. Then, he returned to Lubbock.|$|E
500|$|... 343 Guilty Spark (or Guilty Spark) (voiced by Tim Dadabo) is a robot {{character}} who {{appears in the}} original Halo trilogy. 343 Guilty Spark is an artificial intelligence designed to serve Forerunners. His identity module was sourced from a human named Chakas, who was composed by the Didact, which is <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> digitized {{at the expense of}} his biological form. Guilty Spark was fragmented into several independently operating fragments, one of which was uploaded in the familiar, floating, blue-eyed, geometric orb, first encountered in Halo: Combat Evolved, and assigned to Installation 04 (codenamed Alpha Halo) under the title of Monitor. Although an identity module is required for an artificial intelligence to operate, it may occasionally lead to complications arising from free will – for example, the containment of a Flood outbreak should always assume the highest priority for a Monitor; however, in a moment of weakness he disregarded his assigned prioritization, in favour of preserving the structural integrity of the replacement Installation.|$|E

500|$|Keats {{was exposed}} to a few sources of the Psyche myth. His {{contemporary}} sources for the myth included Lempriere's Classical Dictionary and Mary Tighe's Psyche, an 1805 work that Keats read {{as a child and}} returned to in 1818. Keats wrote to his brother George, just a few months before writing [...] "Ode to Psyche", <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> no longer delighted by Tighe's writing. Dissatisfied, he turned to Apuleius's Golden Ass, translated by William Adlington in 1566, and read through the earlier version of the Cupid and Psyche myth. After reading the work and realizing that the myth was established during the twilight of Roman mythology, Keats wrote to George: [...] "You must recollect that Psyche was not embodied as a goddess before the time of Apuleius the Platonist who lived after the Augustan age, and consequently the Goddess was never worshipped or sacrificed to with any of the ancient fervour—and perhaps never thought of in the old religion—I am more orthodox than to let a heathen Goddess be so neglected." ...|$|E
500|$|Converge {{took their}} {{music in a}} more {{progressive}} direction with Axe to Fall. Kurt Ballou noted that drummer Ben Koller had been listening to more progressive rock {{over the last few}} years, and that he tried to complement this sound on the guitar. He went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> getting the [...] "more straightforward, raw punk aggression out in a yet-to be named hardcore side project that I started. So that leaves me free to get weird and progressive with Converge." [...] Ballou considers the band's previous three albums (Jane Doe, You Fail Me and No Heroes) to be a trilogy in regards to their sound, and hoped to push their musical boundaries on Axe to Fall. The tracks on the album have been noted to range from [...] "drone-and-pummel" [...] to atmospheric. Jacob Bannon believes this album is [...] "not about being as loud and vicious as possible." [...] Feeling that 40–50 minutes of metallic hardcore can be difficult to listen to for some, Converge used softer tracks, or [...] "slow jams," [...] such as [...] "Damages" [...] and [...] "Wretched World" [...] to take the listener [...] "to some other places." ...|$|E
500|$|With the {{publication}} of [...] "Trees" [...] in the magazine Poetry in August 1913, Kilmer gained immense popularity as a poet across the United States. He had {{established himself as a}} successful lecturer—particularly one seeking to reach a Catholic audience. His close friend and editor Robert Holliday wrote that it [...] "is not an unsupported assertion <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in his time and place the laureate of the Catholic Church." [...] Trees and Other Poems (1914) was published the following year. This collection also introduced the popular poem [...] "The House With Nobody In It". Over the next few years, Kilmer was prolific in his output, managing an intense schedule of lectures, publishing a large number of essays and literary criticism, and writing poetry. [...] In 1915 he became poetry editor of Current Literature and contributing editor of Warner's Library of the World's Best Literature. In 1916 and 1917, before the American entry into World War I, Kilmer would publish four books: The Circus and Other Essays (1916), a series of interviews with literary personages entitled Literature in the Making (1917), Main Street and Other Poems (1917), and Dreams and Images: An Anthology of Catholic Poets (1917).|$|E
