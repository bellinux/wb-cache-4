40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{importance}} of the shift in use from analogue, to digital, transmission systems for radio and television signals. Put simply, analogue communications use energy waves, which can carry information signals (telephone, radio and television, satellite wireless and television, etc.). Such waves come in a number of forms, including those used for com-municating on the long, medium, and short “wave ” bands, very high fre-quency waves as used in the FM band, and the extremely high frequency waves used in analogue satellite transmissions. Many European readers will be familiar with the properties of these bands, such as the ability— when unwanted this will be described as interference—to receive stations from other European states on the medium and long wave band. Readers will also generally be aware that very high frequency broadcasts (VHF/ FM) can only be received in an area that is directly in sight of the transmit-ting towers, and that this results in much cursing when, on long-distance car journeys, signals are lost from one area and the wireless needs to be retuned. Television transmissions are similarly limited in their reception, one consequence of which is that <b>transfrontier</b> reception of <b>television</b> sig-nals has, historically, been very limited. Short wave is not generally used for intra-Europe wireless communications except by government services intent on reaching “foreign ” audiences. However, many readers will be aware of its use in long-distance communications between continents (say Australia and Europe) ...|$|R
50|$|The ACT {{was set up}} in 1989. Back then, {{there were}} fewer than 100 {{broadcasters}} in the twelve Member States of the European Community. With the occasional exception, most European countries had only ended the state monopoly of television broadcasting in the mid-1980s. Back then, the ACT had five founder members. As commercial television models proved popular with viewers, so many new channels were launched and ACT membership grew quickly. However, some of the key regulatory issues were already becoming apparent, with European rules adopted in 1989 {{for the first time on}} <b>transfrontier</b> <b>television,</b> advertising, programme quotas, and then separate rules negotiated for copyright in the early 90s.|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} manner in which France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK have implemented the provisions in 1989 Television Without Frontiers Directive for television advertising and sponsorship shows that there are obstacles {{for the development of a}} Single European Market in television advertising. Although 1989 Television Without Frontiers Directive allowed <b>transfrontier</b> <b>television</b> advertising, the regulation of television advertising remains nationally based. Furthen-nore, Member States have different levels of advertising expenditure, selling practices and television market structures. There is a tension between the provisions for television advertising and sponsorship in the Council of Europe Convention on <b>Transfrontier</b> <b>Television</b> and those in the Television Without Frontiers Directive. Member States have indicated their commitment to one text over the other in the detailed choices for their national rules. The European Court of Justice resolved some of the contradictions and ambiguities in the 1989 Television Without Frontiers Directive, and these have been reflected in the revised 1997 text. But there is still an ambiguity so as to what level of sponsor presence is adequate to ensure both transparency, and the protection of a broadcaster's editorial independence. Rules about the frequency and quantity of advertising differ between the five countries and four of them set different competitive requirements according to the type of broadcaster. There are marked differences in the rules about advertising breaks in feature films and other audiovisual works. National rules on sponsorship also vary, especially those on centre credits and the promotional mentions of the sponsor within the programme. So do the detailed provisions. National regulators decide when and what type of commercial presence constitutes surreptitious advertising. In some countries, it is only payment that renders product placement illegal, whereas in others the product has to be editorially justified and not given undue prominence. Direct offers to the public have proved to be a grey area in Member States where their economic value was high. Teleshopping is likely to become a significant source of programming, especially if Member States effectively expand their limits on airtime as allowed in the 1997 text. Although some differences have been resolved in the 1997 revision of the Television Without Frontiers Directive, there are still difficulties in establishing an effective level playing field for European television advertising...|$|E
40|$|This thesis makes a {{proposal}} for a Greek policy in the area of television broadcasting aimed at ensuring the country's ability to maintain a distinctive position in the European broadcasting market while protecting and promoting Greece's culture and language. The first part of the thesis presents the evolution of Greek legislation on television broadcasting and the status of programming content and quality from 1966, when the first television programme schedule was transmitted, until the present day. The European Community's legal framework and, in particular, the "Television Without Frontiers" Directive is analyzed since any Greek broadcasting policy has to abide by Community law. Reference is also made to the Council of Europe's Convention on <b>Transfrontier</b> <b>Television.</b> Finally, it is suggested that a Greek television broadcasting policy should focus on the formulation of different mandates for the public and private broadcasters, on the reorganization and strengthening of the public broadcaster, on the increase and funding of national cultural broadcasts and Greek language audiovisual works (as defined in the thesis), as well as on high-quality and diversified programming...|$|E
40|$|When private {{television}} {{started to}} take off in Europe in the 1980 s it confronted {{an environment in which}} the role of television and radio in cultural and national identity formation had already been established through national public service broadcasters (Gripsrud, 2007; Price, 1995). Having relied largely on publicly funded television and the film industry to produce such content, European countries lagged far behind the United States in terms of their capacity to generate content for television (Esser, 2009; Tunstall and Machin, 1999). The large private television networks and production houses in the United States were well situated to sell their content, particularly fiction and entertainment, to the new private channels in Europe. Most European countries placed requirements on their private television stations, and usually also radio, for certain amounts of domestically produced content. Their individual markets and production industries remained small compared with that of the United States, which fuelled part of the reasoning behind the EU’s Television without Frontiers Directive (TWF Directive) and the Council of Europe’s Convention on <b>Transfrontier</b> <b>Television</b> that followed. The TWF Directive, since amended and renamed the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMS Directive), aimed to break down national barriers to broadcasting and to encourage a common, larger market for television. At the same time it included quotas for European works and independent production to be achieved by stations gradually and “where practicable” (Art. 16). This non-binding formulation was based on what many countries already had in a more obligatory form at the national level...|$|E
