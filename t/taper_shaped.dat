40|$|Introduction: Ideally endotracheal tubes (ETT) should {{protect the}} airways without causing {{pressure}} induced tissue damage. Traditionally, {{the addition of}} a tracheal cuff was heralded as seal against aspiration. This type of ETT utilized a low volume high pressure cuff which caused tracheal damage such as stenosis and malacia. The next development in ETT design was the high volume low pressure cuffs intended to protect the airways while reducing tissue damage. Although reducing damage, the new cuff did not reliably protect the airways. Microaspiration still remains a serious complication of intubation. A <b>taper</b> <b>shaped</b> cuff design was recently introduced to prevent microaspiration without causing tracheal damage. Concerns were raised regarding the contact area and the resultant pressure against the tracheal wall of the <b>taper</b> <b>shaped</b> cuff. Another innovation introduced to prevent microaspiration is subglottic suction present in the tube design. Therefore, the aim {{of this paper is to}} evaluate cuff seal performance, cuff safety and intrinsic suction efficiency of current commercially available ETT. Methods: Three separate studies evaluated these areas of interest. Cuff seal performance was evaluated using an approved in vitro test fixture mimicking the human trachea. We investigated the cuff seal performance of 7 endotracheal tubes with different cuff designs and identical tracheal tube size using water as the medium. Three different size tubes from 3 different manufacturers were tested to determine subglottic suction efficiency and cuff sealing performance using the same in vitro test fixture. In a similar fixture a pressure sensitive array was mounted to compare the surface pressure of a standard barrel shaped cuff to the <b>taper</b> <b>shaped</b> cuff. The array design allowed for the pressure profile of the cuff to be mapped where it contacted the cylinder wall. In all tests the cuff pressures were maintained at 25 cm H 2 O according to manufacturer’s recommendations. Results: The sealing performance varied between the tube manufacturers with TaperGuard (TG) showing the lowest leak at. 6 g/ 5 minutes and Kimberly Clark Micro cuff (KCmc) with the highest 59. 2 g/ 5 minutes. In terms of suction efficiency Teleflex ISIS (ISIS) had the best suction performance (. 2 - 5. 3 ml/sec) at all viscosities and Portex (SACETT) (. 3 - 2. 9 ml/min) was the lowest. When comparing surface force the <b>taper</b> <b>shaped</b> cuff was less compared to the barrel shaped cuff. Conclusions: Performance in all areas tested ETTs varied considerably in terms of sealing and suction efficiency. However, the <b>taper</b> <b>shaped</b> cuff demonstrated the least surface pressure and best sealin...|$|E
40|$|Tensile {{properties}} and microhardness of electron beam welded thick damage-tolerant Ti- 6 Al- 4 V joints with the weld cross-section of parallel shaped and <b>taper</b> <b>shaped</b> configurations were examined. Moreover, the mechanical heterogeneity along the weld depth was studied. The {{results indicate that}} for both the shaped joints, the weld metal exhibits increased strength and microhardness, while decreased ductility and toughness {{as compared with the}} base metal. The mechanical properties of the weld metal are heterogeneous along the weld depth. With the increase of weld depth, the strength and microhardness increase. The weld middle position has smaller mechanical heterogeneity than the weld top and weld root. Moreover, the heterogeneity of parallel shaped welds along the weld depth is lower than that of <b>taper</b> <b>shaped</b> welds. It is also found that the change of mechanical properties such as strength and microhardness has microstructure dependent trend. The mechanical heterogeneity along the weld depth is dependent on the grain size change of β phase and martensite. © 2012 Elsevier B. V. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Background: One of the {{objectives}} of root canal preparation is to clean and shape the root canal system while maintaining the original configuration. Therefore, {{it is important to}} keep the instruments centered to provide a correct enlargement, without excessive weakening of the root structure. Aim: The aim of the study was to compare canal transportation and centering ability of K 3 (0. 02 % taper) and K 3 (0. 04 % taper) with stainless steel hand K files in primary teeth using a spiral computed tomography (SCT) scan. Materials and Methods: A total of 75 extracted mandibular primary second molars was collected. Canals were divided randomly into three groups of 25 teeth each. Group I: K 3 files (0. 02 % taper), Group II: K 3 (0. 04 % taper), and Group III: Stainless steel hand K files. Three regions from apical, mid-root, and coronal levels of the canal were recorded. All the teeth were scanned before and after instrumentation by using SCT. Results: K 3 (0. 02 % taper) showed less canal transportation and a better centering ratio than K 3 (0. 04 % taper) and stainless steel hand K files. Statistical Analysis: The mean values were compared between different study groups and the P-value was calculated by using Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA. The Mann-Whitney U-test followed by the Bonferroni correction method was employed to identify the significant groups at the 5 % level. Conclusion: K 3 (0. 02 % <b>taper)</b> <b>shaped</b> root canals without significant shaping errors when compared to K 3 (0. 04 % taper) and stainless steel hand K files in primary teeth...|$|E

40|$|A {{major source}} of {{patterning}} problems in low-k 1 lithography is line-end pullback. Though geometric metrics such as CD at gate edge have served as good indicators, the ever-rising contribution of line-end extension to layout area necessitates reducing pessimism in qualifying line-end patterning. Electrically-aware metrics for line-ends {{can be helpful in}} this regard. In this work, we calculate the Ion and Io f f impact of line-end <b>taper</b> <b>shapes</b> as well as line-end length. The proposed models are verified using TCAD simulation in a typical 65 nm process. We observe that the device threshold voltage is a weak function of line-end pullback, and that the electrical impact of the taper can vary with overlay errors. We apply a non-uniform channel length model in addition to the proposed taper-dependent threshold voltage model to calculate ∆Ion and ∆Io f f. Finally, the electrical metric for line-end printing is defined as expected change in Ion or Io f f under a given overlay error distribution. We also propose a super-ellipse form to parameterize <b>taper</b> <b>shapes,</b> and then explore a large variety of <b>taper</b> <b>shapes</b> to characterize electrical impact. 1...|$|R
