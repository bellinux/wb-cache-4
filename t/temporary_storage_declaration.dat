40|$|Today’s {{demand on}} high supply chain {{performance}} requires higher awareness about supply chain risks and uncertainty. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to analyse the role of <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> in the transport network in a supply chain perspective. The primary research question concerns the purpose or role of <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> and whether management of <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> can contribute to reducing risks and uncertainty in the supply chain. Within the described framework of supply chain systems in a transport network, and the management and control of risk and uncertainty, theoretical modelling has been used as a basis for logical deduction of the conclusions. The findings are then supported and verified by two case studies. <b>Temporary</b> <b>storage</b> in transit is located between nodes in the transport network. The <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> function will act as a supply chain disturbance neutralizer, thereby reducing risks and uncertainty within the supply chain. The use of <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> also means exposing the transport more for antagonistic threats, i. e. primarily a larger theft risk. To avoid both supply chain disturbance and increased theft risk there are three types of solutions; improved and more exact scheduling of delivery time, availability of secure parking spaces whenever a resource needs to make a temporary stop, and utilizing tracking and tracing systems. These reductive measures can be applied jointly, and as a combined toolbox they can contribute to reducing the risk and uncertainty in the supply chain. A comprehensive inventorying of appropriate methods to optimize <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> in transit has not been carried out. The deduced research results are based on theory and limited case study support and will primarily serve as a general guideline. From a security point of view, <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> offers a crime opportunity, which needs to be reduced in order to achieve lower total supply chain risk and uncertainty. This paper describes the role of <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> in a supply chain risk context and provides guidelines related to the trade-off between security concerns and supply chain efficiency. This paper illuminates the purpose and the drawbacks of temporary stops in the flow of goods within the transport network. The conditions for <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> in transit, related to controlling different types of risk and uncertainty in the supply chain, have been scarcely analyzed in previous research...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{this work}} we {{address the problem}} of {{planning}} a <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> area in a shampoo production system. Here, the production process consists of three successive steps: the making, the <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> and the packing. This <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> area consists of parallel <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> units with distinct capacities. The storage operation of a job, also called a batch, has to answer time restrictions such as release dates, due dates, family dependent setup times and time lags, and also a space constraint which is the capacity of the <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> unit. The goal is to schedule the batches on the storage units in order to minimize the total setup times and the maximum lateness. First, we model the problem on a single storage unit a two-machine flowshop with a limited buffer capacity. Next we provide three heuristics: a greedy algorithm, a hybrid heuristic based on Ant Colony Optimization and Simulated Annealing and finally a dedicated heuristic. The latter strongly exploits the structural properties shown in this paper. We provide experimental results of the evaluation on wide range instances of these heuristics. The results highlight the efficiency of the dedicated heuristic by comparison to the two others...|$|R

40|$|Scalarization is {{a process}} that {{converts}} array statements into loop nests so that they can run on a scalar machine. One technical difficulty of scalarization is that <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> often needs to be allocated in order to preserve the semantics of array syntax — “fetch before store”. Many techniques have been developed {{to reduce the size of}} <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> requirement in order to improve the memory hierarchy performance. With the emergence of short vector units on modern microprocessors, it is interesting to see how to extend the preexisting scalarization methods so that the underlying vector infrastructure is fully utilized, while at the same time keep the <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> minimized. In this paper, we extend a loop alignment algorithm for scalarization on short vector machines. The revised algorithm not only achieves vector execution with minimum <b>temporary</b> <b>storage,</b> but also handles data alignment properly, which is very important for performance. Our experiments on two types of widely available architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy...|$|R

This <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> area is composed of parallel <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> units with distinct capacities. The storage operation of a job, also called a batch, has to answer time restrictions such as release dates, due dates, restricted family dependent setup times and time lags, and also a space constraint which is the capacity of the <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> unit. The goal is to schedule the batches on the storage units in order to minimize the total setup times and the maximum lateness. First, we model the problem on a single storage unit as a two-machine flowshop problem with a limited buffer capacity and we show that it is NP-hard. We also show that the particular case in which no lateness is allowed is solvable in polynomial time under special conditions on the buffer capacity, both for single or parallel <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> units. Next we provide three heuristics: a greedy algorithm, a hybrid heuristic based on Ant Colony Optimization and Simulated Annealing and finally a dedicated heuristic. The latter strongly exploits the structural properties shown in this paper.

In response to this mandate, many States and compact regions have made substantial progress toward establishing new disposal capacity for these wastes. While this progress is noteworthy, many circumstances can adversely affect States` abilities to meet the 1993 deadline, and many States have indicated that they are considering other waste management options {{in order to fulfill}} their responsibilities beyond 1992. Among the options that States are considering for the interim management of low- level radioactive waste is <b>temporary</b> <b>storage.</b> <b>Temporary</b> <b>storage</b> may be either short term or long term and may be at a centralized <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> facility provided by the State or a contractor, or may be at the point of generation or collection.
