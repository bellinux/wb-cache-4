5|$|The {{interior}} of the church has nineteen stained glass windows, three behind <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> and eight along {{each side of the}} church building. The windows behind <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> focus on St. Joseph and depict, from right to left, the sojourn of the Holy Family in Egypt; the daily lives of the Holy Family; and the death of Joseph. Four of the sixteen windows {{on the sides of the}} church (those closest to <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> and those closest to the doors) depict lilies. The remaining twelve windows each depict a single saint, including Ignatius of Loyola, Stanislaus Kostka, and Saint Cecilia. Further ornamentation of the walls includes carvings depicting the fourteen Stations of the Cross as well as twelve triforiums holding paintings illustrating the Lord's Prayer, the Bread of Life Discourse, and praise to Christ and Mary. On top of <b>the</b> <b>altar,</b> at the eastern end of the church, is a tabernacle. <b>The</b> <b>altar,</b> imported from Germany in 1880, is decorated with statues of Abraham, Peter, Paul, and Melchizedek.|$|E

5|$|Altar 4 is a {{circular}} monument. It {{was also found}} {{in the northern part of}} the East Plaza and was associated with Stela 4. It depicts three seated prisoners, the central figure is facing to the left while the other two are facing inwards towards him. Hieroglyphic texts are carved underneath the prisoners and upon the sides of <b>the</b> <b>altar.</b> <b>The</b> <b>altar</b> has been dated on stylistic grounds to the latter part of the 8th century AD.|$|E

50|$|A {{big part}} of the {{furniture}} comes from the renowned Atelier J.W. Ramakers & Sons sculptors from Geleen, Holland. Ramakers delivered in 1928 the timpan, both <b>the</b> side <b>altars,</b> <b>the</b> St. Joseph <b>altar</b> in 1905 and <b>the</b> Maria <b>altar</b> in 1928, in 1929 the pulpit.

50|$|<b>The</b> left <b>altar</b> has a {{painting}} by Michelangelo Cerruti, depicting The Sacred Heart adored by the Saints John Nepomuk and Louis Gonzaga (1730s). Cerruti was commissioned by the Jesuits to complete paintings for all <b>the</b> <b>altars.</b> These included <b>the</b> Virgin appears to San Macuto for <b>the</b> main <b>altar,</b> and a Glory of St Joseph for <b>the</b> right <b>altar.</b> <b>The</b> San Macuto painting depicts the church of San Macuto {{and the city of}} Saint Malo. Previously the church had paintings by Girolamo Muziano, Giuseppe Peruzzini, and Durante Alberti.|$|R
50|$|Excavations {{beginning}} in 2011 have thrown more light on <b>the</b> <b>altars.</b> <b>The</b> archaeologists included Ian Haynes of Newcastle University and Tony Wilmott (who won the Archaeologist of the Year award in 2012).

Behind <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> is Bernard van Orley's The Carrying of the Cross — a companion-piece to this {{painting}} is in the National Gallery of Scotland. The organ case dates from 1716; originally designed by Christopher Schreider for St Mary Abbots Church, Kensington, it was acquired by Oriel in 1884.|$|E
5|$|To Cairano, also, is {{attributed}} <b>the</b> <b>Altar</b> of San Girolamo {{in the church}} of St Francis. One of the critical issues of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia {{is the lack of}} historical sources on its origin. Certainly <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> was carved after 1506, given its high quality and artistic originality, indeed the highest level of art in the Brescian period, and evokes several features of Cairano's earlier work on the Loggia and front-yard of San Pietro's church in Oliveto.|$|E
50|$|The four niches of the {{interior}} of the pylons of the dome have statues of Blessed Alessandro Sauli and St Sebastian (1668), (right) by Pierre Puget; and on the left, St Bartholomew (1695), by Claude David and St John the Baptist by Filippo Parodi. Along the walls, the statues of apostles and doctors of the church were completed by 1740 by Francesco Schiaffino. <b>The</b> <b>altars</b> along <b>the</b> right nave include paintings of St Peter Healing the Lame (1694-1696) at <b>the</b> first <b>altar</b> by Domenico Piola; Martyrdom di San Biagio, (1680) at <b>the</b> second <b>altar</b> by Carlo Baratta;Resurrection of Christ, lateral to 2nd altar by Aurelio Lomi e Annunciation by Ottavio Semino;Virgin with Saints Domenic and Rosa at <b>the</b> third <b>altar</b> by Paolo Gerolamo Piola; Viaticum of St. Magdalene at <b>the</b> fourth <b>altar</b> by Francesco Vanni. <b>The</b> <b>altars</b> along <b>the</b> left nave include paintings of Blessed Alessandro Sauli Stops the Plague, (c. 1630) at <b>the</b> fifth <b>altar</b> by Domenico Fiasella; Pietà, (c. 1571) at <b>the</b> sixth <b>altar</b> by Luca Cambiaso;Last Judgement, lateral to sixth altar by Aurelio Lomi and Vision of St Domenic by Domenico Fiasella; Madonna with Saints Charles Borromeo and Francis of Assisi, (c. 1620) at <b>the</b> seventh <b>altar</b> by Giulio Cesare Procaccini; andSt Francis of Assisi receives stigmata, at <b>the</b> eighth <b>altar</b> by Guercino.|$|R

5|$|Altar 12 is {{carved in}} the early Maya style and archaeologists {{consider}} {{it to be an}} especially early example dating to {{the first part of the}} Late Preclassic. Because of the carvings on the upper face of <b>the</b> <b>altar,</b> it is supposed that the monument was originally erected as a vertical stela in the Late Preclassic, and was reused as a horizontal altar in the Classic. At this time 16 hieroglyphs were carved around the outer rim of <b>the</b> <b>altar.</b> The carving on the upper face of <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> represents a standing human figure portrayed in profile, facing left. The figure is flanked by two vertical series of four glyphs. A smaller profile figure is depicted facing the first figure, separated from it by one of the series of glyphs. The central figure is depicted standing upon a horizontal band representing the earth, the band is flanked by two earth monsters. Above the figure is a celestial band with part of the head of a sacred bird visible in the centre. The 16 glyphs on the rim of the monument are formed by anthropomorphic figures mixed with other elements.|$|E
5|$|Altar 19 {{was buried}} in the fill of the final version of Temple 33, {{immediately}} in front of the second version of the summit shrine. It was badly damaged and was broken into several pieces, and the majority of a sculpture depicting a seated person was chipped away. The three fragments were buried together in a way that paired <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> with the buried Stela 31; this may have maintained a relationship between the monuments that existed when they were originally on public display. <b>The</b> <b>altar</b> was crafted from limestone and is now in the site museum at Tikal. It has been dated to approximately AD 445.|$|E
5|$|Before the Protestant Reformation, the {{crucifix}} was common in Western Christianity. It {{is a model}} of the cross with Jesus crucified on it.

5|$|On {{the left}} side of <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> are also two retablos. The larger altar, which is a twin of <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> {{opposite}} it, houses an image of a unidentified saint on the topmost level, presumably Michael the Archangel, and the crucified Christ (originally Madonna and Child) in the center, Saint Anthony of Padua on the middle-left, and Saint Nicholas of Tolentino on the middle-right niches. The original images on the lowest level have been replaced. The smaller retablo, also of the same style, houses the images of Saint Joseph with the child Jesus, and St Isidore the Laborer on the lower and upper level, respectively. In the sacristy is another retablo, with a crucifix in its central niche. On the doorframes of the sacristy are two bas-reliefs depicting Saint Ignatius and the first Jesuits before Mary and the child Jesus and of St. Ignatius holding a book (in stucco).|$|E
5|$|Ramona, {{published}} in 1884, {{was based in}} part on experiences that Helen Hunt Jackson had had during her visit to Rancho Camulos in 1882. Jackson spent only two hours on the ranch and did not meet Ysabel del Valle, but she had a keen eye for details and used many of her observations in the novel. For example, <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> cloth in the rancho's chapel had a small tear in it which had been mended. In the novel, the character Margarita accidentally tears <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> cloth, and Ramona sews it back together. The book became extremely popular and inspired a great deal of tourism, which was stimulated by the improved access possible due to the opening of Southern Pacific railroad lines in Southern California.|$|E
