5|$|In a {{significant}} departure from conventional practice, <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> {{not based on}} a bottom time defined as time of leaving the surface to time leaving the bottom, but on time to reach a depth of 6m during the ascent.|$|E
5|$|On their arrival, Southern, Dempsey and Kenyon use a ray gun {{to neutralise}} the store's robot guards and bypass the {{security}} doors {{one after the}} other, ultimately arriving in the plutonium vault. Southern reveals his true identity and holds the others at gunpoint, commanding them to proceed to the Leader's proposed rendezvous point and capture him. <b>The</b> <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> turned, however, when a robot traps Southern in a crushing grip. Dempsey and Kenyon unlock the bracelets and make a getaway, jamming the security doors and leaving Southern {{to die in the}} nuclear explosion.|$|E
5000|$|It {{can now be}} {{made clear}} why the payment for an {{insertion}} is 3. 1 pays for the first insertion of the element, 1 pays for moving the element the next time <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>is</b> expanded, and 1 pays for moving an older element the next time <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>is</b> expanded. Intuitively, this explains why an element's contribution never [...] "runs out" [...] regardless of how many times <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>is</b> expanded: since <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>is</b> always doubled, <b>the</b> newest half always covers the cost of moving the oldest half.|$|R
50|$|For {{the direct}} product <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> same {{except that the}} first digits of {{the bottom half of}} <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> same as in the top half.|$|R

5|$|When {{you throw}} a {{cat in the}} oven, it's easy to have someone in the {{orchestra}} slam a hammer down on an anvil, scaring {{the hell out of}} everyone. The hard part is manipulating the story and accenting the characters. In the beginning, when Todd is laying down the rules, there's a certain repetitive thematic idea you hear. You hear the same music when Dussander is turning the tables on Todd, which makes you remember the first scene... You hope people are subliminally making the connection that <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> turning back and forth.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} tables {{list the}} top 10 scorers in each division including goals scored {{in both the}} regular and post season events. Note there is no award presented for these season-encompassing scoring feats, <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> for statistical purposes only. Scoring awards were bestowed per stage, with the primary award that which was presented in the Superfinal.|$|E
25|$|In addition, it {{has been}} argued that Titania in William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night’s Dream (1600) is an {{inversion}} of Circe. Titania (daughter of the Titans) was a title by which the sorceress was known in Classical times. In this case <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> turned on the character, who is queen of the fairies. She is made to love an ass after, rather than before, he is transformed into his true animal likeness.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Table</b> <b>was</b> {{produced}} by <b>the</b> Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission who produced {{a report on}} it. A version of <b>the</b> <b>Table</b> <b>is</b> now published on the website Legislation.gov.uk.|$|R
50|$|Because {{all three}} {{attributes}} are prime attributes (i.e. belong to candidate keys), <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>is</b> in 3NF. <b>The</b> <b>table</b> <b>is</b> not in BCNF, however, as the Shop Type attribute is functionally {{dependent on a}} non-superkey: Nearest Shop.|$|R

25|$|Students usually sit at tables, not desks (usually two at one table), {{sometimes}} {{arranged in}} a semicircle or another geometric or functional shape. During exams in classrooms, <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> sometimes arranged in columns with one pupil per table (if permitted by the room's capacities) {{in order to prevent}} cheating; at many schools, this is only the case for some exams in the two final years of school, i.e. some of the exams counting for the final grade on the high school diploma.|$|E
25|$|Some {{spaces of}} <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> not filled, {{but this does}} not mean that there are no words which would fit. The sounds a, e (end-firm when stressed) and i, u (short) can not be start-firm and {{consequently}} the word having them in the next-to-last stressed syllable can not be of the first and the third accentuation pattern. Some of the declensional types include few words, for example there are only two words of the third accentuation pattern in the fifth declension: sūnùs and lietùs. The number of words (Dictionary of contemporary Lithuanian language / Dabartinės Lietuvių kalbos žodynas; the fourth issue, 2000) of the declensional patterns can be checked in the section above.|$|E
25|$|Tepui names {{shown in}} <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> {{those used in}} Flora of the Venezuelan Guayana and Sarraceniaceae of South America, with {{alternate}} names and spellings given in brackets. Many additional orthographic variants are likely to exist and some localities remain the subject of considerable toponymic confusion; these cases are covered in the Notes section. Many of the tepui heights are approximate and likely to change as more accurate measurements become available. Only tepuis known to support Heliamphora {{are included in the}} tables (for example, not all parts of the Chimantá Massif or Eastern Tepuis chain are listed). Formally described species are listed first, followed by undescribed species, and finally natural hybrids. Where published information is available, the altitudinal distribution of a taxon at a particular locality is given. In cases of unconfirmed locality records, the taxon name is preceded by a question mark (?).|$|E

25|$|The pen {{and paper}} on <b>the</b> <b>table</b> signify <b>the</b> rule of law. <b>The</b> <b>table's</b> leg <b>is</b> shaped like a fasces, an ancient Roman symbol of power and {{authority}} (imperium). On the far left of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>is</b> a silver inkwell, emblazed with George Washington's coat of arms (see Syng inkstand). A white quill rests upon silver dogs, ancient symbols of loyalty. Behind <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>is</b> a large black hat.|$|R

500|$|According to Cable, each {{table is}} named after a {{different}} composer and has a [...] "pseudo elegant" [...] decor. Some of <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> [...] "haunted" [...] (animated), at times rotating or vibrating; one rises [...] every 45 minutes, returning to its original position after moving through a succession of different heights. The table named for Sergei Rachmaninoff shakes when a button in the kitchen is pressed, and the Stephen Sondheim table disappears completely through a slit in the wall. Couches are also available for lounging. The upstairs unisex bathroom has an [...] "under-the-sea" [...] theme and reportedly [...] "regularly induces screams".|$|E

500|$|The Promenade was {{refurbished}} in 1990 by Leslie Wright with a gilded {{ceiling and}} reliefs and brass lanterns, and was altered again in 2005 by Thierry Despont, who fitted {{it with an}} oval leather bar; it forms the grand entrance and has a length which is {{equal to that of}} Nelson's Column. Piano music is played throughout much of the day, with live jazz from 19:30. Afternoon tea, a tradition which has taken place at the hotel since its opening in 1931, is served {{every day of the week}} at five in the afternoon in the large Promenade and the Spatisserie, with guests seated in decorative upholstered sofas with low tables placed in front of them. <b>The</b> <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> set with elegant silver cutlery and crockery, with Corinthian columns made of marble, glittering chandeliers, French tapestries and potted plants in the background. Tea is served by waiters dressed in English-style long coats. Hollywood actor Charlton Heston, a frequent guest at the hotel, once commented on the aspect of service at the hotel: “The cooks and bakers, the clerks and porters, the maids and the flower ladies, the bell men are the hotel”.|$|E
500|$|Einstein's {{scientific}} publications {{are listed}} below in four tables: journal articles, book chapters, books and authorized translations. [...] Each publication is {{indexed in the}} first column by its number in the Schilpp bibliography (Albert Einstein: Philosopher–Scientist, pp.694–730) and by its article number in Einstein's Collected Papers. [...] Complete references for these two bibliographies may be found below in the Bibliography section. [...] The Schilpp numbers are used for cross-referencing in the Notes (the final column of each table), since they cover a greater time period of Einstein's life at present. [...] The English translations of titles are generally taken from the published volumes of the Collected Papers. [...] For some publications, however, such official translations are not available; unofficial translations are indicated with a § superscript. Although <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> presented in chronological order by default, each table can be re-arranged in alphabetical order for any column by the reader clicking on the arrows {{at the top of}} that column. [...] For illustration, to re-order a table by subject—e.g., to group together articles that pertain to [...] "General relativity" [...] or [...] "Specific heats"—one need only click on the arrows in the [...] "Classification and Notes" [...] columns. [...] To print out the re-sorted table, one may print it directly by using the web-browser Print option; the [...] "Printable version" [...] link at the left gives only the default sorting. [...] Collaborative works by Einstein are highlighted in lavender, with the co-author(s) provided in the final column of the table.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} tables summarize {{every possible}} historical spelling for the syllables which were spelled differently under the historical system.
