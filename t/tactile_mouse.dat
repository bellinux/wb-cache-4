40|$|Abstract- Since our <b>tactile</b> <b>mouse</b> can {{generate}} not only distributed pressure but also slippage force, {{it is expected}} that it can enhance the reality degree of virtual reality generated by it compared to conventional tactile displays. In previous works, this <b>tactile</b> <b>mouse</b> was effective for edge tracing of virtual figures. However, advanced tests are required using psychophysical experiments to evaluate this tactile display. In this paper, four virtual relief-like figures, a triangle, square, pentagon and circle, are presented using the <b>tactile</b> <b>mouse.</b> These virtual figures have a constant height of around 1 mm against the background. To evaluate the effectiveness of combined presentation of pressure and slippage, not only pressure but also tangential force is generated on the tactile pad on which an operator puts his finger in combined presentation tests when the mouse cursor travels on the figure. In a series of experiments, five male subjects judge which figure is presented. It is found that the percentage of correct answers is increased in the combined presentation when the circle and pentagon are presented. Therefore, the combined presentation provides plain virtual sensation to allow the operator to more easily understand the sensation...|$|E

40|$|The {{world around}} us is replete with stimuli that unfold over time. When we hear an {{auditory}} stream like music or speech or scan a texture with our fingertip, physical features in the stimulus are concatenated in a particular order. This temporal patterning is critical to interpreting the stimulus. To explore the capacity of mice and humans to learn tactile sequences, we developed a task in which subjects had to recognise a continuous modulated noise sequence delivered to whiskers or fingertips, defined by its temporal patterning over hundreds of milliseconds. GO and NO-GO sequences differed only in that the order of their constituent noise modulation segments was temporally scrambled. Both mice and humans efficiently learned <b>tactile</b> sequences. <b>Mouse</b> sequence recognition depended on detecting transitions in noise amplitude; animals could base their decision on the earliest information available.

40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} {{the effect of}} chondroitin sulfate (CS), a compound used {{in the treatment of}} osteoarthritis and joint pain, on the formalin-induced <b>tactile</b> allodynia in <b>mice.</b> A repeated oral administration of CS (300  mg/kg, b. i. d.) significantly ameliorated the formalin-induced tactile allodynia from day 10 after formalin injection. On day 14, the phosphorylation of spinal p 38 MAPK and subsequent increase in c-Fos-immunoreactive dorsal lumbar neurons were attenuated by the repeated administration of CS. These findings suggest that CS attenuates formalin-induced tactile allodynia through the inhibition of p 38 MAPK phosphorylation and subsequent up-regulation of c-Fos expression in the dorsal lumbar spinal cord...|$|R

30|$|The ideal {{surgical}} simulator should {{satisfy the}} following three conditions. First, it should reflect patient-specific anatomical information that is input into the simulator. Second, it should allow interactive control. Third, the user interface should be intuitive. Currently, some computer simulators are available for surgical training, but most have limited, pre-programmed scenarios [1],[4],[6]. In liver surgery, {{the use of an}} image processing workstation allows one to calculate resection volume and visualize completion images [16],[17]. However, this existing system is not interactive, so the steps of the operation cannot be simulated. This general-purpose software can be applied easily to various organs and simulate the procedure in a step-by-step fashion.

A computer simulation system may greatly assist surgeons to preoperatively evaluate an operation and facilitate sharing of information among the operative staff. However, there are several problems with existing simulation systems. We have developed a new surgical simulation system using a patient’s own imaging data, which has some advantages over existing systems. Individual anatomical information obtained through an imaging study is used in this system. In addition it allows interactive control, similar to what a surgeon does in a real operation. Furthermore, a surgeon can control the system intuitively using a three dimensional <b>tactile</b> <b>mouse.</b> Changing the translucency of objects {{makes it easy to}} understand complex anatomical relationships. In conclusion, this new system is a patient-specific surgical simulator and can be applied to navigation surgery, medical education and patient communication.|$|E

40|$|Sensing {{force is}} crucial to {{maintain}} the viability of all living cells. Despite its fundamental importance, how force is sensed {{at the molecular level}} remains largely unknown. Here we show that stomatin-like protein- 3 (STOML 3) controls membrane mechanics by binding cholesterol and thus facilitates force transfer and tunes the sensitivity of mechano-gated channels, including Piezo channels. STOML 3 is detected in cholesterol-rich lipid rafts. In mouse sensory neurons, depletion of cholesterol and deficiency of STOML 3 similarly and interdependently attenuate mechanosensitivity while modulating membrane mechanics. In heterologous systems, intact STOML 3 is required to maintain membrane mechanics to sensitize Piezo 1 and Piezo 2 channels. In C 57 BL/ 6 N, but not STOML 3 / <b>mice,</b> <b>tactile</b> allodynia is attenuated by cholesterol depletion, suggesting that membrane stiffening by STOML 3 is essential for mechanical sensitivity.

40|$|Sensory {{hypersensitivity}} is {{a common}} symptom in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), including Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), and frequently leads to <b>tactile</b> defensiveness. In <b>mouse</b> models of ASDs, there is mounting evidence of neuronal and circuit hyperexcitability in several brain regions, which could contribute to sensory hypersensitivity. However, {{it is not yet}} known whether or how sensory stimulation might trigger abnormal sensory processing at the circuit level or abnormal behavioral responses in ASD mouse models, especially during an early developmental time when experience-dependent plasticity shapes such circuits. Using a novel assay, we discovered exaggerated motor responses to whisker stimulation in young Fmr 1 knockout (KO) mice (postnatal days (P) 14 - 16), a model of FXS. Adult Fmr 1 KO mice actively avoided a stimulus that was innocuous to wild-type controls, a sign of tactile defensiveness. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging of Layer 2 / 3 barrel cortex neurons expressing GCaMP 6 s, we found no differences between wild-type and Fmr 1 KO mice in overall whisker-evoked activity, though 45 % fewer neurons in young Fmr 1 KO mice responded in a time-locked manner. Notably, we identified a pronounced deficit in neuronal adaptation to repetitive whisker stimulation in both young and adult Fmr 1 KO mice. Thus, impaired adaptation in cortical sensory circuits is a potential cause of tactile defensiveness in autism...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is entirely}} dedicated to people having {{some degree of}} combined impairments of both the visual and the auditory channels and, specifically, to deafblind people. As such individuals are deaf and blind at the same time, they {{are not able to}} rely on their sight or on their sense of hearing to communicate with others and to interact with the external world. As a result, they are forced to utilize an alternative channel for achieving communication, interaction and access to information. Among the residual channels, the sense of touch is the best sensory substitute: although it is less performing than vision and hearing, it enables exchanging messages with the environment. Nevertheless, in order to be accessed for exchanging messages (communication) or for acquiring information, people and objects have to be at contact distance. This major drawback can be mitigated by introducing assistive technology (AT) in the form of novel human-computer interfaces that enable individuals to go beyond close proximity and to interact with a world that is, day after day, one step forward. In {{the first part of this}} dissertation, we provide an overview of touch-based communication systems, and we identify their major features, and we introduce a meta-language that enables the description of both the static and the dynamic features of touch-based communication systems, in order to enable systems to easily move from one language to another.

40|$|Abstract Background Several {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the involvement of nitric oxide (NO) in acute and chronic pain using mice lacking a single NO synthase (NOS) gene among the three isoforms: neuronal (nNOS), inducible (iNOS) and endothelial (eNOS). However, the precise role of NOS/NO in pain states remains to be determined owing to the substantial compensatory interactions among the NOS isoforms. Therefore, in this study, we used mice lacking all three NOS genes (n/i/eNOS -/- mice) and investigated the behavioral phenotypes {{in a series of}} acute and chronic pain assays. Results In a model of tissue injury-induced pain, evoked by intraplantar injection of formalin, both iNOS -/- and n/i/eNOS -/- mice exhibited attenuations of pain behaviors in the second phase compared with that in wild-type mice. In a model of neuropathic pain, nerve injury-induced behavioral and cellular responses (tactile allodynia, spinal microglial activation and Src-family kinase phosphorylation) were reduced in n/i/eNOS -/- but not iNOS -/- <b>mice.</b> <b>Tactile</b> allodynia after nerve injury was improved by acute pharmacological inhibition of all NOSs and nNOS. Furthermore, in MG- 5 cells (a microglial cell-line), interferon-γ enhanced NOSs and Mac- 1 mRNA expression, and the Mac- 1 mRNA increase was suppressed by L-NAME co-treatment. Conversely, the NO donor, sodium nitroprusside, markedly increased mRNA expression of Mac- 1, interleukin- 6, toll-like receptor 4 and P 2 X 4 receptor. Conclusions Our results provide evidence that the NOS/NO pathway contributes to behavioral pain responses evoked by tissue injury and nerve injury. In particular, nNOS may be important for spinal microglial activation and tactile allodynia after nerve injury. </p...|$|R
40|$|Fear-conditioning {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{paradigms}} in attempts to unravel the processes and mechanisms underlying learning and plasticity. In most Pavlovian conditioning paradigms an auditory stimulus is used as the conditioned stimulus (CS), but conditioning to a tactile CS can also be accomplished. The whisker-to-barrel <b>tactile</b> system in <b>mice</b> offers a convenient way to investigate the brain pathways and mechanisms of learning and plasticity of the cerebral cortex. To support the claim that an animal learns during conditioning sessions and that the resulting plastic changes are associative in nature, objective measures of behavior are necessary. Multiple types of conditioned responses can develop depending on the training situation, CS and unconditioned stimulus (UCS) characteristics. These include physiological responses such as salivation, heart rate, and galvanic skin reaction, and also behavioral responses such as startle reflex potentiation or suppression of an ongoing behavior. When studying learning with the whisker system in behaving mice, stimulation of individual whiskers in a well-controlled manner may require animal restraint, which has the disadvantage of limiting the observation of potential behavioral responses. Stimulation of whiskers in a neck-restraining apparatus evokes head movements. When whisker stimulation (CS) is paired with an aversive UCS during conditioning, the number of head movements decrease in the course of the training. This reaction, called minifreezing, resembles the frequently used behavioral measure known as the freezing response. However, this is only applicable for freely moving animals. This article will review experimental evidence confirming that minifreezing is a relevant index of association formation between the neutral CS and aversive UCS...|$|R
40|$|Neuronal {{nitric oxide}} (NO) plays an {{important}} role in gastric motor activity and modulates the mechanosensitivity of gastro-oesophageal vagal afferents. Effects of NO on food intake are dependent on feeding status. We sought to determine the effect of NO on gastro-oesophageal vagal afferent activity in the normally fed and food-restricted states and the second messenger pathways mediating these effects. Eight week old female C 56 BL/ 6 mice were fed ad libitum or food restricted for 14  h. An in vitro preparation was used to determine the functional effects of NO and the second messenger pathways involved. Expression of NO signal transduction molecules in vagal afferents was determined by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Endogenous NO and the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) inhibited vagal mucosal afferent responses to <b>tactile</b> stimuli in <b>mice</b> fed ad libitum. After a 14  h fast endogenous NO and SNAP potentiated tension and mucosal afferent responses to mechanical stimulation. The excitatory effect of NO was blocked by the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitor apocynin. After a 14  h fast expression of NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX 2) mRNA in whole nodose ganglia was significantly reduced and the excitatory effect of NO on gastro-oesophageal vagal afferents was lost. Under fasting conditions the inhibitory effect of NO was blocked with the hyperpolarisation-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel blocker ivabradine and mRNA expression of HCN 3 in the nodose ganglia was elevated. In conclusion, the role of NO in the peripheral modulation of gastro-oesophageal vagal afferents is dynamic and dependent on feeding status. Stephen J. Kentish, Tracey A. O'Donnell, Gary A.

40|$|AbstractThe (+) -isomer of {{indeloxazine}} AS 1069562 exerts multiple pharmacological actions {{including the}} inhibition of serotonin (5 -HT) and norepinephrine reuptake and analgesia in experimental animal pain models. Here, we evaluated the antinociceptive effects of AS 1069562 and the antidepressants duloxetine and amitriptyline in mouse models of prostaglandin-induced spinal hypersensitivity. Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) and F 2 α (PGF 2 α) were intrathecally administered to induce spinal hypersensitivity, causing <b>tactile</b> allodynia in <b>mice.</b> Allodynia induced by PGF 2 α {{but not by}} PGE 2 was suppressed by desensitization of C-fibers with systemic pretreatment with resiniferatoxin. C-fiber hyperexcitability might therefore {{play a role in}} allodynia induced by PGF 2 α but not PGE 2. In the PGE 2 -induced allodynia model, AS 1069562 and duloxetine significantly suppressed allodynia, whereas amitriptyline did not. In the PGF 2 α-induced allodynia model, AS 1069562 and amitriptyline significantly ameliorated allodynia, whereas duloxetine did not. To demonstrate the broad effects of AS 1069562 compared to duloxetine, additional studies were conducted to elucidate other target mechanisms of AS 1069562 beyond 5 -HT and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition. AS 1069562 exhibited affinity for both 5 -HT 1 A and 5 -HT 3 receptors, and the analgesic effect of AS 1069562 on PGF 2 α-induced allodynia was significantly blocked by the 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist (S) –WAY 100135 and the 5 -HT 3 receptor agonist SR 57227. Taken together, these results indicate that AS 1069562 inhibits both C-fiber- and non-C-fiber-dependent prostaglandin-induced allodynia, while duloxetine inhibits only non-C-fiber-triggered allodynia, and amitriptyline inhibits only C-fiber-triggered allodynia. These broad antinociceptive effects of AS 1069562 may be due not only to 5 -HT and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition but also to its effects on 5 -HT receptors such as 5 -HT 1 A and 5 -HT 3 receptors...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{evaluate}} {{the performance and}} usability of mouse-based, touch-based, and tangible interaction for manipulating objects in a 3 D virtual environment. This comparison is a step toward {{a better understanding of}} the limitations and benefits of these existing interaction techniques, with the ultimate goal of facilitating an easy transition between the different 3 D data exploration environments. For this purpose we analyze partic-ipants' performance in 3 D manipulation using a docking task. We measured completion times, docking accuracy, as well as subjective criteria such as fatigue, workload, and preference. Our results show that the three input modalities provide similar levels of precision but require different completion times. We also discuss our qualitative observations as well as people's preferences and put our findings into context of the application domain of 3 D data analysis environments. Many application domains rely on effective, efficient, and intuitive means of interacting with 3 D data [37, 48]. Traditionally, this interaction has often relied on mouse and keyboard inputs. Recent developments of interaction technology, however, have led to new input modalities becoming available, in particular tactile input [30, 61, 74] 1 and tangible interaction [31, 59]. 2 Several researchers have thus started to explore their use for interaction with 3 D data. Nevertheless, the three input modalities—mouse, touch, and tangibles—are not identical in characteristics such as their capabilities or usability: their advantages and disadvantages depend on the the interaction goal and the given application domain. For example, while one may use a tangible input device intuitively in a game, scientific visualization applications may require a level of accuracy that 1 I. e., interfaces based on finger or pen input on display surfaces. 2 I. e., interfaces that follow Ullmer & Ishii's [68] four characteristics. one could expect to better be provided by touch-based or in particular mouse-based input. Tangibles are often regarded as the best way to interact with 3 D data. We question this assumption here with our study that measured several usability factors: participants' accuracy (i. e., rotational difference and Euclidean distance), their perceived fatigue levels, and their perceived workload. We also took into account participants' preferences and their general feedback for each technique. The study consisted of 15 abstract 3 D docking tasks—bringing an abstract virtual object to a given target orientation and position—for each of the three modalities. Our study confirmed that <b>mouse,</b> <b>tactile,</b> and tangible input are all valid means to control 3 D manipulations. Much to our surprise, however, we found that all three input modalities allow users to achieve the same level of accuracy. Differences only arose with respect to task completion times and preferences. Qualitative observations of the participants during the study provided additional insights on what users tend to do when facing a docking task with these three input techniques which we discuss in detail below. In summary, we contribute (1) an in-depth analysis of people's understanding and use of mouse-based, tactile, and tangible input for 3 D interaction, (2) a study design that compares the three modalities, and (3) in-depth qualitative observations and people's preferences in the context of 3 D data analysis environments. We thus shed light on the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques and serves as a basis for their further development and evaluation, in particular for 3 D visualization...|$|R
