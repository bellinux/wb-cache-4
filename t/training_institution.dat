40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop and empirically test a {{hypothetical}} model of factors impacting performance of <b>training</b> <b>institutions</b> in Uganda in order to establish their statistical significance. The liberalisation of the education sector in Uganda, which has led to the rapid growth in the establishment of private sector higher education institutions in the country, now necessitates empirical and theoretical research into the factors impacting performance of these <b>training</b> <b>institutions.</b> The mission of higher education <b>training</b> <b>institutions</b> is to constantly create a critical academic community to debate national issues and to generate relevant knowledge for the country’s economic growth and development. The study investigated and analysed how the independent variables (individual-, institutional- and external) impact institutional performance (dependent variable). The study reviewed literature in the areas of individual-, institutional- and external factors supported by Wei’s (2006), Mackenzie-Phillips (2008), Burke-Litwin (1994), Lusthaus, Adrien, Anderson and Carden (1999) and The Jain (2005) models as presented in section 6 of chapter one. The hypothetical model developed was based on the models mentioned. The study sought the perceptions of managers and utilised the quantitative research paradigm. A survey was conducted using a self-administered questionnaire distributed to managers in both public and private <b>training</b> <b>institutions</b> in Uganda. The final sample comprised 488 respondents. Data was collected in 2012 over a period of four months. The returned questionnaires were subjected to several statistical analyses. The validity of the measuring instrument was ascertained using exploratory factor analysis. The Cronbach’s alpha values for reliability were calculated for each of the factors identified during the exploratory factor analysis. In this study, correlation and exploratory factor analysis, the KMO measure of sample adequacy and Bartlett’s test of sphericity and regressions were the main statistical procedures used to test the appropriateness of data, correlation and significance of the relationships hypothesised between the various independent and dependent variables. The study identified nine independent variables as significantly impacting the performance (dependent variable) of <b>training</b> <b>institutions</b> in Uganda. Three statistical significant relationships were found between the individual factors: knowledge acquisition, role identity, employee empowerment and performance of <b>training</b> <b>institutions</b> in Uganda. Four statistical significant relationships were found between the institutional factors: strategic intent, management capabilities, organisational resources, organisational culture and performance of <b>training</b> <b>institutions</b> in Uganda. Two statistical significant relationships were found between the external factors: political/legal, stakeholders and performance of <b>training</b> <b>institutions</b> in Uganda. The study also found five statistically insignificant variables. It was found that managers in <b>training</b> <b>institutions</b> in Uganda should encourage employees to assess their own performance. Managers should formulate a policy on transparency and practice open communication using the right communication channels. <b>Training</b> <b>institutions</b> in Uganda should consider having organic and flatter organisational structures with a wider span of control. Managers should regard economic variables such as inflation rates and tax obligations when planning and drawing up budgets as this will impact their profitability. There is a need in Uganda to collaborate with and forge close relationships with international <b>training</b> <b>institutions</b> and global partners to become more globally competitive. The study has provided general guidelines at individual level how to best utilize employees to improve performance of <b>training</b> <b>institutions</b> in Uganda. Furthermore, general operational guidelines at institutional level for improving performance of <b>training</b> <b>institutions</b> have been given for such institutions to become and remain competitive in the global market place. The study has also highlighted general guidelines regarding managing external environmental factors to assist in improving performance of <b>training</b> <b>institutions</b> in Uganda...|$|R
