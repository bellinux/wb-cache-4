5|$|Walter and Astrid {{find the}} source of the {{electromagnetic}} pulse, and begin investigating the house the pulse was built on. At the same time, Peter and Olivia go to a rural meeting place where <b>the</b> <b>sheriff</b> <b>said</b> they would find the truck's owner, only to be shot at by the sheriff and his deputy, who are hell bent on keeping the town's secret. Walter manages to turn off the pulse, and all of the townsfolk revert to their deformed appearance. The daughter of one of the army scientists saves Olivia and Peter from getting shot, and explains that her father stayed in Edina to perfect the pulse. After Walter pleads to Broyles to let the townspeople keep their secret, the Fringe team decides to not report the case so that the remaining residents can live a normal life.|$|E
25|$|Talks {{between the}} miners and the mine owners {{led to an}} {{agreement}} on June 4. But by this time, the mine owners had paid the local sheriff to raise another 1,200 deputies. Governor Waite declared the force of deputies to be illegal and disbanded, but <b>the</b> <b>sheriff</b> <b>said</b> {{he could no longer}} control the men. Waite ordered that the state militia restore order in the region.|$|E
25|$|There are {{no plans}} {{currently}} to modify any of the grade intersections north of Route199, where use of the parkway has not significantly increased. Putnam County has called {{for the construction of}} an actual interchange at Pudding Street. The state had added turn lanes and widened the median so that a school bus would not block the road, but members of the county's Traffic Safety Board, including <b>the</b> <b>sheriff,</b> <b>said</b> that accidents were still too frequent.|$|E
50|$|Gallardo called 9-1-1 upon {{reaching}} the Domino's store {{and returned to}} identify Tate, <b>the</b> <b>sheriff's</b> office <b>said</b> in a statement. No gun was recovered.|$|R

5000|$|In 2014 the United States Supreme Court {{ruled that}} jails cannot hold undocumented an illegal {{immigrant}} on an ICE [...] "detainer" [...] order after the prisoner has made bail Unless ICE has obtained an arrest warrant from a federal judge, which a spokesman for <b>the</b> <b>Sheriff's</b> office <b>said</b> had not been obtained in this case.|$|R
25|$|In January 1911, the Westmoreland County sheriff began deputizing {{striking}} miners {{as deputy}} sheriffs (although they served without pay). In May 1911, four sheriff's deputies were cited for {{contempt of court}} for venturing too close to coal company property. <b>The</b> <b>sheriff</b> <b>said</b> that the men had done so in their official capacity as deputies, but the local court fined them anyway. The Westmoreland County sheriff became so frustrated with the injunction that he refused to permit his deputies to patrol marches on public highways.|$|E
2500|$|According to the sheriff, {{after the}} death of Flores Borrego in September 2011, a gang in the United States were given orders by their Mexican {{superiors}} to recover a drug load that had been taken from the Gulf Cartel. The process did not go as planned and the gang members ended up kidnapping a group of dealers, leading to a shootout incident. <b>The</b> <b>sheriff</b> <b>said</b> that this [...] "represents the only direct spillover" [...] case of Mexico's drug war in South Texas, but stated that it was not directly related to Mexico. [...] After this incident, Todd Staples, a Republican party Commissioner of the Texas Department of Agriculture, set up a website asking the federal government to back state efforts to curb illegal activities along the Mexican border, and especially drug trafficking. In a report, Staples asked two decorated military generals to take on the assignment, and stated in September 2011 that [...] "living and conducting business in a Texas border county is tantamount to living in a war zone.” Staples announced that Mexican drug cartels are seeking to create their own turf in the United States, but especially on the South Texas, which they consider [...] "vulnerable." [...] The statement sparked criticism among local officials who argued that many of the Texan border cities have lower crime rates than cities like Houston, that are not along the border. Henry Cuellar, a Democratic party member and a U.S. Representative, strongly disagreed with Staples' assessment that the Texas border is a war zone or an area overrun by the Mexican criminal groups, and claimed that such claims simply create [...] "confusion" [...] and unnecessary alarmist reactions. On early November 2011, Greg Abbott, the Texas Attorney General, informed media outlets of a letter he sent to President Barack Obama on his failure to protect the border, and warned him that the drug violence from Mexico is increasingly [...] "spilling over" [...] the border, and urged Obama to [...] "immediately dedicate more manpower to border security." [...] In the letter, Abbott wrote about the shootings and kidnappings that have been occurring in the Rio Grande Valley, and how these incidents are a [...] "threat to national security." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "This case {{is now in}} {{the hands}} of the law," [...] {{answered}} Dick, coldly. Then <b>the</b> <b>sheriff,</b> who had <b>said</b> nothing, came forward and handcuffed the woman and marched her downstairs.|$|R
5000|$|In 1999, Baca {{established}} a special reserves program. According to the Los Angeles Times, {{the program was}} designed to cater to celebrities, executives, star athletes, and other [...] "notable persons". Some members of <b>the</b> <b>Sheriff's</b> Department <b>said</b> they were worried that the program would be abused, particularly by those seeking a backdoor way of securing a concealed weapons permit in Los Angeles County.|$|R
5000|$|The Oakland fire department, federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and the Alameda County Arson Task Force {{issued a}} report on June 19, 2017 about the fire. It stated that all 36 victims died of smoke inhalation. Only one person was seriously injured. <b>The</b> <b>sheriff's</b> office <b>said,</b> [...] "It appears that people either made it out safely, or they didn't make it out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all right, Koolau," [...] <b>the</b> <b>sheriff</b> <b>said</b> soothingly. [...] "I know you're a dead shot. But you won't shoot me. I {{have never}} done you any wrong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{was down}} upon you pretty hot, Mr. Jackson," [...] <b>the</b> <b>sheriff</b> <b>said</b> {{as they rode}} off. [...] "You don't {{seem to be in}} her good books." [...] Jackson muttered an imprecation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Wingfield," [...] <b>the</b> <b>sheriff</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I am {{the holder}} of a warrant to search your slave-huts and grounds for a runaway negro named Anthony Moore, the {{property}} of Mr. Jackson here." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{shooting}} was widely {{reported to have}} taken place on Saturday, February 11, 2006, based on the public statements of Katherine Armstrong, owner of the 50000 acre Armstrong Ranch. However, in her written statement to <b>the</b> <b>Sheriff,</b> she <b>said</b> that <b>the</b> shooting happened on February 12. Harry Whittington said shortly after the incident, [...] "Accidents do and will happen - and that’s what happened last Friday (February 10)." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{against the}} rules, miss," [...] he said, [...] "but I guess {{it will be}} all right." [...] He {{recalled}} that <b>the</b> <b>sheriff</b> had <b>said</b> that <b>the</b> girl's father was a friend of his, and so assumed that it would be safe to relax the rules in her behalf. He had been too long an employee of the county not to know that rules are often elastic to the proper pressure.|$|R
6000|$|As {{she faced}} <b>the</b> <b>sheriff</b> again she <b>said,</b> with merciless severity: [...] "I'd rather {{be in his}} place than yours." [...] Then, with a tired droop in her voice, she appealed to Ward: [...] "Take me away from here. I'm tired of this savage world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] <b>the</b> <b>sheriff</b> <b>said</b> {{in a tone}} {{which meant}} everything. [...] "Come out here," [...] he said to Anson. Anson went out with him, and he told him that Kendall had {{purchased}} goods on credit and gambled the money away, and was ruined.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I should {{advise you}} to {{keep your mouth shut}} about it till you get some {{positive}} proof," [...] <b>the</b> <b>sheriff</b> <b>said</b> dryly. [...] "I tell you it's no joke to accuse a member of a family like the Wingfields of helping runaway slaves to escape." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{are useful}} enough for close work," [...] <b>the</b> <b>sheriff</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "but {{if they see}} us coming, and {{barricade}} their house and open fire upon us, you will want something that carries further than a revolver. I can lend you a rifle {{as well as a}} horse, if you will accept them." ...|$|E

50|$|On September 30, 2010, David Hartley and {{his wife}} Tiffany, from McAllen, Texas, were in Mexican waters riding jet skis back from Mexico when they were {{allegedly}} chased by two boats containing about six gunmen. <b>The</b> Zapata County <b>Sheriff</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> woman escaped and reported {{that her husband was}} shot.

50|$|On 27 October 2009 {{a federal}} civil trial jury in Greensboro, North Carolina awarded $750,000 to Phelps after he sued Butler and <b>the</b> Moore County <b>Sheriff's</b> office. Tomeny's estate had {{previously}} settled out-of-court with <b>the</b> <b>sheriff's</b> office. Jurors <b>said</b> {{that they did}} not believe portions of Butler's testimony about what had occurred during the shooting incident.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's no good, Mr. Jackson," [...] <b>the</b> <b>sheriff</b> <b>said</b> at last. [...] "The man {{may have}} been here; he aint here now. The only place we haven't searched is the house, {{and you may be}} quite sure the slaves dare not conceal him there. Too many would get to know it. No, sir, he's made a bolt of it, and you will have to wait now till he is caught by chance, or shot by some farmer or other in the act of stealing." ...|$|E
6000|$|All {{this time}} <b>the</b> <b>Sheriff</b> <b>said</b> never a word but only looked about him like one {{suddenly}} awakened from sleep; {{but when he}} found himself going within the very depths of Sherwood his heart sank within him, for he thought, [...] "Surely my three hundred pounds will be taken from me, even if they take not my life itself, for I have plotted against their lives more than once." [...] But all seemed humble and meek and not a word was said of danger, either to life or money.|$|E
6000|$|... "We can look, anyway," [...] <b>the</b> <b>sheriff</b> <b>said,</b> and, {{opening a}} chest, {{he took out}} a number of volumes {{containing}} the records of his predecessors. [...] "Twelve years ago! Well, this is the volume. Now, Captain Wingfield, I have got some other business in hand that will take me a couple of hours. I will leave you out this volume and the one before it and the one after it, and if you like to go through them you may come across the description of some man that agrees with that of the man you are in search of." ...|$|E
5000|$|On May 16, 2017, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department seized 7,000 cockfighting birds at a ranch on Jackson Street in Val Verde, California. Although 2,700 birds {{had been}} sized {{from the same}} {{location}} in 2007, the 2017 raid was the [...] "largest cockfighting bust in U.S. history" [...] according to The Los Angeles Times, while <b>the</b> <b>sheriff</b> department <b>said</b> it was, [...] "one of the largest seizures of flying fowl used for illegal cockfighting and (for) breeding for illegal cockfighting purposes." [...] However, the owner was not arrested.|$|R
5000|$|Corona was {{provided}} legal aid and assigned a public defender, Roy Van den Heuvel, who hired several psychiatrists {{to perform a}} psychological evaluation. Although <b>the</b> <b>sheriff,</b> Roy Whiteaker, <b>said</b> <b>the</b> prisoner was in no apparent or immediate danger from his fellow townsmen, Corona {{was moved to the}} new and larger county jail in Marysville, on May 30, 1971, for [...] "security reasons." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The sheriff said," [...] Bill {{continued}} hastily, as if {{to preclude}} any interruption from <b>the</b> young man,--"the <b>sheriff</b> <b>said</b> he had been brought into Murphy's Camp three years before, dripping with water, and sufferin' from perkussion of the brain, and had been cared for generally by the boys 'round. When I told <b>the</b> <b>sheriff</b> I knowed 'im, I got him to leave him in my care; and I took him to 'Frisco, Tommy, to 'Frisco, and I put him in charge o' the best doctors there, and paid his board myself. There was nothin' he didn't have ez he wanted. Don't look that way, my dear boy, for God's sake, don't!" ...|$|R
60|$|When all was ready, the sheriff, {{carrying}} his white wand of office, and attended {{by some of}} the commissioners, went for Mary. She was at her devotions, and she asked a little delay that she might conclude them: perhaps the shrinking spirit clung at the last moment to life, and wished to linger a few minutes longer before taking the final farewell. The request was granted. In a short time Mary signified that she was ready, and they began to move toward the hall of execution. Her attendants were going to accompany her. <b>The</b> <b>sheriff</b> <b>said</b> this could not be allowed. She accordingly bade them farewell, and they filled the castle with the sound of their shrieks and lamentations.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{man came}} back {{half an hour}} ago," [...] <b>the</b> <b>sheriff</b> <b>said</b> to Vincent as they rode along. [...] "He found out that a man {{answering}} to your description arrived with another at Porter's about a fortnight ago, and is staying there still. Whether they brought a negress with them or not {{no one seems to}} have noticed. However, there is not a shadow of doubt that it is our man, and I shall be heartily glad to lay hold of him; for a brother of mine was badly wounded in that last affair, and though he lived some years afterward he was never the same man again. So I have a personal interest in it, you see." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{afternoon}} {{had come}} when the Sheriff mounted his horse and joined Robin Hood, who stood outside the gateway of the paved court waiting for him, for he had sold his horse and cart to a trader for two marks. Then they set forth upon their way, the Sheriff riding upon his horse and Robin running beside him. Thus they left Nottingham Town and traveled forward along the dusty highway, laughing and jesting together {{as though they had}} been old friends. But all the time <b>the</b> <b>Sheriff</b> <b>said</b> within himself, [...] "Thy jest to me of Robin Hood shall cost thee dear, good fellow, even four hundred pounds, thou fool." [...] For he thought he would make at least that much by his bargain.|$|E
60|$|Several {{shots were}} fired at the party {{as they made their}} way across to the end of the field, where the tall stalks of maize were still standing, though the corn had been {{gathered}} weeks before. As soon as they reached the shelter they separated, each crawling through the maize until they arrived within fifty yards of the house. There were, as <b>the</b> <b>sheriff</b> had <b>said,</b> many stumps still standing, and each ensconced himself behind one of these, and began to reply to the fire that the defenders kept up whenever they saw a movement among the cornstalks.|$|R
6000|$|Then <b>the</b> <b>Sheriff</b> arose and <b>said,</b> [...] "I {{thank you}} all, good yeomen, for the merry {{entertainment}} ye {{have given me}} this day. Right courteously have ye used me, showing therein that ye have much respect for our glorious King and his deputy in brave Nottinghamshire. But the shadows grow long, and I must away before darkness comes, lest I lose myself within the forest." ...|$|R
50|$|On November 7, 2011, Occupy Atlanta protesters {{camped out}} in a home in Snellville. It belonged to a police officer, who had {{contacted}} Occupy explaining that {{the house had been}} foreclosed upon and that he and his family were shortly to be evicted. The protesters left on the 10th after <b>the</b> local <b>sheriff</b> <b>said</b> that <b>the</b> family could be arrested for accessory to trespassing. Occupy Atlanta has stated that they hope this action, and similar ones planned in the future, will bring attention to the foreclosure crisis. A week later, Occupy Cleveland took similar action and succeeded in preventing the eviction of a family from a foreclosed home; the family were given 30 more days.|$|R
