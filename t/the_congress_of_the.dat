5|$|Discontinuing {{his studies}} before graduating when the college closed its doors during British {{occupation}} of the city, Hamilton {{played a major role}} in the American Revolutionary War. At the start of the war in 1775, he joined a militia company. In early 1776, he raised a provincial artillery company, to which he was appointed captain. He soon became the senior aide to General Washington, the American forces' commander-in-chief. Hamilton was dispatched by Washington on numerous missions to convey plans to his generals. After the war, Hamilton was elected as a representative to <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Confederation from New York. He resigned to practice law, and founded the Bank of New York.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-1890s onwards Giovanni Giorgi and Oliver Heaviside {{corresponded with}} each other {{regarding}} these anomalous results. This led to Giorgi presenting a paper to <b>the</b> <b>congress</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Associazione Elettrotecnica Italiana (A.E.I.) in October 1901 in which he showed that a coherent electro-mechanical system of units could be obtained by adding a fourth base unit of an electrical nature (ampere, volt or ohm) to the three base units proposed in the 1861 BAAS report. This gave the constants ke and km physical dimensions and hence the electro-mechanical quantities ε0 and µ0 were also given physical dimensions. His work also recognized the unifying concept that energy played {{in the establishment of}} a coherent, rational system of units with the joule as the unit of energy and the electrical units in the practical system of units remaining unchanged.|$|E

The following year, he and Đujić issued a proclamation in Chicago declaring {{their intention to}} organize Chetnik groups against Damjanović, who had since emigrated to Germany. Jevđević later received threatening letters warning him not {{to go through with}} such a plan for fear of disuniting the Yugoslav diaspora. Little is known of his activities after 1953.

5|$|The Northwest Territory {{was formed}} by <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Confederation on July 13, 1787, and {{included}} all land between the Appalachian Mountains, the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes and the Ohio River. This single territory became the states of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and part of eastern Minnesota. The act established an administration to oversee the territory and had the land surveyed in accordance with The Land Ordinance of 1785. At the time the territory was created, {{there were only two}} American settlements in what would become Indiana: Vincennes and Clark's Grant. The population of the northwest included fewer than 5,000 Europeans. The Native American population was estimated to be near 20,000, but may have been as high as 75,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{first presidential}} term {{and the first}} vice presidential term both officially started on March 4, 1789, the date set by <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Confederation for the {{beginning}} of operations of the federal government under the new U.S. Constitution. However, due to a delay in the counting and certification of the electoral votes, which was not done until April 6 (because although the Senate of the 1st Congress initially convened on March 4, it did not achieve a quorum until April 6, and so could not conduct business), they commenced several weeks late. Adams first presided over the Senate on April 21. Washington was inaugurated into office on April 30.|$|E

5|$|The {{first presidential}} term {{and the first}} vice presidential term both officially started on March 4, 1789, the date set by <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Confederation for the {{beginning}} of operations of the federal government under the new U.S. Constitution. However, due to the formidable difficulties of long-distance travel in 18th century America, they did not commence until several weeks later. Although the House of Representatives and the Senate convened on the prescribed date, both soon adjourned due to lack of a quorum. As a result, the presidential electoral votes could not be counted or certified. On April 1, the House convened with a quorum present for the first time, and the representatives began their work. The Senate first achieved a quorum on April 6. That is the date upon which the electoral votes were counted.|$|E
5|$|Three vice-presidents succeeded to the {{presidency}} due {{to the death of}} presidents - Sergio Osmeña (1944), Elpidio Quirino (1948) and Carlos P. Garcia (1957). They did not nominate a new vice-president, since the 1935 constitution was silent on the matter; a new vice-president would sit after the results of following elections were known. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo became president after the Supreme Court ruled that President Joseph Estrada resigned. Arroyo appointed Teofisto Guingona days after she ascended to power. The 1987 constitution mandated the President to nominate a vice-president from a member of <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Philippines, in which both houses vote separately for confirmation via a majority vote.|$|E
5|$|The {{subject of}} a {{permanent}} capital for the United States was discussed numerous times during the years immediately following the Revolutionary War, however, the Continental Congress could never agree on a site due to regional loyalties and tensions. In September 1788, <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Confederation selected New York City as the nation's temporary capital under the incoming federal government. The framers of the Constitution granted the new U.S. Congress exclusive governing jurisdiction over a federal district, intentionally separate from not beholden to any state. The Constitution, however, said nothing about where it would be. Discussions during the 1st Congress about where to locate the permanent seat of government revolved around two locations: one site on the Potomac River near Georgetown; and another site on the Susquehanna River near Wrights Ferry (now Columbia, Pennsylvania). The Susquehanna River site {{was approved by the}} House in September 1789, while legislation under consideration in the Senate specified a site on the Delaware River near Germantown, Pennsylvania. No agreement was reached, and the subject was deferred until the second session.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{this period}} the pro-independence forces made two {{important}} advances. In the Southern Cone, a veteran of the Spanish army with experience in the Peninsular War, José de San Martín, became the governor of the Province of Cuyo. He used this position to begin organizing an army as early as 1814 in preparation for an invasion of Chile. This was an important change in strategy after three United Provinces campaigns had been defeated in Upper Peru. San Martín's army became the nucleus of the Army of the Andes, which received crucial political and material support in 1816 when Juan Martín de Pueyrredón became Supreme Director of the United Provinces. In January 1817, San Martín was finally ready to advance against the royalists in Chile. Ignoring an injunction from <b>the</b> <b>congress</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Río de la Plata not to move against Chile, San Martín together with General Bernardo O'Higgins Riquelme, later Supreme Director of Chile, led the Army over the Andes in a move that turned the tables on the royalists. By February 10, San Martín had control of northern and central Chile, and a year later, after a war with no quarter, the south. With the aid of a fleet under the command of former British naval officer Thomas Cochrane, Chile was secured from royalist control and independence was declared that year. San Martín and his allies spent the next two years planning an invasion of Peru, which began in 1820.|$|E
