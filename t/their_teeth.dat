5|$|As {{noted by}} Arthur M. Greenhall:If there is fur {{on the skin}} of the host, the common vampire bat uses its canine and cheek teeth like a barber's blades to shave away the hairs. The bat's razor-sharp upper incisor teeth then make a 7mm wide and 8mm deep cut. The upper incisors lack enamel, which keeps them {{permanently}} razor sharp. <b>Their</b> <b>teeth</b> are so sharp, even handling their skulls in a museum can result in cuts.|$|E

50|$|Gomphotheres {{differed}} from elephants in <b>their</b> <b>tooth</b> structure, particularly the chewing surfaces on the molar teeth. The earlier species had four tusks, and their retracted facial and nasal bones prompted paleontologists {{to believe that}} gomphotheres had elephant-like trunks.|$|R
50|$|The {{evolution}} of monotreme eloctrolocation probably evolved {{in order to}} allow the animals to forage in murky waters, and may be tied to <b>their</b> <b>tooth</b> loss. The extinct Obdurodon was electroreceptive, but unlike the modern platypus it foraged pelagically.|$|R
5|$|A {{comprehensive}} analysis {{conducted in}} 1980 by Hopson questioned Thulborn's ideas. Hopson {{showed that the}} wear facet patterns on the teeth in fact indicate vertical and lateral rather than back and forth jaw movements. Furthermore, Hopson demonstrated variability {{in the degree of}} tooth wear, indicating continuous tooth replacement. He did acknowledge that X-ray images of the most complete specimen showed that this individual indeed lacked unerupted replacement teeth. According to Hopson, this indicated that only juveniles continuously replaced <b>their</b> <b>teeth,</b> and that this process ceased when reaching adulthood. Thulborn's aestivation hypothesis was rejected by Hopson due to lack of evidence.|$|E
5|$|A few species, {{specifically}} the common, white-winged, and hairy-legged vampire bats, exclusively consume animal blood (hematophagy). The common vampire bat typically feeds on large mammals such as cattle, while the hairy-legged and white-winged vampires feed on birds instead. Vampire bats target sleeping prey and can detect deep breathing. Heat sensors {{in the nose}} help them to detect blood vessels near {{the surface of the}} skin. They pierce the animal's skin with <b>their</b> <b>teeth,</b> biting away a small flap, and lap up the blood with their tongues, which have lateral grooves adapted to this purpose. The blood is kept from clotting by an anticoagulant in the saliva.|$|E
5|$|A {{specimen}} of Pinacosaurus preserves large paraglossalia (triangular bones or cartilages {{located in the}} tongue) which show signs of muscular stress, and it is {{thought this was a}} common feature of ankylosaurs. The researchers who examined the specimen suggested that ankylosaurs relied heavily on muscular tongues and hyobranchia (tongue bones) when feeding, since <b>their</b> <b>teeth</b> were fairly small and were replaced at a relatively slow rate. Some modern salamanders have similar tongue bones, and use prehensile tongues to pick up food. Based on the broadness of the ribcage, Ankylosaurus may have digested through a hindgut fermentation system like modern herbivorous lizards, which have several chambers in their enlarged colon.|$|E

5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates that megalodon preyed upon many cetacean species, such as dolphins, small whales, cetotheres, squalodontids, sperm whales, bowhead whales, and rorquals. In addition to this, they also targeted seals, sirenians, and large sea turtles. However, the shark was also an opportunist and piscivorous, {{and it would have}} also gone after smaller fish and other sharks. Many whale bones have been found with deep gashes most likely made by <b>their</b> <b>teeth.</b> Various excavations have revealed megalodon teeth lying close to the chewed remains of whales, and sometimes in direct association with them.|$|E
5|$|Fruit eating, or frugivory, {{is found}} in both major suborders. Bats prefer ripe fruit, pulling it off the trees with <b>their</b> <b>teeth.</b> They fly back to their roosts to eat the fruit, sucking out the juice and {{spitting}} the seeds and pulp out onto the ground. This helps disperse the seeds of these fruit trees, which may take root and grow where the bats have left them, and numerous species of plants depend on bats for seed dispersal. The Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) has been recorded carrying fruits weighing 3–14g (0.11–0.49oz) or even as much as 50g (1.8oz).|$|E
5|$|In Ancient China, rice was {{the staple}} crop {{in the south}} and wheat in the north, the latter made into dumplings, noodles, and pancakes. Vegetables used to {{accompany}} these included yams, soybeans, broad beans, turnips, spring onions, and garlic. The diet of the ancient Egyptians was based on bread, often contaminated with sand which wore away <b>their</b> <b>teeth.</b> Meat was a luxury but fish was more plentiful. These were accompanied by a range of vegetables including marrows, broad beans, lentils, onions, leeks, garlic, radishes, and lettuces.|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives : Increased {{concern over}} dental {{appearance}} {{has been observed}} during childhood and adolescence to early adulthood. The {{study was conducted with}} objectives to assess the self-perception of dental aesthetics, knowledge, attitude and management of dental trauma and halitosis. Materials and Methods : Self-administered questionnaire translated in Nepali language consisting of 32 questions was used. The completed questionnaires were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results : Out of the total study population, 63 % were satisfied with <b>their</b> overall <b>tooth</b> appearance and 71. 7 % with <b>their</b> <b>tooth</b> color. Twenty-nine percent had experienced dental trauma. More than half of the study population thought that immediate treatment was required after dental trauma. Fifty seven percent of the villagers had halitosis. Conclusion : The research clearly shows that the people of Aurabani VDC were satisfied with <b>their</b> <b>tooth</b> color and overall tooth appearance; however the knowledge regarding emergency management of dental trauma, the cause and management of halitosis was insufficient.

Later, {{at a meeting of the}} local chapter of International Brotherhood of Jazz Dancers, Pastry Chefs and Nuclear Technicians, Carl announces that the newest contract requires the union to give up their dental plan in exchange for a free keg of beer for their meeting. Homer slowly comprehends that giving up their dental plan would require him to pay for Lisa's braces and jumps into action, reminding everyone how their dental plan has helped them all.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds have streamlined, {{spindle-shaped}} {{bodies with}} reduced or non-existent external ear flaps, rounded heads, flexible necks, limbs modified into flippers, and small tails. Pinniped skulls have large eye orbits, short snouts and a constricted interorbital region. They are unique among carnivorans in that their orbital walls are significantly {{shaped by the}} maxilla and are not limited by certain facial bones. Compared to other carnivorans, <b>their</b> <b>teeth</b> tend to be fewer in number (especially incisors and back molars), are pointed and cone-shaped, and lack carnassials. The walrus has unique upper canines that are elongated into tusks. The mammary glands and genitals of pinnipeds can retract into the body.|$|E
5|$|Pudús have various {{methods of}} obtaining the foliage they need. Their small stature and {{cautious}} nature create obstacles in attaining food. They stop often while searching for food {{to stand on}} their hind legs and smell the wind, detecting food scents. Females and fawns peel bark from saplings using <b>their</b> <b>teeth,</b> but mature males may use their spikelike antlers. The deer may use their front legs to press down on saplings until they snap or become low enough to the ground so they can reach the leaves. Forced to stand on their hind legs due to their small size, the deer climb branches and tree stumps to reach higher foliage. They bend bamboo shoots horizontally in order to walk on them and eat from higher branches.|$|E
50|$|The age {{at which}} juveniles die can be {{indirectly}} inferred from <b>their</b> <b>tooth</b> morphology, development and emergence.

5|$|Rehabilitation is {{available}} to some confiscated slow lorises. Organizations such as the International Animal Rescue (IAR) run sanctuaries that offer lifelong care to slow lorises that have had <b>their</b> <b>teeth</b> removed, while also providing education and awareness programs to local people to help end domestic trade. By collaborating with authorities, healthy slow lorises are released back into the wild. However, identification is critical because authorities still manage all slow lorises {{as if they were}} from one species, resulting in species being released into the wrong locations and increasing confusion in taxonomy and conservation.|$|E
5|$|The Sable Island {{horses are}} a feral horse {{population}} that is entirely unmanaged: they {{are not subject to}} any kind of interference. Observational research, which is considered noninvasive to the herd, has been conducted by various entities over several decades. The population in recent years (2009 and onward) has varied between 400 and 550 animals. Due to the lack of predators, older horses often die of starvation after <b>their</b> <b>teeth</b> are worn down by a lifetime of exposure to sand and marram, a tough grass. A lack of nutritional food on the island limits the horses' size, and the offspring of those removed from the island and raised on better diets are significantly larger.|$|E
5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} {{is known}} to hybridise with the black wildebeest. The differences in social behaviour and habitats have historically prevented interspecific hybridisation, however it may occur when both species are confined within the same area, and the offspring is usually fertile. A study of these hybrid animals at Spioenkop Dam Nature Reserve in South Africa revealed that many had congenital abnormalities relating to <b>their</b> <b>teeth,</b> horns and the Wormian bones of the skull. Another study reported {{an increase in the}} size of the hybrid as compared to either of its parents. In some hybrid animals the auditory bullae are highly deformed and in others the radius and ulna are fused.|$|E
40|$|Poster Session - Scientific Groups: 1. Behavioral, Epidemiologic and Health Services Research: {{abstract}} no. 6 OBJECTIVES: {{to describe}} the mother's attitudes and self-efficacy toward brushing teeth of 1 -year-old child. METHODS: A study was conducted on mothers who had child at age 1 in good general health. A questionnaire was completed by these mothers on their self-efficacy and attitudes toward brushing <b>their</b> child's <b>teeth.</b> Mothers' education levels were collected in the questionnaire as well. RESULTS: This study included 262 mothers whose children attended day care centers or parenting education centers. More than half (59 %) of the mothers reported a high education level (14 {{or more years of}} schooling). The proportions of mothers who thought they knew how to brush <b>their</b> child's <b>teeth</b> properly were 36 % and 25 %, in the low and high education groups respectively (Chi-square test, p= 0. 031). Similar proportion of mothers in low and high education groups thought they were able to brush <b>their</b> child's <b>teeth,</b> 67 % and 63 %, respectively (p> 0. 05). In both education groups, more than 95 % of the mothers believed it was important to brush <b>their</b> child's <b>teeth.</b> More than 70 % of mothers in both education groups would force their child to brush teeth. CONCLUSION: Mother's attitudes toward brushing <b>their</b> child's <b>teeth</b> were very positive but their perceived self-efficacy was low, with little difference between mothers with different education levels. Training on parental toothbrushing should be delivered to all the mothers of 1 -year-old children to improve their self-efficacy and practice in brushing <b>their</b> child's <b>teeth.</b> link_to_OA_fulltextThe 25 th IADR-SEA Division Annual Scientific Meeting, Singapore, 28 - 30 October 2011...|$|R

50|$|During the Last Glacial Maximum 20,000 YBP, the Pleistocene steppe {{stretched}} across northern and central Eurasia and through Beringia into North America. The Pleistocene wolves of Beringia, and perhaps those across the steppe, were adapted to this habitat. <b>Their</b> <b>tooth</b> and skull morphology indicates that they specialized in preying on now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna, and <b>their</b> <b>tooth</b> wear indicates that their behavior was different to modern wolves. This highlights {{the success of}} C. lupus as a species in adapting to different environmental conditions. This gray wolf ecomorph became extinct {{at the end of}} the glaciation, along with the horse and other species on which it depended, and was replaced by wolves from southern North America. This indicates that specialized wolf ecomorphs can become extinct when their environment changes even though the habitat may still support other wolves. Wolves went through a population bottleneck 20,000 YBP that coincides with the Last Glacial Maximum, which indicates that many wolf populations may have gone extinct at the same time as the Beringian wolves.|$|R
5|$|The {{debate about}} whether Tyrannosaurus was a {{predator}} or a pure scavenger {{is as old as}} the debate about its locomotion. Lambe (1917) described a good skeleton of Tyrannosaurus close relative Gorgosaurus and concluded that it and therefore also Tyrannosaurus was a pure scavenger, because the Gorgosaurus teeth showed hardly any wear. This argument is no longer taken seriously, because theropods replaced <b>their</b> <b>teeth</b> quite rapidly. Ever since the first discovery of Tyrannosaurus most scientists have speculated that it was a predator; like modern large predators it would readily scavenge or steal another predator's kill if it had the opportunity.|$|E
5|$|The simple, low-crowned teeth {{indicate}} that Paraceratherium was a browser with a diet consisting of relatively soft leaves and shrubs. Later rhinoceroses were grazers, with high-crowned teeth because their diets contained grit that quickly wore down <b>their</b> <b>teeth.</b> Studies of mesowear on Paraceratherium teeth confirm the creatures {{had a soft}} diet of leaves; microwear studies {{have yet to be}} conducted. Isotope analysis shows that Paraceratherium fed chiefly on C3 plants, which are mainly leaves. Like its perissodactyl relatives, the horses, tapirs, and other rhinoceroses, Paraceratherium would have been a hindgut fermenter; it would extract relatively little nutrition from its food and would have to eat large volumes to survive. Like other large herbivores, Paraceratherium would have had a large digestive tract.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{is small}} in {{relation}} {{to the size of the}} animal. The jaws are lined with spatulate (chisel-like) teeth suited to an herbivorous diet. The snout of Apatosaurus and similar diplodocoids is squared, with only Nigersaurus having a squarer skull. The braincase of Apatosaurus is well preserved in specimen BYU17096, which also preserved much of the skeleton. A phylogenetic analysis found that the braincase had a morphology similar to those of other diplodocoids. Some skulls of Apatosaurus have been found still in articulation with <b>their</b> <b>teeth.</b> Those teeth that have the enamel surface exposed do not show any scratches on the surface; instead, they display a sugary texture and little wear.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that some smaller toothed whales may have <b>their</b> <b>tooth</b> arrangement suited to aid in echolocation. The placement of teeth in the jaw of a bottlenose dolphin, for example, are not symmetrical when seen from a vertical plane, and this asymmetry could possibly be an aid in the dolphin sensing if echoes from its biosonar are coming from one side or the other. However, this idea lacks experimental support.|$|R

Typically, the mandibular central incisors erupt first, followed by the maxillary central incisors, the mandibular lateral incisors and finally the maxillary laterals. The rest of the primary dentition erupts after the incisors.|$|R
