5|$|All {{four men}} began the SMW Tag Team Championship match in the ring. The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson) {{controlled}} {{most of the}} opening of the match with aerial maneuvers against <b>The</b> <b>Heavenly</b> Bodies (Jimmy Del Ray and Tom Pritchard). Del Ray tried to help his partner but superkicked him instead. <b>The</b> <b>Heavenly</b> Bodies gained the advantage after Pritchard performed a powerbomb on Morton, which Del Ray followed with a moonsault. Del Ray and Morton fought back and forth, with Del Ray performing another moonsault and Morton executing a hurricanrana. After all four wrestlers brawled in the ring once more, Del Ray hit Gibson in the back with a tennis racquet. Pritchard then pinned Gibson to win the belts for <b>The</b> <b>Heavenly</b> Bodies.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Heavenly</b> Bodies did {{not become}} serious contenders to the tag team title, and the Steiners soon began a feud with The Quebecers, a new team in the WWF.|$|E
5|$|The hall {{contains}} eleven sculptures {{from the}} Northern Han period. These {{are the only}} Chinese sculptures from the period that survive from outside the Mogao Grottoes. There is a main statue of Sakyamuni flanked by Bodhisattvas and <b>the</b> <b>Heavenly</b> Kings.|$|E

5|$|The {{match between}} the Steiner Brothers and <b>The</b> <b>Heavenly</b> Bodies {{received}} little buildup. The Bodies were a successful tag team in Jim Cornette's Smoky Mountain Wrestling, and an interpromotional agreement {{allowed them to}} challenge for the WWF Tag Team Championship.|$|E
5|$|Heaven is {{represented}} by an entrance to <b>the</b> <b>Heavenly</b> City, which is in a contemporary Gothic style illuminated by long, thin rays of light. The saved approach clasping their hands in prayer, and are greeted at the entrance by an angel. Only a few souls pass through <b>the</b> <b>heavenly</b> gates at a time. The imagery of a church as an earthly representation of Heaven was popularised in the 13th century by theologians such as Durandus; the gate to Heaven in this work resembles {{the entrance to the}} Beaune hospice. The way to Heaven is shown clearly as a gilded church– the saved ascend a set of steps, turn right, and disappear from sight. It is fully enclosed in a single panel, whereas Hell extends onto the adjoining panel, perhaps hinting that sin contaminates all around it.|$|E
5|$|If {{there is}} {{anything}} that humanity cannot produce, the being who produces it is better than humanity. But humanity cannot produce {{the things that are}} in the universe – <b>the</b> <b>heavenly</b> bodies, etc. The being, therefore, who produces them is superior to humanity. But who is there that is superior to humanity, except God? Therefore, God exists.|$|E

5|$|Later Greek philosophers, {{observing the}} motions of <b>the</b> <b>heavenly</b> bodies, were {{concerned}} with developing models of the Universe-based more profoundly on empirical evidence. The first coherent model was proposed by Eudoxus of Cnidos. According to Aristotle's physical interpretation of the model, celestial spheres eternally rotate with uniform motion around a stationary Earth. Normal matter is entirely contained within the terrestrial sphere.|$|E
5|$|Taizong's {{adoption}} of <b>the</b> <b>Heavenly</b> Kaghan title {{was used to}} legitimize {{his role as a}} steppe khan not solely as a Chinese emperor with the title of Son of Heaven. He valued the kaghan title and was sincere about his role as a leader of Central Asia. He sought to solidify his claim as a kaghan by organizing a gathering of Turkic leaders in the Lingzhou fortress during the last years of his reign to reconfirm his title.|$|E
5|$|Tekno Team 2000 {{made their}} WWF debut during a house show at Madison Square Garden on March 19, 1995. They {{defeated}} <b>The</b> <b>Heavenly</b> Bodies (Tom Prichard and Jimmy Del Ray) and repeated the result {{the following night}} at Boston Garden. Their WWF television debut {{took place on the}} May 27, 1995 episode of WWF Superstars; they defeated Barry Horowitz and the Brooklyn Brawler. They were booked to appear in a series of matches against <b>The</b> <b>Heavenly</b> Bodies. Del Ray was not able to appear in several of the matches, so he was replaced by Mantaur and Barry Horowitz in several of the matches. Tekno Team 2000 won all of the matches in this series. The WWF teased a storyline in which Tekno Team 2000 was being scouted by Ted DiBiase to join the Million Dollar Corporation, but they did not join the group. Their success led Pro Wrestling Illustrated to rank them among the top ten tag teams in the world.|$|E

5|$|The Smoky Mountain Wrestling Tag Team Championship was defended at Survivor Series {{as part of}} {{a working}} {{agreement}} between WWF owner Vince McMahon and Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW) owner Jim Cornette. The Rock 'n' Roll Express, who held the belts going into the event, had been feuding with <b>The</b> <b>Heavenly</b> Bodies over the title for over a year. The rivalry had been violent at times, including a barbed wire cage match and a Texas deathmatch.|$|E
5|$|In 1847, Mormon {{farmers from}} the Salt Lake area {{became the first}} people of European descent to settle the Virgin River region. In 1851, the Parowan and Cedar City, Utah areas were settled by Mormons who used the Kolob Canyons area for timber, and for grazing cattle, sheep, and horses. They prospected for mineral deposits, and {{diverted}} Kolob water to irrigate crops in the valley below. Mormon settlers named the area Kolob—in Mormon scripture, <b>the</b> <b>heavenly</b> place nearest the residence of God.|$|E
5|$|In Korean mythology, a tiger and a bear {{prayed to}} Hwanung, {{the son of}} the Lord of Heaven, that they might become human. Upon hearing their prayers, Hwanung gave them 20 cloves of garlic and a bundle of mugwort, {{ordering}} them to eat only this sacred food and remain out of the sunlight for 100 days. The tiger gave up after about twenty days and left the cave. However, the bear persevered and was transformed into a woman. The bear and the tiger are said to represent two tribes that sought the favor of <b>the</b> <b>heavenly</b> prince.|$|E

5|$|The Steiner Brothers {{were the}} {{audience}} favorites in the WWF Tag Team Championship match, {{as they were}} defending the belts in their hometown. Before the match began, <b>The</b> <b>Heavenly</b> Bodies attacked them. When the match began, the Bodies executed several double-team maneuvers on Rick Steiner. Scott tagged in and {{took control of the}} match. The Bodies soon regained the advantage, and Jim Cornette got involved by hitting Scott in the throat with a tennis racket. Rick tagged back in and hit several Steiner-Lines before Prichard attacked him with Cornette's tennis racket. Del Ray accidentally hit Prichard with a moonsault, however, allowing Scott to hit a Frankensteiner and Rick to get the pin.|$|E
5|$|The {{accounts}} of Mahavira's death vary among the Jain texts, some describing a simple death but others describing grandiose celebrations attended by gods and kings. According to the Jinasena's Mahapurana, <b>the</b> <b>heavenly</b> beings arrived to perform his funeral rites; in others he is described, at age 72, {{to be giving}} his final preaching over six days to a large crowd of people. Everyone falls asleep, only to awaken to find that he has disappeared, leaving only his nails and hair, which his followers cremate.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{categories}} of ritual in Lingbao Daoism. The first is known as <b>the</b> <b>heavenly</b> Golden Register of Rituals, and is carried out to prevent natural disasters. During the Tang Dynasty, this ritual {{was carried out in}} honour of the imperial family, but later it could be performed by anyone. The earthly Yellow Register ritual was performed to ensure the dead was at rest. The final type of ritual, which has not survived, was the human Jade Register, which was performed to ensure the salvation of mankind. Of the rituals that have survived, the Golden Register has assumed the role of the Jade register, ensuring salvation and preventing bad weather.|$|E

5|$|Watts {{has stated}} that the WWF {{intended}} to have Tekno Team 2000 win the WWF Tag Team Championship after two months in the promotion. After Watts' father, Bill Watts, began booking matches, the team was later sent to developmental territories to improve their skills. They returned to USWA in Tennessee, where they had wrestled a tag team match together in April 1995 under their real names. Competing as Tekno Team 2000, they defeated PG-13 on September 18. They began losing matches, however, while facing PG-13, <b>The</b> <b>Heavenly</b> Bodies, and The Bushwhackers. On October 30, Troy and Travis reversed their fortunes and defeated King Cobra and Spellbinder.|$|E
5|$|Well Dunn {{continued}} {{to face the}} top teams in the WWF, including The Smoking Gunns, The Headshrinkers, and the newly formed team of Sparky Plugg and the 1-2-3 Kid. When The Smoking Gunns were unable to compete due {{to the birth of}} Billy Gunn's son, Well Dunn competed against <b>The</b> <b>Heavenly</b> Bodies instead; these matches were unusual, as they pitted heel tag teams against each other. As in 1993, Well Dunn lost more matches than they won in each series, but they had occasional victories against established tag teams and were often booked to defeat jobber tag teams.|$|E
5|$|At {{an unknown}} date, {{which may have}} been in the early 640s, East Anglia was {{attacked}} by a Mercian army and Ecgric was obliged to defend it with a much smaller force, though one that was not negligible. The East Angles appealed to Sigeberht to leave his monastery and lead them in battle, hoping that his presence and the memory of his former military exploits would encourage the army and make them less likely to flee. Sigeberht refused, saying that he had renounced his worldly kingdom and now lived only for <b>the</b> <b>heavenly</b> kingdom. However, he was dragged from the monastery to the battlefield where, unwilling to bear arms, he went into battle carrying only a staff. The Mercians were victorious and Sigeberht, Ecgric and many of the East Angles were slain and their army was routed. In this way Sigeberht became a Christian martyr. He is among the names of the kings who according to an ancient saying, were avenged by the slaying of Penda in 654.|$|E
