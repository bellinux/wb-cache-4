5|$|Originally {{the actions}} of this tengu were portrayed as another attempt by demons to throw the world into chaos and war, but as Yoshitsune's renown as a legendary warrior increased, his monstrous teacher came to be {{depicted}} {{in a much more}} sympathetic and honorable light. In {{one of the most famous}} renditions of the story, the Noh play Kurama Tengu, Ushiwaka is the only person from his temple who does not give up an outing in disgust at <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> strange yamabushi. Sōjōbō thus befriends the boy and teaches him out of sympathy for his plight.|$|E

5|$|The first {{documented}} {{invasion of}} Gibraltar {{was by the}} Moors, Muslim Arabs and Berbers who arrived from North Africa {{at the beginning of}} the eighth century. They used the area as a base from which to launch an invasion of the rest of the Iberian Peninsula which resulted in most of Iberia coming under Moorish rule. The Spanish Reconquista began later in the eighth century. The campaign eventually took 800 years to force the Moors back across the Strait, and did not reach the Bay of Gibraltar until the fourteenth century. It was not until 1309, nearly 600 years after Gibraltar was first settled, that the first siege of Gibraltar was recorded. King Ferdinand I of Castile began a siege of Algeciras on the other side of the bay in July, but his naval blockade was unable to stop supplies being smuggled in small boats from Gibraltar to the besieged city. He sent an army under Alonso Pérez de Guzmán to take Gibraltar. De Guzmán succeeded after a month-long siege, and Gibraltar was settled by the Castilians for the first time. Six years later, the Moors attempted to retake the peninsula in the brief second siege which was abandoned at <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Castilian relief force. Another Moorish attempt eventually succeeded in the third siege of February–June 1333. A Castilian attempt to retake it in the fourth siege of June–August 1333 failed, as did the fifth siege of 1349–50, in which King Alfonso XI of Castile lost his life in an outbreak of bubonic plague among the besiegers. The Moors of Granada and Fez fell out with each other over Gibraltar in 1411, leading to the Granadans besieging the fortified town in the sixth siege and seizing it from the Marinids of Fez. Enrique Pérez de Guzmán, 2nd Count de Niebla made a failed attempt to capture Gibraltar in the seventh siege of 1436, during which he perished.|$|E
5|$|The magpie is {{generally}} sedentary and territorial throughout its range, living in groups occupying a territory, or in flocks or fringe groups. A group may occupy {{and defend the}} same territory for many years. Much energy is spent defending a territory from intruders, particularly other magpies, and different behaviours are seen with different opponents. <b>The</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> raptor results in a rallying call by sentinel birds and subsequent coordinated mobbing of the intruder. Magpies place themselves {{either side of the}} bird of prey so that it will be attacked from behind should it strike a defender, and harass and drive the raptor to some distance beyond the territory. A group will use carolling as a signal to advertise ownership and warn off other magpies. In the negotiating display, the one or two dominant magpies parade along the border of the defended territory {{while the rest of the}} group stand back a little and look on. The leaders may fluff their feathers or caroll repeatedly. In a group strength display, employed if both the opposing and defending groups are of roughly equal numbers, all magpies will fly and form a row at the border of the territory. The defending group may also resort to an aerial display where the dominant magpies, or sometimes the whole group, swoop and dive while calling to warn an intruding magpie's group.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Klabautermann is an ill omen, {{and in the}} 19th century, it was {{the most}} feared sight among sailors.

25|$|When one is {{reminded}} of true beauty by <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> beautiful boy, he {{is called a}} lover.

25|$|By {{the same}} reasoning, this {{statement}} is evidence that (2) if something is not black then {{it is not a}} raven. But since (as above) {{this statement is}} logically equivalent to (1) all ravens are black, it follows that <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> green apple is evidence supporting the notion that all ravens are black. This conclusion seems paradoxical, because it implies that information has been gained about ravens by looking at an apple.|$|E

25|$|Credit for {{the concept}} of {{training}} Chinese in Western military tactics and arming them with the best available weaponry is sometimes given to Ward, other times to Li Hongzhang, a local Imperial commander “ordered to cooperate with — {{and keep an eye}} on — Ward's unruly contingent” and other times to Burgevine, who according to some began the training while Ward was recuperating, having been inspired by <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Chinese gun crew acting under French direction.|$|E
25|$|In Italy, Petrarch {{developed}} the sonnet form pioneered by Giacomo da Lentini and Dante's Vita Nuova. In 1327, {{according to the}} poet, <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> woman called Laura in the church of Sainte-Claire d'Avignon awoke in him a lasting passion, celebrated in the Rime sparse ("Scattered rhymes"). Later, Renaissance poets who copied Petrarch's style named this collection of 366 poems Il Canzoniere ("The Song Book"). Laura {{is in many ways}} both the culmination of medieval courtly love poetry and the beginning of Renaissance love lyric.|$|E

25|$|After {{graduating from}} St. Mary's in May 1930, Lady Bird {{toyed with the}} idea of going back to Alabama.

As the plane landed, she was awed by <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> field covered with bluebonnets and instantly fell in love with the city. Lady Bird received a Bachelor of Arts degree in history with honors in 1933 and a second bachelor's degree in journalism cum laude in 1934. She was active on campus in different organizations, such as Orange Jackets, and believed in student leadership. Her goal was to become a reporter, but she also earned a teaching certificate.|$|E
25|$|Another popular running gag {{concerned}} the social habits of Benny's on-air orchestra, who were consistently {{portrayed as a}} bunch of drunken ne'er-do-wells. Led first by Phil Harris and later by Bob Crosby, the orchestra, and in particular band member Frank Remley, were jokingly portrayed as often being too drunk to play properly, using an overturned bass drum to play cards on just minutes before a show, and so enamored of liquor that <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> glass of milk would make them sick. Remley was portrayed in various unflattering situations, such as being thrown into a garbage can by a road sweeper who had found him passed {{out in the street}} at 4am, and on a wanted poster at the Beverly Hills police station.|$|E

50|$|With such {{technological}} improvements, the Vikings {{began to}} make more and more ocean voyages, as their ships were more seaworthy. However, in order to sail in ocean waters, the Vikings needed to develop methods of relatively precise navigation. Most commonly, a ship’s pilot drew on traditional knowledge to guide the ship’s path. Essentially, the Vikings simply used prior familiarity with tides, sailing times, and landmarks in order to route courses. For example, scholars contend that <b>the</b> <b>sighting</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> whale allowed <b>the</b> Vikings to determine the direction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ship. Because whales feed in highly nutritious waters, commonly found in regions where landmasses have pushed deep-water currents towards shallower areas, <b>the</b> <b>sighting</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> whale functioned as a signal that land was near.|$|R
25|$|Raymond {{tells of}} the words he heard Sir Ackroyd say behind the closed door at 9.30 and Blunt also says he heard the words when he was walking on the terrace but his {{attention}} was caught by <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> woman in white just passing behind a hedge in the garden.

25|$|On 20 January 2006 <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> team of men hacking at {{the roof}} of the mosque sparked a riot in the town.

In the mosque the mob ripped out the ventilation fans that had been presented by the US Embassy {{at the time of the}} Iraq War and then went on a rampage through the town. The crowd ransacked the Cultural Mission, the mayor's home, destroyed the car belonging to the imam's younger brother and damaged three cars belonging to the Imam himself. The local police were overwhelmed and had to call in reinforcements from Mopti. One man died during the disturbances.|$|E
