25|$|For example, in the Munjeon Bonpuli, {{the evil}} goddess of <b>the</b> <b>outhouse,</b> Noiljadae (or her daughter, {{depending}} on the source), kills Yeosan Buin and attempts to kill the seven children. However, Noiljadae suicides when her plan is foiled by the seventh son, Nokdisaengin, and Yeosan Buin is brought back to life through the Hwansaengkkot flowers.|$|E

25|$|Hostage Martin Cherry, an old {{platelayer}} of the district, {{was found}} dying from a groin wound in <b>the</b> <b>outhouse</b> or kitchen, immediately behind the main building. He was promptly {{taken from the}} burning hotel and laid on the ground, where Father Gibney administered the last sacrament. Cherry was insensible, and barely alive. He succumbed within half an hour. He was fortunate to not have burned alive. He {{seemed to have been}} unintentionally shot by the attacking force.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrangements}} inside <b>the</b> <b>outhouse</b> vary by culture. In Western societies, many, {{though not}} all, {{have at least}} one seat with a hole in it, above a small pit. Others, often in more rural, older areas in European countries, simply have a hole with two indents on either side for your feet. In Eastern societies, there is a hole in the floor, over which the user crouches. A roll of toilet paper is usually available. Old corn cobs, leaves, or other types of paper are also used.|$|E
25|$|With the {{termination}} of passenger traffic in 1968, the ground floor became disused. It rented to Trosvik Verkstad, which at first used it for office space. Later it converted the southern part into a physician's office. From 1982 the upper story was also available and rented to the same company, until it went bankrupt in 1986. A series of renovations were carried out, which partially destroyed many dignified aspects of the building. Following the bankruptcy, the station building was sold to Nydalen Compagnie. As they did not use it, the building occupied by homeless, who scavenged the building for molding and similar which was used for firewood, rapidly dilapidating the building. Brevik Management bought the building in 1988, fixed it up and moved their head office there from December 1988. Also <b>the</b> <b>outhouse,</b> which had been disused since the 1960s, was restored. The renovation work was awarded Sparebankens Brevikspris in 1991. The station building and two outhouses were listed as cultural heritage sites in 1997.|$|E
50|$|To {{the west}} of <b>the</b> <b>outhouses</b> and within <b>the</b> shrine {{enclosure}} are two dead trees said to have sprung from thepegs which {{were used for the}} head and heel ropes of Kaki, the saintâ€™s mare.|$|R

500|$|High {{winds and}} rough seas were {{observed}} in Louisiana. In Port Eads, five-minute sustained winds reached , before the anemometer blew away. At the same location, a 24-hour rainfall record was set {{for the month of}} August, with [...] of precipitation observed. According to a contemporaneous report, the weather instrument shelter was swept away due to storm tides and the flag staff was broken. While the office building did weather the storm intact, documents in it were soaked. However, a report written in 2010 states that in Port Eads only the lighthouse remained standing {{in the aftermath of the}} devastation. Fifteen fatalities were reported after a house was swept away by storm tides. The 2010 report, however, states that a total of ten deaths were caused by the storm over its entire existence. In Pilottown, the large [...] "lookout" [...] tower was toppled and destroyed. <b>The</b> <b>outhouse</b> that displaymen used and slept in was blown over and then rapidly filled with water, due to tides rising to [...] in only 10minutes. Additionally, property of the Weather Bureau was also damaged.|$|E

2500|$|In Newfoundland, a {{well-known}} song entitled [...] "Good Old Newfie Outhouse" [...] sings {{the praises of}} using <b>the</b> <b>outhouse</b> when it is -25 degrees out, mentioning pleasures like pants being frozen in position at the knees. A version by singer Bobby Evans is available on an album called Silly Songs on iTunes.|$|E
60|$|Macdonald's {{house had}} indeed become almost uninhabitable. It stood so {{deep in the}} water that only the upper windows were visible. The {{chimneys}} and roofs of some of <b>the</b> <b>outhouses</b> formed, with <b>the</b> main building and a few tree-tops, a small Archipelago.|$|R
2500|$|During the 1930s {{the schoolhouse}} {{was also the}} township's meeting hall, as well as hosting many {{different}} functions, activities and {{both public and private}} events. It also served as the community's LDS church. During <b>the</b> 1940s <b>the</b> <b>outhouses</b> were replaced by interior restrooms and indoor plumbing.|$|R
50|$|Nowadays {{the palace}} houses the Lithuanian Academy of Music and Theatre. In <b>the</b> {{meantime}} <b>the</b> <b>outhouses</b> are undergoing <b>the</b> restoration {{and the main}} palace is planned to come next.

2500|$|Additional {{buildings}} house more exhibits. [...] One is a th {{scale model}} of the entire Mystic River area c.1870, complete down to <b>the</b> <b>outhouse</b> behind every residence, a model [...] long. Another contains a collection of carved ship figureheads. [...] Also among the museum's buildings is a planetarium that demonstrates how seamen used stars for navigation.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>outhouse</b> is wood-frame {{structure}} with a gable roof. [...] It is now {{located at the}} northwest corner of the compound. [...] However, it was customary to relocate outhouses periodically so its location probably changed a number of times while it was in use at the ranch. [...] It has shiplap siding with corner boards. [...] It has a vertical plank door on north side.|$|E
2500|$|Two tales {{are told}} {{of the origins of}} his famous nickname. According to one legend, he picked up the name during a brief attempt at boxing. Another story told by his fellow North Side Jews alleges that young Isadore Blumenfeld would always lock himself in <b>the</b> <b>outhouse</b> (that is, the [...] "can") to avoid gang fights in the neighborhood. Kid Cann indignantly denied both versions.|$|E
50|$|Stone {{from the}} priory {{was used to}} build Monmouth House in the village, and traces of its {{buildings}} may remain in <b>the</b> <b>outhouses.</b> There are also surface marks in surrounding fields, however these may not be from the building itself but from the excavation of stone.|$|R

50|$|In February 1933 the {{institution}} purchased {{the land and}} plans were made {{for the construction of}} an Anglo-Indian School, a boarding home and a convent. Eight rooms were erected by 21 March 1934. Two months later, Bishop Carvalho laid the foundation for a new building in Mambalam(now T.Nagar). On 1 June 1934 Our Lady's Kindergarten was opened comprising <b>the</b> <b>outhouses.</b> <b>The</b> first headmistress was M. Notre Dame de Pompei, born in India to Irish parents.|$|R
2500|$|Outhouses are {{typically}} built on one level, but two-story models {{are to be}} found in unusual circumstances. One double-decker was built to serve a two-story building in Cedar Lake, Michigan. <b>The</b> <b>outhouse</b> was connected by walkways. It still stands (but not the building). The waste from [...] "upstairs" [...] is directed down a chute separate from the [...] "downstairs" [...] facility in these instances, so contrary to various jokes about two-story outhouses, the user of the lower level has nothing to fear if the upper level is in use at the same time.|$|E
2500|$|The {{decoration}} on <b>the</b> <b>outhouse</b> door has no standard. The well-known {{crescent moon}} on American outhouses was popularized by cartoonists {{and had a}} questionable basis in fact. There are authors who claim the practice began {{during the colonial period}} as an early [...] "mens"/"ladies" [...] designation for an illiterate populace (the sun and moon being popular symbols for the sexes during those times). Others dismiss the claim as an urban legend. What is certain is {{that the purpose of the}} hole is for venting and light and there were a wide variety of shapes and placements employed.|$|E
2500|$|That evening, {{a little}} after eight o'clock, Peace {{observed}} Mrs. Dyson coming out from her back door and entering a nearby outhouse. When she duly emerged, he confronted her with a revolver, shouting [...] "Speak or I'll fire." [...] In terror, Mrs. Dyson retreated back into <b>the</b> <b>outhouse,</b> and her husband came out to investigate. Peace fled down the passage, where Dyson followed him. Peace fired twice at Dyson, the second shot passing fatally through his temple. As Mrs. Dyson cried [...] "Murder!", Peace escaped {{and made his way}} by train to Hull, where his wife kept an eating-house.|$|E

As one writer opined, [...] "...it does not much feel like Europe when you're there. It feels more like Central Asia or the Middle East." [...] <b>The</b> <b>outhouse</b> is surrounded by and covered in ice, perched {{off the end of}} a rock, and with a pipe pouring effluvia onto the mountain. It consistently receives low marks for sanitation and convenience, but {{is considered to be a}} unique experience.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are other}} types of toilet that may be covered by an {{outhouse}} superstructure, or a toilet tent (e.g. in humanitarian relief operations), or even be installed inside a house that is {{beyond the reach of}} sewers. The Swedish Pacto toilet uses a continuous roll of plastic to collect and dispose of waste. A modern analogy to <b>the</b> <b>outhouse</b> is the [...] "Clivus Multrum", which is an electric and waterless composting toilet. They are an alternative to outhouses and septic fields, and provide effective sanitation in areas too remote for sewer lines. Incinerating toilets are installed in several thousand cabins in Norway. These toilets incinerate waste into ashes, using only propane and 12 volt electricity.|$|E
2500|$|The {{increasingly}} difficult times {{brought on by}} the Viking attacks are reflected in both Ã†lfric's and Wulfstan's works, but most notably in Wulfstan's fierce rhetoric in the Sermo Lupi ad Anglos, dated to 1014. Malcolm Godden suggests that ordinary people saw the return of the Vikings, as the imminent [...] "expectation of the apocalypse", and this was given voice in Ã†lfric and Wulfstan writings, which {{is similar to that of}} Gildas and Bede. Raids were signs of God punishing his people, Ã†lfric refers to people adopting the customs of the Danish and exhorts people not to abandon the native customs on behalf of the Danish ones, and then requests a 'brother Edward', to try to put an end to a 'shameful habit' of drinking and eating in <b>the</b> <b>outhouse,</b> which some of the countrywomen practised at beer parties.|$|E
50|$|In 1828 it {{was sold}} by the Hawkins family to Joseph Neeld who built many of <b>the</b> <b>outhouses.</b> It passed down through the family to the Inigo-Jones family, who added an {{entrance}} lodge and the porch over the main entrance.

25|$|The final estate layout was {{established}} under Pyotr Saltykovâ€™s heir - Ivan Saltykov, when a neighboring court {{and a vast}} umbrageous garden were adjoined to the estate. The mansion itself was rebuilt in Classical style. In 1804 it was renewed: a second floor was added and the wings were connected to <b>the</b> <b>outhouses.</b> <b>The</b> building wasnâ€™t damaged in the fire of 1812.
