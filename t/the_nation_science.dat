50|$|Australia's National Science Week is held {{annually}} in August, funded through the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science. National Science Week welcomes {{an audience of}} over a million and hosts more than 1000 events across <b>the</b> <b>nation.</b> <b>Science</b> Week {{provides an opportunity for}} all Australians to participate in events and activities that showcase science and encourages younger people to consider continuing studies in science. Past participants have included polar explorer and environmental scientist Tim Jarvis, NASA Astronaut Katherine Megan McArthur; environmentalist Tanya Ha; theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss; and palaeontologist Scott Sampson. Another key activity during National Science Week is the National Project, which is run in conjunction with ABC Australia. Past project have included Weather Detective in 2014 and the Aussie Star Hunt in 2009. Also in 2009 Cosmos Magazine launched a website called HELLO FROM EARTH which collected over 28,000 messages which were beamed to the first Earth like planet candidate, Gliese 581d. In 2016 it included Wikibomb2016, a project to create missing Wikipedia pages on Australian women scientists.|$|E

5000|$|The {{history of}} the École Polytechnique dates back over 200 years, {{to the time of}} the French Revolution. In 1794, the École {{centrale}} des travaux publics was founded by Lazare Carnot and Gaspard Monge {{at the time of the}} National Convention. It was renamed [...] "École polytechnique" [...] one year later. In 1805, Emperor Napoléon Bonaparte settled the École on Montagne Sainte-Geneviève, in the Quartier Latin, in central Paris (...) , as a military academy and gave its motto Pour la Patrie, les Sciences et la Gloire (For <b>the</b> <b>Nation,</b> <b>science</b> and glory). In 1814, students took part in the Battle of Paris against the Sixth Coalition. In 1830, fifty students participated in the July Revolution. In 1848, Polytechnique students were the leaders of the French Revolution of 1848. They were an important part of the post-revolutionary process, with one student (Charles de Freycinet) becoming part of the post-revolution government. They were given the right to wear a sword as a recognition of their role. During the First World War, students were mobilized and the school building was transformed into a hospital. More than two hundred students were killed fighting for France during the war. During the Second World War, Polytechnique was moved away to Lyon in the free zone. More than four hundred Polytechnicians were killed during the war, as part of Free French and French Resistance operations, or in Nazi camps. In 1970, the École becomes a state-supported civilian institution, under the auspices of the Ministry of Defence. In 1972, women were admitted for the first time. In 1976, the École moved from Paris to Palaiseau (approx 25 km from Paris) In 1985, the École started awarding PhD degrees. In 1994, celebration of the bicentennial was chaired by President François Mitterrand. In 2000, a new cursus was set in place, passing to four years and reforming the polytechnicien curriculum. In 2005, the École started awarding master's degrees. In 2007, it became a founding member of UniverSud Paris and ParisTech. In December 2014, it became a founding member of Université Paris-Saclay.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} matrix {{approach}} to the computation of Battle-Lemari'e's wavelets. Since the Fourier transform of the scaling function {{is the product of}} the inverse F (x) of a square root of a positive trigonometric polynomial and the Fourier transform of a b-spline of order m. The polynomial is the symbol of an bi-infinite matrix B associated with b-spline of order 2 m. We approximate B 2 m by its finite section AN, a square matrix of finite order. We use AN to compute an approximation xN of F (x). We show that xN converges to x pointwise exponentially fast. This gives a feasible method to compute the scaling function for any given tolerance. Similarly, this method can be used to compute the wavelets. AMS(MOS) Subject Classification: Primary 41 A 15, 41 A 30, 42 C 15, 47 B 35.

40|$|A two-step {{approach}} of preparation for SiGe/Si heterogeneous nanostructures, which combined with ultra-high vacuum chemical deposition and electrochemical anodization techniques, is demonstrated. Uniformly distributed nanostructures with a quite uniform distribution of size and morphology are obtained. A strong room-temperature photoluminescence from the nanostructures was observed {{with a narrow}} full-width at half-maximum of around 110 meV. The possible origins of the two main peaks at around 1. 6 and 1. 8 eV have been discussed in detail.
