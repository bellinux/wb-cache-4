5|$|As {{a result}} of the 1973 oil crisis, {{combined}} with the growing influence of Third World alignments such as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the Non-Aligned Movement, less-powerful countries had more room to assert their independence and often showed themselves resistant <b>to</b> <b>pressure</b> from either superpower. Meanwhile, Moscow was forced to turn its attention inward to deal with the Soviet Union's deep-seated domestic economic problems. During this period, Soviet leaders such as Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin embraced the notion of détente.|$|E

Tenney later retracted his offer due <b>to</b> <b>pressure</b> from MLB players. Defensively, he led the majors in errors committed by a first baseman and finished second in most putouts for any position. Tenney led the 1906 Beaneaters to a 49–102 record.

40|$|Calcic {{plagioclase}} single crystals {{were subjected}} to shock loading up <b>to</b> a <b>pressure</b> of 496 kbar; optical and electron microscope studies were conducted to investigate the shock-induced effects on the mineral, which is found in terrestrial and lunar rocks and in meteorites. It was observed that up <b>to</b> 287 kbar <b>pressure,</b> the recovered samples are essentially crystalline, while samples subjected <b>to</b> <b>pressures</b> between 300 and 400 kbar are almost 100 % diaplectic glasses, suggesting shock transformation in the solid state. Samples shock-loaded <b>to</b> <b>pressures</b> greater than 400 kbar yielded glasses with refractive indices {{similar to those of}} thermally fused glass. It is concluded that planar features, absent in all the specimens, may not be definitive shock indicators, but may be linked to local heterogeneous dynamic stresses experienced by plagioclase grains within shocked rocks...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a {{brief review of}} experimental techniques for producing dynamic isentropic compression of samples <b>to</b> <b>pressures</b> of several hundred GPa. Traditional gun launch techniques include use of buffer plates, such as fused silica, that exhibit negative curvature to their stress-strain response and graded-density impactors. Graded-density impactors have been used to study isentropic compression of specimens <b>to</b> <b>pressures</b> exceeding 2 Mbar on high-impedance materials. A recent development includes the use of the Sandia Z Accelerator to produce magnetic compression in planar specimens <b>to</b> <b>pressures</b> of a few hundred kbar over time scales of 100 ns. These techniques have been successfully applied to isentropic compression of iron to 300 kbar and copper to 130 kbar. The iron results indicate {{that it is possible to}} study the polymorphic phase change that occurs at 130 kbar and also the kinetic properties of the transformation. The copper results indicate that with further improvements in progress it should be possible to measure continuous isentropic compression curves in materials of interest <b>to</b> <b>pressures</b> exceeding 1 Mbar. The Z accelerator is limited to peak currents of about 20 MA. By reconfiguring the anode-cathode geometry it should be possible to obtain constant current density and thus driving <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> about 3 Mbar. The next generation accelerator referred to as ZX, which is being proposed will have the capability to generate currents to 50 MA and resulting peak <b>pressures</b> <b>to</b> 15 Mbar...|$|R
