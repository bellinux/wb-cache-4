5|$|Narihira {{was not a}} {{profound}} poet. His surviving poems are mainly occasional, and even when the expression suggests deeply felt emotion, its worldly manner keeps his poetry from attaining <b>the</b> <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best Man'yōshū poems in the same vein. He is nevertheless of historical importance as one who maintained {{the traditions of the}} waka during the long night of the dominance of poetry in Chinese.|$|E
5|$|The Abercromby baronets owned a {{significant}} amount of property in Ireland, as most of the town of Fermoy had been purchased by them from John Anderson in the early 19th century. By 1814 Forglen was used as the main family seat of the Abercromby family; in 1877 they also acquired Dunlugas House, which was sited {{on the other side of}} the River Deveron. Lady Jane Abercromby's son, Sir Robert Abercromby, 5th Baronet, continued to enhance <b>the</b> <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> estate policies by commissioning the building of a new mansion and several other buildings.|$|E

"Dwarrowdelf": This {{theme is}} much more grand and {{emotional}} than the other Moria themes, but it is minor and melancholic, representing <b>the</b> ruined <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dwarves.

5|$|Building {{began in}} 1909, using oak from the estate, {{metalwork}} from local blacksmiths, and stone quarried locally, {{brought to the}} site by a private railway line. Barnsley insisted that no machines would be used, so instead of using a saw powered by steam engine, the wood was hand-sawn in a saw pit. The east wing was completed by 1915, and the Biddulphs moved into them, with the reception rooms finished around the same time. Despite <b>the</b> <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building, the Biddulph's lived in some small rooms and fitted the large reception rooms for community use. Biddulph also built some cottages {{at the site of}} the old manor house at Rodmarton around the same time.|$|E
25|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new monuments, {{the center}} of the city at the {{beginning}} of the 18th century was overcrowded, dark, unhealthy, and had little light, air, or drinking water. It was also dangerous, despite the addition of the first metal lanterns on the main streets and the enlargement of the police night watch to four hundred men.|$|E
25|$|Above the doorways are {{classical}} Ionic order columns that ostensibly {{hold up the}} frieze and pediment. Uncommon for Ionic order columns is {{the lack}} of fluting, which is usually used to draw the eye upward, increasing <b>the</b> <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> facade. The numerous projections and recessions on the façade attribute to the planar quality of the building, while also creating interesting shading and lighting patterns on the stone and within the building.|$|E
50|$|After <b>the</b> death <b>of</b> Louis XIV in 1715, <b>the</b> aristocrats <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French court {{abandoned}} <b>the</b> <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> Versailles for <b>the</b> {{more intimate}} townhouses of Paris where, elegantly attired, they could play and flirt {{and put on}} scenes from the Italian commedia dell'arte.|$|R

50|$|Evaluated and {{modified}} several times {{by a special}} commission, the plans finally shelved owing to <b>the</b> sheer <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project. Although Napoleon was strongly behind it, it was finally deemed too ambitious for a city <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> Milan. <b>The</b> Foro Bonaparte plans were however not completely abandoned: once Antolini's design had been set aside, the project was entrusted to Luigi Canonica who completely reworked it into developing the area essentially for private residences.|$|R
25|$|Sam and Joe Meyer, who had {{previously}} been successful in the grocery business, became determined to build a hotel to express <b>the</b> <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> growing city. In 1927 they built the eleven-story (then considered a skyscraper) Lamar Hotel, {{on the corner of}} 5th Street and 21st Avenue. The hotel was named after Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar II, a former U.S. Senator from Mississippi, cabinet member, and member of the Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|During this period, rulers often {{embarked}} on ambitious attempts at redesigning their capital cities as a showpiece for <b>the</b> <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation. Disasters were often a major catalyst for planned reconstruction. An {{exception to this}} was in London after the Great Fire of 1666 when, despite many radical rebuilding schemes from architects such as John Evelyn and Christopher Wren, no large-scale redesigning was achieved due to the complexities of rival ownership claims. However, improvements were made in hygiene and fire safety with wider streets, stone construction {{and access to the}} river.|$|E
25|$|From 1838 to 1851, Thon was {{employed}} in {{construction of the}} Neo-Russian Grand Kremlin Palace and the Kremlin Armoury in Moscow. The grandiose palace, famed for opulent interiors of its 700 rooms and halls, was meant to symbolize <b>the</b> <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russian state. It was a daring design which incorporated parts of earlier structures that had been standing on the spot. The palace has served successively as an official residence for the Russian tsars, Soviet rulers, and the Presidents of the Russian Federation. At the same time, Thon rehabilitated the abandoned Izmaylovo Estate into an almshouse for the veterans of the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
50|$|As {{you drive}} past <b>the</b> Mughal Gardens <b>of</b> Achabal, {{you will come}} across the picturesque Daksum Situated amidst <b>the</b> {{magnificent}} <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kokarnag springs, it presents an awe-inspiring sight. Standing {{at an altitude of}} 2438 m in a densely forested gorge, Daksum offers peace and tranquility. The only sound heard there is that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bringhi River, rushing right through its center. Daksum in Kashmir valley is a must for those fond of walking and nature.|$|R
5|$|In 1985, Jarre {{was invited}} by <b>the</b> musical {{director}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Houston Grand Opera {{to perform a}} concert celebrating Texas's 150th anniversary on 5 April 1986. Although he was busy with other projects and was at first unimpressed by the proposal, on a later visit to the city, he was immediately impressed by <b>the</b> visual <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's skyline and agreed to perform. Also, 1985 marked <b>the</b> 25th anniversary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foundation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center; and NASA asked Jarre to integrate the anniversary into the concert.|$|R
25|$|In the 1990s, {{the current}} Pennsylvania Station was renovated by Amtrak, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and New Jersey Transit, to improve <b>the</b> {{appearance}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> waiting and concession areas, sharpen the station information systems (audio and visual) and remove much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grime. Recalling <b>the</b> erstwhile <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bygone Penn Station, an old four-sided clock {{from the original}} depot was installed at the 34th Street Long Island Rail Road entrance. The walkway from that entrance's escalator also has a mural depicting elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old Penn Station's architecture.|$|R
25|$|By {{the time}} the first European {{settlers}} arrived in the area, smallpox had already spread to the region, decimating Native American populations. The first European settler to homestead in the area was Hale Tharp, who famously built a home out of a hollowed-out fallen giant sequoia log in the Giant Forest next to Log Meadow. Tharp allowed his cattle to graze the meadow, {{but at the same}} time had a respect for <b>the</b> <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forest and led early battles against logging in the area. From time to time, Tharp received visits from John Muir, who would stay at Tharp's log cabin. Tharp's Log can still be visited today in its original location in the Giant Forest.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{mansion and}} its handsomely {{landscaped}} grounds served {{to match the}} impressive scale of the estate, which at 1,700 acres was unusually large by Valley standards. The wide, spacious lawn, dotted with large tress, slopes gently towards a spring-fed brook that arises {{on the grounds of}} the estate less than a mile away and meanders gently towards Smith Creek, which also runs through the estate. Smith Creek was used to power the plantation's mill, which produced flour and other products that were transported up and down the Great Wagon Road. The estate remained in the Moore family until 1879, when Oscar Fitz Allen Moore, grandson of Reuben Moore, Jr., sold the estate to William C. & George H. Harrison.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} direct routes {{begin at}} either end of the Walna Scar Road, making for the summit from the top of the pass. Ascents can be made from Seathwaite Tarn (pathless) or to the north of Goat's Hawse, but these give no clue to <b>the</b> <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crag on the eastern side of the ridge. For this the walker will leave the Walna Scar Road at The Cove, or climb to this point from Torver. From here Goat's Water is the next objective for a stunning view of Dow Crag. Two choices now present themselves- easy via Goat's Hause, or steep via the South Rake (see below). Many walkers will also reach the fell using the good paths from The Old Man of Coniston and Brim Fell.|$|E
50|$|As the Renaissance {{advanced}} {{through all}} of Europe and with it religious music from the monasteries, devotional music became a key part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eucharistic liturgy. To further enhance <b>the</b> spectacular <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cathedral a visually impressive ritual was provided in which music has <b>the</b> mission <b>of</b> embracing <b>the</b> architectural work and amplifying <b>the</b> glorification <b>of</b> God. Since 1440, polyphonic vocal pieces spread rapidly throughout Castile and Aragon. Instrumental music was produced by the organ, which soon found {{a place in the}} cathedrals and <b>the</b> churches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Archpriests.|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to its history galleries, the Haggin Museum displays fine art of late 19th and early 20th century artists such as Jean Béraud, Albert Bierstadt, Rosa Bonheur, William Bouguereau, Paul Gauguin, Jean-Léon Gérôme, Childe Hassam, George Inness, Daniel Ridgway Knight, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Jehan-Georges Vibert, and Jules Worms. It also hosts temporary touring exhibitions and owns important works by late 19th and early 20th century artists. Notable among them are paintings by Albert Bierstadt, whose interpretations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> natural <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sierra Nevada, Yosemite Valley, and other California landscapes are internationally renowned [...]|$|R
50|$|As {{a tourist}} site, the ruins are {{particularly}} {{known for the}} beautiful view out over the East China Sea, for <b>the</b> impressive <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle walls, and for <b>the</b> overall amount <b>of</b> space {{taken up by the}} castle grounds. Hokuzan in general was characterized by wider spaces, or at least less dense settlement and population, than Nanzan and Chūzan, the other kingdoms on the island at that time. Nakijin is also consistently among the first places in the country to see, and celebrate, <b>the</b> blooming <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cherry blossoms (sakura) each year.|$|R
25|$|A major {{attraction}} of the center, {{not far from the}} square, is a manor house that belonged to the former Tlalpan Hacienda. The manor was constructed in 1737 around a central courtyard. Although the hacienda no longer exists, the structure is still surrounded by large gardens. The manor house is currently used as a luxury hotel and restaurant, although there are various salons available as well for events. When it was converted to its present use, it was remodeled in “Neo-Mexican” look with touches of Art Nouveau. The main restaurant offers traditional Mexican dishes with chiles en nogada, cabrito (roast goat), escamoles and duck as specialties. It has large gardens filled with peacocks. Much of the interior décor has been modeled in styles from the 19th century and earlier to evoke <b>the</b> <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area's upper class of that time.|$|E
25|$|The Qing {{emperors}} {{were generally}} adept at poetry and often skilled in painting, and offered their patronage to Confucian culture. The Kangxi and Qianlong Emperors, for instance, embraced Chinese traditions both {{to control them}} and to proclaim their own legitimacy. The Kangxi Emperor sponsored the Peiwen Yunfu, a rhyme dictionary published in 1711, and the Kangxi Dictionary published in 1716, which remains to this day an authoritative reference. The Qianlong Emperor sponsored the largest collection of writings in Chinese history, the Siku Quanshu, completed in 1782. Court painters made new versions of the Song masterpiece, Zhang Zeduan's Along the River During the Qingming Festival whose depiction of a prosperous and happy realm demonstrated the beneficence of the emperor. The emperors undertook tours {{of the south and}} commissioned monumental scrolls to depict <b>the</b> <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> occasion. Imperial patronage also encouraged the industrial production of ceramics and Chinese export porcelain. Peking glassware became popular after European glass making processes were introduced by Jesuits to Beijing.|$|E
25|$|Pollokshields Church of Scotland {{was built}} as Pollokshields Established Church by Robert Baldie in 1877–1878. The {{architecture}} is mixed Gothic with an early English tower with tabernacles above the broaches of the spire at the southwest {{comer of the}} building. The tower has a clock face on each of its four sides. The south (entrance) front has a large geometrical window above a row of trefoil headed windows with stiff leaf capitals. The side aisles have twin lancet windows beneath the clerestory of triple lancet windows to the main church. The interior has aisle arcades formed by polished granite columns on high octagonal sandstone bases with French Gothic capitals supporting pointed arches beneath the clerestory windows and the high scissor braced roof trusses. Each column cap is different The timber roof of the side aisles and the main trusses add to <b>the</b> <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interior. The south balcony is reached by a staircase from the east porch. The deep chancel was remodelled in 1912–1914 with new organ, pulpit and communion table.|$|E
25|$|While <b>the</b> {{architecture}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> campus at Fu Tei is modelled on {{the original}} in Guangzhou, it has also incorporated novelties with black, white and grey schemes forming its unique colour spectrum. <b>The</b> <b>grandeur</b> and solemnity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> campus building suggest qualities of perseverance and determination.|$|R
2500|$|World War II {{determined}} Paul Wild's specialisation and intruded to foreshorten {{his entire}} university life to only five terms. In 1942, Wild went to <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> Cambridge (Peterhouse) to further his mathematics. However, {{after a year}} of mathematics he knew that he would only be able to stay on if he did something relevant to the national war effort. Thus he went straight into [...] "physics with radio": Part 2 Physics. He saidthe great majority of people in Part 2 Physics had already done two years of it before, so it was a real challenge. But I enjoyed it very much, and I was very inspired by <b>the</b> sort <b>of</b> <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> approach, <b>the</b> wonders <b>of</b> quantum mechanics and relativity …. It was hard work, it was six days a week. That's how I became a physicist.|$|R
50|$|Fête galante {{paintings}} {{are an important}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rococo period <b>of</b> art, which saw <b>the</b> focus <b>of</b> European arts move away from <b>the</b> hierarchical, standardized <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church and royal court and toward an appreciation for intimacy and personal pleasures. Nonetheless, the lush, outdoor settings of fête galante paintings were often mined from earlier paintings, especially from Venetian paintings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 16th century and Dutch paintings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 17th century.|$|R
25|$|The Empress Joséphine {{had her own}} {{favorite}} composer, the Italian Gaspare Spontini, {{who became}} her official composer of both historical dramas and comedies. Spontini's first lyrical work, La vestale, had a considerable success. His next work, Fernand Cortez, was commissioned when Napoleon decided to invade Spain, and celebrated the conquest of Mexico by Hernán Cortés. Unfortunately, the French army was defeated in Spain and Fernand Cortez was pulled from the repertoire, but it made a great impression on other French composers with its grand scenic effects, a Mexican ballet and a cavalry charge, its use of drums, and its huge chorus. Napoleon recreated <b>the</b> <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earlier royal court, constructing a new theater at the Tuileries Palace, which was finished in 1808. He also brought together an exceptional troupe of musicians and singers from Italy, including the composer Ferdinando Paër, who became master of his household music, the castrato Girolamo Crescentini, and the contralto Giuseppina Grassini. Napoleon did not allow applause in the hall during performances. The orchestra played a special air by André Grétry when Napoleon entered the theater, and the Vivat Imperator when he departed. But, because of his military campaigns, he was rarely in Paris to enjoy them.|$|E
500|$|Today, {{little remains}} of <b>the</b> <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old city. The three capitals, Fustat, Al-Askar and Al-Qatta'i were {{absorbed into the}} growing city of Cairo.

2500|$|The Roller {{directives}} are infamous for emphasizing <b>the</b> supposed <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union under Stalin, {{but also}} for praising Tsarist Russia and the Slavic peoples. The other ideas emphasized included <b>the</b> condemnation <b>of</b> other foreigners, particularly Westerners, starting with Ancient Rome—the French, Italian and American libraries were shut down, their patrons arrested; condemnation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> formerly dominant boyars ("traitors" [...] to the Ottomans) and bourgeoisie ("cosmopolitan" [...] and [...] "serving imperialist capitalists"); and minimization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> role played by historic Romanian figures. Described by traditionalist historians as Romania's war of national unity, World War I was treated by Roller and other Marxist-Leninists as an [...] "imperialist war".
