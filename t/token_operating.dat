50|$|An {{individual}} who possesses token status {{can have a}} very affected career experience. Kanter hypothesizes that oftentimes, the token’s experience is less related to whatever attribute makes them a token and more so influenced by the structural restraints that are intrinsic to the positions they fill. To elaborate, the positions held by tokens are generally lacking in power and the opportunity for advancement. Additionally, <b>tokens</b> <b>operating</b> within workplaces with skewed ratios that result in them being extremely outnumbered are “often treated as representations of their category, as symbols rather than individuals”. Tokens are also extremely visible and subject to scrutiny due to their evident contrast from the majority. This can create large amounts of pressure to perform well; tokens will often either respond to this with overachievement or underachievement, both of which make further advancement difficult. More often than not, token status often leads to “demotivation, lower levels of performance, and diminished aspirations for the future”.|$|R

NFC authentication works when closer than one foot (.3 meters). The NFC protocol bridges short distances to reader while the Bluetooth connection serves for data provision with token both to enable authentication. Also when the Bluetooth link is not connected, the token may serve the locally stored authentication information in coarse positioning to NFC reader and relieves from exact positioning to a connector.|$|R

This replaced a system of paper tickets, <b>token</b> (coin) <b>operated</b> turnstiles and flash periodical passes (including the existing TravelPass range). State Transit installed ticket vending machines and ticket barriers at Circular Quay and Manly, the main wharves in its network.

40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{to reconfigure}} a fault-tolerant double-loop token-ring {{local area network}} following topological changes is presented. The algorithm guarantees that at all operational times the net-work is organized to provide maximum possible connectivity among the nodes- either one loop that encompasses all nodes in the network or several subloops each of which operates as a separate token ring network. Tokens are generated or eliminated as necessary to result in one and only one token in each (sub) loop. The algorithm is formally specified and its properties are verified. Token ring is a well known architecture for local area networks (LANs) which is preferred by many over the bus architecture because of its inherent advantages: 1. High speed- a <b>token</b> ring can <b>operate</b> at speeds of hundreds of Mbps which are much higher than is practical for bus LANs...|$|R
40|$|The {{value of}} token {{reinforcement}} in the instatement and shaping of fluency was examined in an intensive treatment program for adult stutterers. Experiment 1 examined {{the effect of}} removing the tangible back-up reinforcers for the token system and found that clients' performance in the program was equally good with or without these back-up reinforcers, suggesting that a strict token economy may not be crucial to rapid progress through treatment. Experiment 2 compared contingent and noncontingent taken reinforcement, while controlling for some variables that may have confounded the results of earlier research, and found no difference in clients' performance. Experiment 3 examined {{the effect of the}} entire removal of token reinforcement. Performance was found to be no worse under a "no tokens" system than under a system of tokens with back-up reinforcers. It is argued that in a highly structured treatment program where many other reinforcers are <b>operating,</b> <b>token</b> reinforcement may be largely redundant. Clinical and theoretical implications of the findings are discussed...|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of IBM-implemented (actual) passive <b>Token</b> ring MAUs <b>operated</b> without {{the requirement of}} power; instead the passive MAU used a series of relays that adjusted themselves as data is passed through: this is also why Token ring generally used relays to terminate disconnected or failed ports. The power-less IBM 8228 Multistation Access Unit requires a special 'Setup Aid' tool to re-align the relays after the unit has been moved which causes them to be in incorrect states: this is accomplished by a 9v battery sending a charge to snap the relays back in a proper state. The advantages of having a MAU operate without power {{is that they can}} be placed in areas without outlets, the disadvantage is that they must be primed each time the internal relays experience excessive force. The IBM 8226 MAU, while containing a power jack, primarily uses this for the LEDs: relays are still used inside the unit but do not require priming.|$|R
40|$|Local area {{networks}} {{are representative of}} a growing class of distributed systems which demand more sophisticated methods and tools to evaluate system behavior {{in the presence of}} faults. In particular, since they are likely to exhibit degradable performance, the concept of performability can provide more refined assessments of their ability to perform under fault and error conditions. This paper presents the results of a detailed performability evaluation of a network employing the IEEE 802. 4 protocol. In particular, a 30 -station IEEE 802. 4 <b>token</b> bus network <b>operating</b> in a hostile factory environment is evaluated using stochastic activity etwo'ks. Stochastic activity networks, a generalization of stochastic Petri nets, provide a convenient representation for computer networks and are formal enough to permit solution by both analysis and simulation. The evaluation results show 1) that stochastic activity {{networks are}} an appropriate model type for evaluating the performability of local area networks and 2) that the protocol is extremely tolerant to transient faults such as token losses and noise bursts under moderate network loads...|$|R
50|$|Until World War II, New Zealand's {{air force}} {{concentrated}} on training, transport and maritime attack. The vast {{distance of the}} Pacific Ocean seemed a defence against attack by air. Until 1938, {{only a handful of}} record breaking air flights had flown to New Zealand, where they were required to land and refuel, suggesting that an enemy attack could not both get to, attack, and then return from a mission to New Zealand. The New Zealand Permanent Air Force <b>operated</b> <b>token</b> numbers of Bristol Fighters and Gloster Grebes. As far as operations overseas went, it was assumed New Zealand would be embedded within Britain's Royal Air Force. In Europe, this was the case. During the 1930s New Zealanders joined the RAF through RAF scholarships and short service commissions, like the first RAF ace of WWII, 'Cobber' Kain. In the opening years of World War II, the RNZAF produced many pilots for the RAF, including fighter pilots. Many New Zealanders trained in Canada for the RAF with the Empire Air Training Scheme. Nos 485(NZ), 486(NZ) fighter squadrons fought in Europe. There were however no fighter units in New Zealand itself when war broke out with Japan.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} an incentive-based {{trust model}} to let wireless spectrum regulation embrace diverse {{current and future}} means of implementing cognitive radio. Cognitive radio {{has emerged as a}} way to combat inefficient spectrum use by allowing independently designed networks to share the same frequency band. This philosophy has been embraced by the FCC, which has already allowed cognitive use in the TV bands, and plans to make spectrum sharing the norm in other bands as well. To enact spectrum sharing, regulatory decisions, like band assignment, are made at runtime so that they can reflect local context. From a regulatory perspective, the most important question is how to trust that these decisions will be made and carried out correctly. Right now, the FCC guarantees correct decisions by directly testing that any deployed technologies are incapable of making bad decisions. This process of testing is called certification. But certification has limitations. For example, a network of nodes could sense for a TV signal and decide as a group that the TV tower is far enough away that their interference to TV receivers would be negligible. However, this network will never pass a certification test. There is no way to prove that the network will stay silent if all the nodes are blocked by the same building so they cannot sense the tower but can cause interference. This thesis provides a new model for trust that would allow networked sensing and any other novel spectrum sharing solution through light-handed regulations. The idea is to build a system that allows regulators to trust secondaries to follow sharing rules regardless of whether they are technically capable of finding spectrum holes. This is accomplished by an incentive mechanism, a spectrum jail, that will punish secondaries caught causing interference by degrading their quality of service. This thesis shows that for such a mechanism to work, cognitive radio must {{be thought of as a}} band-expander. If the same mechanism must apply to all radios, regardless of technology, there must be pretty good unlicensed or licensed bands that secondaries can use if they cannot share spectrum appropriately. The mechanism explored here is inspired by the ideas in the law and economics literature as well as the spectrum policy literature. This thesis takes these mostly rhetorical arguments and develops the first mathematical model for incentive-based trust in spectrum regulation. This model allows identification of the most difficult to enforce cases: the regulator must decide whether a primary will be protected even if it hardly ever uses its band. The regulator must also decide what constitutes harmful interference. Some interference is unavoidable when bands are shared; the regulator must decide how much interference the primary must accept in a shared environment. When these decisions are made, this thesis shows that trust can be guaranteed with a sanction set at certification time and which is applied to all cognitive devices regardless of technology. The model also gives quantitative performance metrics, measuring the ability for secondaries to reclaim spectrum holes, which illustrate the dependence on the regulator's ability to catch wrongdoers. In particular, this thesis shows that while trust depends on the ability to catch those causing interference, runtime performance depends on the wrongful conviction rate. So, even applying the same sanction, as spectrum sharing technology and catching technology improves, performance will improve as well. This model is extended to understand what role the primary can or must play in its own protection as new primary devices are developed to operate in a shared band. By controlling the cost of reporting, the regulator can trust a primary to report interference correctly. This also means that if a secondary is difficult to coexist with, the primary will not use the jail system to try to get rid of the secondary. It will instead hire a ``band-sitter,'' which is a preferred secondary system that coexists more easily with the primary. This thesis also addresses multiple secondaries and aggregate interference by giving a basic framework of results to guide research in this direction. The distribution of aggregate interference from randomly placed nodes is explored to understand placement risk: the threat of too much interference caused by clusters of secondaries too close to the primary. Then, the thesis develops strategies to use the secondary location information that TV whitespace databases already have to address the problem of placement risk. Finally, a basic queuing model is suggested as a future direction to extend spectrum jails to deal with multiple secondaries. Finally, this thesis answers the question of why jails? The original motivation is two-fold. First, jails lend themselves to simple modeling because the utility and the sanction are both measured in quality of service terms. Second, jails can actually be reasonably implemented. The FCC has allowed TV whitespace devices using databases to coordinate spectrum access. In order to actually secure this operation, databases will need to be able to identify malfunctioning devices and turn them off. These same identity and kill-switch technologies will also enable spectrum jails. Jails can even be implemented through the databases themselves as a denial of <b>operating</b> <b>tokens.</b> At a more philosophical level, in-kind and monetary sanctions are fundamentally different things. Which one is actually better suited to the spectrum sharing enforcement problem? The last chapter will apply the same performance-based understanding from the the rest of the thesis to understand when fines or in-kind punishments should be preferred. It shows that in cases of high uncertainty, or when primary protection is the most important consideration, in-kind sanctions are the right approach...|$|R
