These assays were performed at two different periods: July-August and October. Efficacy was evaluated 10 days after treatment and the residual activity (persistence) during 5 days (1 st assay) and 7 days (2 nd assay). In greenhouse, a reduction of 97. 7 % and 91. 7 % on H. armigera population (artificial infestation) and fruit damage rates of 15. 8 % and 13. 7 % were observed in the experimental plots treated with spinosad and B. thuringiensis, respectively. The mortality on H. armigera larvae caused by B. thuringiensis ranged between 41. 7 % and 58. 3 % (1 st assay) and between 48. 9 % and 100. 0 % (2 nd assay) along the days observation period, while for spinosad ranged between 85. 7 % and 100. 0 % in both persistence assays. There was also an abnormal evolution on the persistence of B. thuringiensis in the 2 nd assay since the induced mortality in these repetitions increased along the observation period.

40|$|Antimicrobial {{peptides}} (AMPs) {{are small}} peptides {{with less than}} 50 amino acids and {{are part of the}} innate immune response in almost all organisms, including bacteria, vertebrates, invertebrates and plants. AMPs are active against a broad-spectrum of pathogens. The inducible expression of AMPs in plants is a promising approach to combat plant pathogens with minimal negative side effects, such as phytotoxicity or infertility. In this study, inducible expression of the de-novo designed AMP SP 1 - 1 in Micro Tom <b>tomato</b> <b>protected</b> tomato fruits against bacterial spot disease caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria. The peptide SP 1 - 1 was targeted to the apoplast which is the primary infection site for plant pathogens, by fusing SP 1 - 1 peptide to the signal peptide RsAFP 1 of radish (Raphanus sativus). The pathogen inducibility of the expression was enabled by using an optimized inducible 4 XW 2 / 4 XS promoter. As a result, the tomato fruits of independently generated SP 1 - 1 transgenic lines were significantly more resistant to X. campestris pv. vesicatoria than WT tomato fruits. In transgenic lines, bacterial infection was reduced up to 65 % in comparison to the infection of WT plants. Our study demonstrates that the combination of the 4 XW 2 / 4 XS cis-element from parsley with the synthetic antimicrobial peptide SP 1 - 1 is a good alternative to protect tomato fruits against infections with X. campestris pv. vesicatoria...|$|E
40|$|For _ 20 yr, Bemisia tabaci Gennadius {{persists}} as a begomovirus vector and is {{a serious}} problem in tomato production {{in many parts of the}} world. In tropical countries, the use of netting to protect horticultural crops has proven to be an effective and sustainable tool against Lepidoptera but not against small insects. This study evaluated the repellent effect of AgroNet 0. 9 T, a 0. 9 -mm pore diameter and 40 -mesh size netting treated with alphacypermethrin insecticide against B. tabaci. This pyrethroid insecticide is known to have toxic and repellent effects against mosquitoes and has been used for treatment of mosquito nets. Two nontreated netting materials were used as control: AgroNet 0. 9 NT with 0. 9 -mm pore diameter and 40 -mesh size and AgroNet 0. 4 NT with 0. 4 -mm pore diameter and 80 -mesh size. The behavior of B. tabaci and its parasitoid Encarsia formosa Gahan as they progressed through the treated netting was studied in the laboratory in choice and no-choice tests. The development of wild B. tabaci population on tomato plants protected by the same nets was followed in two Þeld trials implemented in Njoro, Kenya. Results obtained with the no-choice tests showed a signiÞcant reduction of movement on the treated net with 40 -mesh (19 %) compared with nontreated netting (35 and 46 % with 80 - and 40 -mesh, respectively). The mortality of B. tabaci was signiÞcantly higher (two-fold) in the test tube containing only the treated netting compared with the nontreated one. The repellent effect of the treated netting was also demonstrated against E. formosa, but it did not have this toxic effect. Unlike for B. tabaci, the treated and nontreated nets appeared to have a similar repellent effect on E. formosa in the choice test, which suggests a learning behavior of the parasitoid. In both Þeld tests, B. tabaci population was signiÞcantly lower on <b>tomato</b> <b>protected</b> by the treated net compared with the same nontreated net. However there was no signiÞcant difference in B. tabaci population between the treated 0. 9 -pore diameter and the nontreated 0. 4 -pore diameter. We discussed these Þndings and their implications for the use of repellent netting in integrated pest management in horticulture and more specifically in vegetable production. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

40|$|Insect-proof nets {{are thought}} to be {{effective}} physical barriers to <b>protect</b> <b>tomato</b> crops against several insect pests, including the invasive tomato pest, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae). However, <b>protected</b> <b>tomato</b> crops are frequently infested by this destructive pest, and there is a higher infestation of plants closer to openings in Mediterranean greenhouses, suggesting that immigrating adults can easily walk on these protective materials {{and find a way to}} reach the crop. Laboratory bioassays were carried out to characterize the potential toxicity of a -cypermethrin-treated insect-proof nets (Agronet) against T. absoluta adults. The data showed that the net acts mainly through a variety of chronic sublethal effects rather than acute ones. Reduced longevity and, more markedly, a reduced number of laid eggs were observed after the moths were exposed to the treated net over the du- ration of their lifetimes. A Y-tube experiment showed that the treated net does not affect the T. absoluta olfaction cues for host location. In contrast, when the moths were given the option to choose either the treated or the untreated net in laboratory cages, they significantly preferred the untreated one.

30|$|Flower {{diameter}} and disc diameter in the gerbera treated with biocontrol agent at monthly interval were maximum than untreated control, {{indicating that the}} bacterial strain increased the flower size due to growth promotion and disease reduction. Production of surfactin is prevalent among B. subtilis and B. amyloliquefaciens which assists in cell attachment and detachment to surfaces during the formation of biofilm and in swarming motility (Raaijmakers et al., 2010). Similarly, in the present study, application of Bacillus species with antibiotic genes including surfactin might have helped in the attachment of all the strains of Bacillus and resulted in the multiplication of the bacteria in rhizosphere leading to the biofilm formation, thus suppressing the F. oxysporum and M. incognita in gerbera and increasing the plant growth promotion, flower yield, and soil health. Surfactin was also effective against Pseudomonas syringae pv. <b>tomato</b> and <b>protects</b> Arabidopsis thaliana against infection by the pathogen (Bais et al., 2004).

Some studies show that tomatoes and garlic should be taken together {{at the same time}} to have its cancer preventive effects. Whatever it is, we really do not know how or why tomatoes work against cancers. We believe that lycopene and the newly discovered bioflavonoids in tomatoes are responsible as cancer fighting agents. Not only raw tomatoes but also cooked or processed tomato products such as ketchup, sauce, and paste, are counted as good sources of cancer prevention. Tomato is also good for liver health. Tomato has detoxification effect in the body. Probably it is due to the presence of chlorine and sulfur in tomatoes. According to some studies, 51 mg of chlorine and 11 mg of sulfur in 100 grams size of tomato have a vital role in detoxification process. We know that natural chlorine works in stimulating the liver and its function for filtering and detoxifying body wastes. Sulfur in <b>tomatoes</b> <b>protects</b> the liver from cirrhosis, too.

40|$|Background] A binary co-occluded mixture (HearSP 1 B:LB 6) of Helicoverpa armigera single nucleopolyhedrovirus (HearNPV) {{variants}} {{was previously}} {{found to be}} highly pathogenic under laboratory conditions. The insecticidal efficacy and persistence of this mixture were determined in greenhouse and field-grown tomato crops in Spain and Portugal. [Results] Concentrations of 10 - 10 occlusion bodies (OBs) L of HearSP 1 B:LB 6 resulted in 89 - 100 % mortality of larvae on treated tomato plants in growth chambers. In <b>protected</b> <b>tomato</b> crops, application of 10 OBs L of HearSP 1 B:LB 6 was as effective as Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and spinosad in reducing the percentage of damaged fruits, and resulted in higher larval mortality than the Bt treatment. In open-field tomato crops, virus treatments were as effective in reducing the percentage of damaged fruit as spinosad, Bt and chlorpyrifos treatments. The persistence of the insecticides on tomato plants was negatively correlated with solar radiation in both field and greenhouse settings. Residual insecticidal activity of OBs on <b>protected</b> <b>tomato</b> crops at 6 days post-application was 55 and 35 % {{higher than that of}} Bt and spinosad respectively. On field-grown tomato, OB persistence was significantly lower than with spinosad or chlorpyrifos.

To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying hexanoic acid-induced resistance (Hx-IR), {{we compared the}} expression profiles of three different conditions: Botrytis-infected plants (Inf), Hx-treated plants (Hx) and Hx-treated + infected plants (Hx+Inf). The microarray analysis at 24 [*]h post-inoculation showed that Hx and Hx+Inf plants exhibited the differential expression and priming of many Botrytis-induced genes. Interestingly, {{we found that the}} activation by Hx of other genes was not altered by the fungus at this time point. These genes may be considered to be specific targets of the Hx priming effect and may help to elucidate its mechanisms of action. It is noteworthy that, in Hx and Hx+Inf plants, there was up-regulation of proteinase inhibitor genes, DNA-binding factors, enzymes involved in plant hormone signalling and synthesis, and, remarkably, the genes involved in oxidative stress. Given the relevance of the oxidative burst occurring in plant–pathogen interactions, the effect of Hx on this process was studied in depth. We showed by specific staining that reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in Hx+Inf plants was reduced and more restricted around infection sites. In addition, these plants showed higher ratios of reduced to oxidized glutathione and ascorbate, and normal levels of antioxidant activities.

40|$|As {{mentioned}} in the Introduction, vegetable seed companies have been confronted with the practice, that after production of scions from the seedlings of <b>protected</b> <b>tomato</b> varieties, the remaining stubs are not discarded but sold. In this way, two plants are produced from one seed: a scion for grafting onto a rootstock, and a stub that develops on its own roots into a new complete plant. Both are sold. The involved seed companies disagree with the nurserymen about the legality of this practice. This scientific / technical report provides independent opinions on the meaning and scope of words, such as grafting, production, reproduction, propagation, and multiplication, without giving a legal judgement. Further, this report underlines that it is technically feasible to trace the genetic identity of scions, stubs and rootstocks, also after grafting, and compare these with genetic identities of protected plant varieties. The aim of this report is to provide clarity about meanings and scopes of keywords, {{and in this way}} serve the involved parties to solve this issue in a legitimate way...|$|R
40|$|Cyantraniliprole {{is a novel}} {{insecticide}} {{for control}} of multiple chewing and sucking insect pest species including the sweetpotato whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius), {{which is one of}} the most important polyphagous pests in tropical, subtropical, and Mediterranean regions. This study aims to evaluate the effects of cyantraniliprole on the probing behavior of B. tabaci on tomato. Electrical penetration graph data indicated that on plants treated with cyantraniliprole (foliar application), adult whiteflies of the genetic variant Q 2 were not able to reach the phloem and consequently did not perform the activities represented by E 1 and E 2 waveforms, i. e., phloem salivation (during which inoculation of geminiviruses occurs) and phloem sap ingestion (during which geminiviruses are acquired by the whiteflies), respectively. The complete failure of B. tabaci biotype Q adults to feed from the phloem of tomato plants treated with cyantraniliprole could be explained by rapid cessation of ingestion because of the mode of action of this insecticide. Overall, these findings indicated that cyantraniliprole might represent a useful new tool for producers to <b>protect</b> <b>tomato</b> plants from damage by B. tabaci...|$|R
40|$|Thirty {{endophytic}} bacteria {{were isolated}} from various plant species growing near Saint-Petersburg, Russia. Based on a screening for various traits, including plant-beneficial properties and DNA fragment pat-terns, potential siblings were removed. The remaining isolates were taxonomically identified using 16 S rDNA sequences and potential human and plant pathogens were removed. The remaining strains were tested {{for their ability}} to promote radish root growth and to <b>protect</b> <b>tomato</b> plants against tomato foot and root rot. One strain, Bacillus subtilis HC 8, isolated from the giant hogweed Heracleum sosnowskyi Manden, significantly promoted plant growth and pro-tected tomato against tomato foot and root rot. Metabolites possibly responsible for these plant-beneficial properties were identified as the hormone gibberellin and (lipo) peptide antibiotics respectively. The antibiotic properties of strain HC 8 {{are similar to those of}} the commercially available plant-beneficial strain Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB 42. However, thin layer chromatography profiles of the two strains differ. It is speculated that endophytes such as B. subtilis HC 8 contribute to the fast growth of giant hogweed...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate in vitro and in vivo biocontrol of bacterial spot (Xanthomonas vesicatoria) and early blight (Alternaria solani) by the epiphytic bacteria Paenibacillus macerans and Bacillus pumilus. Tomato plants were previously sprayed with epiphytic bacteria, benzalkonium chloride and PBS buffer and, after four days, they were inoculated with A. solani and X. vesicatoria. To determine the phytopathogenic bacteria population, leaflet samples were collected from each treatment every 24 hours, for seven days, and plated on semi-selective medium. The effect of epiphytic bacteria over phytopathogens was performed by the antibiosis test and antagonistic activity measured by inhibition zone diameter. The epiphytic and benzalkonium chloride drastically reduced the severity of early blight and bacterial spot {{in comparison to the}} control (PBS). In detached leaflets, the epiphytic bacteria reduced in 70 % the number of phytopathogenic bacteria cells in the phylloplane. The antibiosis test showed that the epiphytic bacteria efficiently inhibit the phytopathogens growth. In all the bioassays, the epiphytic bacteria <b>protect</b> <b>tomato</b> plants against the phytopathogen...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} cypermethrin, {{dimethoate}} and neem extracts were investigated {{during the dry}} and wet periods of 2012 cropping seasons in Samaru, Zaria. The design used was Randomized Complete Research Design. Five treatments were used; Cypermethrin, dimethoate, neem seed extract, neem leaf extract and a control where no insecticidal spray was carried out. The treatments wee replicated four times. Parameters recorded were, number of holed tomato fruits, number of damaged tomato fruits, weight of tomato fruits and size of tomato fruits. The result of the experiment indicated that plots sprayed with dimethoate had the least number of holed and damaged fruit, followed by cypermethrin and neem seed extract in both the dry and wet seasons. There was no significance difference (P< 0. 05) between cypermthrin and neem seed extract. Therefore, further studies should be carried out to determine the efficacy of different concentrations of neem seed extract on the insect pest. Probably higher concentrations can effectively <b>protect</b> <b>tomato</b> fruit against the worm, and this {{can be part of}} the management strategy for the insect pest since neem products are environmentally friendly...|$|R
40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} and validated for the determination of residues of the organophosphorus nematicide fosthiazate in soil and water by using reversed-phase liquid chromatography with UV detection. Good recoveries (> 85 %) of fosthiazate residues were obtained from water samples (drinking water, groundwater, and liquid chromatography water) after passage of 0. 5 - 2 L water through solid-phase extraction (SPE) C- 18 cartridges and subsequent elution with ethyl acetate. Residues in soil were extracted with methanol-water (75 + 25, v/v) on a wrist-action shaker, and the extract was cleaned up on C- 18 SPE cartridges before analysis. The method was validated by analysis {{of a range of}} soils with different physicochemical characteristics; recoveries exceeded 87 % at fortification levels ranging from 0. 02 to 5. 0 mg/kg. The precision values obtained for the method, expressed as repeatability and reproducibility, were satisfactory (< 11 %). Fosthiazate detection limits were 0. 025 mu g/L and 0. 005 mg/kg for water and soil samples, respectively. The decline in the levels of fosthiazate residues in soil was measured after application of fosthiazate to <b>protected</b> <b>tomato</b> cultivation. The dissipation of fosthiazate residues followed first-order kinetics with a calculated half-life of 21 days...|$|R
