The {{following}} year, {{he was appointed}} to a commission charged with drafting a new city charter for Philadelphia, but the resulting document {{was rejected by the}} voters at <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>that</b> November. He was not a candidate for reelection in 1938, but in 1940 he ran again and was elected along with Finnerty and Samuel Rose. After that term ended, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Shepard recorder of deeds in Washington, D.C., a position he held until 1951. At that time, Shepard and Mary McLeod Bethune were the only two black people in government service in the nation's capital.|$|E

25|$|Republican {{presidential nominee}} John McCain had early hopes {{for winning the}} state. New Hampshire {{strongly}} supported McCain in the 2000 and 2008 Republican primaries, attracted by his status as an independent maverick; New Hampshire voters have historically been friendly to independent-minded Republicans. After he clinched the GOP nomination in March 2008, McCain began to move more {{to the right to}} appease the base of his party, and his selection of the socially conservative Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin to be the vice presidential nominee alienated several independents and libertarian-leaning Republicans in New Hampshire. Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama campaigned extensively throughout the state in 2008 to try and unite the party in the general election after the historic and divisive 2008 Democratic primary. Despite <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>that</b> had Obama leading by double digits, New Hampshire voters gave a surprise comeback win to Hillary Rodham Clinton in the January 2008 New Hampshire Democratic Primary {{thanks in large part to}} an enormous number of women who turned out to support Clinton after her emotional moment at a campaign stop in Portsmouth a few days earlier. Obama acknowledged this phenomenon throughout the campaign when he advised his supporters not to get so cocky and arrogant when they saw <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>that</b> had him leading.|$|E

2500|$|In 1994, {{moderate}} and conservative Democrats within the U.S. House of Representatives organized {{themselves into the}} Blue Dog Democrats, {{in response to the}} Republican victories at <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>that</b> November. The explanation was that the Blue Dogs felt the party had moved so far left that it had [...] "choked them blue." [...] The name is a reference to an earlier term, Yellow dog Democrat (typically, a southerner who would vote for a Democrat even if a [...] "yellow dog" [...] were the Democratic candidate) and also to the [...] "blue dog" [...] paintings of a Louisiana artist. The Blue Dog Coalition is not considered as conservative as the earlier Dixiecrat and Boll Weevil incarnations of conservative Democrats.|$|E
2500|$|Dean's {{approach}} organizationally {{was also}} novel. His campaign made {{extensive use of}} the Internet, pioneering techniques that were subsequently adopted by politicians of all political persuasions. His supporters organized real-world meetings, many of them arranged through Meetup.com, participated in online forums, donated money online, canvassed for advertising ideas, and distributed political talking points. In terms of money, publicity and activism, Dean therefore quickly staked out a leadership position {{in the field of}} candidates. In this way, he was able to bypass existing party and activist infrastructure and built his own online network of supporters. In terms of traditional [...] "ground troops", however, Dean remained at a disadvantage. Dean adopted a coffee shop strategy to visit grassroot activists in all 99 Iowa counties, but he lacked the campaign infrastructure to get voters to <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>that</b> his opponents had.|$|E
