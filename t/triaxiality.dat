50|$|Size and {{geometry}} {{also plays}} a role in determining the shape of the R curve. A crack in a thin sheet tends to produce a steeper R curve than a crack in a thick plate because there is a low degree of stress <b>triaxiality</b> at the crack tip in the thin sheet while the material near the tip of the crack in the thick plate may be in plane strain. The R curve can also change at free boundaries in the structure. Thus, a wide plate may exhibit a somewhat different crack growth resistance behavior than a narrow plate of the same material. Ideally, the R curve, as well as other measures of fracture toughness, is a property only of the material and does not depend on the size or shape of the cracked body. Much of fracture mechanics is predicated on the assumption that fracture toughness is a material property.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis work {{makes use}} of a {{recently}} developed ''second-order'' homogenization model to investigate failure in porous elasto-plastic solids under general triaxial loading conditions. The model incorporates dependence on the porosity and average pore shape, whose evolution is sensitive to the stress <b>triaxiality</b> and Lode parameter L. For positive <b>triaxiality</b> (with overall tensile hydrostatic stress), two different macroscopic failure mechanisms are possible, depending {{on the level of}} the <b>triaxiality.</b> At high <b>triaxiality,</b> void growth induces softening of the material, which overtakes the intrinsic strain hardening of the matrix phase, leading to a maximum in the effective stress-strain relation for the porous material, followed by loss of ellipticity by means of dilatant shear localization bands. In this regime, the ductility decreases with increasing <b>triaxiality</b> and is weakly dependent on the Lode parameter, in agreement with earlier theoretical analyses and experimental observations. At low <b>triaxiality,</b> however, a new mechanism comes into play consisting in the abrupt collapse of the voids along a compressive direction (with small, but finite porosity), which can dramatically soften the response of the porous material, leading to a sudden drop in its load-carrying capacity, and to loss of ellipticity of its incremental constitutive relation through localization of deformation. This low-triaxiality failure mechanism leads to a reduction in the ductility of the material as the <b>triaxiality</b> decreases to zero, and is highly dependent on the value of the Lode parameter. Thus, while no void collapse is observed at low <b>triaxiality</b> for axisymmetric tension (L=- 1), the ductility of the material drops sharply with decreasing values of the Lode parameter, and is smallest for biaxial tension with axisymmetric compression (L=+ 1). In addition, the model predicts a sharp transition from the low-triaxiality regime, with increasing ductility, to the high-triaxiality regime, with decreasing ductility, as the failure mechanism switches from void collapse to void growth, and is in qualitative agreement with recent experimental work...|$|E
