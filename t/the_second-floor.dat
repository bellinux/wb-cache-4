5|$|<b>The</b> <b>second-floor</b> {{served as}} the main {{sleeping}} quarters. It consists of a few simple bedrooms, all historically without closets. The upstairs hall contains a door which once accessed a staircase to the widow's walk, {{what remains of the}} space {{has been used as a}} closet for over a century.|$|E
5|$|The Glidden barn is of {{pole and}} beam construction. <b>The</b> <b>second-floor</b> {{interior}} {{is dominated by}} two large transverse wooden beams. It is of the three-bay, English tradition, the west bay containing a space for a stairwell leading to a hayloft and seven stalls. It is constructed of red brick and stands on a foundation of limestone. Glidden's barn took {{full advantage of the}} term vernacular; the brick was locally manufactured and the limestone locally quarried.|$|E
5|$|Lépine {{continued}} into <b>the</b> <b>second-floor</b> corridor and wounded three students before entering another {{room where he}} twice attempted to shoot a female student. His weapon failed to fire so he entered the emergency staircase where he was seen reloading his gun. He returned to the room he had just left, but the students had locked the door; Lépine failed to unlock it with three shots fired into the door. Moving along the corridor he shot at others, wounding one, before moving towards the financial services office where he shot and killed a woman {{through the window of}} the door she had just locked.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> new <b>second-floor</b> {{district}} courtroom {{overlooks the}} atrium lobby and contains dark cherry paneling and metal light fixtures. Other spaces include a bankruptcy courtroom, magistrate courtroom, jury assembly room, and offices. The project won Buildings magazine's new construction award in 2004.|$|R
5|$|The {{general layout}} of the home's {{interior}} has remained basically the same throughout the remodelings; the rooms on each floor are accessed via a large central hallway which ends in an elegant rotunda. However, {{some of the changes}} made in 1910 and 1911 did alter the interior appearance. The parlor was converted into the library and the library was converted into the dining room after an extension was added on. In the home's northwest corner a large kitchen was added, on <b>the</b> <b>second-floor,</b> the room above the kitchen became servant's quarters.|$|E
5|$|The coroner of Park County, Sharon Morris, {{confirmed}} that the body of Morrison (which had four bullet wounds, three non-fatal from police and one fatal shot from his own gun) was still in <b>the</b> <b>second-floor</b> classroom as of 6:00 p.m. An autopsy report later revealed that Morrison suffered two gunshot wounds to the head (including the fatal one fired from his gun), two additional in the right shoulder, and a graze wound to his right hand, while Emily Keyes died of a single gunshot wound {{to the right side}} of her head. District officials stated that both the high school and Fitzsimmons Middle School would be closed for September 28 and September 29; a counseling center set up at a local church would open at 7:00 a.m. for students.|$|E
5|$|The east bay of {{the barn}} {{contains}} an animal stall in its northeast corner and a fully enclosed office in its opposite corner. <b>The</b> <b>second-floor</b> hayloft {{is supported by the}} two massive transverse beams. The full-sized loft is accessible via an enclosed staircase against the south wall. The building's exterior roof is fully supported by the brick walls. The result is a loft which is an entirely open space save for some pole and beam construction supporting the laminated beams, which act as tie rods {{at the base of the}} roof. The barn roof is a common gable roof pitched at a 45degree angle, it was originally covered with wooden shingles, those have been replaced over the years with asphalt.|$|E
5|$|King was {{fatally shot}} by James Earl Ray at 6:01p.m., April 4, 1968, {{as he stood}} on <b>the</b> motel's <b>second-floor</b> balcony. <b>The</b> bullet entered through his right cheek, smashing his jaw, then {{traveled}} down his spinal cord before lodging in his shoulder.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Center's <b>second-floor</b> library houses {{more than}} 800 fiction, non-fiction and {{reference}} titles. A LGBT film archive, donated by screen-writer Ron Nyswaner and Hudson Valley resident Barbara Salzman, contains more than 1100 titles and is available for research, film festivals and screenings in the center.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> two-story, <b>second-floor</b> {{courtroom}} also retains some historic features. Details include original oak panel {{doors with}} classical surrounds, wainscot, baseboards, plaster walls with classically inspired panel molding, and ornamental plaster ceilings. Second-floor corridors have plaster walls with marble baseboards and oak chair rails. Square 1940 light fixtures remain.|$|R
5|$|Julia {{found out}} that she was {{pregnant}} in January 1940. John Winston Lennon was born on 9 October 1940, on <b>the</b> <b>second-floor</b> ward of the Oxford Street Maternity Hospital in Liverpool, supposedly during a German air raid in World War II, although it has been confirmed there was no air raid on this date. Alf first saw his son that November when he returned from working as a merchant seaman on troop transports during World War II. He sent regular pay cheques to Julia, who lived with her son at 9 Newcastle Road (the Stanley family's home). He occasionally went back to Liverpool, but did not stay long before he was sent off on another ship. The cheques to Julia stopped when he went absent without leave in 1943. Neither Julia nor the Merchant Navy knew of his whereabouts. Julia only found out because she stopped receiving her allowance money, and the Navy wrote to her to inform her that they were looking for him.|$|E
5|$|The Museum {{building}} {{consists of}} a three-level base building that is {{closed to the public}} and provides staff workspace and storage areas. Five public, two-story towers on the base are called the North, East, South, West and the Exhibitions Pavilions. The Exhibitions Pavilion acts as the temporary residence for traveling art collections and the Foundation's artwork for which the permanent pavilions have no room. The permanent collection is displayed throughout the other four pavilions chronologically: the north houses the oldest art while the west houses the newest. The first-floor galleries in each pavilion house light-sensitive art, such as illuminated manuscripts, furniture, or photography. Computer-controlled skylights on <b>the</b> <b>second-floor</b> galleries allow paintings to be displayed in natural light. The second floors are connected by a series of glass-enclosed bridges and open terraces, both of which offer views of the surrounding hillsides and central plaza. Sculpture is also on display at various points outside the buildings, including on various terraces and balconies. The lower level (the highest of the floors in the base) includes a public cafeteria, the terrace cafe, and the photography galleries.|$|E
5|$|The two SAS teams on-scene, Red Team and Blue Team, {{were ordered}} to begin their {{simultaneous}} assaults, under the codename Operation Nimrod, at 19:23. One group of four men from Red Team abseiled from the roof down {{the rear of the}} building, while another four-man team lowered a stun grenade through the skylight. The detonation of the stun grenade was supposed to coincide with the abseiling teams detonating explosives to gain entry to the building through <b>the</b> <b>second-floor</b> windows. Their descent had not gone according to plan and the staff sergeant leading the abseilers became entangled in his rope. While trying to assist him, one of the other soldiers had accidentally smashed a window with his foot. The noise of the breaking window alerted Oan, who was on the first floor communicating with the police negotiators, and he went to investigate. The soldiers were unable to use explosives for fear of injuring their stranded staff sergeant, but managed to smash their way into the embassy.|$|E
50|$|During the 19th century, {{a number}} of presidents used <b>the</b> White House's <b>second-floor</b> Yellow Oval Room as a private office or library.|$|R
50|$|Other {{attractive}} {{sections of}} the building are the impressive ballroom, the dining room, the dessert room, <b>the</b> huge, <b>second-floor</b> kitchen, <b>the</b> map room (with its unique cartographic collection) and the library (with its repository of remarkable, old books). Other noteworthy features include the Chippendale furniture, fine English porcelains and silverware.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} rowlock arches above {{all of the}} windows on the first floor. One of the west-facing windows {{on the second floor}} has two rowlock arches above it; <b>the</b> other <b>second-floor</b> windows are rectangular. There are two {{circular}} window openings in the attic, one facing west and the other south.|$|R
5|$|After {{the first}} three {{soldiers}} entered, a fire started and travelled up the curtains and out of <b>the</b> <b>second-floor</b> window, severely burning the staff sergeant. A second wave of abseilers cut him free, and he fell to the balcony below before entering the embassy behind {{the rest of his}} team. Slightly behind Red Team, Blue Team detonated explosives on a first-floor window, forcing Sim Harris, who had just run into the room, to take cover. Much of the operation {{at the front of the}} embassy took place in full view of the assembled journalists and was broadcast on live television, thus Harris's escape across the parapet of a first-floor balcony was famously captured on video. As the soldiers emerged onto the first-floor landing, Lock tackled Oan to prevent him attacking the SAS men. Oan, still armed, was subsequently shot dead by one of the soldiers. Meanwhile, further teams entered the embassy through the back door and cleared the ground floor and cellar. The SAS then began evacuating hostages, manhandling them down the stairs towards the back door of the embassy. Two of the terrorists were hiding amongst the hostages; one of them produced a hand grenade when he was identified. An SAS soldier, who was unable to shoot for fear of hitting a hostage or another soldier, pushed the grenade-wielding terrorist to the bottom of the stairs, where two other soldiers shot him dead.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} mural on <b>the</b> <b>second-floor</b> {{produced}} by the former Women's Luna Sea Theater Company.|$|E
25|$|The rear facade is {{identical}} to the front, except that the right first-floor opening is a plain board door rather than a window and that some of <b>the</b> <b>second-floor</b> doors still retain their original louvered and paneled shutter systems and have not had glass inserted.|$|E
5000|$|He is {{credited}} with re-designing the firefighter's [...] "turnout suit," [...] creating <b>the</b> first <b>second-floor</b> dormitory with <b>the</b> [...] "fireman's pole" [...] for fast access to the engine from the dormitory sleeping quarters, integrating the world's first electric/mechanical alarm system into the firehouse, as well as numerous other safety inventions.|$|R

50|$|Documentary {{research}} suggests that the house was built about 1877, but it has been placarded with the date 1748, the inscription crediting its early ownership to Gurdon Flagg. The doorway treatment is a clearly Georgian feature, and <b>the</b> missing <b>second-floor</b> window is also typical of that period. The decorative treatment of its eaves is suggestive of mid-19th century alterations.|$|R
25|$|Starting in 1623 <b>the</b> <b>second-floor</b> of {{the college}} was {{constructed}} (completed in 1627), the college also purchased theQuinta da Grimanesa in Fajã de Cima, where a house and cistern was constructed. Shortly later (13 September 1625), the historian Agostinho de Monte Alverne indicates that the church was also renovated.|$|E
25|$|Between 1919 and 1920, H.C. Pitney {{operated}} {{the building as}} the H.C. Pitney Variety Store, and <b>the</b> <b>second-floor</b> apartment was occupied by the family of 40th U.S. President Ronald Reagan. It is listed as a contributing property to the Tampico Main Street Historic District, which {{was added to the}} U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1982.|$|E
25|$|However, the 1951 {{renovation}} nearly entirely {{eliminated the}} historical {{integrity of the}} interior of the structure, with all interior trim and nearly all the walls removed. The house was converted into four apartments, with two stairways for accessing <b>the</b> <b>second-floor</b> apartments and the attic space. All four apartments are nearly identical, with two bedrooms, a small bathroom, a kitchen, and a combined living room/dining area.|$|E

From January-March 1953, the Courier published Hurston's series entitled, [...] "The Life Story of Ruby McCollum." ...|$|R
500|$|Other {{historic}} homes {{located along}} the South Branch Potomac River face the river; the mansion at Wappocomo {{is unique in}} that its formal façade faces toward Cumberland Road (West Virginia Route 28) and the western flanks of South Branch Mountain. This may be {{due in part to}} the house's distance from the river, approximately [...] <b>The</b> house's <b>second-floor</b> rear windows offer a scenic view of the South Branch Potomac River.|$|R
500|$|A notable {{feature of}} the house is <b>the</b> [...] <b>second-floor</b> Long Gallery, {{spanning}} the entire top floor of the house; it is the longest surviving long gallery in England. The gallery is lit by a continuous wall of glass on its eastern side while its length is extended by oriel windows at each end, which from the exterior appear to cling perilously to the wall, supported only by a small corbel [...] to the masonry.|$|R
25|$|Repairs {{were also}} {{undertaken}} in 1959, 1973, 1975 and 196; these include conservation; {{reconstruction of the}} access staircase to the tower; roofing the keep tower; and reconstruction of the gate. While in 1996, cleaning and consolidation of the exterior structures were carried out by employees of the municipal council {{and members of the}} Associação Adere-Lanhoso group, as well as the remodelling of <b>the</b> <b>second-floor</b> interiors.|$|E
25|$|The {{exterior}} and interior walls were cleaned in 1970, with cement reinforcement of the chemin de ronde, reinforcement of the joints and repairs to the main gate. Likewise, around 1975, the pavement and coverings in the keep were redone, including access stairs; repairs to <b>the</b> <b>second-floor</b> staircase {{and the construction of}} a protective covering; the second and third-floors were re-tiled; while the main floor and main gate were cleaned and repaired.|$|E
25|$|The side facades {{are similar}} to the front and rear, except for the absence of the arched passageway. Both sides are in five bays, all windows, on the first floor, with the {{exception}} of a door on the east side. <b>The</b> <b>second-floor</b> openings and balconies match the front with air conditioners generally mounted in the transoms. On the west side one second-floor door has a modern boxed-out bar grille around it.|$|E
50|$|The Detroit Yacht Club clubhouse was {{designed}} by architect George D. Mason in a Mediterranean Revival style. The building sits on a man-made island constructed from fill dirt excavated from other construction projects. The cornerstone of the building was laid in 1922 by Gar Wood and the building was completed in 1923. The clubhouse is a rambling, informal structure. Of particular note are the two grand staircases and <b>the</b> wood-panelled <b>second-floor</b> ballroom.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, a $12 million {{restoration}} {{project of}} the library was undertaken. A new staircase {{was added to the}} building, which used marble slabs from the library's original stacks. Additionally, the original granite porch of <b>the</b> library's <b>second-floor</b> entrance was removed, relocating the main entrance to grade. The interior restoration required the creation of corridors {{in order to make the}} building multi-use, as the original interior had been a single open space.|$|R
60|$|Guster is minding the shop, for the 'prentices take tea in {{the kitchen}} with Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby; consequently, the robe-maker's two daughters, combing their curls at the two glasses in <b>the</b> two <b>second-floor</b> windows of <b>the</b> {{opposite}} house, are not driving the two 'prentices to distraction as they fondly suppose, but are merely awakening the unprofitable admiration of Guster, whose hair won't grow, and never would, and it is confidently thought, never will.|$|R
