In <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>to</b> {{the south of the}} chancel is a Decorated piscina which has been moved from elsewhere. A memorial plate in the north chancel aisle is dated 1666. The two-manual organ is a 1910 Norman and Beard organ moved from a redundant church in the North of England which was rebuilt and installed in 1976. There is a ring of six bells which were all cast in the 18thcentury by Rudhall of Gloucester.|$|E

After the visit Speaker Bolger met with the Michigan State Police to discuss alternatives to fighting crime, as well as discussing plans about alternative sentencing options with other legislators.|$|E
25|$|Bryant {{moved back}} to the buses where Janet Quin lay injured from the earlier shot. Bryant shot her in the back, then left; she later died from her wounds. Bryant then went onto one of the coaches and fired a shot at Elva Gaylard who was hiding inside, hitting her in the arm and chest and killing her. At an {{adjacent}} coach, Gordon Francis saw what happened and moved down <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>to</b> try to shut the door of the coach he was on. He was seen by Bryant and shot from the opposite coach. He survived, but needed four major operations.|$|E
25|$|The sieges {{ended when}} the Constitutional Court banned the People's Power Party {{and two of}} its {{coalition}} allies. During the critical period that followed the rulings, it is alleged that Army commander and co-leader of the 2006 coup, General Anupong Paochinda, coerced former PPP MPs, mainly those of the Friends of Newin Group, to endorse a Democrat Party-led coalition, which secured enough parliamentary votes to allow Abhisit to be elected Prime Minister. These MPs, along with MPs of 4 other former PPP-coalition parties, crossed <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>to</b> endorse a Democrat-led coalition government. In a December 2008 parliamentary session, the Democrat-led coalition government was voted upon, with 235 to 198 votes in favor of Democrat Party leader and candidate for PM Abhisit Vejjajiva.|$|E

25|$|Gomez, in his 2000 autobiography, {{wrote about}} Duke:He once {{presented}} a {{bill on the}} floor, {{one of the few}} which he had managed to get out of committee. He finished his opening presentation and strolled with great self-satisfaction back up <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>to</b> his seat. In his mind, he had spoken, made his presentation and that was that. Before he had even reached his desk and re-focused on the proceedings, another first-term member had been recognized for the floor and immediately moved to table the bill. The House voted for the motions effectively killing the bill. That and similar procedures were used against him many times. Gomez said that he recalls Duke obtaining the passage of only a single bill, legislation which prohibited movie producers or book publishers from compensating jurors for accounts of their court experiences.|$|E

[...] The tourist lady states that kids should [...] "be free, no guilt" [...] and should [...] "do whatever you want, just {{so long as you}} don't hurt anyone." [...] She observes that long hair is natural, like the [...] "elegant plumage" [...] of male birds ("My Conviction"). [...] She opens her coat to reveal that she's a man in drag.

500|$|For the I Am... disc, Beyoncé was {{influenced}} by folk and alternative rock genres, while incorporating other instruments she had not normally used previously, such as the acoustic guitar. Tedder specifically assisted Beyoncé with crafting the album's balladry. The ballads were crafted {{in a way to}} combine [...] "the best elements" [...] of pop and soul music, while simultaneously [...] "expanding the possibilities of both genres". Beyoncé attempted something different as people had strong expectations from her; she experimented with stronger lyrics. Beyoncé worked with Ghost to re-write Franz Schubert's [...] "Ave Maria" [...] after having co-written [...] "Disappear" [...] in London, England. Ghost told The Daily Telegraph that they were both inspired by their then-recent marriages and had walked down <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>to</b> [...] "Ave Maria".|$|E

500|$|Mikkel Storleer Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen, {{together}} under the stage name Stargate, wrote and produced the song with additional writing by Amanda Ghost, Ian Dench and Makeba Riddick. The song was written in Bangladesh, Patchwerk and Silent Sound Studios in Atlanta, Georgia in 2008. Knowles worked with Amanda Ghost to re-write Franz Schubert's [...] "Ave Maria" [...] after having co-written [...] "Disappear" [...] in London. She stated that the song {{was one of the}} most personal on the album. Ghost told The Daily Telegraph that Knowles' references to rapper Jay-Z are usually unclear and open to interpretation, yet her music, including [...] "Ave Maria", [...] "is the one place she can be incredibly expressive". Knowles and Ghost both liked Schubert's song and walked down <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>to</b> the song during their respective weddings.

500|$|Elizabeth Day, {{writing for}} The Guardian, commented [...] "For many, the quintessential {{on-screen}} wedding remains the 1987 marriage of Scott and Charlene in Australian daytime soap Neighbours. It was the apotheosis {{of a romantic}} teenage love story which brought together two feuding families– the Robinsons and the Ramsays– {{in much the same}} way as the Montagues and the Capulets, albeit with fewer deaths and more shoulder pads." [...] The Birmingham Post's Gemma Quade named the wedding one of her five most memorable Neighbours storylines, calling it a [...] "tearjerker episode". Josephine Monroe, author of The Neighbours Programme Guide, wrote that the episode showed the [...] "soap wedding of the century!", adding [...] "Teenagers Scott and Charlene tied the knot in a traditional and emotional church service". During a feature on how to celebrate a wedding ceremony in the style of a soap opera, Tom Cole from the Radio Times said [...] "Who needs Mendelssohn and Bach when you can process down <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>to</b> power ballad 'Suddenly' by Australian rocker Angry Anderson? Sounds unorthodox, but it put pep in the step of Scott and Charlene in Neighbours. Note to groom: we can't all swan around like we're Jason Donovan, so give the feathered mullet a miss." ...|$|E
50|$|The arcade on {{the north}} side of the nave was built about 1350, when <b>the</b> north <b>aisle</b> was added. There is also an unusually large hagioscope or squint giving a view from <b>the</b> north <b>aisle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chancel and altar.|$|R

In June 2010, it was revealed that the 6000th episode celebrations would see the wedding of Donna and Ringo.

Robbie said she had [...] "big shoes to fill", but she was honoured to be working on her biggest storyline since she arrived. Clark said that Donna and Ringo had made the decision {{that they are going to}} be with each other for life and that they are [...] "going to be solid from now on".

Clark added [...] "It's a perfect day, but I can't promise they'll live happily ever after." [...] Donna and Ringo became the 36th couple to get married on the show. A month later, Ringo is knocked down by Stephanie Scully's (Carla Bonner) motorcycle and he dies. Donna is devastated and she stays in her room. Steph comes to visit her and as she is apologising, Donna gets up and hugs her. Of Donna's reaction, Robbie said [...] "Donna is almost in a state of confusion and insists that the whole thing was an accident. Donna is just numb and she doesn't know what to feel." ...|$|E

25|$|Like Alberti, della Porta and others, in the {{designing}} of {{a church}} façade, Palladio was confronted by the problem of visually linking <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nave while maintaining and defining {{the structure of the}} building. Palladio’s solution was entirely different from that employed by della Porta. At the church of San Giorgio Maggiore in Venice he overlays a tall temple, its columns raised on high plinths, over another low wide temple façade, its columns rising from the basements and its narrow lintel and pilasters appearing behind the giant order of the central nave.|$|R

He shut down <b>the</b> southern <b>aisle,</b> <b>to</b> allow <b>the</b> sun to penetrate into the rooms, and gave a symmetrical appearance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other <b>aisle.</b> <b>To</b> achieve this he was obliged to paint false windows in the medieval part of the Castle, the walls being 2 meters thick.
