5|$|Psychology is {{the science}} that investigates mental states directly. It uses {{generally}} empirical methods to investigate concrete mental states like joy, fear or obsessions. Psychology investigates <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>that</b> bind these mental states {{to each other}} or with inputs and outputs to the human organism.|$|E
5|$|During 1895, Robert S. Hatcher, {{the reading}} clerk of the Indiana Senate, was {{directed}} to ascertain {{the legal status of}} the design of the state seal. After a thorough review, Hatcher found that <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>that</b> authorized the seal did not explicitly state what its design should be. He recommended that a bill be passed to standardize the seal. Senator McCord submitted legislation for that purpose, but no action was taken on it.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{the state}} {{legislature}} began to reform <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>that</b> governed the production of alcoholic beverages. With {{the passing of the}} New Jersey Farm Winery Act in 1981, and laws providing for licenses for brewpubs and microbreweries in the 1990s, these two industries have grown significantly and the number of wineries and breweries have steadily increased. In February 2013, New Jersey issued the first new distillery license since before Prohibition, and legislation has been proposed {{to make it easier to}} establish craft distilleries in New Jersey. , New Jersey currently has 48 wineries, 28 breweries, and 2 distilleries.|$|E

60|$|All laws of {{causation}} are {{liable to}} be counteracted or frustrated, by the non-fulfillment of some negative condition; the tendency, therefore, of B to produce C may be defeated. Now <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> A produces B, is equally fulfilled whether B is followed by C or not; but <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> A produces C by means of B, is of course only fulfilled when B is really followed by C, and is, therefore, less general than <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> A produces B. It is also less general than <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> B produces C. For B may have other causes besides A; and as A produces C only by means of B, while B produces C, whether it has itself been produced by A or by any thing else, <b>the</b> second <b>law</b> embraces {{a greater number of}} instances, covers as it were a greater space of ground, than the first.|$|R

Section 5 of Article IX prohibits such foreign corporations from doing anything in Virginia that a Virginia corporation could not do.|$|E
5|$|Caesar became consul in 59 BC. His colleague, Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, was {{an extreme}} aristocrat. Caesar {{submitted}} <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>that</b> {{he had promised}} Pompey to the assemblies. Bibulus attempted to obstruct the enactment of these laws, and so Caesar used violent means to ensure their passage. Caesar was then made governor of three provinces. He facilitated {{the election of the}} former patrician Publius Clodius Pulcher to the tribunate for 58 BC. Clodius set about depriving Caesar's senatorial enemies of two of their more obstinate leaders in Cato and Cicero. Clodius was a bitter opponent of Cicero because Cicero had testified against him in a sacrilege case. Clodius attempted to try Cicero for executing citizens without a trial during the Catiline conspiracy, resulting in Cicero going into self-imposed exile and his house in Rome being burnt down. Clodius also passed a bill that forced Cato to lead the invasion of Cyprus which would keep him away from Rome for some years. Clodius also passed a law to expand the previous partial grain subsidy to a fully free grain dole for citizens.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, the Scottish {{publisher}} Robert Chambers anonymously {{published an}} extremely controversial but widely read book entitled Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. This book proposed an evolutionary scenario for {{the origins of}} the Solar System and of life on Earth. It claimed that the fossil record showed a progressive ascent of animals, with current animals branching off a main line that leads progressively to humanity. It implied that the transmutations lead to the unfolding of a preordained plan that had been woven into <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>that</b> governed the universe. In this sense it was less completely materialistic than the ideas of radicals like Grant, but its implication that humans were only the last step in the ascent of animal life incensed many conservative thinkers. The high profile of the public debate over Vestiges, with its depiction of evolution as a progressive process, would greatly influence the perception of Darwin's theory a decade later.|$|E

5|$|Roman {{government}} was headed by two consuls, elected annually by the citizens and advised by a senate composed of appointed magistrates. As Roman society was very hierarchical by modern standards, {{the evolution of}} the Roman {{government was}} heavily influenced by the struggle between the patricians, Rome's land-holding aristocracy, who traced their ancestry to the founding of Rome, and the plebeians, the far more numerous citizen-commoners. Over time, <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>that</b> gave patricians exclusive rights to Rome's highest offices were repealed or weakened, and leading plebeian families became full members of the aristocracy. The leaders of the Republic developed a strong tradition and morality requiring public service and patronage in peace and war, making military and political success inextricably linked. Many of Rome's legal and legislative structures (later codified into the Justinian Code, and again into the Napoleonic Code) can still be observed throughout Europe and much of the world in modern nation states and international organizations.|$|E

60|$|Thus, in {{our former}} example, <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> contact {{of an object}} causes {{a change in the}} state of the nerve, is more general than <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> contact with an object causes {{sensation}}, since, for aught we know, the change in the nerve may equally take place when, from a counteracting cause, as, for instance, strong mental excitement, the sensation does not follow; as in a battle, where wounds are sometimes received without any consciousness of receiving them. And again, <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> change in <b>the</b> state of a nerve produces sensation, is more general than <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> contact with an object produces sensation; since the sensation equally follows the change in the nerve when not produced by contact with an object, but by some other cause; as in the well-known case, when a person who has lost a limb feels the same sensation which he has been accustomed to call a pain in the limb.|$|R

This led to increased calls for the same ban in America, supported by members of the U.S. Congress from both the North and the South as well as President Thomas Jefferson.|$|E
