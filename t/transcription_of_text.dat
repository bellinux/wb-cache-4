5000|$|The {{first of}} E. V. Lucas's editions {{appeared}} as volumes 6 and 7 of his Works of Charles and Mary Lamb (1903-1905), {{and for the}} first time included Mary's correspondence on equal terms. It contained only 590 letters, but he highlighted one of the problems which had caused his and several previous editions to leave out easily findable material:Owing to the curious operations of the law of copyright, it will not for at least forty-two years be possible for any one edition of Lamb's correspondence to contain all the letters. To-day, in order to possess a set complete down to the present time, one must purchase at least nine, and possibly more, works, amounting to many volumes―among them Charles Lamb and the Lloyds, of which I was the editor, but which I am debarred from using.His second edition was published in 1912 with 604 letters. His third edition, The Letters of Charles Lamb, to which is Added Those of His Sister Mary Lamb (1935), included as many as 1,027 letters, Lucas's publishers having negotiated a solution to the copyright problems, so that he was able to claim that [...] "The present edition of the letters of Charles Lamb is the first to bring all the known material into one work." [...] Even Lucas's harshest critics acknowledge that the 1935 edition's completeness made it the best available up to that point, but several papers in academic journals by George L. Barnett and other Lamb scholars have made it clear that the texts are unreliable. Barnett complained that Lucas appeared not to have read manuscript letters of whose location he was well aware, that on the contrary many, if not most, of the letters are based on previous and faulty editions, and that Lucas has failed to avoid the tendency of editors of Lamb's letters to perpetuate errors and to inaugurate others by overzealous emendation, excessive editing, and downright carelessness. He elsewhere referred to [...] "faulty dating, erroneous location of manuscripts, incorrect <b>transcription</b> <b>of</b> <b>text,</b> and misinformation in the notes".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a framework for}} semi-automatic transcription of large-scale historical handwritten documents and proposes a simple user-friendly text extractor tool, TexT for transcription. The proposed approach provides a quick and easy <b>transcription</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> using computer assisted interactive technique. The algorithm finds multiple occurrences of the marked text on-the-fly using a word spotting system. TexT is also capable of performing on-the-fly annotation of handwritten text with automatic generation of ground truth labels, and dynamic adjustment and correction of user generated bounding box annotations with the word being perfectly encapsulated. The user can view the document and the found words in the original form or with background noise removed for easier visualization of transcription results. The effectiveness of TexT is demonstrated on an archival manuscript collection from well-known publicly available dataset...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} for performing phonetic <b>transcription</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> that utilizes automatic speech recognition (ASR) to help traditional grapheme-to-phoneme (G 2 P) techniques. This approach was applied to transcribe Chinese text into Taiwanese phonetic symbols. By augmenting the text with speech and using automatic speech recognition with a sausage searching net constructed from multiple pronunciations of text, {{we are able to}} reduce the error rate of phonetic transcription. Using a pronunciation lexicon with multiple pronunciations for each item, a transcription error rate of 12. 74 % was achieved. Further improvement can be achieved by adapting the pronunciation lexicon with pronunciation variation (PV) rules derived manually from corrected transcription in a speech corpus. The PV rules can be categorized into two kinds: knowledge-based and data-driven rules. By incorporating the PV rules, an error rate of 10. 56 % could be achieved. Although this technique was developed for Taiwanese speech, it could easily be adapted to other Chinese spoken languages or dialects...|$|E

40|$|Handwritten text is {{generally}} captured through two main modalities: off-line and on-line. Each modality has advantages and disadvantages, {{but it seems}} clear that smart approaches to handwritten text recognition (HTR) should make use of both modalities in order {{to take advantage of the}} positive aspects of each one. A particularly interesting case where the need of this bi-modal processing arises is when an off-line text, written by some writer, is considered along with the on-line modality of the same text written by another writer. This happens, for example, in computer-assisted <b>transcription</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> images, where on-line text can be used to interactively correct errors made by a main off-line HTR system. In order to develop adequate techniques to deal with this challenging bi-modal HTR recognition task, a suitable corpus is needed. We have collected such a corpus using data (word segments) from the publicly available off-line and on-line IAM data sets. In order to establish baseline performance figures, we have also obtained uni-modal results for each modality, as well as bi-modal results using Handwritten text is one of the most natural communication channels currently availabl...|$|E
40|$|The {{digitization}} {{of historical}} handwritten document images {{is important for}} the preservation of cultural heritage. Moreover, the <b>transcription</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> images obtained from digitization is necessary to provide efficient information access to the content of these documents. Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) has become an important research topic in the areas of image and computational language processing that allows us to obtain transcriptions from text images. State-of-the-art HTR systems are, however, far from perfect. One difficulty is that they have to cope with image noise and handwriting variability. Another difficulty is the presence of a large amount of Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) words in ancient historical texts. A solution to this problem is to use external lexical resources, but such resources might be scarce or unavailable given the nature and the age of such documents. This work proposes a solution to avoid this limitation. It consists of associating a powerful optical recognition system that will cope with image noise and variability, with a language model based on sub-lexical units that will model OOV words. Such a language modeling approach reduces the size of the lexicon while increasing the lexicon coverage. Experiments are first conducted on the publicly available Rodrigo dataset, which contains the digitization of an ancient Spanish manuscript, with a recognizer based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). They show that sub-lexical units outperform word units in terms of Word Error Rate (WER), Character Error Rate (CER) and OOV word accuracy rate. This approach is then applied to deep net classifiers, namely Bi-directional Long-Short Term Memory (BLSTMs) and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Nets (CRNNs). Results show that CRNNs outperform HMMs and BLSTMs, reaching the lowest WER and CER for this image dataset and significantly improving OOV recognition...|$|E
