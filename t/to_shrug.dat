The Reagan tax cuts seemed to work and Americans were able <b>to</b> <b>shrug</b> off the crash of 1987 by the beginning of 1988. The growth ended by 1990 after seven years of stock market growth and prosperity for the upper and middle class. The federal debt spawned by his policies tripled (from $930billion in 1981 to $2.6trillion in 1988), reaching record levels.|$|E

500|$|In {{a review}} for the album The Immaculate Collection, David Browne of Entertainment Weekly {{compared}} the song with the moves of Carmen Miranda on MTV. Slant Magazine music critic Sal Cinquemani, {{in a review}} for the True Blue album, called the song one of Madonna's greatest, most influential and timeless songs. Author Maury Dean in his book Rock 'n' Roll Gold Rush praised the song saying, [...] "Madonna coos a Spanish lullaby. Sizzly romance blooms among the cozy sheltering palms.

500|$|Much of {{the lyrics}} were {{composed}} by Batmanglij and Koenig in Batmanglij's apartment (a former factory building in Brooklyn) and at a rented cottage on Martha's Vineyard. The lyrics explore more mature, world-weary themes such as growing old and disillusionment with American foreign policy. The album eschewed the theme of privileged youth from their first two albums in favor of characters with adult responsibilities and reflections on the passage of time. Faith and mortality are recurring themes on songs such as [...] "Unbelievers", [...] "Worship You", and [...] "Everlasting Arms". Koenig likened their first three albums to Brideshead Revisited: [...] "The naïve joyous school days in the beginning. Then {{the expansion of the}} world, travel, seeing other places, learning {{a little bit more about}} how people live. And then the end is a little bit of growing up, starting to think more seriously about your life and your faith. If people could look at our three albums as a bildungsroman, I’d be O.K. with that." [...] According to Brice Ezell from PopMatters, Modern Vampires of the City is [...] "very much an indie rock record" [...] because of Koenig's voice and diction, which reveals [...] "the youth that he and his bandmates so often strive <b>to</b> <b>shrug</b> off." [...] Ezell asserts that, on songs such as [...] "Unbelievers", the [...] "reckless abandon" [...] expressed by the lyrics reveals [...] "the group's grasp on the genuine rebellion that indie rock ought to strive for." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 1938–39 offseason, Pearson {{became a}} {{contract}} holdout after {{he rejected the}} Yankees' initial offer. [...] Reportedly the same amount he had earned the season before ($10,000), he described the contract offer as [...] "not up to [...] expectations." [...] The two sides eventually agreed to a contract worth $13,500. [...] He kept up his good pitching, garnering the seventh-highest winning percentage (.706) in the AL that year, though his ERA ballooned to 4.49. [...] Throughout the season, problems in his pitching arm flared up again, restricting him to just [...] innings pitched and 20 games started. [...] As a result, his inclusion on the postseason roster was not guaranteed; in late September, McCarthy appeared resigned {{to the fact that}} Pearson would not [...] "be able to help [...] in this series." [...] However, he managed <b>to</b> <b>shrug</b> off his injury woes and was penciled into the starting rotation for Game 2 of the 1939 World Series. [...] Facing the Cincinnati Reds, he held them hitless through [...] innings pitched—eventually giving up just two singles—while striking out eight and walking one in a complete game, 4–0 victory. [...] Pearson's sublime pitching performance {{is considered one of the}} greatest in World Series history; with a game score of 90, it is one of only eight Fall Classic starts to record a game score of 90 or above. [...] The Yankees proceeded to sweep the Reds two games later, resulting in their fourth consecutive championship and giving Pearson the distinction of winning a World Series ring in every season of his Yankees tenure.|$|E

500|$|One of Darren's {{earliest}} storylines saw him {{and friend}} Luke Morgan (Gary Lucy) stand up to bully Mark Gibbs (Colin Parry). Darren becomes friends with Mark {{in an attempt to}} deter Mark's bullying but Mark soon after rapes Luke. Darren takes advantage of the situation and begins a relationship with Luke's girlfriend Mandy Richardson (Sarah Jayne Dunn). Dawson commented on this saying, [...] "Darren liked Mandy even before he went to America so he was gutted when he came back to discover she had started going out with Luke. And all along, Luke knew that Darren wanted to get together with Mandy ... Luke has other things on his mind and seems to be ignoring Mandy, so Darren thinks it is the perfect opportunity to make his move". Before Darren asks Mandy out he confronts Luke who [...] "gives him the green light". Dawson opined that although viewers may think Mandy and Darren are being [...] "heartless" [...] they don't know about Luke's attack so are not to blame. Dawson felt that initially the relationship is a [...] "flirty kind of friendship" [...] although Mandy realises she likes Darren and plans to use Darren as a means of reuniting with Luke. As Darren and Mandy spend more time together their relationship [...] "develops". If Darren were to find out about Luke's rape, Dawson felt Darren would help Luke get [...] "revenge" [...] on Mark. He said Mandy would either be [...] "shocked and turn to Darren for support" [...] or [...] "feel guilty about what she's done" [...] and reunite with Luke. Dawson felt if this were to happen Darren would [...] "try <b>to</b> <b>shrug</b> it off" [...] although [...] "deep down, he cares for Mandy". Dawson felt that Darren should become a [...] "hero" [...] to Luke, fixing all his problems which would rectify him beginning a relationship with Mandy.|$|E

It was Martin himself who brought the first prosecution under the Act, when he had Bill Burns, a costermonger—a street seller of fruit—arrested for beating a donkey, and paraded the animal's injuries before a reportedly astonished court. Burns was fined, and newspapers and music halls were full of jokes about how Martin had relied on the testimony of a donkey.|$|E

2500|$|Berthe de Villers' {{remarkable}} {{victory at}} Gia Cuc, coupled with Rivière's simultaneous Capture of Nam Dinh, demoralised the Vietnamese, appreciably raised French prestige in Tonkin, and emboldened French policymakers <b>to</b> <b>shrug</b> off the growing prospects of direct Chinese intervention in Tonkin. [...] Meanwhile, {{the failure of}} cooperation between Prince Hoang and Liu Yongfu alarmed the Chinese. [...] The senior Chinese civil mandarin Tang Jingsong (Tang Ching-sung) reconciled {{the two men in}} April 1883, and persuaded Liu Yongfu to take the field against the French with the Black Flag Army. [...] The result, in May 1883, was the disastrous French defeat at the Battle of Paper Bridge, in which both Rivière and Berthe de Villers were killed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{controversial}} {{penalty was}} a big break for ASU as it resulted in a large momentum shift in allowing the Sun Devils to score. [...] Video replays did show several Longhorns were on the field along with Jessee, despite an earlier bench warning {{that was given to}} Texas. [...] For his role in inadvertently penalizing his team, Jessee has been compared to Steve Bartman, the man who may have inadvertently hurt the World Series prospects of the Chicago Cubs by interfering with a ball still in play. [...] Unlike Bartman, Jessee’s goof did not result in a loss for his team; the Longhorns were able <b>to</b> <b>shrug</b> off the setback.

2500|$|Luke and Noah meet at WOAK, a local {{television}} station in Oakdale, {{where they are}} working as interns, but their relationship is complex from the beginning. Luke's first crush for Kevin Davis ended badly when he [...] "came out" [...] to Kevin and was fiercely rejected, and Noah is involved with co-worker Maddie Coleman. In fact, Noah thinks jealously that Luke is pursuing his girlfriend until Luke reveals first his sexual orientation and then his attraction to Noah. After this, Noah struggles with his own feelings for Luke. One day, when Luke is helping Noah with his tie, Noah impulsively kisses him; he tries <b>to</b> <b>shrug</b> this off as a joke before finally admitting to himself and Luke that he meant it. He isn't, however, {{ready to deal with}} being gay. Although Luke urges him to be honest with Maddie and to acknowledge his own sexuality, Noah hesitates.|$|E

2500|$|Damage in M {{is handled}} {{differently}} as well. M {{does not use}} Hit Points. Instead, characters have a fourth Saving Throw called the Toughness Save ("Damage Save" [...] in the previous edition) {{which is based on}} their Constitution scores (just like Fortitude). Weapons and powers that do lethal and subdual damage do not roll any dice to determine damage. Instead, damaging attacks are ranked based upon their overall power. For example, a fairly fit but normal human may throw a punch that inflicts +1N (non-lethal) damage, while the irradiated simian mastermind with enhanced strength and razor-sharp claws throws out +12L (lethal) damage. When a character is struck by an attack, he or she rolls a Toughness Save against a target number equal to the rank of the attack plus 15. Success allows the character <b>to</b> <b>shrug</b> off the attack with minimal effect, while failure results in injury according to the degree of failure and the type of damage. Accumulated damage applies a penalty to further saves, increasing the chances of any given attack taking the character down.|$|E

[...] The day before his arrival, all beggars, homeless children and starving people were removed from the streets. [...] Shop windows in local stores were filled with food, but purchases were forbidden, and anyone coming too close to the stores was arrested. [...] The streets were washed. [...] Just like all other Western visitors, Herriot met fake [...] "peasants", all selected Communists or Komsomol members, who showed him healthy cattle.
