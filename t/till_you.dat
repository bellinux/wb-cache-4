500|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Annie held a monthly DJ night called Pop <b>Till</b> <b>You</b> Drop with friend Frøken Blytt in her {{hometown}} of Bergen, Norway. There she met producer Tore Kroknes, and the two began dating. Annie and Kroknes borrowed a small studio from downtempo duo Röyksopp to record her debut single [...] "The Greatest Hit". The song, which uses a sample of Madonna's 1982 dance-pop single [...] "Everybody", had a limited edition release in 1999. It became an underground hit at clubs in Norway and Britain, resulting in offers for record deals. The two recorded Annie's second single, titled [...] "I Will Get On". She focused on vocals and melodies in music, and Kroknes concentrated on production, influenced by techno, disco and house music. As she began to work on her debut album, Kroknes became ill due to a heart defect. He died eighteen months later, in April 2001. Because of their plan to make the album together, Annie struggled with the idea of collaborating with anyone else and stopped work on it entirely.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the mass}} {{success of the}} band's self-titled album, author Dick Porter wrote that the {{anticipation}} for a follow up was intense. Prior to its release, drummer Jordison proclaimed: [...] "Wait <b>till</b> <b>you</b> hear our fuckin' next record. It smokes our first album. The shit's twice as technical, three times as heavy." [...] Iowa generally received favorable reviews from music critics. The College Music Journal reviewed it as [...] "brutal, unrelenting, scorching..." [...] Many reviews noted its heavy themes; Alternative Press stated, [...] " [...] like having a plastic bag taped over your head for an hour while Satan uses your scrotum as a speedbag.... is over the top...you're {{going to be left}} in stitches." [...] NME said that it is [...] "Exhilarating, brutal and good." [...] Rolling Stone credited the album for its originality, stating that [...] "nearly everything else in modern doom rock sounds banal." [...] Producer Robinson was also praised for his work on the album; Uncut noted, [...] "The barely relenting, tumbling noise attack marshalled by nu metal uber-producer Ross Robinson is expert." [...] Reviewing for Yahoo, John Mulvey said, [...] "They're an evolutionary dead end, the final, absolute triumph of nu metal." ...|$|E

There {{are more than a}} couple of moments in the game in which your party is ambushed by enemy spellcasters that rip you to pieces before you can even think about a proper response." [...] He praised the game's music as blending in seamlessly with that of the original game, but criticized it for having a minimal amount of voice acting, with sequences of dialogue that begin with audio and transition into text. Steve Butts commented on this, saying, [...] "the dialogue here really needs some work ... you'll even be treated to some truly tortured sentences. 'Wait <b>till</b> <b>you</b> see how deep into the backside of evil I insert my boot in the name of justice!' is probably my favorite. It's too bad there's not more voice acting in the game, because hearing someone speak lines like that out loud may have given the developers an opportunity to edit some of the worst offenders." ...|$|E
