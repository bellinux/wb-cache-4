40|$|The {{aim of this}} researching is {{to expose}} {{that if there is}} any {{important}} difference between the knowledges about the methods and <b>technics</b> <b>of</b> teaching belong to the teachers attended to the in service education and are responsable of teaching knowledge of science lesson before and after the activity of applied seminar. It has been asked 10 open ended questions to the 43 teachers who are on duty in the city center of Tekirdağ, about their methods and technics before the seminar (preliminary test), and then it has been asked the same questions {{at the end of the}} seminar (final test) and finally it has been researched that if the knowledges of teachers changed according to their seniorities. The data which has been obtained from the researching was evaluated with the analysis of content. At the end of the evaluation of the data; it has been identified that the teachers had used mostly the <b>technics</b> <b>of</b> question-answer, straight expression and experiment. As a result, it can be declared that the teachers who have the greater seniority professionaly have less perception according to juniors relating to the methods and <b>technics</b> <b>of</b> teaching. Furthermore, it has been observed that the knowledges of the teachers relating to the methods and <b>technics</b> <b>of</b> education has been increased considerably...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine Nietzsche's {{relation}} to the life sciences of his time and to Darwinism in particular, arguing that {{his account of the}} will to power in terms <b>of</b> <b>technics</b> eschews three metaphysical prejudices, hylemorphism, utilitarianism, and teleological thinking. Telescoping some of Nietzsche's pronouncements on the will to power with a Bergsonian lens, our reading of the will to power, as an operation productive of time, the future or life, offers an alternative to Heidegger's. Rather than being reducible to a <b>technics</b> <b>of</b> domination or mastery, the will to power, we argue, is best interpreted as a <b>technics</b> <b>of</b> material forces that recasts all things past and future, near and far, moment by moment. ...|$|R

40|$|The caryologic {{technics}} aim {{to determine}} the level of polyploidy of a population or a species. The information brought for {{the knowledge of the}} chromosomal number of a species, is of various nature. Thus for several years the caryology has made it possible to better understand the taxonomy of a species, its tendencies evolutionary, its geographical distribution and the phenomena of its speciation [16]. Any time the chromosomal number, although being able to characterize a plant or a group of plants is not a character constant. It can vary inside a group, tribe, family or kind, and within same species[12, 15, 16]. The <b>technics</b> <b>of</b> identification of the most known chromosomes are: traditional technics based on the histological cut, the <b>Technics</b> <b>of</b> Feulgen which has like action to colour in purple red the DNA chromosomal [6, 7, 8] and <b>technics</b> <b>of</b> bands or mechanisms that it brings into play are related to the physicochemical properties of the chromatin and the condensed form of the chromosomes. To highlight the chromosomes of a species we observed somatic mitosis carried out bolsters of young roots.
