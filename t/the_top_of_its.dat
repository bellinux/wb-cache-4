5|$|P. labiata usually lays eggs on dead, brown leaves about 20millimetres long, {{suspended}} near <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> capture web, {{and then}} cover the eggs {{with a sheet}} of silk. If there is no dead leaf available, the female will make a small horizontal silk platform in the capture web, lay the eggs on it, and then cover the eggs.|$|E
5|$|The Galloway is {{naturally}} hornless, {{and instead of}} horns has a bone knob at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> skull called the poll.

5|$|Like other abelisaurids, Majungasaurus was a bipedal {{predator}} {{with a short}} snout. Although the forelimbs are {{not completely}} known, they were very short, while the hind limbs were longer and very stocky. It can be distinguished from other abelisaurids by its wider skull, the very rough texture and thickened bone on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> snout, and the single rounded horn {{on the roof of}} its skull, which was originally mistaken for the dome of a pachycephalosaur. It also had more teeth in both upper and lower jaws than most abelisaurids.|$|E

50|$|According to Aboriginal knowledge, the Lake Mackay {{hare-wallaby}} {{was covered}} in soft, long, gray fur and had especially long fur covering <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> feet.

5|$|Like other lambeosaurines such as Parasaurolophus and Corythosaurus, Lambeosaurus had a {{distinctive}} crest on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> head. Its nasal cavity ran back through this crest, making it mostly hollow. Many suggestions {{have been made}} for the function or functions of the crest, including housing salt glands, improving the sense of smell, use as a snorkel or air trap, acting as a resonating chamber for making sounds, or being a method for different species or different sexes {{of the same species}} to recognize each other. Social functions such as noisemaking and recognition have become the most widely accepted of the various hypotheses.|$|E
5|$|P. fimbriata in Queensland {{prefers to}} lay eggs on dead, brown leaves about 20millimetres long, {{suspended}} near <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> capture web, and then cover the eggs {{with a sheet}} of silk. If there is no dead leaf available, the female will make a small horizontal silk platform in the capture web, lay the eggs on it, and then cover the eggs. In Northern Territory, P. fimbriata occasionally lays eggs in a dead leaf, but more usually in a silk egg sac on a small horizontal web suspended on the main web.|$|E

Its initial 33 members were recruited from a variety of Breton nationalist organizations, some of them had already served in collaborationist militias. Terms of enlistment specified that it will only engage French opponents within the borders of Brittany. On 15 December, Bezen Kadoudal was renamed into Bezen Perrot (Perrot Unit), in honor of the recently assassinated Breton nationalist Jean-Marie Perrot, German documents record it under the name Bretonische Waffenverband der SS. At <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> strength the unit numbered 80 members the pseudonyms of 65 of whom are recorded. Pseudonyms were used {{in order to protect the}} members' identities. It was headed by Lainé, and his assistants, field commander Ange Péresse and Jean Chanteau, the latter being responsible for intelligence.|$|E
5|$|Phasianidae {{consists}} of the pheasants and their allies. These are terrestrial species, variable in size but generally plump with broad relatively short wings. Many species are gamebirds or have been domesticated as a food source for humans. Turkeys have a distinctive fleshy wattle that hangs from {{the underside of the}} beak and a fleshy protuberance that hangs from <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> beak called a snood. As with many galliform species, the female (the hen) is smaller and much less colorful than the male (the tom).

Grouse inhabit temperate and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. In all of Maryland's species, males are polygamous and have elaborate courtship displays. These heavily built birds have legs feathered to the toes. Most species are year-round residents and do not migrate. Four species of Phasianidae have been recorded in Maryland.|$|E

5|$|The adult jaguar is an apex predator, {{meaning it}} exists at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> food chain {{and is not}} preyed on in the wild. The jaguar has also been termed a {{keystone}} species, as it is assumed, through controlling the population levels of prey such as herbivorous and granivorous mammals, apex felids maintain the structural integrity of forest systems. However, accurately determining what effect species like the jaguar have on ecosystems is difficult, because data must be compared from regions where the species is absent {{as well as its}} current habitats, while controlling for the effects of human activity. It is accepted that mid-sized prey species undergo population increases {{in the absence of the}} keystone predators, and this has been hypothesized to have cascading negative effects. However, field work has shown this may be natural variability and the population increases may not be sustained. Thus, the keystone predator hypothesis is not accepted by all scientists.|$|E
5|$|The plan of Salisbury Cathedral is {{that most}} often {{reproduced}} in architectural histories {{for the purpose of}} comparing English Gothic architecture with that of France, Italy and other countries. It has many features that, on paper at least, are typical. The plan of Worcester Cathedral, for example, closely resembles that of Salisbury. Both have two transepts, a large central tower, a large porch to {{the north side of the}} nave, a cloister to the south, off which opens a polygonal chapter house. Internally, there are also strong visual similarities in the simple lancet windows of the east end and the contrasting profusion of Purbeck marble shafts. But the histories of the two buildings are very different. Salisbury Cathedral took 160 years to complete, from its foundations in 1220 to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> massive spire in 1380. Worcester took 420 years from its Norman crypt of 1084 to its chapel in memory of Prince Arthur in 1504. The history of Worcester is much more representative of the history of most of England’s medieval cathedrals than is that of Salisbury.|$|E

5|$|The plumage of {{the house}} sparrow is mostly {{different}} shades of grey and brown. The sexes exhibit strong dimorphism: the female is mostly buffish above and below, while the male has boldly coloured head markings, a reddish back, and grey underparts. The male has a dark grey crown from <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> bill to its back, and chestnut brown flanking its crown {{on the sides of}} its head. It has black around its bill, on its throat, and on the spaces between its bill and eyes (lores). It has a small white stripe between the lores and crown and small white spots immediately behind the eyes (postoculars), with black patches below and above them. The underparts are pale grey or white, as are the cheeks, ear coverts, and stripes {{at the base of the}} head. The upper back and mantle are a warm brown, with broad black streaks, while the lower back, rump and uppertail coverts are greyish brown.|$|E
5|$|The tuatara has a third eye on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> head {{called the}} parietal eye. It {{has its own}} lens, a parietal plug which resembles a cornea, retina with {{rod-like}} structures, and degenerated nerve connection to the brain. The parietal eye is only visible in hatchlings, which have a translucent patch at the top centre of the skull. After four to six months, it becomes covered with opaque scales and pigment. Its purpose is unknown, {{but it may be}} useful in absorbing ultraviolet rays to produce vitamin D, as well as to determine light/dark cycles, and help with thermoregulation. Of all extant tetrapods, the parietal eye is most pronounced in the tuatara. It is part of the pineal complex, another part of which is the pineal gland, which in tuatara secretes melatonin at night. Some salamanders have been shown to use their pineal bodies to perceive polarised light, and thus determine the position of the sun, even under cloud cover, aiding navigation.|$|E
