25|$|Arbore {{was also}} {{integrated}} on the Boyar Council in 1486, but only returned there in 1498, possibly {{because he was}} too often absent from the country on diplomatic assignments. According to historian Virgil Pâslariuc, he was co-opted <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> supported Stephen's co-ruler and designated successor, Bogdan III, whose claim to the throne was contested by his brothers; and also because he was a distinguished warrior. During the final years of Stephen III's reign, Arbore and Ioan Tăutu became increasingly influential, taking on more and more attributes; by 1503, Arbore had also risen through the Boyar Council, being listed there as the eighth most important boyar. For a while, he was the country's spatharios, or military commander.|$|E
25|$|After 1945, {{he taught}} Latin and Greek as a {{secondary}} school teacher in West Berlin. In between (1947-1949), he taught philosophy at the Dresden University of Technology (Technische Hochschule Dresden), {{but as a}} pugnacious democrat and humanist, he came {{in conflict with the}} authorities of the Soviet occupation zone. As a result, he went back to West Berlin and worked as a secondary school teacher again. There, he became the victim of a slander campaign because of his efforts concerning overcoming the Cold War and got into professional difficulties. In 1959, he was offered a chair as professor for Latin literature, with special consideration of the Greek. (He was unable to teach philosophy <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was a non-Marxist and because of his Dresden experiences.) After the building of the Berlin Wall in August 1961, he had to move from West Berlin to East Berlin with his family in order to continue this work. He was given emeritus status in 1965.|$|E

25|$|Despite being {{admitted}} to the United States, Utah was initially unsuccessful in having its elected representatives and senators seated in the United States Congress. In 1898, Utah elected general authority B.H. Roberts to the United States House of Representatives as a Democrat. Roberts, however, was denied a seat <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was practicing polygamy. In 1903, the Utah legislature selected Reed Smoot, also an LDS general authority but also a monogamist, as its first senator. From 1904 to 1907, the United States Senate {{conducted a series of}} Congressional hearings on whether Smoot should be seated. Eventually, the Senate granted Smoot a seat and allowed him to vote. However, the hearings raised controversy as to whether polygamy had actually been abandoned as claimed in the 1890 Manifesto, and whether the LDS Church continued to exercise influence on Utah politics. In response to these hearings, President of the Church Joseph F. Smith issued a Second Manifesto denying that any post-Manifesto marriages had the church's sanction, and announcing that those entering such marriages in the future would be excommunicated.|$|E
25|$|Pompey and Crassus {{conducted}} the levy for their campaigns in their provinces. This created discontent. Some of the plebeian tribunes instituted {{a suit against}} their lieutenants that was actually aimed at them. They then tried to annul levies and rescind the vote for the proposed campaigns. Pompey was not perturbed because had already sent his lieutenants to Hispania. He had intended to let them deal with Hispania while he would gladly stay in Rome with the pretext {{that he had to}} stay <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was the praefectus annonae. Crassus, instead needed his levy for his campaign against Parthia. He considered using force. The unarmed plebeian tribunes avoided confrontation, but they did criticise him. While Crassus was offering the prayers, which were customary before war, they claimed bad omens. One of the tribunes tried to have Crassus arrested. However, the others objected and while they were arguing Crassus left the city. He then headed for Syria and invaded Parthia. Plutarch thought that Crassus, the richest man in Rome, felt inferior to Pompey and Caesar only in military achievement and added a passion for glory to his greed. His achievements in the Battle of the Colline Gate (82 BC) and in the Third Servile War (71 BC) were now a fading memory. Plutarch also wrote that Caesar wrote to Crassus from Gaul. He approved of his intentions and spurred him to war.|$|E

500|$|Chamberlain {{became a}} member of the Globetrotters team which made history by playing in Moscow in 1959, enjoyed a sold out tour of the USSR and prior to the start of a game at Moscow's Lenin Central Stadium, were greeted by the General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev. One {{particular}} Trotter skit involved Trotters captain Meadowlark Lemon collapsing to the ground, and instead of helping him up, Chamberlain threw him several feet high up in the air and caught him like a doll. [...] " [...] was the strongest athlete who ever lived", the 210-pound Lemon later recounted. In later years, Chamberlain frequently joined the Trotters in the off-season and fondly recalled his time <b>there,</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was no longer jeered at or asked to break records, but just one of several artists who loved to entertain the crowd. On March 9, 2000, Chamberlain's number 13 was retired by the Trotters.|$|E

[...] Some of those locations belong to the Sololá, and the singer revealed that he chose to film the video <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> wanted to [...] "show the real situation of that department", {{which is one of}} the poorest in the country, although being visited yearly by thousands of tourists. [...] About the concept of the video, Arjona commented that [...] "it recreates the battle on a couple when someone starts to say 'is the beginning of the end'. When there is something you don't like from your beloved one, there's two options: The first, hold on to the relationship. The second, go away. Sadly, there's a third one that is created by those who are unsure and that is when, on the conflictive moments, they use a recurrent phrase: It was you." ...|$|E

Unbeknownst to everyone, there is a [...] "mystery man" [...] going around TGS in a black cape completing all of the tasks that Kenneth would do. While Jack is recording a video, he catches Kenneth in his office, revealing that Kenneth has been the one completing all of his old tasks. Kenneth {{says that he is}} <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> knows how much he is needed, but Jack tells him that they do not need him and he must move on with his life. Hurt and bewildered, Kenneth leaves, and Jack says in the video for his unborn child that the exchange between him and Kenneth was really [...] "tough love" [...] and he had just sent Kenneth on a journey. Meanwhile, Kenneth Parcell gets a phone call from Angie, who is delirious on pain killers. [...] At the same time, as Tracy is on the game show, Angie tells Kenneth to find Tracy. [...] Unable to do so, Kenneth takes a cardboard cut-out of Tracy and pretends to be him as she is giving birth until Tracy comes in and pushes Kenneth out of the way. [...] Later, Jack tells Kenneth that he is truly needed back at TGS and offers to talk to human resources to get his job back, but Kenneth refuses and says he will re-apply to the page program, following the proper procedures.|$|E

2500|$|The North and South Doors {{are often}} called Deacons' Doors because the deacons use them frequently. Icons of sainted deacons are often {{depicted}} on these doors (particularly St. Stephen the Protomartyr and St. Ephrem the Syrian). [...] Alternatively, {{they may be}} called Angels' Doors, and the Archangels Michael and Gabriel are often depicted there. [...] The South Door is typically the [...] "entrance" [...] door, and Michael is depicted <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> is the [...] "Defender"; the North Door is the [...] "exit", and Gabriel is depicted here because [...] he is the [...] "Messenger" [...] of God.

In 1858, he was appointed official Dutch teacher of his family's domain, Nakatsu, and was sent to Edo to teach the family's vassals there.|$|E
2500|$|Nine Inch Nails' second {{full-length}} album, The Downward Spiral, {{entered the}} Billboard 200 chart in 1994 at number two, and remains the highest-selling Nine Inch Nails release in America. To record the album, Reznor rented {{and moved into}} the 10050 Cielo Drive mansion, where the 1969 Manson Family murders took place. He built a studio space in the house, which he renamed Le Pig, after the word that was scrawled {{on the front door}} in Sharon Tate's blood by her murderers. Reznor told Entertainment Weekly that, despite the notoriety attached to the house, he chose to record <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> [...] "looked at a lot of places, and this just happened to be the one I liked most".

2500|$|A 2001 {{review by}} John Ryle {{concerned}} the Kapuściński memoir entitled The Shadow of the Sun {{released in the}} same year. Ryle alleged that questions about the reliability of Kapuściński’s reportage began with The Emperor. Scrutinizing Kapuściński’s translation of expressions of fealty by Ethiopian courtiers, Ryle said that [...] "native speakers of Amharic say that these honorifics correspond to no known expressions in their language." [...] Ryle wrote that he visited Ethiopia in the 1990s when the action of The Shadow of the Sun was taking place. He said there were inaccuracies in the story, for example, that Mengistu’s generals did not escape justice and that the 'academics' among them were few and far in between. Ryle noticed that the initials of Kapuściński's informants did not correspond to the names of witnesses {{in the trial of}} the Derg in Addis Ababa. He added that Kapuściński’s description of the capital devoid of bookstores did not correspond to what he has seen on his last visit <b>there,</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> found six bookstores there. He also disputed Kapuściński's assertion that Haile Selassie did not read books by saying he had a library, was well read, and annotated documents.|$|E
