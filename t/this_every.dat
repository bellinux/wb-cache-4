The ingredients are typically rich in taste while remaining affordable to the general public The savoury dishes of Sicily are viewed to be healthy, using fresh vegetables and fruits, such as tomatoes, artichokes, olives (including olive oil), citrus, apricots, aubergines, onions, beans, raisins commonly coupled with seafood, freshly caught from the surrounding coastlines, including tuna, sea bream, sea bass, cuttlefish, swordfish, sardines, and others.|$|E
25|$|In {{other parts}} of the world, a big effect will be low yields of grain {{according}} to the World Food Trade Model, specifically in the low latitude regions where much of the developing world is located. From this the price of grain will rise, along with the developing nations trying to grow the grain. Due to <b>this,</b> <b>every</b> 2–2.5% price hike will increase the number of hungry people by 1%. Low crop yields are just one of the problem facing farmers in the low latitudes and tropical regions. The timing and length of the growing seasons, when farmers plant their crops, are going to be changing dramatically, per the USDA, due to unknown changes in soil temperature and moisture conditions.|$|E

Kandasamy Padayatchi utters <b>this</b> <b>every</b> time before he murders or assaults a person. According to Kamal, the characterisation of Nallasivam {{was inspired by the}} life of Communist playwright, actor, director, lyricist and theorist Safdar Hashmi, who was chiefly associated with his work with street theatre in India. Hashmi died on 2 January 1989 after being attacked by members of the Indian National Congress while staging a play, Halla Bol. S.Anand of Outlook magazine notes that Kamal's views on humanism in the film were also inspired by those of Charlie Chaplin. M. Kalyanaraman and Abdullah Nurullah of The Times of India opined that Nallasivam was [...] "akin to" [...] street theatre artist Pralayan.|$|E
500|$|In December 2003, his {{traction}} engine {{was now in}} working order and planning for the new series commenced. [...] Dibnah's illness necessitated that he sleep in hotels, rather than the living van the engine would tow during the trip. [...] For the long distances between locations, the engine would be transported {{on the back of}} a low loader. [...] Dibnah's engine suffered early mechanical problems; it could barely tow the fully loaded living van uphill, as the cylinder had been placed very slightly closer to the footplate than it should have been. As a result of <b>this,</b> <b>every</b> time the piston was fully forward it covered the steam inlet port. [...] The engine was repaired, and with some minor engineering work to one of the pistons was brought up to full power. [...] The team was joined by Dibnah's sons, Jack and Roger.|$|E

Apart from the UN and a few newsreaders who mention <b>this</b> <b>every</b> year, people don’t even know this day exists. It’s also to make people realize it’s not just about {{volunteering}} to go {{and live in the}} Congo for four years. It’s as much about working a soup kitchen as it is helping an elderly person. Contributing something positive doesn’t have to be a lifelong commitment; it can just be daily gestures. So, it was about giving the whole issue perspective... One video and a message aren't going to save everything. But when you say things together, maybe the message will be heard and hopefully will provoke action. Inherently people are good, and inherently people are distracted and somewhat lazy, so it comes down to how do you get people’s attention." ...|$|E

Pilot Viruet of The A.V. Club graded the episode an A–, writing that it was [...] "full of funny moments throughout." [...] Viruet felt that [...] "Boyz 4 Now" [...] was most successful at building the relationship between Tina and Louise, noting that the latter's [...] "three-hour crush throws her for such a loop that she emerges with a newfound respect for Tina who deals with <b>this</b> <b>every</b> day."

500|$|Uroš Predić (1857–1953) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} 19th- and 20th-century Serbian realists. A native of Orlovat, a village in the Banat region of Austria-Hungary, Predić drew scenes of life in the village throughout his career. One of the more frequent sights during his stays there was of intoxicated young men returning from the pub at dawn and waking up the whole village. In painting the composition, Predić was not only attempting to realistically depict contemporary village life but also to convey a message. [...] "I observed <b>this</b> <b>every</b> day", he explained. [...] "I said to myself there must be some way of telling these people to what an unhappy level they have descended and have a moral impact on them, capturing all the bad habits of my compatriots." [...] Predić had expressed disapproval of the villagers' behavior in an earlier work, Clients in Front of a Lawyer's Door (1886).|$|E

500|$|To do <b>this,</b> <b>every</b> able-bodied Athenian male {{would be}} {{required}} to man the ships. This in turn meant that the Athenians must prepare to abandon Athens. Persuading the Athenians to take this course was undoubtedly {{one of the highlights of}} Themistocles's career. As Holland has it: [...] "What precise heights of oratory he attained, what stirring and memorable phrases he pronounced, we have no way of knowing...only by the effect it had on the assembly can we gauge what surely must have been its electric and vivifying quality—for Themistocles' audacious proposals, when put to the vote, were ratified. The Athenian people, facing the gravest moment of peril in their history, committed themselves once and for all to the alien element of the sea, and put their faith in a man whose ambitions many had long profoundly dreaded." [...] His proposals accepted, Themistocles issued orders for the women and children of Athens to be sent to the city of Troezen, safely inside the Peloponnesus. He was then able to travel to a meeting of the Allies, at which he proposed his strategy; with the Athenian fleet fully committed to the defence of Greece, the other Allies accepted his proposals.|$|E

They did <b>this</b> <b>every</b> single night so Washington could command his soldiers in the morning. Colonel Alexander Hamilton and General Nathanael Greene were of great help in assisting Steuben in drafting a training program for the Army. The Baron's willingness and ability to work with the men, as well as his use of profanity (in several different languages), made him popular among the soldiers. It is here he met his reputed future lover, Captain Benjamin Walker.

2500|$|Kabbalistic thought {{extended}} Biblical and Midrashic {{notions that}} God enacted Creation through the Hebrew language {{and through the}} Torah into a full linguistic mysticism. In <b>this,</b> <b>every</b> Hebrew letter, word, number, even accent on words of the Hebrew Bible contain esoteric meanings, describing the spiritual dimensions within exoteric ideas, and it teaches the hermeneutic methods of interpretation for ascertaining these meanings. Names of God in Judaism have further prominence, though fluidity of meaning turns the whole Torah into a Divine name. As the Hebrew name of things is the channel of their lifeforce, parallel to the sephirot, so concepts such as [...] "holiness" [...] and [...] "mitzvot" [...] embody ontological Divine immanence, as God can be known in manifestation as well as transcendence. The infinite potential of meaning in the Torah, as in the Ein Sof, {{is reflected in the}} symbol of the two trees of the Garden of Eden; the Torah of the Tree of Knowledge is the external, Halachic Torah, through which mystics can perceive the unlimited Torah of the Tree of Life.
