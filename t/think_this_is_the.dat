5|$|Each year, {{thousands}} of outdoor enthusiasts attempt to summit Mount Adams. The false summits and broad summit plateau have disheartened many climbers as this inscription {{on a rock}} at Piker’s Peak indicates. “You are a piker if you <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> summit. Don’t crab, the mountain was here first.” Crampons and ice axes are needed on many routes because of glaciers and the route’s steepness. Aside from crevasses on the more difficult glacier routes, the biggest hazard is the loose rocks and boulders which are easily dislodged and a severe hazard for climbers below. These falling rocks are especially dangerous for climbers on the precipitous east faces and the steep headwalls of {{the north and west}} sides. Routes in those areas should only be climbed early in the season under as ideal conditions as can be had. Other hazards faced by climbers on Adams include sudden storms and clouds, avalanches, altitude sickness, and inexperience. Climbing Mount Adams can be dangerous {{for a variety of reasons}} and people have died in pursuit of the summit while many others have had close calls.|$|E

500|$|The uncredited Casey Robinson {{assisted}} with {{three weeks of}} rewrites, including contributing the series of meetings between Rick and Ilsa in the cafe.

500|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the Canadian dates, they embarked on a brief U.S. leg of their tour, which was to be followed by a break before more shows in the fall. But before their last show—in Southaven, Mississippi—Ben Blackwell (Jack's nephew and the group's archivist) says that Meg approached him and said, [...] "This is the last White Stripes show". He asked if she meant of the tour, but she responded, [...] "No. I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> last show, period."

Byron looked at him steadily, and said, half smiling, in Italian—Oh questa è una bella scena.|$|R

500|$|Another {{cultural}} reference {{appeared in}} a scene when Emma hears Leroy (who is actually Grumpy) whistling Whistle While You Work (the song used in the 1937 film version of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs), indicating its acknowledged ties to Disney, whose subsidiary ABC Studios {{also happens to be}} the production company behind Once Upon a Time, since Disney has allowed them access to their fairy tale characters and properties for use in the series. [...] "They've given us license," [...] Kitsis said. [...] "I could be wrong, but I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> first time anyone's shown Snow White with a sword, or pregnant."

Michael C. Hall called the ending a [...] "really bold stroke" [...] that would reset the stage of the series just as the Dexter Morgan character began to feel he could live with an emotional connection to his wife and family.

Alexander <b>thinks</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most attractive [...] of Pound's work. Chinese critic Wai-lim Yip writes of it: [...] "One can easily excommunicate Pound from the Forbidden City of Chinese studies, but {{it seems clear that}} in his dealings with Cathay, even when he <b>is</b> given only <b>the</b> barest details, he is able to get into the central concerns of the original author by what we may perhaps call a kind of clairvoyance." ...|$|R

500|$|Heller was {{responsible}} for writing the episode's voice-over, despite his dislike of the task. He said that despite it being his [...] "400th version," [...] he was [...] "still not happy with it." [...] He believed that an early scene in which spoils are distributed from a cart in front of Pompey represented the first real sense of how the series would depict city life. He said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> first time that we get sense of the version of Rome that the show is pushing," [...] which {{was a very different}} version than viewers may have been used to. To him, Rome was [...] "colorful and painted" [...] and cosmopolitan. A later scene featuring Cicero the Younger in the Senate proved difficult to film because of the large number of Italian extras who did not speak English. In the DVD audio commentary, he said that [...] "this is one of those scenes where you need really great assistant directors, because all of these Italian extras who have no idea whatsoever what [...] saying, so to keep them interested and focused and concentrated on what's going on is a real trick." ...|$|E
