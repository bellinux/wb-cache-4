40|$|<b>The</b> {{strategic}} <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{human resource}} (HR) function {{is regarded as}} crucial {{in the literature on}} (strategic) human resource management ((S) HRM). Evidence on the contextual or structural influences on this integration is, however, limited. The structural implications of unionism are particularly intriguing given the evolution of study of the employment relationship. Pluralism is typically seen as antithetical to SHRM, and unions as an impediment to <b>the</b> strategic <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> HR functions, but there are also suggestions in the literature that unionism might facilitate <b>the</b> strategic <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> HR. This paper deploys large-scale international survey evidence to examine the organization-level influence of unionism on this strategic integration, allowing for other established and plausible influences. The analysis reveals that exceptionally, where the organization-level role of unions is particularly contested, unionism does impede <b>the</b> strategic <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> HR. However, it is the predominance of the facilitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strategic <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> HR by unionism which is most remarkable...|$|R

5|$|The MAM is a {{critical}} signaling, metabolic, and trafficking hub in the cell that allows for <b>the</b> <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> ER and mitochondrial physiology. Coupling between these organelles is not simply structural but functional as well and critical for overall cellular physiology and homeostasis.

5|$|Being {{designed}} for low-level operations, the Tornado required modification {{to perform in}} medium level operations that the RAF adopted in the 1990s. The RAF's GR1 fleet was extensively re-manufactured as Tornado GR4s. Upgrades on Tornado GR4s included a Forward looking infrared, a wide-angle HUD (Head-up display), improved cockpit displays, NVG (Night vision devices) capabilities, new avionics, and a Global Positioning System receiver. The upgrade eased <b>the</b> <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> new weapons and sensors which were purchased in parallel, including the Storm Shadow cruise missile, the Brimstone anti-tank missile, Paveway III laser-guided bombs and the RAPTOR reconnaissance pod was integrated. The first flight of a Tornado GR4 was on 4 April 1997, on 31 October 1997 the RAF accepted the first delivery and deliveries were completed in 2003. In 2005, the RSAF opted to have their Tornado IDSs undergo a series of upgrades to become equivalent to the RAF's GR4 configuration. On 21 December 2007 BAE signed a £210m contract for CUSP, the Capability Upgrade Strategy (Pilot). This project would see RAF GR4/4A improved in two phases, starting with <b>the</b> <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> the Paveway IV bomb and a communications upgrade, followed by a new tactical datalink in Phase B.|$|E

50|$|In an {{ordinary}} integral {{there is a}} function to be integrated (the integrand) and a region of space over which to integrate the function (<b>the</b> domain <b>of</b> <b>integration).</b> <b>The</b> process <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> consists <b>of</b> adding up {{the values of the}} integrand for each point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domain <b>of</b> <b>integration.</b> Making this procedure rigorous requires a limiting procedure, where <b>the</b> domain <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> is divided into smaller and smaller regions. For each small region, the value of the integrand cannot vary much, so it may be replaced by a single value. In a functional integral <b>the</b> domain <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> is a space of functions. For each function, the integrand returns a value to add up.
