Thus, the sign of its overall effect is unknown and could be found only empirically from the historical data. This paper analyzes the relation between macroeconomic uncertainty and <b>total</b> investment in <b>Romania</b> over the period 2000 - 2008. As a source of uncertainty, it considers different measures of volatility in prices and exchange rate from autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (GARCH) models.

The results prove a nonlinear effect of uncertainty on investment. investment, uncertainty, irreversibility, economic instability, inflation, exchange rate...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the evolution of two characteristics, total employment and <b>total</b> population in <b>Romania</b> and in the European Union. The chosen period for analysis is 2010 - 2015. The purpose was, also, to determine if there is any relationship between the two above mentioned characteristics. The analysis showed that the population at European Union level increases almost every year, whereas in Romania it keeps decreasing. Pearson’s correlation coefficient level points out that there is a strong link between the two characteristics, this meaning that the total number of people influences the total number of employees, both in Romania and in the European Union. There was also presented a prediction, made by EUROSTAT, regarding the future evolution of the total population which shows a dramatic decrease in Romania...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors analyze the migratory {{movement}} of population from Romania. Demographic {{dynamics of the}} last decade confirms that Romania's population declined. The demographic developments in Romania have mainly economic reasons (examples : migration, low birth rate, rural - urban migration). The comparative analysis of statistical data obtained in the population censuses of 2002 and 2011 shows that the most of the Romanian communities have lost population due to a negative natural and migratory growth. Fron the situation of the absent population (migrants) {{at the time of the}} population census, between 2002 and 2011 is that the number of those who have left home for longer periods has increased exponentially. Most of those absents from their home at the time of the last population census were living abroad. Romania needs a realistic vision of economic and social development in the coming decades. In defining and naming a strategy for sustainable development, population is the central element and from this perspective one of the strategy component should be to stop the demographic skidding. Simultaneously with the decrease of the <b>total</b> population, <b>Romania</b> records a demographic aging trend. The causes are both negative natural growth (low birth rate combined with high mortality) and also the migration phenomena. Projections show that these trends will persist on the medium and long term...|$|R
