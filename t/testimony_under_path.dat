50|$|In {{terms of}} the witness' {{testimony}} {{as a means of}} legal proof, the judge will compare a witness’ testimony against other witness testimonies or other means of proof to determine whether the testimony is true. In the process, he also considers all other factors that affect the witness’ credibility. A witness usually makes a <b>testimony</b> <b>under</b> oath. However, a <b>testimony</b> not made <b>under</b> oath can still be admitted as supplemental legal evidence if it is consistent with a <b>testimony</b> made <b>under</b> oath.|$|R

50|$|The {{principal}} {{functions of}} a commissioners' or quorum Court are legislative. Although {{referred to as}} courts, they generally exercise only limited judicial powers in Texas and Missouri and none in Arkansas.

In their conclusions, the U.S. military was completely exonerated, and blame for the Hawaiian Revolution was placed squarely on the shoulders of Queen Liliuokalani.|$|R

50|$|While {{a person}} may be insulted, and his {{political}} position subjected to question, the person so impugned has not been discredited until the allegations against him have been proved correct. One such discredit was the Impeachment of Bill Clinton. The allegations brought against the Chief Executive were damaging, but did not comprise discredit until enough substance arose from the <b>testimony</b> <b>under</b> oath of Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky to raise genuine questions of the credibility of President Clinton.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a BIST scheme {{for the detection}} of path delay faults. It differs from the traditional BIST schemes which aim at stuck-at faults by offering higher capability of two-pattern generation. The TPG scheme produces test sequences having exactly the same robust path delay fault coverage as single-input-change test sequences. By determining nonadjacent inputs, the reduction of both test length and area overhead can be achieved. Signature analysis <b>under</b> <b>path</b> delay fault is also discussed. Based on true-value simulation, error patterns <b>under</b> <b>path</b> delay fault model were obtained and were used in aliasing estimation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Counsel stated that information supplied [...] "did not encompass all of the material questions that had been asked of you" [...] to which Ahern replied [...] "I accept that, yes". On 14 September 2007, inconsistencies in Ahern's statements to the Tribunal emerged, after he changed his story on the infamous IR£25,000 dig-outs.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of criminal cases in Wisconsin are begun by a district attorney filing a criminal complaint, some cases are commenced {{as the result of a}} grand jury or John Doe investigation.

50|$|The {{district}} court took its cue from Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, which had solidified a gatekeeping role for trial judges in admitting expert <b>testimony.</b> <b>Under</b> Daubert, certain {{factors contribute to}} the reliability, and hence the admissibility, of expert testimony, {{one of which is}} the general validity of the expert's methods. The {{district court}} found the tire expert's methods not to be scientifically valid, and hence excluded his testimony. This resulted in a conclusion that Kumho Tire would rightly prevail. The Carmichaels appealed to the Eleventh Circuit.|$|R
