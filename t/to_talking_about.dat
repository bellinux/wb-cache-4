5|$|Understanding the Massey Lectures {{were part}} of the Canadian culture, Gopnik, who was born in Philadelphia but lived in Montreal between the ages of 10 to 25, wanted a topic that would be {{relevant}} to Canadians but also have universal appeal: winter. Winter had appeared as a theme or setting in many of his previous writings, and he especially looked forward <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> ice hockey. Gopnik spent the next year researching and writing the book, alongside another non-fiction book he was working on at the time: The Table Comes First: Family, France, and the Meaning of Food. This other book was released shortly after Winter, and purposefully contained one identical sentence.|$|E

Kingston reverts <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> her life in America and compares it to the story of Fa Mu Lan. She cannot gather the courage to speak up against her racist boss, let alone save her people in China. In the end, Kingston decides that she and Fa Mu Lan are similar.|$|E

He confronts his own issues as captain of England under pressure and under fire {{at the top of his}} game. Freddie reveals the stigma attached <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> depression in the face of an often unforgiving public.|$|E
500|$|The remix {{has also}} {{garnered}} positive reviews; Lowe noted that [...] "Kanye West, Lupe Fiasco, and Pusha T {{make an appearance}} on a somewhat more enjoyable remixed version of [...] ", which added a [...] "nice outside perspective to the otherwise tiresome track". Tom Breihan of The Village Voice called the remix [...] "pretty great" [...] compared to the [...] "horrible hammering" [...] of the original song. He criticized West's lyrics, saying he was [...] "back <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> girls on his verse again [...] {{without any of the}} humane warmth he used to sometimes bring." [...] The song was number 32 on Rolling Stones list of the 100 Best Songs of 2008.|$|E
500|$|On July 20, Thome hit {{his first}} home {{run with the}} Orioles, his 610th of all time moving him past Sosa for seventh place all-time, against the Indians at Progressive Field. On August 6, Thome {{was placed on the}} 15-day {{disabled}} list with a herniated disk; he remained on the DL until September 21. In his first game back, he drove in the game-winning RBI in extra innings against the Boston Red Sox. After beating the Indians in a game where he hit his 611th career home run, Thome said, [...] "There's a lot [...] memories. I've had great memories on that side and then coming in here as an opponent against them. Any time you come home, they say, it's very special. It's even more special to get the W's. That's, I think, the main thing. The bottom line is I played here a long time." [...] Orioles teammates remarked at Thome's commitment <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the game while in the dugout. Thome remarked, [...] "I talk the game. When I sit in the dugout during games, I talk baseball to these guys. They'll ask, 'Hey, what's this pitcher like?' or 'What about the game?' 'What about all those Indians teams you were on?' I did it to Eddie Murray {{when he was in his}} 40s." [...] The Orioles made the playoffs, but lost in five games to the Yankees during the AL Division Series. Thome hit [...]133 in the playoffs with no home runs or RBIs.|$|E

Furthermore, there is a contrary opinion stating that porn production is not necessarily unethical or degrading. According to Lynn Comella, a women's studies professor at UNLV, presenting demeaning practices as representative of the entire porn industry is [...] "akin <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Hollywood while only referencing spaghetti Westerns." ...|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} for Pacific Northwest periodical [...] "The Rocket" [...] in 1996, {{he said that he}} drove a combine harvester. He came from a dysfunctional family that he tried to avoid, and was using drugs heavily by the age of 18, having already been arrested and sentenced to one year's imprisonment for drug-related crimes. He got out of jail by taking a year-long rehabilitation course. Around this time he met and befriended Van Conner with whom he would eventually form the Screaming Trees. At this point his relationship with the Conner brothers was limited <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> music and working for their parents' electronics hardware store.|$|E
2500|$|Lou: {{played by}} Phil Leeds, Lou is a feisty {{old man who}} is {{introduced}} in Season Seven's [...] "The Lyin' King". In that episode, Joe, in order to assuage his guilt over going to a strip club later, volunteers at the senior citizens' home, where he is assigned {{to spend time with}} Lou. After spending a moment complaining about how lousy nursing home life is, Lou manages to guilt trip Joe into taking him to the strip club with him. Though Joe is somewhat tolerant of Lou, Brian is decidedly less so, referring to him derisively as [...] "Yoda" [...] (due to Lou's shrivelled physical appearance). Lou, in return, makes it clear he does not care for Brian either. Lou is also prone <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> a rift he had in the past with his brother Harry, prompting his catchphrase, [...] "He screwed me blue!" [...] Lou was originally intended as a one-shot appearance, but proved so popular that he was brought back in the show's final season, where we are also introduced to his brother Harry, played by Abe Vigoda.|$|E
