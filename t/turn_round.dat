5|$|The {{case is a}} tubular {{structure}} made of silk, secreted from salivary glands {{near the mouth of}} the larva, and is started soon after the egg hatches. Various reinforcements may be incorporated into its structure, the nature of the materials and design depending on the larva's genetic makeup; this means that caddifly larvae can be recognised by their cases down to family, and even genus level. The materials used include grains of sand, larger fragments of rock, bark, sticks, leaves, seeds and mollusc shells. These are neatly arranged and stuck onto the outer surface of the silken tube. As the larva grows, more material is added at the front, and the larva can <b>turn</b> <b>round</b> in the tube and trim the rear end so that it does not drag along the substrate.|$|E

25|$|Following Darwin's {{marriage}} to Emma in January 1839, they shared discussions about Christianity for many years. Unitarianism emphasised inner feeling which overrode {{the authority of}} religious texts or doctrine, and her beliefs resulted from intensive study and questioning. They socialised with the Unitarian clergymen James Martineau and John James Tayler, and read their works {{as well as those}} of other Unitarian and liberal Anglican authors such as Francis William Newman whose Phases of faith described a spiritual journey from Calvinism to theism, all part of widespread and heated debate on the authority of Anglicanism. In Downe Emma attended the Anglican village church, but as a Unitarian had the family <b>turn</b> <b>round</b> in silence when the Trinitarian Nicene Creed was recited.|$|E

25|$|In {{both males}} and females the legs are short and sturdy, with an {{enlarged}} tarsomere on the first pair, containing the silk-producing glands. The abdomen has ten segments, with a pair of cerci on the final segment. These cerci are highly sensitive to touch, and allow the animal to navigate while moving backwards through the gallery tunnels, which are too narrow to allow the insect to <b>turn</b> <b>round.</b> Because morphology is so similar between species, it makes species identification extremely difficult. For this reason, the main form of taxonomic identification used in the past has been close observation of distinctive copulatory structures of males, (although this method is now thought by some entomologists and taxonomists as giving insufficient classification detail). Although males never eat during their adult stage, they do have mouthparts similar to the females. These mouthparts are used to hold onto the female during copulation.|$|E
25|$|In response, AET {{once again}} criticsed OFSTED, {{saying that the}} Ofsted judgements were unfairly {{negative}} and that many of its schools {{had a history of}} poor performance and would require time to <b>turn</b> <b>round.</b> Ian Comfort the CEO also directly queried the professionalism of OFSTED by claiming that OFSTED had unfairly turned the 'generally positive oral feedback' given at the time of inspections, into 'far more negative statements' in the final OFSTED letter which criticised standards at AET. In comments to the Parliamentary Select Committee Ian Comfort also queried the appropriateness of having both OFSTED and the DfE involved in inspecting school standards as it put 'unnecessary pressure' on AET schools. In contrast to Ian Comfort other CEO's of Multi Academy Trusts, such as Dame Rachel de Souza have publicly stated that they are very happy with how the DfE and OFSTED work together to hold schools accountable.|$|E
25|$|The five-needle telegraph, {{which was}} mainly, if not entirely, due to Wheatstone, {{was similar to}} that of Schilling, and based on the {{principle}} enunciated by André-Marie Ampère – that is to say, the current was sent into the line by completing the circuit of the battery with a make and break key, and at the other end it passed through a coil of wire surrounding a magnetic needle free to <b>turn</b> <b>round</b> its centre. According as one pole of the battery or the other was applied to the line by means of the key, the current deflected the needle to one side or the other. There were five separate circuits actuating five different needles. The latter were pivoted in rows across the middle of a dial shaped like a diamond, and having the letters of the alphabet arranged upon {{it in such a way}} that a letter was literally pointed out by the current deflecting two of the needles towards it.|$|E

25|$|In the box T are two wheels (as in Dr Long's sphere) and two pinions, whose axes {{come out}} at V and U; either {{of which may be}} turned by the small winch W. When the winch is put upon the axis V, and turn backward, the {{terrestrial}} globe, with its horizon and celestial meridian, keep at rest; and the whole sphere of circles turns round from east, by south, to west, carrying the sun Y, and moon Z, round the same way, and causing them to rise above and set below the horizon. But when the winch is put upon the axis U, and turned forward, the sphere with the sun and moon keep at rest; and the earth, with its horizon and meridian, <b>turn</b> <b>round</b> from horizon to the sun and moon, to which these bodies came when the earth kept at rest, and they were carried round it; showing that they rise and set in the same points of the horizon, and at the same times in the hour circle, whether the motion be in the earth or in the heaven. If the earthly globe be turned, the hour-index goes round its hour-circle; but if the sphere be turned, the hour-circle goes round below the index.|$|E
25|$|Force C rendezvoused with Force A1 (Rear Admiral Rawling) at the Kythera Channel, where {{air attacks}} inflicted damage on both forces. A bomb struck HMS Warspite and the {{destroyer}} Greyhound was sunk. King sent HMS Kandahar and Kingston {{to pick up}} survivors, while the cruisers Gloucester and Fiji provided anti-aircraft support. Their commander {{did not know of}} the shortage of anti-aircraft ammunition in Gloucester and Fiji, which were down to 18 and 30 percent, respectively, four hours before they were detached to support the destroyers. Gloucester was hit by several bombs at 15:50 and had to be left behind due to the air attacks; the ship was sunk and 22 officers and 700 ratings were killed. The air attacks on Force A1 and Force C continued, two bombs hit the battleship HMS Valiant and another hit Fiji disabling her at 18:45. A Junkers 88 flown by Lieutenant Gerhard Brenner dropped three bombs on Fiji, sinking her at 20:15. Five hundred survivors were rescued by Kandahar and Kingston that night. The Royal Navy had lost two cruisers and a destroyer but had managed to force the invasion fleet to <b>turn</b> <b>round.</b> Royal Navy AA gunners shot down five Ju-87s and five Ju-88s and damaged sixteen more, some of which crash-landed upon their return to base on the night of 21/22 May.|$|E

Knutson, meanwhile, was positive regarding the graphics, art, and animation: he called them [...] "nearly flawless" [...] and praised the realism they brought to the inherently fantastical skateboarding genre. Williams said that [...] "THUGs cityscapes are incredibly well designed" [...] and singled out the GameCube version of Underground as exceptionally well rendered. Rybicki called the levels [...] "big and beautiful". Knutson commended the soundtrack's large size and the sound effects' realism. Perry appreciated the [...] "hilariously hurtful" [...] injury sounds and the extensive song list. By contrast, IGN's Craig Harris praised the graphics of the Game Boy Advance version but was more mixed on the soundtrack.|$|E

This was reminiscent of William Jervis Livingstone and, {{as was the case}} with in 1915 with Livingstone, Kincaid-Smith paid the price of following Bruce’s instructions while Bruce escaped official censure. Rather than allow Kincaid-Smith to provoke an outright revolt, the Nyasaland government ordered his expulsion in 1939.|$|E

2500|$|Some theonyms, proper {{names and}} other {{terminology}} of the Mitanni exhibit close similarities to Indo-Aryan, suggesting that an Indo-Aryan elite imposed itself over the Hurrian {{population in the}} course of the Indo-Aryan expansion. In a treaty between the Hittites and the Mitanni, the deities Mitra, Varuna, Indra, and Nasatya (Ashvins) are invoked. Kikkuli's horse training text includes technical terms such as aika (eka, one), tera (tri, three), panza (pancha, five), satta (sapta, seven), na (nava, nine), vartana (vartana, <b>turn,</b> <b>round</b> in the horse race).
