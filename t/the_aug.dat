40|$|The {{bacteriophage}} T 4 regA {{protein is}} a translational repressor of {{a subset of}} phage mRNAs. We show here that purified regA protein binds specifically to target mRNAs near <b>the</b> initiating <b>AUG</b> and occludes binding of ribosomes. Translational repression by regA protein diminishes expression of many genes whose mRNA sequences around <b>the</b> initiating <b>AUG</b> codons are different. A comparison of nucleotide sequences from several regA-repressed mRNAs suggests that <b>the</b> initiating <b>AUG</b> is an important, but not sufficient, sequence for regA binding...|$|R

2500|$|The {{methionine}} codon AUG is {{also the}} most common start codon. A [...] "Start" [...] codon is message for a ribosome that signals the initiation of protein translation from mRNA when <b>the</b> <b>AUG</b> codon is in a Kozak consensus sequence. As a consequence, methionine is often incorporated into the N-terminal position of proteins in eukaryotes and archaea during translation, although it can be removed by post-translational modification. In bacteria, the derivative N-formylmethionine is used as the initial amino acid.|$|E
2500|$|On October 28, the Cardinals {{finished}} off their amazing, end-of-season run, [...] starting after <b>the</b> <b>Aug</b> 24 game {{when they were}} 10 games behind for the NL Central Division lead. [...] They defeated the Texas Rangers 4 games to 3, with a 6–2 win in Game 7 of the World Series at their Busch Stadium home in front of 47,399 fans. [...] It was the 36th time a team won the World Series in a Game 7 (or Game 8). [...] The final out was made when David Murphy flew out to left field to give the Cardinals their eleventh world championship. David Freese, a graduate of Lafayette High School in St. Louis, won the MVP award for both the NLCS, and then for the World Series, {{as well as the}} Babe Ruth Award. [...] He knocked in a record 21 RBIs in his post-season. [...] Chris Carpenter set a franchise record for most wins (four) in a single postseason. [...] Carpenter, 9–2 overall in his Cardinals postseason career, ran his home postseason mark to 7–0 with a 2.15 ERA. [...] Tony La Russa became only the ninth manager in major-league history to win at least three World Series.|$|E

2500|$|China {{pledged to}} [...] "Deliver Clean Energy Towards a Harmonious World" [...] {{and that by}} 2008, {{measurements}} of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide would meet World Health Organization standards and airborne particle density would be reduced {{to the level of}} major cities in developed countries, however the IOC stated that Beijing had so far met only WHO 2005 interim guidelines, which are significantly less restrictive, and that [...] "Official data during <b>the</b> <b>Aug.</b> 8 to Aug. 24 Olympic period indicates air quality was actually worse in 2006 and 2007 than in 2000 and 2001." [...] An analysis of August 2007 data found that Beijing's air registered 123 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter, more than double the WHO guideline of 50 micrograms per cubic meter for short-term exposure. China's initial failure prior to the games to meet these standards has caused concern among some Olympics athletes, particularly long distance runners such as world marathon record holder Haile Gebrselassie, considered the world's greatest long distance runner, who has said he will skip the long-distance running event in Beijing because of the city's poor air quality and fears his health could be damaged by running through the streets of the Chinese capital, a decision he would later regret. Despite the initial concerns over the air quality, the Beijing air had improved to healthy levels of particle matter by {{the first week of the}} games, and officials stated that the particles were actually mostly caused by moisture.|$|E
6000|$|I {{had from}} you a shortish time since a very {{beautiful}} and interesting letter--into the ink {{to thank you for}} which my pen has been perpetually about to dip, and now comes the further thrill of your [...] "quaint" [...] little picture card with its news of the Paris winter and the romantic rue de Varenne; on which the pen straightway plunges into the fluid. This is really charming and uplifting news, and I applaud the free sweep of your [...] "line of life" [...] with all my heart. We shall be almost neighbours, and I will most assuredly hie me as promptly as possible across the scant interspace of the Channel, the Pas-de-Calais &c: where the very first question on which I shall beset you will be your adventure and impression of Nohant--as to which I burn and yearn for fond particulars. Perhaps if you have the proper Vehicle of Passion--as I make no doubt--you will be going there once more--in which case do take me! And such a suave and convenient crossing as I meanwhile wish you--and such a provision of philosophy laid up, in advance, for use in, and about, rue Barbet de Jouy! You will have finished your new fiction, I [...] "presume"--if it isn't presumptuous--before embarking? and I do so for the right of the desire to congratulate, in that case, and envy and sympathise--being in all sorts of embarras now, myself, over the finish of many things. I pant for the start of that work and languish to take it up. I think I have had no chance to tell you how much I admired your single story in <b>the</b> <b>Aug.</b> Scribner--beautifully done, I thought, and full of felicities and achieved values and pictures. All the same, with the rue de Varenne &c., don't go in too much for the French or the [...] "Franco-American" [...] subject--the real field of your extension is here--it has far more fusability with our native and primary material; between which and French elements there is, I hold, a disparity as complete as between a life led in trees, say, and a life led in--sea-depths, or in other words between that of climbers and swimmers--or (crudely) that of monkeys and fish. Is the Play Thing meanwhile climbing or swimming?--I take much interest in its fate. But you will tell me of these things--in February! It will be then I shall scramble over. I go home an hour or two hence (to stay as still as possible) after a night--only--spent in town. The perpetual summonses and solicitations of London (some of which have to be met) are at times a maddening worry--or almost. I am wondering if you are not feeling just now perhaps a good deal, at Lenox, in the apparently delightful old 1840 way--a good snowstorm ending, and the Westinghouse colouring, as I suppose, a good deal blurred. But how I want to have it all--the gossip of the countryside--from you! Some of it has come to me as rather dreadful ... and that is what some of the lone houses in the deep valleys we motored through used to make me think of!...|$|E
