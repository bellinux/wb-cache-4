[...] Very little heat is created by the explosive decomposition of TATP; the foregoing computational analysis suggests that TATP decomposition as an entropic explosion.

They {{are also}} sensitive to substances (sulfur-containing modelling clay such as Plastilina, for example) that may prevent the silicone from curing (referred to as cure inhibition).

If making a brush-on rubber mold, the curing time factor between coats is long (longer than urethanes or polysulfides, shorter than latex).

In terms of electrochemical stability and activity, TiN {{was selected as}} the most promising candidate as a catalyst for ORR. To further enhance the activity for ORR, TiN was modified with nanostructured carbon supports including CNTs, graphene (GR), and CNT-GR hybrid. The obtained nanocarbon-supported <b>TiN</b> <b>catalysts</b> exhibited small particle sizes of TiN (< 7 nm) and a good TiN-support interaction with reduced aggregation and no free-standing TiN particles away from the supports compared to bare TiN. In particular, TiN supported on the CNT-GR hybrid (TiN/CNT-GR) showed greatly enhanced ORR activity than bare TiN and other supported <b>TiN</b> <b>catalysts.</b> It exhibited a high onset potential (0. 83 V) and the highest current density among the reported nitride-based electrocatalysts. The enhancement was ascribed to a synergistic effect between TiN nanoparticles (NPs) and CNT-GR hybird support, roles of which were to provide active sites for ORR and a facile electron pathway to NPs, respectively. Besides, TiN/CNT-GR exhibited large mesopores that could allow easy access of the electrolyte due to the formation of a 3 -D CNT-GR structure assembled between 2 -D graphene and 1 -D CNTs. Further, it showed an excellent methanol tolerance compared to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Thus, our TiN/CNT-GR could be a promising ORR electrocatalyst for PEMFCs and DMFCs. close 7...|$|R

On the other hand, in this preliminary work, a significant synergetic catalytic effect is clearly revealed in material co-doped with both titanium and tin catalysts which shows the highest reversible rates of dehydrogenation and re-hydrogenation (after their hydrogen depletion). The re-hydrogenation rates of depleted Sn/Ti/NaAlH 4 evaluated at both 9. 5 and 140 bars hydrogen are also found to be favourable compared to the Ti/NaAlH 4, which clearly suggest the importance of the catalyst choice. Basing on these results some mechanistic insights for the catalytic reversible dehydrogenation and re-hydrogenation processes of Sn/Ti/NaAlH 4 are therefore made. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Two main {{issues for}} the wide {{application}} of polymer-matrix nanocomposites need to be addressed: cost-effective processing of high-performance nanomaterials, and fundamental understanding of the nanofiller-polymer interaction related to property changes of nanocomposites. To fabricate inexpensive and robust carbon nanofibers (CNFs) by the electrospinning technique, an organosolv lignin for replacing polyacrylonitrile (PAN) precursor was investigated in this work. Modification of lignin to its butyl ester alters the electrospinnability and the thermal mobility of the lignin/PAN blend precursor fibers, which further affect the thermostabilization and carbonization processes of CNFs. The micromorphology, carbon structure, and mechanical properties of resultant CNFs were evaluated in detail. Lignin butyration reveals {{a new approach to}} controlling inter-fiber bonding of CNFs which efficiently increases the tensile strength and modulus of nonwoven mats. A commercial vapor-grown CNF reinforcing of room-temperature-vulcanized (RTV) polysiloxane foam has potential impact on the residual <b>tin</b> <b>catalyst</b> in composites and consequently the aging and the long-term performance of the materials. Elemental spectra and mapping were employed to analyze the distribution and the composition of <b>tin</b> <b>catalyst</b> residues in the CNF/polysiloxane composites. Thermal analysis revealed a significant increase of thermal stability for CNF-filled composites. Further, the glass transition properties of polysiloxane are not evidently influenced by the physical interaction between CNF filler and polysiloxane matrix. Nanocomposites consisting of anthracene, a model polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compound, and a thermosetting epoxy was matrix was studied to interpret the reinforcing effect on the glass transition temperature (Tg) by different routes: physical dispersion and/or covalent modification. The molecular dynamics of the relaxation processes were analyzed by broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS). By parametric fitting using the Havriliak-Negami (HN) function, the Arrhenius diagram was obtained to evaluate the temperature dependence of the relaxation processes at different length scales for the nanocomposites. The segmental α relaxation was strongly affected by the reinforcing approaches and the correlation of Tg-scaled fragility to molecular structures provides the explanation for the mechanisms of the nanofiller-polymer interaction. In addition, the accelerated chemical aging of nylon 6 polymer, a common material for wire insulations, was monitored by a nondestructive dielectric/capacitive method. The correlation between dielectric properties and electrical breakdown strength was found dependent on the polarity of the aircraft fluids to which nylon 6 was exposed. It was concluded that permittivity/capacitance measurement offers a feasible nondestructive method for diagnosing the breakdown strength of chemically immersed nylon 6...|$|E

Nanoparticles with extremely high thermal conductivity (Carbon Nanotubes, Graphene and Graphene Nanoplatelets, hexagonal Boron Nitride) are expected to confer a huge improvement to polymer thermal properties. Recently, Graphene Nanoplatelets (GNP) have become an interesting option due to their geometry, which allows to obtain an higher contact between nanoparticles [1, 2, 3].

40|$|Biodegradable {{aliphatic}} polycarbonates {{are important}} components of non-toxic thermoplastic elastomers, {{which have a}} variety of medical applications. Industrially, aliphatic polycarbonates derived from six-membered cyclic carbonates such as trimethylene carbonate (TMC or 1, 3 -dioxan- 2 -one) are produced via ring-opening polymerization (ROP) processes {{in the presence of a}} <b>tin</b> <b>catalyst.</b> It is worth mentioning that TMC is readily obtained by transesterification of 1, 3 -propanediol with various reagents including phosgene and its derivatives. Therefore, it has been of great interest to investigate greener routes for the production of this important class of polymers. Toward this goal, the synthesis of aliphatic polycarbonates via the metal catalyzed alternative coupling of oxetanes and carbon dioxide represents an attractive alternative. The use of an abundant, inexpensive, non-toxic, and biorenewable resource, carbon dioxide, makes this method very valuable. Furthermore, in this reaction, the sixmembered cyclic carbonate byproduct, TMC, can also be ring-opened and transformed into the same polycarbonate. For over a decade, the Darensbourg research group has successfully utilized metal salen complexes as catalysts for the epoxide/CO 2 copolymerization process. Hence, this dissertation focuses on the examination of these complexes as catalysts for the oxetane/CO 2 copolymerization reaction and the further elucidation of its mechanism. Chromium(III) salen derivatives in the presence of an azide ion initiator were determined to be very effective catalysts for the coupling of oxetanes and carbon dioxide providing polycarbonates with minimal amounts of ether linkages. Kinetic and mechanistic investigations performed on this process suggested that copolymer formation proceeded by two routes. These are the direct enchainment of oxetane and CO 2, and the intermediacy of trimethylene carbonate, which was observed as a minor product of the coupling reaction. Anion initiators which are good leaving groups, e. g. bromide and iodide, are effective at affording TMC, and hence, more polycarbonate can be formed by the ROP of preformed trimethylene carbonate. Research efforts at tuning the selectivity of the oxetane/CO 2 coupling process for TMC and/or polycarbonate produced from the homopolymerization of preformed TMC have been performed using cobalt(II) salen derivatives along with anion initiators. Lastly, investigations of this process involving 3 -methoxy-methyl- 3 -methyloxetane will be presented...|$|E

This work aims at investigating the dispersion ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of ε-caprolactone in the presence of fluoropolymer-based stabilizers, that were prepared by combining the ring opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone and atom transfer radical polymerization of heptadecafluorodecylacrylate (AC 8) and so, stabilizing PCL micrometric particles in supercritical carbon dioxide. In practice, the ROP of CL was initiated by dibutyltin dimethoxide in the presence of PCL-b-PAC 8 diblock stabilizers of differents molecular weight and composition. After 24 h at 40 °C, PCL was collected as a powder that consists of small-sized microspheres. Finally, post-polymerization purification of PCL (removal of <b>tin</b> <b>catalyst</b> that may lead to toxicological problems) was demonstrated to be quite feasible by supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) leading to the preparation of PCL with low catalytic residues. The second goal of this work aims at reporting on the use of sc CO 2 for the preparation of foams of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL), that could be useful in the packaging sector and/or the biomedical sector as potential scaffolds for tissue engineering but also as substitutes for polystyrene thermoformed trays. The method that consists of saturating a polymer with a compressed or supercritical fluid, such as carbon dioxide followed by depressurization and polymer expansion was investigated. Indeed, no residual product is left in the foam, no toxic gas is produced and no resort to hydrocarbon solvents is required. Moreover, CO 2 is cheap, non-toxic, recyclable, non-flammable and the technology of CO 2 -assisted foaming can be used in either a batch mode or in a continuous mode within a high-pressure extruder...|$|E
40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} composite tanks {{provide a}} promising {{method of storage}} for liquid oxygen and hydrogen for aerospace applications. The inherent thermal fatigue of these vessels leads {{to the formation of}} microcracks, which allow gas phase leakage across the tank walls. In this dissertation, self-healing functionality is imparted to a structural composite to effectively seal microcracks induced by both mechanical and thermal loading cycles. Two different microencapsulated healing chemistries are investigated in woven glass fiber/epoxy and uni-weave carbon fiber/epoxy composites. Self-healing of mechanically induced damage was first studied in a room temperature cured plain weave E-glass/epoxy composite with encapsulated dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) monomer and wax protected Grubbs' catalyst healing components. A controlled amount of microcracking was introduced through cyclic indentation of opposing surfaces of the composite. The resulting damage zone was proportional to the indentation load. Healing was assessed {{through the use of a}} pressure cell apparatus to detect nitrogen flow through the thickness direction of the damaged composite. Successful healing resulted in a perfect seal, with no measurable gas flow. The effect of DCPD microcapsule size (51 um and 18 um) and concentration (0 - 12. 2 wt%) on the self-sealing ability was investigated. Composite specimens with 6. 5 wt% 51 um capsules sealed 67 % of the time, compared to 13 % for the control panels without healing components. A thermally stable, dual microcapsule healing chemistry comprised of silanol terminated poly(dimethyl siloxane) plus a crosslinking agent and a <b>tin</b> <b>catalyst</b> was employed to allow higher composite processing temperatures. The microcapsules were incorporated into a satin weave E-glass fiber/epoxy composite processed at 120 C to yield a glass transition temperature of 127 C. Self-sealing ability after mechanical damage was assessed for different microcapsule sizes (25 um and 42 um) and concentrations (0 - 11 vol%). Incorporating 9 vol% 42 um capsules or 11 vol% 25 um capsules into the composite matrix leads to 100 % of the samples sealing. The effect of microcapsule concentration on the short beam strength, storage modulus, and glass transition temperature of the composite specimens was also investigated. The thermally stable tin catalyzed poly(dimethyl siloxane) healing chemistry was then integrated into a [0 / 90]s uniweave carbon fiber/epoxy composite. Thermal cycling (- 196 C to 35 C) of these specimens lead to the formation of microcracks, over time, formed a percolating crack network from one side of the composite to the other, resulting in a gas permeable specimen. Crack damage accumulation and sample permeability was monitored with number of cycles for both self-healing and traditional non-healing composites. Crack accumulation occurred at a similar rate for all sample types tested. A 63 % increase in lifetime extension was achieved for the self-healing specimens over traditional non-healing composites...|$|E
40|$|This work {{is focused}} on {{description}} of qualitative determination of residual <b>tin</b> based <b>catalysts</b> in poly(lactic acid) by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and fluorimetry as standard technique. Three types of poly(lactic acid) were prepared by direct melt polycondensation of lactic acid by using methanesulfonic acid (w = 0. 5 %) or various amount of stannous 2 -ethylhexanoate (w = (0. 5 and 2) %). The results from both methods show {{that the amount of}} observed tin in the samples correlates with the concentration of the stannous 2 -ethylhexanoate used for polycondensation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was proven to be suitable for detection of tin residuals in polymer matrix...|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} and most studied groups of biodegradable polymers are polyesters. Polyesters can be synthesized {{in a number of ways}} including direct condensation of alcohols and acids, ring opening polymerizations (ROP), and metal-catalyzed polymerization reactions. A great disadvantage of the step-wise polymerization via condensation of an acid and an alcohol is the need to continuously remove water from this system in order to drive the equilibrium of the reaction forward. [...] This can necessitate harsh reaction conditions and long reaction times, resulting in a wide dispersity. A wide variety of starting materials can be used to synthesize polyesters, and each monomer type endows the final polymer chain with different characteristics and properties. The ROP of cyclic dimeric glycolic or lactic acid forms α-hydroxy acids which then polymerize into poly-(α-esters). A variety of organometallic initiators can be used to start the polymerization of polyesters, including tin, zinc, and aluminum complexes. The most common is tin(II)octanoate and has been approved as a food additive by the U.S. FDA, but there are still concerns about using the <b>tin</b> <b>catalysts</b> in the synthesis of biodegradable polymers for biomedical uses. The synthesis of poly(β-esters) and poly(γ-esters) can be carried out by similar ROP or condensation methods as with poly(γ-esters). Development of metal-free process that involve the use of bacterial or enzymatic catalysis in polyester formation is also being explored. [...] These reactions have the benefit of generally being regioselective and stereospecific but suffer from the high cost of bacteria and enzymes, long reaction times, and products of low molecular weight.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} Rh-Sn/SiO 2 {{catalysts}} has been prepared by successive impregnation of SiO 2 sol–gel (pH 5) with precursors chlorides of rhodium(III) and tin(II). Monometallic Rh/SiO 2 and Sn/SiO 2 samples were also prepared for comparison. The solids had {{been characterized by}} transmission electronic microscopy (TEM), electron diffraction (ED), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), H 2 chemisorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. The catalytic evaluation of crotonaldehyde hydrogenation was performed in liquid phase hydrogenation at atmospheric pressure. Only {{a slight increase in}} the metal particle size and significant rhodium coverage is produced by tin as it was found by TEM and XPS. Both Rh 0 and Rhδ+ species were detected in low content of <b>tin</b> <b>catalysts,</b> whereas a high proportion of tin in an oxidized state (close to 70 %) in all the samples was found by XPS. ED studies allowed the detection of bimetallic phases, RhxSny and oxides of tin as SnO 2. An important decrease in catalytic activity is produced by addition of tin, however, at the same conversion level, a significant enhancement in the selectivity to crotyl alcohol (CROL) was observed. The results are explained on the basis of an electronic effect produced by the oxidized tin species and RhxSny intermetallic phase that allow the polarization of the carbonyl group and inhibit the hydrogenation of C=C, respectively. The presence of these new species, modifies the nature of the active sites contributing to an increase in the selectivity to CROL due to electronic effects. However, at higher Sn/Rh, the activity drops significantly due to a decrease in the hydrogenation capacity and also due to the creation of surface acid sites, an important amount of byproducts, such as acetals and esters are obtained. ...|$|R
