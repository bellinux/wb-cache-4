Both the East Pacific Rise and Kyushu-Palau Ridge samples showed Ne excess relative to Ar and a monotonic decrease from Xe to Ar {{when compared with}} <b>air</b> noble <b>gas</b> abundance. This characteristic noble gas abundance pattern (type 2, classified by Ozima and Alexander) is interpreted {{to be due to}} a two-stage degassing from a noble gas reservoir with originally atmospheric abundance. In the Kyushu-Palau Ridge sample, noble gases are nearly ten times more abundant than in the East Pacific Rise samples. This may be attributed to an oceanic crust contamination in the former mantle source. There is no correlation between the He content and that of the other noble gas in the CYAMEX samples. This suggests that He was derived from a larger region, independent from the other noble gases. Except where radiogenic isotopes are involved, all other noble <b>gas</b> isotopic <b>ratios</b> were indistinguishable from <b>air</b> noble <b>gas</b> isotopic <b>ratios.</b> The 3 He/ 4 He in the East Pacific Rise shows a remarkably uniform ratio of (1. 21 +/- 0. 07) * 10 **- 5, while the 40 Ar/ 36 Ar ranges from 700 to 5600...|$|R

In the present work, a transversal granular flow model and two numerical models for {{the description of the}} granular bed of a rotary kiln are developed for the analysis of a Calcium Aluminate rotary kiln from an industrial partner. From the transversal granular flow model it is concluded that the kiln from the industrial partner is probably not in rolling mode. This hints the possibility that there is a non-optimized mixing in the kiln which could bring adverse consequences in the production and current modelling of the studied rotary kiln. A validated one-dimensional rotary kiln model is developed taking into account different approaches from literature. Simplified sintering reactions are proposed by considering experimental X-Ray Diffraction data. The one-dimensional model is successfully used to describe the properties of the product when changing <b>air</b> to <b>gas</b> <b>ratio</b> of the combustion gasses in the kiln from the industrial partner. Furthermore, a two-dimensional transversal model for granular bed heat transfer is developed to explore whether a full granular flow model is necessary {{in order to have a}} sufficiently accurate description of the granular material properties of the kiln from the industrial partner. It is concluded that due to the low loading of the analyzed CAC kiln, a one-dimensional is sufficient to make a sensitivity analysis on the operating conditions and design varaibles of the kiln if the bed has a rolling mode with an active layer of 5 to 20 percent of the bed height. Further research must be done in order to characterize the transversal flow of the analyzed kiln in order to develop more complex kiln models.

40|$|ABSTRACT When {{the coal}} mine fire occurs, {{it is crucial}} to judge the fire {{combustion}} state by analyzing indicator gases concentration and changing trends of various <b>gas</b> <b>ratios</b> in order to formulate proper rescue measures. It's an effective methodology to estimate the changes of combustion state in coal mine fire accurately by the trends analysis of indicator <b>gases</b> and <b>gas</b> <b>ratios</b> independent of the external environment disturbs, such as air leakage and inner gases injection. However, there are few experimental researches about the changing rules of indicator <b>gases</b> and <b>gas</b> <b>ratios</b> at different combustion phases at present. Therefore, this paper has established a small-sized coal combustion experimental platform in confined space, on which the experimental studies on variation trends about indicator <b>gases</b> and <b>gas</b> <b>ratios</b> of the whole combustion phases are conducted.

Extremely high quality graphene growth is possible at high temperatures using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Use of an inductively coupled plasma chemical vapor deposition (ICP CVD) reactor {{with the benefit of}} precursor gas decomposition through plasma generation, may provide possibility to reduce growth temperature. Herein, we report plasma’s effects on graphene growth by comparing growths of increasing power supplied to plasma generation and changes in precursor <b>gas</b> <b>ratios.</b> Plasma composition was characterized by ultraviolet and visible light spectroscopy; graphene was characterized by Raman spectroscopy. Plasma was observed to change gradually and in a threshold shift. Gradual changes in plasma resulted in changes in graphene quality, both defect density and number of layers. The shift produced sudden changes in graphene quality. Further, increasing power before and after the shift produced opposite correlated trends. Finally, reduced hydrogen to acetylene <b>gas</b> <b>ratios</b> produced plasma associated with higher powers at a higher <b>gas</b> <b>ratio.</b> Though the comparative plasma spectra between the two reduced <b>gas</b> <b>ratio</b> growths were very similar, the quality of graphene was different.

50|$|Streaming instabilities {{form when}} the solid {{particles}} are moderately coupled to the gas, with Stokes numbers of 0.01 - 3; the local solid to <b>gas</b> <b>ratio</b> is near or larger than 1; and the vertically integrated solid to <b>gas</b> <b>ratio</b> {{is a few}} times Solar. The Stokes number {{is a measure of}} the relative influences of inertia and gas drag on a particle's motion. In this context it is the product of the timescale for the exponential decay of a particle's velocity due to drag and the angular frequency of its orbit. Small particles like dust are strongly coupled and move with the gas, large bodies such as planetesimals are weakly coupled and orbit largely unaffected by the gas. Moderately coupled solids, sometimes referred to as pebbles, range from roughly cm- to m-sized at asteroid belt distances and from mm- to dm-sized beyond 10 AU. These objects orbit through the gas like planetesimals but are slowed due to the headwind and undergo significant radial drift. The moderately coupled solids that participate in streaming instabilities are those dynamically affected by changes in the motions of gas on scales similar to those of the Coriolis effect, allowing them to be captured by regions of high pressure in a rotating disk. Moderately coupled solids also retain influence on the motion of the gas. If the local solid to <b>gas</b> <b>ratio</b> is near or above 1, this influence is strong enough to reinforce regions of high pressure and to increase the orbital velocity of the gas and slow radial drift. Reaching and maintaining this local solid to gas at the mid-plane requires an average solid to <b>gas</b> <b>ratio</b> in a vertical cross section of the disk that is a few times solar. When the average solid to <b>gas</b> <b>ratio</b> is 0.01, roughly that estimated from measurements of the current Solar System, turbulence at the mid-plane generates a wavelike pattern that puffs up the mid-plane layer of solids. This reduces the solid to <b>gas</b> <b>ratio</b> at the mid-plane to less than 1, suppressing the formation of dense clumps. At higher average solid to <b>gas</b> <b>ratios</b> the mass of solids dampens this turbulence allowing a thin mid-plane layer to form. Stars with higher metallicities are more likely to reach the minimum solid to <b>gas</b> <b>ratio</b> making them favorable locations for planetesimal and planet formation.|$|R

40|$|Moisture content (MC) {{of green}} biomass or raw biomass {{materials}} (wood, bark, plants, etc.) commonly exceeds 50 mass % (wet basis). The maximum possible MC of biomass fuel for big scale combustion (e. g. fluidized bed combustion with low external heat losses) is approximately 60 ¿ 65 mass %. Higher biomass MC generally causes operational problems of biomass combustors, lower stability of burning and higher CO and VOC emissions. Gasification of biomass with higher MC produces fuel gas of lower effective heating values and higher tar concentrations. In this review, various technological schemes for wood drying {{in combination with}} combustion/gasification with the assessment of factors for possible minimization of emissions of organics from the drying processes are compared. The simple direct flue gas biomass drying technologies lead to exhaust drying gases containing high VOC emissions (terpenes, alcohols, organic acids, etc.). VOC emissions depend on the drying temperature, residence time and final MC of the dried biomass. Indirect biomass drying has an advantage {{in the possibility of}} reaching very low emissions of organic compounds from the drying process. Exhaust drying gases can be simply destroyed {{as a part of the}} <b>total</b> combustion <b>air</b> (<b>gas)</b> in a combustion chamber or a gasifier. Liquid, condensed effluents have to be treated properly because they have relatively high content of organic compounds, some of them accompanied by odor. Drying of biomass with superheated steam offers more uniform drying of both small and bigger particles and shorter periods of higher temperatures of the dried biomass, particularly if drying to the final MC below 15 mass % is required. In practical modern drying technologies, biomass (mainly wood) is dried in recirculated gas of relatively high humidity (approaching saturation) and the period of constant rate drying is longer. Drying of moist wood material (saw dust, chips, etc.) is required in wood pellet production. Emissions of organics in drying depend on biomass properties, content of resins, storing time and on operational aspects of the drying process: drying temperature, drying medium, final MC, residence time, and particle size distribution of the dried biomass (wood). Integration of biomass drying with combustion/gasification processes includes the choice of the drying medium (flue <b>gas,</b> <b>air,</b> superheated steam). Properties of the drying media and operational parameters are strongly dependent on local conditions, fuel input of the combustion/gasification unit, cleaning of the exhaust drying media (gas, steam, wastewater), and on environmental factors and requirements.

It was verified that the configuration of SnO 2 :F front TCO and ZnO:B BR shows better optical properties than typical configurations for light trapping due to its high transparency at the front and high haze at the back. In addition, we noticed that the absorption of the BR has a strong influence on the solar modules. We obtained a superior ZnO:B BR with high haze and low absorption by controlling the doping <b>gas</b> <b>ratio</b> (B 2 H 6 /DEZ). As the doping <b>gas</b> <b>ratio</b> of ZnO:B BR decreases, the haze increases due to a rougher surface morphology, and the absorption decreases due to reduced free carrier absorption. The solar modules with a ZnO:B BR in a lower doping <b>gas</b> <b>ratio</b> show relatively higher Pmax for the same i-μc-Si layer thickness. This results from an increased Isc due to higher haze and lower absorption. In addition, the ZnO:B BR with a low doping <b>gas</b> <b>ratio</b> was found to be effective in reducing the i-μc-Si layer thickness because there are more chances for trapping the light at the i-μc-Si layer.
