40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{establish}} some results for <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> convex comparisons of generalized order statistics. First, we prove {{that if the}} minimum of two sets of generalized order statistics are ordered in <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> convex order, then the remaining generalized order statistics are also ordered in <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> convex order. This result is extended to <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> directionally convex comparisons of random vectors of generalized order statistics. For establishing this general result, we first prove a new result in that two random vectors with a common conditionally increasing copula are ordered in <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> directionally convex order if the marginals are ordered in <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> convex order. This latter result is, of course, of interest in its own right...|$|R

5|$|The {{macroscopic}} {{physical properties}} of the noble gases are dominated by the weak van der Waals forces between the atoms. The attractive force increases {{with the size of}} the atom as a result of <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in polarizability and the decrease in ionization potential. This results in systematic group trends: as one goes down group18, the atomic radius, and with it the interatomic forces, increases, resulting in an increasing melting point, boiling point, enthalpy of vaporization, and solubility. <b>The</b> <b>increase</b> in density is due to <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in atomic mass.|$|E
