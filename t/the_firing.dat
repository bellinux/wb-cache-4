5|$|Advancements in {{microscopic}} stamping {{have led}} to a push for the inclusion of firing pin microstamping. The microstamp is etched onto <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> pin and is transferred to the cartridge during <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> process. Each firing pin would have a unique serial number allowing investigators to trace casings found at a crime scene to a known firearm. The practice is not in use , although California has enacted legislation that requires microstamping on all newly sold firearms. The law, and microstamping in general, has received significant opposition from gun manufacturers due to increased costs associated with introducing the microstamps into the manufacturing lines.|$|E

5|$|Spent {{cartridges}} {{found at}} a scene can be examined for physical evidence such as fingerprints or compared to samples that match them to a weapon. The examination of the cartridge relies on the unique tool marks left by the {{various parts of the}} weapon including <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> pin and the ejector in semi and fully automatic firearms. These markings can be compared and matched to known exemplars fired from the same weapon using the same parts. The examination of the marks left on the cartridge is done using a comparison microscope. Examiners view the questioned cartridge and the known exemplar simultaneously, looking for similar microscopic marks left during <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> process.|$|E

50|$|On June 26, 2012, Colorado Springs {{experienced}} {{a record high}} temperature of , which aided <b>the</b> <b>fire's</b> rapid expansion through Queen's Canyon and creating significant smoke. <b>The</b> <b>fire</b> crested Queen's Canyon and winds from the west nearing 65 mph gusts (the cyclonic winds of the collapsing pyrocumulus cloud from <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> storm) pushed <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> down <b>the</b> slope and into the Mountain Shadows, Oak Valley Ranch, and Peregrine neighborhoods. <b>The</b> <b>fire</b> moved about 2 miles per hour towards the city.

50|$|Wind {{speed and}} land slope, like a {{mountain}} where <b>the</b> Beaver Creek <b>Fire</b> took place, influences <b>fire</b> behavior, specifically <b>the</b> spread of <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> Wind makes fire grow faster. As wind speed increase, {{the spread of}} <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> increases more quickly and can help increase the intensity of <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> Fire can even create some of its own wind to disperse the heat downward {{from the heart of}} the flame to the unburnt fuel ahead of <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> which helps in the rate of spread of <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> and increases <b>the</b> longevity of <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> Some argue that the increase in the spread rate of <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> from <b>the</b> windy conditions {{has to do with the}} increased oxygen supply in <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> Others argue that this is not true because of <b>the</b> fact that <b>fires</b> need a sufficient amount of oxygen to even start. Without wind, it is easier to stop a <b>fire</b> due to <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> not being pushed forward. Slope of land increases <b>the</b> spread of <b>fire</b> only and not the intensity. The reason for this is gravity pushes <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> down so that the area in front of <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> is heated up quicker and able to burn faster allowing <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> to burn more area in a period of time up a slope, even without wind, than just on flat ground.|$|R
