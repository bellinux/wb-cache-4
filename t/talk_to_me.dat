500|$|In a 2007 {{feature for}} The Guardians G2 supplement, screenwriter Danny Brocklehurst {{discussed}} the impact the series {{has had on}} British television, including inspiration {{for one of his}} programmes, <b>Talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me.</b> He opined that until Cold Feet there had not been a significant television series depicting [...] "the wants and needs of ordinary young adults" [...] since Thirtysomething concluded in 1991. Brocklehurst developed <b>Talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me</b> {{in the same manner as}} Bullen developed Cold Feet, namely by basing its characters on his own experiences and friends. Both Brocklehurst and Mark Lawson have discussed similar [...] "copycat" [...] series, including Hearts and Bones, Metropolis, Couples and Wonderful You. Brocklehurst noted that these series [...] "lacked [...] warmth and believability" [...] adding that they were [...] "unrealistic and cynical".|$|E
500|$|Lee Valmassy as L Dubba E, {{the leader}} of the 245, a rival gang to the 248. Jason Trost said the {{character}} is similar to Mr. T and that Valmassy was [...] "so embarrassed...when he first [...] he almost didn't want to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> again". Valmassy also appears several times as a background extra.|$|E

Orr's tenure ran from 1980 to 1994.|$|E
500|$|In 2014 Smith {{offered her}} {{opinion on the}} sexualization of women in music. [...] "Pop music has always been about the {{mainstream}} and what appeals to the public. I don't feel it's my place to judge." [...] As at points earlier in her life and career, she declined to embrace politicized feminism: [...] "I have {{a son and a}} daughter, people always <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> about feminism and women's rights, but I have a son too—I believe in human rights." ...|$|E

This {{was part of the}} Dove Hair's [...] "Real Beauty" [...] challenge which required her to use Dove's new moisturizing shampoos, conditioners and treatments. She also states that she refuses to conform to the idea of the perfect Hollywood body. In an interview with Allure, Larter revealed she once was asked by producers, by faxes sent out to her agent and manager, to lose weight. [...] "I just remember sitting in my trailer hysterically crying from the embarrassment I felt about myself, my body – and that no one could <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> directly." ...|$|E

500|$|Leaf related poorly to {{both the}} media and his teammates, whom he tended to blame for his poor play. In a locker-room {{incident}} during Leaf's rookie year, he was caught on camera screaming [...] "Don't <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> alright? KNOCK IT OFF!" [...] to San Diego Union Tribune reporter Jay Posner, and was physically restrained by Junior Seau. He soon developed a reputation for a poor work ethic {{to the point of}} occasionally being found on the golf course while the other quarterbacks were studying film. After Leaf's rookie season ended, Charger safety Rodney Harrison described it as [...] "a nightmare you can't even imagine," [...] adding: [...] "If I had to go through another year like that, I'd probably quit playing." ...|$|E
500|$|Friends {{encouraged}} Crittenden to run {{for president}} in the 1848 election. A Nashville newspaper declared its support for him as early as 1846. A Democratic senator from Rhode Island opined that Crittenden could win support from a sizable number of Democrats in addition to the support of his own party. George B. Kinkead desired to have the Kentucky General Assembly nominate Crittenden for president in 1847. None of these overtures swayed Crittenden. [...] "For Heaven's sake don't <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> about the Presidency," [...] he said, rebuffing one early offer. Clay hoped Crittenden would again support him, but Crittenden concluded that Clay was no longer a viable candidate and threw his support behind Kentuckian Zachary Taylor. This decision caused a rift between the two friends, and they were not reconciled until years later when Clay lay on his deathbed.|$|E
500|$|The city of Paterson, New Jersey, {{renamed the}} Eastside Park {{baseball}} field [...] "Larry Doby Field" [...] on June 1, 2002.

Of Berra, Doby said, [...] "Yogi {{was one of}} the first opposing players to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> As a catcher, Yogi talked to everybody. I finally had to tell the umpire: 'Please tell him to shut up. He asked me how my family was back in the first inning.'" [...] In 2011, the U.S. Postal Service announced that Doby would be one of the four baseball players (along with Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio, and Willie Stargell) to appear on a postage stamp in 2012, as part of its [...] "Major League Baseball All-Stars" [...] series.

500|$|Shahid Kapoor {{was born}} in New Delhi on 25 February 1981 to actor Pankaj Kapur and actor-dancer Neelima Azeem. His parents {{divorced}} when he was three years old; his father shifted to Mumbai (and married the actress Supriya Pathak) and Kapoor continued living in Delhi {{with his mother and}} maternal grandparents. His grandparents were journalists for the Russian magazine Sputnik, and Kapoor was particularly fond of his grandfather: [...] "He would walk me to school every single day. He would <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> about dad, with whom he shared a great relationship, and read out his letters to me." [...] His father, who was then a struggling actor in Mumbai, would visit Kapoor only once a year on his birthday. When Kapoor was 10, his mother, who was working as a dancer, moved to Mumbai to work as an actress.|$|E
500|$|Hannah Levin of the Seattle {{publication}} The Stranger {{analyzed the}} lyrics to the track [...] "Mrs. Jones", calling it a [...] "particularly rattling sketch of {{what appears to be}} a rape scene, with Love seamlessly handling three perspectives: the ugly attacker ("Look into the bloodrot, you suicide bitch / It takes an hour with you to make me want to live"), the vengeful victim ("The abortion left an abscess / Don't ever <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like that again"), and the supportive narrator ("Just like a pro, she takes off her dress / And she kicks you down in her snow white pumps")." [...] The song also makes direct references to The Ballad of East and West, a poem by Rudyard Kipling, with the line: [...] "East is east and west is west, and mine was you and mine was best", which is a partial quote from the poem.|$|E
500|$|Early {{versions}} {{opened with}} the line [...] "Don't <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> about {{the rights of the}} IRA, UDA." [...] U2's bassist, Adam Clayton, recalls that better judgment led to the removal of such a politically charged line, and that the song's [...] "viewpoint became very humane and non-sectarian...which, is the only responsible position." [...] The chosen opening line, [...] "I can't believe the news today" [...] crystallises the prevailing response, especially among young people, to the violence in Northern Ireland during the 1970s and 1980s. In successive stanzas, the lyrics paraphrase religious text from Matthew [...] ("mother's children; brothers, sisters torn apart") and bring a twist to 1 Corinthians [...] ("we eat and drink while tomorrow they die", instead of [...] "let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we die"). [...] The song finishes with a call for the Irish to stop fighting each other, and [...] "claim the victory Jesus won...on [...] Sunday bloody Sunday." ...|$|E

500|$|On 8 June 2008, {{news reports}} {{indicated}} that Pratchett had an experience {{which he described}} as: [...] "It is just possible that once you have got past all the gods that we have created with big beards and many human traits, just beyond all that, {{on the other side}} of physics, there just may be the ordered structure from which everything flows" [...] and [...] "I don't actually believe in anyone who could have put that in my head". He went into further detail on Front Row, in which he was asked if this was a shift in his beliefs: [...] "A shift in me in the sense I heard my father <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> when I was in the garden one day. But I'm absolutely certain that what I heard was my memories of my father. An engram, or something in my head...This is not about God, but somewhere around there is where gods come from." ...|$|E
500|$|On November 20, 2016, soon before {{abruptly}} {{ending a}} concert prematurely he said, [...] "Jay Z—call me, bruh. You still ain't called me. Jay-Z, I know you got killers. Please don't send them at my head. Please call me. <b>Talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like a man." [...] The following day, he {{was committed to}} the UCLA Medical Center with hallucinations and paranoia. Contrary to what early reports said, however, West was not actually {{taken to the hospital}} involuntarily; he was persuaded to do so by authorities. While the episode was first described as one of [...] "temporary psychosis" [...] caused by dehydration and sleep deprivation, West's mental state was abnormal enough for his 21 cancelled concerts to be covered by his insurance policy; he was reportedly paranoid and depressed throughout the hospitalization, but remains formally undiagnosed. The Paris robbery of his wife may have triggered the paranoia. On November 30, West was released from the hospital.|$|E
500|$|During {{the offseason}} {{preceding}} the 2015 season, De Fratus {{became involved in}} some controversy involving Phillies blogger Bill Baer and the Black Lives Matter campaign when he tweeted, [...] "I'm sick of this black vs white and men vs women garbage that's been going on. We're just people. #AllLivesMatter," [...] to which Baer responded with a scathing column on Crashburn Alley, a blog affiliated with ESPN, in which he stated that De Fratus is [...] "complicit in perpetuating a system which inflicts violence on those who didn’t {{have the luxury of}} being born white and male and straight and in an economically-stable area." [...] Subsequently, De Fratus penned a retort to Baer via Facebook, in which he commented, [...] "I sincerely hope that you will take the time to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> personally next time before you decide to hide behind your computer screen and criticize me, my upbringing and my character based on 140 characters. I do not apologize for anything I have said. I have a platform and I WILL use it for the agenda of love." ...|$|E

500|$|A player's {{baseball}} statistics {{can increase}} or reduce the leverage which {{he may have}} in future contract negotiations. Many players also have monetary incentives written in their contracts {{which are based on}} statistical measurements, and official scorers have the option to reverse a scoring decision within 24 hours of the conclusion of a game. Because of this, baseball writer-scorers were often subject to pressure from the players they were covering in their newspaper. After a game in 1962, infielder Jerry Adair asked for a meeting with local writer Neal Eskridge after learning that he was the scorer for the game. Angry about an error he had received in the game, Jerry [...] "cursed [...] thoroughly and imaginatively, and told him, 'Never <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> again. They reportedly did not speak to each other for almost four years. In the early days of baseball, a disagreement over a scoring decision occasionally led to physical altercations between the player and the writer. Confrontational incidents decreased after 1974 following a warning from MLB.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Hawke {{entered the}} horror genre {{for the first}} time, by playing a true crime writer in Scott Derrickson's Sinister, which grossed US$87million at the {{worldwide}} box office—the film {{was the first in}} a series of highly profitable films for Hawke after the start of the new decade. In the week prior to the US opening of Sinister, Hawke explained that he was previously turned off by horror because good acting is not always required for success; however, the producer of Sinister, Jason Blum, who formerly ran a theater company with Hawke, made the offer to the actor based on the character and director."when I was younger, I ran a theater company with this guy, Jason Blum. And he loved horror movies and he went on to create his own little subgenre with [...] "Paranormal Activity." [...] And he kept trying to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> about how I should love this whole genre. And I told him: I've never had a script with a really great character and a real filmmaker attached to it that I'd be interested in. So, he brought me into it.|$|E
500|$|... "Stupid in Love" [...] is a R power ballad which {{lasts for}} 4:01 (four minutes, one second). Instrumentation is {{provided}} by finger snapping, minor piano keys and piano riffs, a style of repeated chord progression. The lyrics of [...] "Stupid in Love" [...] revolve around a woman in an abusive and adulterous relationship, progressing to the female protagonist leaving her boyfriend. The song begins with the line [...] "Let me tell you somethin' / Never / Have I ever / Been a size 10 in my whole life." [...] Rihanna sings the line [...] "This is stupid / I'm not stupid / Don't <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> / Like I'm stupid" [...] during the chorus. The bridge consists of Rihanna singing [...] "Trying {{to make this work}} / but you act like a jerk." [...] As noted by Rob Harvilla of The Village Voice, the bridge represents the moment when Rihanna realizes that it is not worth her while to stay in the relationship, writing [...] "the dunce cap is off". [...] "Stupid in Love" [...] contains a lyrical metaphor, [...] "Blood on your hands." ...|$|E
