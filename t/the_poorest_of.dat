5|$|The Marshalsea (1373–1842) was {{a notorious}} prison in Southwark (now London), {{just south of}} the River Thames. Although it housed a variety of prisoners, {{including}} men accused of crimes at sea and political figures charged with sedition, it became known, in particular, for its incarceration of <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> London's debtors. Over half the population of England's prisons in the 18th century were in jail because of debt.|$|E

The province is bordered along the Luapula River, through Lake Mweru and to its north by DR Congo. Around 80.5 per cent {{of the population of}} Luapula is accounted as poor in 2010 census, making it <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> all provinces in Zambia. It has eight major attractions of the country among its waterfalls, wildlife and cultural heritage.

5|$|It targets <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> the poor, with a {{particular}} emphasis on women, who receive 95 percent of the bank's loans. Women traditionally had less access to financial alternatives of ordinary credit lines and incomes. They were seen to have an inequitable share of power in household decision making. Yunus and others have found that lending to women generates considerable secondary effects, including empowerment of a marginalised segment of society (Yunus and Jolis 1998), who share betterment of income with their children, unlike many men. Yunus claims that in 2004, women still have difficulty getting loans; they comprise less than 1 percent of borrowers from commercial banks (Yunus 2004). The interest rates charged by microfinance institutes including Grameen Bank is high {{compared to that of}} traditional banks; Grameen's interest (reducing balance basis) on its main credit product is about 20%.|$|E
5|$|The equestrians, {{the highest}} social class of all, served in mounted units known as equites. The first {{class of the}} richest {{citizens}} served as heavy infantry with swords and long spears (resembling hoplites), and provided {{the first line of}} the battle formation. The second class were armed similarly to the first class, but without a breastplate for protection, and with an oblong rather than a round shield. The second class stood immediately behind the first class when the army was drawn up in battle formation. The third and fourth classes were more lightly armed and carried a thrusting-spear and javelins. The third class stood behind the second class in battle formation, normally providing javelin support. <b>The</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> the propertied men of the city comprised the fifth class. They were generally too poor to afford much equipment at all and were armed as skirmishers with slings and stones. They were deployed in a screen in front of the main army, covering its approach and masking its manoeuvres.|$|E
5|$|When Chamorro {{was sworn}} into office on 25 April 1990, {{it was the}} first time in more than five decades that a {{peaceful}} transition of power had occurred in Nicaragua and the first time that one elected president had given way to another. She inherited a hyperinflated, war-torn economy, but she was able to end the war and establish a lasting peace. Chamorro's leadership covered six difficult years marked by economic strife and social unrest, but she was able to compromise with rivals, maintain a constitutional regime, re-establish international banking relationships and end the hyperinflation that had plagued the country for several years. The years of Violeta Chamorro initiate a period of significant economic and social decline for Nicaragua. From 1990 to 2001, the country fell from 60th to 116th in the world in terms of human development, and has become <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> America after Haiti, according to United Nations Development Programme. After leaving office on 10 January 1997, Chamorro worked on several international peace initiatives until poor health forced her to retire from public life.|$|E

5|$|The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) were {{established}} by delegates at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944 and became operational in 1946. The IBRD was established {{with the original}} mission of financing the reconstruction efforts of war-torn European nations following World War II, with goals shared by the later Marshall Plan. The Bank issued its inaugural loan of $250 million ($2.6 billion in 2012 dollars) to France in 1947 to finance infrastructure projects. The institution also established its first field offices in Paris, France, Copenhagen, Denmark, and Prague in the former Czechoslovakia. Throughout {{the remainder of the}} 1940s and 1950s, the Bank financed projects seeking to dam rivers, generate electricity, and improve access to water and sanitation. It also invested in France, Belgium, and Luxembourg's steel industry. Following the reconstruction of Europe, the Bank's mandate has transitioned to eradicating poverty around the world. In 1960, the International Development Association (IDA) was established to serve as the Bank's concessional lending arm and provide low and no-cost finance and grants to <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> the developing countries as measured by gross national income per capita.|$|E

25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of migration from Ireland is recorded since early Medieval times, {{but it is}} only possible to quantify it from around 1700: since then between 9 and 10 million people born in Ireland have emigrated. This is more than the population of Ireland at its historical peak in the 1840s of 8.5 million. <b>The</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> them went to Great Britain, especially Liverpool; those who could afford it went further, including almost 5 million to the United States.|$|E

25|$|Those in the {{business}} have considered domesticating the mopane worms {{in a manner that}} is similar to the domestication of silkworms.

For a domesticated industry to succeed on a small scale and be accessible to <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> the poor, the cost of production would have to be comparable with the cost of wild worms or dried worms at the market.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, the North American Jurassic {{record is}} <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> the Mesozoic, with few {{outcrops}} at the surface. Though the epicontinental Sundance Sea left marine deposits {{in parts of}} the northern plains of the United States and Canada during the late Jurassic, most exposed sediments from this period are continental, such as the alluvial deposits of the Morrison Formation. The first of several massive batholiths were emplaced in the northern Cordillera beginning in the mid-Jurassic, marking the Nevadan orogeny. Important Jurassic exposures are also found in Russia, India, South America, Japan, Australasia and the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Because of this, after World War II ended, {{workers from}} the British Commonwealth were {{encouraged}} to migrate to Oldham, amongst other similarly industrialised English towns, to fill the shortfall of indigenous employees, and thus benefit from increased economic opportunity; albeit from tough unsociable employment regimes in a distinctly foreign land. These migrant groups, initially male Caribbeans and Pakistanis, but later Bangladeshi (then East Pakistani), Indian, Caribbean, and Pakistani families began to arrive in considerable numbers in the 1960s, settling throughout the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham. However, due to the comparatively poor circumstances with which they arrived in Britain, these migrants settled in concentrated neighborhoods, inhabiting <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> Oldham's then crumbling Victorian residential areas - most of which have since been redeveloped.|$|E
25|$|While {{growing up}} in Puerto Rico in the 1950s and 1960s, La Luz’s {{grandfather}} used {{to take him to}} the tobacco, coffee and sugarcane fields in Puerto Rico where he witnessed first hand the plight of poor Puerto Ricans who were toiling these fields to earn their meager livelihoods. Having seen the swollen bellies of their children who were malnourished and whose fathers pushed relentlessly to work the fields while living in <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> conditions – many in shacks without running water, electricity and with poor hygienic conditions – La Luz began to understand the importance of working for the sensible human rights of those who had no voice. The fight for basic rights and justice for all people, no matter who they were or where they were from became his life’s passion.|$|E
5000|$|At {{about this}} time, Waldo began to preach and teach publicly, {{based on his}} ideas of {{simplicity}} and poverty, notably that [...] "No man can serve two masters, God and Mammon." [...] Waldo condemned what he considered as papal excesses and Catholic dogmas, including purgatory and transubstantiation. He said that these dogmas were [...] "the harlot" [...] {{from the book of}} Revelation. By 1170 Waldo had gathered a large number of followers, referred to as <b>the</b> <b>Poor</b> <b>of</b> Lyons, <b>the</b> <b>Poor</b> <b>of</b> Lombardy, or <b>the</b> <b>Poor</b> <b>of</b> God.

25|$|Economic {{development}} did {{not bring}} prosperity to all. During the 1960s many of the rural poor felt increasingly dissatisfied with their condition in society and disillusioned by their treatment by the central government in Bangkok. Efforts by the Thai government to develop poor rural regions often {{did not have the}} desired effect in that they contributed to the farmers' awareness of how bad off they really were. It {{is interesting to note that}} it was not always <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> the poor who joined the anti-government insurgency. Increased government presence in the rural villages did little to improve the situation. Villagers became subject to increased military and police harassment and bureaucratic corruption. Villagers often felt betrayed when government promises of development were frequently not fulfilled. By the early 1970s rural discontent had manifested itself into a peasant's activist movement.|$|E
