5|$|Both {{resident}} and transient orangutans aggregate on large fruiting <b>trees</b> <b>to</b> feed. The fruits {{tend to be}} abundant, so competition is low and individuals may engage in social interactions. Orangutans will also form travelling groups with members moving between different food sources. These groups tend {{to be made of}} only a few individuals. They also tend to be consortships between an adult male and female.|$|E
5|$|Dennis lightly {{affected}} Mississippi, dropping between 1–5inches (25–125mm) {{of rainfall}} and producing wind gusts up to , causing several hundred <b>trees</b> <b>to</b> uproot or snap and damaging {{a total of}} 21homes and businesses. Over 40structures were flooded, forcing 200people to leave their homes. One indirect death occurred from a traffic accident in Jasper County due to wet roads. During {{the height of the}} storm, 24,000customers were without power. In all, Hurricane Dennis caused $2.4million (2005USD) in damage across the state.|$|E

5|$|It was {{discovered}} later that Kehoe had cut all his wire fences {{as part of}} his preparations to destroy his farm, girdling young shade <b>trees</b> <b>to</b> kill them and cutting off his grapevine plants before putting them back on their stumps to hide the damage.

5|$|Loggers felled {{massive amounts}} of forest in the 1920s and 1930s. Reforestation efforts began in the 1940s because natural {{regeneration}} could not {{keep pace with the}} rate of logging. In 1962, the Columbus Day Storm knocked many more large <b>trees</b> <b>to</b> the ground. Today, old-growth forest covers only about five percent of the watershed.|$|E

5|$|Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) and the Sacramento Tree Foundation have partnered {{to provide}} the city of Sacramento shade trees for free. The program allows {{citizens}} to receive trees from four to seven feet tall. They also give them fertilizer, and delivery, all at no cost. They encourage citizens to plant their <b>trees</b> <b>to</b> benefit their home by reducing air conditioning costs. Approximately more than 450,000 shade trees have been planted in the Sacramento area.|$|E
5|$|Sam Brown and W. D. Hamilton and Marco Archetti {{proposed}} that autumn leaf colour is {{a signal from}} <b>trees</b> <b>to</b> aphids and other pest species that migrate in autumn to the trees. In their theory, bright autumn coloration with pinks and yellows is costly to trees because pigments require energy to synthesize, but the investment may help them to reduce their parasite load.|$|E
5|$|The city of Visalia, California has {{implemented}} a street tree ordinance intended {{to promote and}} regulate the planting, maintenance, and protection of street trees within the city.

5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture roosts on high, exposed dead <b>trees</b> <b>to</b> observe {{surrounding}} terrain. When flying, {{it travels}} in pairs or alone and is rarely found in groups. Flight is heavy and steady. It flies with its wings held flat or very slightly above horizontal, {{in what is}} called the dihedral position. The flight of the greater yellow-headed is an example of static soaring flight, which uses thermals to maintain altitude without the need to flap its wings.|$|E

5|$|A {{hallmark}} of the curriculum in the earliest days was study organized around major themes—trees, Shakespeare, Egypt and other subjects—that built over the school year into major class projects, performances, and all-school gatherings. Many of these themes and events have grown into lasting school traditions, with which the school community has come to identify each group and certain times of year. One the school's most cherished traditions, tapping maple <b>trees</b> <b>to</b> make syrup, began with the move to the new building in 1929. The Spring Fair, in which groups one through five each prepare and perform their own dance, has been held annually since the 1930s—the Maypole dance by the fifth group {{dates back to the}} beginning of the Cottage School.|$|E
5|$|Arguments soon {{broke out}} between the Crown and the {{corporation}} over the deal. The Crown argued that the corporation was not adequately maintaining the castle and blockhouses. The Earl of Sussex complained in 1569 {{that they were in}} need of repair, and a 1576 survey stated that their gun platforms were in poor condition and that the ditches had become clogged with earth, while coastal erosion had undermined the South Blockhouse. Queen Elizabeth I provided 300 <b>trees</b> <b>to</b> help the repair work and a new jetty was built to protect {{the southern end of the}} defences from the sea. The Crown gave 60 <b>trees</b> <b>to</b> the town to help with further repairs in 1581. Fears of a Spanish invasion resulted in fresh repairs being carried out, and the threat of the Armada in 1588 resulted in proposals to build additional earthworks around the blockhouses, but nothing appear to have actually been carried out. The dispute over maintenance between the Crown and the town finally came to court in 1588; the corporation argued that green timber had been used in the original construction work and claimed that they had spent £2,893 between 1552 and 1587 on the defences: the Crown's case failed.|$|E
5|$|Armillaria luteobubalina {{was first}} {{described}} in 1978, {{after having been}} discovered several years earlier growing in a Eucalyptus plantation in southeastern Australia. It distinguished itself from other known Australian Armillaria species by its aggressive pathogenicity. It may take years for infected <b>trees</b> <b>to</b> show signs of disease, leading to an underestimation of disease prevalence. Studies show that the spread of disease in eucalypt forests is associated with infected stumps left following logging operations. Although several methods have been suggested to control the spread of disease, they are largely economically or environmentally unfeasible. Phylogenetic analyses have determined that A.luteobubalina {{is closely related to}} A.montagnei and that both of these species are in turn closely related to the Brazilian species A.paulensis. The distribution of A.luteobubalina suggests that it is an ancient species that originated before the separation of the precursor supercontinent Gondwana.|$|E

5|$|Carrion, fungi, fruits such as chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), {{and seeds}} are also eaten. Two grey jays were seen eating slime mold (Fuligo septica) near Kennedy Hot Springs in the Glacier Peak Wilderness, Washington. This {{was the first}} report of any bird {{consuming}} slime mold in the field. Risk and energy expenditure are factors in food selection for the grey jay, which selects food {{on the basis of}} profitability to maximize caloric intake. Increased handling, searching, or recognition times for a preferred food item lowers its profitability. Grey jays wrench, twist, and tug food apart, unlike other birds known as jays (such as the blue jay, Cyanocitta cristata), which grasp and hammer their food. Grey jays commonly carry large food items to nearby <b>trees</b> <b>to</b> eat or process for storage, possibly as defense against large scavengers.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, Darwin {{published}} The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, {{which contained}} {{his views on}} human evolution. Darwin argued that {{the differences between the}} human mind and the minds of the higher animals were a matter of degree rather than of kind. For example, he viewed morality as a natural outgrowth of instincts that were beneficial to animals living in social groups. He argued that all the differences between humans and apes were explained by a combination of the selective pressures that came from our ancestors moving from the <b>trees</b> <b>to</b> the plains, and sexual selection. The debate over human origins, and over the degree of human uniqueness continued well into the 20th century.|$|E
