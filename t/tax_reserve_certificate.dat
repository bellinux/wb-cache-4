40|$|Abstract We utilize new income <b>tax</b> <b>reserve</b> {{disclosures}} {{required under}} FIN 48 {{to examine whether}} managers use discretion over this accrual to manage earnings to meet the consensus analyst forecast. We find that firms with pre-managed earnings (i. e., earnings before {{the change in the}} <b>tax</b> <b>reserve)</b> that are below the consensus analyst forecast {{are far more likely to}} reduce their <b>tax</b> <b>reserves</b> and thus report higher net income. In fact, we find that 37 percent of firm-years with pre-managed earnings below the consensus forecast meet the forecast when the change in the <b>tax</b> <b>reserve</b> is included in earnings. In contrast, only 9. 8 percent of firm-years with pre-managed earnings above the consensus forecast increased their <b>tax</b> <b>reserves</b> to the extent that it caused them to miss the consensus forecast. This asymmetric result is consistent with managers using their discretion over <b>tax</b> <b>reserves</b> to meet consensus analyst forecasts. Using a proxy for changes in <b>tax</b> <b>reserves</b> developed by Blouin and Tuna (2007), we also document a decline in the use of <b>tax</b> <b>reserves</b> to meet the consensus analyst forecast following the adoption of FIN 48. Nonetheless, our results using both estimated and actual changes in <b>tax</b> <b>reserves</b> clearly suggest that managers continue to use their discretion over this account to meet the consensus analys...|$|R
40|$|I {{examine the}} extent to which acquirers {{exercise}} discretion in the application of FIN 48 when estimating target <b>tax</b> <b>reserves.</b> By examining the change in target <b>tax</b> <b>reserves</b> recorded through purchase accounting, I am able to hold constant the underlying tax positions, and any changes can be attributed to differences in how the managers of the target and acquirer apply the recognition and measurement principles of FIN 48. For a sample of large public-for-public M 2 ̆ 6 A transactions in which the amount of target <b>tax</b> <b>reserves</b> is observable pre- and post-acquisition, approximately one third (half) of the acquirers adjust target <b>tax</b> <b>reserves</b> by more than half (a quarter) of the preexisting balance. Substantially more acquirers increase rather than decrease target <b>tax</b> <b>reserves,</b> and the average change in target <b>tax</b> <b>reserves</b> recorded through purchase accounting is 25 million. I also find evidence that the change in <b>tax</b> <b>reserves</b> recorded through purchase accounting is increasing in short-term financial reporting pressures and decreasing in the costs of overstating goodwill...|$|R

40|$|The {{possibility}} to smooth income by appropriating parts of Operating Profit before <b>Taxes</b> to Untaxed <b>Reserves</b> {{are assumed to}} {{play a vital role}} in financing firms, particularly small firms. Nevertheless, little attention has been given to these issues by academics in the accounting literature, especially concerning small firms in Sweden. Initially, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of Untaxed Reserves in terms of appropriating funds to the <b>Tax</b> Allocation <b>Reserve</b> in order to smooth income. Then, we analyze the impact of variables measuring financial performance and capital structure while controlling for contextual variables which are believed to be significant in predicting the use of the <b>Tax</b> Allocation <b>Reserve.</b> The results suggest amongst else that more profitable and financially viable firms in urban areas have a higher probability of appropriating to the <b>Tax</b> Allocation <b>Reserve</b> than others. Contrary to our prior belief, the smallest firms have a higher probability than larger firms of smooothing income by appropriating funds to the <b>Tax</b> Allocation <b>Reserve...</b>|$|R

This study examines two types of consequences of FIN 48, the effect of FIN 48 on firm value and the effect of FIN 48 on audit fees, and shows that these consequences depend upon the size of the firm. Firm size {{and the role of the}} auditor are generally ignored in previous FIN 48 -related studies. Because of different tax audit risks faced by firms of different sizes, I expect and find that FIN 48 affects firms or different sizes differently. After the adoption of FIN 48, the value relevance of <b>tax</b> <b>reserves</b> decreases for large firms but does not significantly change for medium and small firms. I also find that firms pay additional audit fees following FIN 48 and that the increase depends upon the size of the firm and the extent of tax services provided by the auditor. In addition, auditor-provided tax services mitigate the extra audit fees that firms with more <b>tax</b> <b>reserves</b> need to pay in the post-FIN 48 period. This study also investigates the effect of auditor-provided tax services on earnings management through <b>tax</b> <b>reserves.</b> I find that the auditor who provides more tax services facilitates large firms' earnings smoothing in the post-FIN 48 period, providing clear evidence of impairment of auditor independence due to tax services. This behavior does not exist within medium and small firms, arguably because the auditor does not compromise independence for less important clients...|$|R

Results show that increases in reserve requirements significantly lower bank returns implying that shareholders share a portion of the required <b>reserve</b> <b>tax.</b> Required <b>reserves</b> changes are partially predicted by investors, and increases and decreases in required reserve rates have an asymmetric effect on stock returns. In addition, large and public banks bear a larger share of the tax, and the remuneration of reserves has important implications for the tax burden.

40|$|We {{evaluate}} whether, {{and under}} what circumstances, corporate tax aggressiveness influences audit pricing. Using a compound measure of two long-run effective tax rates, we find that tax-aggressive firms pay higher fees for external audit services after controlling for factors related to earnings management. The fee premium increases with management’s uncertainty about the sustainability of tax positions if audited by tax authorities (i. e., disclosed <b>tax</b> <b>reserves).</b> Further, the provision of auditor-provided tax services may create knowledge spillovers that alleviate the fee premium for tax aggressiveness, unless tax uncertainty is high. Finally, an accounting firm’s industry expertise in auditing is associated with higher audit fees independent of tax aggressiveness, whereas industry expertise in taxation leads to a fee premium only for tax-aggressive clients. Overall, the evidence implies firms’ aggressive tax behavior, tax services provider, and auditor expertise interact to influence the pricing of audit engagements. status: publishe...|$|R

Their cognitive base determined by their formal education serves them to perceive situations {{about what is going on}} and what should be done about these situations (Hambrick and Mason 1984). A respective education for tax issues give auditors by assumption also the ability to know extreme tax planning arrangements and in turn, to make a decision on that in their position as auditors. Also for pure auditing services as well as for audit quality tax knowledge is particularly relevant. For example, tax knowledge is useful when evaluating tax accruals, tax expense, tax liabilities, and <b>tax</b> <b>reserves</b> (see Gleason and Mills 2011; Janssen 2015) or when assessing the fiscal consequences and risks associated with a particular strategy (McGuire et al. 2012).

Different career paths of individual auditors going hand in hand with less procedural knowledge in tax preparation in comparison to pure tax consultants is therefore not expected to matter for the auditors’ ability to assess tax issues.
