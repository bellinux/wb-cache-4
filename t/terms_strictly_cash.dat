50|$|In {{the fictional}} {{universe}} of Spider Robinson, Callahan's Place is a bar with strongly community-minded and empathic clientele. It {{appears in the}} Callahan's Crosstime Saloon stories (compiled in the first novel of the same name) along with its sequels Time Travelers <b>Strictly</b> <b>Cash</b> and Callahan's Secret; most of the beloved barflies appear in the further sequels The Callahan Touch, Callahan's Legacy, Callahan's Key, and Callahan's Con, and the computer game.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>term</b> <b>strictly</b> {{refers to}} the {{transmission}} of microorganisms directly from one individual to another {{by one or more}} of the following means: ...|$|R
50|$|The French Red Cross {{launched}} an appeal, {{stating that the}} appeal was <b>strictly</b> for <b>cash</b> donations and not for clothing or furniture.|$|R
50|$|Caution is {{required}} when discussing increasing or decreasing return loss since these <b>terms</b> <b>strictly</b> {{have the opposite}} meaning when return loss {{is defined as a}} negative quantity.|$|R
5000|$|Moist — The ABC {{uses this}} <b>term</b> <b>strictly</b> {{to refer to}} {{otherwise}} dry counties where one or more specific cities have voted to allow alcohol sales for off-premises consumption.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you understand, sir," [...] he enquired, [...] "that this is <b>strictly</b> a <b>cash</b> affair? I {{must have}} notes {{for the amount}} at the {{conclusion}} of the sale." ...|$|R
5000|$|Serunding - spiced meat floss. Serunding {{may also}} refer to any dish where the primary meat or {{vegetable}} ingredient is shredded and pulled into thin strands. In Indonesia, this <b>term</b> <b>strictly</b> {{refers to a}} dry-toasted grated coconut mix instead.|$|R
50|$|The <b>term</b> <b>strictly</b> {{excludes}} those Aramaic languages {{that are}} used only as literary, sacred or classical languages today (for example, Targumic Aramaic, Classical Syriac and Classical Mandaic). However, the classical languages continue to have influence over the colloquial Neo-Aramaic languages.|$|R
50|$|A strong {{envelope}} with an imprinted stamp sold only {{for use with}} the registered mail service. Confusingly, these are usually marked Registered Letter but that <b>term</b> <b>strictly</b> only relates to a normal letter or packet that has extra postage and markings applied so that it may travel under the registered mail service.|$|R
40|$|This essay {{starts from}} the {{well-known}} definition of populus {{as well as}} it appears in some Cicero’s works and aims at analyze the religious significance of coetus, a <b>term</b> <b>strictly</b> connected with the first, at least focusing on the 16 th book of the Theodosian Code. This article intends to cast light some transformations and representations of religious groups between Constantinian and Post-Constantinian ages...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{after this}} little {{experience}} I thought that I would settle down a bit, so I entered upon a venture {{with a man}} who, being of a speculative mind, had conceived the idea of running a store at Pretoria upon <b>strictly</b> <b>cash</b> principles. The arrangement was that I should find the capital and he the experience. Our partnership was not of a long duration. The Boers refused to pay cash, {{and at the end}} of four months my partner had the capital and I had the experience. After this I came to the conclusion that store-keeping was not in my line, and having four hundred pounds left, I sent my boy Harry to a school in Natal, and buying an outfit with what remained of the money, started upon a big trip.|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} {{fundamental}} solutions {{has been used}} to study adiabatic transition amplitudes in two energy level systems for a class of Hamiltonians allowing some simplifications of Stokes graphs corresponding to such transitions. It has been shown that for simplest such cases the amplitudes take the Nikitin - Umanskii form but for more complicated ones they are formed by a sum of <b>terms</b> <b>strictly</b> related to a structure of Stokes graph corresponding to such cases...|$|R
60|$|Speaking with strict propriety, therefore, {{we should}} call a man a great painter only as he excelled in {{precision}} and force {{in the language of}} lines, and a great versifier, as he excelled in precision or force in the language of words. A great poet would then be a <b>term</b> <b>strictly,</b> and in precisely the same sense applicable to both, if warranted by the character of the images or thoughts which each in their respective languages convey.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, Mr. Bingham," [...] he said, [...] "if {{you want}} to move, {{would you like a}} room here? <b>Terms</b> <b>strictly</b> moderate, but can't afford to put you up for nothing you know, and living rough and ready. You'd have to take us as you find us; but there is a dressing-room next to my room, where your little girl could sleep, and my daughters would look after her between them, and be glad of the job." ...|$|R
50|$|The two {{brothers}} quickly brought new ideas into the shop: customers {{were allowed to}} replace goods, {{the price of a}} good was no longer debatable but reliable, and purchases were made <b>strictly</b> with <b>cash.</b> This concept was successful, and after the opening of another branch in Rostock, the first branch in Berlin (Rosenthaler Straße) was founded in 1885.|$|R
3000|$|... is similar). Then {{the sum of}} {{the first}} three terms in (2.20) is non-positive and the fourth <b>term</b> is <b>strictly</b> negative, which contradicts [...]...|$|R
3000|$|According to {{the civil}} procedure, naming the wrong reason for a case may affect its qualification, trial, and {{applicable}} legal <b>terms.</b> <b>Strictly</b> speaking, a case with a wrong case reason requires a big change in the trial procedure, in order to correct mistakes in its case filing. However, in actual practice, it is not so. Judge E frankly said: “Case reasons can be adjusted during the trial process, which emphasizes substantive justice rather than the procedural justice advocated by laws.” [...]...|$|R
5000|$|Brussels lace {{is a type}} of {{pillow lace}} that {{originated}} in and around Brussels. The term [...] "Brussels lace" [...] has been broadly used for any lace from Brussels; however, the <b>term</b> <b>strictly</b> interpreted refers to bobbin lace, in which the pattern is made first, then the ground, or réseau, added, also using bobbin lace. Brussels lace is {{not to be confused with}} Brussels point, which {{is a type of}} needle lace, though is sometimes also called [...] "Brussels lace".|$|R
5000|$|The Gates Valley is {{a valley}} and group of {{communities}} in the Lillooet Country of the Southern Interior of British Columbia, Canada, located between the summit of Pemberton Pass {{and the head of}} Anderson Lake at the community of D'Arcy. Though the <b>term</b> <b>strictly</b> refers to the valley of the Gates River, it is usually used more in a sense of the communities located in the valley and is not a term used for the river's drainage basin, which is much larger.|$|R
5000|$|The Glastonbury thorn {{is a form}} {{of common}} hawthorn, Crataegus monogyna 'Biflora' (sometimes {{incorrectly}} called Crataegus oxyacantha var. praecox), found in and around Glastonbury, Somerset, England. Unlike ordinary hawthorn trees, it flowers twice a year (hence the name [...] "biflora"), the first time in winter and the second time in spring. The trees in the Glastonbury area have been propagated by grafting since ancient times. The tree is also widely called the holy thorn, though this <b>term</b> <b>strictly</b> speaking refers to the original (legendary) tree.|$|R
5000|$|While the novated lease {{is only a}} part of {{the salary}} {{packaging}} arrangement, the whole arrangement is often described as a [...] "novated lease" [...] even though the <b>term</b> <b>strictly</b> applies only to the lease for the finance of the vehicle which has been novated. This usage of [...] "novated lease" [...] is almost universal on documentation, advertising and the websites of salary packaging companies and leads to confusion about whether it is the whole arrangement or just the lease itself which is meant by the term.|$|R
50|$|A {{problem that}} causes {{confusion}} {{is a lack}} of standardisation in the definitions. For example, some authors use the <b>terms</b> <b>strictly</b> positive and positive to mean > 0 and ≥ 0 respectively. In this article positive means > 0 and non-negative means ≥ 0. Another vexed area concerns decomposability and reducibility: irreducible is an overloaded term. For avoidance of doubt a non-zero non-negative square matrix A such that 1 + A is primitive is sometimes said to be connected. Then irreducible non-negative square matrices and connected matrices are synonymous.|$|R

50|$|In December 1987, Atari {{became a}} {{licensee}} of Nintendo and gained {{the rights to}} make video games for the NES. The license <b>terms</b> <b>strictly</b> controlled Atari's access to the console technology. To sell a video game, Atari was required to give the game to Nintendo, and Nintendo would place the game on cartridges equipped with 10NES and resell them to Atari. The license also contained an exclusivity term that prohibited licensees from creating adaptations of such games for other consoles {{for a period of}} two years following the first sale.|$|R
50|$|A {{full-length}} {{feature film}} about Rana {{was made in}} 1974 titled Masud Rana. Masud Parves, who is known by his stage name Sohel Rana directed and starred in it. The film {{is based on the}} story Bishmaron Amnesia (which in turn is based on <b>Strictly</b> for <b>Cash..</b> by James Hadley Chase.) It is the 11th story in the series and was first published on 1967.|$|R
50|$|Today, {{while some}} may still use the <b>term</b> <b>strictly</b> in the old-fashioned sense (i.e., the romanticized Old Guard), {{more than ever}} the leather {{subculture}} {{in the 21st century}} represents the activities of several major sub-communities. These include BDSM practitioners, whether high, low, or no protocol, and whether gay, lesbian, straight or bisexual. They also include people who have a preference for aggressive or masculine sexual styles; people who love motorcycles; people involved in kink or leather fetishism; and people who participate in large-scale cultural and marketing events such as Folsom Street Fair or leather-themed circuit parties.|$|R
5000|$|The {{resulting}} rather severe write-up of {{the topic}} (by Bourbaki) entirely rejected one approach in vector calculus (the quaternion route, that is, in the general case, the relation with Lie groups). They instead applied a novel approach using category theory, with the Lie group approach viewed as a separate matter. Since {{this leads to a}} much cleaner treatment, there was probably no going back in purely mathematical <b>terms.</b> (<b>Strictly,</b> the universal property approach was invoked; this is somewhat more general than category theory, and {{the relationship between the two}} as alternate ways was also being clarified, at the same time.) ...|$|R
5000|$|By 1990 Westlake {{had become}} a grim area [...] "where heroin addicts and {{youthful}} gang members control the public alleyways and clamber across people's rooftops to elude police." [...] An alley {{had become a}} refuge for the homeless, with no toilets, and piles of garbage were accumulating.The neighborhood was replete with sidewalk vendors in 1993, from whom sometimes gang members, called cholos, were demanding [...] "rent" [...] to use the public sidewalks, which were bustling with refugees from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and other Latin American couintries. It was said that trepidation, or fear, was [...] "the price of {{living and working in}} the Westlake district." [...] People lived on the underground economy, <b>strictly</b> <b>cash,</b> and the district was infested with [...] "some of the city's largest and most menacing street gangs," [...] with police and residents complaining of drug dealing, prostitution, thievery and extortion. Yet there was an air of economic energy and potential, with {{the vast majority of the}} residents just wanting to make an honest living.|$|R
50|$|Lindberg {{renamed the}} order Docoglossa to Patellogastropoda in 1986. He is also notable for naming the {{subclass}} Eogastropoda, and proposing that the taxonomy of the Gastropoda be rewritten in <b>terms</b> of <b>strictly</b> monophyletic groups.|$|R
5000|$|Informally, HTML {{elements}} are {{sometimes referred to}} as [...] "tags" [...] (an example of synecdoche), though many prefer the <b>term</b> tag <b>strictly</b> in reference to the markup delimiting the start and end of an element.|$|R
25|$|Third, {{they have}} sought to {{increase}} the methods of payment processing available {{to the general public}} and business clients. These products include debit cards, prepaid cards, smart cards, and credit cards. They make it easier for consumers to conveniently make transactions and smooth their consumption over time (in some countries with underdeveloped financial systems, it is still common to deal <b>strictly</b> in <b>cash,</b> including carrying suitcases filled with cash to purchase a home).|$|R
50|$|While, the {{exceptions}} would generally {{account for a}} very small proportion of overall production, the <b>term</b> applies, <b>strictly</b> speaking, only to the production which was standardised, where many workers {{would be involved in}} the making of each item.|$|R
