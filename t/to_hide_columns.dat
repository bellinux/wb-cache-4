50|$|Glass {{may be used}} {{which is}} transparent, {{translucent}}, or opaque, or in varying degrees thereof. Transparent glass usually refers to vision glass in a curtain wall. Spandrel or vision glass may also contain translucent glass, which could be for security or aesthetic purposes. Opaque glass is used in areas <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> a <b>column</b> or spandrel beam or shear wall behind the curtain wall. Another method of hiding spandrel areas is through shadow box construction (providing a dark enclosed space behind the transparent or translucent glass). Shadow box construction creates a perception of depth behind the glass that is sometimes desired.|$|R
50|$|At the Battle of Ostrach, he was {{attached}} to the Advanced Guard, commanded by François Joseph Lefebvre, and he was caught between the Austrian and French fire at the village of Hosskirch; his troops took heavy casualties. Unable to escape from the village without being defeated, he took advantage of a thick fog <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> his <b>column.</b> He maneuvered through the channel of the Ostrach and managed to join with the 2nd Division at Riedhausen. Jourdan praised him for his coolness and courage under fire in this dangerous and difficult withdrawal. Later that same year, while in the Army of the Rhine, he was at the siege of Philipsburg.|$|R
50|$|The High Altar in {{the central}} nave is formed from the {{sarcophagus}} of the Archbishop Pietro Capuano (died 1214). Above the altar is a painting by Andrea dell'Asta of The Martyrdom of St. Andrew. The boxed ceiling dates to 1702 and its artwork includes the Flagellation, the Crucifixion of the Apostle, and the Dell'Asta's 1710 Miracle of the Manna. The triumphal arch is held up by two Egyptian granite columns. There are two additional twisted columns and two pulpits {{that were part of}} the 12th century ambo. One of the pillars boasts a <b>hidden</b> <b>column</b> {{as an example of the}} ancient Romanesque structure.|$|R
50|$|The 1900 Exposition was {{the largest}} and most {{successful}} of them all, occupying most of the space along the Seine from the Champs-de-Mars and Trocadero to the Place de la Concorde. The Grand Palais, the largest exhibition hall, was designed by architect Henri Deglane, assisted by Albert Louvet. Deglane had been an assistant to Dufert, the builder of the Palace of Machines. The new building contained an enormous gallery, whose arches converged to create a monumental glass dome. Though its visible iron framework made it appear very revolutionary and modern, much of its iron work purely decorative; the gothic iron columns which seemed to support the dome did not carry any weight; the weight was actually distributed <b>to</b> reinforced <b>columns</b> <b>hidden</b> behind the balconies. The facade was massive and neoclassical, with towering rows of columns supporting two sculptural ensembles. It served both to give a strong vertical element to balance the great width of the building, and to conceal the glass and steel structure behind. It was also designed to be in harmony with the historic buildings nearby, including the buildings around the Place de la Concorde and the 17th century church of Les Invalides {{on the other side of}} the Seine. The facade was greatly admired and widely imitated; a similar facade was given to the New York Public Library in 1911.|$|R
