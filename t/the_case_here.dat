5|$|Van Eyck's {{earlier work}} often shows churches and cathedrals in older Romanesque style, {{sometimes}} {{to represent the}} Temple in Jerusalem as an appropriate historical setting, with decoration drawn exclusively from the Old Testament. That is clearly not <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>here</b> – the Christ Child occupies the same space as a large rood cross depicting him being crucified. The church in this panel is contemporary Gothic – a choice perhaps intended to associate Mary with the Ecclesia Triumphans – while her pose and oversized scale are indebted to the forms and conventions of Byzantine art and the International Gothic. Van Eyck details the architecture with a precision not seen before in northern European painting.|$|E
500|$|McHugh {{suggested}} that detention for a non-punitive purpose could still offend Chapter III if it prevented a court [...] "from determining some matter {{that is a}} condition precedent to authorising detention." [...] However, that was not <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>here.</b>|$|E
500|$|Warren {{concluded}} {{that the nature of}} the Texas law at issue denied Washington the right for a fair trial using witnesses who could testify to [...] "relevant and material" [...] facts in <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> <b>Here,</b> while not entirely relying on the finding, the Court saw the law as [...] "arbitrary" [...] because its discrimination between the prosecution and defense served [...] "no rational relationship" [...] to any goal of preventing perjury. Further, the idea that a [...] "competent" [...] witness was barred from testifying, in and of itself, was held to be an unconstitutional predetermination {{on the part of the}} state legislature. The Court's decision upheld the importance of juries in evaluating the truth and credibility of witnesses' statements.|$|E

500|$|A {{density of}} more than 5g/cm3 is {{sometimes}} mentioned as a common heavy metal defining factor and, {{in the absence of}} a unanimous definition, is used to populate this list and (unless otherwise stated) guide the remainder of the article. Metalloids meeting the applicable criteria–arsenic and antimony for example—are sometimes counted as heavy metals, [...] particularly in environmental chemistry, as is <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>here.</b> Selenium (density 4.8g/cm3) is also included in the list. It falls marginally short of the density criterion and is less commonly recognised as a metalloid but has a waterborne chemistry similar in some respects to that of arsenic and antimony. Other metals sometimes classified or treated as [...] "heavy" [...] metals, such as beryllium (density 1.8 g/cm3), aluminium (2.7 g/cm3), calcium (1.55 g/cm3), and barium (3.6 g/cm3) are here treated as light metals and, in general, are not further considered.|$|E
2500|$|When {{faced with}} a case where {{dimensional}} analysis rejects a variable ( [...] , here) that one intuitively expects to belong in a physical description of the situation, {{another possibility is that}} the rejected variable is in fact relevant, but that some other relevant variable has been omitted, which might combine with the rejected variable to form a dimensionless quantity. That is, however, not <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>here.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The third-century BC translators who {{produced}} the Greek Septuagint rendered the phrase [...] "God took him" [...] with the Greek verb metatithemi (μετατίθημι) meaning {{moving from one}} place to another. Sirach 44:16, from about the same period, states that [...] "Enoch pleased God and was translated into paradise that he may give repentance to the nations." [...] The Greek word used here for paradise, 'paradeisos' (παράδεισος), was derived from an ancient Persian word meaning [...] "enclosed garden", and was used in the Septuagint to describe the garden of Eden. Later, however, the term became synonymous for heaven, as is <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>here.</b>|$|E
2500|$|An {{example of}} the rush of plastic model {{suppliers}} to produce promos for the next model year {{was seen in the}} Jo-Han 1968 AMC Ambassador convertible, a car never manufactured in reality because AMC discontinued the convertible body style from the Ambassador line after the 1967 model year. [...] Oddly, though, Jo-Han's Ambassador promo led to one of the few kits that Jo-Han made that was not offered as a promo first. This was the 1970 Rebel Machine. [...] An insert could be taken out of the Ambassador promo chassis to make the shorter wheelbase models like the Rebel - which was <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>here.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Some reviewers of I, Claudius, the prefatory {{volume to}} Claudius the God, {{suggested}} that in writing it I had merely consulted Tacitus's Annals and Suetonius's Twelve Caesars, run them together, and expanded the result {{with my own}} [...] "vigorous fancy." [...] This was not so; nor is it <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>here.</b> Among the Classical writers who have been borrowed from {{in the composition of}} Claudius the God are Tacitus, Cassius Dio, Suetonius, Pliny, Varro, Valerius Maximus, Orosius, Frontinus, Strabo, Caesar, Columella, Plutarch, Josephus, Diodorus Siculus, Photius, Xiphilinus, Zonaras, Seneca, Petronius, Juvenal, Philo, Celsus, the authors of the Acts of the Apostles and of the pseudo-gospels of Nicodemus and St. James, and Claudius himself in his surviving letters and speeches.|$|E

[...] Archie Watt from MovieCues said: [...] "I sincerely hope that Powell’s work will be rewarded with an Oscar in 2011. It couldn’t be more deserved—the score is by far the best of the year to date, and I can’t foresee any other score taking that accolade from this masterpiece." [...] Both reviewers named it as the Best Score of the Year.|$|E
2500|$|The {{figures on}} the next two tiers turn {{slightly}} towards Christ's large icon in the central axis of the iconostasis. The third tier, above the Feasts is called the Apostles' tier. As this row has 12 paintings like the Feasts tier, it would be logical to suppose each icon displayed one of Jesus' disciples. But that is not <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>here,</b> in fact only eight of the twelve apostles appear on this tier. From the left, the first icon depicts apostle Thomas. The [...] "doubting" [...] disciple was originally a carpenter. He holds a spear in his right hand, symbolizing his martyrdom in India. Bartholomew is the next in the row. Originally he was a peasant, {{and according to the}} Christian legend, he died in Armenia, flayed alive and crucified, head downward. Bartholomew holds his own flayed skin in his hand as a symbol of his death. The next apostle is Andrew, Peter's brother. Legend says that he was crucified in Patras, Greece on a Crux decussata (X-shaped cross), now commonly known as a Saint Andrew's Cross. He is portrayed with this cross. Andrew is followed by Mark the Evangelist. He was painted with a quill in his right hand, and his own gospel in his left. Close to him is the icon of Matthew the Evangelist, who was painted in a rather similar way to Mark. Red and white shades dominate his garment too, and he also holds a quill and his gospel. The last icon {{on the left side of}} the Apostles tier, the closest to Jesus' central image, portrays Peter. He was the leader of the apostles, and though he died as a martyr in Rome, he is not associated with his martyrdom on the icon. He holds the Keys of Heaven in his hands.|$|E
