5|$|Aside from Nikki, Victor {{is known}} for his {{relationship}} with Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson). While Ashley was at a low point in her life, he had an affair with her. This led to her pregnancy, which he left Nikki for. However, Nikki was diagnosed with cancer and he returned to her, and Ashley aborted her baby; a move she regretted for many years. Ashley stole his sperm many years later, and had a child, Abby Carlton. Abby was believed to be Brad Carlton's (Don Diamont) daughter until she was five years old. Victor was married to Ashley from 1990 to 1993. In 2008, Victor married Sabrina Costelana (Raya Meddine), which was short-lived following her accidental death. Afterward, he left town and Ashley tracked him down when nobody else could. They reconnected their romantic relationship, later remarried and Ashley became pregnant. Davidson stated she was surprised by Ashley's pregnancy, but decided <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> storyline as it was unexpected. Victor and Ashley's second marriage ended after she miscarried the child.|$|E

25|$|In 1965, Adrian Cronauer {{arrives in}} Saigon {{to work as}} a DJ for Armed Forces Radio Service. Cronauer is met at the airport by PFC Edward Garlick. Cronauer's {{attitude}} and demeanor contrasts sharply with many staff members. His show consists of irreverent humor segments and rock and roll, which are frowned upon by his superiors, Second Lieutenant Steven Hauk and Sergeant Major Phillip Dickerson. Hauk adheres to strict Army guidelines in terms of humor and music programming, while Dickerson is generally abusive to all enlisted men. However, Brigadier General Taylor and the other DJs quickly grow <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> new man and his brand of comedy.|$|E
500|$|The Kinks' Dave Davies {{has claimed}} to dislike Van Halen's {{rendition}} of the song, saying [...] "There's the thing: good art isn't always about having the comfiest technique. I shouldn't encourage him, but I'm sure Eddie Van Halen played better when he was drunk." [...] He also told of how a concert-goer approached him after a live show and congratulated him on performing a [...] "great cover of the Van Halen song."

In an {{interview}} with NME, Gaga explained that the main inspiration behind the song was singer Whitney Houston and also added: [...] "This song is about me going back to New York. I wrote this about the courage it took for me to say 'I hate Hollywood, I just wanna live in Brooklyn and make music'".|$|E
500|$|The {{creation}} of Jason Teague was something handed {{down by the}} network, who wanted Lana {{to have a new}} boyfriend—one who was [...] "different from Clark". Gough and Millar were apprehensive because they were already introducing Lois Lane into the series, and introducing two new characters would be difficult. The pair thought about where the relationship between Clark and Lana had left off at the end of season three, and they realized that Clark had turned his back on Lana. Gough and Millar began <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> idea of bringing in a new character, one that would create a new love triangle; eventually they tied him into the larger storyline involving the three Kryptonian stones of knowledge.|$|E

Once a Pokémon's gauge is empty, the player may [...] "Purify" [...] the Pokémon by {{bringing}} {{him or her}} to Celebi's shrine in Agate Village, or by using a rare [...] "Time Flute" [...] item. Purifying Shadow Pokémon is desirable because while in that status, they will often disobey the player, they cannot gain experience points, and their moves are at first restricted to [...] "Shadow Rush". Additionally, Shadow Pokémon will sporadically enter [...] "Hyper Mode" [...] state during battle, causing them to disobey the player character or attack themselves until the condition is alleviated by selecting the [...] "Call" [...] battle command.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the season}} finale aired, Miller and the writers {{proposed}} the storyline for season two to ABC and to Warner Bros. [...] They pitched the idea of season two exploring the ramifications of Jo or another character, aside from Abe, learning about Henry's immortality, romance, and the pleasures associated with immortality. [...] They also planned to introduce several new characters to the series. [...] In an interview with Entertainment Weeklys Natalie Abrams, Miller stated that ABC appeared <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> direction of the show's second season. [...] On May 7, however, ABC announced the series' cancellation. Gruffudd's wife Alice Evans told fans about the cancellation on Twitter; Gruffudd posted a letter on Instagram detailing his reaction to the series' cancellation and thanking the show's fans for their support a few hours later.|$|E
500|$|Composer Mark Snow {{worked with}} {{producer}} Ken Horton to create Smallvilles score. Snow composed music {{as he watched}} the picture, and tweaked his performance when he reviewed his initial recordings. He then sent the music to the producers, who sent it back for recomposition if needed. Individual episodes have their own soundtrack, comprising one (or more) songs. Jennifer Pyken and Madonna Wade-Reed of Daisy Music looked for songs for the soundtrack. Their choices were discussed by the producers, who decided which songs they wanted and secured their rights. Although Snow said it initially seemed odd to combine two types of music on a [...] "typical action-adventure" [...] television show, [...] "the producers seem <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> contrast of the modern songs and the traditional, orchestral approach to the score".|$|E

His children later commented {{that they found}} the castle was chilly and cramped. The Prime Minister, Asquith, was invited by Beauchamp to use the castle during the First World War as a weekend retreat, as it had good communication links with the front line in France. Asquith's wife, Margot, was not initially impressed by Walmer, noting in her diary that while it was [...] "very distinguished" [...] and had [...] "great charm", it was [...] "terribly exposed" [...] with [...] "cold... noisy corridors and small rooms"; she later came <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> castle and noted that she was sad to finally leave it.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to {{his role in the}} television series, Dale's comic book counterpart is among the longest surviving characters in the series, and he enters into a sexual relationship with Andrea. Kirkman asserted that it was necessary for writers to distance the development of Dale's television character from that in the comic: [...] "I have talked many times how much I like the difference between the comics and the show. There are going to be big plot lines that we may not necessarily get <b>to,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> romance between Dale and Andrea. If you think you really want to read that story line, that's available in the comics, and I highly recommend you pick those up. The show {{is always going to be}} a different animal and the decision to kill Dale off was a big one and it wasn't one that was made lightly." ...|$|E
500|$|Orci and Kurtzman {{said they}} wanted the general {{audience}} <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> film {{as much as the}} fans, by stripping away [...] "Treknobabble", making it action-packed and giving it the simple title of Star Trek to indicate to newcomers they would not need to watch any of the other films. Abrams saw humor and sex appeal as two integral and popular elements of the show that needed to be maintained. Orci stated being realistic and being serious were not the same thing. Abrams, Burk, Lindelof, Orci and Kurtzman were fans of The Wrath of Khan, and also cited The Next Generation episode [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise" [...] as an influence. Abrams' wife Katie was regularly consulted on the script, as were Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof's wives, to make the female characters as strong as possible. Katie Abrams' approval of the strong female characters was partly why Abrams signed on to direct.|$|E

500|$|The two symphonies divide opinion {{even more}} sharply. Mason rates the Second poorly for its [...] "over-obvious rhythmic scheme", but calls the First [...] "Elgar's masterpiece. ... It {{is hard to}} see how any candid student can deny the greatness of this symphony." [...] However, in the 1957 centenary symposium, several leading admirers of Elgar express {{reservations}} about one or both symphonies. In the same year, Roger Fiske wrote in The Gramophone, [...] "For some reason few people seem <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> two Elgar symphonies equally; each has its champions and often they are more than a little bored by the rival work." [...] The critic John Warrack wrote, [...] "There are no sadder pages in symphonic literature than the close of the First Symphony's Adagio, as horn and trombones twice softly intone a phrase of utter grief", whereas to Michael Kennedy, the movement is notable for its lack of anguished yearning and angst and is marked instead by a [...] "benevolent tranquillity." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2015, Bell {{looked back}} {{on the first two}} seasons and talked about the {{challenges}} of and changes in the series. He noted the negative reception from fans concerning the low number of recognizable characters like Coulson, but pointed out that fans seemed to have grown <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> series' original characters as they had been developed over time. He explained that with the increasing number of characters and complex relationships in the series, having different pairings and building new emotional relationships was important, and stated that [...] "whether it's a quiet moment or in action, we [...] deepen the audience's love and concern, and hopes for these characters." [...] A year later he reiterated the producer's intention to create a tradition moving forward of [...] "finding new combinations and new conflicts" [...] between different sets of characters, given [...] "a lot of procedurals [...] the same people doing the same thing for five years and the character don't evolve or change at all." ...|$|E

Nemec stated in a 2008interview that [...] "the initial backlash from a very small core, outspoken group of the fandom had a bit of a volatile reaction to it, which is totally natural... I'd say 95-plus percent of the fan base grew <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> character and accepted the character overall.
