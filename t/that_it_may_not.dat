5|$|Marcelo Weksler {{and colleagues}} removed {{most of the}} species then placed in Oryzomys from the genus in 2006, {{retaining}} only the marsh rice rat and related species, including O.gorgasi. They also kept O.curasoae in the genus and suggested <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be distinct from O.gorgasi. In a 2009 paper, R.S. Voss and Weksler examined the two and concluded that they represented the same species {{on the basis of}} direct comparisons and a phylogenetic analysis. The resultant tree placed O.curasoae and O.gorgasi sister to each other and closer to O.couesi than to the marsh rice rat. Accordingly, they placed O.curasoae as a junior synonym of the earlier described O.gorgasi.|$|E
5|$|Robinson's Arch is {{the name}} given to a monumental {{staircase}} carried by an unusually wide stone arch, which once stood at the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount. It was built {{as part of the}} expansion of the Second Temple initiated by Herod the Great {{at the end of the}} 1st century BCE. Recent findings suggest <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> have been completed until at least 20 years after his death. The massive stone span was constructed along with the retaining walls of the Temple Mount. It carried traffic up from ancient Jerusalem's Lower Market area and over the Tyropoeon street to the Royal Stoa complex on the esplanade of the Mount. The overpass was destroyed during the Great Jewish Revolt, only a few decades after its completion.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of its Chapter 11 filing, Blockbuster said it would keep its 3,300 stores open; In December 2010, Blockbuster {{announced}} it would close an additional 182 stores by the end of April 2011 in attempts to emerge from bankruptcy. It was reported in February 2011 that Blockbuster and its creditors had not come up with a Chapter 11 exit plan and that the company would be sold for $300 million or more, along with taking over debts and leases. Blockbuster has admitted <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be able to meet financial obligations required under its Chapter 11 filing, a circumstance which could mandate conversion of the bankruptcy filing to Chapter 7 (liquidation).

50|$|In Ontario, Canada, one {{attempt to}} define the boom came from David Foot, author of Boom, Bust and Echo: Profiting from the Demographic Shift {{in the 21st century}} (1997).

25|$|In contrast, Byrne and Mclean's {{findings}} differed {{slightly from}} Fairburn et al.s cognitive behavioral model of bulimia nervosa {{in that the}} drive for thinness was the major cause of purging {{as a way of}} controlling weight. In turn, Byrne and Mclean argued that this makes the individual vulnerable to binging, indicating {{that it is not a}} binge-purge cycle but rather a purge-binge cycle in that purging comes before bingeing. Similarly, Fairburn et al.s cognitive behavioral model of bulimia nervosa is not necessarily applicable to every individual and is certainly reductionist. Everyone differs from another, and taking such a complex behavior like bulimia and applying the same one theory to everyone would certainly be invalid. In addition, the cognitive behavioral model of bulimia nervosa is very cultural bound in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be necessarily applicable to cultures outside of the Western society. To evaluate, Fairburn et al..'s model and more generally the cognitive explanation of bulimia nervosa is more descriptive than explanatory, as it does not necessarily explain how bulimia arises. Furthermore, it is difficult to ascertain cause and effect, because it may be that distorted eating leads to distorted cognition rather than vice versa.|$|E
25|$|It {{is thought}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be {{possible}} to convert a wormhole into a time machine in this manner; the predictions {{are made in the}} context of general relativity, but general relativity does not include quantum effects. Analyses using the semiclassical approach to incorporating quantum effects into general relativity have sometimes indicated that a feedback loop of virtual particles would circulate through the wormhole and pile up on themselves, driving the energy density in the region very high and possibly destroying it before any information could be passed through it, in keeping with the chronology protection conjecture. The debate on this matter is described by Kip S. Thorne in the book Black Holes and Time Warps, and a more technical discussion can be found in The quantum physics of chronology protection by Matt Visser. There is also the Roman ring, which is a configuration of more than one wormhole. This ring seems to allow a closed time loop with stable wormholes when analyzed using semiclassical gravity, although without a full theory of quantum gravity it is uncertain whether the semiclassical approach is reliable in this case.|$|E
25|$|In April 1978 then-Transport Minister Otto Lang {{announced}} at {{a speech to}} the Board of Trade a plan to provide daily scheduled airline service between the airport and Ottawa and Montreal, using de Havilland Dash 7 STOL planes. The Government of Canada would invest $5 million in improvements at the airport including a covered moving pedestrian sidewalk linking the airport with Lake Shore Boulevard. Great Lakes Airlines proposed buying seven Dash 7s on the condition that the government subsidize the service at a rate of $8 million per year for the first three or four years. Lang stipulated that the plan would have to win local approval, and conceded <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be profitable before 1990. Local proponents at the time were the Toronto Board of Trade and unionized workers at the de Havilland plant in Downsview. Toronto City Council, notably Alderman Pat Sheppard, representing local residents of the airport, opposed the airport. Even several commissioners of the Harbour Commission, including Roy Merrens and Karl Jaffary opposed the plan. In August, Toronto City Council voted 16–6 against the STOL proposal and proposed planning amendments to prevent any STOL development. It meant the end, at least temporarily, for Lang's proposal.|$|E
