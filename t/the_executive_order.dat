25|$|Federal Actions {{to address}} the disproportionate health and {{environmental}} disparities that minority and low-income populations face through Executive Order (E.O) 12898, required federal agencies to make environmental justice central to their programs and policies.

Despite legislation specifically designed to ensure equity in Superfund listing, marginalized populations still experience a lesser chance of successful listing and cleanup than areas with higher income levels. After <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> <b>order</b> had been put in place, there persisted a discrepancy between the demographics of the communities living near toxic waste sites and their listing as Superfund sites, which would otherwise grant them federally funded cleanup projects. Communities with both increased minority and low-income populations were found to have lowered their chances of site listing after <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> <b>order,</b> while on the other hand, increases in income led to greater chances of site listing. Of the populations living within 1 mile radius of a Superfund site, 44% of those are minorities despite only being around 37% of the nation's population. It has also been shown that the government responds slower to community demands from minority communities than from white communities. Superfund sites near white communities have seen better clean up and harsher penalties for the polluters than minority communities.|$|E
