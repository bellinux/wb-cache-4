5|$|STS-300 was the {{designation}} for the Space Shuttle Launch on Need (LON) missions {{to be launched}} on short notice for STS-114 and STS-121, {{in the event that}} the shuttle became disabled or damaged and could not safely return to Earth. <b>The</b> <b>rescue</b> flight for STS-115, if needed, would have been STS-301. After STS-115, <b>the</b> <b>rescue</b> mission designations were based on the corresponding regular mission that would be replaced should <b>the</b> <b>rescue</b> mission be needed. For example, the STS-116 rescue mission was branded STS-317, because the normal mission scheduled after STS-116 was STS-117. Should <b>the</b> <b>rescue</b> mission have been needed, the crew and vehicle for STS-117 would assume <b>the</b> <b>rescue</b> mission profile and become STS-317. All potential rescue missions were to be launched with a crew of four, and would return with ten or eleven crew members, depending on the number of crew launched on the rescued shuttle. Missions were expected to last approximately eleven days. None of the planned contingency missions was ever flown.|$|E

They were able to cut a hole in the ice, and pulled her through at 19:40. Bågenholm had been in the water for 80minutes when she was rescued.|$|E
