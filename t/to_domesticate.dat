5|$|About 10,000years ago {{the humans}} who {{inhabited}} the lands around the Mediterranean basin began <b>to</b> <b>domesticate</b> wild animals. Pigs, cattle, goats, sheep, horses, camels, {{cats and dogs}} were all kept and bred in captivity. These animals would have brought their viruses with them. The transmission of viruses from animals to humans can occur, but such zoonotic infections are rare and subsequent human-to-human transmission of animal viruses is even rarer, although there are notable exceptions such as influenza. Most viruses are species-specific and would have posed no threat to humans. The rare epidemics of viral diseases originating in animals would have been short-lived because the viruses were not fully adapted to humans and the human populations were too small to maintain the chains of infection.|$|E
5|$|Mesa Verdeans {{typically}} harvested local small game, {{but sometimes}} organized hunting parties that traveled long distances. Their {{main sources of}} animal protein came from mule deer and rabbits, but they occasionally hunted Bighorn sheep, antelope, and elk. They began <b>to</b> <b>domesticate</b> turkeys starting around 1000, and by the 13th century consumption of the animal peaked, supplanting deer as the primary protein source at many sites. These domesticated turkeys consumed large amounts of corn, which further deepened reliance on the staple crop. Puebloans wove blankets from turkey feathers and rabbit fur, and made implements such as awls and needles from turkey and deer bones. Despite the availability of fish in the area's rivers and streams, archaeological evidence suggests that they were rarely eaten.|$|E
5|$|The first humans of the Colorado River basin {{were likely}} Paleo-Indians of the Clovis and Folsom cultures, who first {{arrived on the}} Colorado Plateau about 12,000 years ago. Very little human {{activity}} occurred in the watershed until {{the rise of the}} Desert Archaic Culture, which from 8,000 to 2,000 years ago constituted most of the region's human population. These prehistoric inhabitants led a generally nomadic lifestyle, gathering plants and hunting small animals (though some of the earliest peoples hunted larger mammals that became extinct in North America {{after the end of the}} Pleistocene epoch). Another notable early group was the Fremont culture, whose peoples inhabited the Colorado Plateau from 2,000 to 700 years ago. The Fremont were likely the first peoples of the Colorado River basin <b>to</b> <b>domesticate</b> crops and construct masonry dwellings; they also left behind a large amount of rock art and petroglyphs, many of which have survived to the present day.|$|E
60|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} facts, as showing how susceptible to changed conditions or to slight constitutional changes are the reproductive powers of animals, is the very general difficulty of getting those which are kept in confinement to breed; and this is frequently the only bar <b>to</b> <b>domesticating</b> wild species. Thus, elephants, bears, foxes, and numbers of species of rodents, very rarely breed in confinement; while other species do so more or less freely. Hawks, vultures, and owls hardly ever breed in confinement; neither did the falcons kept for hawking ever breed. Of the numerous small seed-eating birds kept in aviaries, hardly any breed, neither do parrots. Gallinaceous birds usually breed freely in confinement, but some do not; and even the guans and curassows, kept tame by the South American Indians, never breed. This shows that change of climate {{has nothing to do with}} the phenomenon; and, in fact, the same species that refuse to breed in Europe do so, in almost every case, when tamed or confined in their native countries. This inability to reproduce is not due to ill-health, since many of these creatures are perfectly vigorous and live very long.|$|R

5000|$|The “wild pears” of England and Wales are {{actually}} thought <b>to</b> be <b>domesticates</b> that escaped cultivation.

30|$|Some {{researchers}} {{may believe that}} such FNPs that have resulted from crop domestication should be fixed in all the landraces [31]. This hypothesis makes sense if a single mutation or FNP became the prerequisite for cultivation of a landrace as a crop, but only one such gene {{has been reported in}} rice: sh 4 [19, 20]. All tested landraces and cultivars contain a defective allele of sh 4 that reduces seed shattering. If this defective allele were the only critical feature <b>to</b> <b>domesticating</b> wild rice species, all wild rice species that contain the defective allele could be grown as crops. However, some lines of the wild rice species O. rufipogon also contain the defective sh 4 allele, but since the stature and panicles of these plants {{are similar to those of}} typical O. rufipogon, these plants cannot be successfully cultivated as a crop. Therefore, even though all cultivated rice contains this defective allele, mutation of sh 4 is not the only change required to permit the beginning of rice domestication. Recent analysis has revealed that an allele of sd 1 present in the main cultivar (i.e., IR 8) used in the green revolution [1] is found in some O. rufipogon accessions. Furthermore, the effect of the defective sd 1 allele appears to be somehow masked in some plants in the F 2 generation of a cross between an O. rufipogon line with the same sd 1 allele with IR 8, and a cultivar of O. sativa, A 58, suggesting the importance of the allele effect in combination with a certain genetic background [23].|$|R
25|$|The crucial trap for the {{development}} of agriculture is the availability of wild edible plant species suitable for domestication. Farming arose early in the Fertile Crescent since the area had an abundance of wild wheat and pulse species that were nutritious and easy <b>to</b> <b>domesticate.</b> In contrast, American farmers had to struggle to develop corn as a useful food from its probable wild ancestor, teosinte.|$|E

25|$|The Kintampo site is {{most often}} studied by archaeologists who are {{interested}} in seeing how people made the change between foraging and horticulture and agriculture as a way of producing food.

As practitioners of sedentism, derived from the word sedentary, the people of Kintampo spent more time in their villages and less time wandering around, hunting and gathering food. They took advantage of plants that were native to the area, and although technically they were not farming, they did influence the evolution of plants, effectively being some of the first <b>to</b> <b>domesticate</b> plants in Africa.|$|E

40|$|Although the {{cultural}} and nutritive importance of the turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) to precontact Native Americans and contemporary people worldwide is clear, {{little is known about}} the domestication of this bird compared <b>to</b> other <b>domesticates.</b> Mitochondrial DNA analysis of 149 turkey bones and 29 coprolites from 38 archaeological sites (200 BC–AD 1800) reveals a unique domesticated breed in the precontact Southwestern United States. Phylogeographic analyses indicate that this domestic breed originated from outside the region, but rules out the South Mexican domestic turkey (Meleagris gallopavo gallopavo) as a progenitor. A strong genetic bottleneck within the Southwest turkeys also reflects intensive human selection and breeding. This study points to at least two occurrences of turkey domestication in precontact North America and illuminates the intensity and sophistication of New World animal breeding practices...|$|R

25|$|There {{are many}} records of domesticated red foxes and others, but rarely of {{sustained}} domestication. A recent and notable {{case is the}} Russian silver fox, which resulted in visible and behavioral changes, and is {{a case study of}} an animal population modeling according to human domestication needs. The current group of domesticated silver foxes are the result of nearly fifty years of experiments in the Soviet Union and Russia <b>to</b> <b>domesticate</b> the silver morph of the red fox. This selective breeding resulted in physical and behavioral traits appearing that are frequently seen in domestic cats, dogs, and other animals, such as pigmentation changes, floppy ears, and curly tails. Notably, the new foxes became more tame, allowing themselves to be petted, whimpering to get attention and sniffing and licking their caretakers.|$|E
25|$|The {{second group}} {{proposed}} {{that there were}} three major pathways that most animal domesticates followed into domestication: (1) commensals, adapted to a human niche (e.g., dogs, cats, fowl, possibly pigs); (2) prey animals sought for food (e.g., sheep, goats, cattle, water buffalo, yak, pig, reindeer, llama and alpaca); and (3) targeted animals for draft and nonfood resources (e.g., horse, donkey, camel). The beginnings of animal domestication involved a protracted coevolutionary process with multiple stages along different pathways. Humans did not intend <b>to</b> <b>domesticate</b> animals from, {{or at least they}} did not envision a domesticated animal resulting from, either the commensal or prey pathways. In both of these cases, humans became entangled with these species as the relationship between them, and the human role in their survival and reproduction, intensified. Although the directed pathway proceeded from capture to taming, the other two pathways are not as goal-oriented and archaeological records suggest that they take place over much longer time frames.|$|E

The selected collections were allowed to intermate, and 380 progeny were evaluated between 1991 and 1994. The best eleven plants, plus three from another evaluation, had intermated, causing a second cycle to begin. Seeds from the best plants in the second cycle were passed to scientists at The Land Institute, where the research has continued.|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, I analyse {{the interpretations}} and {{reception}} of William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream in Polish theatre between 1946 and 1970. My main focus is {{to investigate the}} influence of political, historical and economic circumstances on the shape of five specific productions. Thus, A Midsummer Night's Dream emerges as a political play, which - to Polish audiences in the specified period - addressed the issues of subversion and challenge to the established authority, social distinctions and conflicts {{and the nature of}} performance under political oppression. I take Jan Kott's reinterpretation of the play in Shakespeare Our Contemporary as a vantage point for discussion about the factors that caused this shift from operatic/fairy-tale interpretations, to socio-political/anthropological readings. The first three chapters of this thesis offer insight into the cultural, historical and political background of understanding and performing Shakespeare in Poland. I demonstrate the significance of Polish Romantic and neo-Romantic drama in shaping attitudes towards Shakespeare's plays facilitating the cultural adoption of Shakespeare as a quasi-national poet. The historical chapter presents an overview of the political changes in post-war Poland, explaining how these impacted on the social and theatrical life, including the funding of the arts and the degree of state control over Polish theatre. In the critical chapter, I collate Polish scholarly approaches to A Midsummer Night's Dream, presenting socio-political, historicist and anthropological interpretations that anticipate certain trends in modem Western criticism. An overview of Slavic mythology presents ideas applicable <b>to</b> <b>domesticating</b> and visualising the supernatural elements of the play. The five post-war productions of A Midsummer Night's Dream I reconstruct in the subsequent chapters demonstrate gradual reinterpretation of the play from a feerie (B. Dabrowski, 1947), through monumental post-Romantic approach (W. Horzyca, 1946, 1948, 1953) and modernised commedia dell'arte (A. Bardini, 1959) to anthropological and socio-political readings (L.

25|$|Diamond {{argues that}} early states located {{along the same}} {{latitude}} lines were uniquely suited {{to take advantage of}} similar climates, making it easier for crops, livestock, and farming techniques to spread. Crops such as wheat and barley, were simple to grow and easy to harvest and regions suitable for their cultivation saw high population densities and the growth of early cities. The ability <b>to</b> <b>domesticate</b> herd animals, which had no natural fear of humans, high birth rates, and an innate hierarchy, gave some civilizations the advantages of free labor, fertilizers, and war animals. The east-west orientation of Eurasia allowed for knowledge capital to spread quickly and writing systems to keep track of advanced farming techniques gave people the ability to store and build upon a knowledge base across generations. Craftsmanship flourished as a surplus of food from farming allowed some groups the freedom to explore and create, which lead to the development of metallurgy and advances in technology. While the advantageous geography helped to develop early societies, the close proximity in which humans and their animals lived led to the spread of disease across Eurasia. Over several centuries, rampant disease decimated populations, but ultimately led to disease resistant communities. Diamond suggests that these chains of causation led to European and Asian civilizations holding a dominant place in the world today.|$|E
25|$|Mate {{was first}} {{consumed}} by the indigenous Guaraní and also spread by the Tupí {{people who lived in}} that part of southern Brazil and Northeast Argentina, including some areas that were Paraguayan territory before the Paraguayan War. Therefore, the scientific name of the yerba mate is Ilex paraguariensis. The consumption of yerba mate became widespread with the European colonization in the Spanish colony of Paraguay in the late 16th century, among both Spanish settlers and indigenous Guaraní, who consumed it before the Spanish arrival. Mate consumption spread in the 17th century to the Río de la Plata and from there to Chile. This widespread consumption turned it into Paraguay's main commodity above other wares such as tobacco, cotton and beef. Aboriginal labour was used to harvest wild stands. In the mid-17th century, Jesuits managed <b>to</b> <b>domesticate</b> the plant and establish plantations in their Indian reductions in the Paraguayan department of Misiones, sparking severe competition with the Paraguayan harvesters of wild strands. After their expulsion in the 1770s, the Jesuit missions – along with the yerba mate plantations – fell into ruins. The industry continued to be of prime importance for the Paraguayan economy after independence, but development in benefit of the Paraguayan state halted after the Paraguayan War (1864–1870) that devastated the country both economically and demographically.|$|E
25|$|The Middle East {{served as}} the source for many animals that could be domesticated, such as sheep, goats and pigs. This area {{was also the first}} region <b>to</b> <b>domesticate</b> the dromedary. Henri Fleisch {{discovered}} and termed the Shepherd Neolithic flint industry from the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon and suggested {{that it could have been}} used by the earliest nomadic shepherds. He dated this industry to the Epipaleolithic or Pre-Pottery Neolithic as it is evidently not Paleolithic, Mesolithic or even Pottery Neolithic. The presence of these animals gave the region a large advantage in cultural and economic development. As the climate in the Middle East changed and became drier, many of the farmers were forced to leave, taking their domesticated animals with them. It was this massive emigration from the Middle East that would later help distribute these animals to the rest of Afroeurasia. This emigration was mainly on an east-west axis of similar climates, as crops usually have a narrow optimal climatic range outside of which they cannot grow for reasons of light or rain changes. For instance, wheat does not normally grow in tropical climates, just like tropical crops such as bananas do not grow in colder climates. Some authors, like Jared Diamond, have postulated that this East-West axis is the main reason why plant and animal domestication spread so quickly from the Fertile Crescent to the rest of Eurasia and North Africa, while it did not reach through the North-South axis of Africa to reach the Mediterranean climates of South Africa, where temperate crops were successfully imported by ships in the last 500 years. Similarly, the African Zebu of central Africa and the domesticated bovines of the fertile-crescent — separated by the dry sahara desert — were not introduced into each other's region.|$|E
