Lots {{of us have}} had conversations with someone, particularly our mothers and fathers, where they have said to us: 'If I get really ill, you will end it, won't you?'

[...] Sadier responded to Gane, saying that she [...] "think we have achieved a music that will make sense <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> whether they know about Steve Reich or not."

500|$|In {{the wake}} of Deja Entendu, Brand New was pegged as an act to watch in Rolling Stones annual [...] "Hot Issue." [...] The band topped punk critics' year-end lists with the [...] "genre-defying" [...] Deja Entendu, and the album was {{described}} as a [...] "landmark album of so-called 'emo-punk'." [...] As a result of both the album's success and the band's notable underground following, Brand New found itself {{in the middle of a}} bidding war from record labels. At the time, Lane disagreed with the usage of the phrase [...] "bidding war", but conceded, [...] "There's a few labels that are definitely interested. We've been talking <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> for a while and we're narrowing it down."

[...] Unwritten rules imposed by Wintour at the Vogue offices forbid junior staff from initiating conversation with her; an editor who greeted her on the elevator was reprimanded by one of Wintour's assistants. (She calls that an exaggeration.) A visiting reporter saw a junior staff member appear visibly panicked when she realised she would {{have to be in the}} elevator with Wintour. Once a junior editor saw her trip in the hallway, walked past without offering assistance, and was later told she [...] "did absolutely the right thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Because {{of these}} influences, musical genres, and Lavigne's {{personal}} style, the media often defined her as punk, something she denied being. Lavigne's {{close friend and}} guitarist, Evan Taubenfeld, said, [...] "It's a very touchy subject <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> {{but the point is}} that Avril isn't punk, but she never really pretended to claim to come from that scene. She had pop punk music and the media ended up doing the rest". Lavigne also commented on the matter: [...] "I have been labeled like I'm this angry girl, [...] rebel... punk, and I am so not any of them." [...] Although she stated to have punk influences on her music: [...] "I like to listen a lot to punk rock music, you can notice a certain influence of punk in my music. I like an aggressive music, but pretty enough heavy pop-rock, which is what I really do." ...|$|E

[...] Despite missing the match against Brighton, Dalglish was {{confident}} that Daniel Agger and Craig Bellamy would be fit for the final. Going into the match Liverpool had not won a trophy since they beat West Ham United in the 2006 FA Cup Final.

[...] "Cater 2 U" [...] was released as the fourth and final single from Destiny Fulfilled. It was first released in the US as an extended play (EP) consisting of the audio version of the song along with four remixes on June 14, 2005.

Manson eventually returned to Smart for a successful second time, where she began to work on the then-skeletal [...] "Queer", [...] "Vow" [...] and [...] "Stupid Girl". Working on the lyrics, [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] became an [...] "anthem for a girl who won't settle for less than what she wants". Later she added, [...] " [...] really about squandering potential, [...] our version of Madonna's 'Express Yourself', but a little more subversive". Manson aimed the song as a rebuke towards a friend's foolish behaviour: [...] "A lot of females still find it difficult to find their own voice in society. It's just that women have a different set of problems from men... make the most of your potential." [...] Manson added that [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] was [...] "a song of reproach <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> we know", both male and female, and that [...] "we could have called it 'Stupid Guy,' but we thought another song about a strident female dissing a guy would be tedious." ...|$|E

500|$|Antonov {{described}} his inspiration from London as [...] "a big metropolis, it's messy, it's chaotic and intense...and it's both exotic and familiar to Americans and to Europeans". He highlighted {{the importance of}} that familiarity to different cultures because [...] "you want to communicate <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> {{when you make a}} new piece of fiction". He said that Edinburgh provided a sense of containment and a variety of architectural designs, which were combined with a futuristic vision which Antonov said was not comparable to the brass, rivets, and steam of steampunk design. Antonov and Mitton traveled to London and Edinburgh for research, taking photographs of people, places, and objects. The pair avoided the busier streets and focused on side streets and alleyways that would better suit the game's world. Mitton stated: [...] "We were trying to design the game from a rat's viewpoint...if we have a small city, from a constrained viewpoint, what are all the different angles that we can explore?". Inspiration also came from the artwork of John Atkinson Grimshaw, Canaletto, and Gustave Doré. The world map was designed as a single piece of art and was sectioned so the designers were clear on where each mission takes place.|$|E
500|$|Cox {{left his}} job as an {{insurance}} agent {{to work as a}} mortgage broker for a local company. While there he developed a reputation for unscrupulousness, which was heightened by his authorship of an unpublished 317-page manuscript entitled The Associates. The novel's protagonist, who shares many traits in common with Cox, travels the country committing mortgage fraud. Cox told co-workers about the book, and elaborated its details to them. [...] "He sent it <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> to see if they thought it worked" [...] said a former co-worker. After being fired from the company when he was convicted of mortgage fraud in 2002, Cox faked a good credit history, and used that to buy dozens of homes and properties. In one instance he used the social security number of a toddler, and all of his documents—references, bank letters, rent receipts, W-2s from nonexistent employees—were counterfeit. He used his skills as an artist to decorate the properties with elaborate art deco-style murals. Several of his future girlfriends said that his painting talents were part of his allure, though the St. Petersburg Times described his works as copies of murals by Tamara de Lempicka. Cox charmed Alison Arnold, a young local married woman, into believing he could give her a wealthy and luxurious life. While courting Arnold she said he took her to crime films such as The Italian Job and Catch Me if You Can—which he reportedly adored and watched several times—and detailed his criminal plans to her.|$|E

[...] The Palm Beach Posts Kevin Thompson [...] "thought [...] Matthew [...] did a nice job conveying a wide range of emotions—scared, haunted, frustration, horny, jealousy, just to name a few." [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly said that [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] "was partly a transitional passage in the Lost saga, a busywork episode designed to put all the characters in position for the year's big finale" [...] and [...] " [...] appendicitis [...] the kind of hardcore castaway survival plotline we haven't really seen since season 1. [...] Combined with a strong character-driven flash story, it was very old school Lost." [...] Jensen also [...] "liked how the episode neatly neutralized one of [...] least favorite season 4 moments, the Jack-Juliet smooch". [...] TV Guides Michael Ausiello wrote that [...] "Fox quietly solidified his status as one of the tube's most reliable and unshowy stalwarts" [...] and deemed him deserving of a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV gave the episode a positive review, saying that he was [...] "shocked and baffled" [...] and writing that [...] "Lost … can give me an exciting, well-done episode while making me fear where the series is going … [...] ghosts aren't my thing." [...] The Huffington Posts Jay Glatfelter decided that [...] "what made this episode great was the fact that it just contained so much story [...] Jack's flashforward [...] this one of his most interesting 'centric' episodes. … Not only was Jack's story interesting for a change, but the inclusion of [...] other characters … and giving them great story and character development [...]" [...] Daniel of TMZ graded [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] as a [...] "B".
