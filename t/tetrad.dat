5|$|A total {{lunar eclipse}} {{took place on}} April 15, 2014. It {{was the first of}} two total lunar eclipses in 2014, and the first in a <b>tetrad</b> (four total lunar eclipses in a series). Subsequent eclipses in the <b>tetrad</b> are those of October 8, 2014, April 4, 2015, and September 28, 2015.|$|E
5|$|The April 15 eclipse was {{the first}} eclipse in a tetrad; that is, four {{consecutive}} total eclipses with no partial eclipses in between. There will be another eclipse every six lunar cycles during the <b>tetrad</b> – on October 8, 2014, April 4, 2015, and September 28, 2015. The lunar year series repeats after 12 cycles, or 354 days, causing a date shift {{when compared to the}} solar calendar. This shift means the Earth's shadow will move about 11 degrees west in each subsequent eclipse.|$|E

The two diamonds on the left of a <b>tetrad</b> are the Enhancement and Retrieval qualities of the medium, both Figure qualities. The two diamonds on the right of a <b>tetrad</b> are the Obsolescence and Reversal qualities, both Ground qualities.|$|E

30|$|The chalaza-micropyle linear {{orientation}} of <b>tetrads</b> in {{other species of}} this family has been previously reported in Yucca rupicola (Watkins 1937) and Agave lechuguilla (Grove 1941). However, Wolf (1940) reported the “T” formation of <b>tetrads</b> as the most frequent arrangement in Y. aloifolia, while Regen (1941) and Cave (1948) reported that the formation of meiotic <b>tetrads</b> may take either the “T” or the linear shape in A. virginica and Hesperocallis undulata respectively.|$|R
25|$|Consider a <b>tetrad,</b> any set of 4 {{points in}} the Steiner system W24. An octad is {{determined}} by choice of a fifth point from the remaining 20. There are 5 octads possible. Hence any <b>tetrad</b> determines a partition into 6 tetrads, called a sextet, whose stabilizer in M24 is called a sextet group.|$|E

30|$|Out of {{the total}} number of {{observations}} at this stage, 73.68  % of <b>tetrads</b> possessed a linear arrangement (Fig.  1 d), however, the presence of other forms of arrangement was observed. In 21.05  % of <b>tetrads</b> of the remaining observations, the formation of <b>tetrads</b> in a “T” arrangement could be observed, where the two micropylar megaspores were found one beside the other or in an intermediate form in which the two megaspores closest to the micropyle are separated by an oblique division instead of a fully cross division (Fig.  1 f).|$|R

25|$|The {{orientation}} of furrows (relative {{to the original}} <b>tetrad</b> of microspores) classifies the pollen as sulcate or colpate. Sulcate pollen has a furrow across the middle of what was the outer face when the pollen grain was in its <b>tetrad.</b> If the pollen has only a single sulcus, it is described as monosulcate, has two sulci, as bisulcate, or more, as polysulcate. Colpate pollen has furrows other than across {{the middle of the}} outer faces. Eudicots have pollen with three colpi (tricolpate) or with shapes that are evolutionarily derived from tricolpate pollen. The evolutionary trend in plants has been from monosulcate to polycolpate or polyporate pollen.|$|E
25|$|Psychopathy, narcissism and Machiavellianism, three {{personality}} traits that are together {{referred to as}} the dark triad, share certain characteristics, such as a callous-manipulative interpersonal style. The dark <b>tetrad</b> refers to these traits with the addition of sadism.|$|E
25|$|According to Irenaeus, the {{followers}} of the Gnostics Ptolemy and Colorbasus had Aeons that {{differ from those of}} Valentinus. Logos is created when Anthropos learns to speak.

40|$|A {{small number}} of very fragmentary sporangia {{containing}} <b>tetrads</b> are described using light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy {{as part of a}} study on diversity and disparity in Lower Devonian (Lochkovian) vegetation in the Welsh Borderland. The dispersed genus for permanent sculptured <b>tetrads,</b> Acontotetras, is recorded in two isolated discoidal sporangia, one of which has a similar sporangial wall construction to that in Cooksonia, the other with a non-cellular covering reminiscent of the recently described Lenticulatheca and Paracooksonia. Conversely, the dispersed spore genus for permanent, enveloped laevigate <b>tetrads,</b> Cheilotetras, is found within two sporangia with valvate construction. Another example of the latter contains unique sculptured monads. Further diversity is exemplified by spore masses containing <b>tetrads</b> belonging to Velatitetras and Cheilotetras, but some evidence of splitting in specimens of the latter genus led to discussion on the state of maturity of the in situ spores, and {{as to whether or not}} the dispersed palynomorphs would have been so as permanent <b>tetrads</b> or trilete monads. Such studies add to diversity, although a dearth of well-preserved specimens preclude erection of new taxa, and to disparity in local Early Devonian vegetation that was dominated by plants of very low stature...|$|R
40|$|By {{attaching}} basis vectors to {{the components}} of matter fields, one may render free action densities fully covariant. Both the connection and the <b>tetrads</b> are quadratic forms in these basis vectors. The metric of spacetime, which is quadratic in the <b>tetrads,</b> is then quartic in the basis vectors. ∗Submitted to the 1993 competition of the Gravity Research Foundation. ...|$|R
40|$|Prior to the mid-Silurian, {{evidence}} for the earliest embryophytes comes from dispersed spores, particularly permanent <b>tetrads,</b> there being no fossils showing gross morphology or anatomy of the producers. The fragmentary coalified mesofossils described here from the uppermost Silurian (Pridoli) and basal Devonian (Lochkovian) of the Welsh Borderland contain <b>tetrads</b> assigned to Tetrahedraletes, Velatitetras and Cheilotetras. These spores together with examples from spore masses have been examined by scanning and transmission electron microscopy and display diversity in ultrastructure of the exospore and envelope. <b>Tetrads</b> have been found, together with a putative elater, in the forking apex of an axial Lochkovian fossil, named Grisellatheca salopensis gen. et sp. nov., that anatomically, apart from spore characters, reveals no unequivocal {{evidence for}} hepatic affinity. The remaining fossils are equally as uninformative as regards affinity. <b>Tetrads</b> with ornamented envelopes are recorded in an isolated discoidal sporangium and in the bases of incomplete sporangia borne terminally on a bifurcating axis. Both ornament and ultrastructure suggest that the spores belong to quite distinct species within Velatitetras. Tetrahedraletes is recorded in an incomplete sporangium subtended by a forking axis, in which no cellular detail is preserved. Naked unfused <b>tetrads</b> also assigned to Tetrahedraletes are recorded in spore masses from both localities and again exospore ultrastructure demonstrates diversity. A final Lochkovian sporangium contains naked <b>tetrads</b> with sporadic Papiculate ornament and shows a unique trilayered exospore. Comparisons of exospore ultrastructure in these <b>tetrads,</b> which it is argued are mature and dispersed as such, provide no unequivocal evidence for affinities, be they tracheophyte or bryophyte. The bifurcating sporophytes are evidence against similarities with extant bryophytes. It is concluded that these very fragmentary fossils derive from small plants comprising relict populations of the vegetation that flourished on land in turfs through {{the greater part of}} the Ordovician and early Silurian, but that was gradually replaced by the tracheophytes...|$|R
25|$|D. radiodurans is {{a rather}} large, spherical bacterium, with a {{diameter}} of 1.5 to 3.5 µm. Four cells normally stick together, forming a <b>tetrad.</b> The bacteria are easily cultured and {{do not appear to}} cause disease. Colonies are smooth, convex, and pink to red in color. The cells stain Gram positive, although its cell envelope is unusual and is reminiscent of the cell walls of Gram negative bacteria.|$|E
25|$|The {{emerging}} shoots may be erect or nodding, with erect or pendulous flowers, {{which may}} become more erect as the plant matures. The flowers themselves, in common {{with other members of}} the Ericaceae, have corollas that are generally bell- or cup-shaped, though the petals themselves may or may not be fused. However, the Monotropoideae lack the poricidal anthers that are characteristic of the majority of the Ericaceae. (The Pyroleae do have poricidal anthers, however.) Pollen grains are released as a monad, in contrast to the majority of the Ericaceae, which release pollen grains in <b>tetrad</b> groups. (The Pyroleae variously release pollen as monads, tetrads, or polyads.) Fruits are dry loculicidal dehiscent (or sometimes indehiscent) capsule or a berry. Seeds are highly reduced dust seeds. The shoot may or may not be persistent after seed dispersal.|$|E

40|$|Rapid {{release of}} calcium from the sarcoplasmic {{reticulum}} (SR) of skeletal muscle fibers during excitation–contraction (e–c) coupling is {{initiated by the}} interaction of surface membrane calcium channels (dihydropyridine receptors; DHPRs) with the calcium release channels of the SR (ryanodine receptors; RyRs, or feet). We studied the early differentiation of calcium release units, which mediate this interaction, in BC 3 H 1 cells. Immunofluorescence labelings of differentiating myocytes with antibodies against α 1 and α 2 subunits of DHPRs, RyRs, and triadin show that the skeletal isoforms of all four proteins are abundantly expressed upon differentiation, they appear concomitantly, and they are colocalized. The transverse tubular system is poorly organized, and thus clusters of e–c coupling proteins are predominantly located at the cell periphery. Freeze fracture analysis of the surface membrane reveals <b>tetrads</b> of large intramembrane particles, arranged in orderly arrays. These appear concomitantly with arrays of feet (RyRs) and {{with the appearance of}} DHPR/RyS clusters, confirming that the four components of the <b>tetrads</b> correspond to skeletal muscle DHPRs. The arrangement of <b>tetrads</b> and feet in developing junctions indicates that incorporation of DHPRs in junctional domains of the surface membrane proceeds gradually and is highly coordinated with the formation of RyR arrays. Within the arrays, <b>tetrads</b> are positioned at a spacing of twice the distance between the feet. The incorporation of individual DHPRs into <b>tetrads</b> occurs exclusively at positions corresponding to alternate feet, suggesting that the assembly of RyR arrays not only guides the assembly of <b>tetrads</b> but also determines their characteristic spacing in the junction...|$|R
2500|$|A {{third term}} of The Global Village that McLuhan and Powers develop at length is The <b>Tetrad.</b> The <b>tetrad</b> is {{something}} like threads in a complexly interwoven flowing superspace, a four-fold pattern of transformation.
