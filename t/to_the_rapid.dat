50|$|Arguably <b>the</b> biggest {{attraction}} <b>to</b> Pony Pasture is <b>the</b> <b>rapids.</b> A class II, <b>the</b> <b>rapids</b> {{are part}} of the James River’s main channel. With the aid of park volunteers and funding from area recycling projects, easy access was made <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapids.</b> <b>The</b> Park System helped <b>to</b> create <b>the</b> access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapids</b> in order <b>to</b> ensure an easy place to raft, kayak, and canoe. The stairs that lead directly into the river are also fully equipped with a canoe launch, suitable for kayaks and rafts alike. Rafters will often start at Pony Pasture or even further up the James and venture until Belle Isle, one of Richmond’s main river entrances. Access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapids</b> is free, but rafting is prohibited if the water level is too high. Aside from Belle Isle, the majority of kayak, paddle, and raft trips that start at Pony Pasture typically end at Pipeline Rapids or Reedy Creek. <b>The</b> <b>rapids</b> are a very popular part of Pony Pasture and helped <b>to</b> establish <b>the</b> name “Pony Pasture Rapids”.|$|R

5|$|In 1970 the College of Arts and Sciences {{allowed the}} first women to enroll in its {{undergraduate}} programs, which effectively made the university coeducational.

5|$|Scouting in South Africa grew rapidly, and in 1912 Robert Baden-Powell visited South African Scouts.

5|$|About 1.2billion {{people in}} {{developing}} nations lack clean, safe water because most household and industrial wastes are dumped directly into rivers and lakes without treatment. This contributes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> increase in waterborne diseases in humans. Out of India's 3119 towns and cities, just 209 have partial treatment facilities, and only 8 have full wastewater treatment facilities (WHO 1992). 114 cities dump untreated sewage and partially cremated bodies directly into the Ganges River. Downstream, the untreated water is used for drinking, bathing, and washing. This situation is typical of many rivers in India {{as well as other}} developing countries.|$|E
5|$|Although {{opposite}} {{each other}} across the River Thames, Fulham on the north bank and Wandsworth on the south bank were historically isolated from each other; the nearest crossing points were at Putney Bridge to the west and Battersea Bridge to the east, both over a mile from Wandsworth. The fast flowing but narrow River Wandle at Wandsworth was well-situated for driving watermills, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> spread of industry in the area during the 19th century. Nearby Battersea Railway Bridge opened in 1863, but as the local population grew and London's built-up area began to encroach during the 19th century, pressure from local residents and businesses for a road bridge to be built increased.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, the talkies were a global phenomenon. In the United States, they helped secure Hollywood's {{position}} {{as one of}} the world's most powerful cultural/commercial centers of influence (see Cinema of the United States). In Europe (and, to a lesser degree, elsewhere), the new development was treated with suspicion by many filmmakers and critics, who worried that a focus on dialogue would subvert the unique aesthetic virtues of soundless cinema. In Japan, where the popular film tradition integrated silent movie and live vocal performance, talking pictures were slow to take root. In India, sound was the transformative element that led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> expansion of the nation's film industry.|$|E
5|$|Despite England {{going into}} the series as the favourites, West Indies won the series 1–0 after winning the first match at Sabina Park. The {{remaining}} matches all ended in draws. The series was originally intended as a four Test series; however the abandonment of the Second Test due to {{the conditions of the}} field at the SVR Stadium in Antigua led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> inclusion of an additional game staged at the Antigua Recreation Ground, resulting in a five, rather than four match Test series.|$|E
5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> pace of operations, deployment, and redeployment, {{coordination}} of artillery units and their fires became a worrisome quandary during the operations. This was {{made even more}} problematic by the confusion generated {{by the lack of}} adequate communications systems between the rapidly advancing units. The joint nature of the operation added another level of complexity to the already overstretched communications network. Regardless, due to the ability of U.S. logisticians to innovate and improvise, supplies of food, water, ammunition, and spare parts arrived at their destinations without any shortages hampering combat operations and the communications system, although complicated, functioned well enough during the short duration of U.S. operations.|$|E

5|$|During the Victorian {{expansion}} of Manchester, Didsbury {{developed as a}} prosperous settlement; a few mansions from the period still exist on Wilmslow Road between Didsbury village and Parrs Wood {{to the east and}} Withington to the north, but they have now been converted to nursing homes and offices. The opening of the Midland Railway line in 1880 contributed greatly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> growth in the population of Didsbury, with stations at Didsbury and Withington and West Didsbury offering easy rail connections to Manchester Central. The line closed in 1967, although Didsbury station building remained standing until its demolition in the 1980s. The station clock and water fountain have survived, dedicated to local doctor and campaigner for the poor, Dr. J. Milson Rhodes.|$|E
5|$|Early on September9, Luis turned {{towards the}} north and {{weakened}} to a Category2 hurricane, with winds of 110mph (165km/h). Several hours later, the hurricane made its closest approach to Bermuda, passing about 200mi (320km) west of the island. Later that day, the storm began to accelerate as it traveled northeast ahead of a strong trough located to the northwest of Luis. During the afternoon of September10, Hurricane Luis began to undergo an extratropical transition as it rapidly approached the Canadian coastline. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> movement of the storm, significant weakening did not occur until Luis was at an unusually high latitude.|$|E
5|$|Following the Norman {{conquest of}} England, Sheffield Castle {{was built to}} control the Saxon {{settlements}} and Sheffield developed into a small town, no larger than Sheffield City Centre. By the 14th century Sheffield was noted {{for the production of}} knives, and by 1600, overseen by the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire, it had become the second centre of cutlery production in England after London. In the 1740s the crucible steel process was improved by Sheffield resident Benjamin Huntsman, allowing a much better production quality. At about the same time, Sheffield plate, a form of silver plating, was invented. The associated industries led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> growth of Sheffield; the town was incorporated as a borough in 1843 and granted a city charter in 1893.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Pacific War in December 1941, the school's Wirraways were classified as Second Line (Reserve) aircraft in the defence of Australia, while the base was fortified with sandbags, trenches, and gun pits. On 1January 1942, No.60 Squadron was established at Forest Hill from No.2 SFTS aircraft and personnel. Equipped with 18 Wirraways, the unit formed part of the expansion of the Australian military in response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> Japanese advance in the first month of the Pacific War.

5|$|In late 1998, 120–130 tammar {{wallabies}} {{died suddenly}} in research facilities and zoos in New South Wales and Queensland, perishing less than twelve hours after exhibiting the first symptoms, with most exhibiting no symptoms at all. Post mortem examination revealed haemorrhage of muscle, and abdominal and thoracic organs. The syndrome {{is known as}} tammar sudden death syndrome and the pathogen is an orbivirus of the family Reoviridae. It does not occur south of Sydney. Captive populations of tammar wallabies in New South Wales have subsequently suffered infections in summer months. No treatment has been attempted due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> progression of the disease.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{military}} potential of pigeon photography for aerial reconnaissance appeared attractive. Battlefield tests in World War I provided encouraging results, but the ancillary technology of mobile dovecotes for messenger pigeons {{had the greatest}} impact. Owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> perfection of aviation during the war, military interest in pigeon photography faded and Neubronner abandoned his experiments. The idea was briefly resurrected in the 1930s by a Swiss clockmaker, and reportedly also by the German and French militaries. Although war pigeons were deployed extensively during World War II, it is unclear to what extent, if any, birds were involved in aerial reconnaissance. The United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) later developed a battery-powered camera designed for espionage pigeon photography; details of its use remain classified.|$|E
