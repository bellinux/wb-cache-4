40|$|The WTO Dispute Settlement System (DSS) {{has often}} been cited as {{especially}} important for smaller or poorer developing countries that traditionally lack political or economic power to pursue their interests in a power-based system. In practice, however, the WTO DSS has predominantly been used by developed WTO members, such as the United States (US) and the European Union (EU). There {{are only a few}} proactive developing country users of the system, typically more advanced economies such as Brazil and China. Pakistan, a weak economy, and one of the WTO’s original developing country members, fits this general pattern, with limited participation in the WTO DSS. As this thesis explains, Pakistan’s modest use of the WTO DSS can be attributed not only to its small proportion of global trade but, more significantly, to its limited <b>trade</b> <b>capacity</b> to pursue cases in the WTO DSS. These <b>trade</b> <b>capacity</b> limitations include inadequate institutional, informational, human, financial and legal resources, which are needed to litigate effectively in the WTO DSS. Current WTO institutional support is limited to address the <b>trade</b> <b>capacity</b> issues of countries like Pakistan, and reform of the WTO DSS seems far-fetched. Pakistan, thus, has to enhance its <b>trade</b> <b>capacity</b> resources independently within existing constraints, in order to make better use of the current WTO DSS. Public–Private Partnerships (PPPs), or government–business resource sharing, have been cited as a factor in the US, the EU and Brazil’s enhancing of their <b>trade</b> <b>capacity</b> and success in WTO litigation. Developing countries such as Pakistan, on the other hand, have made only limited use of PPPs. The academic literature examining in detail their use of PPPs is also fairly sparse. This thesis, therefore, examines PPPs as a means of addressing Pakistan’s <b>trade</b> <b>capacity</b> issues. The thesis identifies the significance of PPPs for Pakistan in WTO litigation, and examines Pakistan’s current arrangements and potential barriers to the formation of effective PPPs. Most importantly, it explains how a poor economy like Pakistan can adopt PPPs successfully fitting in its unique needs and circumstances, and concludes that PPPs show great potential for other developing counties in similar situations...|$|R

50|$|European traders {{first became}} {{a force in}} {{the region in the}} 15th century, with the 1445 {{establishment}} of a Portuguese trading post at Arguin Island, off the coast of present-day Senegal; by 1475, Portuguese traders had reached as far as the Bight of Benin. The transatlantic African slave trade began almost immediately after based on the already well established slave <b>trading</b> <b>capacity</b> serving the Islamic world, with the Portuguese taking hundreds of captives back to their country for use as slaves; however, it would not begin on a grand scale until Christopher Columbus's voyage to the Americas and the subsequent demand for cheap colonial labour. In 1510, the Spanish crown legalised the African slave trade, followed by the English in 1562. By 1650 the slave trade was in full force at a number of sites along the coast of West Africa, and over the coming centuries would result in severely reduced growth for the region's population and economy. The expanding Atlantic slave trade produced significant populations of West Africans living in the New World, recently colonised by Europeans. The oldest known remains of African slaves in the Americas were found in Mexico in early 2006; they are thought to date from the late 16th century and the mid-17th century.|$|E
40|$|This Master Thesis proposes an {{analytical}} model of commodity trading {{in the presence}} of market power, which is new to the literature.

This policy determines, given a realization of the current price spread between the two markets, how much (if any) volume must be bought/sold from/at the first market and sold/bought at/from the second market, so that the long-run average profit is maximized. When optimizing, the trader takes into account its impact on future spreads. We then describe the parameters of the optimal policy and we apply our model to kerosene prices in New York and Los Angeles, and illustrate the insights derived...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{signal-to-noise}} ratio (SNR) gain {{is used to}} resolve the limits of circuit chip area and power consumption in multiple antenna systems. Multiple antennas promise greatly increased capacity, but increase chip area and power consumption due to multiple RF front ends and additional resources to process multiple streams. However, <b>trading</b> <b>capacity</b> for diversity gain decreases the SNR required for similar data rates as a single antenna system. For analog circuits, the SNR gain relaxes noise requirements, making viable both inductorless and reduced power consumption circuits. For example, simulations of a inductorless low noise amplifier (LNA) show a 3 dB increase in noise figure but threefold decrease in area when compared with a conventional narrowband LNA. Similarly, a narrowband LNA has a slightly higher noise figure when operated at half its original power consumption. For digital circuits, the lowered complexity of high diversity systems decreases the size and power consumption of the digital processor. I...|$|E

Two institutions, the continuous double auction and the single call market, are commonly employed on organized exchanges.

The laboratory environment features four buyers and four sellers who receive random values and costs in each period and who have a one-unit <b>trading</b> <b>capacity.</b> Therefore, each period provides an observation of price formation and exchange in a thin market environment. We find that trading efficiency is lowest in the institutions that permit only one transaction opportunity each period, primarily due to insufficient trading volume. However, the institutions that permit a single trading opportunity force all traders to transact at a uniform price, which tends to generate prices that more accurately reflect underlying market conditions. *This is a revision of a draft presented at “Money, Markets and Methods: A Conference in Hono...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a market design for <b>trading</b> <b>capacity</b> {{reserves}} (also called Ancillary Services, AS) and to introduce a strategy for the optimal bidding problem in such a scenario. In the deregulated market, the presence of several market participants or Balance Responsible Parties (BRPs) entitled for trading energy, together with the increasing integration of renewable sources and price-elastic loads, shift the focus on decentralized control and reliable forecast techniques. The main feature of the considered market design is its double-sided nature. In addition to portfolio-based supply bids and based on prediction of their stochastic production and load, BRPs are allowed to submit risk-limiting requests. Requesting capacity from the AS market corresponds to giving to the market an estimate of the possible deviation from the daily production schedule resulting from the day-ahead auction and from bilateral contracts, named E-Program. In this way each BRP is responsible for the balanced and safe operation of the electric grid. On the other hand, at each Program Time Unit (PTU) BRPs must also offer their available capacity under the form of bids. In this paper, a bidding strategy to the double-sided market is described, where the risk is minimized and all the constraints are fulfilled. The algorithms devised are tested in a simulation environment and compared to the current practice, where the double-sided auction is not contemplated. Results in terms of expected imbalances and reliability are presented...|$|E

40|$|In {{my paper}} “Rumors ” (van Bommel, 2003), I show {{how it can}} be optimal, for a {{resource}} constraint informed investor, to spread informative but imprecise rumors. The rumor strategy leads to excessive volatility and the potential overshooting of the market price may give the rumormonger the opportunity to pro…t twice from her informational advantage. In the model, a protagonist, L, privately knows the liquidation value ~v 2 [2; 2] of a security that is traded in a series of N Kyle (1985) auctions by uninformed traders who demand ~ui N(0; u) in every auction i. L’s <b>trading</b> <b>capacity</b> is limited to xL u, which essentially means that L is too small to steer the price to its liquidation value using the Kyle (1985) rationing program. In the suggested rumor strategy L buys (sells) xL whenever she sees ~v> 0 (~v < 0), and that she immediately afterwards sends a “buy ” (“sell”) rumor to her followers who, in aggregate can move the price. Because this rumor is imprecise but correct, the followers will eventually steer the price to either 1, or 1. In those cases where L privately knows 0 < ~v < 1 or 1 < ~v < 0, there is thus overshooting. It is this overshooting that L can exploit, by ‡ipping her position. The analysis is kept simple thanks to the assumption that L always trades her entire endowment in the …rst Kyle-auction.

40|$|Infrastructure and {{institutional}} settings for international trade {{play a key}} role in the efficient exchange of merchandise goods across borders. Once final goods depart the producer warehouse, a number of legal procedures associated with customs and security need to be completed at the facilities and service centers located at the borders before the goods can be loaded onto ships for exports. Quantitative measures suggest that ‘trade facilitation’ varies largely across countries; high income economies have state-of-the-art technologies and infrastructures, while developing regions lag far behind with regards to logistics. The goal of this thesis is to explore the extent to which <b>trading</b> <b>capacity</b> inflates transaction costs and reduces competitiveness of goods in international markets with a focus on trade estimations and macroeconomic impacts that are relevant to policy. ^ The first essay establishes the causal effect of trade facilitation on bilateral trade flows within a simultaneous framework using data obtained from 109 countries. A partial equilibrium microeconomic model of trade is derived to underpin the bidirectional relationship between investment incentives and trade volumes. The elasticity of trade with respect to reforms is estimated to be positive and larger than that obtained using the single-equation 2 ̆ 7 s model. The second essay model trade-related capital investments within a general equilibrium framework that extends the scope of the existing literature by fully integrating costs of reforms. The newly-developed model is then applied to estimate the net benefits of infrastructural reforms in Sub-Saharan Africa. Empirical predictions suggest that net benefits from reforms are substantial. However, the opportunity costs of capital investments in terms of foregone present consumptions are steep. The results provide a new perspective on the behavior of persistent under-investments in many developing countries where short run costs are large. The last essay explores prospects of greater regional integration in South Asia from trade facilitation efforts in the region. Impacts on trade, welfare and poverty are substantially positive, that are being used to leverage development efforts at the Asian Development Bank (ADB). ...|$|E
40|$|Valdivia is a Chilean city {{located near}} an estuary system, 800 km south of Santiago. The {{navigation}} {{capacity of the}} Valdivia river mainly determines the present state and future possibilities {{for the welfare of}} the city. Since sedimentation problems arose in the river, the capacity for navigation became limited. The ministry of Valdivia therefore desires a solution for this problem in order to create possibilities for future growth. However, it is not known to what extent solutions for the sedimentation problem will actually contribute to an increase of welfare. By identifying the problem for the Ministry of Public Works of Chile, the boundaries and goal of the project could be set. In this research an attempt is made to answer the following research question: How can the surplus of sediment in the Valdivia river be remedied and to what extent will this contribute to the economic and social values of the city of Valdivia? In order to know how to remedy the surplus of sediment, a qualitative analysis of probable causes of the sedimentation was necessary. The main subjects which were researched by means of data and literature are tidal influence, river discharges, sediment composition and salt intrusion. With this knowledge it was concluded that the directions and magnitudes of flow lines in the river system can give good indications on what locations sedimentation can occur. The interaction between tidal currents and river discharges are the main drivers behind these flow characteristics. To verify the theoretical analysis, a basic Delft 3 D model was set up containing only tidal movement and river discharges. The pattern of the flow lines which was obtained from the Delft 3 D model supports the possibility that sedimentation occurs on the current identified sedimentation locations. Although other hydrological and morphological processes were found to possibly influence sedimentation rates in the river, qualitative data for studying these processes were missing. The current Delft 3 D model is therefore a good result regarding the available data and {{can be seen as a}} part of preliminary research in order to support further studies. Because the exact causes of the sedimentation were not identified in this research, it was not possible to come up with suitable solutions and to research how these solutions could affect the system. However, in order to gain insight in the effects of a river system without sedimentation problems, a fictitious scenario was studied by means of a social cost benefit analysis. The goal of the social costs and benefits analysis was to give insight in what factors should be taken into account when considering a project plan which solves the sedimentation problem. A dredging design was made in order to make the Valdivia river navigable for larger cargo vessels to increase the <b>trading</b> <b>capacity</b> of Valdivia. This dredging design comprises the deepening of the Valdivia river to a minimum water depth of 10 meters. Considering investment and maintenance costs of the dredging activities of this magnitude, it is concluded that the costs are not profitable compared to the social and economic effects of a higher traffic intensity on the river. With the social costs and benefits analysis all effects of solving the sedimentation problem are inventoried. When the Delft 3 D model can identify what the remedy of the sedimentation could be, the impact on the economic and social values of Valdivia can be determined. This research was not sufficient to answer the research question. Both the Delft 3 D model and the SCBA model were lacking accurate and reliable data. To expand this research, it is necessary to collect the data of which an overview has been made. Therefore, this research can serve as a preliminary study for further research. It is recommended that after data collection, solutions will be identified which can solve the sedimentation problem. These solutions need to be compared with a scenario analysis in order to decide on which is the most suitable solution for the sedimentation problem. Besides this, it is advised to research whether it is actually necessary to expand the river for transport when looking at all actors involved. Multidisciplinary Projec...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{major policy}} {{issues related to}} commodity dependence and export diversification in low-income countries. Contrary to some widely-held view, it argues that natural resources are not necessarily a ‘curse’ that condemns low-income countries to underdevelopment but can {{provide a basis for}} sustained export-led growth. Natural resource-based sectors have potential for export diversification. The OECD ‘mirror’ trade data indeed suggest that many different routes to diversification exist, including resource-based manufacturing and processing of primary products. However, these opportunities are far from being exploited in many low-income countries. This is because export diversification is typically a slow process, and this process needs to be sustained by an appropriate and coherent strategy, characterised by a combination of vision, co-ordination and management of conflicting interests. Moreover, the analysis of trade support services in two African countries points to a mismatch between private sector’s needs and services actually provided and to a limited institutional development of the trade and investment support network. The lessons for <b>trade</b> <b>capacity</b> building are important for Africa but are also relevant for other low-income countries. export diversification, resource curse, Doha development agenda, <b>trade</b> <b>capacity</b> building, <b>trade</b> support services...|$|R
