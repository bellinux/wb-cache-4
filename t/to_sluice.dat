500|$|The select {{committee}} report concluded the bar would return through re-silting {{if it were}} dredged, and there were insufficient resources to prevent it. Several alternatives were discussed, including the construction of two guide walls <b>to</b> <b>sluice</b> water across the bar, thereby removing it. Evidence was given that the bar {{was made up of}} [...] "hard sand" [...] which would prove difficult to remove. During the discussions, it was indicated that whilst the sandbank could be removed by a variety of methods, it would not significantly improve access to the harbour, and that a harbour of refuge would be better on the Welsh coast.|$|E
500|$|In the summer, {{water would}} be used <b>to</b> <b>sluice</b> and pan the dirt, {{separating}} out the heavier gold from gravel. This required miners to construct sluices, which were sequences of wooden boxes [...] long, through which the dirt would be washed; up to 20 of these might be needed for each mining operation. The sluices in turn required lots of water, usually produced by creating a dam and ditches or crude pipes. [...] "Bench gold" [...] mining on the hill sides could not use sluice lines because water could not be pumped that high up. Instead, these mines used rockers, boxes that moved {{back and forth like}} a cradle, to create the motion needed for separation. Finally, the resulting gold dust could be exported out of the Klondike; exchanged for paper money at the rate of $16 ($430) per troy ounce (ozt) through one of the major banks that opened in Dawson City, or simply used as money when dealing with local traders.|$|E

5|$|When repairs <b>to</b> Craven <b>Sluices</b> were {{necessary}} in 1684, {{the water was}} temporarily diverted into Scots Float Channel. This worked well, and a regulating penn was built, so that water could be routed <b>to</b> Craven <b>Sluices</b> or Scots Float. Knock Sluice was built below the Appledore Sluice in 1686, and land above it was reclaimed. In 1696, New Knock Sluice was built, close <b>to</b> Craven <b>Sluices,</b> and the sea was finally excluded from the Wittersham Levels.|$|R
2500|$|Embanking the River Hull, and {{carrying}} water {{away from the}} carrs in a lower level channel was suggested by several engineers, but there was opposition to making the scheme really efficient. Some came from the Holderness Drainage, who insisted that any embankments must ensure that land {{to the west of}} the river flooded before their own area was threatened, while an outfall to the Humber was resisted by the Port of Hull, who wanted the water to enter the river <b>to</b> <b>sluice</b> silt from its mouth, known as the Old Harbour. The Beverley and Barmston Drainage Act was finally obtained in 1798, and work began. Water from the north east of the region was diverted to a new sea outfall at Barmston, and [...] of drainage cuts were constructed, the main channel running broadly parallel to the river, but following a straighter course.|$|E
60|$|The hatchways, however, {{were now}} removed, and all below ordered on deck, and after awhile a party was told off <b>to</b> <b>sluice</b> down their {{quarters}} below.

50|$|Water {{levels in}} the canal were {{controlled}} by a sluice or staunch near {{the point at which}} the River Bain joined the River Waring. A new cut, called the South Ings Drain, which ran from below the <b>sluice</b> <b>to</b> join the old course of the River Bain near Thornton, was made under the terms of the Horncastle Enclosure Award in 1805. A cottage was erected next <b>to</b> the <b>sluice</b> <b>to</b> house the Staunchkeeper, as adjustment of the sluice was vital in times of drought or flood.|$|R

50|$|In 1939, the Great Northern Paper Company impounded Fifth St. John Pond in T.6 R.17 and dug a 2 mi canal {{from the}} pond {{allowing}} {{the diversion of}} water from the Saint John River's Baker Branch into the Penobscot's North Branch, <b>to</b> <b>sluice</b> wood to the company mill at Millinocket. Yellow perch also used the canal to spread into the upper Penobscot River drainage.|$|E
3000|$|... (2) The {{seasonal}} fluctuation of water quality {{is closely related}} to the water temperature and discharge. Water temperature generally shows negative association with water quality variables, while river discharge exerts distinct influence on water quality among tributaries due to the spatially varying composition of pollutant load. In addition, seasonal change in spatial dependence of water variables is detected, which could be attributed <b>to</b> <b>sluices</b> and dams regulation and rainfall-runoff pollution.|$|R

50|$|Leesburg was {{established}} after gold was discovered at the Leesburg Mine on July 16, 1866. The mining town {{was named for}} General Robert E.

Miners dug over 400 miles of ditches to carry water <b>to</b> <b>sluice</b> out gold. By 1930 placer mining was carried on nearly entirely by hydraulic methods. The mine produced nearly $16,000,000 in gold prior to 1938.|$|E
50|$|Some of the river's rapids are class IV or even V, {{making this}} one of the roughest rivers in the area, which attracts many {{whitewater}} rafters. Until 1971 the West Branch was the main thoroughfare for the Great Northern Paper Company <b>to</b> <b>sluice</b> its logs to its mill in Millinocket, Maine. In 1971 Great Northern opened the Golden Road (Maine) for transporting the logs. The road parallels the river.

50|$|In Roman metallurgy, {{new methods}} for extracting gold {{on a large}} scale were {{developed}} by introducing hydraulic mining methods, especially in Hispania from 25 BC onwards and in Dacia from 106 AD onwards. One of their largest mines was at Las Medulas in León, where seven long aqueducts enabled them <b>to</b> <b>sluice</b> most of a large alluvial deposit. The mines at Roşia Montană in Transylvania were also very large, and until very recently, still mined by opencast methods. They also exploited smaller deposits in Britain, such as placer and hard-rock deposits at Dolaucothi. The various methods they used are well described by Pliny the Elder in his encyclopedia Naturalis Historia written {{towards the end of the}} first century AD.|$|E

40|$|The general goal of {{this paper}} is to explore the {{properties}} of sluicing (IP-ellipsis) in Russian and to see how the Russian data shed light on the general processes underlying the phenomenon of sluicing. The first issue we will address is what positions wh-remnants occupy in sluicing constructions in Russian, considering the properties of wh-movement in Russian. We will then turn <b>to</b> <b>sluicing</b> with multiple wh-remnants, which I will refer <b>to</b> as multiple <b>sluicing,</b> following Takahashi (1994). Here we will investigate how the interpretative properties of multiple interrogatives in Russian affect the multiple sluicing possibilities in this language. Finally, I will present the data showing that superiority effects emerge under sluicing in Russian. This is unexpected, given that Russian does not exhibit superiority effects in corresponding non-elliptical interrogatives. In addressing the question of what causes superiority effects under sluicing, I will propose an analysis which makes use of an independent property of ellipsis, namely, quantifier parallelism...|$|R

40|$|A {{concept for}} a mining method {{developed}} {{for a series}} of thin soft sloping seams between competent roof and floor strata is presented. The method proposed has the form of a retreating longwall where the mining method is by hydraulic sluicing.

The directional drilling assembly is then removed from the drill-string and replaced by a jetting bit which is used <b>to</b> <b>sluice</b> the coal from between the borehole and the goaf.
