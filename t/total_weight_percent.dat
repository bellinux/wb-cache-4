The degree of healing was determined by the fracture toughness before and after ''healing'' using double-cantilever beam analysis.

Care {{was taken to}} maintain constant all variables known to affect rolling-element fatigue life. The longest lives at 150 F were obtained with AISI 52100. Ten-percent lives of the other materials ranged from 7 to 78 percent of that obtained with 52100. A trend is indicated toward decreased rolling-element fatigue life with increased <b>total</b> <b>weight</b> <b>percent</b> of alloying elements. Three groups of 120 -mm bore ball bearings made from AISI M- 1, AISI M- 50, and WB- 49 were fatigue tested at an outer-race temperature of 600 F. The 10 -percent lives of the M- 50 and M- 1 bearings exceeded the calculated AFBMA life by factors of 13 and 6, respectively. The bearings with WB- 49 races showed lives less than AFBMA life.

40|$|Abstract: An initial {{investigation}} into the inclusion of high protein distillers dried grain with solubles (HPDDG) in juvenile rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss diets was conducted during a 36 -day feeding trial. Four experimental diets containing either 10 % or 20 % HPDDG with supplemental amino acids, and either with or without phytase, were compared to a fish-meal-based, non-HPDDG, diet. There {{was no significant difference}} among any of the diets in <b>total</b> <b>weight</b> gain, <b>percent</b> <b>weight</b> gain, feed conversion ratio, or percent mortality. There was also no significant difference in length, weight, condition factor, hepatosomatic index, viscerosomatic index, or any fish health parameter in fishes fed any of the diets. Fillet composition, as determined by crude protein, crude lipid, water, and ash were also not significantly different from fish reared on any of the diets. Estimated protein digestibility coefficients were significantly less in the fish receiving the diet void of HPDDG compared to any of the other diets. The addition of phytase had no effect on any rearing parameters. The results suggest that HPDDG, if supplemented with essential amino acids, may be included at concentrations of at least 20 % (dry weight) in rainbow trout diets and that more detailed {{investigation into}} the use of HPDDG is warranted...|$|R

One hundred and forty-four lactating sows - 46 of first and second farrowing (experiment I) and 98 from the third to eighth farrowing (experiment II) - were used. Sows were distributed in experimental design of randomized blocks consisting of two rooms (with air cooling and control), with the sow as the experimental unit. The average duration of lactation was 21 days. Sows were fed ad libitum with the same lactation diet. In experiment I, the air cooling increased the daily feed intake, reduced the <b>total</b> and <b>percent</b> <b>weight</b> loss, increased the weight of the piglets and litters at weaning and improved the daily milk production of sows.

The incorporation of PLA-b-PEG block copolymers not only decreased fiber diameters but also dramatically increased the amount of biotin available at the fiber surface able to bind avidin.

This model is equipped with an Ag anode X-ray tube and a Geometrically Optimized Large area Drift Detector (GOLDD).

The samples were directly positioned on the analysis window of the Niton XL 3 portable test stand due to the small size of the samples. Analyses were carried out using the fundamental parameters calibration that is employed in Mining Cu/Zn modes. Four available elemental ranges, namely main, low, high and light with measurement duration of 100  s each, were applied to detect any trace of 36 elements from Mg to U.
