As the rod vibrates the spot is seen to describe complicated figures in <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> spark whirled about in the darkness. His photometer was probably suggested by this appliance. It enables two lights to be compared by the relative brightness of their reflections in a silvered bead, which describes a narrow ellipse, so as to draw the spots into parallel lines.|$|E

The towering monument, made of marble, granite, and bluestone gneiss, it is both the world's tallest stone structure and the world's tallest obelisk, standing [...] according to the National Park Service. Construction of the monument began in 1848, was halted from 1854 to 1877, and was completed in 1884. In a Journal review, dated 17 October 1911, Arnold Bennett said of the monument, [...] "Saw Washington monument. Phallic. Appalling. A national catastrophe – only equalled by the Albert Memorial. Tiny doll-like people waiting to go into it." [...] Dan Burstein says of it, [...] "Speaking of sex symbols, there is no more phallic symbol in existence than the Washington Monument, and the Capitol dome can be viewed as breastlike." [...] James Webb used a metaphor to praise the [...] "uplift" [...] power of the Washington Monument as a white phallus, [...] "piercing <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bayonet". In the futuristic film Hardwired, set in the United States where everything noteworthy is commercialized, the Washington Monument is used as a giant Trojan condoms billboard.|$|E

2500|$|In late 1964, Page was {{approached}} {{about the possibility}} of replacing Eric Clapton in the Yardbirds, but he declined out of loyalty to his friend. In February 1965, Clapton quit the Yardbirds and Page was formally offered his spot, but unwilling to give up his lucrative career as a session musician and worried about his health under touring conditions, he suggested his friend Jeff Beck. On 16 May 1966, drummer Keith Moon, bass player John Paul Jones, keyboardist Nicky Hopkins, Beck and Page recorded [...] "Beck's Bolero" [...] in London's IBC Studios. The experience gave Page an idea to form a new supergroup featuring Beck, along with The Who's John Entwistle on bass and Moon on drums. However, the lack of a quality vocalist and contractual problems prevented the project from getting off the ground. During this time, Moon suggested the name [...] "Lead Zeppelin" [...] for the first time, after Entwistle commented that the proceedings would take to <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lead balloon.|$|E

This energy also manifests itself as an impenetrable and virtually indestructible [...] "blast field" [...] that protects him from bodily harm. He can use this blast-field for the following effects: to function as a personal shield or extending it to encompass others, to shape the field around another person to imprison them, or to absorb outside kinetic impact into his own energy supply, enabling him to increase the bludgeoning power of his blows or to create explosive shock waves upon impact.|$|E

50|$|Birdman from Baratoga was an {{adventure}} strip {{about a boy}} {{who grew up on}} a Pacific island with only the company of birds, and learned from them the secret of flight. By the use of a feather cape, he was able to glide through <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> albatros. When an English sailor is castaway on the island, called Baratoga, they escape together on a raft and set out on a series of adventures in the Pacific, beginning by hunting down the desperado who has stolen the man's pearl-fishing yacht, Enterprise. Birdman from Baratoga was perhaps loosely based on a humour strip which had run in Buster during 1968: Captain Swoop - He's Half Man, Half Bird, Half Wit.|$|R
2500|$|The {{opening track}} of Homogenic, [...] "Hunter" [...] showcases the hybrid {{elements}} of strings and electronic backing beats through the album. It blends the live {{sound of the}} Icelandic String Octet —orchestrated by Eumir Deodato—, Yasuhiro Kobayashi's accordion and [...] "stuttering computer beats and beeps" [...] programmed by Mark Bell. Music journalist Evelyn McDonnell wrote [...] "the production showed Björk's steeping in {{the cutting edge of}} electronic dance-music culture, her embrace of techno futurism, her time spent pulling all-nighters in London clubs. But the emotion was ancient, deeply human." [...] The song has been described as [...] "dark", [...] "uncompromising [...] " [...] and [...] "icy". According to Ray Gun, [...] "Hunter" [...] evokes an eerie terrain with rolling techno beats and strings penetrating <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> toxic fog. Björk's vocals have been much celebrated in the track. They have been described as what [...] " [...] the whole shebang together together : full of reverberating menace and trepidation on the verses, then bursting into full-throated confession, layers of her voice pitching next to each other then cascading together." [...] The Wire wrote Björk's voice [...] "oscillates between steely-edged determination and uncontained freedom.|$|E
2500|$|Magnani {{worked with}} Tennessee Williams {{again for the}} 1960 film, The Fugitive Kind (originally titled, Orpheus Descending) {{directed}} by Sidney Lumet, in which she played Lady Torrance and starred with Marlon Brando. The original screenplay Orpheus Descending was another play inspired by Magnani, although she similarly did not feature in the Broadway play. In the film she played a woman [...] "hardened by life's cruelties and a grief that will not fade." [...] It also co-starred a young Joanne Woodward {{in one of her}} early roles. In an article he wrote for Life magazine Williams discussed why he chose her for the part:"Anna and I had both cherished the dream that her appearance in the part I created for her in The Fugitive Kind would be her greatest triumph to date... She is simply a rare being who seems to have about her a little lightning-shot cloud all her own.... In a crowded room she can sit perfectly motionless and silent and still you feel the atmospheric tension of her presence, its quiver and hum in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> live wire exposed, and a mood of Anna's is like the presence of royalty." ...|$|E
2500|$|Development of {{the film}} that would {{come to be called}} Zootopia began when Byron Howard pitched six story ideas to Disney Animation chief {{creative}} officer and executive producer John Lasseter, of which three involved animal characters: an all-animal adaptation of The Three Musketeers, a 1960s-themed story about a [...] "mad doctor cat...who turned children into animals," [...] and a [...] "bounty hunter pug in space." [...] The common thread running through these ideas was that Howard wanted to do a film similar to Disney’s Robin Hood, which also featured animals in anthropomorphic roles. [...] According to Howard, Zootopia emerged from his desire to create something different from other animal anthropomorphic films, where animals either live in the natural world or in the human world. His concept, in which animals live in a modern world designed by animals for animals, was well received by Lasseter, who responded by embracing and lifting Howard [...] "in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> baby Simba." [...] Lasseter suggested that Howard should try combining the 1960s theme with the animal characters, especially the space pug. This led Howard to develop and pitch Savage Seas, an international spy film centered on a rabbit named [...] "Jack Savage" [...] who was somewhat like James Bond. It was around this time that screenwriter Jared Bush was hired to work on the film; he was excited to work on a spy film because his own father and grandfather had worked for the Central Intelligence Agency.|$|E

2500|$|When Entity FX {{took over}} the duties of {{creating}} the digital effects for the series, they also {{took over the}} challenge of crafting effects that would illustrate Clark’s super-powered abilities, including the new [...] "heat vision" [...] that was introduced this season. The visual effects for heat vision evolved {{over the course of}} the first season, until Gough and Millar agreed on one that reflected their image of what heat vision should look like; they did not want the usual [...] "red beams" [...] or [...] "laser vision". The visuals developed from the idea that they wanted Clark to be able to use it in front of people without them being able to see it. What emerged was a [...] "heat ripple" [...] from [...] "distorting the frame". John Wash explains what the creators were looking for:" [...] wanted to be fairly accurate in terms of what you might see from something that was searingly hot traveling through <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> disturbance of the atmosphere. We keyed our research off the little ripples that you see if a light goes past a hotplate and reflects on a wall. We used a computer to create a conical version of that effect that could emanate from Clark's eyes, in combination with a little effect." [...] They used [...] "blobs of heat vision" [...] instead of [...] "constant rays" [...] for the first instances of Clark using his ability, in an effort to simulate Clark's attempts to control it. A couple of episodes later in [...] "Red", the special effects team would use similar techniques for red kryptonite. To illustrate red kryptonite’s effect on Clark, and it releasing his inhibitions, the special effects team crafted digital effects in his eyes. Brian Harding tweaked the effects they were already using for Clark’s heat vision, giving them a [...] "little devilish, hellish red flicker" [...] in Clark’s iris. To help illustrate Clark’s super speed, Mat Beck and his team would slow down and speed up background settings in a single shot. For example, in [...] "Ryan", when Clark speeds up to the camera everything else slows to a stop—leaves stop blowing and birds are frozen in mid-flight—then everything begins moving normally as Clark races away from the camera. Entity FX also adds a blurring effect to Clark's body, as well as a distortion to the background to help further illustrate the speed at which Clark travels.|$|E
