5|$|And by the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> it all {{organized}} and figured out, there were really {{only a couple}} of songs left for me to do anything on. So I came into L.A. {{for a couple of days}} and Kasim... came in, as was the routine, and we did maybe three songs... just so that I’d have a few fingerprints on the record. I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|E
25|$|The 1978 Welsh {{had arrived}} in Australia as (the then) Five Nations Champions, Triple Crown winners, the best rugby union team {{in the world but}} they were a sad and sorry bunch by the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> to Sydney for the last game of the tour, the second test. The team was {{decimated}} by injuries and in two earlier tour games had suffered a last minute loss to Sydney and a humiliating defeat midweek to the Australian Capital Territory.|$|E
25|$|On New Year's Day in 1912, and the {{following}} weeks, Nerman {{and some of his}} Swedish friends went to Germany to follow Karl Liebknecht during his election campaign. Nerman had met Liebknecht briefly a couple of years earlier on a socialist gathering in Stockholm, but this <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> to know each other well. In his autobiography, Nerman writes that he was surprised and impressed to learn that Liebknecht could speak almost fluent Swedish and liked to sing songs by Bellman.|$|E

25|$|The Roman family which Arthur rescues lives {{north of}} Hadrian's Wall. This mission would be {{unlikely}} because the Wall represented the extent of Roman rule in Britain, except for brief periods of occupation during the 2nd century AD during which <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> {{as far north as}} Falkirk in the Central Lowlands of Scotland, where pieces of the Antonine Wall are still visible; particularly in Callendar Park. Romanized client states such as that of the Votadini did exist north of the wall even into the Sub-Roman era.|$|E
25|$|By the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> to the beach, Kalaniʻōpuʻu's two {{youngest}} sons, who {{had been}} following their father believing they were being invited to visit the ship again with the ruler, began to climb into the boats that were waiting at the shore. Kānekapōlei shouted to them {{to get out of}} the boat and pleaded with her husband to stop. The ruler then realized that Cook and his men were not asking him to visit the ship, but forcing him. At this point he stopped and sat down.|$|E
25|$|According to a Coonamble {{resident}} who encountered the Kellys at Glenrowan, Ned {{had heard that}} an individual named Sullivan had given evidence, {{and that he had}} travelled by train from Melbourne to Rutherglen. The Kelly gang then followed him there, but was told that he went to Uralla across the border in New South Wales. By the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> to Uralla, Sullivan had left for Wagga Wagga. They followed him there but lost sight of him. Kelly thought that he might have travelled to Hay, so they took off in that direction but later gave up their chase. On their return home, they passed through Jerilderie, and the gang then decided to rob the bank.|$|E

The Bulls kept scoring and scoring and scoring {{in front of}} gleeful home crowd and a national audience. The Bearcats could seemingly do little to stop the Bulls onslaught. The Bulls rang up 51 {{points in the first}} half alone and trampled the Bearcats with 361 rushing yards. The Bulls scored each of the five <b>times</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> into the Red Zone. The loss prevented the Bearcats from becoming bowl-eligible.|$|R
25|$|Frank DeSimone {{was born}} in 1909 in Pueblo, Colorado. As a child {{his family moved to}} California. Desimone {{graduated}} from the University of Southern California Law School and became a lawyer in May 1933. Soon after he turned to a life in crime. DeSimone was involved in one of the botched assassination attempts on Mickey Cohen. Jimmy Fratianno signaled DeSimone after a meeting with Cohen and DeSimone pulled up in a car with Frank Bompensiero, Leo Moceri, and another armed man. By the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> past Cohen's bodyguards, Cohen escaped. With a job as an attorney, DeSimone was able to avoid police scrutiny. His lawyer career was no front job however. In the 1940s and 1950s DeSimone served as lawyer for mobsters such as Jimmy Fratianno and Johnny Roselli as well as providing legal aid to others.|$|E
25|$|Their biggest {{test in the}} Championship came against Kerry in the semi-final. This was {{the first}} time Tyrone had met Kerry in the Championship since the All-Ireland Final in 1986. Many pundits believe this was Tyrone's {{definitive}} display of 2003. They deployed a 'blanket defence,' whereby as soon as they lost possession of the ball, all players were ready to win it back. Kerry players, from the full-back line to the forwards, found themselves harried by three or four players around them every <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> the ball, meaning they were under pressure for space, and time to release the ball. Detractors (famously, Pat Spillane, himself a Kerry player from the 1986 final) called this style 'puke football' because it stifled the flow of the game of Gaelic football. It was extremely effective however, and the 0–13 to 0–6 scoreline that Tyrone won by was flattering for Kerry.|$|E
25|$|Atlanta {{started off}} {{the second half}} with a 9-play, 80-yard drive to take their first lead of the game on Miller's 20-yard scoring pass to Haynes. The rest of the quarter would belong to the Saints, who {{consumed}} a franchise playoff record 10:49 by driving 80 yards in 19 plays and going back up 20-17 with a 1-yard touchdown run by Hilliard. New Orleans was aided by another key penalty against the Falcons defense, an offsides penalty against linebacker Jessie Tuggle on an Andersen field goal attempt that gave the Saints a first down. With 7:43 left in the game, Johnson kicked a field goal to tie the score at 20 {{at the end of}} a 45-yard drive. The next <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> the ball, Haynes took off past cornerback Milton Mack, caught a short slant from Miller, and raced 61 yards to the end zone, giving Atlanta a 27-20 lead. After Haynes scored the winning touchdown for the Falcons, the Saints reached the Atlanta 35-yard line before Hebert threw an interception to Falcons defensive back Tim McKyer to clinch the victory.|$|E

25|$|Australia {{were left}} to chase 449 for the victory and made a strong start, {{reaching}} 139 by {{the close of the}} fourth day without losing a wicket, and went on to 208 before Fraser had Slater (103, 10 fours) caught by Tufnell. An hour later, after a rain-lengthened lunch break, Malcolm uprooted Taylor's off stump for 113 and the intent to chase was quelled. Boon batted for an hour and three-quarters for 17, but after his dismissal Fraser (5–73) made the most of the damp conditions, delivering a series of seaming deliveries to the Australian middle order that saw Bevan, both Waugh brothers and Healy returned to the pavilion, Rhodes taking three catches. The fading light saw Hick, Tufnell and Gooch bowling at this critical time instead of Gough and Malcolm, with Warne and May batting out the last hour to save the draw, Malcolm spilled a catch from Warne off {{what appeared to be the}} final delivery of the match and the players walked off thinking the game was over, only to realise by the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> to the pitch edge that there was still time for one more over.|$|E
25|$|Detroit {{finally managed}} to put some points on the board the next <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> the ball, driving 46 yards in nine plays. The key play was a 17-yard run by Ron Rivers on fourth and 4 from the Lions 45. After {{reaching}} the Buccaneers 17, Mitchell suffered a concussion on a 2-yard run {{and was replaced by}} Frank Reich. On the next play after the injury, Jason Hanson kicked a 33-yard field goal, cutting the score to 20-3. Then after a Bucs punt, Reich completed all five of his pass attempts for 71 yards (3 of them to Johnnie Morton for 45) on the way to Tommy Vardell's 1-yard touchdown run, and the lead was trimmed to 20-10. The Lions seemed primed to make a serious comeback attempt when they forced Tampa Bay into a third and 5 situation on their own 10-yard line, but Dilfer's 50-yard completion to Robb Thomas moved the ball to the Lions 36. The Bucs were unable to score, but Sean Landeta's punt pinned the Lions back at their own 4-yard line with 3:20 left in the game. Then after completing a 14-yard pass on third and 15 during their final drive, Reich accidentally spiked the ball on fourth down, giving the ball to Tampa Bay.|$|E
25|$|The {{responsibility}} for Maya Pass lay with Stewart's 2nd Division. That morning, Stewart {{decided that the}} French would not attack, left the brigades of Major General William Pringle and Lieutenant Colonel John Cameron in the valley and rode to Elizondo, ten miles to the south. Some French soldiers were seen and light companies were sent up {{in support of the}} picket. When the French attacked in force, the British forces in the valley had to climb to the pass in full kit. By the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> up, the picket force was wiped out and 10,000 of d'Erlon's men occupied the pass. In the Battle of Maya, Pringle opposed Darmagnac's division, while Cameron faced the rest of the French corps. The 4,000 British tried manfully to retake the pass, but they were unable to do so. On the other hand, the narrowness of the defile helped the British to hold off d'Erlon's immensely superior force. When Stewart returned at 2:00 pm, he pulled the redcoats back to a second position. By 3:00 pm, the British {{were on the verge of}} disaster. At this point, Major General Edward Barnes's brigade of Dalhousie's 7th Division arrived from the west to strike d'Erlon in the flank and the battle died down. The British lost 1,610 men and four cannons out of 6,000, while French losses numbered 2,100 out of 20,900. That evening, Lieutenant General Rowland Hill authorized a retreat to Elizondo. D'Erlon worried about Barnes's incursion and pursued very cautiously the next day. He only advanced six miles on the 26th.|$|E

500|$|During {{the descent}} of the Passo del Bocco in stage 3, [...] rider Wouter Weylandt crashed and {{suffered}} catastrophic injury. Race doctor Giovanni Tredici, {{and the doctor}} for the [...] team were in cars very near Weylandt's group on the road, and administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation for approximately 40 minutes. Doctors also gave Weylandt adrenaline and atropine to try to restart his heart, though Tredici stated that resuscitation efforts were rather clearly in vain, and that Weylandt was already dead by the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> to him. Doctors {{were never able to}} revive Weylandt, and he was declared dead on the spot. A short time later, Weylandt's body was airlifted off the descent and taken to a nearby hospital, where the pathologist conducting the autopsy concluded that the Belgian had died immediately upon crashing. Weylandt's death was the first at the Giro in 25 years, and the first at one of cycling's Grand Tours since Fabio Casartelli died during the 1995 Tour de France.|$|E

500|$|Practice {{started on}} the Friday with Alonso leading {{at the end of}} both the two {{practice}} sessions. In both sessions, he outpaced his teammate and the closest Ferrari driven by Felipe Massa. BMW Sauber were pleased with 5th place in the first session and 7th in the second from Nick Heidfeld despite his report that the car was [...] "very difficult to drive". But Robert Kubica's car suffered a fuel leak resulting in him being unable to post a timed lap in the morning session, Kubica also told the press after the fuel leak, [...] "the car has been quite difficult to drive." [...] Both Red Bull drivers finished in the top ten of the morning practice. Honda were slower than its customer team Super Aguri in the first practice, but Barrichello was faster than Takuma Sato in the second practice. Toyota's suspension problems meant that their second practice was cut short, but not before Ralf Schumacher narrowly missed a groundhog that ran across the track. After experiencing problems with Jarno Trulli's suspension, Toyota stopped both drivers for 45 minutes as a precautionary measure. By the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> the cars back on the track, they only managed a few extra laps until the problem recurred. Heikki Kovalainen ended his practice day by going into the wall at turn 7, damaging the suspension. His teammate, Fisichella, performed better, staying in the top 8 in both sessions. At the end of the afternoon practice, Mark Webber slowed down unexpectedly before turn 8 causing Scott Speed to drive {{into the back of the}} Red Bull. Webber had overtaken Speed just before this incident.|$|E

Lucas was distraught, wanting to kill EJ for raping her. He expressed shame over the man he had been - not standing by Sami in the past - and tearfully apologized, stating it was his fault Sami felt she couldn't come to him after being raped and tormented by EJ. He vowed {{to be a better}} man for her, the kind she can depend on.|$|R
60|$|At the {{beginning}} of the second half it was seen that Guy Frapley and his fellow-players were determined to do something if they could. But they were excited and wild, and the captain could do little to hold them in. Several <b>times</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> confused on the signals, and once one of the new ends lost the ball on a fumble that looked almost childish. Inside of ten minutes, amid a mad yelling from the Lemington supporters, the ball was forced over the Oak Hall line for another touchdown, and another goal was kicked. Then, five minutes later, came a goal from the field.|$|R

[...] After a Dolphins punt, Oakland drove 41 yards in 10 plays to score on Sebastian Janikowski's 36-yard field goal. [...] The next <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> the ball, Oakland advanced 78 yards, featuring a 32-yard completion from Rich Gannon to running back Terry Kirby, and scored on Jankikowski's 33-yard field goal to go up 13-0 early in the second quarter.|$|E
