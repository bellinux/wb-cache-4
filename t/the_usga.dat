25|$|Many {{supporters}} of Hogan and some golf historians feel that his {{victory at the}} Hale America Open in 1942 should be counted as his fifth U.S. Open and 10th major championship, since the tournament {{was to be a}} substitute for the Open after its cancellation by <b>the</b> <b>USGA.</b> The Hale America Open was held in the same time slot and was run like the U.S. Open with more than 1,500 entries, local qualifying at 69 sites and sectional qualifying at most major cities. The top players, who were not off fighting in World War II, participated and the largest purse of the year was awarded.|$|E
500|$|The first trophy {{presented}} to the champions was from the Spokane Athletic Round Table, until 1953. The original trophy by <b>the</b> <b>USGA</b> was designed by the silversmith of J. E.

[...] Now, the champion receives the Harton S. Semple trophy, named for a former USGA Committeeman and <b>the</b> <b>USGA</b> President from 1973–1974.

2500|$|Herreshoff {{defeated}} Chick Evans in the semi-finals. He was trailing Hilton by six {{holes in}} the final match but managed to mount a stunning comeback to tie the match {{and send it to}} a playoff. On the 37th hole of the match, Hilton sliced his approach shot badly but instead of finding the deep rough right of the green his ball ricocheted off a flat rock and luckily landed on the green. Herreshoff, meanwhile, topped his approach shot to a position short of the green. [...] His pitch shot to the par 4 hole went 20 feet past the pin. Hilton two-putted for par while Herreshoff was unable to make his 20-foot putt to save par. Hilton was declared the winner and was awarded the Havemeyer Cup, a trophy given to <b>the</b> <b>USGA</b> by golf enthusiast and millionaire sugar dealer Theodore Havemeyer.

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>USGA</b> and R {{sanction}} a [...] "Modified Stableford" [...] {{system for}} scratch players, which makes par worth zero, a birdie worth 2, eagle 5 and double-eagle 8, while a bogey is a penalty of -1 and a double-bogey or worse -3. As {{with the original}} system, the highest score wins the game, and terrible scores {{on one or two}} holes won't wreck an entire game, but this system rewards [...] "bogey-birdie" [...] play more than the original, encouraging golfers {{to try to make the}} riskier birdie putt or eagle chipshot instead of simply parring each hole.|$|E
2500|$|Irwin's first U.S. Open triumph came at Winged Foot in 1974 {{at the age}} of 29. In {{what became}} known as [...] "The Massacre at Winged Foot", Irwin won with a score of 7-over par, the second-highest winning score in {{relation}} to par of any U.S. Open since 1945. The course conditions at Winged Foot in 1974 were described as [...] "brutal". Johnny Miller and several other players suggested that <b>the</b> <b>USGA</b> had intentionally made the Winged Foot course setup particularly treacherous in response to Miller's record-breaking round of 63 at Oakmont the year before. Irwin, however, said in 1974: [...] "I've always enjoyed playing tough courses. It's much more of a challenge to me." [...] Irwin earned $35,000 for his victory at Winged Foot and said that he had a vivid dream three weeks earlier that he won the U.S. Open, which he only told his wife about.|$|E

2500|$|Schenectady putters, marked [...] "Patent Applied For", were {{produced}} {{prior to its}} patent on March 24, 1903. The Schenectady Putter was among the [...] "centered-shafted, mallet-headed implements" [...] that were banned by the Royal & Ancient Golf Club Committee on the Rules of golf in 1910, {{in response to a}} request from a golf club in New Zealand. [...] The R's ban included the Schenectady Putter. [...] There is no evidence that Travis's use of the Schenectady to win the 1904 British Amateur contributed to this controversial ruling, though the myth persists. [...] The ruling became controversial because, for the first time, an R ruling was not wholly adopted by the United States Golf Association. [...] <b>The</b> <b>USGA</b> agreed with the banning of mallet-headed clubs but ruled that the Schenectady Putter, and other center-shafted putters did not fall within this category. [...] The R ban on center-shafted putters was finally removed in 1951.|$|E
2500|$|Travis {{became a}} student of the layout and design {{features}} of golf courses early in his golfing career as the result of trips to Great Britain. [...] In late 1901, Travis wrote an article, published in the Bulletin of <b>the</b> <b>USGA,</b> titled, [...] "Impressions of British Golf". [...] He observed that in [...] "England and Scotland ... you have golf—golf in its best and highest form". [...] He referred to the [...] "radical difference in their physical configurations in relation to our courses." [...] He was impressed with the lack of trees, the number and placement of bunkers, the natural undulations of the greens, and the quality of turf. In a later article, Travis presented his ideas for the design of a [...] "first class" [...] golf course. In this article, Travis emphasized the importance of soil that provides natural drainage, land that is more or less undulating—neither flat nor hilly ... but a judicious blending of the two extremes and trees of any kind are non-existent—as they should be, and holes should be so laid out as to provide for the playing of every conceivable sort of stroke, with every club in one's bag. [...] He noted, diversity of play should be the aim of the architect of a first-class course.|$|E
2500|$|Jones was {{not only}} a consummately skilled golfer but {{exemplified}} the principles of sportsmanship and fair play. In {{the first round of the}} 1925 U.S. Open at the Worcester Country Club near Boston, his approach shot to the 11th hole's elevated green fell short into the deep rough of the embankment. As he took his stance to pitch onto the green, the head of his club brushed the grass and caused a slight movement of the ball. He took the shot, then informed his playing partner Walter Hagen and <b>the</b> <b>USGA</b> official covering their match that he was calling a penalty on himself. Hagen was unable to talk him out of it, and they continued play. [...] After the round and before he signed his scorecard, officials argued with Jones but he insisted that he had violated Rule 18, moving a ball at rest after address, and took a 77 instead of the 76 he otherwise would have carded. Jones' self-imposed one-stroke penalty eventually cost him the win by a stroke in regulation, necessitating a playoff, which he then lost. Although praised by many sports writers for his gesture, Jones was reported to have said, [...] "You might as well praise me for not robbing banks." ...|$|E
