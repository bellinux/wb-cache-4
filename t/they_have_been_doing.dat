5|$|The episode's story {{focuses on}} couple Nikki Fernandez (Kiele Sanchez) and Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro). The flashbacks reveal their lives before {{arriving}} on the island, and what <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> between day one and day eighty-one. Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) returned {{for the fifth}} time since his death late in the first season. Furthermore, Ethan (William Mapother) and Dr. Arzt (Daniel Roebuck) reprised their guest roles in flashbacks. The episode got a mixed response from critics and fans, with positive reception considering it an entertaining send-off to two unpopular characters, but negative reviews deeming it unnecessary.|$|E

25|$|Bureaucratic {{structures}} {{have many}} levels of management ranging from senior executives to regional managers, {{all the way}} to department store managers. Since there are many levels, decision-making authority has to pass through more layers than flatter organizations. A bureaucratic organization has rigid and tight procedures, policies and constraints. This kind of structure is reluctant to adapt or change what <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> since the company started. Organizational charts exist for every department, and everyone understands who is in charge and what their responsibilities are for every situation. Decisions are made through an organized process, and a strict command and control structure is present at all times.In bureaucratic structures, the authority is at the top and information is then flowed from top to bottom. This causes for more rules and standards for the company which operational process is watched with close supervision. Some advantages for bureaucratic structures for top-level managers are they have a tremendous control over organizational structure decisions. This works best for managers who have a command and control style of managing. Strategic decision-making is also faster because there are fewer people it has to go through to approve. Some disadvantages in bureaucratic structures are it can discourage creativity and innovation in the organization. This can make it hard for a company to adapt to changing conditions in the marketplace.|$|E

500|$|In 2015, Congressman Tom McClintock {{introduced}} HR 1668, the [...] "Save Our Water Act", which [...] "amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) {{to suspend}} during droughts {{the application of}} the ESA to water releases from water storage facilities by federal and state agencies in a navigable river basin." [...] McClintock specifically cited the release of [...] from New Melones Lake over several weeks in spring 2015, when New Melones Lake was approaching its lowest level on record since the 1992 drought. That year, very few fish had returned to the Stanislaus to spawn; in an editorial for MyMotherLode, Mark Truppner wrote: [...] "Biologists estimate that it will affect the offspring of about 29 steelhead trout in the Stanislaus River – a few hundred smolts [...] almost all of which will be eaten by predators long before they reach the ocean. [...] And that assumes they won’t swim toward the ocean on their own – as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> without our helpful assistance since time immemorial." [...] However the bill did not pass.|$|E

[...] "Now, everybody should take the government at its word and celebrate Christmas the way they normally celebrate and express their religious faith." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{criticism}} {{that was made}} of Dewey as governor lay in his treatment of New York legislators and political opponents. Dewey [...] "cracked the whip ruthlessly on (Republican) legislators who strayed from the party fold. Assemblymen have found themselves {{under investigation by the}} State Tax Department after opposing the Governor over an insurance regulation bill. Others discover job-rich construction projects, state buildings, even highways, directed to friendlier [...]" [...] Dewey [...] "forced the legislature his own party dominates to reform its comfortable ways of payroll padding. Now legislative workers must verify in writing every two weeks what <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> to earn their salary; every state senator and assemblyman must verify that [...] are telling the truth. All this has occasioned more than grumbling. Some Assemblymen have quit in protest. Others have been denied renomination by Dewey's formidable political organization. Reporters mutter among themselves about government by blackmail." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{distinguishing}} factor between [...] "Western Sephardim" [...] and {{the nascent}} [...] "Neo-Western Sephardim" [...] {{is the time}} frame of the reversions to Judaism, {{the location of the}} reversions, and the precarious religious and legal circumstances surrounding their reversions, including impediments and persecutions. Thus, the converso descendants who became the Western Sephardim had reverted to Judaism between the 16th and 18th centuries, they did so at a time before the abolition of the Inquisition in the 19th century, and this time frame necessitated their migration out of the Iberian cultural sphere. Conversely, the converso descendants who are today becoming the nascent Neo-Western Sephardim have been reverting to Judaism between the late 20th and early 21st centuries, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> so at a time after the abolition of the Inquisition in the 19th century, and this time frame has not necessitated their migration out of the Iberian cultural sphere.|$|E
2500|$|According to Weiner, {{he chose}} the 1960s because [...] "every time I would try and find {{something}} interesting that I wanted to do, it happened in 1960. It will blow your mind {{if you look at}} the year on the almanac. And it's not just the election [...] The pill came out in March 1960, that's really what I wanted it to be around.... That's the largest change in the entire world. Seriously, it's just astounding. Especially {{if you look at the}} movies from the 50s. Once it was acceptable to talk about this idea that teenagers were having sex, which <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing,</b> obviously, since time immemorial, there were all these movies like Blue Denim, and Peyton Place ... he central tension in every movie that does not take place on the battlefield is about a girl getting pregnant. So all of a sudden that entire issue [...] has been removed from society. That was what I was interested in in 1960." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stewart {{returns to}} the office and chats to his co-worker, Charlotte, with whom they share a very fond friendship, albeit a totally platonic one. Charlotte, openly a devout Christian {{frequently}} reading her Bible, lends Stewart a video of a programme she recorded, Songs That Changed My Life. Stewart agrees to please Charlotte, and returns home to the flat he shares with his sister, Imogen. After Imogen goes out for the evening, Stewart puts the video on. The programme is a religious one consisting exclusively of Christian songs that various obscure Christian figures find uplifting, and Stewart is barely interested – until the programme ends. Then the video returns to what was partly recorded over – a pornographic video – [...] and Stewart watches in amazement. Imogen, in the meantime, spends the whole evening waiting for a date from a dating agency who fails to turn up. When Imogen returns home, both she and Stewart lie about what <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> that evening.|$|E
