40|$|At the University of California, Los Angeles, the Test of Oral Proficiency (TOP), an {{internally}} developed oral proficiency test, {{is administered}} to international teaching assistant (ITA) candidates to ensure an appropriate level of academic oral English proficiency. Test taker performances are rated live by two raters according to four subscales. While the subscale scores have potential as valuable feedback to major stakeholders, only a weighted {{average of the}} four subscale scores are currently reported and used. This study presents a way of extracting valuable information from the TOP subscale scores. In particular, it investigates an approach to obtaining oral English proficiency profiles based on the subscale score patterns of 960 <b>TOP</b> <b>test</b> takers. This study utilized item response theory and finite mixture modeling to investigate profiles of academic oral English proficiency {{in terms of the}} TOP subscales. A higher-order generalization of the graded response model was formulated to estimate subscale scores that accounted for structural dependencies and rater effects in the observed TOP scores. The estimated scores were clustered using a multivariate normal mixture model to yield subscale score profiles. The mixture model suggested seven profile groups and classified the <b>TOP</b> <b>test</b> takers into the seven groups. The profile groups were then interpreted and labeled based on characteristic score patterns and linguistic background shared by group members. To achieve a thorough understanding of the resulting profiles, discourse features of test taker performances sampled from different profile groups were closely examined. A small corpus was constructed based on the sampled test taker performances and compared to a reference corpus to explore the overall pattern of <b>TOP</b> <b>test</b> takers' language use. The comparison showed that the <b>TOP</b> <b>test</b> takers tended to use relatively fewer function words than speakers in the reference corpus. Characteristic features of each profile group's discourse were investigated through an identification and examination of discourse organizing lexical bundles. The results suggested that the use of metadiscourse and textual reference bundles with an explicit past reference point might be related to test takers' academic oral English proficiency...|$|R

40|$|The International Space Station (ISS) Urine Processor Assembly (UPA) {{experienced}} a hardware {{failure in the}} Distillation Assembly (DA) in October 2010. Initially the UPA was operated to recover 85 % of the water from urine through distillation, concentrating the contaminants in the remaining urine. The DA failed due to precipitation of calcium sulfate (gypsum) which caused a loss of UPA function. The ISS UPA operations have been modified to only recover 70 % of the water minimizing gypsum precipitation risk but substantially increasing water resupply needs. This paper describes the feasibility assessment of several technologies (ion exchange, chelating agents, threshold inhibitors, and Lorentz devices) to prevent gypsum precipitation. The feasibility assessment includes the development of assessment methods, chemical modeling, bench <b>top</b> <b>testing,</b> and validation testing in a flight-like ground UPA unit.

30|$|In the intact, {{formalin}} preserved human cadaver, {{we found}} that the gastrocsoleus and tibialis posterior muscles were short and stiff and had caused equinovarus contractures of the foot and ankle. These contractures have some similarities to the equinovarus contractures found in chronic neuromuscular diseases. We suggest that the formalin preserved human cadaver MTU may be a reasonable model for biomechanical testing and useful proxy for the simulation of surgical procedures for the correction of fixed contractures. Formalin fixation does not change the mineral composition or structure of tissue but it can cause stiffness [29]. However, we recognize the limitations of the model and the dangers of extrapolating findings based on bench <b>top</b> <b>testing</b> to the clinical situation. The clinical situation is much more complex, because the effects of spasticity are superimposed on the effects of contracture. Despite the increasing use of dynamic assessments such as gait analysis, it is usual practice to perform an examination under anesthesia (EUA), prior to lengthening MTUs, for fixed contracture. At that moment, the surgeon must determine where to locate the IMT. We do not suggest that quantitative extrapolations can be made from our work to the situation at EUA. Rather we suggest that there is a simple underlying principle, which is that the site of the MTU determines the lengthening characteristics.|$|E

The vane has also been used to characterize dry powders and granular solids, the effect of non-cohesive solids with interstitial fluids and used as a guide to determine if slip is present in the geometries typically used to perform rheological flow curve measurements. The vane has been extensively characterized for measuring the shear strength in soils in both field and laboratory studies.

The loss of a lower limb greatly diminishes the amount of natural force generation provided that is necessary to propel oneself up stairs. This study investigated possible solutions to the problem of stair ascension for transfemoral amputees by the means of designing and developing an externally attachable device to a prosthesis. The number of amputations from military service has greatly increased since 2008, which shows there is a clear need for assistive devices (Wenke, Krueger, 2 Ì 6 Ficke, 2012). With the number of amputations rising and no current externally attachable products on the market to aid in stair ascension for transfemoral amputees, the need for this specific device has become more prominent. Research, previous work, and preliminary testing provided a basis for design and development of a new prototype. Bench <b>top</b> <b>testing</b> was conducted to review concepts in the prototype and provide data for further modifications. Results from testing of previous work, as well as testing of new concepts and modifications, provided a framework for designing a new externally attachable device for assistance in stair ascension.

Success of the deviceâs performance was based on bench top results and feedback from amputees, noting both the advantages and shortcomings of the new prototype.

40|$|Accurate and {{reliable}} in vivo measurement systems for orthopedic applications will allow {{a better understanding}} of native joint loading, gait patterns, and changes during healing and tissue regeneration. Robust {{and reliable}} telemetry units with an implantable transmitter and data acquisition software are necessary to insure long-term measurements. It was the goal of this study to update the current implantable telemetry system. Updates included using a new tablet computer for increased rates of data acquisition and encasing transmitters in a new waterproof casing. Software was developed using Labview on a Windows based Acer Iconia Tab. The Labview program allowed the user to save data to a measurement file and view the data in real time. The increased processing power of the tablet resulted in an increase in data collection rates from 29 Hz to 87 Hz. Interfacing the tablet computer with the telemetry system required the use of a RS- 232 protocol to USB adapter. The newly developed tablet computer system was also used for load measurement collection during the most recent in vivo study. In order to insure transmitter function in vivo it was necessary to characterize the factors affecting transmission in vivo and develop transmitter and power coil designs that operated reliably. In the past implantable transmitters were noted to operate properly during bench <b>top</b> <b>testing,</b> but often failed after being placed in vivo. The two factors studied that limited power transfer to the transmitters were immersion in an aqueous environment and exposure to elevated temperatures. An aqueous environment significantly decreased power transfer by 11. 9 % (p-value = 0. 014) relative to testing on the bench top. Additionally, a temperature increase to 40 Â°C decreased power transfer by 6. 2 % (p-value = 0. 017) when compared to power transfer in room temperature air. A solution that restored transmitter function required encasing transmitters in a new waterproof casing. Different casing designs made of silicone and semi-solid triglycerides were developed and tested on the bench top. Two different casing designs were used during in vivo testing and implanted into test animals. One casing design insured transmission while the other separated in vivo and did not facilitate transmission...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to create and implement a design strategy to improve the impeller design of the Left Ventricle Assist Device (LVAD) here at RIT. CFD software paired with parametric design optimization has proved as a useful tool set to improve VAD performance in a timely and cost effective manner. A design search of one design variable was conducted to test the implementation of the design strategy. Performance of a LVAD is split between three individual parameters: 1) Pressure generation, 2) Rate of Hemolysis, and 3) Risk of Thrombosis. CFD simulations provided the data necessary to assess all areas of performance to provide a basis for comparing performances of created designs versus the original impeller. The current version of the LVAD was modeled using CFD simulations and was tested for repeatability and accuracy with bench top test data serving as the basis. Data collected from the simulations was then assessed to calculate rate of hemolysis, thrombosis risk and the pressure performance of design iteration. A weighted matrix was used to create a means to compare overall performance. Iterations were created until the local optimum was found for the design parameter tested. Pressure performance raised in all designs was tested, while there were mixed results in terms of rate of hemolysis and thrombosis risk. The top performing design dropped the risk of thrombosis by 10. 8 %, reduced rate of hemolysis by 0. 8 % and increased pressure output by 17. 4 % when compared to the original impeller performance. Various matrix weighting schemes were applied to verify the design as the local optimal. This also served to find the most appropriate weight balance to the three performance parameters. The design strategy that was tested and implemented has proven successful by creating an optimal impeller design for the design space explored. This study has provided the basis for a more complete design search to be completed over multiple design parameters. Another area for future studies is to complete bench <b>top</b> <b>testing</b> of the optimal design iteration created. The results from the testing can be used to further improve blood damage modeling by raising the accuracy of performance assessment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Salt water environments {{are very}} harsh on {{materials}} that are used within them. Many issues are caused by either corrosion and/or internal degradation to the materials themselves. Composites are better suited for this environment due to their high strength to weight ratios and their corrosion resistance, but very {{little is known about}} the fracture mechanics of composites. The goal of this study is to gain a better understanding for the behavior of a composite boat hull under a shear loading, similar to the force water applies on the hull as the boat moves through the water; then attempt to strengthen the composite sandwich panel against the shear loading. A parametric study was conducted to investigate monotonic in-plane shear loading for composite sandwich panels used in commercial naval vessels. In order to model a conventional composite boat hull, test specimens were composite sandwich panels made of a Divinycell H 100 foam core with four layers of fiberglass on both sides of the core. Specimens were tested under a monotonic loading with a rate of 0. 2 in/min, and tested until complete failure using the standard test. Seawater specimens were manufactured in the same manner as the original test specimens, but then were submersed in either filtered seawater or the ocean. The differences between the filtered pieces and the ocean allowed us to determine if any changes found in the composite sandwich panels were related to environment conditions or if the changes were related to the saltwater interaction itself. To create these different environments the seawater specimens were taken to the Avila pier where 36 specimens were placed in a tub that was fed filtered saltwater, while 30 specimens were placed in a plastic mesh with weights and lowered to a depth of approximately 30 ft. in the ocean. Three specimens were then removed at monthly intervals from both filtered and ocean environments. Shear Keys were created as a method to strengthen the composite sandwich panels against the shear force that the previous specimens had been tested to. Eight Shear Keys were then placed into groves cut into the foam core (four on each side) and the four fiberglass layers were laid on <b>top.</b> <b>Testing</b> showed that the seawater did have an initial effect on the composite sandwich panels. The filtered pieces showed a decrease in yield strength and stiffness the longer they were subjected to the seawater. The raw unfiltered pieces placed in the ocean saw an even higher decrease in their yield strength and decrease in stiffness. However, for both the unfiltered and raw specimens there was an increase in the ultimate strength and fracture point of the specimens. The effects of the sea water seemed to taper off after the 3 rd month however. The Shear Key specimens were tested with a 4 mm and an 8 mm Shear Key. The 8 mm Shear Keys showed a decrease in shear strength, which was primarily due to removing too much material from the core and weakening the specimen. It was concluded that the decrease in area created a force concentration at the deepest part of the Shear Key causing the premature failure. The 4 mm Shear Key showed an increase in the yield strength, ultimate strength, and fracture point. A finite model was built to simulate the original test specimen along with the 4 mm and 8 mm Shear Key cases, and the results were compared to the experimental results. The numerical results showed that it was possible to relate the experimental results to the linear or elastic portion of the plots. There was a difference between the maximum displacement of the model and the actual specimens, but this was attributed to potential inaccurate comparison of the loading on the model compared to the actual specimens. The correlation between the model itself and the experimental data was close enough to conclude that it could be used for predicting baseline trends. Further investigation of the specimens should include looking into the effects of a cyclic shear loading on the specimens. This combined with the seawater element used in this thesis would provide further insight to the initial degradation seen in the seawater specimens, and could potentially provide a closer relation to current hull failures. In addition to including a cyclic loading another numerical model should be created. A model that could be constrained both locally and globally would provide more accurate results. The FEM should also include the ability to run a crushable foam core model within the solver which would also increase the accuracy of the numerical solution...|$|E

40|$|Fatalities {{caused by}} car {{accidents}} accounted for 1. 2 million worldwide in 2004. Chest injuries are the second death cause, after head injuries, in vehicle accidents. Devices to predict {{risk of injury}} are fundamental to develop and evaluate restraint systems that can mitigate the injury severity and reduce the fatalities. This can be achieved with mathematical Human Body Models (HBM). An HBM needs to be biofidelic, {{both in terms of}} size and biomechanical response. Herein, the biofidelity of the thorax region in an HBM is evaluated. The evaluation focuses on whole body kinematics and chest response during frontal car accidents. Finite element simulations with an HBM were performed with the code LS-DYNA [1]. A modified version of Total HUman Model for Safety v 3. 0 (THUMS) [2] has been the basis for the work presented here. THUMS was modified to improve its robustness and numerical stability. The meshes of the rib cage, skin around the ribcage, and intercostal muscles were refined. THUMS represents a 50 th percentile male and has approximately 150, 000 elements. It was compared with cadaver pendulum impacts [3], table <b>top</b> <b>tests</b> [4], and sled tests [5]. The pendulum test consist of a cylinder with diameter 125 mm, mass of 23. 4 kg and an initial speed of 4. 3 m/s impacting on the middle of the sternum. The table <b>top</b> <b>tests</b> included four loading conditions of the chest: hub, diagonal belt, double diagonal belt, and distributed load. The sled test was performed at 40 km/h, using a three point standard seat belt. The model has been compared to cadaver experiments on different load cases, which are representative of modern automotive restraint systems. In general, THUMS showed a good agreement with the experimental corridors for the pendulum and table <b>top</b> <b>tests.</b> The chest response in the sled test differed for the lower chest, possibly due to the absence of biofidelic fracture simulations in the THUMS. After comparing the kinematic and dynamic responses of THUMS with cadaver experiments it was concluded that the model is adequate to simulate the human response under frontal impacts. The next step is to identify parameters that can predict the risk of rib fracture and then become a tool to evaluate new restraint systems...|$|R
