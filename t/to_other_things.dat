5|$|Walton's last {{work of the}} 1940s was {{his music}} for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On {{the advice of the}} BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's {{relations}} with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>things.</b> In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle's predecessor, Plato, {{argued that}} all things have a {{universal}} form, {{which could be}} either a property or a relation <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>things.</b> When we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyze a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, {{so that we can}} speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other.|$|E

For example, a red spot on a wall is physical in its dependence on the wall and the pigment of which it is made, but it is mental in so far as its perceived redness depends on the workings of the visual system. Unlike dual-aspect theory, neutral monism does not posit a more fundamental substance of which mind and body are aspects.|$|E
25|$|FTL is {{the product}} of the two-man team of Subset Games, Matthew Davis and Justin Ma. Both were {{employees}} of 2K Games's Shanghai studio, and became friends during their tenure there, playing various board games in their free time. Ma, who considered himself a jack-of-all-trades, had become dissatisfied with working in a larger studio, and after traveling to the 2011 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco and seeing the Independent Games Festival, he realized he wanted to become an independent developer. Davis had left 2K Games early in 2011, and after biking through China, returned and joined Ma, who had also recently quit, and began working on the core FTL game. They agreed they would spend a year towards development and if their efforts did not pan out, they would go on <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>things.</b> Following the success of the game, the pair began work on their second game, Into the Breach.|$|E
25|$|In summertime village cricket is {{the delight}} of everyone. Nearly every village has its own cricket field where the young men play and the old men watch. In the village of Lintz in County Durham {{they have their own}} ground, where they have played these last 70 years. They tend it well. The wicket area is well rolled and mown. The outfield is kept short. It has a good club house for the players and seats for the onlookers. The village team play there on Saturdays and Sundays. They belong to a league, {{competing}} with the neighbouring villages. On other evenings after work they practise while the light lasts. Yet now after these 70 years a judge of the High Court has ordered that they must not play there any more. He has issued an injunction to stop them. He has done it at the instance of a newcomer who is no lover of cricket. This newcomer has built, or has had built for him, a house {{on the edge of the}} cricket ground which four years ago was a field where cattle grazed. The animals did not mind the cricket. But now this adjoining field has been turned into a housing estate. The newcomer bought one of the houses on the edge of the cricket ground. No doubt the open space was a selling point. Now he complains that when a batsman hits a six the ball has been known to land in his garden or on or near his house. His wife has got so upset about it that they always go out at week-ends. They do not go into the garden when cricket is being played. They say that this is intolerable. So they asked the judge to stop the cricket being played. And the judge, much against his will, has felt that he must order the cricket to be stopped: with the consequence, I suppose, that the Lintz Cricket Club will disappear. The cricket ground will be turned to some other use. I expect for more houses or a factory. The young men will turn <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> instead of cricket. The whole village will be much the poorer. And all this because of a newcomer who has just bought a house there next to the cricket ground.|$|E

500|$|For one, Cobb has {{stressed}} the {{problems inherent in}} what he calls the “substantialist” worldview—ultimately derived from Classical Greek philosophy—that still dominates Christian theology, as well as most of western thought. [...] This [...] "substantialist" [...] way of thinking necessitates a mind-matter dualism, in which matter and mind are two fundamentally different kinds of entities. [...] It also encourages seeing relations between entities as being unimportant to what the entity is [...] "in itself." [...] In contrast to this view, Cobb follows Whitehead in attributing primacy to events and processes rather than substances. [...] In this Whiteheadian view, nothing is contained within its own sharp boundaries. [...] In fact, the way in which a thing relates <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> is what makes it [...] "what it is." [...] Cobb writes: ...|$|E

2500|$|Baccara's {{fourth and}} final album (in the band's {{original}} incarnation) was Bad Boys, released in 1981. By this time the disco sound had been overshadowed by newer music movements (such as punk, new wave and synthpop) in much of Europe and interest was largely confined to those countries where the duo had an established fan base, notably Germany. The album was not released in the UK or US. Baccara have been (possibly unfairly) described as a [...] "one hit wonder" [...] in the UK, while they never achieved any recognition in the US despite some of their songs being given significant airplay.

2500|$|In the media, {{the ideal}} {{version of a}} man {{is seen as a}} strong, toned man. The {{idealized}} version of a woman is thin (Aubrey, pg. 7). The concept of body evaluation is more common in criticizing women. However, body evaluation revolves more towards nonverbal cues for men. It is more common in women because sexual, sometimes offensive, verbal remarks are directed towards women. Men, on the other hand, experience more body evaluation through gazing and other nonverbal cues. Gazing is simply the way in which depict men from an idealized perspective. Men tend to experience this from other men, whereas women experience it from both sexes. The Interpersonal Sexual Objectification Scale (ISOS) is a scale that shows sexual objectification of respondents, both men and women. While experiencing sexual objectification it creates the need to constantly maintain and critique one’s physical appearance. This leads <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> like eating disorders, body shaming, and anxiety. The ISOS scale can be related to objectification theory and sexism. Self-objectification, which {{is the way in which}} we evaluate ourselves, is concentrated more on women. [...] Men typically experience it through media display. [...] The difference is that men typically do not experience the negative effects to the extent that women do.|$|E
2500|$|In this way, Hegel {{intends to}} defend the germ of truth in Kantian dualism against reductive or eliminative {{programs}} like those of materialism and empiricism. Like Plato, with his dualism of soul versus bodily appetites, Kant pursues the mind's ability to question its felt inclinations or appetites and {{to come up with}} a standard of [...] "duty" [...] (or, in Plato's case, [...] "good") which transcends bodily restrictiveness. Hegel preserves this essential Platonic and Kantian concern in the form of infinity going beyond the finite (a process that Hegel in fact relates to [...] "freedom" [...] and the [...] "ought"), the universal going beyond the particular (in the Concept), and Spirit going beyond Nature. And Hegel renders these dualities intelligible by (ultimately) his argument in the [...] "Quality" [...] chapter of the [...] "Science of Logic." [...] The finite has to become infinite in order to achieve reality. The idea of the absolute excludes multiplicity so the subjective and objective must achieve synthesis to become whole. This is because, as Hegel suggests by his introduction of the concept of [...] "reality", what determines itself—rather than depending on its relations <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> for its essential character—is more fully [...] "real" [...] (following the Latin etymology of [...] "real:" [...] more [...] "thing-like") than what does not. Finite things don't determine themselves, because, as [...] "finite" [...] things, their essential character is determined by their boundaries, over against other finite things. So, in order to become [...] "real", they must go beyond their finitude ("finitude is only as a transcending of itself").|$|E
2500|$|Post-structuralism is {{not defined}} {{by a set of}} shared axioms or methodologies, but by an {{emphasis}} on how various aspects of a particular culture, from its most ordinary, everyday material details to its most abstract theories and beliefs, determine one another. Post-structuralist thinkers reject Reductionism and Epiphenomenalism and the idea that cause-and-effect relationships are top-down or bottom-up. Like structuralists, they start from the assumption that people's identities, values and economic conditions determine each other rather than having intrinsic properties that can be understood in isolation.Lévi-Strauss, quoting D'Arcy Westworth Thompson states: [...] "To those who question the possibility of defining the interrelations between entities whose nature is not completely understood, I shall reply with the following comment by a great naturalist: In a very large part of morphology, our essential task lies in the comparison of related forms rather than in the precise definition of each; and the deformation of a complicated figure may be a phenomenon easy of comprehension, though the figure itself has to be left unanalyzed and undefined." [...] Thus the French structuralists considered themselves to be espousing Relativism and Constructionism. But they nevertheless tended to explore how the subjects of their study might be described, reductively, as a set of essential relationships, schematics, or mathematical symbols. (An example is Claude Lévi-Strauss's algebraic formulation of mythological transformation in [...] "The Structural Study of Myth"Lévi-Strauss, Claude. Structural Anthropology. Trans. Claire Jacobson and Brooke Grundfest Schoepf (New York: Basic Books, 1963), [...]). Post-structuralists thinkers went further, questioning the existence of any distinction between the nature of a thing and its relationship <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>things.</b>|$|E
