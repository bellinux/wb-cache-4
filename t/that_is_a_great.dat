2500|$|Following the TNI investigation, Prabowo {{acknowledged}} {{responsibility for}} the kidnapping of the activists. He was discharged from military service in August. He and Wiranto denied that the discharge {{was a result of}} disciplinary action. In August 1998, the Dewan Kehormatan Perwira (Officers Council of Honor) tried, and found Prabowo guilty of [...] "misinterpreting orders" [...] in the kidnapping of anti-Suharto activists in 1998. He was discharged from military services, and went into a voluntary exile in Jordan where he knew that country's new young King Abdullah as a fellow commander of special forces. In an interview for Asia Now in 2000, Prabowo said [...] "I never threatened Habibie. I was not behind the riots. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> lie. I never betrayed Pak Harto. I never betrayed Habibie. I never betrayed my country...There was a certain group that wanted to make me a scapegoat, maybe to hide their involvement."" [...] Rights groups have long questioned Prabowo's eligibility to run for president, noting that he was discharged dishonourably from the Army in August 1998 for [...] "misinterpreting orders" [...] in the abduction of the democracy activists. While that was the military's official statement, observers have long believed that it was a coup conspiracy that saw Prabowo, then the commander of the Army Strategic Reserves, given his marching orders.|$|E
2500|$|The blower {{encountered}} in sinking Saltom pit was described to the Royal Society by Lowther, who sought {{suggestions on how}} to deal with firedamp in his pits. A major release had taken place on breaking through a layer of black stone into one of the higher coal seams. Ignited with a candle, it had given a steady flame [...] "about half a Yard in Diameter, and near two Yards high" [...] The flame being extinguished, and a wider penetration through the black stone made, re-ignition of the gas gave a bigger flame, a yard in diameter and about three yards high which was only extinguished with difficulty. The blower was panelled off from the shaft, and piped to the surface where over two and a half years later it continued as fast as ever, filling a large bladder in a few seconds. The Society members elected Sir James a Fellow, but were unable to come up with any solution, or improve on the assertion (eventually found to be incorrect) of Carlisle Spedding, the paper's author, that [...] "this sort of Vapour, or damp Air, will not take Fire except by Flame; Sparks do not affect it, and for that Reason it is frequent to use Flint and Steel in Places affected with this sort of Damp, which will give a glimmering Light, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> Help to the Workmen in difficult Cases." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle, however, {{challenged}} the film's high praise by saying [...] "there {{should be no}} need to pretend There Will Be Blood is a masterpiece just because Anderson sincerely {{tried to make it}} one." [...] Some critics were positive toward the work but less laudatory, often criticizing its ending. Roger Ebert assigned the film three and a half out of four stars and wrote, [...] "There Will Be Blood is the kind of film that is easily called great. I am not sure of its greatness. It was filmed in the same area of Texas used by No Country for Old Men, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> film, and a perfect one. But There Will Be Blood is not perfect, and in its imperfections (its unbending characters, its lack of women or any reflection of ordinary society, its ending, its relentlessness) we may see its reach exceeding its grasp." [...] Carla Meyer of the Sacramento Bee, who gave the film the same star rating as Ebert, opined that the final confrontation between Daniel and Eli marked when the work [...] "stops being a masterpiece and becomes a really good movie. What was grand becomes petty, then overwrought." [...] In 2014, Peter Walker of The Guardian likewise argued that the scene [...] "might not be the very worst scene in the history of recent Oscar-garlanded cinema [...] but it’s perhaps the one most inflated with its own delusional self-importance." ...|$|E
