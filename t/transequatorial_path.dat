40|$|Nighttime ionospheric D-region {{parameters}} {{are found to}} be generally well-modeled by the traditional H ' and as used by Wait and by the US Navy in their Earth-ionosphere VLF radio waveguide programs. New comparisons with non-equatorial, mainly all-sea VLF path observations reported over several decades are shown to be consistent with the previously determined height H ' ~ 85. 0 km and sharpness ~ 0. 63 km- 1. These paths include NPM (Hawaii) to Washington DC, Omega Hawaii and NLK (Seattle) to Japan, NWC (N. W. Australia) to Madagascar and NBA (Panama) to Colorado. In marked contrast, <b>transequatorial</b> <b>path</b> observations (even when nearly all-sea) {{are found to be}} often not well-modeled: for example, for Omega Japan and JJI (Japan) to Dunedin, New Zealand, the observed amplitudes are markedly lower than those which would be expected from H ' ~ 85. 0 km and ~ 0. 63 km- 1, or any other realistic values of H ' and. Other transequatorial observations compared with modeling include NWC to Japan, Omega Hawaii to Dunedin, and NPM (Hawaii) to Dunedin. It is suggested that the effects of irregularities in the equatorial electrojet may extend down into the nighttime D-region and so account for the observed equatorial VLF perturbations through scattering or mode conversion. ...|$|E
40|$|Very low {{frequency}} (VLF) signals from navigational transmitters propagate through the Earth-ionosphere waveguide {{formed by the}} Earth and the lower conducting ionosphere and show the pronounced minima during solar terminator transition between transmitter and receiver. Pronounced amplitude minima observed on 19. 8 kHz (NWC transmitter) and 24. 8 kHz (NLK transmitter) signals recorded at Suva (18. 149 °S, 178. 446 °E), Fiji, during 2013 – 2014, {{have been used to}} estimate the VLF modal interference distance (DMS) and nighttime D region VLF reflection height (hN). The NWC transmitter signal propagates mostly in west-east direction, and the NLK transmitter follows a <b>transequatorial</b> <b>path</b> propagating significantly in the east-west direction. The values of DMS calculated using midpath terminator speed are 2103 ± 172 km and 2507 ± 373 km for these paths having west-east and east-west components of VLF subionospheric propagation, respectively, which agree with previously published results and within 10 % with theoretical values. We have also compared the DMS estimated using a terminator time method with that calculated using terminator speed for a particular day and found both the values to be consistent. The hN values were found to be maximum during winter of Southern Hemisphere for NWC signal and winter of Northern Hemisphere for NLK signal VLF propagation paths to Suva. The hN also shows significant day-to-day and seasonal variabilities with a maximum of about 10 km and 23 km for NWC and NLK signal propagation paths, respectively, which could be due to the atmospheric gravity waves associated with solar terminator transition, as well as meteorological factors such as strong lightnings...|$|E
25|$|Even {{in times}} of solar minimum, when F2 is rarely available, 10 meters still has some long {{distance}} possibilities. Sporadic E propagation can bring in signals from a hundred to many thousands of miles away. Sporadic E on 10 meters is mainly a seasonal event, with late {{spring and early summer}} being prime time for the mode. A shorter, less-intense period occurs during mid-winter, often between Christmas and the new year. Other, off-peak openings may be seen almost anytime. Even during solar minimum, F2 openings often occur on <b>transequatorial</b> <b>paths,</b> for example between Europe and Southern Africa or between Pacific North America and the Eastern Pacific islands.|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{was made of}} modal interference patterns observed during sunrise transitions on <b>transequatorial</b> propagation <b>paths</b> where the receiver was south and west of the transmitter. The phase difference, at the receiver, between the interfering modes was obtained {{as a function of}} the distance of the sunrise line along the path from the transmitter, and was found to have a turning point when the sunrise line was in the vicinity of the magnetic equator. This tended to confirm the existence of an equatorial anomaly, as suggested by Lynn, in VLF propagation on such paths. The analysis suggested that there was a reduction in the phase velocity of the second order mode while propagating through the equatorial region, the phase velocity of the first order mode remaining essentially unaltered...|$|R
