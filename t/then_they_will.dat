5|$|Curves {{that have}} self-crossings may reach {{singularities}} before contracting to a point. For instance, if a lemniscate (any smooth immersed curve {{with a single}} crossing, resembling a figure 8 or infinity symbol) has unequal areas in its two lobes, then eventually the smaller lobe will collapse to a point. However, if the two lobes have equal areas, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> remain equal throughout {{the evolution of the}} curve, and the isoperimetric ratio will diverge as the curve collapses to a singularity.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{have argued}} that {{cognitive}} flexibility is also a component of multiple classification, as originally described by psychologist Jean Piaget. In multiple classification tasks, participants (primarily children, who have already developed or {{are in the process}} of developing this skill) must classify objects in several different ways at once - thereby thinking flexibly about them. Similarly, in order to be cognitively flexible they must overcome centration, which is the tendency for young children to solely focus on one aspect of an object or situation. For example, when children are young they may be solely able to focus on one aspect of an object (i.e. color of object), and be unable to focus on both aspects (i.e. both color and kind of object). Thus, research suggests if an individual is centrated in their thinking, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> be more cognitively inflexible.|$|E
5|$|Charles Onyett of IGN {{found the}} {{gameplay}} enjoyable and {{enough to be}} appreciated by any genre fan. Yet he stated that if players were not Dragon Ball fans, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> not {{want to play the}} game. Robert Thompson of Nintendojo felt that the game would satisfy fans of both the series and the genre, but he would complain about the ki and Sparking Combo attacks being repetitive, and the story shifting control of the characters, stating it could make unfamiliar gamers disoriented. Ryan Olsen of Kombo.com praised the battle system, calling it more engaging than the ones found in the average RPG. Still he would call the game a cut and dry RPG, calling the Active Guard system the only exotic aspect of the game. Neal Ronaghan of Nintendo World Report called the game vanilla with an interesting twists, stating that the fans should be the ones playing the game. He also drew comparisons of the Active Guard system to the Timed Hit system from Super Mario RPG, and Rage Gage to the Limit Break from Final Fantasy. Brittany Vincent of RPGFan would call side quests like Krillin's return home an added treat to the long story. She pointed out the game's difficulty being frustrating, stating that the game will cause players to revert to the start screen many times, yet is still beatable.|$|E

5|$|Shapiro {{responds}} to Goodin's argument by challenging his factual assumption that individuals would starve if they refused the workfare throffer. In state-sponsored (see welfare state) workfare systems, he claims, only monetary assistance is eliminated by {{a refusal to}} accept the throffer, while in private systems (that is, non-state charities or organisations offering conditional aid), other groups than the one operating a workfare system exist. In either system, recipients of welfare may also turn {{to family and friends}} for help. For these reasons, he does not consider the throffer to be unrefusable in the cases in which Goodin believes it is. A second (and, Shapiro claims, more important) objection is also presented. State welfare without sanctions fails to mirror the way that working individuals who do not rely on welfare payments take responsibility for their lives. If a person who works stops working, Shapiro observes, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> typically find their economic situation worsened. Unconditional state welfare does not reflect this, and instead reflects the unusual position of the person who would be no worse off if they refused to work. As unconditional welfare does not mirror the situation of ordinary workers, it is unable {{to determine whether or not}} people are willing to take responsibility for their lives.|$|E

25|$|These {{ideas have}} {{affected}} many thinkers after Fiske, {{but he has}} also been critiqued as being too utopian, and as not providing enough agency for the audiences he describes.

25|$|Expectancy theory posits {{employee}} satisfaction to be {{an outcome}} of performance rather than the cause of performance.

25|$|Moreover, in {{contrast}} to classical mechanics, it is unavoidable that performing a measurement on the system generally changes its state. More precisely: After measuring an observable A, the system will be in an eigenstate of A; thus the state has changed, unless the system was already in that eigenstate. This expresses a kind of logical consistency: If we measure A twice in the same run of the experiment, the measurements being directly consecutive in time, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> produce the same results. This has some strange consequences, however, as follows.|$|E
25|$|The fully {{polynomial}} time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for the knapsack problem {{takes advantage of}} the fact that the reason the problem has no known {{polynomial time}} solutions is because the profits associated with the items are not restricted. If one rounds off some of the least significant digits of the profit values <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> be bounded by a polynomial and 1/ε where ε is a bound on the correctness of the solution. This restriction then means that an algorithm can find a solution in polynomial time that is correct within a factor of (1-ε) of the optimal solution.|$|E

25|$|Producers will {{typically}} {{continue to}} milk the cow until she is two {{months away from}} parturition <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> dry her off. Giving the cow a break during {{the final stages of}} pregnancy allows her mammary gland to regress and re-develop, her body condition to recover, and the calf to develop normally. Decreased body condition in the cow means she will not be as productive in subsequent milk cycles. Decreased health in the new born calf will negatively impact the quality of the replacement herd. There is also evidence that increased rates of mammary cell proliferation occur during the dry period that is essential to maintaining high production levels in subsequent lactation cycles.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{return of}} the man's family on the given date, they will pay the bride-price and bring along gifts of {{offering}} such as livestock and alcoholic beverages, iswazi, to be drunk by {{the family of the}} bride.

These include slaughtering of the livestock as a grateful gesture to their ancestors as well as pouring a considerable amount of the alcoholic beverages on the ground of the bride's household to give thanks to their ancestors. The groom's family is then welcomed into the family and traditional beer, Umqombothi, will be prepared for the groom's family as a token of appreciation from the bride's family.|$|E
25|$|The Judges {{themselves}} are not exempt from the law; in fact {{they are expected to}} obey it more strictly than any other. A violation that would earn a citizen a few months in an Iso-Cube would get a Judge a twenty-year sentence, served as hard labor on Saturn's moon, Titan, after surgical modification to enable the convict to survive outside there without needing an expensive space suit. (Titan is a moon of Saturn in reality, but was located over Jupiter in an early Dredd strip.) When Judges do make a minor mistake (anything were the citizen is alive or not in an intensive care ward) such as wrongful arrest or search they do have to pay the citizen a compensation fee if there is no crimes to be charged with. On that basis, if they can't find any evidence for the main charge, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> look for any minor crime or misdemeanours to charge to citizen with to get themselves off the hook.|$|E
