The way I would perform songs was always about the lyrics and always about <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to everybody and make them watch and believe what I'm saying and I suppose I'm essentially doing that here but I'm not looking at the audience I'm obviously looking at the other actors.|$|E
500|$|Jennings {{had invited}} the then unknown Billy Joe Shaver to Nashville {{to write the}} songs for his next album after hearing him sing [...] "Willy the Wandering Gypsy and Me" [...] just before the 1972 Dripping Springs Reunion. [...] When Shaver got to Nashville he spent six months unsuccessfully <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> with Jennings, who had {{apparently}} forgotten the invite. Eventually, {{with the help of}} local D.J. Roger [...] "Captain Midnight" [...] Schutt, Shaver turned up at a RCA recording session Jennings was doing with producer Chet Atkins, and tried to confront the singer, who merely offered Shaver $100. Shaver refused the money and told Jennings {{that he was willing to}} fight him if he would not listen to his songs. In the 2003 documentary Beyond Nashville, Shaver recalls: ...|$|E
500|$|On 24 November 2008, Fox News' On the Record aired an {{interview}} with Van der Sloot {{in which he said}} that he sold Holloway into sexual slavery, receiving money both when Holloway was taken, and later on to keep quiet. He also alleged that he paid the Kalpoe brothers for their assistance, and that his father Paulus paid off two police officers who had learned that Holloway was taken to Venezuela. Van der Sloot later retracted the statements made in the interview. The show also aired part of an audio recording provided by Van der Sloot, which he alleged is a phone conversation between him and Paulus, in which Paulus displays knowledge of his son's purported involvement in human trafficking. According to Mos, the voice heard on the recording was not that of Paulus van der Sloot. The Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf reported that the [...] "father's" [...] voice is almost certainly that of Joran himself, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> in a lower tone.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{the book}} Women in Parliament {{published}} in 2005, Soames has been named as the 'most sexist' MP, with several female MPs stating {{that he has made}} vulgar comments to them. In other accusations of sexual harassment, it has been alleged that Soames makes repeated cupping gestures with his hands, suggestive of female breasts, when women are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> in parliament, in order to distract them. He allegedly harassed Alastair Campbell by telephoning him and saying [...] "you sex god, you Adonis, you the greatest of all great men". However, unknown to Soames, he was actually speaking to Campbell's young son.|$|E
2500|$|In Slovenian, {{there are}} two {{concurrent}} standard accentual systems — the older, tonal, with three [...] "pitch accents", and younger, dynamic (i.e. stress-based), with louder and longer syllables. The stress-based system was introduced because two thirds of Slovenia does not have tonal accent anymore. In practice, however, even the stress-based accentual system is just an abstract ideal and speakers generally retain their own organic idiom even when <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> standard Slovenian (e.g. the speakers of urban idioms at the west of Slovenia which don't have distinctive lengths don't introduce that kind of quantitative opposition when speaking the standard language).|$|E
