5|$|In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges {{published}} {{the results of}} a cladistic analysis of morphological characters of Banksia. They retained George's subgenera and many of his series, but discarded his sections. George's B.ser. Tetragonae was found to be monophyletic, and therefore retained; and <b>their</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the relationships within the series supported the placement of B.aculeata alongside B.caleyi.|$|E
5|$|In a 1978 {{classification}} {{of the genus}} Clavaria, Ronald Petersen placed C.zollingeri in the subgenus Clavaria, a grouping of species with clamp connections absent from all septa in the fruit body; others in the subgenus included C.purpurea, C.fumosa, and the type, C.vermicularis. A large-scale molecular analysis of the phylogenetic distributions and limits of clavarioid fungi in the family Clavariaceae was published by Bryn Dentiger and David McLaughlin in 2006. Based on <b>their</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> ribosomal DNA sequences, C.zollingeri shared the greatest genetic similarity with Clavulinopsis laeticolor. Petersen's concept of the infrageneric {{classification of}} Clavaria was largely rejected in this analysis, as {{two of the three}} subgenera he proposed were found to be polyphyletic.|$|E
5|$|Stevens {{was very}} active in working with Latina feminists through the CIM. At the Seventh Pan-American Conference, held in 1933 in Montevideo, Uruguay, the women {{presented}} <b>their</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> {{the legal status of}} women in each of the 21 member countries. The first report ever to study in detail the civil and political rights of women, it had been prepared solely by women. They proposed a Treaty on the Equality of Rights for Women, and it was rejected by the conference, though it was signed by Cuba, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Three of those states had already granted suffrage to women, and none of the four ratified the Treaty after the conference. However, the women had presented the first international resolution to recommend suffrage for women. Next, Stevens presented their materials which showed the disparity between rights of men and women. For example, in 16 countries of the Americas women could not vote at all, in two countries they could vote with restrictions, and in three countries they had equal enfranchisement. In 19 of the American countries, women did not have equal custody over their children, including in seven US states, and only two countries allowed joint authority for women of their own children. None of the Latin American countries allowed women to serve on juries, and 27 US states prohibited women from participating in juries. Divorce grounds in 14 countries and 28 states were disparate for men and women, and a woman could not administer her own separate property in 13 countries and two US states.|$|E

50|$|Unwittingly, Eliot {{inspired}} and informed {{the movement of}} New Criticism. This is somewhat ironic, since he later criticised <b>their</b> intensely detailed <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> texts as unnecessarily tedious. Yet, he does share with them the same focus on the aesthetic and stylistic qualities of poetry, rather than on its ideological content. The New Critics resemble Eliot in <b>their</b> close <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> particular passages and poems.|$|R
25|$|Leonhard Euler, Daniel Bernoulli, and Patrick d'Arcy all {{understood}} {{angular momentum}} {{in terms of}} conservation of areal velocity, a result of <b>their</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> Kepler's Second Law of planetary motion. It is unlikely that they realized the implications for ordinary rotating matter.|$|E
25|$|The book {{includes}} the authors' calculation of average IQ scores for 60 countries, based on <b>their</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> published reports. It reports their observation that national IQ correlates with {{gross domestic product}} per capita at 0.82, and with the rate of economic growth from 1950–1990 at 0.64.|$|E
25|$|The Wound Data and Munitions Effectiveness Team (WDMET) {{gathered}} data on wounds sustained {{during the}} Vietnam War. In <b>their</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> this data {{published in the}} Textbook of Military Medicine, Ronald Bellamy and Russ Zajtchuck point {{out a number of}} cases which seem to be examples of distant injuries. Bellamy and Zajtchuck describe three mechanisms of distant wounding due to pressure transients: 1) stress waves 2) shear waves and 3) a vascular pressure impulse.|$|E

25|$|After the {{destruction}} of the Buddhas, 50 caves were revealed. In 12 of the caves, wall paintings were discovered. In December 2004, an international team of researchers stated the wall paintings at Bamiyan were painted between the 5th and the 9th centuries, rather than the 6th to 8th centuries, citing <b>their</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> radioactive isotopes contained in straw fibers found beneath the paintings. It is believed that the paintings were done by artists travelling on the Silk Road, the trade route between China and the West.|$|E
25|$|In their {{research}} {{there were only}} two players who had a significantly lower number of runs than expected by chance. No shooter had significantly more runs than would be expected by chance. About half of the shooters (12 of 23 = 52%) had fewer runs than expected, and about half (11 of 23 = 48%) had more runs than expected. The researchers also compared the shooters hits and misses. The data were more in accordance with chance than the hot hand. Through <b>their</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the data the conclusion was drawn that there was nothing that supported the hot hand hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|The {{defeat of}} the {{plebiscite}} came as a great surprise to most commentators because few had predicted that it would fail. The Labor movement, and the 'anti' cause in general, had fought under many disadvantages, and the 'yes' campaign had most of the media, many major public institutions, {{and many of the}} state governments on its side. Supporters of the referendum were circumspect in <b>their</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the result, noting that only a few percentage points and fewer than 75,000 voters had separated the results. The support for the vote in Victoria was surprising to many, given that it had often been the locus of anti-conscription rhetoric.|$|E

50|$|In <b>their</b> {{controversial}} <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> {{the contemporary}} western society, Dialectic of Enlightenment (1944, revised 1947), Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer developed a wider, and more pessimistic concept <b>of</b> enlightenment. In <b>their</b> <b>analysis,</b> enlightenment had its dark side: {{while trying to}} abolish superstition and myths by 'foundationalist' philosophy, it ignored its own 'mythical' basis. Its strivings towards totality and certainty led to an increasing instrumentalization of reason.|$|R

25|$|After quelling much public discontent, Starways Congress {{finishes}} <b>their</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> {{the situation}} while the fleet is en route. Fearing the Descolada virus, further rebellions by colony worlds, and other possible unknown political motives, Starways Congress attempts to relay {{an order to}} the fleet to annihilate Lusitania upon arrival. After conferring with friends on whether a cause is worth dying for, Jane (a compassionate AI living in the interstellar ansible communication network) shuts off transmissions to the fleet to block the order. As a consequence of this action, she risks her eventual discovery and death, should the government shut down and wipe the interplanetary network. No known smaller computer system can house her consciousness.|$|E
25|$|Osbourne {{experienced}} tremors {{for some}} years and linked them to his continuous drug abuse. In May 2005, he {{found out it was}} actually Parkin syndrome, a genetic condition, the symptoms of which are similar to Parkinson's disease. Osbourne will have to take daily medication {{for the rest of his}} life to combat the involuntary shudders associated with the condition. Osbourne has also shown symptoms of mild hearing loss, as depicted in the television show, The Osbournes, where he often asks his family to repeat what they say. At the TEDMED Conference in October 2010, scientists from Knome joined Osbourne on stage to discuss <b>their</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> Osbourne's whole genome, which shed light on how the famously hard-living rocker has survived decades of drug abuse.|$|E
25|$|Kurowski's {{works were}} {{published}} in Germany since 1958, but remained inaccessible to English-speaking audiences. J.J. Fedorowicz Publishing, whom Smelser and Davies describe as a leading publisher of war-romancing literature, released Kurowski's two popular works, Panzer Aces and Infantry Aces, in the U.S. in 1992 and 1994. In <b>their</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the series, which also included Panzer Aces II and Panzer Aces III, Smelser and Davies write:Kurowski gives the readers an almost heroic version of the German soldier, guiltless of any war crimes, actually incapable of such behavior. (...) Sacrifice and humility are his hallmarks. Their actions win them medals, badges and promotions, yet they remain indifferent to these awards. The cover art evokes heroism, determination and might of the German soldier and his weapons.|$|E
50|$|The {{expertise}} of the historians in the searching process and <b>their</b> resulting <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the records was a major contribution to public understanding of World War II war crimes and the involvement of U.S. agencies relating to those charged or suspected of war crimes.|$|R

To perform analysis, following tasks were accomplished: detailed description of used auto-oscillatory models, their properties and factors affecting <b>their</b> behaviour, <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the spread of excitation in a nerve fibre, <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> mathematical models of cardiac and skeletal muscle fibres, <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> behaviour of skeletal muscle cells from mechanical point of view...|$|R
25|$|Prior {{to their}} own Colonial War the Portuguese {{military}} had studied French and British efforts in Indo-China, Algeria and Malaya (Cann, 1997). Based on <b>their</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> operations in those theatres and considering their own situation in Africa, the Portuguese military took the unusual decision to restructure their entire armed forces, from top to bottom, for counterinsurgency. This transformation did, however, take seven years to complete and only took its final form in 1968. By 1974, the counterinsurgency efforts were successful in the Portuguese territories of Angola and Mozambique, but in Portuguese Guinea the local guerrillas were making progress. As the conflict escalated, the Portuguese authorities developed progressively tougher responses, these included the Gordian Knot Operation and the Operation Green Sea.|$|E
25|$|Hughes {{accepted}} {{the decision of}} the voters, despite calls from some newspapers and supporters to push ahead with the introduction of conscription regardless of the result. The men who had been called up and whom had reported would be free to return home upon a month of training. In <b>their</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the failure of the poll, Hughes and Pearce calculated that, assuming a consistent bloc of support from the Commonwealth Liberal Party, about half of the Labor movement had stuck with Hughes at the polls, and half had defected to defeat the referendum, in concert with other narrower demographic groups such as farmers, pacifists and the Irish. Through the operations of his colleagues during the two-week interlude between the failure of the vote and the break-up of the party, Hughes was aware that the Labor Party was conspiring to rid themselves of him at the first opportune moment, presumably after the settlement of the coalminers' industrial dispute.|$|E
25|$|Research {{projects}} {{designed to}} test Freud's theories empirically {{have led to}} a vast literature on the topic. Seymour Fisher and Roger P. Greenberg concluded in 1977 that some of Freud's concepts were supported by empirical evidence. <b>Their</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> research literature supported Freud's concepts of oral and anal personality constellations, his account of the role of Oedipal factors in certain aspects of male personality functioning, his formulations about the relatively greater concern about loss of love in women's as compared to men's personality economy, and his views about the instigating effects of homosexual anxieties on the formation of paranoid delusions. They also found limited and equivocal support for Freud's theories about the development of homosexuality. They found that several of Freud's other theories, including his portrayal of dreams as primarily containers of secret, unconscious wishes, {{as well as some of}} his views about the psychodynamics of women, were either not supported or contradicted by research. Reviewing the issues again in 1996, they concluded that much experimental data relevant to Freud's work exists, and supports some of his major ideas and theories.|$|E
