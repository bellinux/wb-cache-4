5|$|By the 19th century, Victorian {{scholars}} such as William Stubbs, James Ramsay, and William Hunt {{sought to}} understand how the English political system had evolved under Henry. They explored the emergence of Parliamentary institutions during his reign, and sympathized with the concerns of the chroniclers over the role of the Poitevins in England. This focus carried on into early 20th-century research into Henry, such as Kate Norgate's 1913 volume, which continued <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>heavy</b> use of the chronicler accounts and focused primarily on constitutional issues, with a distinctive nationalistic bias.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} by Takumi Nakazawa, while Kotaro Uchikoshi was the planner and scenario writer. Development began immediately after Uchikoshi's first visual novel, Memories Off, was finished. He was unable <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>heavy</b> use of science fiction themes in Never 7, as his superiors at KID {{told him that the}} game needed to include cute girl characters in order to sell; he kept science fiction themes light, and the game was designed with a focus on dating game elements, with the main focus being to develop a relationship with a girl. The Dreamcast version included new scenarios not available in the PlayStation version.|$|E
5|$|The first geared {{clock was}} invented in the 11th century by the Arab {{engineer}} Ibn Khalaf al-Muradi in Islamic Iberia; it was a water clock that employed a complex gear train mechanism, including both segmental and epicyclic gearing, capable of transmitting high torque. The clock was unrivalled in its use of sophisticated complex gearing, until the mechanical clocks of the mid-14th century. Al-Muradi's clock also employed the use of mercury in its hydraulic linkages, which could function mechanical automata. Al-Muradi's work was known to scholars working under Alfonso X of Castile, hence the mechanism {{may have played a}} role in the development of the European mechanical clocks. Other monumental water clocks constructed by medieval Muslim engineers also employed complex gear trains and arrays of automata. Like the earlier Greeks and Chinese, Arab engineers at the time also developed a liquid-driven escapement mechanism which they employed in some of their water clocks. Heavy floats were used as weights and a constant-head system was used as an escapement mechanism, which was present in the hydraulic controls they used <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>heavy</b> floats descend at a slow and steady rate.|$|E
50|$|Research {{has shown}} that one can {{distinguish}} between hard science and soft science disciplines based {{on the level of}} graph use, so {{it can be argued that}} there is a correlation between scientificity and visuality. Furthermore, natural sciences publications appear <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>heavier</b> use of graphs than mathematical and social sciences.|$|R

5|$|Schumacher was {{the fastest}} driver not {{to advance to}} the final session, {{qualifying}} eleventh; his best time of 1:15.026 was nearly two seconds slower than Alonso's fastest time in the second session. He had been one tenth of a second quicker than his teammate Rosberg in the first session; Rosberg's lap caused Schumacher to be eliminated from qualifying and the latter stated he had brake problems. Kamui Kobayashi qualified in 12th after he encountered slower cars which forced him to reduce his speed, and his tyre temperatures dropped which resulted in a loss of grip. He was followed by Petrov in the 13th position. Sutil was afflicted with a lack of grip in his Force India which caused him to slide sideways. However Sutil was penalised five positions because this team changed his gearbox following his driveshaft failure in the final practice session. As a result, de la Rosa inherited 14th, and was ahead of the Toro Rosso drivers (Jaime Alguersuari in front of Buemi). Jarno Trulli was the quickest driver who was unable to advance beyond the first part of qualifying, and was followed by his Lotus teammate Heikki Kovalainen. Timo Glock was penalised five positions on the grid twice because his team changed his gearbox and fitted a seventh-gear ratio that went undeclared on Friday. Senna took over the 20th place. Liuzzi exited turn 15 to complete his second timed lap, ran over a wet patch of astroturf causing him to lose control of the back-end of his Force India, sending him across the track <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>heavy</b> contact with the front of his car. He veered back towards the track and some grass and narrowly avoided collecting Glock. Sakon Yamamoto had a shifting issue on his fastest lap time and took 23rd. Lucas di Grassi had a gearbox problem in his car that was unable to be rectified and completed the field. He was later given a five-place grid penalty for the gearbox change but it had no effect on his starting position.|$|E

After they accidentally meet under less-than-friendly circumstances, Juan and John involuntarily become heroes of the Revolution despite being forced <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>heavy</b> sacrifices.|$|E
60|$|To {{what have}} we seen men of prodigious bulk in trade reduced--as Sir Thomas Cook, Sir Basil Firebrass, Sheppard, Coggs, and innumerable bankers, money-scriveners, and merchants, who thought {{themselves}} as secure against the shocks of trade, as any {{men in the world}} could be? Not to instance our late South Sea directors, and others, reduced by the terrible fate of bubbles, whose names I omit because they yet live, though sinking still under the oppression of their fortunes, and whose weight I would be far from endeavouring <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>heavier.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{substantial}} {{damage caused}} by the air raid of 14th November 1940 finally led to the tramway system being completely abandoned. It was later reported that the 2700 tons of material salvaged from the tramway track was sufficient <b>to</b> <b>make</b> 180 <b>heavy</b> tanks.|$|R
25|$|The second {{report was}} shorter. It {{recommended}} that Hans von Halban and Lew Kowarski should {{move to the}} U.S. where there were plans <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>heavy</b> water on a large scale. Plutonium might be more suitable than uranium-235, and plutonium research should continue in Britain. It concluded that the controlled fission of uranium {{could be used to}} generate heat energy for use in machines, and provide large quantities of radioisotopes which could be used as substitutes for radium. Heavy water or possibly graphite might serve as moderator for the fast neutrons. In conclusion though, while the nuclear reactor had considerable promise for future peaceful uses, the committee felt that it was not worth considering during the present war.|$|E
25|$|After {{five years}} of non stop {{recording}} and touring and having lost touch with reality, the band {{decided to take a}} sabbatical in 1997. They worked on some demos in January 1998, but did not find the band dynamics revitalized, and the trio decided to split up on 10 March 1998 when discussing the future of the band on a bench in the Rosenborg Castle Gardens. The split occurred amidst a wave of prominent Danish bands disbanding. Critics would later explain their decision as the band having the courage to stop in time despite enormous success, although it was largely due to fatigue that the trio could not bring themselves to continuing to play. Their tastes in music had also become less compatible, with Christensen wanting a more vintage Beatles-like sound and Nielsen and Friis preferring <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>heavy</b> metal music.|$|E
25|$|Mark Winterbottom won the Jason Richards Memorial Trophy after {{dominating}} {{the weekend in}} New Zealand. The 2013 Jason Richards Memorial Trophy winner, Jason Bright, started the event strongly by taking pole for the first race and going on to win after early leader Jamie Whincup had steering problems. Shane Van Gisbergen and Craig Lowndes completed the podium, while David Wall was put out {{for the rest of}} the weekend after contact with Chaz Mostert at the final corner caused his car <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>heavy</b> contact with the wall. Winterbottom won the first of the Saturday races ahead of polesitter James Courtney and Mostert. Van Gisbergen won the second Saturday race, holding off a late charge from Winterbottom, with Scott McLaughlin in third after starting from pole. McLaughlin again took pole for the Sunday race but was beaten by Winterbottom in the race, with Mostert finishing third for the second time during the weekend. Tim Slade had qualified on the front row, but his car had a clutch problem on the formation lap, causing an aborted start and forcing him to start from the pit lane. With Lowndes struggling during the weekend, Winterbottom left the event with a 107-point lead in the championship.|$|E

Uchikoshi included science fiction elements in the game, but was unable <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>heavy</b> use of use them, as his superiors at KID thought that the game needed to focus on cute female characters in order to sell. Abo composed music based on his first impressions of reading the game's story, {{with a focus on}} its [...] "emotional flow". Because of the science fiction and theoretical themes, he composed [...] "geometric music".|$|E
500|$|Basic {{object-oriented}} programming functionality was added in PHP 3 and improved in PHP 4. This allowed for PHP to gain further abstraction, making creative tasks easier for programmers using the language. Object handling was completely rewritten for PHP 5, expanding the feature set and enhancing performance. In previous versions of PHP, objects were handled like value types. The drawback {{of this method}} was that code had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>heavy</b> use of PHP's [...] "reference" [...] variables if it wanted to modify an object it was passed rather than creating a copy of it. In the new approach, objects are referenced by handle, and not by value.|$|E
500|$|Boys' Ranch {{has become}} one of Simon and Kirby's most {{critically}} acclaimed creations and is held in high esteem by both creators. R. J. Vitone qualifies the series as having [...] "much more depth than previous S & K kid-gang strips– the basic elements that had made the romance and crime books so thematically strong were applied here as well." [...] Mendryk points out a certain drop of quality in later issues: [...] "It was part of the Simon and Kirby modus operandi <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>heavy</b> use of Kirby’s talents in the early issues of a new title and afterwards make more frequent use of other artists. For Boys' Ranch the change seems much more dramatic then in other titles. The last three issues are good, but they are not the masterpieces that the earlier issues were." ...|$|E

2500|$|Brabham {{briefly and}} unsuccessfully campaigned his own second hand Formula One Maserati 250F during 1956, but his season was saved by drives for Cooper in sports cars and Formula Two, the junior {{category}} to Formula One. At that time, almost all racing cars had their engines mounted {{at the front}} but Coopers were different, having the engine placed behind the driver, which improved their handling. In 1957, Brabham drove another mid-engined Cooper, again only fitted with a 2-litre engine, at the Monaco Grand Prix. He avoided a large crash at the first corner and was running third {{towards the end of}} the race when the fuel pump mount failed. After more than three hours of racing, the exhausted Brabham, who [...] "hated to be beaten", pushed the car to the line to finish sixth. The following year, he was Autocar Formula Two champion in a Cooper, while continuing to score minor points-scoring positions with the small-engined Coopers in the World Drivers' Championship and driving for Aston Martin in Sportscars. His schedule necessitated a considerable amount of travel on the roads of Europe. Brabham's driving on public roads was described as [...] "safe as houses", unlike many of his contemporaries—on the way back from the 1957 Pescara Grand Prix, passenger Tony Brooks took over driving after Brabham refused to overtake a long line of lorries. In late 1958, Brabham rekindled his interest in flying and began taking lessons. He bought his own plane and on gaining his licence began <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>heavy</b> use of it piloting himself, his family, and members of his team around Europe to races.|$|E
