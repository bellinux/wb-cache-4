5|$|Alright, {{the main}} titles. Why the change? As you'll see here, the {{previous}} titles {{were such a}} high school aesthetic. It would have felt silly {{for me to go}} back to college with the same sort of look—the notebook paper. So it felt like we needed to change for college anyway. And in season one when we first did <b>the</b> <b>titles,</b> the network was very clear on wanting to sell it as a high school show rather than a noir show. But once we went to college and had a chance to redo <b>the</b> <b>titles</b> I wanted it to feel noir. For the new theme song, Thomas asked The Dandy Warhols to commission a remix of their original track, which Thomas reported enjoying upon first listening.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{announcements}} {{concerning the}} three titles, Operation Rainfall {{came into existence}} {{in an effort to}} persuade Nintendo to bring <b>the</b> <b>titles</b> to North America. Xenoblade Chronicles and The Last Story were chosen for their pedigree, while Pandora's Tower was selected due to its unique mechanics {{and the fact that it}} was also published by Nintendo for the Wii. The team also decided on <b>the</b> <b>titles</b> as they were already confirmed for an English release in Europe and had received critical acclaim in Japan, so they avoided trying to push for the release of critically and commercially unsuccessful games such as Earth Seeker. The campaign's title stemmed from the group's wish to inundate Nintendo of America with requests. Beginning in June 2011 on the message boards of gaming site IGN, it was met with support from the gaming community. Its campaign was spread across letters and emails to Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé, in addition to campaigns on Facebook and Twitter. Both physical and digital mediums were chosen for the campaign to make them more obvious and less able to be deleted, as a purely digital campaign would have been. To this end, letters and objects inspired by <b>the</b> <b>titles</b> were sent to Nintendo of America.|$|E
