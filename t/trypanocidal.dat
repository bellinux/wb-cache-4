5000|$|A flea bites an {{infected}} rodent and ingests its blood. Within six hours, the parasites migrate and reproduce in the epithelial cells of their host flea's stomach.

[...] The parasite's metacyclic trypomastigote infects a rat after it eats the host flea or the flea's feces. Once inside the rat's body, the parasite will then begin reproducing epimastigotes in the blood capillaries of the host. After about five days, trypanosomes will begin appearing in the peripheral blood of the host, {{with the appearance of}} thick worms. These parasites are usually attacked by ablastin, a <b>trypanocidal</b> IgG antibody produced by their host's immune system beginning 2-4 days postinfection. After a few weeks, the trypanosomes stop growing and disappear from the bloodstream. The rat then develops immunity against re-infection.|$|E
50|$|GALVmed {{is one of}} {{only two}} British-based {{charities}} supported by the Gates Foundation. In August 2014, Bill Gates visited GALVmed’s Edinburgh office to see and hear first-hand the progress being made by GALVmed. Apart from the completed phase 1 and ongoing phase 2 PLSHL projects, GALVmed conceived and was a partner in the Vaccines for the Control of Neglected Animal Diseases in Africa (VACNADA) project, which ran from 2010 to 2011. The €20million VACNADA project, funded by the European Union Food Facility and with overall coordination of the implementing partners by the African Union-Interafrican Bureau for Animal Resources (AU-IBAR), was an intervention aimed to enhance food security through reducing the impact of animal disease by increasing access to and use of quality vaccines. Other partners included the African Union Panafrican Veterinary Vaccine Centre (AU-PANVAC) and the centre de coopération internationale enrechercheagronomique pour le développement (CIRAD). GALVmed led the implementation of a VACNADA component to improve the capacity of eight African laboratories to make quality assured vaccines in more efficient ways that met internationally recognised quality standards and best practices. Staff from selected national vaccine producing laboratories, identified through a needs assessment, received training in laboratory and vaccine operation management, had their laboratory facilities upgraded and technical support provided for the implementation of quality assurance and standardisation of the production process of selected vaccines. In 2011, DFID awarded GALVmed an additional grant worth £8,010,708 to support the development of an integrated package of tools and policies and implement it as a cost effective control of animal African trypanosomosis (AAT). The objective was to develop a new robust field diagnostic tool for AAT, new <b>trypanocidal</b> drugs and to establish the basis {{for the development of a}} vaccine for AAT. The Controlling AAT project was scheduled to run until February 2014,. The DFID funding for AAT was subsequently complemented by a grant worth US$ 1,421,722 awarded by BMGF in January 2014 to undergo Phase 2 of the project. The stated purpose of the BMGF grant was to develop safe and effective drugs against drug-resistant AAT as well as a diagnostic test for field diagnosis of infection in cattle and to improve the quality control of existing <b>trypanocidal</b> drugs used by smallholder livestock keepers in sub-Saharan Africa.|$|E

40|$|Trypanosomiasis is a {{neglected}} tropical disease with complex clinical manifestations, tedious diagnosis, and difficult treatments.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of new, effective, cheap, and safe drugs for its treatment. Plants are potentially rich sources of leads for new drugs against trypanosomiasis. Vitex simplicifolia (Verbenaceae) is used traditionally {{for the treatment of}} tooth ache, edema, skin diseases, gout and trypanosomiasis in Nigeria.

Sesquiterpenes, a diverse group of natural terpenoids, are found in essential oils of many plants and show a broad range of bioactivities. They act through multiple mechanisms in the chemotherapy of trypanosomiasis. Some of these active compounds contain hydroperoxides, aldehydes, alcohols, α,β-unsaturated γ-lactone and even halogenated moieties. Among the compounds reported, sesquiterpene lactones showed a potent anti-trypanosoma effect comparable with commercial <b>trypanocidal</b> drugs. <b>Trypanocidal</b> activity of sesquiterpene lactones mostly depends on the reaction between γ-lactone moieties and nucleophile groups of trypanithione, which is essential for Trypanosoma defense against the oxidative stresses.
