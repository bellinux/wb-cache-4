50|$|Geocoding is interpolating spatial {{locations}} (X,Y coordinates) from street addresses or {{any other}} spatially referenced data such as ZIP Codes, parcel lots and address locations. A reference theme is required <b>to</b> <b>geocode</b> individual addresses, such as a road centerline file with address ranges. The individual address locations have historically been interpolated, or estimated, by examining address ranges along a road segment. These are usually provided {{in the form of}} a table or database. The software will then place a dot approximately where that address belongs along the segment of centerline. For example, an address point of 500 will be at the midpoint of a line segment that starts with address 1 and ends with address 1,000. Geocoding can also be applied against actual parcel data, typically from municipal tax maps. In this case, the result of the geocoding will be an actually positioned space as opposed to an interpolated point. This approach is being increasingly used to provide more precise location information.|$|E
40|$|Geocoding a study {{population}} {{as completely as possible}} {{is an important}} data assimilation component of many spatial epidemiologic studies. Unfortunately, complete geocoding is rare in practice. The failure of a substantial proportion of study subjects ' addresses <b>to</b> <b>geocode</b> has consequences for spatial analyses, some of which are not yet fully understood. This article explicitly demonstrates that the failure <b>to</b> <b>geocode</b> can be spatially clustered, and it investigates the implications of this for the detection of disease clustering. A dataset of more than 9, 000 ground-truthed addresses from Carroll County, Iowa, which is geocoded via a standard address matching and street interpolation algorithm, is used for this purpose. Through simulation of disease processes at these addresses, the authors show that spatial clustering of geocoding failure has no effect on power to detect spatial disease clustering if the likelihood of disease is independent of the failure <b>to</b> <b>geocode,</b> but that power is substantially reduced if disease likelihood and geocoding failure are positively associated...|$|E

Google Sheets provides advantages not seen in ggmap, because it does not require coding and is a web-based application.

40|$|Geocoding {{has been}} a widely used {{technology}} in daily life and scientific research {{for at least four}} decades. Especially in scientific research, geocoding {{has been used as a}} generator of spatial data for further analysis. These uses have made it extremely important that geocoding results be as accurate as possible. Existing global-weighting approaches <b>to</b> <b>geocoding</b> assume spatial stationarity of addressing systems and address data characteristic distributions across space, resulting in heuristics and approaches that apply global parameters <b>to</b> produce <b>geocodes</b> for addresses in all regions. However, different regions in the United States (US) have different values and densities of address attributes, which increases the error of standard algorithms that assume global parameters and calculation weights. Region-based dynamic weighting can be used in probabilistic <b>geocoding</b> approaches <b>to</b> stabilize and reduce incorrect match probability assignments that are due to place-specific naming conventions which vary region-to-region across the US. This study tested the spatial accuracy and time efficiency of a region-based dynamic weighting probabilistic geocoding system, as compared to a set of manually corrected geocoding results within Los Angeles City. The results of this study show that the region-based dynamic weighting probabilistic method improves the spatial accuracy of geocoding results and has a moderate influence on the time efficiency of the geocoding system...|$|R

40|$|Purpose– Improvements and {{portability}} {{of technologies}} and smart devices have enabled a {{rapid growth in}} the amount of user-generated media such as photographs and videos. Whilst various media generation and management systems exist, it still remains a challenge to discover the right information, for the right purpose. This paper aims to propose an approach <b>to</b> reverse <b>geocoding</b> by cross-referencing multiple geospatial data sources to enable the enrichment of media and therefore enable better organisation and searching of the media to create an overall picture about places. Design/methodology/approach– The paper presents a system architecture that incorporates the proposed approach to aggregate several geospatial databases to enrich geo-tagged media with human readable information, which will further enable the goal of creating an overall picture about places. The approach enables the semantic information relating to point of interest. Findings– Implementation of the proposed approach shows that a single geospatial data source does not contain enough information to accurately describe the high-level geospatial information for geocoded multimedia. However, fusing several geospatial data sources together enables richer, more accurate high-level geospatial information to be tagged <b>to</b> the <b>geocoded</b> multimedia. Originality/value– The contribution in this paper shows that high-level geospatial information can be retrieved from many data sources and fused together <b>to</b> enrich <b>geocoded</b> multimedia which can facilitate better searching and retrieval of the multimedia...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} into the difficulties facing researchers attempting <b>to</b> <b>geocode</b> data derived from social networking sites for analysis is presented. A number of issues are identified that arise from the differing levels of detail with which people describe their location, and from the reliance on place-names, which do not necessarily constitute unique identifiers for a given location.

This approach <b>to</b> reverse <b>geocoding</b> does not return actual addresses, only estimates of what should be there based on the predetermined range.
