5|$|An {{approximately}} 1,000-person team developed Grand <b>Theft</b> Auto V, an action-adventure video game, {{over several}} years. Rockstar Games released Grand <b>Theft</b> Auto V on 17 September 2013 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, on 18 November 2014 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and on 14 April 2015 for Microsoft Windows, as the fifteenth {{entry in the}} Grand <b>Theft</b> Auto series. Development began soon after Grand <b>Theft</b> Auto IVs release and was led by Rockstar North's core 360-person team, who collaborated with several other international Rockstar Games studios. The team considered the game a spiritual successor to many of their previous projects like Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3. After its unexpected announcement in 2011, the game was fervently promoted with press showings, cinematic trailers, viral marketing strategies and special editions. Its release date, though subject to several delays, was widely anticipated.|$|E

5|$|By Justinian's time, {{the scheme}} was simpler: instead of {{complementing}} actions for manifest and non-manifest <b>theft,</b> handling stolen goods, or concealing them made one instead liable for non-manifest <b>theft,</b> whose two-times penalty was maintained. Searches {{were carried out}} by public authorities, and the wide definition of <b>theft</b> covered a bad faith receiver of goods.|$|E

Once the Denpasar District court reached guilty verdicts and issued sentences it was reported in the Australian media that members of the group had been convicted of offences in Australia before their arrests in Indonesia.

40|$|Abstract; During April 1995, a bicycle-mounted {{security}} patrol {{was introduced}} into a vehicle-theft "hot spot, " the largest park-and-ride commuter vehicle park in British Columbia. Vehicle <b>thefts</b> dropped substantially {{in the vehicle}} park during the bicycle patrol, and remained low {{for an extended period}} of time after the bike patrol was withdrawn. Vehicle <b>thefts</b> did not appear to displace to adjacent areas or to another nearby hot spot on the transit system. Some vehicle <b>thefts</b> may have been displaced to a more distant hot spot, but the overall result for the city as a whole was a small net reduction in vehicle <b>thefts...</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{the fourth}} quarter of 2008, world market prices for metals like copper, aluminium, and {{platinum}} dropped steeply. Although there is anecdotal evidence that this price decrease has led to fewer metal <b>thefts,</b> strong empirical research on the exact nature of the relationship between commodity prices and metal <b>thefts</b> is still lacking. Some have argued that the [...] "genie is out of the bottle" [...] now and drops in commodity prices will not result in corresponding drops in <b>thefts.</b> In fact, it is possible that <b>thefts</b> may actually increase to compensate for the loss in value.|$|R
50|$|The {{murder rate}} for Waterford is 5.1 per 100,000 with one murder {{occurring}} in 2012. 6 robberies occurred {{as well as}} 38 assaults. In 2012, 55 burglaries, 451 <b>thefts</b> and 9 auto <b>thefts</b> occurred.|$|R
5|$|Development began {{soon after}} the release of Grand <b>Theft</b> Auto: San Andreas and was shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. The game {{introduced}} a shift to a more realistic and detailed style and tone for the series. Unlike previous entries, Grand <b>Theft</b> Auto IV had no strong cinematic influence, as the team attempted an original approach to the story. As part of their research for the open world, the developers conducted field research around New York throughout development and captured footage for the design team.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{announcement}} in May 2006, Grand <b>Theft</b> Auto IV was widely anticipated. Upon release, the game received universal critical acclaim, with praise particularly {{directed at the}} game's narrative and open world design. However, the game also generated controversy, with criticism directed at the game's depiction of violence and players' ability to drive {{under the influence of}} alcohol. Grand <b>Theft</b> Auto IV broke industry sales records and became the fastest-selling entertainment product in history at the time, earning US $310 million in its first day and US $500 million in its first week. Considered {{one of the most significant}} titles of the seventh generation of video games, and by many critics as one of the greatest video games of all time, it won year-end accolades, including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. A sequel, Grand <b>Theft</b> Auto V, was released in September 2013.|$|E

5|$|Grand <b>Theft</b> Auto III {{took the}} {{gameplay}} {{foundation of the}} first two Grand <b>Theft</b> Auto games and expanded it into a 3D world, and offered an unprecedented variety of minigames and side-missions. The title was a much greater commercial success than its direct precursors, and its influence was profound. As such, Grand <b>Theft</b> Auto III is credited with popularizing this genre, let alone inventing it. Its release is sometimes treated as a revolutionary event in the history of video games, much like the release of Doom nearly a decade earlier. GamePro called it the most important game of all time, and claimed that every genre was influenced to rethink their conventional level design. IGN similarly praised it {{as one of the top}} ten most influential games of all time. Subsequent games that follow this formula of driving and shooting in a free-roaming level have been called Grand <b>Theft</b> Auto clones.|$|E
5|$|Grand <b>Theft</b> Auto III was {{released}} on 21 May 2002 for Microsoft Windows, supporting higher screen resolutions and draw distance, and featuring more detailed textures.

For its release on the Xbox in December 2003, Grand <b>Theft</b> Auto III was bundled with its sequel Vice City in a compilation titled Grand <b>Theft</b> Auto: Double Pack. The Xbox port features custom soundtrack support as well as improved audio, polygon models, and reflections over the previous ports. Double Pack was later bundled with San Andreas in a compilation titled , released in October 2005. The Trilogy was also released for OS X on 12 November 2010. For the game's tenth anniversary in December 2011, War Drum Studios ported Grand <b>Theft</b> Auto III to several iOS and Android devices. The port is almost identical to the Windows version of the game, in addition to enhanced textures and models and touchscreen controls. A PlayStation 3 version of Grand <b>Theft</b> Auto III {{was released}} on 25 September 2012 via the PlayStation Network. The original PlayStation 2 version of the game was released for the PlayStation 4 on 5 December 2015.|$|E
5|$|Grand <b>Theft</b> Auto Online {{launched}} on 1 October 2013, {{two weeks after}} Grand <b>Theft</b> Auto Vs release. Many players reported connection difficulties and game freezes during load screens. Rockstar released a technical patch on 5 October {{in an effort to}} resolve the issues, but problems persisted the second week following launch as some players reported their character progress as having disappeared. Another technical patch was released on 10 October combating the issues and Rockstar offered a GTA$500,000 (in-game currency) stimulus to the accounts of all players connected to Online since launch as recompense. Because of the widespread technical issues present at launch, many reviewers bemoaned their Grand <b>Theft</b> Auto Online experience, but generally recognised its open-ended exploration and dynamic content as strengths.|$|E

40|$|My diploma thesis {{deals with}} {{distribution}} analysis of car <b>thefts</b> {{in the town}} of Liberec and will look at the options of situational crime prevention techniques. In my diploma thesis I have used the concept of hot spots which is able to show higher than average concentrations of car <b>thefts</b> in the study area. The database is relatively unique, provided by the regional police department in Liberec and contains the records of more than a thousand reported car <b>thefts</b> in Liberec between the years 2011 - 2014. The provided data contains GPS coordinates and thanks to them, it was possible, with relatively high accuracy, to identify hot spots of car <b>thefts</b> in Liberec. The identification of hot spots was possible as spatial statistics were used that enabled concrete calculations of kernel density, which made it possible to identify problem locations. In our chosen hot spots we then undertook our fieldwork, whose main goal was to evaluate the options of utilization strategy CPTED, so as to obtain preventive measures in problem locations. The output of this thesis include hot spot maps of car <b>thefts</b> 2011 - 2014 and also recommendations for preventive measures, which would be advisable to implement in chosen hot spots.
