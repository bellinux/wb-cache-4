5|$|Dalton {{applied the}} logic of abolitionism {{to the cause of}} women's freedom. She said that just as no one should be made a slave because of their race, women should not have to be subservient because of their gender. She saw the Victorian ideals for women in {{marriage}} as part of that slavish subservience. She argued that since a woman loses all her property when she marries, that it would be more advantageous for her to not officially marry so she could still buy and sell land and have legal claim over her own children and her own body. Dalton also argued that new brides should be allowed <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>when</b> they have their first child. Some of her ideas were surprisingly radical for a Mormon woman at the time, and she and Elizabeth Cady Stanton agreed that women needed to protect themselves from unjust laws.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest {{games have}} an overall upbeat feeling. The typical Dragon Quest plot {{involves}} the player controlling {{a party of}} heroes to defeat an ultimate evil villain, who usually threatens the world in some way. The plot-line often consists of smaller stories that involve encounters with other characters. This linear plot-line is intentional, to help ease the generally high learning curve RPGs have for those unaccustomed to them. The gameplay is designed to allow players <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>when,</b> and whether, to pursue certain storyline paths. To ensure players continue to enjoy playing the game, no storyline path is made without some kind of reward and, to help ease players who may be apprehensive about whether {{they are on the}} right path, the distance the character has to travel to get rewarded is reduced {{at the beginning of the}} game. While the player never starts the game in a wholly non-linear way, they usually allow players to explore an open world in a non-linear manner following an early linear section of the game. Early character levels start players off with more hit points and a substantially increasing growth at later levels, although the effective bonuses of every additional level decreases.|$|E

5|$|When {{the parents}} of Rufus Wooding, a young patient of Meyer's, {{suddenly}} withdraw their consent for a complicated operation, total cavo-pulmonary connection (TCPC), Meyer discovers that his SHO, Sam Kennedy (Collette Brown), has intervened and persuaded the parents not {{to go ahead with}} surgery. Believing that his authority has been undermined, Meyer promptly fires her. Kennedy threatens to go to the press if Meyer is not investigated, so the hospital Board begin an enquiry, during which Meyer is suspended. The investigation is headed by Meyer's old friend and rival, Tom Campbell-Gore (Denis Lawson). It concluded that Meyer's clinical skills were exemplary and unquestionable, although the Board, aware that Meyer's penchant for taking extremely difficult cases has made hospital death rates appear bad, remove Meyer's discretion <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>when</b> to operate in such cases. This decision angers Meyer, who argues that he performs operations that are {{in the interests of the}} patients not league tables. The Board also relieve Meyer of his registrar Alex Adams (Jeremy Sheffield). Meyer resigns to work in Michigan to develop an artificial heart, while Campbell-Gore takes his post at Holby.|$|E

25|$|Much {{strategy}} in cribbage {{derives from the}} fact that the first hand counted is the non-dealer's. The dealer may be only two holes from winning and the opponent twenty, but if the pone holds a 3-3-4-5 hand and has cut a 5, the dealer who pegs only a Go will lose. Players use this knowledge <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>when</b> to throw their hands (or play their cards) aggressively or defensively.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to direct methods, iterative methods {{are not expected}} to terminate in a finite number of steps. Starting from an initial guess, iterative methods form successive approximations that converge to the exact solution only in the limit. A convergence test, often involving the residual, is specified in order <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>when</b> a sufficiently accurate solution has (hopefully) been found. Even using infinite precision arithmetic these methods would not reach the solution within a finite number of steps (in general). Examples include Newton's method, the bisection method, and Jacobi iteration. In computational matrix algebra, iterative methods are generally needed for large problems.|$|E
25|$|Taíno {{society was}} based on a matrilineal system, meaning that descent was traced through the mother and that women lived {{together}} with other women and their children apart from the men. Because of this Taíno women seem to {{have had a lot of}} control over their lives, their co-villagers and their bodies. Since they lived separately from men, they were able <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>when</b> they wanted to involve in sexual contact. This is in part what shaped the views of conquistadors who came in contact with Taíno culture. They reportedly perceived women as “macho women” who had strong control over the men.|$|E

30|$|Multicore {{platforms}} are {{now very}} common in the embedded systems domain as they provide more computing power for the execution of complex applications with stringent timing constraints.

While a uniprocessor scheduling problem reduces <b>to</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>when</b> <b>to</b> schedule each task, a new dimension adds to this one when shifting to multicores: it must also be <b>decided</b> where <b>to</b> execute each task. In order to solve this rather challenging issue, several scheduling algorithms have been proposed in the literature (see [1] for a comprehensive and up-to-date survey).|$|R

Moreover, each game is likely to take a different course, as most events in the game are random, including the economic and political systems, and early in the game, these can greatly affect future strategic options. In the course of the game a player may try to tack in a frigate in order to run down a smaller and faster pinnace, but must be fortunate enough to have the weather gage.|$|R

25|$|In other cases, {{opinions}} differ, {{no consensus}} is forthcoming, {{and all are}} free to choose. With agreement among the Fathers, though, the authority of interpretation grows, and full patristic consensus is very strong. With canon law (which tends to be highly rigorous and very strict, especially with clergy) an unalterable validity also does not apply, since canons deal with living on earth, where conditions are always changing and each case is subject to almost infinite variation from the next. Even when and where they were once used with full strictness, their application was not absolute, and was carried out for individuals under the pastoral care of their bishop, who had the authority <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>when</b> individual discipline had been satisfied.

25|$|Article 49(1) of the Constitution, {{which is}} the {{provision}} governing by-elections in Singapore today, does not stipulate a time limit within which a vacant parliamentary seat must be filled.

He described the legal framework as his Government understood it as facilitating the efficient execution of the Government's policies, because political parties rather than individual candidates exist as the fundamental elements of the government.

In 2013, the Court of Appeal held in Vellama d/o Marie Muthu v. Attorney-General (2013) that this was an incorrect interpretation of Article 49(1).|$|E
40|$|Information hiding {{modularity}} (IHM) creates valuable {{options to}} switch one hidden module to another. The binding time for such switching is generally design time: as conditions change, new modules are created and switched in {{to keep a}} system current. Run-time switching is a clear analog and is sometimes beneficial. However, in face of switching costs and uncertainty about future conditions, when to switch is not clear. In recent work, we showed {{that it might be}} possible to estimate the economic value of design-time switching options created by IHM using real options theory. In this paper, we explore the flexibility to switch dynamically with a focus on optimal timing of decisions to switch. Our contribution is the idea that options theory holds an answer: <b>Deciding</b> <b>when</b> <b>to</b> switch under uncertainty is tantamount <b>to</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>when</b> <b>to</b> exercise a real option, which, in turn, is...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{application}} of contingent claims analysis (CCA) to two "hot" issues in life-cycle finance: (1) investing for retirement and (2) <b>deciding</b> <b>when,</b> if ever, <b>to</b> switch careers.

Today they are defaulted into life-cycle mutual funds that pass all risk directly through to the participant. We use CCA to demonstrate how financial firms can design and produce guaranteed contingent benefit contracts that improve participant welfare at no additional cost to the system. In exploring the career-choice issue {{in the second part of}} the paper, we use CCA in a somewhat different way. The decision to switch careers is analogous <b>to</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>when</b> <b>to</b> exercise an American-style option to swap one asset for another.

500|$|Many {{guidelines}} and testing procedures have strict procedures for disclosure and confidentiality to allow individuals <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>when</b> {{and how to}} receive their results and also to whom the results are made available. Financial institutions and businesses {{are faced with the}} question of whether to use genetic test results when assessing an individual, such as for life insurance or employment. The United Kingdom's insurance companies have agreed that until 2017 they will not use genetic information when writing insurance policies under , but Huntington's is explicitly excluded from this agreement. [...] As with other untreatable genetic conditions with a later onset, it is ethically questionable to perform pre-symptomatic testing on a child or adolescent, as there would be no medical benefit for that individual. There is consensus for testing only individuals who are considered cognitively mature, although there is a counter-argument that parents have a right to make the decision on their child's behalf. With the lack of an effective treatment, testing a person under legal age who is not judged to be competent is considered unethical in most cases.|$|E
