5|$|The artist {{emerged in}} 1489 {{as part of}} the {{cultural}} world of Milan, beginning a successful career that turned him into a leading exponent of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia, distinguishing himself with works of cultural import such as his cycle of the Caesars for the Loggia palace in Brescia, as well as the Martinengo mausoleum. He introduced a powerful and highly expressive classical <b>taste,</b> <b>as</b> opposed to the hitherto existing refined decorativeness. During {{the first decade of the}} sixteenth century, Gasparo was able to win over public and private clients who sought to translate into stone their pride in their supposed historical descent from ancient Rome.|$|E

25|$|Monovalent cation channel TRPM5 {{has been}} implicated in fattiness <b>taste</b> <b>as</b> well, but it {{is thought to be}} {{involved}} primarily in downstream processing of the taste rather than primary reception, as it is with other tastes such as bitter, sweet, and savory.|$|E
25|$|Antifreeze {{products}} for automotive use containing propylene glycol {{in place of}} ethylene glycol are available. They are generally considered safer to use, as propylene glycol does not <b>taste</b> <b>as</b> good and is converted in the body to lactic acid, a normal product of metabolism and exercise.|$|E
25|$|Great {{games and}} {{celebrations}} were held on 21 April to honour Caesar’s victory at Munda. Plutarch writes that many Romans found the triumph held following Caesar's victory {{to be in}} poor <b>taste,</b> <b>as</b> those defeated {{in the civil war}} had not been foreigners, but instead fellow Romans.|$|E

25|$|Exteroceptive senses are {{senses that}} {{perceive}} the body's own position, motion, and state, known as proprioceptive senses. External senses include the traditional five: sight, hearing, touch, smell and <b>taste,</b> <b>as</b> well as thermoception (temperature differences) and possibly an additional weak magnetoception (direction). Proprioceptive senses include nociception (pain); equilibrioception (balance); proprioception (a {{sense of the}} position and movement of the parts of one's own body).|$|E

25|$|Millet {{was also}} used for {{couscous}} by the Kel Ahaggar, a nomadic people of the desert of southern Algeria, who probably learned {{about it in the}} West African Sudan, where it has been known for centuries. Ibn Baṭṭūṭa in the above quote may have had a millet couscous. Ibn Baṭṭūṭa also mentions rice couscous in the area of Mali in 1350. Millet couscous was never as popular as hard wheat couscous because it took longer to cook and didn’t <b>taste</b> <b>as</b> good.|$|E
25|$|The {{taste of}} jianbing is also {{major reason for}} its popularity. Alisa Grandy, a western food vendor who serves jianbing in Portland, {{describes}} Jianbing’s <b>taste</b> <b>as</b> fantastic and special because the combination of different ordinary ingredients makes the taste {{greater than the sum}} of them. In the book Food and Chinese Culture: Essays on Popular Cuisine, it is described that the look and smell of Jianbing Guozi are as good as its taste, and it tastes better when serving with green garlic and fermented flour sauce with the sweetness of its crispy layer.|$|E

25|$|One {{effect of}} {{weightlessness}} on humans {{is that some}} astronauts report a change in their sense of taste when in space. Some astronauts find that their food is bland, others find that their favorite foods no longer <b>taste</b> <b>as</b> good (one who enjoyed coffee disliked the taste so much on a mission that he stopped drinking it after returning to Earth); some astronauts enjoy eating certain foods {{that they would not}} normally eat, and some experience no change whatsoever. Multiple tests have not identified the cause, and several theories have been suggested, including food degradation, and psychological changes such as boredom. Astronauts often choose strong-tasting food to combat the loss of taste.|$|E
25|$|The {{bitter taste}} is almost universally {{unpleasant}} to humans. This is because many nitrogenous organic molecules {{which have a}} pharmacological effect on humans taste bitter. These include caffeine, nicotine, and strychnine, which respectively compose the stimulant in coffee, addictive agent in cigarettes, and active compound in many pesticides. It appears that some psychological process allows humans to overcome their innate aversion to bitter <b>taste,</b> <b>as</b> caffeinated drinks are widely consumed and enjoyed around the world. It is also {{interesting to note that}} many common medicines have a bitter taste if chewed; the gustatory system apparently interprets these compounds as poisons. In this manner, the unpleasant reaction to the bitter taste is a last-line warning system before the compound is ingested and can do damage.|$|E
25|$|Naming {{laws in the}} People's Republic of China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau, {{as well as the}} Republic of China {{situated}} on the islands of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu) are based on technical capability rather than the appropriateness of words (as opposed to naming laws in Japan, which restrict the Kanji which can be used based on appropriate <b>taste,</b> <b>as</b> well as readability by all people). Although it is advised for parents to name their children so that others are able to easily read their names, there are no restrictions on the complexity of Chinese characters used, provided that there are no technical issues in doing so (see below). The use of Simplified characters is advised over Traditional Chinese characters; however, this is not strictly enforced.|$|E

25|$|It is {{in light}} of this socio-historical context that one realises why it was a source of pride for a Tang dynasty tomb to be filled with horses, camels, female attendants, robust manservants and exotic dancers from Central Asia. During the Tang period, the ability to own {{powerful}} horses and servants from Central Asia would have been a testimony of a person’s wealth, power and social standing. This is especially since Central Asia was renowned for its military power, strong warriors and formidable horses. It would also have been reflective of a person’s stylish, cosmopolitan <b>taste,</b> <b>as</b> it shows that this person is globalised and familiar with cultures outside of China. Many of Tang dynasty's tomb artefacts, such as Standing Horse, were meant to assert Tang China’s power over Central Asia.|$|E
25|$|While he {{was still}} campaigning in Spain, the Senate began bestowing honours on Caesar. Caesar had not proscribed his enemies, instead pardoning almost all, {{and there was no}} serious public {{opposition}} to him. Great games and celebrations were held in April to honour Caesar’s victory at Munda. Plutarch writes that many Romans found the triumph held following Caesar's victory to be in poor <b>taste,</b> <b>as</b> those defeated in the civil war had not been foreigners, but instead fellow Romans. On Caesar's return to Italy in September 45 BC, he filed his will, naming his grandnephew Gaius Octavius (Octavian, later known as Augustus Caesar) as his principal heir, leaving his vast estate and property including his name. Caesar also wrote that if Octavian died before Caesar did, Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus would be the next heir in succession. In his will, he also left a substantial gift to the citizens of Rome.|$|E
25|$|The {{galleries}} also link {{design to}} wider trends in British culture. For instance, {{design in the}} Tudor period {{was influenced by the}} spread of printed books and the work of European artists and craftsmen employed in Britain. In the Stuart period, increasing trade, especially with Asia, enabled wider access to luxuries like carpets, lacquered furniture, silks and porcelain. In the Georgian age there was increasing emphasis on entertainment and leisure. For example, the increase in tea drinking led to the production of tea paraphernalia such as china and caddies. European styles seen on the Grand Tour also influenced <b>taste.</b> <b>As</b> the Industrial Revolution took hold, the growth of mass production produced entrepreneurs such as Josiah Wedgwood, Matthew Boulton and Eleanor Coade. In the Victorian era new technology and machinery had a significant effect on manufacturing, {{and for the first time}} since the reformation, the Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches had a major effect on art and design such as the Gothic Revival. There is a large display on the Great Exhibition which, among other things, led to the founding of the V In the later 19th century, the increasing backlash against industrialisation, led by John Ruskin, contributed to the Arts and Crafts movement.|$|E
