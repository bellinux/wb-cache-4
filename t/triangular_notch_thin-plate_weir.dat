40|$|Abstract — Extended surfaces, {{commonly}} known as fins, often offer an economical and trouble free solution in many situations demanding natural convection heat transfer. Heat sinks {{in the form of}} fin arrays on horizontal and vertical surfaces used in variety of engineering applications, studies of heat transfer and fluid flow associated with such arrays are of considerable engineering significance. The main controlling variable generally available to designer is geometry of fin arrays. Considering the above fact, natural convection heat transfer from vertical rectangular fin arrays with <b>triangular</b> <b>notch</b> at the center have been investigated experimentally and theoretically. Moreover notches of different aspect ratio have also been analyzed for the purpose of comparison and optimization. In a lengthwise short array where the single chimney flow pattern is present, the central portion of fin flat becomes ineffective due to the fact that, already heated air comes in its contact. In the present study, the fin flats are modified by removing the central fin portion by cutting a <b>triangular</b> <b>notch.</b> This dissertation report presents an experimental analysis of the results obtained over a range of fin heights and heat dissipation rate.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the {{domain wall pinning}} behavior in Permalloynanowires using experimental measurements and micromagnetic simulations. Planar nanowirestructures were fabricated by electron beam lithography followed by thin-filmdeposition via thermal evaporation. The magnetization switching behavior of individual nanowires was measured using the magneto-optical Kerr effect. For symmetrical pinning structures such as the junction between a wider domain wall injection pad and a narrower nanowire, the domain wall depinning field increases as the wire width decreases, with the depinning field increasing rapidly for wires widths below 400 nm. For domain wall pinning at asymmetrical structures such as a notch, {{the magnitude of the}} depinning field appears relatively insensitive to <b>notch</b> geometry for <b>triangular</b> and rectangular <b>notch</b> structures, compared to the influence of the wire width.

40|$|<b>Thin-plate</b> <b>weirs</b> are {{commonly}} used as measuring devices in flumes and channels, enabling an accurate discharge measurement with simple instruments. The calibration formulae of such devices rely upon some empirical coefficients {{and there is a}} need to obtain new accurate physical data to complement the existing evidence. In the present study, the discharge calibration of a large 90 degrees V-notch thin plate weir was performed using an unsteady volume per time technique. The V-notch weir was initially closed by a fast-opening gate. The sudden opening induced an initial phase of the water motion dominated by the free-falling motion of a volume of fluid in the vicinity of the weir, followed by a gradually-varied phase, during which some seiche was observed in the tank. The relationship between water discharge and upstream water elevation was derived from the integral form of the continuity equation. The results yielded a dimensionless discharge coefficient C-d = 0. 58 close to previous experiments for 90 degrees V-notch weirs. The findings showed that the unsteady discharge calibration of the V-notch weir yielded similar results to a more traditional calibration approach based upon steady flow experiments, allowing a rapid testing over a broad range of flow rates.

Simulations were performed with a rectangular notch shape (the shape used for all the numerical simulation presented in this work), a slightly rounded notch (consistent with the real {{shape of the}} notch, where the angles are not exactly 90 ^∘ because of the saw profile) and a <b>triangular</b> <b>notch</b> (Fig.  15), which is intentionally chosen to be far from the real one.

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{dissolved}} oxygen (DO) {{in the waters}} of rivers and streams is very important to the quality and existence of aquatic life. Hydraulic structures {{have an impact on the}} amount of dissolved oxygen in a river system, even though the water is in contact with the structure for only a short time. The same quantity of oxygen transfer that normally would occur over several kilometers in a river can occur at a single hydraulic structure.

These air bubbles greatly increase the surface area available for mass transfer.

Corrosion pit results in a stress concentration and fatigue cracks usually initiate and propagate from these corrosion pits.

Four artificial notch shapes are considered: radial ellipse, axial ellipse, triangle and length-variable triangle.

The antenna is designed using the quasi self-complementary technique for attaining electrical {{as well as}} physical size reduction. A <b>triangular</b> <b>notch</b> is included in the ground plane for impedance matching between the antenna and the RF front end. The adoption of this miniaturization technique has narrowed the impedance bandwidth of the antenna in the UWB range but lead to an additional operating bandwidth in Ku band thereby exhibiting dual band behavior. This reduction in the bandwidth in the UWB range was overcome by using the tapered microstrip feed line configuration. The antenna exhibited a wide impedance bandwidth extending beyond the UWB range and hence could be used for both UWB as well as Ku band applications. The antenna has a physical dimension of 16 mm X 25 mm corresponding to an electrical size of 0. 24 λ and was designed on an FR 4 substrate with εr of 4. 7.
