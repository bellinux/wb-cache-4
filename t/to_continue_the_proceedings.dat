50|$|The lead {{judgment}} {{was given by}} Lord Denning MR. He held that the writ had been properly served on the defendant in England, and if a defendant is properly served with a writ while he is in this country, albeit on a short visit, the plaintiff was entitled <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> to the end. The plaintiff had validly invoked {{the jurisdiction of the}} Queen’s courts; and was entitled to require those courts to proceed to adjudicate upon the claim. The courts should not strike the claim out unless it was vexatious or oppressive, or otherwise an abuse of the process of the court. If the statement of claim discloses a reasonable cause of action, the plaintiff is entitled to pursue it in the English courts, even though the cause of action did arise in a foreign country. It should not be stayed unless it would plainly be unjust to the defendant to require him to defend it in England, and that injustice must be so great as to outweigh the right of the plaintiff to continue the claim here. He held that the burden of proof was on Mr Wildenstein to show that it would be an injustice to him to have the case tried in England, and that he had not discharged that burden.|$|E
40|$|Ace v. Moose Ace Insurance Ltd v. Moose Enterprise Pty Ltd is an unexceptional {{case of the}} New South Wales Supreme Court {{that deserves}} closer {{attention}} because it is probably the first common law decision on whether proceedings in a foreign court could constitute breach of a choice of law agreement, thus treading on “territory into which the English courts have not [yet] been invited to go”. The defendant, an Australian company, faced class action litigation in California arising out of allegations that toys it had been distributing—but subsequently recalled—in the United States contained toxic substances. The claimant, an Australian company which had insured the defendant against personal injury claims, initially defended the actions {{on behalf of the}} defendant. The claimant afterwards informed the defendant that it would stop doing so on the ground that the claims pursued in the class actions did not fall within the cover of the policy. The defendant then started proceedings in California seeking a declaration that the claimant was obliged under the law of California to defend the actions. The claimant responded by taking out proceedings in New South Wales for an anti-suit injunction to prevent the defendant from continuing the Californian proceedings. The insurance contract was made in Australia, and the critical clause was: “Should any dispute arise concerning this policy, the dispute will be determined in accordance with the law of Australia and the States and Territories thereof. In relation to any such dispute the parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of any competent court in a State or Territory of Australia”. Brereton J granted the anti-suit injunction on the familiar ground that the Californian action was in breach of the jurisdiction agreement in the parties’ contract, and that in any event the foreign conduct was vexatious and oppressive. 4 He found that, although the parties had not expressly used the word “exclusive” in the jurisdiction clause, as a matter of construction the parties had intended the Australian court to have exclusive jurisdiction, and the defendant was therefore under a contractual obligation not <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> in California. The more interesting aspect of the judgment lies in the treatment of the contention of counsel for the claimant, based primarily on the suggestions of Professor Adrian Briggs...|$|E
40|$|Tomasz Kałużny - Sędzia Sądu Rejonowego w Białymstoku. The paper {{includes}} the presentation and {{discussion on the}} proceeding rules regarding {{the approval of the}} remuneration tables for the use of objects of copyright and related rights within proceedings conducted by adjudicating panels of the Copyright Commission in accordance with the provisions of the Act on Copyright and Related Rights of 4 February 1994. The Copyright Commission conducts the proceedings essentially based on the provisions amended by the Constitutional Tribunal in its judgment of 24 January 2006 case file SK 40 / 04, in which it ruled on the unconstitutionality of Article 108 (3) of the aforementioned Act on Copyright regarding proceedings before the Commission on the approval of the remuneration tables for the use of objects of copyright or performances submitted by collective management organizations. As a result of the amendment, the binding regulations provide for defining the scope of proceeding before the Commission on the approval of rates submitted by collective management organizations with ensuring, in case of contesting a Commission’s decision, the possibility <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> before a general court. In the legislation the participation of parties in determining the composition of the adjudicating panel of the Commission, the introduction of restrictions on the length of proceedings and the opportunity to challenge a decision of the adjudicating panel of the Commission by filing a relevant application to the participant and to submit the case to court were exposed. In the assessment of the proceeding concerning the approval of remuneration tables for objects of copyright or related rights, its consistency and compatibility with the concepts of the modern settlement of disputes were indicated. Additionally, the compliance of the provisions with the EU law standards laid down in the latest EU legislation was underlined, including regulations aimed at ensuring the coordination of national provisions concerning the conditions for copyright and related rights management by collective management organizations to ensure a high level of management, transparency and reporting according to the objectives of Directive 2014 / 26 /EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on collective management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online use in the internal market. It can be concluded that it is possible and desirable to use the modern alternative methods of dispute resolution in the area of proceeding on the approval of remuneration tables, particularly in disputes concerning the application of the approved remuneration tables.
