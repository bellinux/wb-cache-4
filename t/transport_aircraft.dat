5|$|One {{specific}} {{failure in}} the massive operation was the critical lack of <b>transport</b> <b>aircraft</b> for the operation, an unsolved flaw that had dogged every large-scale airborne operation the Allies had conducted. In the original planning for Varsity, an extra airborne division, the 13th, had been included; however, a lack of <b>transport</b> <b>aircraft</b> to drop this division led to it being excluded from the final plan. Thus, the unsolved problem of a shortage of <b>transport</b> <b>aircraft</b> meant {{that a third of}} the planned troops to be used were discarded, weakening the fighting power of the airborne formation. In the event, the airborne troops actually employed were sufficient to overwhelm the defenders.|$|E

5|$|The Antonov An-70 (-70) is a four-engine medium-range <b>transport</b> <b>{{aircraft}},</b> and {{the first}} aircraft to take flight powered only by propfan engines. It {{was developed in the}} late 1980s by the Antonov Design Bureau to replace the obsolete An-12 military <b>transport</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The maiden flight of the first prototype took place in December 1994 in Kiev, now-independent Ukraine. Within months the prototype had suffered a mid-air collision. A second airframe was produced to allow the flight-test programme to proceed. Both prototypes were produced by the Kiev Aircraft Production Plant.|$|E

5|$|After its {{defeat in}} World War I, Germany was banned from {{operating}} {{an air force}} by the Treaty of Versailles. German re-armament began earnestly in the 1930s and was initially kept secret because it violated the treaty. The early development of military bombers was disguised as a development program for civilian <b>transport</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E

5|$|Detailed {{planning}} for the Tonga began in February, starting {{with the number of}} <b>transport</b> <b>aircraft</b> assigned to the operation being expanded rapidly to accommodate the entire division. Two Royal Air Force (RAF) air groups were provided for the operation to ensure that the division could be deployed in just two airlifts. The pilots and crew of these <b>transport</b> <b>aircraft</b> then began formation flying training and specialised aircrew training to ensure that they were as familiar with what the operation required of them. The 6th Airborne Division carried out several large-scale airborne exercises, using them to find {{the most efficient way to}} deploy a brigade group on one or multiple landing-zones. On 6 February, the 3rd Parachute Brigade undertook an exercise in which the entire brigade was dropped by 98 <b>transport</b> <b>aircraft.</b> At the end of March, 284 aircraft were used in Exercise 'Bizz II' in which the entire division was deployed by parachute or glider. Finally, between 21 April and 26 April, Exercise 'Mush' utilised approximately 700 aircraft to deploy the British 1st Airborne Division and the Polish 1st Parachute Brigade against the 6th Airborne Division, who moved by road, in a simulation of a full-scale airborne operation.|$|E
5|$|The Heinkel He 111 {{served on}} all the German {{military}} fronts in the European Theatre of World War II. Beginning the war as a medium bomber it supported the German campaigns in the field until 1943 when, owing to Western Allied and Soviet air superiority, it reverted to a <b>transport</b> <b>aircraft</b> role.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, new {{versions}} of the Merlin (the 600- and 700-series) were designed and produced for use in commercial airliners such as the Avro Tudor, military <b>transport</b> <b>aircraft</b> such as the Avro York, and the Canadair North Star which performed in both roles. These engines were basically military specification with some minor changes to suit the different operating environment.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} years of the 1960s the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{considered}} new types of tactical <b>transport</b> <b>aircraft</b> to replace the RAAF's obsolete Douglas Dakotas. The Army wanted a simple and rugged aircraft that could be purchased immediately, and pressed for the acquisition of de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribous, but the RAAF regarded the Caribou as inadequate for the role and preferred a more sophisticated aircraft, leading to delays in the selection process.|$|E
5|$|Early in the afternoon, the North Korean {{aircraft}} {{returned in}} larger numbers {{to attack the}} air transports. A flight of eight Ilyushin Il-10s appeared in the airspace between Seoul and Inchon, attempting to ambush <b>transport</b> <b>aircraft</b> while still {{on the ground at}} the airfields. The F-80s spotted the North Korean planes and engaged them. The North Korean aircraft split into two groups of four and quickly destroyed a Republic of Korea Air Force T-6 Texan parked on the tarmac at Kimpo.|$|E

The Malawi Air Force was established with German help in 1976, and operates {{a small number of}} <b>transport</b> <b>aircraft</b> and multi-purpose helicopters.
