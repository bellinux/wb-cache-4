5|$|In 2010, {{researchers}} at the University of Michigan studied the effect of combining video clips of Sesame Street and related print materials, online activities, and teacher training and mentoring on learning. They demonstrated that all the subjects they tested at Head Start programs in Detroit scored <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> middle-class control group in tests later given to both groups.|$|E
5|$|Vanadinite is very brittle, {{producing}} small, conchoidal fragments when fractured. Its hardness is 3–4 on the Mohs scale, about <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> copper coin. Vanadinite {{is particularly}} heavy for a translucent mineral. It has a molar mass of 1416.27g/mole and its specific gravity can range between 6.6 and 7.2 because of impurities.|$|E

5|$|A {{downline}} {{used for}} open ocean diving is much <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> shotline, {{but does not}} reach {{all the way to}} the bottom. An open-ocean downline is weighted at the bottom, and attached to a substantial float at the surface, which may be tethered to the boat. It may be marked at intervals by knots or loops, and may be attached to decompression trapeze system. In some cases a sea anchor may be used to limit wind drift, particularly if attached to a boat with significant windage.|$|E
5|$|During their 15-day {{rest periods}} the company's men congregated around the Belgian-owned Elizabeth Hotel, in {{the centre of}} the city at the corner of Causeway and Manica Road. Many of them became seriously disaffected when they first {{received}} their salary from the Rhodesian Army. Having apparently been misled about wages of up to R$1,000 per month (₣7,000) by the French recruiters, they were surprised to find that their basic monthly pay was actually R$245 (₣1,800), <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> regular Rhodesian soldier. Moreover, some were upset that they had been paid in Rhodesian dollars, which because of the country's international isolation could not easily be exchanged for foreign currencies. Although it was not as much as they had been expecting, one disenchanted veteran of the unit afterwards admitted that the tax-exempt R$245 wage, which came with a $10 special-unit supplement, was still more than enough money for them to live comfortably in Salisbury during their time off.|$|E
5|$|Every 3-colorable graph G that {{contains}} a triangle (that is, has the complete graph K3 as a subgraph) is homomorphically equivalent to K3. This is because, on one hand, a 3-coloring of G is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> homomorphism G → K3, as explained below. On the other hand, every subgraph of G trivially admits a homomorphism into G, implying K3 → G. This also means that K3 {{is the core of}} any such graph G. Similarly, every bipartite graph that has at least one edge is equivalent to K2.|$|E

5|$|The regular {{army was}} {{supported}} by the Territorial Force, and by reservists. In August 1914, there were three forms of reserves. The Army Reserve of retired soldiers was 145,350 strong. They were paid 3Shillings and 6pence a week (17.5pence) worth about £70 per week in 2013 terms, and had to attend 12 training days per year. The Special Reserve had another 64,000 men and was a form of part-time soldiering, similar to the Territorial Force. A Special Reservist had an initial six months full-time training and was paid <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> regular soldier during this period; they had three or four weeks training per year thereafter. The National Reserve had some 215,000 men, who were on a register that was maintained by Territorial Force County Associations; these men had military experience, but no other reserve obligation.|$|E
5|$|A {{short run}} of Gran Trak systems was {{produced}} in March 1974 and revealed other design problems, such as the steering controls; in their prototype system, Eigen used real a real car steering wheel and pedals, but the production run used different parts. Alcorn returned to Cyan that month and redesigned the game to fix the flaws and use more standard parts; the copying protection scheme was changed to use a custom-designed integrated circuit that was named <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> standard Texas Instruments integrated circuit. Alcorn later stated {{in an interview that}} neither Warman nor Emmons understood the challenges in converting a prototype design to a product that could be manufactured. The game entered production soon after, and Atari announced it was shipping a full production run in May 1974. Although the design flaws were fixed, the communication problems during development led to one final problem with the game: Atari was unclear on the actual cost of producing the game. As a result, a single Gran Trak game ended up costing US$1,095 to manufacture, while Atari was selling them to distributors for only $995, losing $100 per sale. Atari soon corrected the problem, but ended the fiscal year with a large loss {{due in part to the}} financial failure of the game.|$|E
