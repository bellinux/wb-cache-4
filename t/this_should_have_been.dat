25|$|Three months later, {{returning}} to Showtime after the hotly contested Jose Luis Castillo Vs Diego Corrales rubber match fell through, Vic's defense against then-undefeated Mexican contender Luis Maldonado {{was moved to}} the main event. He stopped the tough Mexican in the 8th round. In his fifth title defense, Vic faced Glenn Donaire. Glenn gave up during the fight, claiming Vic broke his jaw in the 6th round from an alleged elbow attack. Replays show no evidence of an elbow. Darchinyan's camp, though winners by technical decision, have always claimed <b>this</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a legitimate knockout.|$|E
25|$|At Rutherford's behest, Geiger and Marsden {{performed}} {{a series of}} experiments where they pointed a beam of alpha particles at a thin foil of metal and measured the scattering pattern by using a fluorescent screen. They spotted alpha particles bouncing off the metal foil in all directions, some right back at the source. <b>This</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> impossible according to Thomson's model; the alpha particles should have all gone straight through. Obviously, those particles had encountered an electrostatic force far greater than Thomson's model suggested they would, which in turn implied that the atom's positive charge was concentrated in a much tinier volume than Thomson imagined.|$|E

25|$|The {{design of}} the points on the {{approaches}} to Paddington did not provide 'flank protection' (where the points beyond a signal at red are set so that a train passing the signal at red is routed so as to minimise the possible consequences). This would have meant routing a train running past SN109 at red onto the Down Relief line. <b>This</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> considered {{at the design stage}} when {{it would have been easy}} to implement. The reasons for not doing so were not known but it was noted that the introduction of Automatic Train Protection (ATP) had been thought to be imminent. Flank protection would have increased the 'overlap' (the distance for which a train could run past the signal before fouling other lines) at SN109; the desirability of doing so should have been considered by the risk assessment which had not taken place.|$|E
500|$|Henrietta Elizabeth [...] "Harriet" [...] Leveson-Gower, Countess Granville (née Cavendish; 29 August 1785 – 25 November 1862) was a British peeress {{and society}} hostess. She {{was born in}} Devonshire House as the second {{daughter}} of William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire by his wife, the political hostess Lady Georgiana Spencer. Despite her parents' turbulent marriage, Harriet had a happy childhood. Her mother's death in 1806 led to an unpleasant situation in which her father's long-time mistress Lady Elizabeth Foster {{took control of the}} Devonshire household; as the unmarried eldest daughter, <b>this</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> Harriet's role.|$|E
500|$|Even {{before the}} ill-fated rescue attempt, IOC {{officials}} began conferring. Killanin {{and other officials}} were in Kiel for the yacht racing; they hurried back to Munich. Just before 4pm, Brundage called off {{the remainder of the}} day's events, and announced a memorial service honoring those who had already died for the following morning. Many Olympic leaders were critical of Brundage for his participation in the discussions with the government, feeling that <b>this</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> left for the authorities and the local organizing committee, but all supported the memorial service, which was held the following day in the Olympic Stadium. There, before the audience in the stadium and the millions watching on television, Brundage offered what Guttmann called [...] "the credo of his life": ...|$|E

2500|$|The report {{noted that}} the {{official}} capacity of the central pens was 2,200, that the Health and Safety Executive found <b>this</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> reduced to 1,693 due to crush barriers and perimeter gates, but actually an estimated 3,000 people were in the pens around 3:00pm. The report said [...] "When spectators first appeared on the track, the immediate assumption {{in the control room}} was that a pitch invasion was threatened. This was unlikely {{at the beginning of a}} match. It became still less likely when those on the track made no move towards the pitch. ... here was no effective leadership either from control or on the pitch to harness and organise rescue efforts. No orders were given for officers to enter the tunnel and relieve pressure". Further that: [...] "The anxiety to protect the sanctity of the pitch has caused insufficient attention to be paid to the risk of a crush due to overcrowding".|$|E
2500|$|Late that season, {{the screen}} figured in the National League pennant race. The Braves were playing the Dodgers in the Coliseum on September 15, 1959, and Joe Adcock hit a ball that cleared the screen but hit a steel girder {{behind it and}} got stuck in the mesh. According to the ground rules, <b>this</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a home run. However, the umpires ruled it a ground-rule double. Then the fans shook the screen, causing the ball {{to fall into the}} seats. The umpires changed the call to a homer, only to change their minds again and rule it a ground-rule double. [...] Adcock was left {{stranded}} on second. The game was tied at the end of nine innings and the Dodgers won it in the tenth inning. At the end of the regular season, the Dodgers and Braves finished in a tie. The Dodgers won the ensuing playoff and {{went on to win the}} World Series.|$|E
