25|$|The journey {{began at}} Folly Bridge in Oxford and ended 3 miles (5km) north-west {{in the village}} of Godstow. During the trip, Dodgson told the girls a story that {{featured}} a bored little girl named Alice who goes looking for an adventure. The girls loved it, and Alice Liddell asked Dodgson <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> for her. He began writing the manuscript of the story the next day, although that earliest version no longer exists. The girls and Dodgson took another boat trip a month later when he elaborated the plot to the story of Alice, and in November he began working on the manuscript in earnest.|$|E
25|$|On 4 July 1862, in a {{rowing boat}} {{travelling}} on the Isis from Folly Bridge, Oxford, to Godstow {{for a picnic}} outing, 10-year-old Alice asked Charles Dodgson (who wrote under the pen name Lewis Carroll) to entertain her and her sisters, Edith (aged 8) and Lorina (13), with a story. As the Reverend Robinson Duckworth rowed the boat, Dodgson regaled the girls with fantastic stories of a girl, named Alice, and her adventures after she fell into a rabbit-hole. The story was not unlike those Dodgson had spun for the sisters before, but this time Liddell asked Mr. Dodgson <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> for her. He promised to do so but did not get around to the task for some months. He eventually presented her with the manuscript of Alice's Adventures Under Ground in November 1864.|$|E

The solution is then naturally given in an operator form, known as the Kraus representation. Following a few simple examples, the general applicability of the method is clarified.

5000|$|Gilmore later {{acknowledged}} that the music was not original but was, {{as he put it}} in an 1883 article in the Musical Herald, [...] "a musical waif which I happened to hear somebody humming {{in the early days of}} the rebellion, and taking a fancy <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> <b>down,</b> dressed <b>it</b> up, gave it a name, and rhymed it into usefulness for a special purpose suited to the times." ...|$|R
500|$|From Mahler's later {{comments}} on the symphony's gestation, {{it is evident that}} the four-movement plan was relatively short-lived. He soon replaced the last three movements with a single section, essentially a dramatic cantata, based on the closing scenes of Goethe's Faust, the depiction of an ideal of redemption through eternal womanhood (das Ewige-Weibliche). Mahler had long nurtured an ambition to set the end of the Faust epic to music, [...] "and to set it quite differently from other composers who have made it saccharine and feeble." [...] In comments recorded by his biographer Richard Specht, Mahler makes no mention of the original four-movement plans. He told Specht that having chanced on the Veni creator hymn, he had a sudden vision of the complete work: [...] "I saw the whole piece immediately before my eyes, and only needed <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> as though it were being dictated to me." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Come Running" [...] was {{described}} by Morrison as [...] "a very light type of song. It's not too heavy; it's just a happy-go-lucky song." [...] By contrast, Hinton found the song's sentiments tender and lustful in the vein of the 1967 Bob Dylan song [...] "I'll Be Your Baby Tonight". He argued that [...] "Come Running" [...] juxtaposed images of unstoppable nature—wind and rain, a passing train—against [...] "which human life and death play out their little games", which the narrator and his lover dream will not end [...] "while knowing of course it will". According to the writer, [...] "These Dreams of You" [...] manages to be simultaneously accusatory and reassuring. The lyrics cover such dream sequences as Ray Charles being shot down, paying dues in Canada, and [...] "his angel from above" [...] cheating while playing cards in the dark, slapping him in the face, ignoring his cries, and walking out on him. Morrison said he was inspired to write [...] "Brand New Day" [...] after hearing The Band on the radio playing either [...] "The Weight" [...] or [...] "I Shall Be Released": [...] "I {{looked up at the}} sky and the sun started to shine and all of a sudden the song just came through my head. I started <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>it</b> <b>down,</b> right from 'When all the dark clouds roll away'." [...] Yorke quoted Morrison as saying in 1973 that [...] "Brand New Day" [...] was the song that worked best to his ear and the one with which he felt most in touch.|$|E

2500|$|The band did not tour {{in support}} of the album.

So, to play it live, to take a part that was done in spontaneity, <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> and then get someone to play it, would lose the whole point, lose the whole purity of what it was in the first place."

From the beginning, U.S. POWs endured miserable conditions, including poor food and unsanitary conditions. [...] The prison complex was sarcastically nicknamed the [...] "Hanoi Hilton" [...] by the American POWs, in reference to the well-known Hilton Hotel chain. There is some disagreement among the first group of POWs who coined the name but F8D pilot Bob Shumaker was the first <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>it</b> <b>down,</b> carving [...] "Welcome to the Hanoi Hilton" [...] on the handle of a pail to greet the arrival of Air Force Lieutenant Robert Peel.|$|E

6000|$|Ample {{compensation}} for this disappointment was found, however, {{when the ship}} reached Porta Praya in St. Jago, {{the largest of the}} Cape de Verde Islands. Here he spent three most delightful weeks, and really commenced his work as a geologist and naturalist. <b>Writing</b> <b>to</b> his father he says, [...] "Geologising in a volcanic country is most delightful; besides the interest attached to itself, it leads you into most beautiful and retired spots. Nobody but a person fond of Natural History can imagine the pleasure of strolling under cocoa-nuts in a thicket of bananas and coffee-plants, and an endless number of wild flowers. And this island, that has given me so much instruction and delight, is reckoned the most uninteresting place that we perhaps shall touch at during our voyage. It certainly is generally very barren, but the valleys are more exquisitely beautiful, from the very contrast. It is utterly useless to say anything about the scenery; it would be as profitable to explain to a blind man colours, as to a person who has not been out of Europe, the total dissimilarity of a tropical view. Whenever I enjoy anything, I always look forward <b>to</b> <b>writing</b> <b>it</b> <b>down,</b> either in my log-book (which increases in bulk), or in a letter; so you must excuse raptures, and those raptures badly expressed. I find my collections are increasing wonderfully, and from Rio I think I shall be obliged to send a cargo home." ...|$|R
2500|$|Paes {{says of the}} city: [...] " [...] This is {{the best}} {{provided}} city in the world." [...] Domingo Paes was overwhelmed by the city and stated:" [...] The {{people in the city}} are countless in number, so much so that I do not wish <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> for fear it should be thought fabulous. What I saw seemed as large as Rome and very beautiful to the sight; there are many groves of trees within it, many orchards and gardens of fruit trees and many conduits of water which flow in the midst of it, and in places there are lakes." [...] The Italian traveler Nicolo Conti who visited the city in 1420 CE, estimated the circumference of the city to be sixty miles and was impressed by the strength of its fortifications.|$|E
2500|$|The hrossa (singular hross) {{resemble}} bipedal otters or seals, and {{are somewhat}} taller and thinner than humans. Ransom finds them beautiful: [...] "covered, face and all, with thick black animal hair, and whiskered {{like a cat}} ... glossy coat, liquid eye, sweet breath and whitest teeth" [...] (p.59, Chap. 9). They live in the low river valleys (handramit in the speech of the eldila) and specialize in farming, fishing, and performing arts such as dancing and poetry. They are especially gifted in making poetry; yet they refuse <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> as they believe that books ruin words and poems. Their technical level is low, and they wear only pocketed loincloths. The boats that they build are similar to our canoes. They add an initial /h/ sound to their words. Their sense of humor is [...] "extravagant and fantastic" [...] (Chap. 18).|$|E
2500|$|Newton's single-minded {{attention}} to his work generally, and to his project during this time, is shown by later reminiscences from his secretary and copyist of the period, Humphrey Newton. His account tells of Isaac Newton's absorption in his studies, how he sometimes forgot his food, or his sleep, or the state of his clothes, and how {{when he took a}} walk in his garden he would sometimes rush back to his room with some new thought, not even waiting to sit before beginning <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>it</b> <b>down.</b> [...] Other evidence also shows Newton's absorption in the Principia: Newton for years kept up a regular programme of chemical or alchemical experiments, and he normally kept dated notes of them, but for a period from May 1684 to April 1686, Newton's chemical notebooks have no entries at all. [...] So it seems that Newton abandoned pursuits to which he was normally dedicated, and did very little else for well over a year and a half, but concentrated on developing and writing what became his great work.|$|E

2500|$|An {{indication}} of the rapidity of development of this field can be inferred {{from the history of}} the seminal 1947 article by Burks, Goldstine and von Neumann. By the time that anyone had time <b>to</b> <b>write</b> anything <b>down,</b> <b>it</b> was obsolete. After 1945, others read John von Neumann's [...] First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC, and immediately started implementing their own systems.

5000|$|Eusebius also {{recorded}} an important tradition from Clement of Alexandria (died c. 213): In the same volumes Clement has found {{room for a}} tradition of the primitive authorities of the Church regarding {{the order of the}} gospels. It is this. He used to say that the earliest gospels were those containing the genealogies Luke, while Mark's originated as follows: When, at Rome, Peter had openly preached the word and by the Spirit had proclaimed the gospel, the large audience urged Mark, who had followed {{him for a long time}} and remembered what had been said, <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>it</b> all <b>down.</b> This he did, making his gospel available to all who wanted it. When Peter heard about this, he made no objection and gave no special encouragement. Last of all, aware that the physical facts had been recorded in the gospels, encouraged by his pupils and irresistibly moved by the Spirit, John wrote a spiritual gospel.|$|R
