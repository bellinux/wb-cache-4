50|$|Firestone Tire and Rubber Company was {{a leading}} player in the <b>US</b> <b>tire</b> industry, but {{failed to meet the}} {{challenge}} of change because they did not act appropriately. Entering the 1970s, Firestone had enjoyed 7 decades of uninterrupted growth. Their main rival was Goodyear, also based in Akron, Ohio, and a few other leading <b>US</b> <b>tire</b> producers. Firestone saw their challenge as simply keeping up with the steadily increasing demand for tires.|$|R
2500|$|Of {{the five}} biggest <b>U.S.</b> <b>tire</b> firms in 1970, today only Goodyear remains independent, {{due to the}} {{challenge}} posed by radial tire technology, and the varied responses. [...] At the time, the entire <b>U.S.</b> <b>tire</b> industry produced the older bias-ply technology. Estimates to fit the factories with {{a new set of}} machinery and tools for making this new product were between $600 million and $900 million. This was a substantial amount in a low margin business with sales revenue in the low billions.|$|R

5000|$|At the time, the <b>U.S.</b> <b>tire</b> {{industry}} built tires {{based on}} bias ply technology, dating to 1888. In 1946, Michelin developed the radial tire method of construction, which quickly spread in France, Michelin's home country. Because of its superiority in treadlife, handling, safety from blowouts, and fuel economy, {{use of this}} technology quickly spread throughout Europe and Asia. In the <b>U.S.,</b> the bias-ply <b>tire</b> construction persisted, caused by tire and automobile manufacturers in America [...] "concerned about transition costs." [...] In 1968, Consumer Reports, an influential American magazine, acknowledged the superiority of radial construction, and in 1971 the Lincoln Continental Mark III became the first American made car with standard OEM radial tires.|$|R
