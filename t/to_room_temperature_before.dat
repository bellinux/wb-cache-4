5000|$|Optical discs can {{be damaged}} by {{exposure}} to extreme temperatures; direct sunlight may overheat the disc or damage the data layer with UV rays. Exposure to heat and light have different effects on discs with data and metal layers of different composition. In all optical discs high temperatures can cause the substrate to soften and the disc to warp. Ambient heat, heat build-up, and light do little to damage the data layer of a ROM disc as it is made of aluminium; the only known problem occurring with the prolonged exposure of ROM discs to light is [...] "clouding" [...] or [...] "coloring" [...] of the polycarbonate substrate. CD-R, DVD-R, DVD+R, CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW and DVD-RAM discs are all affected {{by exposure to}} ambient heat as well as heat build-up due to direct sunlight. A CD-R’s data layer is made of dye that degrades at high temperatures, becoming less transparent so that pits and lands are read incorrectly, making the data unreadable. UV rays in sunlight are energetic enough to produce a photochemical reaction that changes the optical properties of the dye. RW and RAM discs' data layers are composed of a phase-changing film that is even more sensitive to heat than the dye found in R discs, so that they degrade even faster when subjected to ambient heat or direct sunlight. The phase-changing film in RW and RAM discs is not light-sensitive, and UV rays do not affect the optical properties of the film. After being exposed to freezing temperatures a disc’s separate layers may warm at different speeds, causing separation of the layers. If heated or cooled significantly a disc {{should be allowed to}} return <b>to</b> <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>before</b> use.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{experimental}} study investigates {{the effect of}} specimen shape on residual mechanical properties of polypropylene (PP) fibre self-compacting concrete (SCC) exposed to elevated temperatures from 200 to 600 °C. Various shaping regimes were used including cylindrical and cubical shapes {{for a series of}} durations of 2 and 4 h, and air cooling <b>to</b> the <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>before</b> testing. The <b>temperature</b> determination results prove that the shaping regimes caused an action of “thermal shock” to SCC under elevated temperatures, characterized by a high temperature at fixed time of exposure. The experimental results indicate that, compared cylindrical specimen with cubical one, thermal shock induced by cylindrical shape air cooling caused more severe damage to concrete in terms of greater losses in compressive strength than those with cubical shapes. The fact that the impact of shapes on mechanical properties indicates that shaping could cause thermal shock to specimens, which is in good agreement with the results of the temperature determination.

One manufacturer supplies the following information and advice: When kept unopened in a cool, dry location such as a refrigerator at a temperature of about 55 °F (13 °C), the shelf life of cyanoacrylate will be extended from about one year from manufacture to at least 15 months. If the adhesive is to be used within six months, {{it is not necessary to}} refrigerate it. Cyanoacrylates are moisture-sensitive, and moving from a cool to a hot location will create condensation; after removing from the refrigerator, it is best to let the adhesive reach <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>before</b> opening. After opening, it should be used within 30 days. Open containers should not be refrigerated.

40|$|Background Intrasynovial flexor tendon repairs, {{because of}} {{historically}} unsatisfactory results (referred as “no man’s land”), {{belong to the}} most studied in hand surgery. There are numerous modifications and variations of those repairs. Clinicians’ preference in Croatia is still modified Kessler’s suture with early passive mobilization protocol referred as Kleinert’s protocol. Proven benefits of early active mobilization have inducted new criteria of “perfect suture” especially addressed to ultimate force. In this study we have examined different modifications and variations of modified Kessler’s suture, which could fulfill new criteria. Methods Ninety-three fresh pig trotters were stored at – 20 °C and each was thawed <b>to</b> <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> just <b>before</b> tendons dissection, transsection, suture placement, and testing using dynamometer with constant rate of extension. The total of 93 extensor digiti quarti proprius tendons were repaired under 3. 5 magnification and divided into three main groups of 10 specimens: modified Kessler suture, double modified Kessler suture and intact tendons as a control group, and seven additional groups of 10 - 12 specimens with further variations in type of thread (braided or monofilament), location and number of the knots (interlocked, doubled or out sided knot), and type of peripheral suture (simple "over and over" or cross-stitched). Results The ultimate (maximum) force, maximum elongation, work and time have pointed out significant difference among three main groups but comparation of the seven additional variations did not vary significantly in elongation, work and time except in ultimate force. Conclusions The ultimate force for the chosen basic modification of the double modified Kessler (DMK) was significantly higher then standard modified Kessler. The version of DMK with crossed peripheral suture was the strongest one among all tested variations. This version presumable could achieve, concerning range of force, early active mobilization opposite of the simple “over and over” peripheral stitch. The lowest strength manifested variations with two knots between tendon ends. The variation with interlocked and out sided knots or monofilament tread {{were not statistically significant}} regarding ultimate force. The frequency of suture failure of basic modification of DMK (suture pull out or tendon and/or suture rupture) was equal respecting braided or monofilament thread. ...|$|R

40|$|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, {{commonly}} referred to as MRSA, first emerged from Staphylococcus aureus in the 19602 ̆ 7 s as an organism that was resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin. MRSA is able to colonize the skin, mouth and nares of both humans and animals without causing disease. However, if the bacteria gains entry via a cut or other skin abrasion, it can lead to more serious infections such as pneumonia, meningitis and septicemia. The three main types of MRSA infections currently recognized are hospital associated (HA), community associated (CA) and livestock associated (LA). Recently, MRSA has also been discovered in retail meat products in the United States and other countries throughout the world. This discovery has raised concerns about the possibility of food being a vehicle for MRSA transmission and infection. It has been reported that MRSA can be found in meat processing facilities at any stage of production. Many studies have determined that pork and swine production are the major MRSA reservoirs. The current understanding of how MRSA may be transmitted in the food chain is limited thus preventing proper risk assessment to identify potential hazards to food handlers as well as to consumers. The purpose of this research is to estimate the percent transfer of MRSA from retail pork products to food contact surfaces (cutting board or knife) and to estimate the risk of consumer exposure to MRSA via contact with contaminated products and contaminated food contact surfaces. In order to simulate how these events may occur; pork products were obtained from a local supplier and inoculated with a 4 strain MRSA mixed culture at levels of 10, 100, 1, 000, 10, 000 and 100, 000 CFU/ ml. Products were then analyzed to obtain initial bacterial populations. All products were vacuum- packaged and stored at 5 °C for 2 weeks to simulate normal packaging and distribution. After 2 weeks, products were aseptically removed from the vacuum package and exposed to the transfer surfaces via 2 methods: light exposure to assess the percent transfer of MRSA from product to surface and heavy exposure to assess human exposure from contaminated products and surfaces. In light exposure, samples were laid on the transfer surfaces at <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> for 5 minutes without any additional weight on the product and allowed <b>to</b> sit at <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>before</b> analysis. In heavy exposure, samples were laid on the transfer surface and a 500 g lead donut was placed on top of the product as it was moved across a defined area of the transfer surface. The transfer surfaces then sat for 5 minutes at <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>before</b> being analyzed. 2 It was found that MRSA not only survived on the pork products during 2 weeks of cold storage but was able to transfer to food contact surfaces. This was true for all products tested across all 5 cell concentrations. These results suggest that even when cell concentration is low (≤ 10 CFU/cm 2) human exposure is possible. Even though MRSA may only be present in very small quantities, {{more research is needed to}} determine the infectious dose of MRSA that may be in meat products in order to establish a risk assessment. Public education on safe raw meat handling and cooking practices should be continued as well as education of food handlers until there is a better understanding of the infectious dose of MRSA in raw meat products...|$|R
30|$|A {{mixture of}} MMT and CP (10 : 9 w/w) was heated (2 °C/min) to the melting point of CP and {{maintained}} at that temperature for 6 h. The cooled (<b>room</b> <b>temperature)</b> residue was washed (3 ×) with deionised water and dried (<b>room</b> <b>temperature)</b> <b>before</b> use.|$|R
40|$|The {{variability}} of the abundance in lactobacilli, lactic acid streptococci and yeasts of a kefir grain starter cultivated in partially controlled conditions – milk renewal at <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> and incubation at defined temperature - was quantified. Expressed by the geometric relative {{standard deviations of}} counts repeated over time, it was respectively of 28 %, 443 % and 35 % {{for each of the}} three microbial groups. The origin of the microbial variability observed was ascribed to the heterogeneous medium developed around the grains during fermentation and, for the lactic acid streptococci, even more to the initial conditions of fermentation, probably to parameters linked <b>to</b> milk renewal (<b>room</b> <b>temperature,</b> waiting time at <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>before</b> incubation) ...|$|R
