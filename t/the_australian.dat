5|$|A {{decision}} by the US Army in the mid-2000s to replace all of its CH-47Ds with new-build CH-47Fs by 2017 endangered the viability of <b>the</b> <b>Australian</b> Chinooks. This was because <b>the</b> <b>Australian</b> Army's arrangements for the logistical support of its small fleet of CH-47Ds were heavily leveraged off those for the US Army's large fleet. In response, <b>the</b> <b>Australian</b> Army also established a project to acquire CH-47F Chinooks to replace its CH-47Ds in the mid-2000s. <b>The</b> <b>Australian</b> Government provided initial approval for a CH-47F purchase in September 2007. As part of this decision, the Government chose to procure the helicopters through the US Government's Foreign Military Sales program to minimise potential risks to the schedule and cost of the project.|$|E
