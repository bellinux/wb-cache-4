5|$|Burne-Jones's {{paintings}} were one strand in the evolving tapestry of Aestheticism from the 1860s through the 1880s, which considered that art should be valued {{as an object}} of beauty engendering a sensual response, rather <b>than</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> story or moral implicit in the subject matter. In many ways this was antithetical to the ideals of Ruskin and the early Pre-Raphaelites.|$|E

5|$|A {{thallium}} atom has 81 electrons, {{arranged in}} the electron configuration 4f145d106s26p1; of these, the three outermost electrons {{in the sixth}} shell are valence electrons. Due to the inert pair effect, the 6s electron pair is relativistically stabilised and {{it is more difficult}} to get them involved in chemical bonding <b>than</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> heavier elements. Thus, very few electrons are available for metallic bonding, similar to the neighboring elements mercury and lead, and hence thallium, like its congeners, is a soft, highly electrically conducting metal with a low melting point of 304°C.|$|E

5|$|As {{the race}} reached the lower slopes of Ventoux, Simpsons's team {{mechanic}} Harry Hall, witnessed Simpson, still ill, putting the lid {{back on his}} water bottle as he exited a building.

As the race closed in on the summit of Ventoux, the peloton began to fracture, and for a while, Simpson managed {{to stay in the}} front group of elite riders. He then slipped back to a group of chasers around one minute behind before he began to lose control of his bike and zig-zag across the road. His team manager, Alec Taylor, feared for Simpson less for the way he was going up the mountain <b>than</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> way he would go down the other side.|$|E

5|$|At {{the onset}} of war in Korea, No.77 Squadron was self-supporting, the largest flying unit in the RAAF. It {{comprised}} 299 officers and men, 40 Mustangs, 3 CAC Wirraways, 2 Douglas C-47 Dakotas and 2 Austers. The added burden of combat operations made this situation untenable after the squadron went into action in Korea, leading {{to the formation of}} No.391 (Base) Squadron at Iwakuni, {{at the same time as}} No.91 Wing headquarters. RAAF base squadrons were responsible for administrative, logistical, medical, communications and security functions. Staffed mainly by former No.77 Squadron members, in the first year of its existence No.391 Squadron had to try to overcome severe shortages of winter clothing and equipment. Further problems arose when No.77 Squadron converted to Gloster Meteors between April and July 1951, as spares for the British-made jet were harder to obtain <b>than</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> American Mustang. No longer could No.391 Squadron source parts from the US Fifth Air Force as it had up till this point. Disposal of the Mustangs and their spares also caused headaches; the process took two years, causing storage issues. The base squadron faced another challenge in January 1952, following a controversial change in role for the Meteors, from air-to-air combat to ground attack, which necessitated obtaining supplies of rockets and modification of the aircraft to carry them.|$|E
5|$|Between {{these two}} systems, {{that of the}} {{political}} order predominates in the layout of Ambohimanga, and the sacredness {{of the city was}} historically more explicitly associated with its role as a political rather than an astrological center. The forbidding of foreigners from the site in the 19th century, for instance, was enacted to preserve the sanctity of the social and political order, rather than the religious order. By respecting these systems of symbolism, successive rulers sought to ensure the benediction of the ancestors, strengthen the legitimacy of their rule and ensure the protection and stability of their kingdom. However, adherence to cardinal division and symbolism of space is weaker at Ambohimanga than its embodiment of the significance of vertical space and elevation as an indicator of rank. The site of each new compound within the royal city was selected less for its cardinal direction <b>than</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> extent to which it was located on higher ground than the compound that predated it.|$|E

The Privy Council formerly acted as the High Court of Appeal for the entire British Empire (other <b>than</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom itself), and continues to hear appeals from the Crown Dependencies, the British Overseas Territories, and some independent Commonwealth states.|$|E

5|$|Deep dives {{should be}} made only after a gradual {{training}} to test the individual diver's sensitivity to increasing depths, with careful supervision and logging of reactions. Diving organizations such as Global Underwater Explorers (GUE) emphasize that such sessions are {{for the purpose of}} gaining experience in recognizing the onset symptoms of narcosis for an individual , which are somewhat more repeatable <b>than</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> average group of divers. Scientific evidence does not show that a diver can train to overcome any measure of narcosis at a given depth or become tolerant of it.|$|E
5|$|In 1878 the Cremation Society of Great Britain {{bought an}} {{isolated}} {{piece of the}} LNC's Brookwood land and built Woking Crematorium on the site. The crematorium was completed in 1879 but Richard Cross, the Home Secretary, bowed to strong protests from local residents and threatened to prosecute if any cremations were conducted. As a consequence the crematorium was not used other <b>than</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> experimental incineration of livestock. The 1884 trial of William Price established that human cremation was not unlawful in England, and on 26March 1885 the first human cremation took place at Woking. Although the LNC was hostile {{to the idea of}} cremation, Woking Crematorium was the only operational crematorium in the country. Since the Necropolis Railway provided the easiest way to transport bodies and mourners from London to the Woking area, transport to and from Woking Crematorium soon began to provide a significant source of revenue for the LNC.|$|E

5|$|The Itanium 2 {{processor}} {{was released}} in 2002, and was marketed for enterprise servers rather <b>than</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> whole gamut of high-end computing. The first Itanium2, code-named McKinley, was jointly developed by HP and Intel. It relieved many of the performance problems of the original Itanium processor, which were mostly caused by an inefficient memory subsystem. McKinley contains 221 million transistors (of which 25 million are for logic), measured 19.5mm by 21.6mm (421mm2) and was fabricated in a 180nm, bulk CMOS process with six layers of aluminium metallization.|$|E
5|$|The Moran model assumes {{overlapping}} generations. At {{each time}} step, one individual is chosen to reproduce and one individual is chosen to die. So in each timestep, {{the number of}} copies of a given allele can go up by one, go down by one, or can stay the same. This means that the transition matrix is tridiagonal, which means that mathematical solutions are easier for the Moran model <b>than</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Wright–Fisher model. On the other hand, computer simulations are usually easier to perform using the Wright–Fisher model, because fewer time steps need to be calculated. In the Moran model, it takes N timesteps to get through one generation, where N is the effective population size. In the Wright–Fisher model, it takes just one.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{localized}} for the West by Atlus USA. The project leader was Bill Alexander, the lead translator was Sammy Matsushima, while dialogue editing was handled by Mike Meeker. As with their other localizations such {{as for the}} Persona series, the team tried to stay faithful to the original text. This proved easier <b>than</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Persona series as its fictional setting meant there were no cultural in-jokes {{that would not be}} understood outside Japan. The localization took place from 2006 to 2007: the project was an unusual one for Atlus, as it was an entirely new intellectual property from a studio that was still little known in the West. When tasked with localizing the game for Western markets, the team were told that the game had a Shakespearean feel, so Matsushima created a script that reflected that: with the concept of a play in mind, the dialogue was written to give a noble feel to the characters, in addition to fairy tale elements fitting in with its frame story of a girl reading books. For his part, Meeker read King Lear and A Midsummer Night's Dream to find the correct style for his writing, in addition to reading Beowulf to properly capture the narrative's darker elements.|$|E
