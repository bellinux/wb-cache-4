Mechanical properties of nonwovens related to damage such as failure stress and strain at that stress depend on deformation and damage characteristics of their constituent fibres. Damage of polypropylene-fibre commercial low-density thermally bonded nonwovens in tension was analysed with tensile tests on single fibres, extracted from nonwovens bonded at optimal manufacturing parameters and attached to individual bond points at both ends. The same tests were performed on raw polypropylene fibres that were used in manufacturing of the analysed nonwovens to study quantitatively the effect of manufacturing parameters on <b>tenacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>fibres.</b> Those tests were performed with a wide range of strain rates. It was found that the fibres break at their weakest point, i. e. bond edge, in optimally bonded nonwovens. Additionally, failure stress and strain in tension of a fibre extracted from the fabric were significantly lower than those of virgin fibre. Since damage in nonwovens occurs by progressive failure of fibres, those experiments were used to establish damage initiation and propagation in thermally bonded nonwovens based on polypropylene fibres. Moreover, the results obtained from the experiments are useful to simulate the damage behaviour of nonwoven fabrics...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} {{impacts of}} different seasons of ericulture namely May-June, July-Aug., Sep. -Oct. and Nov. -Dec on {{the qualities of}} erisilk cocoons and erisilk yarn of four different mutant strains of Philosamia ricini Viz; Yellow plain, Yellow zebra, G. B. plain and G. B. zebra have been evaluated under the reeling parameters. Results obtained indicate that the reeling performances of G. B. plain mutant strain is best in the season May-June (summer) followed by July-August (Rainy) and are relatively better in respect of qualities of eri cocoons and eri silk yarn in comparison to two other seasons namely September-October and November-December. The said variations are probably {{on account of the}} fact that May-June followed by July-August seasons provide relatively better and conducive eco-friendly environment to mutant strain than two other seasons of eri culture in respect of cocoon weight, shell weight, shell ratio, filament length of eri silk yarn, rate <b>of</b> eri silk <b>tenacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> and elongation percentage <b>of</b> <b>fibre.</b> The significant variations in relation to four different seasons in the qualities of eri cocoons and eri silk yarn of yellow plain mutant strain of Philosamia ricini (the popular eri silkworm among the four mutant strains) also have been found relatively better in respect of qualities of eri cocoons and eri silk yarn in all the seasons in spite of evident variation on account of genetic variabilities and differences in the genetic make-up of mutant strains...|$|R

Result indicate that among the four different food plants like foliages of castor followed by kesseru have been found evidently better than the foliages of payam and Topiocal in respect of average cocoon weight (gm) 4. 10, 3. 55, 3. 98, 3. 10, Average shell weight (gm) 0. 55, 0. 45, 0. 52, 0. 41, Average shell ratio 13. 91, 12. 0, 13. 0, 11. 55, Average lengt- h of silk yarn (mtrs) 2510, 2350, 2498, 2285, Average size of eri silk (D) 13 D, 11 D, 12 D, 19 D, Average production of eri silk per hr(gm) 13. 70, 12. 50, 13. 10, 11. 95, Average <b>tenacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> (g/d) 14. 0, 11. 0, 12. 0, 10. 0. As far as qualitative differences of all the four food plants in relation to qualities of eri cocoon and eri silk yarn are concerned the castor along with kesseru food plants have achieved the status of supremacy primary food plant and payam and tapioca the states of secondary food plants.

To make the graft copolymerization more efficient and economic, the optimum conditions for graft copolymerization were established. The optimum conditions e. g., monomer concentration, initiator concentration and time for MMA, EMA and MAN were 50. 0, 0. 2 and 90 %, respectively and the temperature was 80 °C for MMA and MAN and 90 °C for EMA. The grafting percentages at optimum condition for MMA, EMA and MAN were 54. 34. 94 and 19. 87 %, respectively. The loss in <b>tenacity</b> <b>of</b> non-modified silk <b>fibre</b> was higher (53. 87 %) than the modified silk (34 - 35 %) after 300 h exposure in sunlight in open air.

40|$|Abstract. Jute fibres were {{subjected}} to a 5 % alkali (NaOH) solution treatment for 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h at 30 °C. An improvement in the crystallinity in the jute fibres increased its modulus by 12 %, 68 % and 79 % after 4, 6 and 8 h of treatment respectively. The <b>tenacity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fibres</b> improved by 46 % after 6 and 8 h treatment and the % breaking strain was reduced by 23 % after 8 h treatment. For the 35 % composites with 4 h treated fibres, the flexural strength improved from 199 × 1 MPa to 238 × 9 MPa by 20 %, modulus improved from 11 × 89 GPa to 14 × 69 GPa by 23 % and laminar shear strength increased from 0 × 238 MPa to 0 × 2834 MPa by 19 %. On plotting the different values of slopes obtained from the rates of improvement of the flexural strength and modulus, against the NaOH treatment time, two different failure modes were apparent before and after 4 h of treatment. In the first region between 0 and 4 h, fibre pull out was predominant whereas in the second region between 6 and 8 h, transverse fracture occurred with a minimum fibre pull out. This observation was well supported by the SEM investigations of the fracture surfaces...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of industrial hemp {{as a source}} of highly valuable textile fi bres is briefly presented through its use for textiles and composites and its increasing cultivated areas in the 21 st century. On the territory of present Slovenia, about 160 ha of agricultural area was cultivated with hemp before WWII, then it quickly began to decline {{and at the end of}} the 1970 s, it was no longer cultivated. Revitalization of industrial hemp in Slovenia with fi eld experiments started already in the years 2000 / 2001 for producing seeds, whereas hemp fi bres were used only as an insulation for buildings. The textile technological properties of hemp fi bres from diff erent varieties grown in Slovenia have not been examined till now. They are important for using hemp fibres in highly valuable textile products. The properties of green hemp fi bres extracted mechanically from non-retted hemp stems of Cannabis sativa L. var. sativa (varieties: Novosadska, Juso- 11, Bialobrzeskie, Unico- B and Beniko) were determined. All the analysed varieties except Beniko had stem height over 200 cm. The highest yield <b>of</b> green <b>fibres</b> was 33. 1 % (Novosadska). The analysed green fibres’ content was 1. 24 – 3. 26 % of ash, 7. 77 – 8. 50 % of moisture regain, 10. 69 – 13. 92 % of water-soluble substances and 8. 45 – 10. 83 % of pectin. Through a biodegradation process of retting green hemp fibres in tap water at temperature 35 °C, 9. 01 – 18. 89 % of dry mass was removed after ten days. Average linear density of green hemp fi bres was very high, around 200 tex. <b>Tenacity</b> <b>of</b> fi bres’ bundles was in the range of 167 – 272 MPa, but <b>tenacity</b> <b>of</b> elementary <b>fibres</b> was 548 – 672 MPa. From the curves of specific stress-strain, it is seen that green hemp fibres from all five varieties had similar superstructure. All analysed green hemp fibres had high linear density and low mechanical properties. For textile application, they should be further processed into finer fibres in order to increase their tensile stress and become also more flexible and soft...|$|R
40|$|The {{motivation}} {{for this study}} was to reduce the consumption of C 2 S when preparing high-viscosity viscose by pre-treating two softwood pulps with enzymes prior to the viscose stages. Reactivity was evaluated in two ways, Fock´s test of the pulp and the gamma number of the viscose solution prior to regeneration. Whilst the reactivity of a pulp that had been subjected to enzyme pretreatment increased according to Fock´s test, it did not increase according to the gamma number. This unexpected difference between the two reactivity tests was investigated. It was concluded that Fock´s test measures the extent to which C 2 S reacts with a pulp sample during a standardized test, whereas the gamma number measures the resulting degree of xanthate substitution on the cellulose backbone. The gamma number was judged to be the more relevant of the two tests, since it reflects the dissolution ability of a pulp in the viscose preparation. A higher gamma number also means that the coagulation time in the spinning process is prolonged; this is beneficial, as {{it can be used to}} increase the <b>tenacity</b> <b>of</b> the viscose <b>fibres.</b> Measuring the reactivity according to Fock´s test, on the contrary, provides more dubious results, as the test has no undisputed correlation to the viscose preparation process...|$|R
40|$|A {{stochastic}} model is introduced for predicting the stress-strain curve of a woollen yarn under longitudinal extension. The important {{features of a}} woollen yarn that are included in this model are the distributions <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> length, diameter and strength, the effect <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> reversals, the variation in linear density and twist {{along the length of}} a yarn, the radial variation in fibre packing, and the non-uniform arrangement <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> in any particular yarn cross-section. The key deformation mechanisms within the model include variation in the stress between and along individual fibres, fibre breakage, fibre slippage, non-uniform strain along the yarn, and twist flow within the extending yarn. It is shown that the model can predict with reasonable accuracy the <b>tenacity</b> <b>of</b> woollen yarns which are made from fibres {{with a wide range of}} properties, and which contain a wide range of twist levels...|$|R
40|$|Weathering {{refers to}} the {{degradation}} <b>of</b> wool <b>fibres</b> that occur during growth from exposure of the fleece to sunlight, water and air. Weathering damage to Merino wool reduces quantities <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> that are harvested, reduces length in both raw and processed wools, reduces spinning performance and dyeing outcomes. This work aimed to aimed to quantify if {{and to what extent}} weathering occurred in 38 lots of commercial dehaired white cashmere and cashmere top sourced from traditional and new origins of production and the extent of any association between weathering and tensile strength properties of the dehaired cashmere and cashmere top. The cashmere was tested for physical properties, bundle tenacity and extension, tristimulus values brightness (Y) and yellowness (Y-Z) and reflectance. Dye uptake was used as an index of weathering. Linear models, relating to weathering, bundle tenacity and Y-Z were fitted to origin and other objective measurements. Mean attributes (range) were: mean fibre diameter, 17. 0  μm (13. 5 – 21. 3  μm); bundle <b>tenacity</b> <b>of</b> tops, 10. 3 cN/tex (8. 3 – 12. 9  cN/tex), for dehaired fibre, 10. 1 cN/tex (9. 1 – 11. 4 cN/tex). Stain uptake varied from 0. 92 to 6. 34  mg/g fibre indicating a six-fold variation in the extent of weathering. Both the extent of weathering and the bundle <b>tenacity</b> <b>of</b> commercial lots of cashmere were affected by the origin of the cashmere. Increased weathering reduced bundle tenacity, bundle extension, increased the yellowness and reduced reflectance of white cashmere. Bundle <b>tenacity</b> <b>of</b> cashmere declined as fibre diameter variability increased from 20 to 22. 5 %. For the samples tested, the cashmere from China, Mongolia, Afghanistan and Iran showed more weathering than cashmere from Australia, New Zealand and the USA. The differences in the extent of weathering and <b>of</b> bundle <b>tenacity</b> between cashmere from different origins were of commercial significance...|$|R

This study aimed {{to quantify the}} production, fibre attributes and dehairing processing <b>of</b> bison <b>fibre</b> produced from bison grazed in north-eastern Victoria. Three age/sex classes were sampled (n = 16) at seven body positions in spring. The fibre growing area was measured. Fibre was tested for diameter distribution, clean washing yield, proportion <b>of</b> fine <b>fibres</b> < 36 µm and fine fibre length, and processed by cashmere dehairing. Bison were 12 years of age, liveweights 160450 kg and had mean <b>fibre</b> growing area <b>of</b> 1. 4 m 2. They produced an average 1184 g (range 5301640 g) <b>of</b> fine <b>fibre</b> with mean fibre diameter 18. 5 µm, clean washing yield 76. 5 %, wax content 9. 8 %, suint content 14. 5 %, clean fine fibre yield 56. 4 %, fine fibre length 37 mm and fibre curvature was 93 /mm. Mid-side fibre had a crimp frequency of 6. 5 /cm and mean resistance to compression of 6. 6 kPa. <b>Fibre</b> had a <b>tenacity</b> <b>of</b> 8. 7 cN/tex and an extension of 39. 3 %.

40|$|The SDL Quickspin System is {{designed}} to allow spinners to quickly evaluate raw cotton and observe its effects on the resulting yarn quality and spinning performance. This work reports {{on the effects of}} several critical processing parameters of the Quickspin System, including navel type, rotor speed, and sliver linear density, on the <b>tenacity</b> <b>of</b> Quickspin yarn. The results show that there are several significant effects of these critical parameters and their interactions on the <b>tenacity</b> <b>of</b> Quickspin yam. The navel type exerts significant effects on the <b>tenacity</b> <b>of</b> Quickspin yam. A higher tenacity, finer Quickspin yarn can be obtained at a lower rotor speed. Reducing the linear density of sliver is beneficial to the <b>tenacity</b> <b>of</b> Quickspin yarn. These findings confirm that the parameter settings of the Quickspin System closely match those of conventional rotor spinning adopted in normal yarn production. From this investigation of the interactions of the critical parameters, optimum settings of the Quickspin System can be obtained and used as a reference for spinners.

Approximate solutions to the Young-Laplace equation were used to develop simple equations for the <b>tenacity</b> <b>of</b> attachment of particles with diameter up to 20 mm. Simple equations for the maximum size of floatable particles were derived as explicit functions of the particle contact angle, the surface tension, the particle density and the mean centrifugal acceleration of turbulent eddies. For the typical particle size and contact angle encountered in flotation, the analysis showed that the bubble size has {{little effect on the}} <b>tenacity</b> <b>of</b> particle attachment. The prediction for the largest size of floatable particles is compared with the experimental data and signifies influence of turbulence on the particle detachment. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V.
