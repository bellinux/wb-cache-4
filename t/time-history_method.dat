The floor spectra are normally {{the result of a}} time-history calculation of building response to ground shaking. However, alternate approximate methods have been suggested by both Kapur and Biggs. As part of a study for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission horizontal floor response spectra were generated and compared by all three methods. The dynamic analyses were performed on a model of the Westinghouse Recycle Fuels Plant Manufacturing Building (MOFFP). Input to the time-history calculations was a synthesized accelerogram whose response spectrum is similar to that in Regulatory Guide 1. 60. The response spectrum of the synthetic ground motion was used as input to the Kapur and Biggs methods. Calculations were performed for both hard (3500 fps) and soft (1500 fps) foundation soils.

40|$|The frequency-response {{curve is}} an {{important}} information for the structural design, but the conventional <b>time-history</b> <b>method</b> for obtaining the frequency-response curve of a multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) system is time-consuming. Thus, this paper presents an efficient technique to determine the forced vibration response amplitudes of a multi-span beam carrying arbitrary concentrated elements. To this end, the "steady" response amplitudes |Y(x) |s of the above-mentioned MDOF system due to harmonic excitations (with the specified frequencies we) are determined by using the numerical assembly method (NAM). Next, the corresponding "total" response amplitudes |Y(x) |t of the same vibrating system are calculated by using a relationship between |Y(x) |t and |Y(x) |s obtained from the single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) vibrating system. It is noted that, near resonance (i. e., we/w≈ 1. 0), the entire MDOF system (with natural frequency w) will vibrate synchronously in a certain mode and can be modeled by a SDOF system. Finally, the conventional finite element method (FEM) incorporated with the Newmark's direct integration method {{is also used to}} determine the "total" response amplitudes |Y(x) |t of the same forced vibrating system from the time histories of dynamic responses at each specified exciting frequency we. It has been found that the numerical results of the presented approach are in good agreement with those of FEM, this confirms the reliability of the presented theory.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study into the {{response}} and seismic safety of three-dimensional multi-storey concrete structures under concurrent orthogonal seismic excitations. It employs the nonlinear <b>time-history</b> <b>method</b> as its analysis tools. Time-history analyses rely heavily on their utilised earthquake records. Accordingly, this study examines the different approaches of selecting earthquake suites and develops a methodology of selecting representative earthquake scenarios. This methodology is credibly implemented in selecting a far- and a near field suites representative of the New Zealand seismic hazard. The study investigates the response of 6 -, 9 - and 12 -storey concrete structures of different n-X-bays × m-Y-bays. Bidirectional responses of these considered structures are examined and consequently the current combination rules are scrutinised. Consequently this study strongly recommends {{the use of the}} 40 -percent combination rule in lieu of the widely used 30 -percent rule; and the use of time-history analysis in lieu of quasi/equivalent static and response modal analysis methods to avoid their strong dependence on combination rules. An intensive study is conducted employing the incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) technique to investigate structural demands of interstorey drifts, lateral storey drifts and storey accelerations. The study utilises the developed far-field suite and identifies the 50 th and 90 th percentile demands. Hence it provides easy-to-use expressions to facilitate rapid calculation of the structural demands and the effects of biaxial interactions. An implementation into the Demand and Capacity Factor Design (DCFD) format is presented that infers confidence in the performance levels of the considered structures. The study also draws attention to the importance of considering storey accelerations as their storey values reach as high as 10 × PGA. A sensitivity study is conducted by repeating the IDA investigation while using the developed near-field suite. Subsequently a comparison between the near- and the far-field results is conducted. The results were markedly similar albeit of less magnitudes until the (seismic hazard) intensity measure IM = Sa(T₁) = 0. 4 g when the near-field results show sudden flat large increase in demands suggesting a brittle collapse. This is attributed to the higher content of the higher mode frequencies contained in near-field ground motions. Finally, the study examines the (vectorial) radial horizontal shear demands in columns and beam-column joints of the previous far- and near-field studies. The combined radial shear demands in corner, edge and internal columns and joints are evaluated that roughly show a square-root proportional relationship with IM that exhibit somewhat brittle failure at IM ≥ 0. 35 g. Shears demands in the (4 -way) internal columns and the (2 -way) corner joints show highest magnitude in their respective class. The results suggest transverse joint shear reinforcement of 1. 5, 1. 0 and 0. 5 of the longitudinal reinforcement of the neighbouring beam respectively for corner, edge and internal joints. An implementation of a proposed practical (and simpler) DCFD format shows satisfactory confidence in columns performance in shear up to IM = 0. 35 g, conversely to joints unsatisfactory performance in shear at the onset of inelastic behaviour (IM > 0. 05 g) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background This {{investigation}} {{characterized the}} time-history {{pattern of the}} free moment (FM) during walking and, additionally, assessed whether walking with either an internally or externally rotated foot position altered the FM's <b>time-history.</b> <b>Methods</b> Force plate and foot kinematic data were acquired simultaneously for 11 healthy subjects (6 males, 5 females) while walking at their self-selected comfortable speed in 3 foot rotation conditions (normal, internal and external). The FM was calculated and normalized by the product of each participant's body weight and height prior to extraction of peak FM, occurrence of peak FM in stance and net relative impulse. Differences in these values across foot rotation conditions were assessed using separate one-way, repeated measures analysis of variance and subsequent pair-wise comparisons. Results The average FM pattern during normal walking exhibits a biphasic shape: resisting inward rotation during approximately {{the first half of}} stance and outward rotation during the latter part of stance. While no differences in peak FM or net relative impulse were observed between the internal foot rotation condition and normal walking, the external foot rotation condition resulted in significantly greater peak FM and relative net impulse in comparison to normal walking. Conclusion The differences in selected FM variables between normal walking and the external foot rotation condition are attributable to individual subject response to walking with an externally rotated foot. In this condition, some subjects displayed a FM pattern that was similar to that recorded during normal walking, while others displayed markedly larger FM patterns that are comparable in magnitude to those reported for running. The larger FM values in these latter subjects are speculated to be a result of excessive transverse plane body movements. Whilst further investigation is warranted regarding the FM time-history characteristics during walking, our results indicate that the FM may provide useful information in assessment of gait. </p...|$|R

This well-recognized convenience is however counter-balanced by a structural response that is generally complex to predict, especially under earthquakes. The design procedures adopted worldwide do not seem to take adequately into account for the key features associated with these structures. From the engineering point of view, racks are designed as moment-resisting steel frames but of an unconventional type because they are characterized by an extensive use of thin-walled cold-formed members. Furthermore, the overall dynamic response is often greatly affected by a non-negligible deterioration of the joint behavior due to large excursions in the plastic range, with the direct consequence that the load carrying capacity is reduced. In this paper, the well-established non-linear <b>time-history</b> (NLTH) <b>method</b> of analysis is combined with the low-cycle fatigue (LCF) damage approach in order to (1) investigate the damage distribution, (2) assess the residual fatigue life and (3) estimate the effective load-carrying capacity after an earthquake.

40|$|The Finite Strip Method (FSM) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{efficient}} methods for structural analysis of bridges, reducing the time required for analysis without affecting the degree of accuracy. The Finite strip method is therefore an ideal platform for the traditional time-consuming dynamic analysis of long span bridges. The dynamic behavior of a continuous long span bridge significantly depends on the properties of all the bridge structural components. However, the current practice of using the finite strip method is limited to the analysis of the bridge deck subjected to simulated boundary conditions over the supports. The interactions between different bridge structures cannot be modeled using conventional methods. In this regard, this study introduces an integrated analytical solution for continuous long span bridges by modeling all the bridge components together, using the spline finite strip method. The Column Strips are developed to model the cantilever-behaved piers and towers, and Cable Strip is developed for the cables in long span bridges. In addition, a special Transition Section is developed to combine different structures in the finite strip environment. By representing the whole bridge as a single integrated system, the actual dynamic behavior of the bridge can be studied using the conventional dynamic analysis method. Moreover, by using the Pseudo Excitation Method (PEM), which is a fast complete quadratic combination algorithm using power spectral density matrix for random responses, the dynamic analysis of a complicated continuous long span structure can be performed in minimal time. In the study, the development of the Column Strips, Cable Strip and the Transition Section are presented, and the application of the <b>time-history</b> analysis <b>method</b> and PEM in the finite strip environment is introduced.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{vehicles}} increasingly challenges existing cost, weight, durability, and handling regimes. This challenge is further compounded by pressure to decrease or limit {{the duration of}} the design cycle. The simulation of vehicle dynamic behavior commonly applies just rigid, or better rigid and linear flexibility models to predict motions and determine load cases. However, as the boundaries of materials are pushed these are becoming insufficient to accurately predict behavior. Alternatively, complete nonlinear finite element representations of vehicle dynamics are always possible but are presently infeasible for the support of a single design under virtual test, not to mention several design iterations. To address these issues, a novel abstract multi-rate simulation method is outlined which is designed to exploit the richness of available model in the vehicle dynamics domain. The method relies on the availability of a virtual continuum of modeling fidelities and uses the fast executing low fidelity models to seed increasingly high fidelity models which execute concurrently in different regions of the time domain.

40|$|Using {{response}} spectrum and <b>time-history</b> analysis <b>methods,</b> {{a thorough investigation}} of the response of bridges subjected to spatially varying support motions is performed. Three main causes of spatial variability are considered: the incoherence effect, which represents random differences in the amplitudes and phases of seismic waves due to reflections and refractions that occur during wave propagation in the heterogeneous medium of the ground and due to differential superposition of waves arriving {{from different parts of}} an extended source; the wave-passage effect, which describes the differences in the arrival times of waves at separate locations; and the site-response effect, which accounts for differences in the intensities and frequency contents of surface motions due to variable soil profiles underneath the supports. The multiple-support {{response spectrum}} (MSRS) method originally developed by Der Ki-ureghian and Neuenhofer (1992) is generalized to allow consideration of response quantities that depend on the support degrees of freedom, and extended to account for quasi-static contributions of truncated modes. Efficient algorithms and a computer code are developed for the implementation of the generalized and extended MSRS method. The code is used for comprehensive parametric analyses of four real bridge models with vastly different characteristics. The analyses identify cases of ground motion spatial variability and types of bridges for which the effects of spatial variability are significant. Methods for simulation of spatially varying ground motion arrays incorporating the effects of incoherence, wave passage and differential site response are developed. The simulated motions inherit statistical characteristics of a specified acceleration record at a reference site. The conditional simulation approach preserves time-history characteristics of the specified record; however, the array of motions exhibits increasing variability with distance from the reference site. The unconditional simulation method generates an array of motions that preserve the overall temporal and spectral characteristics of the specified record and exhibit uniform variability at all locations. The simulated motions are validated by examining their physical compliance and by comparing their response spectra, coherency characteristics and power spectral densities with corresponding target models. Sets of simulated support motions are used to investigate the effect of spatial variability on linear and non-linear bridge response by time-history analyses. Comparisons between linear and non-linear pier drifts are performed to assess the accuracy of the "equal dis-placement" rule (Veletsos and Newmark, 1960) for spatially varying ground motions. Comparisons between mean peak responses obtained from linear time-history and MSRS analyses provide information on the range of errors induced by the approximations involved in the latter method. Finally, coherency analysis of a recorded array of near-fault ground motions is performed. The ability of commonly used models to describe the incoherence component of this array is assessed...|$|R
