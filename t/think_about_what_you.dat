2500|$|At his {{arraignment}} at the District Court of Pittsburg County on June 4, 2002, Duty asked Judge Steven Taylor {{to enter}} a guilty plea to the murder and requested the death penalty, {{against the advice of}} his defense counsel. On October 28 of that year, Duty was deemed competent to enter the plea after court-ordered evaluations by the Carl Albert Community Mental Health Center and Eastern Oklahoma State Hospital. While testifying on his own behalf, Duty declined to present any mitigating evidence and said that he preferred death over spending a life sentence in lockdown 23 hours day. He also wrote to the prosecutor that he would kill again. Mary Wise pleaded to the court to sentence Duty to life in prison without the possibility of parole, stating: [...] "I don't believe he ought to have a choice. I think he ought to sit in that cell and face those four walls and think about what he did {{for the rest of his}} natural-born life. And I hope and pray to God that you live to be 110 years old, because that's how long I want you to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> did." [...] Judge Taylor denied her request, calling Duty a [...] "textbook case for the death penalty". Duty was initially scheduled to be executed on February 24, 2005.|$|E

While recording the album, Pierre strove to sing more softly than {{he had in the}} past, out of fear he would blow his voice out touring the album. He later felt his vocal performances on the album were not his best. He struggled with writer's block during the sessions and found himself writing lyrics while recording the song, which had never happened before. In addition, the band were worried their songs would not be catchy enough after their predecessor was so successful. The album was co-produced by Adam Schlesinger of Fountains of Wayne and Eli Janney of Girls Against Boys. [...] "Adam works ten times faster than most people and he's already onto the next thing before {{you have a chance to}} <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> did, so it was kind of like playing catch up," [...] Pierre later recalled.|$|E

50|$|There is no doubt, however, {{that he is}} {{best known}} to the general {{economics}} profession {{around the world for}} his internationally acclaimed textbook, Elements of Econometrics (titled after Euclid's Elements) which was first published in 1971 and extensively revised in a 1986 second edition. Having been published in Spanish, Portuguese, Persian, and Croatian over the years, it is still available in English today.Initially econometrics was centered on providing essentially standalone solutions to particular problems e.g., a useful analytically and econometrically tractable production function such as the Cobb-Douglas, a formal development of the computationally expedient iterative estimation procedure, and a simple way to estimate the parameters of a mathematically complex function (to characterize the Cobb-Douglas, generalized regression, and CES publication examples cited above). As econometrics matured from a collection of clever solutions for specific problems into its own major field of research, econometricians worked to integrate what was known into a systematic whole greater {{than the sum of its}} parts. In addition to listing what might be called well-solved problems, they made explicit the implied assumptions underlying them, what can be said if the assumptions are not logically valid, and how to obtain useful results in these cases.With his focus on econometrics and a strong background in mathematics and statistics Kmenta was a major contributor to this effort. The book embodies the essence of Kmenta’s approach to both econometrics and statistics which is perhaps best - if informally—characterized as “It’s all very easy once you really understand it - don’t bother memorizing anything, just do the algebra and <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are doing and why. Keep things as simple as possible.” Seemingly obvious, this requires a true gift for exposition as well as fundamental understanding. The book chooses its topics precisely, in a careful progression, fully aware of what the reader knows at each point, and it uses the minimal technical tools to fully analyze each issue - slipping seamlessly between scalar and matrix algebra when the point is more clearly made with one or the other, careful to explicitly show the steps needed to derive the result. The exposition is so successful that the book has been used at the PhD level, the master's degree level, and even in advanced undergraduate courses. This gift for clarity and exposition also makes Kmenta a legendary teacher, one who is able to convey what might otherwise be daunting concepts in a rigorous but readily accessible manner.|$|E
40|$|Slightly {{more than}} 500 people have flown in space, {{most of them}} for short periods of time. The total number of person years in space is small. Given this fact, and given {{rigorous}} astronaut screening, {{it is not surprising}} that the accumulated infectious disease experience in space is also small, and mostly, theoretical. As the human space presence expands, we may expect mission length, total accumulated person years and the environmental complexity to increase. Add to the mix both changes in human immunity and microbial virulence, and it becomes realistic to consider infectious scenarios and the means to mitigate them. This lecture will cover the inhabited space environment from the perspective of host-microbe interactions, current relevant research, and the current countermeasures used. Future challenges will be discussed and there will be opportunity to ask questions about Space Operations.

When the band was first being signed to CBS Records, they refused to sign the band unless Mullen was fired. He was not, and as a result, his drumming became more integrated into the song structures. His experiences in the Artane Boys Band reportedly heavily contributed to the martial beat featured in many of U2s songs, helping to evoke military imagery.|$|R
40|$|Graphic {{designers}} are {{moving away from}} designing artefacts to designing tools, systems and experiences. Industry is now seeking editors, curators and visualisers of digital information. With this shift, new pedagogical challenges have emerged {{in order to ensure}} relevancy of current design curricula within a context of social, political, economic and cultural transformation. This essay explores the dynamics of this relationship, using the example of two eras at the Royal College of Art, London, in which education was reimagined. The first (1948) involved Richard Guyatt’s manifesto for a new kind of teaching in the changed post-war industrial environment, the second is ongoing and stems from a discussion about Guyatt and his contemporary relevancy that happened as part of the 50 -year celebrations of graphic design at the RCA. In particular, it will ask whether Guyatt’s basic tenet of ‘Head, Heart, Hand’ holds true for 2015 and beyond.
