5000|$|In {{practice}} {{this means that}} when measuring <b>threshold</b> with <b>sounds</b> decreasing in amplitude, {{the point at which}} the sound becomes inaudible is always lower than the point at which it returns to audibility. This phenomenon is known as the ‘hysteresis effect’.|$|R
50|$|The {{absolute}} <b>threshold</b> for <b>sound</b> is {{the minimum}} amount of sensation needed to elicit a response from receptors in the ears.

50|$|There {{are cases}} where {{conventional}} PTA {{is not an}} appropriate or effective method of threshold testing. Procedural changes to the conventional test method may be necessary with populations {{who are unable to}} cooperate with the test in order to obtain hearing <b>thresholds.</b> <b>Sound</b> field audiometry may be more suitable when patients are unable to wear earphones, as the stimuli are usually presented by loudspeaker. A disadvantage of this method is that although thresholds can be obtained, results are not ear specific. In addition, response to pure tone stimuli may be limited, because in a sound field pure tones create standing waves, which alter sound intensity within the sound field. Therefore, {{it may be necessary to}} use other stimuli, such as warble tones in sound field testing. There are variations of conventional audiometry testing that are designed specifically for young children and infants, such as behavioral observation audiometry, visual reinforcement audiometry and play audiometry.|$|R

30|$|In general, it is {{difficult}} for a vehicle to determine the plausibility of a reported traffic event solely. In [16] Raya et al. applied message aggregation and group communication to validate a reported traffic event. The main idea is to provide a vehicle more evidence about a reported traffic event by collecting and analyzing multiple incoming messages from different vehicles. The main challenge of this paper is how to dynamically form and maintain a vehicle group with the characteristic of high mobility. The concept of message aggregation is also adopted by Ostermaier et al. in [10]. The authors proposed four voting schemes on local danger warning service. Their simulation results showed that one of the four schemes, called majority of freshest votes with a <b>threshold,</b> <b>sounds</b> promising. However, the dynamics of traffic events and the differences of sensor capabilities may cause some sensors to collect inaccurate information when vehicles pass the same event location. In consequence, it is hard for voting vehicles to achieve an agreement on a reported traffic event and to further evaluate the event correspondingly based on the voting scheme.|$|R

50|$|Softness Imperception (SI) {{is a term}} {{coined by}} Florentine and colleagues to {{describe}} the inability to hear quiet sounds that are audible to normal listeners.

40|$|OBJECTIVE : Evaluation of the Sennheiser HD 202 II supra-aural {{headphones}} as {{an alternative}} headphone to enable more affordable hearing screening. DESIGN : Study 1 measured the equivalent <b>threshold</b> <b>sound</b> pressure levels (ETSPL) of the Sennheiser HD 202 II. Study 2 evaluated the attenuation of the headphones. Study 3 determined headphone characteristics by analyzing the total harmonic distortion (THD), frequency response and force of the headband. STUDY SAMPLE : Twenty-five participants were included in study 1 and fifteen in study 2 with ages ranging between 18 and 25. No participants were involved in study 3. RESULTS : The Sennheiser HD 202 II ETSPLs (250 – 16000 Hz) showed no significant effects on ETSPL for ear laterality, gender or age. Attenuation was not significantly different (p> 0. 01) to TDH 39 except at 8000 Hz (p 3 %. CONCLUSION : Sennheiser HD 202 II supra-aural headphones {{can be used as}} an affordable headphone for screening audiometry provided reported MPANLs, maximum intensities and ETSPL values are employed.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of Ontario’s Green Energy Act in 2009 (1), designed {{to rid the}} province of air-polluting, coal-fired electricity generators, resulted in forests of giant wind turbine electrical generators springing up over the rural landscape of south-western Ontario.

Some people have abandonned their homes of many years because of the continual assault of the LFN. Protests multiplied across the province.

40|$|A multi-stressor risk {{assessment}} {{was conducted at}} Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, as {{a demonstration of the}} Military Ecological Risk Assessment Framework. The focus of the assessment was a testing program at Cibola Range, which involved an Apache Longbow helicopter firing Hellfire missiles at moving targets, that is, M 60 -A 1 tanks. This article focuses on the wildlife {{risk assessment}} for the helicopter overflight. The primary stressors were sound and the view of the aircraft. Exposure to desert mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus crooki) was quantified using Air Force sound contour programs NOISEMAP and MR NMAP, which gave very different results. Slant distance from helicopters to deer was also used as a measure of exposure that integrated risk from sound and view of the aircraft. Exposure-response models for the characterization of effects consisted of behavioral <b>thresholds</b> in <b>sound</b> exposure level or maximum sound level units or slant distance. Available <b>sound</b> <b>thresholds</b> were limited for desert mule deer, but a distribution of slant-distance thresholds was available for ungulates. The risk characterization used a weight-of-evidence approach and concluded that risk to mule deer behavior from the Apache overflight is uncertain, but that no risk to mule deer abundance and reproduction is expected.

40|$|Mosquitoes hear {{with their}} antennae, which in most species are sexually dimorphic. Johnston, who {{discovered}} the mosquito auditory organ {{at the base of}} the antenna 150 years ago, speculated that audition was involved with mating behaviour (1). Indeed, male mosquitoes are attracted to female flight-tones (2 - 4). The male auditory organ has been proposed to act as an acoustic filter for female flight-tones, but female auditory behaviour is unknown (5). We show, for the first time, interactive auditory behaviour between males and females that leads to sexual recognition. Individual males and females both respond to pure-tones by altering wing-beat frequency. Behavioural auditory tuning curves, based on minimum <b>threshold</b> <b>sound</b> levels that elicit a change in wing-beat frequency to pure tones, are sharper than the mechanical tuning of the antennae, with males being more sensitive than females. We flew opposite-sex pairs of tethered Toxorhynchites brevipalpis and found that each mosquito alters its wing-beat frequency in response to the flight-tone of the other, so that within seconds their flight-tone frequencies are closely matched, if not completely synchronised. The flight-tones of same-sex pairs may converge in frequency but eventually diverge dramatically...|$|E
40|$|Pile {{driving is}} {{presently}} {{the most common}} method used to attach wind turbines to the sea bed. To {{assess the impact of}} pile driving sounds on harbor porpoises, {{it is important to know}} at what distance these sounds can be detected. Using a psychophysical technique, a male porpoise’s hearing thresholds were obtained for series of five pile driving sounds (inter-pulse interval 1. 2 – 1. 3 s) recorded at 100 and 800 m from the pile driving site, and played back in a pool. The 50 % detection <b>threshold</b> <b>sound</b> exposure levels (SELs) for the first sound of the series (no masking) were 72 (100 m) and 74 (800 m) dB re 1 uPa 2 s.

40|$|At present, the {{fundamental}} frequencies of signals of most commercially available acoustic alarms to deter small cetaceans are below 20 kHz, {{but it is}} not well ascertained whether higher frequencies have a deterrent effect on bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Two captive bottlenose dolphins housed in a floating pen were subjected to a continuous pure tone at 50 kHz with a source level of 160 2 dB (re 1 Pa, rms). The behavioral responses of dolphins were judged by comparing surfacing distance relative to the sound source, number of surfacings, and number of echolocation clicks produced, during forty 15 min baseline periods with forty 15 min test periods (four sessions per day, 40 sessions in total). On all 10 study days, surfacing distance and the number of surfacings increased while click production decreased during broadcasts of test sound. The avoidance <b>threshold</b> <b>sound</b> pressure level for a continuous 50 kHz tone for the bottlenose dolphins, {{in the context of this}} study, was estimated to be 144 2 dB (re 1 Pa, rms).
