Their relative importance varies from species to species, which is most likely to be {{due to the nature of}} the exoskeletons (which influences the rate of solar radiation absorption), size (which influences rate of warming and power requirements) and behaviour.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{various aspects of}} soil {{compaction}} due to agricultural field traffic, the draught force requirement of tillage implements and soil structures produced by tillage. Several field experiments were carried out to study the mechanical impact of agricultural machines. It was shown that the stress interaction from the different wheels in dual and <b>tandem</b> <b>wheel</b> configurations is small and these wheels can be considered separate wheels with regard to soil stress. Hence, soil stress {{is not related to}} either axle load or total vehicle load. At high wheel load, tyre inflation pressure affected subsoil stresses. The maximum stress at the soil-tyre interface was greater than the tyre inflation pressure. Furthermore, the distribution of stress beneath tyres and rubber belts was highly non-uniform. This was shown to have a great influence on stress propagation in soil. Therefore, with regard to soil compaction modelling, a uniform stress distribution (as often used) is too poor an approximation of the real stress distribution and can result in underestimation of soil compaction. A model for predicting the distribution of stress below tyres using readilyavailable tyre parameters is proposed. With a more realistic approximation of the stress distribution at the soil surface, simulated stresses generally agreed well with measure...|$|E

40|$|Ultra-thin Whitetopping (UTW) {{involves}} {{placing a}} very thin concrete overlay 50 mm to 100 mm thick (2 ”- 4 ”) on the milled surface of a distressed asphalt pavement. To investigate the performance of UTW placed over a flexible pavement subjected to slow and heavy moving wheel loads, whitetopping mixes were placed over a milled pavement surface in the Accelerated Pavement Testing (APT) facility of the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) Research Division in West Lafayette Indiana {{in the fall of}} 1999. The UTW installation experiment consisted of four test ‘lanes’ of two different thicknesses; each utilizing plain and fiber reinforced concrete. The test ‘lanes’ were instrumented using strain gages, Variable Differential Transducers (LVDTs) and thermocouples to measure the strains, deflections, and to monitor the pavement temperatures respectively. The test ‘lanes’ were subjected to both static and dynamic <b>tandem</b> <b>wheel</b> loads of varying magnitudes. In addition, one of the test ‘lanes’ was also exposed to thermal load by applying a temperature gradient to the pavement. A mix design for the UTW was developed based on literature survey of previous UTW projects. The mechanical properties of concrete were evaluated in the laboratory before the UTW pavements were constructed at the APT facility. The pavements were monitored continuously during the testing period and the dynamic-load strains during the motion of the wheel, as well as the static strains due to the stationary wheel load were recorded. This data was analyzed to determine the maximum strains and their location, the degree of bonding between the UTW overlay and the underlying asphalt and the pavement performance under repeated loading. In addition, non-destructive test method was utilized to evaluate the pavement condition after the accelerated pavement testing was completed. In addition, cores obtained from the pavement were subjected to shear force to determine the quality of the bond. A three-dimensional finite element model was developed using a general finite element code, ABAQUS, to conduct an analysis of the response of the composite pavement to the wheel loads. The principal goal was to develop a simple and reliable model using reasonable geometry, boundary conditions and material properties, to verify the pavement response observed experimentally.

40|$|The major {{unsteady}} aerodynamic {{forces and}} major physics of a generic single <b>wheel</b> and <b>tandem</b> <b>wheels</b> are studied {{for the first time}} using wind tunnel tests. The wind-tunnel tests are performed in the 2. 1 m × 1. 5 m wind tunnel at the University of Southampton. The tandem-wheel configuration consists of two in-line wheels that can be tested at different inter-axis distances and various installation angles. A vibration test is performed in situ on the model assembly to validate the unsteady-load measurements. Mean and unsteady aerodynamic loads and on-surface pressures are measured. Particle Image Velocimetry is used to acquire the velocity fields in the wake downstream of the model and surface oil-flow technique is used to identify the flow features {{on the surface of the}} wheels. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition is also used to characterise the wake in terms of unsteady fluctuations. The results of the experiments on the <b>tandem</b> <b>wheels</b> show that higher values of inter-axis distance correspond to slightly higher total mean drag coefficients and remarkably lower drag coefficient RMS values. Higher installation angles are associated with higher mean drag coefficients but generally lower fluctuations of the force coefficients.

40|$|The major {{features}} and {{physics of the}} aerodynamic interactions between various main components of a generic four-wheel landing gear are studied. The study was conducted {{as a part of}} the UK ATI ALGAAP (Advanced Landing Gear Aero-loads and Aero-noise Prediction) project. Delayed Detached-Eddy Simulations with the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model with fixed laminar-turbulent transition are performed to compare three configurations of landing-gear components. The wheel geometry is the same as in the tandem-wheel configuration that was previously studied for the ALGAAP project. For this geometry both simulations and experiments are available for validation and comparison with the current results on the four-wheel bogie. The effect of the fixed transition are also assessed on the four-wheel geometry and compared with the <b>tandem</b> <b>wheels.</b> The results show strong effects of the axles and the bogie beam on the low past the wheels. The axles generate a wide low-pressure wake in the aft part of the front wheels, which increases the mean drag coefficient of the front wheels. The flow features observed on the three configurations show some similarities with the flow features that were reported on <b>tandem</b> <b>wheels,</b> with a few differences. Adding axles and bogie beam increases the mean drag significantly on the front wheels, and slightly on the downstream wheels. Adding a main strut reduces the mean drag of the downstream wheels, but the mean drag of the front wheels slightly increases. A similar trend is seen with the RMS.

The aims of the experiment are {{to gain a better understanding}} of the flow past simple landing-gear components and to generate a CFD validation database. Since the model is designed to study basic landing-gear components, the wheel geometry is simplified, with no detailed elements in the assembly. The tandem-wheel configuration is formed of two in-line wheels that can be tested at different inter-axis distances and various angles of attack. Mean and unsteady data of aerodynamic loads and on-surface pressures are measured. A vibration test is performed in situ on the model assembly to validate the unsteady-load measurements. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is used to acquire the velocity fields in the wake downstream of the model. The results highlight the low sensitivity of the measured quantities to the three versions of the wheel hub on the single wheel. The mean drag coefficients of the <b>tandem</b> <b>wheels</b> show a low sensitivity to the inter-axis distance, which has stronger effects on the mean lift coefficients and the unsteady aerodynamic loads. The angle of attack determines relevant changes in both mean and unsteady quantities. The pressures on the wheel surface are used for gaining a better understanding of the flow regimes and the effect of tripping the flow. Additionally, the PIV data are used to compare the velocity profiles in the wake and identify the wake vortical structures. <br/...|$|R
