5|$|According to the manufacturer, the Xerxes.20plus {{incorporates}} key design {{elements from}} the TMS3, including the tungsten carbide bearing ball, {{inner and outer}} aluminium platter, mat and decoupler blobs. The isolation between the plinth layers of the 20 has been improved for the Plus. The bearing is of a higher quality; the platter and sub-platter have been redesigned. A mat with distinctive cut-outs {{is placed on the}} platter assembly to support the disc. While the <b>top</b> <b>board</b> sits on decoupling blobs, the lower half has bright polished-metal feet. The bearing ball, Blobs and mat are available to existing owners for retrofitting their legacy Xerxes.10 and Xerxes.20 turntables.|$|E

25|$|The University of East Anglia is infamous for two new hats {{designed}} by Cecil Beaton that were prescribed.

These caps were unpopular with students who preferred the square cap and they soon fell into disuse. The tricorn is still used as the official hat of the Registrar and the Dan Dare is still officially prescribed for undergraduates; however, because undergraduate gowns are extremely rarely, if ever, worn pressure for abolition of the cap has not occurred.|$|E

25|$|The {{door frame}} for this opening is highly altered {{in almost every}} detail with the {{exception}} of the basic size. The door itself may be original but is almost certainly of old if not of colonial origin. It consists of a pair of narrow, white battened doors opening at the center. Each door has a pair of vertical recessed panels on the top and bottom half, comprising four panels on each door. The brick arch is obviously a replacement, but the wooden door trim consisting of two vertical frames surmounted by a horizontal board bearing a chamfer and lamb’s tongue molding may be of colonial age. The vertical frame members extend beyond the lintel to the bottom of the brick arch. The space between the arch and the <b>top</b> <b>board</b> is filled with flat plaster. The sill is a simple wooden one. In all likelihood, this opening had a pediment of unknown appearance in colonial days. It is the only door in the church that has a lock and key. These are of modern origin.|$|E
500|$|A second {{challenge}} {{was how to}} overcome {{the rotation of the}} suspended parts – the sub-chassis, platter, arm and cartridge – relative to the motor. This was done by re-imagining a suspension that had less freedom of lateral movement relative to the drive motor. The Xerxes uses a relatively light medium-density fibreboard (MDF) <b>top</b> <b>board</b> on which the bearing and tonearm assemblies are mounted. Firm rubber [...] "Blobs" [...] mounted on the bottom board (along with the motor assembly) support yet decouple from the <b>top</b> <b>board.</b> Aesthetically, the two boards are encased by a wooden surround fixed to the base board with screws. These design principles can be seen throughout the evolution of the Xerxes, right through to the Xerxes 20plus.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} Xerxes {{design is}} deliberately {{a radical departure}} from the traditional suspended sub-chassis design. Instead of having a three-point sprung suspension separating the plinth from the sub-chassis, the Xerxes is made up of two boards separated from each other by stiff rubber [...] "Blobs". The top plinth sees mountings for the main bearing and tonearm. A hole is cut out from the <b>top</b> <b>board</b> for the motor assembly to emerge from its fixture on the board below. On the lower board, to which an outer surround is attached, three compliant rubber feet give additional isolation to the turntable's chosen placement. One notable characteristic of the deck is the large C-shaped groove cut into the top plinth to control how vibrations would be transmitted from platter to the tonearm area. However, the cut-out is prone to a commonly observed [...] "plinth sag", where the part of it would bend out of true {{with the rest of the}} board.|$|E
