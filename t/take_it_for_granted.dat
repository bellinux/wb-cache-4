5|$|On December 15, 2015, Heyward {{signed an}} eight-year, $184 million {{contract}} with the Cubs. One of his first acts after signing his contract was to pay for hotel suites {{large enough to accommodate}} teammate David Ross, his wife, and their three young children on all of the Cubs' road trips during the 2016 season. Ross, set to retire after the 2016 season, had been Heyward's teammate during his first three seasons in Atlanta, and Heyward considered him a key mentor in his early MLB career. In an interview with the Bleacher Report website, Heyward said,I know how special it is to have teammates like he was my first three years in Atlanta. You don't <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted.</b> I wanted to say thank you {{from the bottom of my}} heart, as a teammate and as a friend, for what he's done for me.|$|E
25|$|In Chullin 92a-b Ulla {{says that}} here are 30 laws which {{the sons of}} Noah took upon themselves. However he only lists three, namely the three that the Gentiles follow: not to create a Ketubah between males, not to sell carrion {{in the market and}} to respect the Torah. The rest of the laws are not listed. Talmud {{commentator}} Rashi remarks on this that he does not know the other Commandments that are referred to. Though the authorities seem to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> that Ulla's thirty commandments included the original seven, an additional thirty laws is also possible from the reading. Two different lists of the 30 laws exist. Both lists include an additional twenty-three mitzvot which are subdivisions or extensions of the seven laws. One from the 16th-century work Asarah Maamarot by Rabbi Menahem Azariah da Fano and a second from the 10th century Samuel ben Hofni which was recently published from his Judeo-Arabic writings after having been found in the Cairo Geniza. Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Chajes suggests Menahem Azariah of Fano enumerated commandments are not related to the first seven, nor based on Scripture, but instead were passed down by oral tradition.|$|E

500|$|As widely anticipated, [...] "I See the Light" [...] was {{nominated}} for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 83rd Academy Awards in 2011, becoming Menken's nineteenth Academy Award nomination. Menken said of the accomplishment, [...] "I don’t <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> at all". However, the song ultimately lost to Randy Newman's [...] "We Belong Together" [...] from Toy Story 3 (2010), another animated feature film released by Walt Disney Pictures, produced by Pixar Animation Studios. Previously, [...] "I See the Light" [...] had garnered a Golden Globe nomination for Best Original Song at the 68th Golden Globe Awards in 2011, which it lost to"You Haven't Seen the Last of Me" [...] from Burlesque (2010), written by Diane Warren and performed by Cher. Lastly, [...] "I See the Light" [...] {{was nominated}} for Best Song at the 16th Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards in 2011, losing to [...] "If I Rise" [...] from 127 Hours (2010).|$|E
500|$|The {{journalist}} Jeff Simon described Hoffman as [...] "probably {{the most}} in-demand character actor of his generation", but Hoffman claimed never to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> {{that he would}} be offered roles. Although he worked hard and regularly, he was humble about his acting success, and when asked by a friend if he was having any luck he quietly replied, [...] "I'm in a film, Cold Mountain, that has just come out." [...] Patrick Fugit, who worked with Hoffman on Almost Famous, recalled the actor was intimidating but an exceptional mentor and influence in [...] "a school-of-hard-knocks way", remarking that [...] "there was a certain weight that came with him". Hoffman admitted that he sometimes appeared in big-budget studio films for the money, but said, [...] "ultimately my main goal is to do good work. If it doesn't pay well, so be it." [...] He kept himself grounded and invigorated as an actor by attempting to appear on stage once a year.|$|E

2500|$|In The Rights Revolution, Ignatieff {{identifies}} {{three aspects}} of Canada's approach {{to human rights}} that give the country its distinctive culture: 1) On moral issues, Canadian law is secular and liberal, approximating European standards more closely than American ones; 2) Canadian political culture is social democratic, and Canadians <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> that citizens {{have the right to}} free health care and public assistance; 3) Canadians place a particular emphasis on group rights, expressed in Quebec's language laws and in treaty agreements that recognize collective aboriginal rights. [...] "Apart from New Zealand, no other country has given such recognition to the idea of group rights," [...] he writes.|$|E
2500|$|Searle {{notes that}} (in this simple {{version of the}} reply) the [...] "system" [...] {{is nothing more than}} a {{collection}} of ordinary physical objects; it grants the power of understanding and consciousness to [...] "the conjunction of that person and bits of paper" [...] without making any effort to explain how this pile of objects has become a conscious, thinking being. Searle argues that no reasonable person should be satisfied with the reply, unless they are [...] "under the grip of an ideology;" [...] In order for this reply to be remotely plausible, one must <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> that consciousness can be the product of an information processing [...] "system", and does not require anything resembling the actual biology of the brain.|$|E
2500|$|An {{element in}} the debate {{regarding}} the play's misogyny, or lack thereof, is the Induction, and how {{it relates to the}} Katherina/Petruchio story. According to H.J. Oliver, [...] "it has become orthodoxy to claim to find in the Induction the same 'theme' as {{is to be found in}} both the Bianca and the Katherine-Petruchio plots of the main play, and to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> that identity of theme is a merit and 'justifies' the introduction of Sly." [...] For example, Geoffrey Bullough argues the three plots [...] "are all linked in idea because all contain discussion of the relations of the sexes in marriage." [...] Richard Hosley suggests the three plots form a unified whole insofar as they all deal with [...] "assumptions about identity and assumptions about personality." [...] Oliver, however, argues that [...] "the Sly Induction does not so much announce the theme of the enclosed stories as establish their tone." ...|$|E

2500|$|Newhart {{discontinued}} {{the series}} in 1978 after six seasons and 142 episodes. Wallace said of its ending, [...] "It was much crying and sobbing. It was so sad. We really did get along. We really had great times together." [...] Of Newhart's other long-running sitcom, Newhart, Wallace said, [...] "But {{some of the}} other great comedic talents who had a brilliant show, when they tried to do it twice, it didn't always work. And that's what... but like Bob, as far as I'm concerned, Bob is like the Fred Astaire of comics. He just makes it look so easy, and he's not as in-your-face as some might be. And so, you just kind of <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted,</b> how extraordinarily funny and how he wears well." [...] She was later reunited with Newhart twice, once in a reprise of her role as Carol on Murphy Brown in 1994, and on an episode of Newhart's short-lived sitcom, George & Leo, in 1997.|$|E
2500|$|Gladwell's third book, Outliers, {{published}} in 2008, examines how a person's environment, {{in conjunction with}} personal drive and motivation, affects his or her possibility and opportunity for success. Gladwell's original question revolved around lawyers: [...] "We <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> that there's this guy in New York who's the corporate lawyer, right? I just was curious: Why is it all the same guy?", referring {{to the fact that}} [...] "a surprising number of the most powerful and successful corporate lawyers in New York City have almost the exact same biography". In another example given in the book, Gladwell noticed that people ascribe Bill Gates's success to being [...] "really smart" [...] or [...] "really ambitious". He noted that he knew {{a lot of people who}} are really smart and really ambitious, but not worth 60 billion dollars. [...] "It struck me that our understanding of success was really crude — and there was an opportunity to dig down and come up with a better set of explanations." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sowell's 1987 book A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles was laudingly {{reviewed}} by Charles Murray for the National Review, eighteen years after publication. [...] "One {{mark of a}} great book" [...] Murray said, [...] "is a thesis so powerful that {{after a few years}} people <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted.</b> Thomas Sowell's A Conflict of Visions (1987) is such a book. Its thesis: The policy arguments between liberals and conservatives, socialists and libertarians, do not arise just from differences in priorities regarding freedom, equality, and security. At root, they draw from different conceptions of the nature of man." [...] Murray concluded [...] "A Conflict of Visions gives us an intellectual framework that must shape an attentive reader's {{way of looking at the}} political world forever after. But I cannot celebrate it without pointing out that this is just one of over 30 Sowell books to date, and not necessarily the one that his biographers will designate his most important... Sowell is still at work, but his intellectual legacy is already staggering in its combination of breadth and depth. He is a national treasure." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rathbone {{was also}} one to dismiss the {{complaints}} {{in an interview with}} MTV, saying, [...] "I think it's {{one of those things where}} I pull my hair up, shave the sides, and I definitely need a tan. It's one of those things where, hopefully, the audience will suspend disbelief a little bit." [...] The controversy was poorly received by critics as well. Film critic Roger Ebert was one of the critical voices against the casting. When asked about casting a white cast to portray the characters, he said, [...] "The original series Avatar: The Last Airbender was highly regarded and popular for three seasons on Nickelodeon. Its fans <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> that its heroes are Asian. Why would Paramount and Shyamalan go out of their way to offend these fans? There are many young Asian actors capable of playing the parts." [...] Jevon Phillips of the Los Angeles Times noted that despite Shyamalan's attempts to defuse the situation, [...] "this is definitely not an issue that will fade away or be overlooked" [...] and that this film exemplifies the need for a debate within Hollywood about racial diversity in its films.|$|E
2500|$|Domingo {{shows in}} her {{projects}} that her comic touch {{is still very}} much apparent as she delivers one-liners that elicit cheers from the appreciative crowd. According to Philippine Entertainment Portal, she gives no exaggeration in her roles, be it as a popular actress or a weary mother. Considering how her past films are, her acting styles just grabbed the audience senseless and ended up picking themselves up after rolling on the floor laughing. Domingo has a wide range of acting skill, from full-on hysterical to completely flat-line dramatic acting. According to her, [...] "...everybody has a gift, some are developed. But the truly gifted are born with it. But they should never <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted.</b> Acting workshops can help, but practice and exposure and training constitute the real deal...". She further added that her theater experience has given her the medium for her acting styles. According to GMA News, Domingo brings her signature style to her movies especially on the musical [...] as a no-nonsense yet loving mother. Also, as the stronger maternal figure, she gets to show it with some of the movie's best lines. Her timing on delivering her long lines also adds to her special aura as a comedian, and often steal spotlights because of her witty lines. Her humorous quips never fail to elicit thunderous laughter from the audience because she plays her character to maximum comedic effect.|$|E
2500|$|Feige {{stated that}} Marvel {{had been working}} to add Spider-Man to the Marvel Cinematic Universe since at least October 2014, when they {{announced}} their full slate of Phase Three films, saying, [...] "Marvel doesn't announce anything officially until it's set in stone. So we went forward with that Plan A in October, with the Plan B being, if [...] were to happen with Sony, how it would all shift. We've been thinking about [...] as long as we've been thinking about Phase Three." [...] It was said that Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach, producers for the Amazing Spider-Man series, would serve as executive producers, and neither director Marc Webb nor actor Andrew Garfield would return for the new film. Sony was reportedly looking for an actor younger than Garfield to play Spider-Man, with Logan Lerman and Dylan O'Brien considered front-runners. In March 2015, Drew Goddard was being considered to write and direct the film, while O'Brien {{said he had not}} been approached for the role. Goddard, who was previously attached to Sony film based on the Sinister Six, later said he declined to work on the new film as he thought he [...] "didn't really have an idea" [...] for it, adding [...] "it's very hard to say, 'Ok, now write a new movie,'" [...] after spending a year working on the Sinister Six film and being in that mindset. The next month, while promoting , Feige said the character of Peter Parker would be around 15 to 16 years old in the film, which would not be an origin story, since [...] "there have been two retellings of that origin in the last [...] we are going to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> that people know that, and the specifics." [...] Parker's Uncle Ben is referenced in the film, but not by name. Later in April, Nat Wolff, Asa Butterfield, Tom Holland, Timothée Chalamet, and Liam James were under consideration by Sony and Marvel to play Spider-Man, with Holland and Butterfield the front-runners.|$|E
