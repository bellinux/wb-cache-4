5000|$|The Theatre of Eternal Music is a <b>multi-media</b> {{performance}} <b>group</b> who, in its 1960s-1970s heyday included {{at various}} times La Monte Young, Marian Zazeela, Tony Conrad, Angus MacLise, Terry Jennings, John Cale, Billy Name, Jon Hassell, Alex Dea and others, each from various backgrounds (classical composition and performance, painting, mathematics, poetry, jazz, etc.). Operating {{from the world of}} lofts and galleries in New York in the mid-sixties to the mid-seventies in particular, and tied to the aesthetics of Fluxus and the post-John Cage-continuum, the group gave performances on the East Coast of the United States as well as in Western Europe. These performances comprised long periods of sensory inundation with combinations of harmonic relationships, which moved slowly from one to the next by means of [...] "laws" [...] laid out by Young regarding [...] "allowable" [...] sequencies and simultaneities, perhaps in imitation of Hindustani classical music which he, Zazeela and the others either studied or at least admired. The group released nothing during their lifetime (although Young and Zazeela issued a collaborative LP in 1969, and Young contributed in 1970 one side of a flexi-disc accompanying Aspen magazine). The concerts themselves were influential on their own upon the art world including Karlheinz Stockhausen (whose Stimmung bears their influence most strikingly) and the drone-based minimalist works of dozens of other composers many of whom made parallel innovations including Young classmate Pauline Oliveros, or Eliane Radigue, Charlemagne Palestine, Yoshi Wada, Phill Niblock and many others. Group member John Cale extended and popularized this work in 1960s rock music with the Velvet Underground (along with songwriter Lou Reed).|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of his artistic career, which has lasted for more than fifty years now, Vladan Radovanović (b. Belgrade, 1932) has created works in the domains of electroacoustic music, mixed electronics, metamusic, visual arts artifugal projects, tactile art, literature, {{drawings}} of dreams, polymedial and vocovisual projects, as well as art theory. Central to his poetics is the theme of synthesic art. Based on a synthesis of the arts and a fusion of media, the flow of his opus disturbs the limitations of art. His synthesis of media-lines is neither a product of rational decision, nor is it inspired by the works of other artists. Its initial form appears {{in the mind of the}} artist as a sensation or a representation that emerges from sleep and dream or from his exploration of the mysteries of his inner being. In an attempt to create a classification of the arts that would suit his understanding of the nature of art, Radovanović has suggested a basic division into single-media and multi-media arts. Single-media arts include music, poetry and painting, whereas the remaining arts belong to the <b>multi-media</b> <b>group.</b> The latter contains works created by an expansion of mixed forms such as theatre, opera and ballet, but in which the media involved accomplish greater integrity - mixedmedia (for example: happening, fluxus etc) multimedia (opera, film, environment) and intermedia (a term which possesses two meanings: a new media that is in-between media, or a new media in which all the elements are equal and integrated). Radovanović prefers the second meaning, but he uses the term polymedia for such works. This term is analogous to polyphony, because Radovanović has aimed to create a polymedia form in which separate media lines would be treated in counterpoint, in order to remain complementary and mutually dependant. In 1957, Radovanović began to sketch his theoretical thesis, initiated by his concrete artistic output. Although he had distinguished his diverse artistic output according to formal and designative characteristics, later he subordinated his work to the term synthesis art. Synthesic art is, according to Radovanović, one of the models of multi-medial arts. We have analyzed the works of Vladan Radovanović, which do indeed belong to the category of synthesic art, on many levels. First of all we tried to locate his opus in the context of Serbian and European art. Radovanović's avant-garde poetics was born in the context of Serbian art in the second half of the 20 th century, which was dominated by 'moderate modernism'. His works did not fit into the existing world of art, and therefore were marginalized and underestimated. Despite his innovative spirit, hunger for novelty, and aim to transcend the materiality of materials, which are all characteristics of high-modern avant-garde poetics, Radovanović claims autonomy. His latest works do not fit into the current world of art either, because he does not want to place his poetics in the domain of contemporary post-modern poetics and theories. His intentional evasion of fashionable currents is a product of his conscience, which asks that he remain faithful to himself and his inner artistic vision. Another theoretical challenge when addressing the works of this artist was to locate his synthesic art within the larger historical and contemporary manifestations of the total world of art, especially where his works compare with Richard Wagner's Gesamtkunstwerk. Radovanović believes that his concept of synthesic art is similar to Gesamtkunstwerk, but in no way equal. Therefore, we have examined all the controversies about the usage of the term Gesamtkunstwerk, as well as different theoretical approaches to this concept and its evolution; then, we have analyzed it in terms of the theoretical and practical realization of synthesic art. By formulating in detail his theory of synthesic art, Radovanović has given us a key for the understanding and analysis of his works of art. For example, we have analyzed several of his earlier multi-media works (Dreams, vocovisual works Desert (Pustolina), Polyaedar, Ball, Change and Vocovisual omages, and polymedia projects Electrovideoaudio, Building of Rooms-Signs, The Great Sounding Tactyzone, Polim 2, Polim 3, video-work Variations for TV) as well as one of his latest synthesic works, Constellations, in order to describe the practical realization of his theory, and to demonstrate how his poetic model is equally precise and flexible. Radovanović both realizes and recognizes his artistic output and theoretical thought as a united product as they were both created in his synthesic mind...|$|R
40|$|The {{leadership}} {{in many countries}} around the world has decided that within their education systems, a 'National Education' agenda should be promoted (Osler and Vincent, 2002). This appears to have a multiple agenda – it serves as a form of 'civics education' whereby the constitutional role of government is discussed and the sense of 'civic responsibility' promoted, but in fairly general terms. Other agendas seem to be to do with inculcating a sense of National Identity and a sense of 'citizenship' which has to do with pride in nation-state, commitment to the national cause, and developing a general sense of patriotism belonging (see Davidson, 1994) and national unity across within-border cultures. From time to time, this can degenerate into a level of flag waving that Billig (1996) has labled 'Banal Nationalism'. What most of these agendas seem to be built upon is an unproblematic notion of identity and the belief that there is either or can only be one identity even though the academic literature is replete with arguments against this tide (see Davidson, 1994; Dudley, Robison and Taylor, 1999). Hence contemporary research in sociology and social psychology seems to suggest that this is a flawed assumption. This is so because no matter how protective and paternalistic governments try to be, the power of globalisation to transcend national boundaries means that most citizens of most developed nations are global citizens and this especially applies to the younger members of communities who are adept in the uses of techno and cyber literacies which give them unparalleled access to other words (Luke and Luke, 2001). So not only are they subject to the vagaries of globalized finance markets and the degree of free trade making all types of consumer products available – what Habermas (1985) calls the colonization of the lifeworld, they are also subject to the globalizing effects of popular culture, which is easily available through large <b>multi-media</b> <b>transnational</b> companies. For the most part this popular culture is of western, mostly American origin. What this means then is that through the power of electronic media, most young people throughout the developed world are global citizens, and don’t think for one minute that the young people on this planet are duped into this … they invest, very heavily, in popular culture and no matter where they are embrace it wholeheartedly (Luke, 1997). This means that, as Luke (2002) has said, the master pedagogues are no longer teachers in schools but the likes of Disney, Nokia, Microsoft, CNN, MTV. The question facing Singapore is how can teachers and how can teacher education make National Education – the Singaporean versin of civics education relevant to young people in schools in what Giddens (2000) argues is an increasingly globalized world which is clearly populated by globalized identities...|$|R
