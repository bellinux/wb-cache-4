30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the older adultâs trip characteristics by comparing with other age groups both in urban and rural area. The research objects included trip frequency, trip length, destination distribution, and NHB trips. It should be noted <b>that</b> the <b>trip</b> in this paper was limited to automotive trip which did not consist of bus, walk, or any other transportation mode. A 2011 âs official survey [20] suggested <b>that</b> automotive <b>trip</b> accounted for about 67 Â % of all trips in the areas of this study. It could be further estimated <b>that</b> automotive <b>trip</b> occupied more than 83.75 Â % in the trips of this studyâs participants who were holding driving licenses and vehicles [20, 21]. According to some research [22], it can be inferred <b>that</b> the automotive <b>tripâs</b> rate in suburban/rural is even higher than that in urban area.|$|R
