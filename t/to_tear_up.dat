The woman lured Eugene out of the ring and Eugene went over and grabbed some cookies. As Eugene went to grab more cookies, Coachman slammed Eugene's head into the cookie tray. A spot in the match saw Garrison Cade come out to ringside with a stuffed animal, which prompted Cade <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>up</b> said toy animal.

Eugene Rock bottomed Coachman and pinned him for the win.|$|E
5|$|The {{corridor}} {{through which}} MT 287 passes {{was part of}} two migration routes along which settlers rushed to attempt to make their fortunes during the Alder Gulch gold rush that started in 1863. Virginia City {{was the target of}} both routes; the new town became the second capital of the Montana Territory in 1865. Settlers from the east followed the Bozeman Trail through Wyoming and eastern Montana, including the namesake city, and settlers from the south used the Virginia City branch of the Montana Trail from Utah and Idaho. After 10 years, the initial gold boom had ended, and the territorial capital moved to Helena in 1875. A second period of gold extraction came {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, when mechanical gold dredges arrived <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>up</b> Alder Gulch to gather more gold. Gold dredge placer mining and some lode mining formed the basis of the area's economy until the gold ore was mostly exhausted; the dredge tailings along Alder Gulch remain a visible reminder of the area's mining past.|$|E

5|$|Sebastian Vettel's {{momentum}} continued {{one week}} later in Korea, winning his third consecutive race and taking a six-point championship lead as Fernando Alonso finished third. Vettel overcame pole-sitter Mark Webber at the start, and was aided in building up a lead by first-lap contact between Jenson Button, Nico Rosberg and Kamui Kobayashi that saw Button and Rosberg retire with damage from the collision; Rosberg pulled over on the approach to the third turn, forcing a protracted yellow flag period as marshalls attempted to retrieve his car. With the sporting regulations banning overtaking while yellow flags were shown, the field was effectively thinned out in the opening laps as drivers were unable to pass one another. Tyre management {{became the focus of}} the race, as drivers reported heavy graining, particularly on the right-front tyre, which bore most of the load over a lap of the circuit. Vettel ignored six radio calls from his pit wall cautioning him that a tyre failure was imminent, only backing off just enough in the final few laps to secure victory over Webber by six seconds. The team later denied that there had ever been a problem with Vettel's tyres. Further down the order, Scuderia Toro Rosso's Jean-Éric Vergne and Daniel Ricciardo fought their way from sixteenth and twenty-first on the grid to finish eighth and ninth, while Romain Grosjean drove a conservative race to finish seventh, having been warned beforehand by the stewards that another first-lap altercation would likely result in his disqualification from the race. Lewis Hamilton's day went from bad to worse when an anti-roll bar on his McLaren failed, while the car handled its tyres so poorly that he was forced to make an unscheduled stop {{in order to make it}} to the finish, only <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>up</b> a length of astroturf that wreaked havoc on his downforce and he slid down to tenth place, narrowly fending off an opportunistic charge from Sergio Pérez to take the final World Championship point on offer. Button's retirement and Hamilton's single point meant that McLaren lost second place in the World Constructors' Championship to Ferrari, and Hamilton admitted that his bid to be the 2012 World Drivers' Champion was over.|$|E

25|$|The {{next decade}} brought the United States Football League (USFL), which played its {{season in the}} spring instead of autumn. After three seasons of play during which it never had {{the same number of}} teams and many franchises moved, it also filed an {{antitrust}} suit it had brought against the NFL. Seeking {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} and damages, USFL v. NFL centered around the NFL's television contracts, and in addition to the financial damages, it also sought to invalidate the league's contracts with at least one of the Big Three television networks that dominated U.S. TV at the time. The jury concluded that the NFL was indeed violating antitrust laws but refused <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>up</b> the broadcast contracts (noting that a last-ditch effort to move the league's season to autumn forced out numerous major market teams that would have made a television package more appealing) and only awarded a token $3 judgment in the USFL's favor. The failure to secure either objective in the lawsuit, coupled with mounting debts, prompted the USFL to cease operations.|$|E
25|$|The Days of Rage {{took place}} {{shortly after the}} June Convention, during {{the second week of}} October that fall. Taking place once again in Chicago, they were a {{consequence}} of the Weatherman faction seizing control of the student-run organization and convincing the group as a whole for the need of a full-fledged revolution. During the Days of Rage, “young radicals invested militant action with special power to enlighten, inspire, and mobilize”. This event “provided a way for them to establish the authenticity of their commitments, to assert their dissident or ‘revolutionary’ identities, and to live what they considered meaningful and engaged lives. The Weathermen had anticipated “at least 25,000 people” were to attend the Days of Rage; however, “instead of the promised 25,000 white youth ready <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>up</b> ‘pig city,’” a mere “700 to 800 people gathered” half of them spectators.

[...] Cobby appeared taken aback and would not accept the resignations. He spoke to seven of the pilots individually, but not Caldwell, as he was already under charge. When the men refused to withdraw the letters or elaborate on the reason for their actions, Cobby contacted his immediate superior, Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock, head of RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational command. Bostock arrived on Morotai the next day and interviewed the pilots, asking them <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>up</b> the letters, without success.

500|$|... 2001: A Space Odyssey is now {{considered}} one of the major artistic works of the 20th century, with many critics and filmmakers considering it Kubrick's masterpiece. Director Martin Scorsese has listed it as one of his favourite films of all time. In the 1980s, critic David Denby compared Kubrick to the monolith from 2001: A Space Odyssey, calling him [...] "a force of supernatural intelligence, appearing at great intervals amid high-pitched shrieks, who gives the world a violent kick up the next rung of the evolutionary ladder". Poet and critic Dan Schneider wrote that 2001: A Space Odyssey [...] "has one of the greatest screenplays ever penned", countering accusations of the film's coldness by saying, [...] "I recall the HAL ‘death scene’ {{as one of the few}} filmic moments to ever cause me <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>up</b> in sadness. [...] And, in the intervening years, I have, in film talks, found that the same scene caused the same emotional reaction in many other viewers. I was not alone.

Her list includes Nirvana's Dave Grohl, The Smashing Pumpkins' Jimmy Chamberlin, Hole's Patty Schemel, Pearl Jam and Soundgarden's Matt Cameron (he played in both bands), and Babes in Toyland's Lori Barbero.

Blake Madden praises Grohl's [...] "precise and powerful drumming" [...] and Modern Drummer Magazine states that Grohl's work with Nirvana was the [...] "...most impassioned and expertly crafted drumming" [...] in rock history. Bobbitt states that Jimmy Chamberlin had a [...] "jazz background", which infused his band's grunge sound with the [...] "lightness and versatility" [...] of Buddy Rich-style swing jazz drumming. [...] Bobbitt states that while Patty Schemel struggled with drugs and alcohol during her tenure in Courtney Love's musical groups from 1992 to 1998, Schemel turned [...] "clean and sober", enabling her to garner recognition for [...] "...her ability <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>up</b> the percussion" [...] kit; Bobbitt notes that Love hired Schemel based on Cobain's recommendation of Schemel's drum skills. Bobbitt states that Matt Cameron holds the distinction of playing drums in two major grunge bands: Pearl Jam and Soundgarden. She calls him [...] "grunge's [...] guru" [...] and praises his [...] "forceful" [...] playing and huge dynamic (loudness and softness) changes. As well, she notes that Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell stated that Cameron's playing was an important source of confidence for the band.
