About ten, the mate being on the poop, I stepped down on the main-deck for a moment. The carpenter's bench stood abaft the mainmast: I leaned against it sucking at my pipe, and the carpenter, a young chap, came to talk to me. He remarked, 'I think we have done very well, haven't we?' and then I perceived with annoyance the fool was trying to <b>tilt</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench.</b> I said curtly, 'Don't, Chips,' and immediately became aware of a queer sensation, of an absurd delusion,--I seemed somehow {{to be in the}} air.

Materials and Methods: The first two models consisted of a prosthesis supported by four implants, the distal two of which were tilted, with different cantilever lengths (5 mm and 15 mm). The third design consisted of a prosthesis supported by five conventionally placed implants and a 15 -mm cantilever. Results: In <b>the</b> <b>tilted</b> model with 5 -mm cantilever and in the nontilted model, the maximum value of compressive stress (- 18 Mpa) was found near the cervical area of the distal implant. Higher values for compressive stress were predicted near the cervical area of the distal implant in <b>the</b> <b>tilted</b> model with a 15 -mm cantilever, as compared to <b>the</b> <b>tilted</b> model with <b>the</b> 5 -mm cantilever. For <b>the</b> <b>tilted</b> model with <b>the</b> 5 -mm cantilever, peak values of tensile stress were predicted near the cervical area of both the distal (1. 25 Mpa) and the mesial implants (2. 5 Mpa). For the nontilted model, the peak value was found near the cervical area of the in-between implant (5 Mpa). For <b>the</b> <b>tilted</b> model with 15 -mm cantilever, tensile stress values were higher than in <b>the</b> <b>tilted</b> model with 5 -mm cantilever.
