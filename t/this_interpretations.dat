40|$|It {{is known}} that from the purely {{mathematical}} viewpoint, fuzzy sets {{can be interpreted as}} equivalent classes of random sets. <b>This</b> <b>interpretations</b> helps to teach fuzzy techniques to statisticians and also enables us to apply results about random sets to fuzzy techniques. The problem with this interpretation is that it is too complicated: a random set is not an easy notion, and classes of random sets are even more complex. This complexity goes against the spirit of fuzzy sets, whose purpose was to be simple and intuitively clear. From this viewpoint, it is desirable to simplify this interpretation. In this paper, we show that the random-set interpretation of fuzzy techniques can indeed be simplified: namely, we can show that fuzzy sets can be interpreted not as classes, but as strongly consistent random sets (in some reasonable sense). This is not yet at the desired level of simplicity, but this new interpretation is much simpler than the original one and thus, constitutes an important step towards the desired simplicity...|$|E

Mathematical and epistemological implications of the different interpretations will be discussed. Methodology: In a one semester Linear Algebra course polynomials were defined as functions but the coefficient-criterion for equivalence was assumed. Vectors were defined as elements of a Vector Space (systemic definition). After the course the students were interviewed about polynomials and their role as vectors. Findings: • Two of the above interpretations of polynomials {{were present in the}} students ’ responses: Expressions and functions. • Students evoked images that were never introduced in class, such as a curve for a polynomial, and a floating oriented segment for a vector. • Students experienced difficulties in consolidating their contradicting prototypes of vectors and polynomials. • The coefficient-criterion for polynomial-equality was rarely applied. • Only one student used the systemic definition of a vector.

40|$|Theoretical {{arguments}} nonwithstanding, it {{is possible}} to drive electron capture detectors with alternating current (a. c.). This study examines the basic features of such detectors, in particular their current and response profiles. It does so over a 10 - 106 Hz range of sinusoidal and rectangular a. c. polarization, and compares the results with corresponding data from conventional, unipolar regimes. In contrast to the authors 2 ̆ 7 own expectations, the a. c. driven detector is capable of collecting nearly all, and not just half, of the generated electrons on the counter- electrode. On the lower and higher frequency slopes of this curren level (called the 2 ̆ 2 plateau 2 ̆ 2) are situated two response maxima. According to speculations advanced in this study, the position of the former maximum is determined primarily by the cation-electron recombination rate, but the precise nature of its mechanism cannot be further defined without knowledge on recombination and neutralization rate constants. The position of the latter maximum is governed by the onset of electron oscillation, and its mechanism relies, predominantly if not exclusively, on a migrating negative space charge. A self-consistend interpretation is advanced for the various features of the current and response profiles, and experimental evidence is provided from corresponding unipolar pulsing regimes in support of <b>this</b> <b>interpretations.</b> Four 63 Ni detectors, two commercial and two lab-made, were used in this study. All four showed similar behaviour but, depending on their constrution, the relative sizes of the two response maxima (hence, speculatively, the relative contributions of the two response mechanisms) varied widely. The a. c. mode produced approximately the same calibrations curves and detection limits as optimized unipolar regimes, and there are reasons to expect that it might work particularly well with analytes that have relatively low electron-capture cross sections. It is also suggested that 2 ̆ 2 constant current 2 ̆ 2 operation should be possible in the a. c. mode. © 1987...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} aimed at {{shedding}} light {{on the question of}} the body, as it emerges from kant-ian practical reason, through a new spirit by which it is possible to look at the Kantian moral philosophy in a different way, in spite of the image that is always derived from the traditional interpretations. Starting from this aim, I have tried to provide a general ac-count concerning the studies of the interpreters – known as Kant-Renaissance – that follow similar lines from mid 1960 ‟s, focusing their attention especially on the Metaphysics of Morals. What comes out is an image of Kantian ethics that puts much less emphasis on the human noumenical nature and is instead more sensitive to the “material” aspect of the ethical life. From this reconsideration of Kantian ethics, agency of freedom and the con-struction of a personal identity take into account elements of the natural dimension of humanity, including what comes from body‟s needs, inclinations and desires, in a form that tends, somehow, to “naturalise” the practice of freedom much more than we would expect from just a first reading of the kantian moral philosophy. We have also, on the ba-sis of <b>this</b> <b>interpretations</b> – especially A. Wood‟s –, attempted to compare the spirit with which neuroethics tries to map what happens during the process in which “brain” makes a decision (establishing on this basis a sort of “pre-moral condition”) to either the aesthetic preliminaries of Metaphysics – in which Kant analyzes four moral predispositions to the exercise of freedom – or the three dispositions to the good contained in Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone. This comparison is an attempt to show how a strong normative theory of morality inspired by Kant, because of the unexpected compatibility with the spirit of neuroethics, could be capable, even today, of constituting a basis for that dimen-sion of moral agency which can not be reduced to a mapping of the human brain...|$|E
