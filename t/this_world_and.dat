5|$|Kiarostami's films often {{reflect upon}} {{immaterial}} {{concepts such as}} the soul and afterlife. At times, however, {{the very concept of}} the spiritual seems to be contradicted by the medium itself, given that it has no inherent means to confer the metaphysical. Some film theorists have argued that The Wind Will Carry Us provides a template by which a filmmaker can communicate metaphysical reality. The limits of the frame and the representation through dialogue with another that is not represented, physically become metaphors for the relationship between <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> those that may exist apart from it. By limiting the space of the mise en scène, Kiarostami expands the space of the art.|$|E
5|$|One {{common goal}} of early Daoism was to extend life by {{achieving}} immortality. The Celestial Masters believed {{that in order}} to achieve immortality, one was not supposed to extend life in the current world, but rather 'feign death' in <b>this</b> <b>world,</b> <b>and</b> be reborn on the other side. In order to feign death, an adept had to have perfectly harmonized internal spirits. When someone with refined internal spirits died in this world, their spirit would venture to the Palace of Grand Darkness where their form would be refined and then reborn in a perfected state on the other side. There are no surviving texts that describe what kind of place the 'other side' was. Those that failed to harmonize their internal spirits prior to death would be reborn in the underground earth-prisons, where they would be subject to eternal torment and toil.|$|E
25|$|Maya {{does not}} mean <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> its affairs. The {{illusion}} that <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> everything in it is real – and of feeling happy or unhappy over certain conditions – is Maya.|$|E

25|$|This widely quoted Mishna {{contains}} both {{a requirement}} {{to work and}} a warning against materialism.

25|$|According to Ibn Arabi, Islam is {{the best}} {{religion}} because of Muhammad. Ibn Arabi regards that the first entity that was brought into existence is the reality or essence of Muhammad (al-ḥaqīqa al-Muhammadiyya). Ibn Arabi regards Muhammad as the supreme human being and master of all creatures. Muhammad is therefore the primary role-model for human beings to aspire to emulate. Ibn Arabi believes that God's attributes and names are manifested in <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> that the most complete and perfect display of these divine attributes and names are seen in Muhammad. Ibn Arabi believes that one may see God in the mirror of Muhammad, meaning that the divine attributes of God are manifested through Muhammad. Ibn Arabi maintains that Muhammad {{is the best}} proof of God and by knowing Muhammad one knows God. Ibn Arabi also maintains that Muhammad is the master of all of humanity in both <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> the afterlife. In this view, Islam is the best religion, because Muhammad is Islam.|$|E

25|$|In Hellenistic and Roman times Tiresias' sex-change was {{embroidered}} {{upon and}} expanded into seven episodes, with appropriate amours in each, probably {{written by the}} Alexandrian Ptolemaeus Chennus, but attributed by Eustathius to Sostratus of Phanagoria's lost elegiac Tiresias. Tiresias {{is presented as a}} complexly liminal figure, mediating between humankind and the gods, male and female, blind and seeing, present and future, <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> the Underworld.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the last}} major battles {{involving}} Vikings was the Battle of Clontarf on 23 April 1014, in which Vikings fought both for the Irish over-king Brian Boru's army and for the Viking-led army opposing him. Irish and Viking literature depict the Battle of Clontarf as a gathering of <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> the supernatural, including witches, goblins and demons. A Viking poem portrays the environment as strongly pagan, with chanting Valkyries deciding who would live and who would die.|$|E
25|$|Caves {{are often}} {{described}} as entries into the watery Maya underworld. For Mesoamerican groups, including the Maya, life and death occur at liminal zones between <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> the otherworld. Caves then are both associated with life and death; when something emerges from the underworld, that something lives, and when something descends into the underworld, that something dies. Caves are seen as birthplaces where humans and group ancestors were born (and live) and the Maya of the Yucatán even thought that the sun and moon were born out of the underworld.|$|E
25|$|Oceans {{contain the}} {{greatest}} quantity of actively cycled carbon in <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> are {{second only to}} the lithosphere in the amount of carbon they store. The oceans' surface layer holds large amounts of dissolved inorganic carbon that is exchanged rapidly with the atmosphere. The deep layer's concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is about 15% higher than that of the surface layer. DIC is stored in the deep layer for much longer periods of time. Thermohaline circulation exchanges carbon between these two layers.|$|E

25|$|Rebbe Nachman {{told his}} disciples {{that as a}} small child, he eschewed the pleasures of <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> {{set his sights on}} spirituality. He paid his melamed (teacher) three extra coins for every page of Talmud that he taught him, beyond the fee that his father was paying the teacher, to {{encourage}} the teacher to cover more material. From the age of six, he would go out at night to pray at the grave of his great-grandfather, the Baal Shem Tov, and immerse in the mikveh afterward.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the concern}} of some Torah {{scholars}} that misunderstanding these passages as literal descriptions of God's image might lead to blasphemy or idolatry, there was great opposition to studying this topic without the proper initiation. Jewish biblical commentaries emphasize that the imagery of the merkabah {{is not meant to}} be taken literally; rather the chariot and its accompanying angels are analogies for the various ways that God reveals himself in this world. Hasidic philosophy and kabbalah discuss at length what each aspect of this vision represents in <b>this</b> <b>world,</b> <b>and</b> how the vision does not imply that God is made up of these forms.|$|E
