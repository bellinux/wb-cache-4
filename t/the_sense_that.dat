5|$|Bach {{performed}} the cantata again while Thomaskantor in Leipzig, notably {{at his first}} Easter there on 9 April 1724. He also performed it the following year on 1 April 1725, in his second cycle of Leipzig cantatas, a cycle of chorale cantatas based on Lutheran hymns. It followed in the cycle some forty newly composed cantatas. This early work fits the cycle in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> {{it is based on}} a chorale, but its style is different from the others.|$|E

Everton do not play early kick-offs on Sundays in order to permit Sunday services at the church. The church is synonymous with the football club and a wooden church structure was in place when Goodison Park was originally built. Former Everton players such as Brian Harris have had their funeral service held there.|$|E
50|$|Stretching from Kingsley to Martin Amis, Ladlit was comic in <b>the</b> {{traditional}} <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> {{it had a}} happy ending. It was romantic in <b>the</b> modern <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> it confronted men’s {{fear and}} final embrace of marriage and adult responsibilities. It was confessional in <b>the</b> postmodern <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> male protagonists and unreliable first-person narrators betrayed beneath their bravado {{the story of their}} insecurities, panic, cold sweats, performance anxieties and phobias. At {{the low end of the}} market, Ladlit was the masculine equivalent of the Bridget Jones Phenomenon; at the high end of the high street, it was a masterly examination of male identity in contemporary Britain".|$|R

5|$|I wish I could dissent {{from the}} general, though not universal, chorus of dispraise that has greeted this long-awaited and fairly long-delayed opera; but unless it has secrets to yield up – {{and one of}} the main reasons for feeling so dispirited as it went on was <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> one might be even more bored, if possible, during a {{subsequent}} hearing than during the first – the majority verdict is all too depressingly right.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, Frank {{was elected}} {{president}} of the Atlanta chapter of the B'nai B'rith, a Jewish fraternal organization. The Jewish community in Atlanta was the largest in the Southern United States, and the Franks belonged to a cultured and philanthropic social environment whose leisure pursuits included opera and bridge. Although the Southern United States was not specifically known for its antisemitism, Frank's northern culture and Jewish faith added to <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> he was different.|$|E

5|$|In {{many of the}} works, {{including}} the original series, Warhol drastically simplified the gold medallion that appears on Campbell's Soup cans by replacing the paired allegorical figures with a flat yellow disk. In most variations, the only hint of three-dimensionality came from the shading on the tin lid. Otherwise the image was flat. The works with torn labels are perceived as metaphors of life in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> even packaged food must meet its end. They are often described as expressionistic.|$|E

5|$|Maureen Ryan {{believed}} {{that one of}} the reasons the episode worked so well was because it left out the storylines with the Night's Watch and the Dothraki and focused in a single location.

Experimental results show that our model, with two unsupervised sense relatedness measures, compares well against two other prominent unsupervised word sense disambiguation methods. ...|$|R
