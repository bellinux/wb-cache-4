I'm no better nor a <b>tilted</b> <b>bottle,</b> I ar'n't,--I can't stop mysen when once I begin. But you look rarely, Miss; it does me good to see you.

50|$|The {{piece is}} often {{noted for its}} disjointed perspective. It has been {{described}} as a balanced composition due to its unbalanced parts; the <b>tilted</b> <b>bottle,</b> the incline of the basket, and the foreshortened lines of the cookies mesh with the lines of the tablecloth. Additionally, the right side of the tabletop is not in the same plane as the left side, as if the image simultaneously reflects two viewpoints.Paintings such as this helped form a bridge between Impressionism and Cubism.|$|E
50|$|Some of Landor's {{earliest}} {{designs were}} beer company logos that earned awards from the Brewers Association of America and the Small Brewers Association. For Arrowhead, Landor created a <b>tilt</b> <b>bottle</b> with two flat sides {{that could be}} poured without being lifted from the table. This unique design won several awards, drew media attention, and brought additional business to the firm. It was also selected by the U.S. Department of Commerce to appear in three International Trade Fairs.|$|R
60|$|Morganson <b>tilted</b> the <b>bottle</b> {{and filled}} the glass to the brim. He drank the liquor slowly, pleasuring in the fire of it that bit his tongue, sank hotly down his throat, and with warm, gentle caresses {{permeated}} his stomach.|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, Elkay {{launched}} the EZH2O Water Bottle Filler, which is recognized for contributing to keeping plastic bottles out of landfills. The unique counter {{on the unit}} allowed for users {{to see how many}} bottles had been saved from landfills at a particular location, which had the effect of “making the thing go viral”. The EZH2O first came about when Elkay business travelers started noticing their fellow travelers doing [...] "the airport dance." [...] More people were toting plastic water bottles. Rather than drinking from the fountain, they wanted to refill those jugs. It wasn't working. The dance was a sort of shuffle done by travelers trying to <b>tilt</b> <b>bottles</b> at the proper angle for refilling without splashing water on their shoes.|$|R
50|$|Spatial {{perception}} {{is defined as}} the ability to perceive spatial relationships in respect to the orientation of one's body despite distracting information. It consist of being able to perceive and visually understand outside spatial information such as features, properties, measurement, shapes, position and motion. For example, when one is navigating through a dense forest they are using spatial perception and awareness. Or another example is when trying to understand the relations and mechanics inside of a car, he or she is relying on their spatial perception to understand it's visual framework. Tests that measure spatial perception include the Rod and Frame test, where subjects must place a rod vertically while viewing a frame orientation of 22 degrees in angle, or the Water Level task, where subjects have to draw or identify a horizontal line in a <b>tilted</b> <b>bottle.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{experiment}} {{attempts to}} assess the subject's reasoning ability in spatial relations. To do so the subject is shown pictures depicting various shaped bottles with a water level marked, then shown pictures of the <b>bottles</b> <b>tilted</b> on different angles without the level marked, and the subject is asked to mark where the water level would be.|$|R
5000|$|Near San Diego, {{the source}} of the radio signals, {{communications}} officer Lieutenant Sunderstrom goes ashore in a radiation and oxygen suit. He has only one hour and will be alerted by a siren from the sub every 15 minutes. He discovers that the mysterious signal comes from a power station, {{but it is not a}} human survivor —- just a <b>tilted</b> Coca-Cola <b>bottle</b> hanging by its neck from an open window shade's pull cord; random ocean breezes bump the bottle against a [...] "live" [...] telegraph key to send the random signals. Sunderstrom stands the bottle upright and uses proper Morse Code to send a message describing the bleak situation. He returns to the sub before the hour is up.|$|R
50|$|In {{bringing}} the Rex Stout figment to life Arnold has contributed lots more than girth and {{a capacity for}} beer guzzling. His Nero Wolfe jells suavely with the imagination and makes a piquant example of personality conception. For seven years this corpulent sleuth, with a craving for nothing but good food and ease, has not ventured from his home. When he isn't unraveling a crime for the cash it will bring him, he gravitates between two hobbies, <b>bottle</b> <b>tilting</b> and orchid growing.|$|R
30|$|The {{rheological}} properties such as gelation time measurements were estimated by a visual bottle test method (Sydansk 1990). The bottle test method is a semiquantitative measurement of gelation time, {{and it can}} also be considered as a fast and inexpensive method to study the gelation kinetics over a wide range of chemical formulations (Dai et al. 2014; Yadav and Mahto 2012). The gelation time of water shutoff gel was considered the period of time when the gelling solution in a code A state turns to a flowing gel code C state (Bai et al. 2015). In this method, the gelation process was investigated at frequent time intervals by <b>tilting</b> the <b>bottles</b> to observe the gel flow behavior under the influence of gravity. The time required for the formation of flowing gel (Code C) was considered as gelation time. Each sample was measured three times to reduce the experimental error.|$|R
60|$|Of a sudden, he stopped, {{took the}} cork {{out of his}} bottle, and tossed it away. Light as it was, I heard it fall like a plummet. He {{swallowed}} slowly, <b>tilting</b> up the <b>bottle</b> by little and little, and now {{he looked at me}} no more. The last few drops of liquor he poured into the palm of his hand, and licked up. Then, with a sudden hurry of violence and swearing horribly, he threw the bottle from him, and stooped; and I saw in his hand a stone-hammer with a long heavy handle.|$|R
6000|$|Her admiration made {{no visible}} {{impression}} upon Cornelia, {{and for a}} moment she looked a little disappointed; then she took a basket from under the table, and drew from it a bottle of some yellowish liquid, an orange and a bit of sponge cake. [...] "Are you going to have yours here?" [...] she asked, as Cornelia opened a paper with the modest sandwich in it which she had made at breakfast, and fetched from her boarding-house. [...] "Oh, I'm so glad you haven't brought anything to drink with you! I felt almost sure you hadn't, and now you've got to share mine." [...] She took a cup from her basket, and in spite of Cornelia's protest that she never drank anything but water at dinner, she poured it full of tea for her. [...] "I'll drink out of the bottle," [...] she said. [...] "I like to. Some of the girls bring chocolate, but I think there's nothing like cold tea for the brain. Chocolate's so clogging; so's milk; but sometimes I bring that; it's glorious, drinking it out of the can." [...] She <b>tilted</b> the <b>bottle</b> to her lips, and half drained it at a draught. [...] "I always feel that I'm working with inspiration after I've had my cold tea. Of course they won't let you stay here long," [...] she added.|$|R
60|$|He drank again, {{and became}} more ferocious. I saw by his <b>tilting</b> of the <b>bottle</b> {{that there was}} no great {{quantity}} left in it. I distinctly understood that he was working himself up with its contents to make an end of me. I knew that every drop it held was a drop of my life. I knew that when I was changed into a part of the vapor that had crept towards me but a little while before, like my own warning ghost, he would do as he had done in my sister's case,--make all haste to the town, and be seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses. My rapid mind pursued him to the town, made a picture of the street with him in it, and contrasted its lights and life with the lonely marsh and the white vapor creeping over it, into which I should have dissolved.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{impression}} of food {{can be affected}} by “rendition”—i. e., the sur-rounding environment such as {{the appearance of the}} food and the dish—not just by its taste. We focused on the sound and vibration of liquid being poured from a Japanese Sake bottle as a haptic rendition of liquid. Sake bottles are known for their unique “glug ” sound and vibration which we believe affects the subjec-tive {{impression of}} the liquid in the bottle. To examine this idea, we propose a method that reproduces the vibration of pouring liquid from a Japanese Sake bottle by measuring and modeling real vibrations. We measured the vibration of water by <b>tilting</b> a Sake <b>bottle</b> at different angles, and created a model consisting of two decaying sinusoidal waves of different frequencies. To verify the appro-priateness of the model, we manufactured two types of devices and presented the modeled vibration characteristics...|$|R
6000|$|Presently he put {{his glass}} to his mouth, and of course found it empty. He looked puzzled, and glanced furtively and suspiciously {{out of the corner}} of his eye at a benignant and {{unconscious}} old lady who sat at his right. Shook his head, as much as to say, [...] "No, she couldn't have done it." [...] He <b>tilted</b> the corked <b>bottle</b> over his glass again, meantime searching around with his watery eye to see if anybody was watching him. He ate a few mouthfuls, raised his glass to his lips, and of course it was still empty. He bent an injured and accusing side-glance upon that unconscious old lady, which was a study to see. She went on eating and gave no sign. He took up his glass and his bottle, with a wise private nod of his head, and set them gravely on the left-hand side of his plate--poured himself another imaginary drink--went to work with his knife and fork once more--presently lifted his glass with good confidence, and found it empty, as usual.|$|R
5000|$|The new Plunderathon logo, {{released}} on their website in January 2008, states {{the elements of}} the logo are: A skull with mugs tilted away from the center, handles upward, in the place of eyesockets. Rum <b>bottles</b> <b>tilted</b> together take the place of nasal passages, crossed unadorned bones lie behind the skull. In a circle around the skull and crossed bones, from the lower left end of the cross to the lower right, is the text [...] "the Infernal Order of Pirates, Buccaneers, Scallywags, Privateers and Grocery Store Clerks." [...] Under the cross is the text [...] "Est. 1843" [...] for the year of the first Plunderathon. As long as these elements exist and nothing is added to it, the logo is used to identify those who have participated in Plunderathon. Pirates who have split from Plunderathon and gone out on their own omit the text [...] "the Infernal Order of Pirates, Buccaneers, Scallywags, Privateers and Grocery Store Clerks" [...] but retain [...] "Est. 1843" [...] out of respect for their roots.|$|R
6000|$|There were an aneroid {{and another}} {{box-shaped}} instrument {{hanging from the}} ring. The latter had an ivory plate bearing [...] "statoscope" [...] and other words in French, and a little indicator quivered and waggled, between Montee and Descente. [...] "That's all right," [...] said Bert. [...] "That tells if you're going up or down." [...] On the crimson padded seat of the balloon there lay a couple of rugs and a Kodak, and in opposite corners of {{the bottom of the}} car were an empty champagne bottle and a glass. [...] "Refreshments," [...] said Bert meditatively, <b>tilting</b> the empty <b>bottle.</b> Then he had a brilliant idea. The two padded bed-like seats, each with blankets and mattress, he perceived, were boxes, and within he found Mr. Butteridge's conception of an adequate equipment for a balloon ascent: a hamper which included a game pie, a Roman pie, a cold fowl, tomatoes, lettuce, ham sandwiches, shrimp sandwiches, a large cake, knives and forks and paper plates, self-heating tins of coffee and cocoa, bread, butter, and marmalade, several carefully packed bottles of champagne, bottles of Perrier water, and a big jar of water for washing, a portfolio, maps, and a compass, a rucksack containing a number of conveniences, including curling-tongs and hair-pins, a cap with ear-flaps, and so forth.|$|R
