5|$|This year, two {{separate}} teams {{were at work}} developing and <b>testing</b> <b>a</b> polio vaccine. Both projects came to disastrous ends. At New York University, Maurice Brodie, MD (1903–1939), a young researcher, prepared a killed poliovirus vaccine, testing it on chimpanzees, on himself, and finally on children. He enrolled about 11,000 individuals (in both control and vaccine groups) in his trial. Meanwhile, John Kolmer, MD, of Temple University in Philadelphia developed an attenuated poliovirus vaccine, which he tested in about 10,000 children. The tests proved a disaster. Several subjects died of polio, and many were paralyzed, made ill, or suffered allergic reactions to the vaccines.|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} {{of a group of}} twenty 6 -year-old children with specific language impairment (SLI) on several behavioural auditory tests was compared to that of a group of twenty age-matched control children. The auditory test battery used in this study consisted of the following tests: <b>a</b> speech-in-noise <b>test,</b> <b>a</b> filtered speech <b>test,</b> <b>a</b> binaural fusion <b>test,</b> <b>a</b> frequency pattern <b>test,</b> <b>a</b> duration pattern <b>test,</b> <b>a</b> temporal integration <b>test,</b> <b>an</b> auditory word discrimination <b>test,</b> <b>an</b> auditory synthesis <b>test,</b> <b>an</b> auditory closure <b>test</b> and <b>a</b> number recall <b>test.</b> Our results show that the SLI children obtained scores on almost all tests that were significantly lower than those of the control group. Many of the basic auditory processing measures in our test battery correlated significantly with receptive and language scores, suggesting a (causal) relationship between auditory processing and language proficiency. Results from discriminant function analyses do not warrant deleting one or more tests from the test battery yet (with the exception of the auditory synthesis test and the temporal integration test, for which we did not find significant group effects). At present, we are conducting experiments with older (SLI and control) children and adults to find whether the significant performance deficits of the SLI children are also found in older SLI children, and to determine the influence of maturational effects on these auditory tests...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: We {{evaluated}} {{pelvic floor}} muscle (PFM) behavior during Valsalva leak point pressure (VLPP) measurement in {{males and females}} affected by stress urinary incontinence and investigated whether VLPP results are influenced by PFM contraction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 25 females and 14 males underwent surface electromyographic (EMG) recording of PFM activity while performing VLPP. We investigated 2 conditions, VLPP during spontaneous strain (<b>test</b> <b>A),</b> and with simultaneous relaxation of the pelvic floor (test B). We analyzed average EMG activity (microV) at rest and during VLPP in <b>tests</b> <b>A</b> and B, the increasing EMG activity during <b>tests</b> <b>A</b> and B (the difference between average EMG activity during <b>tests</b> <b>A</b> and B and at rest), and the mean duration (seconds) of EMG activity during <b>tests</b> <b>A</b> and B. RESULTS: We detected {{a significant increase in}} EMG activity during <b>tests</b> <b>A</b> and B as compared to activity at rest (p < 0. 0001). Increasing EMG activity during test B was significantly reduced in females (p < 0. 05) but not in males. During <b>test</b> <b>A</b> patients reporting urinary incontinence showed a significantly lower EMG activity than that of continent patients (p < 0. 05). A significant reduction in maximum abdominal pressure was detected in test B compared to <b>test</b> <b>A,</b> but {{there was no difference in}} VLPP values between <b>tests</b> <b>A</b> and B. CONCLUSIONS: PFM activity significantly increases during VLPP measurement. Eliminating muscular contraction of the pelvic floor does not significantly alter VLPP results...|$|R

Laozi pretended to be a farmer when reaching the western gate, but was recognized by Yinxi, who asked to be taught by the great master. Laozi was not satisfied by simply being noticed by the guard and demanded an explanation. Yinxi expressed his deep desire to find the Tao and explained that his long study of astrology allowed him to recognize Laozi's approach. Yinxi was accepted by Laozi as a disciple.

5|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} <b>testing</b> <b>a</b> specific integrin, alpha-six-beta-one, and the role it plays in the RMS. The study researched the principle that chemoattractive molecules may {{play an important role}} in neuroblast migration in the RMS. The study of this one particular integrin was conducted in mice. By using antibodies to bind to α6β1 integrin subunits, found on the neuroblasts, the researchers observed that the migration was disrupted. Furthermore, they investigated the mechanism through which α6β1 integrin functions and determined it was via the chemoattractant laminin. This was completed by injecting laminin perpendicular to the RMS and observing that doing so drew “neuroblasts away from their normal course of migration”. The researchers concluded with the idea that this research could prove useful for therapeutics purposes in that neuroblasts could potentially be drawn to locations of injury or disease.|$|E
