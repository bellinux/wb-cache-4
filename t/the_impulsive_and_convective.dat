40|$|The non-stationary rocking {{response}} of liquid storage tanks under seismic base excitations including soil interaction {{has been developed}} based on the wavelet domain random vibration theory. The ground motion has been characterized through statistical functionals of wavelet coefficients of the ground acceleration history. The tank-liquid-foundation system is modelled as a multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) system with both lateral and rocking motions of vibration of the foundation. <b>The</b> <b>impulsive</b> <b>and</b> <b>convective</b> modes of vibration of the liquid in the tank have been considered. The wavelet domain coupled dynamic equations are formulated and then solved to get the expressions of instantaneous power spectral density function (PSDF) in terms of functionals of input wavelet coefficients. The moments of the instantaneous PSDF are used to obtain the stochastic responses of the tank {{in the form of}} coefficients of hydrodynamic pressure, base shear and overturning base moment for the largest expected peak responses. Parametric variations are carried out to study the effects of various governing parameters like height of liquid in the tank, height-radius ratio of the tank, ratio of total liquid mass to mass of foundation, and shear wave velocity in the soil medium, on the responses of the tank.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} {{comprehensive study of}} the dynamic response of storage tanks containing high-level radioactive wastes in nuclear facilities. Of the many issues that are peculiar to these systems, four important ones have been studied. Accordingly, the study is presented in four parts. The first part deals with the dynamic response of flexible tanks that are placed inside concrete vaults and {{are attached to the}} vaults both at the top and the bottom. The tanks are presumed to be fixed at the base and supported by either a roller or a hinge at the top. The response quantities examined include the natural frequencies of vibration, the hydrodynamic pressures and the induced tank forces. The general trends are established by comparing the response quantities for the top-constrained systems with those for base-excited cantilever systems. The second part deals with the response of rigid and flexible tanks containing stratified liquids. The liquid is considered to be arranged in layers with varying layer thicknesses and mass densities, or to be inhomogeneous with a continuously varying mass density. In addition to the free vibrational sloshing characteristics of the liquid, the responses examined include the vertical displacements at the free surface, and <b>the</b> <b>impulsive</b> <b>and</b> <b>convective</b> components of the hydrodynamic wall pressures and associated tank forces. A simplified analytical procedure that estimates the response quantities for the layered systems from corresponding solutions for homogeneous systems is also presented. The third part presents an exploratory study for assessing the effects of tank-base flexibility on the response of vertically excited liquid storage tanks. A suitable model of the tank-liquid-foundation-soil system is considered, and the natural frequencies, the associated damping ratios and the induced pressures are studied {{for a wide range of}} base-flexibility values. The final part estimates the effects induced by the impact of the sloshing liquid on the tank roof. Consideration is given not only to the effects that are induced on the roof but also to the effects that are transferred to the side-wall. Both rectangular and cylindrical systems are considered and the effect of changing the slope of the roof on the induced impact effects is also studied...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic fluid {{pressures}} {{developed during}} an earthquake are of {{importance in the}} design of structures such as dams, tanks and caissons. The first solution of such a problem was that by Westergaard (1933) who determined the pressures on a rectangular, vertical dam when it was subjected to horizontal acceleration. Jacobsen (1949) solved the corresponding problem for a cylindrical tank containing fluid and for a cylindrical pier surrounded by fluid. Werner and Sundquist (1949) extended Jacobsen's work to include a rectangular fluid container, a semicircular trough, a triangular trough and a hemisphere. Graham and Rodriguez (195 Z) gave a very complete analysis of <b>the</b> <b>impulsive</b> <b>and</b> <b>convective</b> pressures in a rectangular container. Hoskins and Jacobsen (1934) measured impulsive fluid pressures and Jacobsen and Ayre (1951) gave the results of similar measurements. Zangar (1953) presented the pressures on dam faces as measured on an electrical analog. The foregoing analyses were all carried out in the same fashion, which requires finding a solution of Laplace's equation that satisfies the boundary conditions. With these known solutions as checks on accuracy it is possible to derive solutions by an approximate method which avoids partial differential equations and series and presents solutions, for a number of cases in simple closed form. The approximate method appeals to physical intuition and makes it easy to see how the pressures arise. It thus seems to be particularly suitable for engineering applications. To introduce the method the problem of the rectangular tank is treated in some detail. Applications to other types of containers are treated more concisely. The essence of the method is the estimation of a simple type of flow which is similar to the actual fluid movement and this simple flow is used to determine the pressures. The method is analogous to the Rayleigh-Ritz method used in the theory of elasticity, and it always overestimates the forces. The method is capable of solving a wide variety of problems but if it is required that the solutions be in simple form, which they should to be practically useful, the number of problems that can be handled satisfactorily are limited, just {{as in the case of}} the Rayleigh-Ritz method.

40|$|The {{shaft support}} of {{elevated}} conical tanks should have adequate strength to resist axial loads, and moment and shear forces due to lateral loads. These forces {{depend on the}} total weight of the structure which varies {{with the amount of}} contents present in the tank container. In Sri Lanka, use of conical type water towers for storing in almost has been a practice in the country for a considerable period. All the structures, designed have been carried out for high winds. However, hardly any designs were carried with sufficiently serious attention given for earthquakes, since the location of the Sri Lanka was not considered as an earthquake prone area. Main objectives of the research are to investigate the structural adequacy of existing conical type water towers for earthquakes and development of relationship with seismic analysis for the tanks which have designed for wind loads. In order to achieve the above objectives, three different conical type water towers were selected which has capacities of 200 m 3, 300 m 3 and 750 m 3. These water towers were analyzed for 53. 5 m/s, 47 m/s, 38 m / s wind speeds which have been prescribed for post disaster structures for different zones in Sri Lanka. For earthquakes, dynamic analysis carried out for the same tanks using SAP 2000 - v l 4 for different soil types. Base shear and moments calculated using spring mass model. It has reveal that the existing structures which were designed for prescribed wind speeds were not adequate for resisting minor earthquakes. Also Impulsive mode of most of the water towers would have a natural period of vibration (T) are in the range of 0. 3 s to 0. 8 s which will give the highest response (base shear and moments) in an Earthquake. Since the response corresponding to the Natural period of vibration (T) of the conical type water towers is very high, it is not practical to give general recommendations or guidelines. Therefore, it is advised to carry out a dynamic analysis for the design of conical type water towers, so that necessary changes to the shaft diameter and thickness can be selected to resist the expected loads. Base shear and moment induce for 200 m 3 tank in 25 % and 50 % tank full condition is less than the tank empty condition, when analyze using spring mass model. However other large capacity tanks do not gives that kind of relationship. Therefore Detail investigating about <b>the</b> <b>impulsive</b> <b>and</b> <b>convective</b> modes for containers having internal obstructions and behavior with percentage filling of water could be recommended for future work...|$|E

(M&D) {{is under}} {{subcontract}} to Pacific Northwest National Laboratories (PNNL) to perform seismic {{analysis of the}} Hanford Site Double-Shell Tanks (DSTs) {{in support of a}} project entitled ''Double-Shell Tank (DSV Integrity Project-DST Thermal and Seismic Analyses) ''. The overall scope of the project is to complete an up-to-date comprehensive analysis of record of the DST System at Hanford in support of Tri-Party Agreement Milestone M- 48 - 14. The work described herein was performed in support of the seismic analysis of the DSTs. The thermal and operating loads analysis of the DSTs is documented in Rinker et al. (2004). The overall seismic analysis of the DSTs is being performed with the general-purpose finite element code ANSYS'. The global model used for the seismic analysis of the DSTs includes the DST structure, the contained waste, and the surrounding soil. The seismic analysis of the DSTs must address the fluid-structure interaction behavior and sloshing response of the primary tank and contained liquid. ANSYS has demonstrated capabilities for structural analysis, but has more limited capabilities for fluid-structure interaction analysis. The {{purpose of this study is}} to demonstrate the capabilities and investigate the limitations of the finite element code MSC. Dytranz for performing a dynamic fluid-structure interaction analysis of the primary tank and contained waste. To this end, the Dytran solutions are benchmarked against theoretical solutions appearing in BNL 1995, when such theoretical solutions exist. When theoretical solutions were not available, comparisons were made to theoretical solutions to similar problems, and to the results from ANSYS simulations. Both rigid tank and flexible tank configurations were analyzed with Dytran. The response parameters of interest that are evaluated in this study are the total hydrodynamic reaction forces, <b>the</b> <b>impulsive</b> <b>and</b> <b>convective</b> mode frequencies, the waste pressures, and slosh heights. To a limited extent, primary tank stresses are also reported. The capabilities and limitations of ANSYS for performing a fluid-structure interaction analysis of the primary tank and contained waste were explored in a parallel investigation and documented in a companion report (Carpenter and Abatt [2006]). The results of this study were used in conjunction with the results of the global ANSYS analysis reported in Carpenter et al. (2006) and the parallel ANSYS fluid-structure interaction analysis to help determine if a more refined sub-model of the primary tank is necessary to capture the important fluid-structure interaction effects in the tank and if so, how to best utilize a refined sub-model of the primary tank. The results of this study demonstrate that Dytran has the capability to perform fluid-structure interaction analysis of a primary tank subjected to seismic loading. With the exception of some isolated peak pressures and to a lesser extent peak stresses, the results agreed very well with theoretical solutions. The benchmarking study documented in Carpenter and Abatt (2006) showed that the ANSYS model used in that study captured much of the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) behavior, but did have limitations for predicting the convective response of the waste. While Dytran appears to have stronger capabilities for the analysis of the FSI behavior in the primary tank, it is more practical to use ANSYS for the global evaluation of the tank. Thus, Dytran served the purpose of helping to identify limitations in the ANSYS FSI analysis so that those limitations can be addressed in the structural evaluation of the primary tank...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{some special}} {{issues on the}} structural behaviour of upright-cylindrical liquid storage tanks, which are widely used in industrial facilities and for water storage. Two main design standards are considered: EN 1998 - 4, a relatively new standard, and Appendix E of API 650, which has been through substantial amendments and revisions in its new version (11 th edition, 2007). There are {{significant differences between the}} two specifications, which are due to the fact that there exist several controversial issues on this subject, open to further research. These issues are (a) the number of modes necessary to estimate ac-curately the convective seismic force due to the hydrodynamic behaviour of the liquid con-tainment; (b) the appropriate combination of <b>the</b> <b>impulsive</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>convective</b> component of seismic force; (c) the uplifting behaviour of unanchored tanks, with emphasis on the base plate behaviour and the increase of meridional compression; (d) the choice of an appropriate reduction (behaviour) factor for calculating both <b>the</b> <b>impulsive</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>convective</b> force; (e) the calculation of hydrodynamic hoop stresses due to liquid hydrodynamic motion; (f) the de-sign of tanks against buckling at the top due to liquid sloshing; (g) the importance of nonlin-ear wave sloshing effects. The present paper is aimed at addressing the above issues based mainly on numerical simulations. To simulate the tank shell and its structural behaviour, general-purpose finite element software ABAQUS is employed, whereas to examine hydrodynamic effects, an in-house numerical technique is developed. Existing data from previous investigations are also considered.

40|$|The exact {{solution}} to the dynamic response of circular cylindrical tanks containing two liquids, considering the gravitational (g) effect at the interface of the two liquids, is presented. Only rigid tanks were studied. The solution is expressed as the superposition of <b>the</b> so-called <b>impulsive</b> <b>and</b> <b>convective</b> solutions. <b>The</b> results are compared with those obtained by neglecting the gravitational effect at the interface to elucidate the g effect and {{with those of the}} tanks containing only one liquid to elucidate the effect of the interaction between two liquids. The response functions examined include the hydrodynamic pressure, base shear, base moments, sloshing motions at surface and at the interface of two liquids, and the associated sloshing frequencies. It is found that there are two natural frequencies associated with each sloshing mode in contrast to only one frequency associated with each sloshing mode if the g effect a-t the interface is neglected; also, the convective pressure has a discontinuity at the interface of two liquids, whereas <b>the</b> <b>impulsive</b> pressure is continuous at the interface. Further, it is shown that in a tank containing two liquids the maximum sloshing wave height may increase significantly, and the fundamental frequency of the sloshing motion is lower than that of an identical tank filled with only one liquid.

Emissions in the two episodes are regarded as <b>the</b> <b>impulsive</b> <b>and</b> gradual components, respectively. We compare the temporal, spatial, and spectral evolution of the two components in hard X-rays and microwaves. For this event, the most important finding is that both <b>the</b> <b>impulsive</b> <b>and</b> gradual hard X-rays at 50 keV are thick-target emissions at conjugate footpoints. Evolution of hard X-rays and microwaves during the gradual phase exhibits a separation motion between two footpoint sources, which reflects progressive magnetic reconnection.

40|$|Context. Bremsstrahlung hard X-rays {{emitted by}} {{electrons}} accelerated in solar flares {{are an important}} diagnostic for understanding the acceleration mechanism. Strong spectral variability is observed, usually following a soft-hard-soft pattern during impulsive emission spikes. In addition to this behavior, larger events occasionally show gradual hardening, usually in the late phase of the flares. Aims. We study quantitatively the hard X-ray spectral evolution of large solar flares featuring hardening trends. In particular, we investigate whether two different acceleration mechanisms are responsible for <b>the</b> <b>impulsive</b> <b>and</b> gradual phases. Methods. Spectral fitting of the non-thermal emission at high (âˆ¼ 4 s) and medium (âˆ¼ 32 s) cadence are obtained from RHESSI data, yielding time profiles of the non-thermal fit parameters (flux, spectral index, spectral curvature) for five X-class solar flares. The temporal evolution of the spectra is compared with the configuration and motion of the hard X-ray sources in RHESSI images. Results. Both soft-hard-soft (<b>impulsive)</b> phases <b>and</b> hardening (gradual) phases are observed during the events and are well described by piecewise linear dependence of the spectral index on the logarithm of the flux. The transition between <b>the</b> <b>impulsive</b> <b>and</b> gradual phases is smooth and progressive rather than abrupt, both in spectra and images. Comparison with a pure trapping model in the late phase leads to good agreement with the observation for the spectral index vs. flux relation, but poor predictions for the spectral curvature. Conclusions. The evidence we find points toward a single acceleration mechanism acting in the two phases, rather than two different separated mechanisms, because <b>the</b> <b>impulsive</b> <b>and</b> gradual phases are closely interconnected in time and space.
