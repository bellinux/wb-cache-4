500|$|Mackendrick {{assumed that}} Odets would need {{only two or}} three weeks to polish the script, but he took four months. The {{director}} recalled, [...] "We started shooting with no final script at all, while Clifford reconstructed the thing from stem to stern". The plot was largely intact, but in Mackendrick's biography he is quoted from Notes on Sweet Smell of Success: [...] "What Clifford did, in effect, was dismantle the structure of every single sequence in order to rebuild situations and relationships that were much more complex, had much greater tension and more dramatic energy". This process took time, and the start date for the production could not be delayed. Odets had to accompany the production to Manhattan and continued rewriting while they shot there. Returning to the city that had shunned him for going to Hollywood made Odets very neurotic and obsessed with all kinds of rituals as he worked at a furious pace, with pages often going straight from his typewriter to being shot the same day. Mackendrick said, [...] "So we cut the script <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> with the actors, just cutting down lines, making them more spare – what Clifford would have done himself, really, had there been time".|$|E
2500|$|Somewhat surprisingly, [...] "swing dance" [...] was not {{commonly}} used to identify a group of dances until {{the latter half of}} the 20th century. Historically, the term [...] "Swing" [...] referred to the style of jazz music, which inspired the evolution of the dance. Jitterbug is an umbrella term that denotes all forms of swing dance, though it is often used as a synonym for the six-count derivative of Lindy Hop called [...] "East Coast Swing". [...] It was also common to use the word to identify a kind of dancer (i.e., a swing dancer). [...] A [...] "jitterbug" [...] might prefer to dance Lindy Hop, Shag, or any of the other swing dances. [...] The term was famously associated with swing era band leader Cab Calloway because, as he put it, [...] " [...] look like a bunch of jitterbugs out <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> due to their fast, often bouncy movements." ...|$|E
60|$|There was {{the sound}} of a heavy thud, of a terrible scuffle <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> in the {{darkness}} and then a yell of victory from Collot d'Herbois.|$|E

60|$|Nothing <b>there</b> but vacancy! <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> lay a rusty {{sword and}} a rotten fan.|$|R
6000|$|... "But London, London's the place," [...] Terence continued. They looked {{together}} at the carpet, as though London itself were to be seen <b>there</b> lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> with all its spires and pinnacles pricking through the smoke.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I say, {{you were}} right about that noise. It was a shot. The poor little chap's down <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> {{with a hole in}} him the size of my fist.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>There,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of the bedroom, lay Dick Rover. There {{was a small}} cut on {{his left}} temple from which the blood was flowing. He was {{breathing}} heavily, and evidently trying to speak.|$|E
60|$|Leonard {{jumped up}} and ran to him, to find the dwarf on his feet and staring vacantly at the wall against which Soa had been sitting. She was gone, but <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> lay the ropes with which she had been tied.|$|E
6000|$|... "For <b>there,</b> gentlemen, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> {{just before}} <b>the</b> door, {{where the old}} man had seen the dog {{hesitate}} and lift his feet, there! there!--gentlemen--upon my honor, slowly widened and broadened a dark red pool of human blood! Stop him! Quick! Stop him, I say!" ...|$|R
60|$|I took {{a double}} turn around his elbows, and Darius {{ordered him to}} step into our canoe, which he did without hesitation, but once <b>there,</b> seated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flooring</b> of <b>the</b> boat with {{his back against the}} old man's knees, he glowered at us like an angry cat.|$|R
5000|$|Choreographer Michael Kidd {{originally}} {{turned down}} the film, recalling in 1997: [...] "Here are these slobs living off in the woods. They have no schooling, they are uncouth, <b>there's</b> manure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> <b>the</b> cows come in and out - and they're gonna get up and dance? We'd be laughed out of the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|There was {{yet another}} trouble. <b>There</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> where she had slipped down, lay Lady de Lannoy in a swoon. She called out instinctively, forgetting for the moment {{that the man was}} blind, but feeling all the old {{confidence}} which he had won in her heart: ...|$|E
60|$|Baxter was a Doctor Watson. What {{he wanted}} was a clew; {{but it is so}} hard for the novice to tell what is a clew and what is not. And then he {{happened}} to look down--and <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> was a clew that nobody could have overlooked.|$|E
60|$|He got his key {{and went}} upstairs, {{unlocking}} {{the door of}} a room at the rear. Everything was just as he had left it. <b>There</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> was still Ben Price's collar-button that had been torn from that eminent detective's shirt-band when they had overpowered Jimmy to arrest him.|$|E
50|$|The {{turning point}} in young Pinelli's journalistic career came with his daring live {{coverage}} of the fight between two rival gangs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> corner of Orfila Street. <b>There,</b> lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> he reported <b>the</b> bloodbath. After that, his place in Cuban Journalism was secured. This incident began his long and illustrious career.|$|R
6000|$|... "What a horrid place!" [...] {{she said}} faintly behind her handkerchief. [...] "Can't you {{take some of}} the paint away? I'm sure <b>there's</b> oil <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> How am I to get past that nasty table with <b>the</b> palette <b>on</b> it? Why can't you bring the picture down to the carriage, Frank?" ...|$|R
5|$|<b>There</b> {{was blood}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> I {{did not know}} if it was my brother or my husband's blood. My brother could not believe my husband was dead.|$|R
60|$|Never shall I {{forget the}} sight we saw or the smell we smelled when we burst into that kitchen. <b>There</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> was the McGinnis dog {{and what was}} left of Aunt Susanna's Thanksgiving turkey. As for the smell, imagine a commingled odor of {{scorching}} turnips and burning mince pies, and you have it.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's no use, Lou," [...] he {{said under}} his breath. [...] "You must despise {{me for being}} a drivelling fool, but I have neither eyes nor ears now. I would give all I have {{in the world to}} lie down <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> now before you and to kiss the soles of your feet." ...|$|E
60|$|But Dea Flavia, {{now that}} she was dressed, took no further notice of them; she left them <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> moaning and whimpering, and hurried out into the atrium. Here too the sense of terror filled the air. Beyond the colonnaded arcade in the {{corridors}} and the peristyle could be seen groups of slaves--men and women--squatting together with head meeting head in eager gossip, or clinging to one another in a state of abject cowardice.|$|E
60|$|Strained with {{weeks of}} trying to appear young and brisk in the store, Mother had become insensible before the gas could {{overcome}} him, and he awoke <b>there,</b> limp <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> before she revived. The room was still foul with gas-fumes, and very cold, for they had not rekindled the fire when they had returned after dinner.|$|R
5000|$|<b>There</b> {{was blood}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> I {{did not know}} if it was my brother or my husband's blood. My brother could not believe my husband was dead. —Jamila M'Barek ...|$|R
60|$|<b>There</b> was Kokua <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> <b>the</b> lamp at her side; {{before her}} was a milk-white bottle, with a round belly and a long neck; and as she viewed it, Kokua wrung her hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "Trouble {{enough about}} one man's {{life in a}} land where lives are cheap!" [...] exclaimed Wulf, {{thinking}} aloud, and {{at the sound of}} his voice all men started, as though it had thundered suddenly in a summer sky. Then with a laugh he tore the silk about his box asunder with his strong fingers, and breaking the seal, shook out its contents. Lo! <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> before him, gleaming green and white with emerald and diamond, lay the enchanted Star of Hassan.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was small}} and thin, like a girl's {{exercise}} book, with leaves {{that had once been}} blue and pink, but were now quite faded, and stained in places. On the fly leaf was written, in a very delicate hand, [...] "Emily Margaret Leith," [...] and the same writing covered the first few pages of the book. The rest were not written on at all. We sat <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> Diana and I, and read the little book together, while the rain thudded against the window panes.|$|E
6000|$|The bare {{suggestion}} {{was enough for}} Jack in his present hilarious humour. He instantly hiccuped, lapsed wildly over against Pete with artfully simulated alcoholic weakness, tumbled him on the floor, and grasping his white, woolly head, waved over it a boot-jack, and frantically demanded [...] "another bottle." [...] Then he laughed; as suddenly got up with the greatest gravity and a complete change in his demeanour, and wanted to know, severely, what he, Pete, meant by lying <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> {{in a state of}} beastly intoxication? ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{most popular}} art market in Paris was the gallery of the Palais-Royal, {{where more than}} fifty artists had their small studios and showrooms. The artists in the Gallery worked for a wide clientele; Parisians could have their {{portrait}} painted for thirty francs, or a profile for twelve francs. Many of the artists also had their residences <b>there,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fifth <b>floor.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Please do {{not become}} so excited, Professor," [...] responded Colonel Colby. [...] "We must try {{to get at the}} bottom of this matter. You say <b>there</b> is ice <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of your room?" ...|$|R
40|$|The {{clinic in}} Gi'ar {{in the inner}} Arabia. For {{a number of years}} Danmission had a Mission Station <b>there.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> ground <b>floor</b> to <b>the</b> right is a clinic for the woemen. To the left of the main {{entrance}} is the men's clinic, attended by one of the young Arabic men. He has received his education at the Scottish hospital Sheikh Othman.

6000|$|... "Well, you're out there, sir, as it happens, for he ate a {{remarkable}} big breakfast this morning. I don't know when I've known him {{make a better}} one, and he's ordered a good dish of cutlets for his lunch. I'm surprised myself, for since I came into that room yesterday and saw young Mr. Smith lying <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> I couldn't bear to look at food. Well, it takes all sorts to make a world, and the professor hasn't let it take his appetite away." ...|$|E
6000|$|Soon {{after he}} had gone a curious thing happened. The princess {{carelessly}} touched the wall of her room, which was wont to reflect the warm red light of the fire on the hearth, and found her hand quite wet. She turned round, and--was it her fancy? or did the fire burn more dimly than before? Hurriedly she passed into the picture gallery, where pools of water showed here and <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> and a cold chill ran through her whole body. At that instant her frightened ladies came running down the stairs, crying: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{just as well}} O'Sullivan wasn't here, sir," [...] he said. [...] "He'd a-drowned in {{the lower}} bunk. And I {{want to tell you}} I was doing some swimmin' before I could get into the top one. And salt water's bad for my sores. I oughtn't to be in a hole like this in Cape Horn weather. Look at the ice, <b>there,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> It's below freezin' right now in this room, and my {{blankets}} are wet, and I'm a sick man, as any man can tell that's got a nose." ...|$|E
60|$|Grandma {{looked in}} the basket for her handkerchief. It was not <b>there.</b> She looked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> seat and under the seat. It was not there. She stood up and shook herself--still no handkerchief.|$|R
60|$|Past {{the three}} cottages, whence {{a woman at}} a window stared in amaze to see that queer couple running, past the pond where the ducks, whiter than ever in the {{brightening}} sunlight, dived and circled carelessly, into <b>the</b> Tryst kitchen. <b>There</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> brick <b>floor</b> lay <b>the</b> distressful man, already struggling back out of epilepsy, while his little frightened son sat manfully beside him.|$|R
60|$|On I stumbled, I {{scarcely}} know how. Twice I fell, once I {{turned up}} the bisecting passage, but fortunately found out my mistake in time. For twenty minutes or more I crept along, till at last {{it occurred to me}} that I must have passed the little stair by which I had descended. So, utterly exhausted, and nearly frightened to death, I sank down at length <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stone <b>flooring,</b> and sank into oblivion.|$|R
