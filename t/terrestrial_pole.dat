5000|$|In {{the period}} from 1930 to 1933, working {{on the problem of}} {{numerical}} secular rotation pole movements. The Earth as a whole he considered as a fluid body, which in the case of short-duration forces behaves as a solid body, but under an influence behaves as an elastic body. Using vector analysis he made a mathematical model of the Earth which served him in creating a theory of secular motion of the terrestrial poles. He derived the equation of secular trajectory of a <b>terrestrial</b> <b>pole</b> and also the equation of pole motion along this trajectory. The equations further led to a determination of the 25 most characteristic points with pole trajectories for both hemispheres. This mathematical calculation led Milanković to 16 important points from the past that form parts of early explorations; 8 points triggered future explorations. He drew a map of the path of the poles over the past 300 million years and stated that changes happen in the interval of 5 million years (minimum) to 30 million years (maximum). He found that the secular pole trajectory depends only on the configuration of the terrestrial outer shell and the instantaneous pole position on it, more precisely on geometry of the Earth mass. On this basis he could calculate the secular pole trajectory. Also, based on Milanković’s model, the continental blocks sink into their underlying [...] "fluidal" [...] base, and slide around, ‘aiming to achieve’ isostatic equilibrium. In his conclusion about this problem, he wrote: For an extraterrestrial observer, the displacement of the pole take place {{in such a way that}} the ... Earth’s axis maintains its orientation in space, but the Earth’s crust is displaced on its substratum. Milankovitch published his paper on the subject entitled [...] "Numerical trajectory of secular changes of pole’s rotation" [...] in Belgrade in 1932.|$|E
40|$|Since August, 1969, ranges {{to one or}} more {{retroreflector}} arrays on {{the lunar}} surface have been measured by means of a laser procedure. Analysis of these measurements improves determination, not only of the orbit and librations of the moon, but also of the rotational parameters of the earth, including the X and Y coordinates of the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>pole,</b> and the true rotational angle of the earth with respect to atomic or to broadcast time. The considered approach for deriving the Universal Time 1 (UT 1) involves two steps. During the first step the parameters of the lunar orbit and librations are solved along with the coordinates of the retroreflectors on the moon and of the observatory. Improved values of the Universal Time 0 (UT 0) and range corrections at the observatory are obtained in the second step. Attention is given to lunar laser ranging (LLR), raw data in UT 1, an harmonic analysis of the LLR UT 1 data, and data obtained in 1980. The results provide UT 1 with an accuracy of a factor of 2 or more better than was previously available from conventional astrometric data...|$|E

These considerations have a special importance in our recent studies after the years 1990, concerning the relative motions of the real fluids in mobile trihedrons being in a rotational or translation motion with respect to a fix trihedron, with outstanding results in the theory of turbo machines, of ocean currents and magnetic <b>terrestrial</b> <b>poles,</b> pipe vibration, tire hydroplaning, wave propagation, etc...|$|R

40|$|Precise {{transformation}} {{between the}} celestial reference frames (CRF) and terrestrial reference frames (TRF) {{is needed for}} many purposes in Earth and space sciences. According to the Global Geodetic Observing System (GGOS) recommendations, the accuracy of positions and stability of reference frames should reach 1 mm and 0. 1 mm year− 1, and thus, the Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP) should be estimated with similar accuracy. Different realizations of TRFs, based on the combination of solutions from four different space geodetic techniques, and CRFs, based on a single technique only (VLBI, Very Long Baseline Interferometry), might cause a slow degradation of the consistency among EOP, CRFs, and TRFs (e. g., because of differences in geometry, orientation and scale) and a misalignment of the current conventional EOP series, IERS 08 C 04. We empirically assess the consistency among the conventional reference frames and EOP by analyzing the record of VLBI sessions since 1990 with varied settings to reflect the impact of changing frames or other processing strategies on the EOP estimates. Our tests show that the EOP estimates are insensitive to CRF changes, but sensitive to TRF variations and unmodeled geophysical signals at the GGOS level. The differences between the conventional IERS 08 C 04 and other EOP series computed with distinct TRF settings exhibit biases and even non-negligible trends in the cases where no differential rotations should appear, e. g., a drift of about 20 μas year− 1 in ypol when the VLBI-only frame VTRF 2008 is used. Likewise, different strategies on station position modeling originate scatters larger than 150 μas in the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>pole</b> coordinates.

40|$|This study briefly {{describes}} the targets {{and problems of}} the future Japanese project In situ Lunar Orientation Measurement (ILOM), which is planned for the year 2017. One of the important parts of the project is to place a small optical telescope on the Lunar surface with the purpose to detect the Lunar physical libration with unprecedented accuracy 0. 001 arcsec. At the present stage of research the computer simulation of future observations is going on, aiming to determine the moments of transition of a star through the first meridian and the polar distance of the star. Rotation of the Moon is being calculated under the analytical theory developed {{in the frame of}} a theme of the grant. A list of stars brighter than 12 m, whose coordinates are close to the Lunar precession pole motion, was constructed on the basis of several star catalogues. On average, for each moment of observation in the field of view of the telescope (1 A degrees) there are approximately 20 - 25 stars. Analyses of simulated stellar tracks observable from the Lunar surface (in a polar zone) reveal the significant difference from daily parallels of stars in comparison with the Earth. During one Lunar "day" equal 237 terrestrial days, a star moves on a spiral. However, depending on a longitude of a star, these spirals can be untwisted or twisted. In the latter case a star can describe a loop in the sky of the Moon during the period of supervision. Such an unusual astrometric phenomenon combined with the slow rotation of the Moon is compared with the Earth and the fast precession motion of the Lunar pole (in comparison with the precession motion of a <b>terrestrial</b> <b>pole)</b> ...|$|E

A brief history of the Small Explorer program is provided along {{with a description of}} the SAMPEX project development and structure. The spacecraft and scientific instrument configuration is presented. The orbit of SAMPEX has an altitude of 520 by 670 km and an 82 deg inclination. Maximum possible power is provided by articulated solar arrays that point continuously toward the sun. Highly sensitive science instruments point generally toward the local zenith, especially over the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>poles,</b> in order to measure optimally the galactic and solar cosmic ray flux. Energetic magnetospheric particle precipitation is monitored at lower geomagnetic latitudes. The spacecraft uses several innovative approaches including an optical fiber bus, powerful onboard computers, and large solid state memories (instead of tape recorders). Spacecraft communication and data acquisition are discussed, and the space- and ground-segment data flows are summarized. A mission lifetime of 3 years is sought with the goal of extending data acquisition over an even longer portion of the 11 -year solar activity cycle...|$|R
40|$|The {{unsupported}} circumnavigation of {{the lunar}} surface, either around the equator or over both poles is the longest distance expedition that can be implemented on the lunar surface. This mini-review describes some of the attributes of this expedition and reviews some of the dangers that the team will face. By travelling at just under 16 km/hr along the western terminator around the equator the 29 day, 11, 000 km, expedition can avoid darkness altogether and have 14 days of light to repair a vehicle should it break down. The minimum mean speed possible to avoid dark will be just over 10 km/hr. Periods of complete darkness, which will be encountered during the crossing {{of one of the}} poles during a polar circumnavigation (on account of the moon's small obliquity) or long-term breakdown during an equatorial circumnavigation, will impose challenges in navigation and vehicle manoeuvring not dissimilar to overwintering operations at the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>poles.</b> Pressurized lunar ball tents are described, together with some other field innovations for studies away from pressurized vehicles. The accomplishment of the first lunar circumnavigation will represent a significant milestone in Solar System expeditionary endeavour. Other lunar expeditions are listed...|$|R
5000|$|In {{his letter}} of 1269, Peregrinus {{explains}} {{how to identify}} the poles of the compasses. He also describes the laws of magnetic attraction and repulsion. The letters also contain a description of an experiment with a repaired magnet, {{as well as a}} number of compasses, one of which [...] "you will be able to direct your steps to cities and islands and to any place whatever in the world." [...] Indeed, the increasing perfection of magnetic compasses during the thirteenth century allowed navigators such as Vandino and Ugolino Vivaldi to strike out on voyages to unknown lands.The Epistola de magnete is divided into two parts. Part One (10 chapters): This is a section that serves as a model of inductive reasoning based on definite experiences, and setting forth the fundamental laws of magnetism. He did not discover these laws, but presented them in logical order. Part One discusses the physical (but not the occult) properties of the lodestone and provides the first extant written account of the polarity of magnets. He was thus the first to use the word “pole” in this context. He provides methods for determining the north and south poles of a magnet, and he describes the effects magnets have upon one another, showing that like poles repel each other and unlike poles attract each other. He also treats the attraction of iron by lodestones, the magnetization of iron by lodestones, and the ability to reverse the polarity in such an induced magnet. Peregrinus attributed the Earth's magnetism to the action of celestial poles, rather than to the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>poles</b> of the planet itself.|$|R
