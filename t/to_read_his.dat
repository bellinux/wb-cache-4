5|$|After he {{announced}} {{the building of}} the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly. In 1926, blood poisoning in his foot put him in a coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery, and three months of recuperation. In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced. Three days later Harvey married his long-time personal secretary May Leake. In 1930, he came down with double pneumonia. He was also going blind and needed younger people <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>his</b> letters and the newspaper to him.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, Nobel was {{astonished}} <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>his</b> own obituary, titled The merchant {{of death is}} dead, in a French newspaper. As it was Alfred's brother Ludvig who had died, the obituary was eight years premature. The article disconcerted Nobel and made him apprehensive about how he would be remembered. This inspired him to change his will. On 10 December 1896, Alfred Nobel died in his villa in San Remo, Italy, from a cerebral haemorrhage. He was 63 years old.|$|E

Liz confronts Tracy about the problem; he admits {{that he is}} illiterate and agrees to get help. Liz later notices Tracy reading a newspaper, and learns that he was using the ploy to get out of work. Liz tells Tracy that she is not going to take it anymore, and forces him to go through with the sketch.|$|E

25|$|Baruch {{became the}} scribe {{of the prophet}} Jeremiah and wrote down {{the first and second}} editions of his prophecies as they were {{dictated}} to him. Baruch remained true to the teachings and ideals of the great prophet, although like his master he was at times almost overwhelmed with despondency. While Jeremiah was in hiding to avoid the wrath of King Jehoakim, he commanded Baruch <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>his</b> prophecies of warning to the people gathered in the Temple in Jerusalem on a day of fasting. The task was both difficult and dangerous, but Baruch performed it without flinching and it was probably on this occasion that the prophet gave him the personal message.|$|E

25|$|Maddux {{established}} himself as the Cubs' ace in 1989, winning 19 games, including a September game at Montreal's Olympic Stadium that clinched the Cubs' second-ever National League Eastern Division championship. Manager Don Zimmer tabbed him to start Game One of the National League Championship Series against the San Francisco Giants. He allowed eight runs and was relieved after surrendering Will Clark's grand slam home run with two outs in the fourth. Maddux believed that just before the grand slam, Clark was able <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>his</b> lips during a conference at the mound between Maddux and Zimmer, and so knew what pitch to expect. After that incident, Maddux always covered his mouth with his glove during conversations on the mound. Maddux took a no-decision in Game Four; the Cubs ended up losing the NLCS four-games-to-one.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1880s {{the hunt}} for Geronimo was on and Bigelow was {{involved}} with the search, patrolling out of Fort Grant. Many patrols were carried out and the public's attention {{was drawn to the}} hunt. Harper's Weekly sent a young Frederic Remington out to document the historic events. While Remington went out with various cavalry troops of the 10th, he met a friend of an old friend in the dusty west. Bigelow's brother Poultney Bigelow was a former Yale classmate of Remington and had remained in contact with him. This started a friendship which would last for decades. Bigelow allowed Remington <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>his</b> journals and see his sketches. While Bigelow never became proficient in his sketches, his journals became the basis of serial articles on {{the hunt for}} Geronimo for his brother's Outing magazine. Remington added a series of freelance sketches for the magazine that included his new friend, John Bigelow.|$|E
25|$|In January 1899 {{he went to}} Siam {{and wrote}} {{that there was no}} need for French {{interference}} in that country, which was quite capable of governing itself. Later in the year he went to England, and early in 1900 paid a short visit to his relations in Australia. Returning to the east by way of Japan he then visited Korea before returning to Peking. The Boxer Uprising broke out soon after, and during the siege of the legations from June to August Morrison as an acting-lieutenant showed great courage, always ready to volunteer for every service of danger. He was superficially wounded in July but was erroneously reported as killed. He was afterwards able <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>his</b> highly laudatory obituary notice, which occupied two columns of The Times on 17 July 1900. After a siege of 55 days, the legations were relieved on 14 August 1900 by an army of various nationalities under General Alfred Gaselee. The army then ransacked much of the palaces in Peking, with Morrison taking part in the looting, making off with silks, furs, porcelain and bronzes.|$|E

25|$|The writer himself cited Cilibi Moise, a Wallachian Jewish peddler and aphorist, as {{an early}} influence, recalling how, as a child, he used <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>his</b> one-liner jokes, and treasured them as {{exceptional}} samples of concise humor. He was similarly impressed by the works of Moise's contemporary, the prolific author Anton Pann, whose accomplishments he praised during talks with his fellow Convorbiri Critice contributors, and whose work served {{as a source for}} at least one of his own stories. Nicolae Filimon, whom Caragiale praised on several occasions, was the author of short stories which several authors have identified as less accomplished versions of Rică Venturiano. A similar connection has been traced between the various sketches authored by Ion Heliade Rădulescu, in which Transylvanian writers are the object of ridicule, and Caragiale's character Marius Chicoş Rostogan. Caragiale's late admiration for Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu was also linked to affinities in comedic styles, as was his companionship with Iacob Negruzzi (himself the author of sarcastic pieces ridiculing the liberal politicians and lawyers).|$|E
25|$|The 1924–25 {{school year}} was a hard period of work for Bourguiba. However, {{he used to be}} {{interested}} in politics and French culture that he was eager to discover in every aspect. He frequently went to Palais Bourbon where he attended debates and sensitized to the intellectual and sentimental spirit of Leon Blum, that he already knew from Le Populaire. He also closely followed the evolution of French politics during the Third Republic. It was while discovering this new knowledge that he developed an interest for politics. Between classes, students went to Jardin du Luxembourg to talk about news and political issues, during the France between two wars. Bourguiba went <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>his</b> newspaper and participate in the debates. In that context of post-war, the main topics were Woodrow Wilson's self-determination doctrine and the Russian Revolution of 1917, but also the Congress of Tours that divided the SFIO. Furthermore, 1924 discussions were about Vladimir Lenin's death but also socialism and the rivalry between Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky. Bourguiba was following the international news in detail, was opposed to Bolsheviks and got interested in Gandhi's idea of transforming the National Indian Congress into a powerful mass organization. He also thought that Hô Chi Minh's participation in Tours Congress and his joining of the Communist International, aiming to get his country independence {{with the help of the}} enemies of Imperialism and Capitalism, made him dependent of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics (USSR). Bourguiba also admired his Tunisian fellow Mahmoud El Materi, who was active in Paris.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{begins with}} the name of José Palacios, who, here as with the {{historical}} figure of the same name, is Bolívar's [...] "long-serving mayordomo". As literary critic Seymour Menton observes, Palacios's [...] "total identification with Bolívar constitutes the novel's frame". Palacios constantly waits on the General, and at certain times he alone is allowed in the General's room. He has learned to live with his master's unpredictability and does not presume <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>his</b> thoughts. Simultaneously, however, [...] Palacios is also the General's closest confidante, the person best able <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>his</b> moods and share in his emotions. Born a slave, the character is six years younger than the General, and has spent his entire life in his service. Throughout the novel, Palacios provides the General with clarifications or reminders of dates and events during the General's time of disillusion. According to one critic, Palacios's ability to recall past events in Bolívar's life is essential for García Márquez's recreation of the character, as it allows the Bolívar of official history to be placed within the context of everyday life.|$|E
