Beppino Bitelli produced his first <b>three</b> <b>wheel</b> roller in 1933 {{although it was}} not until 1957 that the Bitelli Road Mechanics company was formed. <b>Tandem</b> <b>rollers</b> were soon added and In 1969 the first single drum rollers were manufactured. In 1978 Bitelli built its first paving machine and, during the 1980s, road profilers and soil stabilizers were added to the line of road machines.|$|R

50|$|Thomas Green also {{produced}} {{a range of}} steam road vehicles including fairground centre-engines, road tractors and agricultural tractors. Perhaps their most well known product in this range was the steamroller, which commenced in 1872 with a vertical boilered model for the Royal Gardens, Windsor. Shortly afterward, in 1880, a convertible model (i.e. traction engine or road roller) was introduced. A conventional horizontal boilered model followed this in 1881. The range was developed to encompass {{the whole range of}} weights (3 ton to 12 ton) and styles (<b>tandem</b> <b>roller,</b> triple roller) which enabled them {{to become one of the}} market leaders, with around 300 machines supplied.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Synchro drive uses chain {{sprocket}} mechanism to drive <b>three</b> <b>wheels</b> at vertex of triangular chaises and has limited load bearing capacities due to asymmetry. The driving and steering motors fixed {{near to the}} vertex of the triangular chassis and wear in chains {{over a period of}} time results in increased dead reckoning. The concept of simple pivot based mobile platform using two drives overcasts a conventional synchro drive omnidirectional mobile platform in many aspects. This mobile platform has symmetric chassis with six wheels that makes platform stable irrespective of any configuration. Gear trains to steer the four corner <b>wheels</b> in <b>tandem</b> with pivot <b>wheel</b> adds omnidirectional feature along with increased load bearing capacities and reduced dead reckoning. This paper highlights the concept of pivot steer based omnidirectional mobile platform. I...|$|R
