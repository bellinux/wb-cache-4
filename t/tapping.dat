40|$|The {{transporter}} proteins {{associated with}} antigen processing (<b>TAP</b> proteins) transport antigenic peptides across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane {{where they can}} assemble with newly synthesized major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I/beta 2 -microglobulin (beta 2 m) dimers. We have shown previously that <b>TAP</b> possesses a peptide-recognition site with broad specificity and that MHC class I/beta 2 m dimers physically associate with <b>TAP.</b> Here, we further characterize {{the nature of the}} peptide-binding site on <b>TAP,</b> and the site of interaction of <b>TAP</b> with MHC class I/beta 2 m dimers. <b>TAP</b> photoaffinity labeling experiments revealed that both <b>TAP</b> 1 and <b>TAP</b> 2 are photolabeled by two distinct photopeptide analogues, suggesting that elements of both <b>TAP</b> 1 and <b>TAP</b> 2 compose the peptide-recognition site. <b>TAP</b> photolabeling analysis on transfectant cell lines that express <b>TAP</b> 1 and <b>TAP</b> 2 both individually and together revealed that efficient formation of the peptide-binding site occurs only when <b>TAP</b> 1 and <b>TAP</b> 2 are coexpressed, which correlates with the finding that peptide translocation via <b>TAP</b> occurs only in the presence of both <b>TAP</b> 1 and <b>TAP</b> 2. These data strongly support the notion that <b>TAP</b> functions as a heterodimer. MHC class I/beta 2 m dimers were shown to associate with individual <b>TAP</b> 1 chains but were not detectable with individual <b>TAP</b> 2 chains.

40|$|The {{transporter}} {{associated with}} antigen processing (<b>TAP)</b> comprises two subunits, <b>TAP</b> 1 and <b>TAP</b> 2, each containing a hydrophobic membrane-spanning region (MSR) and a nucleotide binding domain (NBD). The <b>TAP</b> 1 /TAP 2 complex {{is required for}} peptide translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. To understand the role of each structural unit of the <b>TAP</b> 1 /TAP 2 complex, we generated two chimeras containing <b>TAP</b> 1 MSR and <b>TAP</b> 2 NBD (T 1 MT 2 C) or <b>TAP</b> 2 MSR and <b>TAP</b> 1 NBD (T 2 MT 1 C). We show that <b>TAP</b> 1 /T 2 MT 1 C, <b>TAP</b> 2 /T 1 MT 2 C, and T 1 MT 2 C/T 2 MT 1 C complexes bind peptide with an affinity comparable to wild-type complexes. By contrast, <b>TAP</b> 1 /T 1 MT 2 C and <b>TAP</b> 2 /T 2 MT 1 C complexes, although observed, are impaired for peptide binding. Thus, the MSRs of both <b>TAP</b> 1 and <b>TAP</b> 2 are required for binding peptide. However, neither NBD contains unique determinants required for peptide binding. The NBD-switched complexes, T 1 MT 2 C/T 2 MT 1 C, <b>TAP</b> 1 /T 2 MT 1 C, and <b>TAP</b> 2 /T 1 MT 2 C, all translocate peptides, but with progressively reduced efficiencies relative to the <b>TAP</b> 1 /TAP 2 complex. These results indicate that both nucleotide binding sites are catalytically active and support an alternating catalytic sites model for the <b>TAP</b> transport cycle, similar to that proposed for P-glycoprotein. The enhanced translocation efficiency of <b>TAP</b> 1 /T 2 MT 1 C relative to <b>TAP</b> 2 /T 1 MT 2 C complexes correlates with enhanced binding of the <b>TAP</b> 1 NBD-containing constructs to ATP-agarose beads. Preferential ATP interaction with <b>TAP</b> 1, if occurring in vivo, might polarize the transport cycle such that ATP binding to <b>TAP</b> 1 initiates the cycle. However, our observations that <b>TAP</b> complexes containing two identical <b>TAP</b> NBDs can mediate translocation indicate that distinct properties of the nucleotide binding site per se are not essential for the <b>TAP</b> catalytic cycle...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{transporter}} {{associated with}} antigen processing (<b>TAP)</b> is a heterodimeric {{member of the}} large family of ABC transporters. The study of interactions between the subunits <b>TAP</b> 1 and <b>TAP</b> 2 can reveal the relative orientation of the transmembrane segments, which form a translocation pore for peptides. This is essential for understanding the architecture of <b>TAP</b> and other ABC transporters. RESULTS: The amino-terminal six transmembrane segments (TMs) of human <b>TAP</b> 1, <b>TAP</b> 1 (1 - 6), and the amino-terminal five TMs of <b>TAP</b> 2, <b>TAP</b> 2 (1 - 5), are thought to constitute the pore of <b>TAP.</b> Two new approaches are used to define dimer interactions. We show that TM 6 of <b>TAP</b> 1 (1 - 6) is able to change topology post-translationally. This TM, along with a cytoplasmic tail, is translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, unless <b>TAP</b> 2 is expressed. Coexpression of TM(4 - 5) of <b>TAP</b> 2 stabilizes the topology of <b>TAP</b> 1 (1 - 6), even when the TM 1 of <b>TAP</b> 1 is subsitituted with another sequence. This suggests that the carboxy-terminal TMs of the pore-forming domains <b>TAP</b> 1 (1 - 6) and <b>TAP</b> 2 (1 - 5) interact. An alternative assay uses photobleaching in living cells using <b>TAP</b> 1 (1 - 6) tagged with the green fluorescent protein (GFP). Coexpression with <b>TAP</b> 2 (1 - 5) results in reduced movement of the heterodimer within the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, {{as compared with the}} single <b>TAP</b> 1 (1 - 6) molecule. In contrast, <b>TAP</b> 2 (1 - 4) has no effect on the mobility of <b>TAP</b> 1 (1 - 6) -GFP, indicating the importance of TM 5 of <b>TAP</b> 2 for dimer formation. Also, TM 1 of both <b>TAP</b> 1 and <b>TAP</b> 2 is essential for formation of a complex with low mobility. CONCLUSIONS: Dimerization of the pore-forming transmembrane domains of <b>TAP</b> 1 (TM 1 - 6) with its <b>TAP</b> 2 counterpart (TM 1 - 5) prevents the post-translational translocation of TM 6 of <b>TAP</b> 1 and results in a complex with reduced mobility within the endoplasmic reticulum membrane compared with the free subunit. These techniques are used to show that the pore-forming domains of <b>TAP</b> are aligned in a head-head/tail-tail orientation. This positions the following peptide-binding segments of the two <b>TAP</b> subunits {{to one side of the}} por...|$|R
40|$|The major {{histocompatibility}} complex-encoded transporter {{associated with}} antigen processing (<b>TAP)</b> {{is required for}} the efficient presentation of cytosolic antigens to class I-restricted T cells. <b>TAP</b> is thought to be formed by the interaction of two gene products, termed <b>TAP</b> 1 and <b>TAP</b> 2. We find that <b>TAPs</b> consisting either of human subunits, or mouse <b>TAP</b> 1 and human <b>TAP</b> 2, facilitate the presentation of numerous defined viral peptides to mouse class I-restricted T cells. As human and mouse <b>TAP</b> 2 and <b>TAP</b> 1 differ in 23 and 28 % of their residues, respectively, this indicates that <b>TAP</b> 1 and <b>TAP</b> 2 can form a functional complex with partners considerably different from those they coevolved with. Moreover, these findings indicate that widely disparate <b>TAPs</b> facilitate delivery of the same peptides to class I molecules. These findings suggest that <b>TAP</b> polymorphism does not greatly influence the types of peptides presented to the immune system...|$|R
