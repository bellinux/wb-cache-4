5|$|Then in August 2009, {{speculation}} mounted {{that the}} UK would drop the F-35B for the F-35C model, {{which would have}} meant the carriers being built to operate conventional <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> aircraft using the US-designed Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) catapults.|$|E
5|$|The {{elevator}} is {{also very}} narrow in chord like the rudder, and the B-52 suffers from limited elevator control authority. For long term pitch trim and airspeed changes the aircraft uses an all-moving tail with the elevator used for small adjustments within a stabilizer setting. The stabilizer is adjustable through 13 degrees of movement (nine up, four down) and is crucial to operations during <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> due to large pitch changes induced by flap application.|$|E
5|$|Wind shear {{refers to}} the {{variation}} of wind over either horizontal or vertical distances. Airplane pilots generally regard significant wind shear to be a horizontal change in airspeed of 30 knots (15m/s) for light aircraft, and near 45 knots (22m/s) for airliners at flight altitude. Vertical speed changes greater than 4.9knots (2.5m/s) also qualify as significant wind shear for aircraft. Low level wind shear can affect aircraft airspeed during <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> in disastrous ways, and airliner pilots are trained to avoid all microburst wind shear (headwind loss in excess of 30 knots). The rationale for this additional caution includes: (1) microburst intensity can double in a minute or less, (2) the winds can shift to excessive cross wind, (3) 40-50 knots is the threshold for survivability at some stages of low-altitude operations, and (4) several of the historical wind shear accidents involved 35-45 knot microbursts. Wind shear is also {{a key factor in}} the creation of severe thunderstorms. The additional hazard of turbulence is often associated with wind shear.|$|E

50|$|Aircraft {{can have}} {{different}} ways to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>land.</b> Conventional airplanes accelerate along the ground until sufficient lift is generated for takeoff, and reverse the process to land.

Some aircraft such as helicopters and Harrier Jump Jets can <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>land</b> vertically.

25|$|The {{installation}} of the 150hp (112kW) Royal Aircraft Factory 4a air-cooled V12 engine closely resembled that of the B.E.12, with the same large air scoop and similar vertically mounted exhausts protruding over the upper wing to carry the fumes clear of the crew.

25|$|As of 2007, several {{airlines}} {{are experimenting with}} base station and antenna systems installed on the airplane, allowing low power, short-range connection of any phones aboard to remain connected to the aircraft's base station. Thus, they would not attempt connection to the ground base stations as during <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing.</b> Simultaneously, airlines may offer phone services to their travelling passengers either as full voice and data services, or initially only as SMS text messaging and similar services. The Australian airline Qantas is the first airline to run a test aeroplane in this configuration {{in the autumn of}} 2007. Emirates has announced plans to allow limited mobile phone usage on some flights. However, in the past, commercial airlines have prevented the use of cell phones and laptops, due to the assertion that the frequencies emitted from these devices may disturb the radio waves contact of the airplane.|$|E
25|$|During {{the course}} of the conflict, the PAF enjoyed {{qualitative}} superiority over the IAF because most of the jets in IAF's fleet were of World War II-vintage. Despite this, the IAF was able to prevent the PAF from gaining air superiority over conflict zones. By the time the conflict had ended, Both sides claimed victory in the air war; Pakistan claimed to have destroyed 104 aircraft against its own losses of 19, while India claimed to have destroyed 73 enemy aircraft and lost 35 of its own. Despite the intense fighting, the conflict was effectively a stalemate. More than 60% of IAF's air combat losses took place during the disastrous battles over Kalaikunda and Pathankot. However, the IAF lost most of its aircraft on ground and the attrition rate (losses per 100 sorties) of the IAF stood at 1.49 while PAF's attrition rate was 2.16, because the IAF has larger number of aircraft with higher number of <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> sorties.|$|E

2500|$|Writing for The Daily Telegraph, {{reviewer}} Neil McCormick awarded The <b>Take</b> <b>Off</b> <b>and</b> <b>Landing</b> of Everything {{a maximum}} score of five stars, stating {{that it was}} [...] "fantastic: an album of world-beating standard yet still intimate and friendly, an epic of the everyday, a romance of the real." [...] Drowned in Sound's Aaron Lavery was similarly impressed, describing it as [...] "a record that's designed to be listened to as a whole, complete {{with a sense of}} mood and place that runs throughout", before concluding that it was [...] "an impressive feat indeed" [...] and scoring the album eight out of ten. In his review for The Guardian, music critic Alexis Petridis accorded the album a rating of four stars out of five, and noted that [...] "instead of pushing obvious buttons, The <b>Take</b> <b>Off</b> <b>and</b> <b>Landing</b> of Everything concentrates on what Elbow do best: Northern snug-philosopher wisdom...buoyed by music that's subtly expansive and adventurous".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1940s and early 1950s, the French {{aviation}} pioneer Louis Charles Breguet developed a concept for a Short <b>Take</b> <b>Off</b> <b>and</b> <b>Landing</b> (STOL) aircraft using four free-turbine turboshaft engines {{to drive a}} common powershaft, which, in turn drove four oversize propellers, which were evenly spaced along {{the leading edge of}} the wing with large, full-span, slotted flaps, with the arrangement known as [...] "l'aile soufflée" [...] or blown wing.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Take</b> <b>Off</b> <b>and</b> <b>Landing</b> of Everything has {{received}} acclaim from music critics.

2500|$|Bird strikes {{can damage}} vehicle components, or injure passengers. Flocks of birds are {{especially}} dangerous, {{and can lead}} to multiple strikes, and damage. Depending on the damage, aircraft at low altitudes or during <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> often cannot recover in time. [...] US Airways Flight 1549 {{is a classic example of}} this. [...] The engines on the Airbus A320 used on that flight were torn apart by multiple bird strikes at low altitude. [...] There was no time to make a safe landing at an airport, forcing a water landing in the Hudson River.|$|E

Pitchfork Media's Jason Heller, who scored The <b>Take</b> <b>Off</b> <b>and</b> <b>Landing</b> of Everything 6.2 out of 10.0, shared this view, stating that [...] "the album dangles there, an effortlessly leaden exhibition of glum triumphalism—and an example of what makes Elbow, at its least potent, so subtly unsubtle." ...|$|E
