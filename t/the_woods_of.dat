5|$|One of {{the first}} {{mentions}} of fishers in literature occurred in The Audubon Book of True Nature Stories. Robert Snyder relates a tale of his encounter with fishers in <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>of</b> the Adirondack Mountains of New York. He recounts three sightings, including one where he witnessed a fisher attacking a porcupine.|$|E
5|$|The day was hot, 87°F (31°C) by one account, and humid, and the Confederates {{suffered}} {{under the}} hot sun and from the Union counter-battery fire as they awaited the order to advance. When Union cannoneers overshot their targets, they often hit the massed infantry waiting in <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>of</b> Seminary Ridge or in the shallow depressions just behind Alexander's guns, causing significant casualties before the charge began.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically in 1904 by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck as Boletus rugosiceps. The type collection {{was made in}} <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>of</b> Port Jefferson, New York. Rolf Singer transferred it to Leccinum in 1945. Synonyms include Krombholzia rugosiceps, published by Rolf Singer in 1942, and Krombholziella rugosiceps, published by Josef Šutara in 1982. Krombholzia and Krombholziella are now obsolete genera that have since been subsumed into Leccinum.|$|E

5|$|With the {{conclusion}} of the fighting, however, military budgets were slashed, and even the forts that were designated for second- and first-class status were deemed surplus. The guns were removed, surplus equipment sold, and the land returned to its original owners. Fort Stanton itself was officially closed on March 20, 1866. Following the closure, the fort was abandoned to the elements, and <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>of</b> Anacostia rapidly reclaimed the land.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, the French {{government}} made an official investigation, concluding {{that it was}} possible that the aircraft had reached Newfoundland. In 1989, the NBC television series Unsolved Mysteries advanced the theory that the two aviators made it across the ocean, but crashed and perished in <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>of</b> Maine. One of Nungesser's relatives, William Nungesser, made several trips to Maine to search, focusing his energies around the north slope of Round Lake Hills in Washington County, Maine, as well as the area around Lake Winnipesaukee.|$|E
5|$|Moving west, {{the troop}} {{followed}} the division {{as it took}} positions in the Saar-Moselle Triangle, facing the Siegfried Switch Line on 7 January 1945, and shifted to the offensive on 14 January, seizing Tettingen and Butzdorf that day. The following day, the Nennigberg-Wies area was wrested from the German army, but heavy counterattacks followed and Butzdorf, Berg, and most of Nennig changed hands several times before being finally secured. On 20 January, an unsuccessful battalion attack against Orscholz, eastern terminus of the switch position, cost the division most of two companies. In early February, the division, with troop in tow, took <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>of</b> Campholz and later Sinz.|$|E

5|$|Stories {{were told}} of Boone making one last visit to Kentucky {{to pay off}} his creditors, {{although}} {{some or all of}} these tales may be folklore. American painter John James Audubon claimed to have gone hunting with Boone in <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>of</b> Kentucky around 1810. Years later, Audubon painted a portrait of Boone, supposedly from memory, although skeptics have noted the similarity of this painting to the well-known portraits by Chester Harding. Boone's family insisted he never returned to Kentucky after 1799, although some historians believe Boone visited his brother Squire near Kentucky in 1810 and have therefore reported Audubon's story as factual.|$|E
5|$|At night, a carnivorous, shape-shifting alien named Kator {{lands in}} <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>of</b> rural England. The vanguard of an {{invasion}} force, his {{mission is to}} evaluate the suitability of humans {{as a source of}} food for his species. Stumbling across Anderson and Sandy, a couple having a tryst in their parked car, he kills both and assumes the appearance of Anderson. The next morning, he encounters Jessica-Ann and Josephine, a lesbian couple who live in a nearby manor house. Although Jessica owns the property, having inherited it from her Canadian parents, the dominant of the pair is Jo, who is unusually possessive of Jessica and deeply suspicious of men. Simon, Jessica's boyfriend, has mysteriously disappeared. The women are vegetarians and live in seclusion with only a few chickens and a pet parrot, Wally, for company.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{began on}} 23 June as the English army {{attempted}} to force {{its way across}} the high ground of the Bannock Burn, which was surrounded by marshland. Skirmishing between the two sides broke out, resulting in the death of Sir Henry de Bohun, whom Robert killed in personal combat. Edward continued his advance the following day, and encountered the bulk of the Scottish army as they emerged from <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>of</b> New Park. Edward appears not to have expected the Scots to give battle here, and as a result had kept his forces in marching, rather than battle, order, with the archers − who would usually have been used to break up enemy spear formations − {{at the back of his}} army, rather than the front. His cavalry found it hard to operate in the cramped terrain and were crushed by Robert's spearmen. The English army was overwhelmed and its leaders were unable to regain control.|$|E

5|$|The town {{developed}} {{around its}} 11th-century priory, a Benedictine monastery, {{the remains of}} which make {{up some of the}} early parts of Great Malvern Priory, now a large parish church. Several slightly different histories explain the actual founding of the religious community. Legend tells that the settlement began following the murder of St. Werstan, a monk of Deerhurst, who fled from the Danes and took refuge in <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>of</b> Malvern, where the above-mentioned hermitage had been established. St Werstan's oratory is thought to have been located on the site of St Michael's Chapel which is believed to have stood on the site of Bello Sguardo, a Victorian Villa. Bello Sguardo was built on the site of Hermitage Cottage. The cottage was demolished in 1825 and ecclesiastical carvings were found within it. A Mediaeval undercroft, human bones and parts of a coffin were also uncovered. Although the legend may be monastic mythology, historians have however concluded that St. Werstan was the original martyr.|$|E
5|$|Ballaban's {{camp was}} {{located on the}} hills {{southwest}} of Krujë and {{at the bottom of}} the mountain nowadays known as Mt. Sarisalltëk, he placed a guarding force. The rest of his army surrounded Krujë. Skanderbeg and his allies marched through the mouth of the Mat River and cut through <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>of</b> Jonima to the boundaries of Krujë. Skanderbeg's commanders were assigned different groups for an assault on the main Ottoman camp: northern Albanian forces would be put under Dukagjini's command, Venetian battalions were under the command of Moneta, and Skanderbeg's most trusted forces would be assigned to another group under his command; Krujë's garrison would continue to defend the fortress. Moneta's and Dukagjini's men would attack the besieging forces from the north and Skanderbeg's men would attack from south of Krujë while also blocking any possible Ottoman reinforcements from the east. Skanderbeg first assaulted the guarding force which Ballaban had left and he gained control of this strategic point. Skanderbeg then managed to defeat the Ottoman relief forces under Ballaban's brother, Jonuz, and captured him and his son. Four days later, an organized attack from Skanderbeg and the forces from Krujë was carried during which Ballaban forces were retreated and he himself was killed in the resulting clashes by Gjergj Lleshi (Georgius Alexius).|$|E
5|$|Born into {{an aristocratic}} Prussian {{family with a}} long history of {{military}} service, Manstein joined the army at a young age and saw service on Western Front and Eastern Front during the First World War (1914–18). He rose to the rank of captain {{by the end of the}} war and was active in the inter-war period helping Germany rebuild her armed forces. In September 1939, during the invasion of Poland at the beginning of the Second World War, he was serving as Chief of Staff to Gerd von Rundstedt's Army Group South. Adolf Hitler chose Manstein's strategy for the invasion of France of May 1940, a plan later refined by Franz Halder and other members of the OKH. Anticipating a firm Allied reaction should the main thrust of the invasion take place through the Netherlands, Manstein devised an innovative operation—later known as the Sichelschnitt ("sickle cut")—that called for an attack through <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>of</b> the Ardennes and a rapid drive to the English Channel, thus cutting off the French and Allied armies in Belgium and Flanders. Attaining the rank of general at the end of the campaign, he was active in the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 and the Siege of Sevastopol (1941–1942), and was promoted to field marshal on 1 July 1942. He also participated in the Siege of Leningrad.|$|E

5|$|On the 21st, Napoleon {{received}} a dispatch from Davout that spoke of major engagements near Teugen-Hausen. Davout held his ground, and although Napoleon sent reinforcements, about 36,000 French troops {{had to face}} off against 75,000 Austrians. When Napoleon finally learned that Charles was not withdrawing to the east, he realigned the Grande Armée's axis in an operation that {{became known as the}} Landshut Maneuver. All available French forces, except 20,000 troops under Bessieres that were chasing Hiller, now hurled themselves against Eckmühl in another bid to trap the Austrians and relieve their beleaguered comrades. For 22 April, Charles left 40,000 troops under Rosenburg and Hohenzollern to attack Davout and Lefebvre while detaching two corps under Kollowrat and Lichtenstein to march for Abbach and gain undisputed control of the river bank. At 1:30pm, however, the sound of gunfire from the south could be heard—Napoleon had arrived. Davout immediately ordered an attack along the entire line despite numerical inferiority; the 10th Light Infantry Regiment successfully stormed the village of Leuchling and went on to capture <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>of</b> Unter-Leuchling with horrific casualties. Napoleon's reinforcements were soon crippling the Austrian left. The Battle of Eckmühl ended in a convincing French victory, and Charles decided to withdraw over the Danube towards Regensburg. Napoleon then launched Massena to capture Straubing to the east {{while the rest of the}} army pursued the escaping Austrians. The French managed to capture Regensburg after a heroic charge led by Marshal Lannes, but the vast majority of the Austrian army fled successfully to Bohemia. Napoleon then turned his attention south towards Vienna, fighting a series of actions against Hiller's forces, most famously, at the Battle of Ebersberg on 3 May. Ten days later, the Austrian capital fell for the second time in four years.|$|E
