5|$|For {{defining}} {{the geometry of}} a broach an internal <b>type</b> <b>is</b> shown below. Note that the geometries of other broaches are similar.|$|E
5|$|Stem– This <b>type</b> <b>is</b> {{grown for}} its seedstalk, {{rather than its}} leaves, and is used in Asian cooking, {{primarily}} Chinese, as well as stewed and creamed dishes.|$|E
5|$|The {{pollen grain}} <b>type</b> <b>is</b> compound, which means four microspores (pollen grains) are stuck {{together}} with a protein called callose.|$|E
5000|$|Var* {{variable}} <b>types</b> <b>are</b> deprecated in Visual Basic [...]NET. The common runtime decides which <b>types</b> <b>are</b> reference <b>types</b> {{and which}} <b>types</b> <b>are</b> value <b>types</b> so this <b>is</b> {{no longer the}} domain of the programmer.|$|R
50|$|Numerous {{desorber}} <b>types</b> <b>are</b> available today. Some of {{the more}} common <b>types</b> <b>are</b> listed below.|$|R
50|$|Duck <b>typing</b> <b>is</b> similar to, but {{distinct}} from structural <b>typing.</b> Structural <b>typing</b> <b>is</b> a static <b>typing</b> system that determines type compatibility and equivalence by a type's structure, whereas duck <b>typing</b> <b>is</b> dynamic and determines type compatibility by only {{that part of}} a <b>type's</b> structure that <b>is</b> accessed during run time.|$|R
5|$|The predominate rock <b>type</b> <b>is</b> a white, coarse-grained, foliated {{hornblende}} tonalite. Minerals in the tonalite are quartz, plagioclase, alkali feldspar and hornblende.|$|E
5|$|The trotter <b>type</b> <b>is</b> {{the lightest}} Finnhorse. A trotter section horse {{should be of}} light {{conformation}} yet muscular, with a relatively long body and long legs. At the studbook evaluation, a trotter-type horse must meet the standards in racing results and/or in breeding value index as decreed by Suomen Hippos. A trotter's disposition is evaluated during the drivability test. However, <b>type</b> <b>is</b> {{not part of the}} studbook evaluation standard for trotters.|$|E
5|$|Turunen's voice <b>type</b> <b>is</b> soprano. Over {{the course}} of her career, Turunen has {{developed}} a vocal range of three octaves.|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Navigation Pool No. 8 of the Upper Mississippi River has been investigated. Serological and pyocin <b>typing</b> <b>was</b> performed on 152 isolates, and serological <b>type</b> 1 <b>was</b> {{found to be}} the most prevalent (34. 2 %). Pyocin <b>typing</b> <b>was</b> {{found to be the}} most efficient method of differentiation, although serological <b>typing</b> <b>was</b> more practical...|$|R
50|$|Within each size <b>type</b> <b>are</b> two varieties: smooth (also {{referred}} to as smooth coat) and wire (also {{referred to}} as wire coat, wirehaired, longhaired or rough coat).All of these <b>types</b> <b>are</b> called 'Portuguese Podengo' as a 'breed,' although none of these six <b>types</b> <b>are</b> interbred.|$|R
5000|$|Various object <b>types</b> <b>are</b> {{commonly}} acknowledged: direct, indirect, and prepositional. These object <b>types</b> <b>are</b> {{illustrated in}} the following table: ...|$|R
5|$|A viral genome, {{irrespective}} of nucleic acid <b>type,</b> <b>is</b> almost always either single-stranded or double-stranded. Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, analogous to one-half of a ladder split down the middle. Double-stranded genomes consist of two complementary paired nucleic acids, analogous to a ladder. The virus particles of some virus families, {{such as those}} belonging to the Hepadnaviridae, contain a genome that is partially double-stranded and partially single-stranded.|$|E
5|$|Americans {{define the}} {{shoulder}} angle at alpha/2 ≈ 35 degrees. The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 1:228.6mm (1:9 in), 8 grooves, Ø lands = 5.53mm, Ø grooves = 5.62mm, land width = 1.63mm and the recommended primer <b>type</b> <b>is</b> small rifle.|$|E
5|$|Concorde also {{acquired}} an unusual nomenclature for an aircraft. In common usage in the United Kingdom, the <b>type</b> <b>is</b> known as Concorde without an article, {{rather than the}} Concorde or a Concorde.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} hard surface <b>types</b> <b>are</b> asphalt and concrete. The most common soft surface <b>types</b> <b>are</b> grass and gravel.|$|R
50|$|The <b>type</b> system <b>is</b> static unless {{annotations}} for dynamic <b>typing</b> <b>are</b> present, for {{use with}} targets that support them. Type checking follows nominal typing {{with the exception of}} anonymous types where structural <b>typing</b> <b>is</b> used instead. Finally, <b>type</b> inference <b>is</b> supported, allowing for variable declarations without type annotations.|$|R
50|$|<b>Types</b> {{that can}} <b>be</b> {{instantiated}} automatically by the <b>type</b> system <b>are</b> called instantiable. An important characteristic of these <b>types</b> <b>is</b> {{that the first}} bytes of any instance always contain a pointer to the class structure (a form of virtual table) associated {{to the type of}} the instance. For this reason, any instantiable <b>type</b> must <b>be</b> classed. Contrapositively, any non-classed type (such as integer or string) must be non-instantiable. On the other hand, most classed <b>types</b> <b>are</b> instantiable, but some, such as interface <b>types,</b> <b>are</b> not.|$|R
5|$|Diverse flora {{exists on}} Mount Bailey. Starting {{at the lower}} slopes, the {{prominent}} tree <b>type</b> <b>is</b> standard pine, eventually changing to a landscape of mountain hemlock, western white pine, and Shasta fir.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, hot {{chocolate}} remains a popular national drink, often including semi-sweet chocolate, cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla. Hot chocolate of this <b>type</b> <b>is</b> commonly sold in circular or hexagonal tablets {{which can be}} dissolved into hot milk, water, or cream, and then blended until the mixture develops a creamy froth. A 1942 article in the Chicago Tribune describes Mexican cinnamon {{hot chocolate}} as being traditionally served alongside a variety of sweet Mexican pastries, such as pan dulce or churros.|$|E
5|$|In North American and European populations, around 4–8% {{of people}} have a thrombophilia, most {{commonly}} factor V leiden and prothrombin G20210A. For populations in China, Japan, and Thailand, deficiences in protein S, protein C, and antithrombin predominate. Non-O blood <b>type</b> <b>is</b> present in around 50% {{of the general population}} and varies with ethnicity, and it is present in about 70% of those with VTE. Altogether, global data is incomplete.|$|E
50|$|Four major {{antibody}} <b>types</b> <b>were</b> developed: murine, chimeric, humanised and human. Antibodies of each <b>type</b> <b>are</b> {{distinguished by}} suffixes on their name.|$|R
5000|$|Fifth edition's {{approach}} to creature <b>types</b> <b>is</b> similar to third edition's. The outsider <b>type</b> has <b>been</b> split into celestials and fiends, animal and vermin <b>type</b> have <b>been</b> combined into beast type, and several <b>types</b> have <b>been</b> removed (magical beast, monstrous humanoid, etc.) and the catch-all monstrosity <b>type</b> has <b>been</b> added.|$|R
50|$|Type-indexed <b>types</b> <b>are</b> <b>types</b> that <b>are</b> indexed {{over the}} type constructors. These {{can be used}} to give types to more {{involved}} generic values. The resulting type-indexed <b>types</b> can <b>be</b> specialised to any type.|$|R
5|$|Israel {{had shown}} {{interest}} in the V-22. In 2009, Israel reportedly favored the Sikorsky CH-53K over the V-22. In 2011, Israel was interested in using the V-22 to support special operations and search and rescue missions. In 2013, Israel was interested in a possible lease of six to eight aircraft for special operations missions; the <b>type</b> <b>is</b> not {{to act as a}} replacement for existing rotorcraft.|$|E
5|$|Mammals {{include the}} biggest animals on the planet, the great whales. The basic body <b>type</b> <b>is</b> a {{terrestrial}} quadruped, but some mammals are adapted for life at sea, in the air, in trees, underground or on two legs. The {{largest group of}} mammals, the placentals, have a placenta, which enables the feeding of the fetus during gestation.|$|E
5|$|Oilseed– This <b>type</b> <b>is</b> {{grown for}} its seeds, which are pressed to extract an oil mainly used for cooking. It has few leaves, bolts quickly and {{produces}} seeds around 50 percent larger than {{other types of}} lettuce.|$|E
50|$|Seven {{locomotives}} of the <b>type</b> <b>were</b> built which performed adequately, {{but also}} displayed disadvantages over a 4-4-0 {{and so the}} <b>type</b> <b>was</b> not perpetuated.|$|R
50|$|Commercial {{aircraft}} include types {{designed for}} scheduled and charter airline flights, carrying passengers, mail and other cargo. The larger passenger-carrying <b>types</b> <b>are</b> the airliners, {{the largest of}} which are wide-body aircraft. Some of the smaller <b>types</b> <b>are</b> also used in general aviation, {{and some of the}} larger <b>types</b> <b>are</b> used as VIP aircraft.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{propose a}} modest {{conservative}} extension to ML that allows semi-explicit first-class polymorphism while preserving the essential properties of type inference. In our proposal, {{the introduction of}} polymorphic <b>types</b> <b>is</b> fully explicit, that is, both introduction points and exact polymorphic <b>types</b> <b>are</b> to be specified. However, the elimination of polymorphic <b>types</b> <b>is</b> semi-implicit: only elimination points are to be specified as polymorphic <b>types</b> themselves <b>are</b> inferred. This extension is particularly useful in objective ML where polymorphism replaces subtyping...|$|R
5|$|One {{circumstance}} {{which may}} call for issuance {{of a second}} passport of a particular <b>type</b> <b>is</b> a prolonged visa-processing delay especially for Angola and São Tomé and Príncipe visa applications. Another is safety or security. The period of validity of a second passport issued under either circumstance is generally two years from the date of issue.|$|E
5|$|The Amylostereaceae {{possess a}} dimitic trama, meaning {{that there are}} in its mycelia two kinds of hyphae. The first <b>type</b> <b>is</b> {{brownish}} skeletal hyphae, which provide stability to the fruit body. These hyphae run parallel to the bark and often have hairpin-like turns, so that the loops form thick-walled, cystidium-like structures, the so-called pseudocystidia. The second <b>type</b> <b>is</b> generative hyphae. They are translucent (hyaline) and serve to promote {{the growth of the}} fungus. Genuine cystidia arise in the hymenium and the layer directly below, the subhymenium. Both pseudocystidia and cystidia are encrusted, meaning that they feature crystal-like structures on the top.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56 also {{supports}} pivoting-door type thrust reversers. This <b>type</b> <b>is</b> {{used on the}} CFM56-5 engines that power many Airbus aircraft. They work by actuating a door that pivots down into the bypass duct, both blocking the bypass air and deflecting the flow outward, creating the reverse thrust.|$|E
5000|$|Suppose the {{typewriter}} has 50 keys, {{and the word}} to <b>be</b> <b>typed</b> <b>is</b> banana. If the keys are pressed randomly and independently, it means that each key has an equal chance of being pressed. Then, the chance that the first letter <b>typed</b> <b>is</b> 'b' is 1/50, and the chance that the second letter <b>typed</b> <b>is</b> a is also 1/50, and so on. Therefore, the chance of the first six letters spelling banana is ...|$|R
