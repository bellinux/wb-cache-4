5|$|In 1148, Pope Eugene III {{granted the}} abbey an {{exemption}} on paying tithe for their newly acquired land and livestock. This was granted {{on the condition}} that there was to be no impropriety or violence when electing an abbot, and <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> donated money to the abbey could be buried within it, regardless of whether they had been excommunicated.|$|E
5|$|Around 300men from Cheadle Hulme {{served in}} the First World War, and it was decided <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> died should be commemorated. Various ideas, {{including}} a library and clock tower, were suggested {{and in the end}} a cenotaph was built on the corner of Ravenoak Road and Manor Road in 1921. Additions for later wars have been made, and due to the busy traffic around that particular place there have been suggestions for moving it to a quieter area.|$|E
5|$|Duckles {{observes that}} by 1651, the {{transition}} from the lute song to the continuo song was complete. Printed versions of songs can not be entirely trusted to represent what was sung, since, in order to keep engraving costs manageable, they would economize on written vocal embellishments. That's why manuscript sources are crucial to our understanding of transition to Baroque vocal styles. Duckles concludes by warning <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> study early 17th century lyric poetry must do so in conjunction with their intended musical settings, since words and music are inseparable.|$|E

5|$|Fairman {{discusses}} {{the efforts of}} conservatives in the United States to censor the word from common parlance in the country, and says these acts {{are opposed to the}} First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Fairman warns against a tendency toward self-censorship. He explains <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> choose to silence themselves tacitly encourage a process by which speech is forbidden through the legal process. He argues that this passivity has an impact of increasing the taboo nature of the word.|$|E
5|$|Hand's civil {{instincts}} were at {{odds with}} the duty of a judge to stay aloof from politics. As a judge he respected even bad laws; as a member of society he felt free to question the decisions behind legislation. In his opinion, members of a democratic society should be involved in legislative decision-making. He therefore regarded toleration as a prerequisite of civil liberty. In practice, this even meant <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> wish to promote ideas repugnant to the majority should be free to do so, within broad limits.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{attachment}} theory {{had significant}} policy implications for hospitalized or institutionalized children, {{and those in}} poor quality daycare. Controversy remains over whether non-maternal care, particularly in group settings, has deleterious effects on social development. It is plain from research that poor quality care carries risks but <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> experience good quality alternative care cope well although {{it is difficult to}} provide good quality, individualized care in group settings.|$|E

5000|$|A {{fragment}} {{from the}} early 2nd century {{of one of the}} lost volumes of Papias, a Christian bishop, expounds that [...] "heaven" [...] was separated into three distinct layers. He referred to the first as just [...] "heaven", the second as [...] "paradise", and the third as [...] "the city". Papias taught that [...] "there is this distinction between the habitation of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> produce a hundredfold, and <b>that</b> of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> produce sixty-fold, and <b>that</b> of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> produce thirty-fold".|$|R

5|$|In 1971, the IOC, at its Amsterdam session, {{voted to}} strip the South African NOC of recognition. Although Brundage had hoped to keep South Africa within the Olympic movement, he {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> sought its expulsion had made the stronger case. South Africa {{did not return to}} the Olympics until the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, after the end of its apartheid government.|$|E
5|$|In {{the medieval}} and renaissance tradition, Troilus {{is one of}} those who argue most for war against the Greeks in Priam's council. In several texts, for example the Laud Troy Book, he says <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> {{disagree}} with him are better suited to be priests. Guido, and writers who follow him, have Hector, knowing how headstrong his brother can be, counsel Troilus not to be reckless before the first battle.|$|E
5|$|Munir Sheikh, Canada's Chief Statistician {{appointed}} on Harper's advice, resigned on July 21, 2010, {{in protest}} of the government's change in policy. Ivan Fellegi, the former Chief Statistician of Canada, criticized the government's decision, saying <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> are most vulnerable (such as the poor, new immigrants, and aboriginals) are least likely {{to respond to a}} voluntary form, which weakens information about their demographic.|$|E

5|$|On 21 January, Bader {{dramatically}} altered {{his previous}} orders regarding {{the treatment of}} those encountered {{in the area of}} operations, directing <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> did not resist and surrendered or merely had weapons in their houses, were to be treated as prisoners of war. It is likely that this change was intended to assist Chetniks in the area of operations to avoid destruction. By the end of January, Bader's chief of staff was attempting to negotiate a cooperation agreement with Dangić, and in turn Dangić ordered the 4,500–10,000 Chetniks under his command to avoid the Germans or surrender their weapons immediately if they were unable to do so.|$|E
5|$|Politically, {{however, the}} battle is {{considered}} a failure for France. Initially, France had desired a revolt against the governor of Salé to force repayment and avoid destruction of the city, but this did not occur. The French demanded <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> killed Christians in the city be sentenced to death, and that thieves have their hands cut off; however, the governor of Salé simply banished these people from the city.|$|E
5|$|Some lessons {{identified}} in the series include diversity, acceptance, political tolerance, and equality. Surveys of over 1,000 college students in the United States show <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> read the books were significantly different {{than those who had}} not. Readers of the series were found to be more tolerant, more opposed to violence and torture, less authoritarian, and less cynical. Although it is not known if this is a cause-and-effect relationship, there is a clear correlation, and it seems that Harry Potter's cultural impact may be stronger than just a fandom bond.|$|E

5|$|The DAP also {{focused on}} landholding issues. Chong Chieng Jen, the {{director}} of the DAP's by-election campaign, pointed out <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> decided not to renew their 60-year land leases would have their land returned to the government without compensation, and that even if the government approved requests to have leases renewed, landholders would have to pay large premiums. Chong said that the DAP on the other hand wanted the current state land code to be amended to allow for the automatic and unconditional renewal of all leased land for a period of 99 years.|$|E
5|$|The whole {{dramatic}} {{moral of}} Coriolanus is <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> have little shall have less, and <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> have much shall take all {{that others have}} left. The people are poor; therefore {{they ought to be}} starved. They are slaves; therefore they ought to be beaten. They work hard; therefore they ought to be treated like beasts of burden. They are ignorant; therefore they ought not to be allowed to feel that they want food, or clothing, or rest, that they are enslaved, oppressed, and miserable. This is the logic of the imagination and the passions; which seek to aggrandise what excites admiration and to heap contempt on misery, to raise power into tyranny, and to make tyranny absolute; to thrust down that which is low still lower, and to make wretches desperate: to exalt magistrates into kings, kings into gods; to degrade subjects to the rank of slaves, and slaves to the condition of brutes. The history of mankind is a romance, a mask, a tragedy, constructed upon the principles of poetical justice; it is a noble or royal hunt, in which what is sport to the few is death to the many, and in which the spectators halloo and encourage the strong to set upon the weak, and cry havoc in the chase though they do not share in the spoil. We may depend upon it that what men delight to read in books, they will put in practice in reality.|$|E
5|$|Verses 10.19–23 advise <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> seek liberation in life {{or after}} death, should do yoga and reach {{the stage of}} Samadhi wherein one fixes one's mind on the supreme self. This is {{recommended}} for those in their advanced years and seekers of inner liberation and peace. Yajnavalkya suggests to Gargi that she should meditate on the self in her through yoga, and thus attain nirvana.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of the schism, Irvine {{believed}} <b>that</b> all <b>those</b> <b>who</b> died in [...] "The Testimony" [...] prior to 3 August 1914 were saved, but <b>that</b> only <b>those</b> <b>who</b> followed his continuing message could be saved. [...] Ironically, both the workers and Irvine firmly believed they had God's only true message on earth at that time, so now there were two [...] "only right way" [...] methods on earth, both of which arose from Irvine's revelations.|$|R

Odessa City Council deputy Dmitry Spivak also said {{that some of the}} rioters were from Transnistria. The Interior Ministry stated that the identity of most of the victims had not been determined on 2 May, despite these reports. On the day after the clashes, the Odessa office of the Interior Ministry issued another statement saying <b>that</b> eight of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> died in the fire were identified, and that all of them were from Odessa.

5|$|After {{six months}} of development, Slither.io was {{released}} for browsers and iOS on March 25, 2016, with servers supporting up to 500 players. Two days after the iOS/browser versions' release, an Android version was made available by Lowtech Studios. The only way Howse could make revenue was to display advertising in the app after the player's snake died; this option could be removed for US$3.99. He chose not to sell virtual currency or power-ups so <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> paid would not have an advantage over players who didn't. As {{there was no money}} to advertise for the game, the only way to advertise was the various let's plays by players on YouTube, including PewDiePie, who had more than 47 million subscribers at the time.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} part of the work was devoted to the miracles and glorification of Ely's patroness, Saint Æthelthryth. The very beginning of the work incorporates an earlier Vita, or Life, of Æthelthryth, which resembles the Vitae of other saints written by Goscelin in the 11th century; Goscelin is known to have visited Ely. The work may have helped {{to increase the number of}} pilgrims visiting Ely, as well as enabling the monks to better explain the history of earlier donations to the abbey. Many of the gifts to the abbey church are described, such as the altar cloth donated by Queen Emma (died 1052), wife of both King Æthelred II (died 1016) and King Cnut (died 1035), with a short history of the circumstances of the gift. The miracle stories frequently say <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> wished cures or miracles similar to those in the Liber would need to come to the monastery, where they could make a donation. The historian Jennifer Paxton argues that increasing pilgrimage to the monastery was one of the main goals of the compilers of the Liber.|$|E
5|$|Augustine {{believed}} that a physical Hell exists, but that physical punishment is secondary to the punishment of being separated from God. He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to follow God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell. Secondly, he {{believed that}} Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that humans are left unable to resist sin. Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only be saved {{if they choose to}} receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> choose God's grace will still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.|$|E
