The limitation on the set-point using conversional controller would be overcome by using an advanced control method that is MPC. In direct comparison, we show that MPC algorithm would give better performance due to future prediction potential compare to conventional controller that is PI. The capabilities of MPC have been tested with three different inputs which represent the real mechanistic behaviors of chemical plant through the Simulink/MATLAB 7. 0 simulations. The MPC algorithm is believed can capture the nonlinear and robust of Vinyl Acetate Monomer process that refers to real chemical industries...|$|R
40|$|A {{conceptual}} design {{study of the}} resistojet orbital replacement unit (ORU) was conducted. The ORU consists of four 500 -W multipropellant resistojets, fluid components downstream of the waste fluid storage subsystem, a power controller, structure, and micrometeorite shielding.

Separate fluid components are provided for oxidizing fluids, reducing fluids and water. Different flow and power control methods were studied.

40|$|Preliminary {{resistojet}} {{design requirements}} were established based on initial technical requirements {{imposed by the}} results of NASA and Rocketdyne studies. The requirements are directed toward long life, simplicity, flexibility, and commonality with other space station components. The resistojet assembly is comprised of eight resistojets, fluid components downstream of the waste fluid storage system, a power controller, structure, and shielding. It consists of two identical subassemblies, one of which is redundant. Each subassembly consists of four 500 -W resistojets, series redundant latch values, a power controller, a water <b>vaporizer,</b> two <b>pressure</b> <b>regulators,</b> filters, check valves, disconnects, fluid tubing, and electrical cables. All components are packaged {{at the end of the}} stinger aft of the JEM and Columbus modules. Different flow and power control methods were studied. A constant inlet pressure and a two-power setting controller were tentatively selected based on simplicity and reasonably high specific impulse for the range of waste gas compositions that are anticipated. The constant pressure is supplied by <b>pressure</b> <b>regulators.</b> The two set point power control includes individual power supplies to each resistojet heater and water vaporizer. An embedded data processor, a multiplexer-demultiplexer, and a network interface unit that are standard space station components are included in the power controller.

40|$|Three water vaporizers {{designed}} for resistojet applications were built and tested for periods up to 500 h and 250 thermal cycles. Two of <b>the</b> <b>vaporizers</b> were not sensitive to orientation {{with respect to}} gravity, an indication of likely compatibility with low-gravity environments. Some temperatures and pressures in the third were impacted by orientation, although operation was always stable. The pressure drop across the sand-filled version increased by 147 percent in 38 h and 19 thermal cycles.

40|$|Large mobile {{irrigation}} {{machines are}} becoming a common sight in Australian broadacre irrigation, replacing traditional surface methods. These machines give the potential of irrigating large areas with high efficiency and with a uniformity of above 80 % when designed correctly. A major component of the large mobile irrigation machine is the sprinkler application package commissioned with the machine. <b>Pressure</b> <b>regulators</b> {{are becoming a}} common {{part of the package}} when large mobile irrigation machines are commissioned. <b>Pressure</b> <b>regulators</b> are installed upstream of the nozzle and provide a constant output pressure regardless of the input pressure into the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator.</b> The device acts as a variable headloss. Input pressure changes are a common occurrence on large mobile irrigation machines and typically are from topographic changes as the machines travel through the field. The application rate is directly influenced by the output pressure from the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator,</b> thus this shows the importance of accurately understanding to performance of the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator.</b> Reviewing previous literature it was known that the methodology development was a crucial part in understanding the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> performance.

The gold standard technique for this purpose is to measure the weight difference of <b>the</b> <b>vaporizer</b> that occurs during VA delivery. Because suitable equipment is rarely available and weighing <b>the</b> <b>vaporizer</b> is only possible in prospectively planned fashion, a calculation method from recorded fresh gas flow (FGF) and VA courses is a viable alternative.
