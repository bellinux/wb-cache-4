As her gaze disappeared into the crystal ball, the seer murmured, “Show me, magic sphere, a vision of the future. ” 0 ur stereotyped concept of envisioning the future through a cystal ball has changed dramatically in re-cent years. The Delphi method, trend extrapolations, futures wheels, and cross-force analyses are among the common methods employed today by futurists envisioning alternative futures. Another useful and creative tool used by futurists is the scenario, a writing exercise which creates a word picture of the future. As Edward Cornish, President of the World Future Society, explains: “A scenario may sound exotic, but in its simplest form, it is very common. It is simply a series of events that we imagine happening in the future. Our everyday thinking is filled with little ventures into the mysterious world of <b>tomorrow,</b> <b>or</b> <b>next</b> <b>week,</b> or next year. And these ventures are scenarios. ” (Cornish, 1977) By Dawn L. Shewach The scenario allows us to explore many variables in the future, without actually manipulating or experimenting with the present. The Future Problem Solving Sce-nario Writing Program adds a com-ponent to the scenario technique that has significant appeal to students: creative writing. The program uses a short-short story format (1, 500 words), because it is a n excellent vehicle for a young author. Its form is simple and unencumbered by complex plots and multiple characters. It is relatively easy to explain and understand. It per-sonalizes the information being ex-plored: The short-short story establish-es contact between the knowledge being gained on the topic and the scenario writer.

People delay writing up their research (so we hear!), repeatedly declare they will start their diets <b>tomorrow,</b> <b>or</b> postpone until <b>next</b> <b>week</b> doing odd jobs around the house. Yet people also sometimes attempt to control their procrastination by setting deadlines for themselves. In this article, we pose three questions: (a) Are people willing to self-impose meaningful (i. e., costly) deadlines to overcome procrastination? (b) Are self-imposed deadlines effective in improving task performance? (c) When self-imposing deadlines, do people set them optimally, for maximum performance enhancement? A set of studies examined these issues experimentally, showing {{that the answer is}} "yes" to the first two questions, and "no" to the third. People have self-control problems, they recognize them, and they try to control them by self-imposing costly deadlines. These deadlines help people control procrastination, but they are not as effective as some externally imposed deadlines in improving task performance...|$|R

40|$|Jack Waterford, {{editor-in-chief}} of the Canberra Times, grew up in north-west NSW, an area now hard hit by drought. In mid-October he {{headed back to the}} town where he was born, Coonamble, and to the Goodooga property where he grew up. This is the first of Waterford’s reports on the impact of the drought on the region and its people. SOME things never change. In the north-west of NSW drought is an inevitable, even a usual, part {{of the life of the}} land. It’s a good year if there is 250 mm of rain, about the average annual rainfall, but, over a cycle of 30 years, one won’t get half that in 10 to 12 seasons, some of which will run years in a row. It’s not a predictable cycle either. It might mean seven straight good years or seven bad ones. When there’s no moisture in the soil, the black soil begins to crack, the grasses dry out quickly and the land begins to gasp. Stock are well-watered, though the earth dams quickly dry out in the sun and become a muddy trap for sheep and cattle. The country sits on the great artesian basin, and the first drought-proofing, 100 years ago, saw the land networked with artesian bores, some 1200 m deep drawing up hot, often mineralised but nearly always drinkable water from the aquifers below. For most of the century the water ran into drains flowing 20 or 30 km through the paddocks, most of it evaporating in summer temperatures which reach 47 degrees. A remarkably successful program has seen most of these bores capped and the drains filled in, the water instead reticulated - by buried polythene pipe - to troughs which do not produce muddy ground where weakened sheep bog themselves and become exposed to crows. Hand-feeding is ruinously expensive, but nothing compared with the cost of carting water for thirsty stock. The drought is three or four years old in parts of the western lands division north and west of the Darling River. In the regions adjoining, it is up to two years old. In impact, it is worse than the common or garden drought to which almost all are inured because it followed poor or indifferent seasons which ate into any fat. Already the cost to the national income is several billion dollars this year. It will be more into further years, even if it breaks soon, which it may well not do. Walgett Shire, by no means as badly hit as country around Brewarrina or Bourke, has probably lost $ 250 million in the past year, according to its Mayor, Peter Waterford. And that’s not just reduced farm or station income. “WELL, actually I’m a bit of a gentleman of leisure at the moment,” my cousin Bill Burnheim said as we apologised for disturbing his routines by invading his household this week. “First and foremost, I’m a wheat farmer, and I didn’t put any wheat in. The crunch comes for me next year, or whenever it rains, when I have to put wheat in with seed I haven’t got. ” He’s just, if just is the word for it, doing a year without income, and facing the prospect that it could get worse. Bill’s in his 40 s, the last of his three kids still at school, with perhaps a million dollars worth of farming plant which needs as much servicing at the bank as on the property itself. His current pride and joy is a bulldozer tractor which, he hopes, will allow him to maintain a line of ploughing that is within 5 cm, either way, of Global Positioning System grids - a little more sophisticated for him since he hasn’t cleared trees in his farming paddock, as some of his neighbours have. The science, the technology, and, in many cases, the environmental friendliness of the farming continues to improve each year. Bill has been in droughts as bad before, but they are factored into his calculations and he’s not complaining, even as he is being hit. Indeed, he and some partners are planning an expansion into even more marginal country around the Narran Lakes, where the drought is far more severe than in his area. He last had rain that mattered in November 2000. KEN Waterford, on the other hand, is doing it fairly tough at the moment. Ken’s main property is at Come-by-Chance, about 45 km east of Bill, and while Ken also is seriously into wheat, he runs sheep and cattle as well. He has not substantially destocked, as many have, and is spending about $ 5000 a week, which he doesn’t have, feeding them grain and hay in the hope that the weather breaks, or at least so he still has a strong breeding base when rain comes. We watched him feeding stock at both his Come-by-Chance property, and at Carawatha, near Quambone, about 100 km to the west. The stock are in fine fettle - as they should be, given the royal treatment they are receiving - and, if his land is pretty bare, it hasn’t been exporting its dust, yet, to Canberra. The town economies are badly hit. There’s hardly any work on most of the sheep properties, and none at all on the wheat operations. Contractors are involved in spraying and weed control, in ploughing and harvesting. Few are buying farm equipment or consuming fuel and fertiliser. Truckies may be doing well transporting sheep and fodder, but there is no work carting wheat to the railheads. When farmers and the graziers feel the pinch, the towns feel strangulation, though they are rarely the direct beneficiaries of any relief operations. I come from these parts and grew up with droughts. But the modern drought, although it comes in the same cycles, is quite different. Yet, in some respects the signs are quite encouraging. Some snapshots: In the big ’ 60 s drought, probably 10 million sheep, half the population, starved to death. Even those who saw the drought coming and tried to sell or move stock found it quickly worthless on a sharply declining market - even more worthless, of course, as the drought took hold and sheep became skin and bone. The optimists who imported wheat and hay - and there was none produced locally then - might keep their sheep and cattle barely alive at incredible expense, knowing that, when the drought broke, they would be forced to rebuild their flocks on suddenly expensive markets. Not only was it hardly ever economically justifiable in cash terms, but it had serious capital and environmental consequences: land was “flogged” to the point that regrowth was slower and the land more susceptible to weeds, trees were cut so that sheep could get some green from the leaves, rabbits and other pests multiplied, and areas were scarified by the salt rising up and the crusting of the sun. It was much the same in the ’ 80 s drought, with desperate farmers unable to move from overstocked country often taking a bounty from government to shoot sheep. Bad as the current drought has been, the general response to worsening conditions has been exemplary. This time around, as the drought developed, most graziers reduced their stock holdings quickly. Miraculously, the store sheep market has held up, with prices staying reasonable. More than 80 per cent of graziers are probably carrying fewer than 20 per cent of the stock they would carry in a reasonable season, and some, facing the facts, have none. But that, of course, means no income as well, and, when the country picks up, a big bill on a seller’s market as they restock. The same applies to farming operations, an increasing feature of this landscape, which in a good season produces prime hard wheat on land as flat as a biscuit. If moisture means money for the grazier, moisture and nitrogen mean money for the farmer, and some farmers will recover all of their lost income and useless interest payments with one bumper crop. Whenever that is. Yet it’s a measure of the fact that the farmers and the graziers are in some cooperation with this environment that land prices have not fallen during this drought. In many cases they have risen, and some of the big corporate owners have not stopped investing. Those who hold on to stock must feed them. There is little natural food about. The irony is that much of the stock being fed looks in remarkably good condition. But it costs. It costs my cousin Ken about $ 8 a head a week to feed hay and grain to his cattle and at least $ 2 a head a week to feed grain to his sheep. $ 5000 a week, and two long trips a week to Carawatha, his father’s old property near Quambone, to feed the stock he has there, on top of his feeding operations at his property near Come-by-Chance. Ken is a wheat farmer in a big way too, but the drought hits both his operations as severely. Wayne Leigh, of Cobar, who leases land near Lightning Ridge, is also holding on to stock. He reckons that by the time the drought is over, he will be more than $ 200, 000 in the red from feeding. He will never get that money back, even if his stock survive and prices bloom after it rains. Deciding to feed stock becomes a bit like a drug addiction, he says. If you’ve done so, it’s very hard to stop, even if it will cost much more than the stock is worth, or you have exhausted your resources. If it rains it will have been worthwhile. Even if it doesn’t you feel you have gone so far and that stopping is ceding defeat. A HUNDRED kilometres away, Andy Crawford, a grazier who farms, says he has enough feed to see him into next winter. He took wheat from his last crop, two years ago, and buried it in pits in the ground, covered with plastic and covered over. He has about six mounds - each a big truckload - left. He knows drought in his country and regards the laying down of feed as simply part of the cycle of working the land. Like the others, his bores now come through pipes, and his remaining sheep - he would be down to about half his normal holding, keeping his breeding ewes - are fat and healthy, not weak and emaciated, even as they walk over bare paddocks gasping for water. Ken and Andy would be carrying as many kangaroos - a very high proportion young joeys abandoned by their mothers and emus in plague proportions - as they would have sheep or cattle. While there is standing water in the troughs, and some picking from the hay, the oats and the wheat, most will survive, if in a worse state than the sheep. Anthony O’Brien, a further 100 km away, sowed barley which, with some chance local rain, made it perhaps a foot high. He’s stripping it, if only because the kangaroos are getting more of the benefit of it than his sheep, which are sharply reduced in number. Like the others, he’s not complaining or claiming dire emergency even as he points out the economic impact in the towns and chats of particular people doing it tough. The drought is hitting his income, not killing his stock. Like the others, Anthony is contemptuous of solutions involving turning rivers back. Commonwealth and state drought assistance has been slow in coming, and highly bureaucratic in its investigation of whether the landholders are facing “exceptional circumstances” - a question of whether, even in drought terms, income has been hit beyond the ordinary. Too much of the relief which then becomes available to people who qualify is going to schemes subsidising transport costs or fodder, which probably ends up driving up already high prices. Not enough of the money is going either into family welfare relief to help with the grocery bills or to those just as directly stricken by the drought, the townspeople and contract workforce now completely out of an income source. They too, perhaps, must factor in drought, but it could hardly be said that they live off the fat of the land, even in good times. Delivering help, and quickly, has been compromised by the depopulation of Commonwealth and even state government officials as government became more “efficient” in the 1990 s. Just as little towns have lost banks, and shops, and services, they have lost government services, now centralised in, say, a Dubbo, 200 km away, or even a Sydney, 700 or more kilometres away. Not only has this destocking affected capacities to respond quickly, but it has made administration and politics far more impersonal, far less flexible and far less responsive to individual circumstances. But some welfare is counter-cyclical, now not only the mainstay of the towns but providing some fresh opportunities. In Coonamble we visited a large-scale Aboriginal Community Development Employment Project, providing training and employment for a total of about 50 people. A major project is an orchard, with several fully qualified orchardists, including David Murray from Quambone, producing oranges and other citrus crops, but also supplementing its income by welding fences and producing fruit juices. About 20 people are involved in a work-for-the-dole scheme devised years before the formal ones. More are employed in other CDEP schemes such as house-building and refurbishment and with shire street-care and garden contracts. Another project involves making and selling sporting uniforms in the district. Most of these projects are tied into training programs focused on developing work skills and work habits in young Aboriginal men and women who have little experience either in the workforce or the habit of working. Up at Engonnia, 300 km to the north west, three of the Crawford brothers - a versatile lot with most of the trades between them - are seeing out the drought by working on an Aboriginal housing project where the focus for them is not so much direct building but supervision and developing building skills in the local Aboriginal population. Another counter-cyclical project seems to be bridge-building. Walgett shire appears to have replaced every bridge -Â it has about 60 - in recent years. Most have yet to see water underneath, though they will be useful enough when it rains - this drought country has seen 17 floods as well since 1890 - if it rains, as in time it will. But whether it will be <b>tomorrow,</b> <b>or</b> <b>next</b> <b>week,</b> or next month, or next year, or the year after is the question. Not everything can be planned for.
