500|$|In 1994, Conran {{set up a}} bluescreen in {{his living}} room and began {{assembling}} the tools he would need to create his movie. He was not interested in working his way through the system and instead wanted to follow the route of independent filmmakers like Steven Soderbergh. Initially, Kerry and his brother had nothing more than [...] "just a vague idea of this guy who flew a plane. We would <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> obvious things like Indiana Jones and all the stuff we liked." [...] Conran spent four years making a black and white teaser trailer in the style of an old-fashioned movie serial on his Macintosh IIci personal computer. Once he was finished, Conran showed it to producer Marsha Oglesby, who was a friend of his brother's wife and she recommended that he let producer Jon Avnet see it. Conran met Avnet and showed him the trailer. Conran told him that he wanted to make it into a movie. They spent two or three days just talking about the tone of the movie.|$|E

It is at this festival that the men and women <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> courtly adventures from the past year and compose lais in remembrance of them. At this particular gathering, a group of women begin to discuss the reasons why the knights go off in search of adventure, and one woman offers a simple solution: the knight is interested in the woman's vagina (Old French: con). The other ladies agree, and they compose a lai, which is well received in the land.|$|E
5000|$|Susan and Mike cannot decide a {{name for}} their new baby boy, but they decided to name him Conner after hearing a [...] "doctor Conner" [...] being paged in the hospital. When Mike discovers his {{maternal}} grandfather has died, he wants to name the boy after him. Susan is pleased until she finds out the name is Maynard. Gaby, Lynette, and Bree all tell Susan that the name is unfit, and that she should think about Maynard's future. Susan decides to change the name to Conner, and Mike finds out. After a <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> things that Grandfather Maynard had done, the couple settles on Maynard.|$|E
5000|$|People <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> money I've made. But {{they never}} <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> money I've lost. Casey Stengel Stengel's {{six years in}} Toledo would be {{as long as he}} would spend {{anywhere}} as manager, except his time with the Yankees of the 1950s. McGraw sent talented players down to Toledo, and the Mud Hens threatened for the pennant in Stengel's first year before falling back to third. In 1927, the team won its first pennant and defeated the Buffalo Bisons, five games to one, in the Little World Series. Stengel missed part of the 1927 campaign, as he was suspended by the league for inciting the fans to attack the umpire after a close play during {{the first game of the}} Labor Day doubleheader. Stengel continued as an occasional player in addition to his managerial role, hitting a game-winning home run (the last of his professional career) in 1927 for the Mud Hens. He pinch hit and played the outfield during the 1926 to 1929 seasons, and played two games in 1931, at the age of 41. Since minor league clubs suffer large turnovers in their rosters, the team's success did not carry over to 1928, when it finished sixth, and then eighth in the eight-team league in 1929. The team recovered for third in 1930, but by then both Stengel and the team (in which he had invested) were having financial problems due to the start of the Great Depression. The team finished last again in 1931, and, after Landis was convinced no money had been skimmed off to benefit Stengel and other insiders, the team went into receivership, and Stengel was fired.|$|E

60|$|The dragon-fly {{did come}} back, and chatted away with Tom. He {{was a little}} {{conceited}} about his fine colours and his large wings; but you know, {{he had been a}} poor dirty ugly creature all his life before; so there were great excuses for him. He was very fond of <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> wonderful things he saw in the trees and the meadows; and Tom liked to listen to him, for he had forgotten <b>all</b> <b>about</b> them. So in a little while they became great friends.|$|R

He told one reporter: [...] "All of a sudden they're accusing me of conspiracy to import marijuana and cocaine. Hey, what about all the other things I've been into for the last 15 years, lets talk about them. Let's talk about the Martin Luther King thing, let's talk about Don Freed, Le Coubre, nigger-killers in bed with the Mafia, the Mafia in bed with the FBI, and the goddamn CIA in bed with all of them. Let's <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> people I dirtied up for them over the years." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Centre de l'Imaginaire Arthurien has the {{objectives}} of {{reaching out to the}} general public on the Arthurian legends, disseminating artistic works (writing, visual arts, music, street arts, storytelling...), promoting the Matter of Britain to contemporary creatives so that they understand and perpetuate it, and enhancing the legendary cultural heritage. In an interview with France 3, Claudine Glot summarised the aims of the Centre by saying that it has a vocation to attract enthusiasts of the Celtic, medieval and Arthurian worlds, and <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> works that they inspire, including Heroic Fantasy. It disseminates all that is artistically or historically related to the Arthurian legends and the Forest of Brocéliande and is seen as an organisation that [...] "maintains the myth".

5000|$|One of {{the most}} notable episodes, [...] "The Great MacGrady" [...] (co-sponsored by the Lance Armstrong Foundation) deals with the topic issue of cancer (a topic that had only been {{addressed}} once in an animated series). Executive producer Jacqui Deegan comments on the WGBH press release: [...] "Cancer affects nearly everyone in some way. We hope that this two-part episode will empower kids, families and caregivers to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> feelings that can come up when a loved one has cancer, {{and how they can}} work together and remain positive and hopeful through difficult times." [...] The episode premiered during the week-long programming block A Very Special Arthur. The episode's ending features a dedication to Leah Ryan, a former Arthur writer who died from leukemia on June 12, 2008. The character of Mrs. MacGrady was renamed Leah MacGrady in Ryan's honor.|$|E
40|$|This {{recording}} {{begins with}} prayer and singing. A man reads about the Lord redeeming {{people that were}} wandering in the desert.

He <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> trouble that is rampant in the world, and {{how important it is to}} serve the Lord. This leads to a call and response about how people may need to be in trouble and during that time the Lord will minister to them...|$|R

Written and {{composed}} by her, [...] "Pies Descalzos, Sueños Blancos" [...] <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> rules that the human race has invented since Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit. It is a social satire in both the lyrics and the music video.

"21 Things I Want in a Lover" [...] (sometimes {{referred}} as just [...] "21 Things") {{is a song}} recorded by Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette for her fifth studio album, Under Rug Swept (2002). [...] "21 Things I Want in a Lover" [...] was all written, arranged and produced by Morissette. It is an alternative rock and pop rock song, with post-grunge influences, featuring guitarist Dean DeLeo of Stone Temple Pilots.

They can have it in their hands, who I was." [...] Regarding a book based on her life, she has said, [...] "I wouldn't write a book unless I could really tell the truth, and say all the people are in it are represented right ... If I'm gonna <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> people in my life, I need to be old enough and so do they, that nobody's gonna care ... I would never write a book about the bad parts. I would mostly revel in the fantastic parts, of which there were so many." ...|$|E

5000|$|Right {{after that}} he stopped working in {{animation}} {{for a while and}} dedicated wholly to creating Disney comics. When in 1956 Italian editors had no more new Floyd Gottfredson's stories to reprint, he was given the responsibility to continue Gottfredson's stories about Mickey Mouse. Also influenced by Carl Barks in the late Fifties and up to about 1963 he wrote and penciled stories like Topolino e la collana Chirikawa (1960) or The Flying Scot (1957) that have, later, been translated in many different languages throughout the world. Many of these stories have their backgrounds in movies, for example Topolino nel favoloso regno di Shan Grillà (1961) is based upon Frank Capra's Lost Horizon (1937); not to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> stories starring Snow White or the Seven Dwarfs, obviously based on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). Sometimes the exact opposite happened; the Italian movie Riusciranno i nostri eroi a ritrovare l'amico misteriosamente scomparso in Africa? (1968) is based on Scarpa's story Topolino e il Pippotarzan (1957).|$|E

The reason I can’t accomplish what I want to accomplish is because I’m doing all this dumb shit. I put it all together on the album. Like, ‘Druggys Wit Hoes,’ I’m out here drugging and I’m not even trying to fuck with hoes. ‘Kamikaze,’ I’m not even trying to rap—keep going broke. Different shit like that, I sum it up all in one album. My life did a whole 180 after that dropped. A lot of people still didn’t know the name though, {{but a lot of people}} did. It was weird. It just took me to the right spot. I made some fucking money off the project, it helped me see that I needed to do more positive shit in life, and it made me into the person I am now. All I do now is just chill. I’d rather just chill, work on my music, be with my two-year-old daughter, and smoke weed and shit." [...] Two weeks after the album's release ScHoolboy Q released it for free via his Twitter feed.

40|$|When we {{talk about}} {{security}} in reference to a computer system, we <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> facilities and features needed to avoid that unauthorized people are capable to access to sensitive data. Security is a crucial matter and it is achieve in different way, {{one of those is}} cryptography. Cryptography allows to protect user data as long as the keys used to crypt data are safe. A means to store in a secure way this information is constituted by smart card. Of the size of a credit card, they are provided with compute capabilities and storage facilities. More powerful has been supplied with a dedicated hardware for cryptographic operations. In the past, development of smart card based applications, has been hindered by the lack of an open API, and this lack has been overcome with the efforts of Schlumberger to introduce Java Card. Despite this, the development process on open platforms was however hindered by the lack of drivers, specications and documentations typically available for commercial platforms only. Aims of the MUSCLE card team was to give a way to spread this technology on open platforms. Today, the MUSCLE card framework is widely used in the open source community, allowing users to sign document by means of a smart card device. Aims of this master degree thesis is to overcome some limitation of this framework. After a brief presentation of Java Card, MUSCLE Card and related concepts, we discuss {{the state of the art}} of the framework, the proposed modication and how these has been brought...|$|E
40|$|Security {{officers}} play a {{vital role}} in the day to day experience of students. Coming from a youth perspective, our report contains recommendations based on our school experience that can create a more comfortable and friendly environment for both students and security officers. Students are the ones who come in the most contact with security officers and we feel students should have a voice when it comes to expectations and supports security officer should receive. If we can improve communication between security officers and students, we can begin to work together as equal partners in improving schools. Our research asks "How can Chicago Public Schools better train, support and evaluate security officers?" This question was important to research because we believe that security officers have an impact on youth, whether it be positive or negative on a daily basis. We also believe it is a question most adults do not often ask themselves but is one that students <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time. Most adults do not realize the impact that security officers can have on a school's culture and a student's learning. A security officer's job is hardly ever limited to what is written in the job description. We spent more than 120 hours researching this issue. We met with other groups and people researching similar topics, including principals, CPS security officers, the Head of Citywide Security Trainings and a union representative from SEIU's local 73, which represents security officers. We visited several schools and discussed their safety plans and the role security officers played in creating an inviting and secure learning environment. We've seen administrators work with students to have them charged with "keeping the peace" and security officers actively seek mentoring opportunities through which they engage with students. These are strong examples of students and security officers working together to create positive, healthy relationships that in turn create a less violent atmosphere at the school...|$|E
