5|$|American photojournalist Andrew Kaulder (Scoot McNairy) {{receives}} {{a call from}} his employer, who tasks Andrew with finding his daughter, Samantha Wynden (Whitney Able), and escorting {{her back to the}} US. Andrew locates Samantha in a Mexican hospital and the pair board a train, until learning the tracks ahead have been damaged. They discover <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not leave the country within a few days, sea and air travel will be blocked for six months. Andrew and Samantha decide to hitchhike their way to the coast.|$|E
5|$|He {{finds himself}} {{back in his}} car, handcuffed, but {{relieved}} {{to see that the}} green reality Bird is still alive. He gives Bird Hawkins' password ("tulip"), and the information regarding Kessel and the shipping container convinces Bird that something is wrong. He takes Michael to Harper still in cuffs but they both tell her what they have learned. Harper approves Bird's plan to send a team to the storage container but sends Michael to a cell, saying <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not find any evidence of his accusations, he'll go to jail for killing Hawkins.|$|E

50|$|Archibald {{threatens the}} monsters; <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> {{not go back}} to the stories then he would send them to a soppy love story. The ashamed monsters vanish.|$|R
60|$|Uncle Alec, however, {{stood by}} her staunchly {{and helped her}} out of many of her woes by good advice and an {{occasional}} visit of inspection, which did much to impress upon the dwellers there the fact <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not do their part, their leases would be short ones.|$|R
25|$|Captives {{who were}} {{confined}} to both Bagram and the Guantanamo Bay detention camp have recounted that, while in Bagram, <b>they</b> were warned <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not cooperate more fully, they {{would be sent to}} a worse site in Cuba.|$|R
25|$|The Navier–Stokes {{equations}} {{are also}} {{of great interest}} in a purely mathematical sense. Despite their wide range of practical uses {{it has not yet}} been proven that in three dimensions solutions always exist, or <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> exist, then they are smooth, i.e. they do not contain any mathematical singularity. These are called the Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness problems. The Clay Mathematics Institute has called this one of the seven most important open problems in mathematics and has offered a US$1,000,000 prize for a solution or a counterexample.|$|E
500|$|The cat hurries {{ahead of}} the coach, {{ordering}} the country folk {{along the road to}} tell the king that the land belongs to the [...] "Marquis of Carabas", saying <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not he will cut them into mincemeat. The cat then happens upon a castle inhabited by an ogre who is capable of transforming himself into a number of creatures. The ogre displays his ability by changing into a lion, frightening the cat, who then tricks the ogre into changing into a mouse. The cat then pounces upon the mouse and devours it. The king arrives at the castle that formerly belonged to the ogre, and, impressed with the bogus Marquis and his estate, gives the lad the princess in marriage. Thereafter, the cat enjoys life as a great lord who runs after mice only for his own amusement.|$|E
500|$|That night, Michael, Vega and the SWAT team {{watch the}} {{warehouse}} {{but no one}} shows up; Vega wonders if Jake had given incorrect information. Back in the [...] "green reality", Michael goes to the hotel, since Alina had left {{in the middle of}} the night. Once there, Marcus warns Michael and Bird <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not find her, Marcus will give himself up to Maxim Basayev, his mobster boss. Back at the station, after looking at evidence, Michael decides to talk to the hotel staff where Alina and Marcus are staying, with Bird, rather than Alina's friends. Later, Michael and Bird go to the home of Greg Hollander (Ron Melendez), one of Alina's friends, but do not find Greg, the person they would like to question regarding Alina's whereabouts. Hollander, who is tied up, kicks down a table as the detectives leave, notifying the cops that he is in there. As the criminals run away, Bird and Michael break into the house; Bird and Michael enter the house, while Bird shoots the two gang members. After that, they speak to Greg, who tells them that Alina constantly talks about how she and her husband have grown apart. Michael goes to search for Alina at a beach and finds her there. The two talk about Marcus and everything that happened previously. Michael explains that she has a chance to start over and takes her back to the hotel. In the [...] "red reality", at Jake's home, Jake says he and Vega can have dinner alone to get to know each other. That night, Michael and Hannah go nude swimming at the college pool.|$|E
50|$|This gesture was {{interpreted}} by the natives as a warning <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not retreat, <b>they</b> would suffer the same fate as their chiefs. Incredibly, they turned around and started the retreat {{even though they had}} victory in their hands.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile {{the captain}} {{stepped up to}} the Portuguese sailors and told them to mind their own business, and let honest men alone; adding, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not take his advice, he would first give them a licking and then pitch them all into the river.|$|R
25|$|Sprint Nextel {{announced}} in March 2010 that Virgin Mobile USA would stop providing service to its Helio post-paid customers. Sprint Nextel offered Helio customers incentives {{to switch to}} Sprint branded service and were told <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> nothing their service would be disconnected on May 25, 2010.|$|R

2500|$|A {{large number}} of chiropractors fear <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not {{separate}} themselves from the traditional vitalistic concept of innate intelligence, chiropractic {{will continue to be}} seen as a fringe profession. A variant of chiropractic called naprapathy originated in Chicago in the early twentieth century. It holds that manual manipulation of soft tissue can reduce [...] "interference" [...] in the body and thus improve health.|$|E
2500|$|Those Trokosi who {{are sent}} by families, often against {{the will of}} the girl involved, out of fear <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not do so, further calamities may afflict them through the anger of the shrine deities. This last group {{consists}} of those vestal virgins who are sent into servitude at the shrines of the Troxovi due to crimes allegedly committed by their senior or elder family members, almost always males like fathers, grandfathers, and uncles. [...] The trokosi is sort of a [...] "living sacrifice," [...] who by her suffering is thought to save the family from trouble.|$|E
60|$|George {{had taken}} {{with him all}} the money he had, which was a trifle over two hundred dollars, since they might not only be gone a long while, but it was quite {{possible}} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> recover the team, they would be obliged to incur some heavy expenses.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{told them}} it was {{addressed}} to you," [...] she said, eyeing him sternly, [...] "does it not occur to you that they would send for you to question you, and <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> so, as you are a gentleman you could not lie away my brother's life." ...|$|R
5000|$|Berta Geissmar {{described}} Furtwängler as a, [...] "genius compounded {{of intellectual}} directness {{and an almost}} excessive shyness: whose timidity made him efface himself in any gathering, but who had such a great attraction for women <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not fall victim to his musical genius, they were fascinated by his personality." ...|$|R
2500|$|Internet {{censorship}} in China {{has been}} called [...] "a panopticon that encourages self-censorship through the perception that users are being watched". The enforcement (or threat of enforcement) of censorship creates a chilling effect where individuals and businesses willingly censor their own communications to avoid legal and economic repercussions. ISPs and other service providers are legally liable for customers' conduct. The service providers have assumed an editorial role with regard to customer content, thus becoming publishers and legally responsible for libel and other torts committed by customers. Some hotels in China advise Internet users to obey local Chinese Internet access rules by leaving a list of Internet rules and guidelines near the computers. These rules, among other things, forbid linking to politically unacceptable messages, and inform Internet users <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> {{they will have to}} face legal consequences.|$|E
2500|$|However, in a 2012 interview, Ebadi has stated: [...] "The [...] {{people want}} to stop {{enrichment}} but the government doesn't listen. Iran is situated on a fault line and people are scared of a Fukushima type of situation happening. We want peace, security, and economic welfare, and we cannot forgo all of our other rights for nuclear energy. The government claims it is not making a bomb. But I am {{not a member of}} the government, so I cannot speak to this directly. The fear is <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> Israel will be wiped out. If the Iranian people are able to topple the government, this could improve the situation. [...] the people of Iran rose up and were badly suppressed. Right now, Iran is the country with the most journalists in prison. This is the price people are paying." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hazlitt {{concludes with}} a lengthy {{quotation}} from the [...] "Peter Grimes" [...] letter in The Borough, characterising it as [...] "an exact fac-simile {{of some of the}} most unlovely parts of the creation." [...] He allows, however, that Crabbe's poetry in Tales is more readable than that in his earlier collection Poems. Still oppressive, this later poetry contains [...] "highly finished, striking, and original portraits", with acute psychological insight, [...] "an intimate knowledge of the small and intricate folds of the human heart." [...] There is enough that is striking, even [...] "profound", so <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not affect us as [...] "entertaining" [...] or [...] "delightful", they compel us to read on, even if once you lay the poems down [...] "you never wish to take them up again". Thus [...] "they will remain, 'as a thorn in the side of poetry,' perhaps for a century to come!" ...|$|E
6000|$|MARGARET. Whats {{the use of}} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>dont</b> {{choose to}} believe it? You dont believe it yourself, or you wouldnt pay policemen to twist their arms.

50|$|Many {{attempts}} to mediate {{were made by}} many parties, but all failed when the masters refused to accept any compromise.Eventually the masters realised <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not negotiate, their only options would be to suspend or close their businesses, thus delaying contracts and facing at the best losing the orders and at the worst contractual penalties.|$|R

6000|$|... "The only {{consolation}} one has," [...] said Berners, [...] "is, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> turn us out, Lady Deloraine and Lady St Julians must quarrel, {{for they}} both {{want the same}} thing." ...|$|E
60|$|To this I answer, by no {{compulsion}} (though {{that might}} be performed too), but altogether voluntary; only with this argument to move it, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not continue their payments, they lose the benefit of their past contributions.|$|E
50|$|At {{the start}} of the fourth season, the Shadows were still {{recovering}} from the destruction of their capital city. The alliance made by Sheridan had started to fall apart. Many governments felt <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> nothing the Shadows would leave them alone. During this time, Delenn began to organize a large Anla'Shok attack on Z'ha'dum.|$|R
60|$|Some {{will have}} it, that the Slaughter and Destruction among the Fleet, is a Judgment upon them, for {{going into the}} Streights, and coming home again without doing any business; but those forget, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> all <b>they</b> were ordered to do, the Fault lies in those who sent them, and not in they that went.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is why {{the peasants}} are so ready to give," [...] one said. [...] "I don't {{say that they are}} not sorry for us, but the real reason is <b>they</b> know <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not give we should take, and instead of being {{harmless}} wanderers, as they call us, we should be driven to become bandits." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Indians {{are going}} to make an attack. The Miamis are up in arms. Pontiac has told them <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not destroy the forts and trading-posts the English will soon wipe them {{from the face of the}} earth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am a reformer; I {{desire to}} see {{sweeping}} changes; I want a good, wise, and honest government; and I desire these things because I fear <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not come peacefully they will come in a tempest of lawlessness and vengeance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Heart" [...] was {{intended}} for a much longer tale, and is unavoidably incomplete; but it is unnecessary to point out defects that even the juvenile reader will soon detect.

60|$|When I showed {{myself to}} the two hostages, {{it was with the}} captain, who told them I was the person the {{governor}} had ordered to look after them: and that it was the governor's pleasure they should not stir any where but by my direction; <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> <b>they</b> would be fetched into the castle, and be laid in irons: so that as we never suffered them to see me as a governor, I now appeared as another person, and spoke of the governor, the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon all occasions.|$|R
50|$|Correa {{announced}} that on Monday 26 July 2010 Ecuador would enact reforms to a hydrocarbons law {{that aims to}} expropriate foreign-company operations unless they sign service contracts increasing state control of the industry.
