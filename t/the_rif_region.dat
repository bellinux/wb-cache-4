Nepetoideae with 17 genera is the richest subfamily; Ajugoideae (Ajuga genus), Teucrioideae (Teucrium genus) and Scutellarioideae (Scutellaria genus) are monogenerics.

2500|$|Just as Moroccan {{women were}} subject to a gendered form of colonialism, their {{resistance}} was gendered as well. The oral traditions of Moroccan women were a unique form of disseminating stories of resistance, oftentimes inspired by existing Islamic oral traditions of female warriors who fought in early Islamic history, such as the stories of Hind and Sukayna. [...] Moroccan women, especially {{those involved in the}} armed resistance primarily in <b>the</b> northern <b>Rif</b> <b>region,</b> adopted their own experiences of fighting against colonialism to existing frameworks of oral traditions that address women in war.

40|$|Mutations in <b>the</b> rifampin resistance-determining (<b>Rif)</b> <b>regions</b> of <b>the</b> rpoB gene of Staphylococcus aureus mutants {{obtained}} during {{therapy or}} in vitro {{were analyzed by}} gene amplification and sequencing. Each of the resistant clinical isolates, including five nonrelated clones and two strains isolated from the same patient, and of the 10 in vitro mutants had a single base pair change that resulted in an amino acid substitution in the β subunit of RNA polymerase. Eight mutational changes at seven positions were found in cluster I of <b>the</b> central <b>Rif</b> <b>region.</b> Certain substitutions (His 481 /Tyr and Asp 471 /Tyr [S. aureus coordinates]) were present in several mutants. Substitutions Gln 468 /Arg, His 481 /Tyr, and Arg 484 /His, which conferred high-level rifampin resistance, were identical or in the same codon as those described in other bacterial genera, whereas Asp 550 /Gly has not been reported previously. Substitutions at codon 477 conferred high- or low-level resistance, depending {{on the nature of}} the new amino acid. The levels of resistance of in vivo and one-step in vitro mutants carrying identical mutations were similar, suggesting that no other resistance mechanism was present in the clinical isolates. On the basis of these data and the population distribution of more than 4, 000 clinical S. aureus isolates, we propose ≤ 0. 5 and ≥ 8 μg/ml as new breakpoints for the clinical categorization of this species relative to rifampin...|$|R
40|$|The {{exodus of}} Amazigh people from <b>the</b> Moroccan <b>Rif</b> <b>region</b> and their {{settlement}} in Europe began five decades ago. Since then, {{the notion of}} migration is constitutive to their subjectivity. Imazighen perceptions of migration are usually ambivalent and problematic. Although parts of the Amazigh community tend to identify migration {{as a threat to}} their cultural identity and memory, there other parts consider it a journey or a process during which the identity of an Amazigh migrant is partially re-constituted. This thesis deals explicitly with this tension. Diasporic Imazighen are now trying to articulate their identity in this uncertain condition. In view of the contemporary uncertainty, I question the roles Amazigh media play in highlighting and assisting the construction and re-articulation of identities that concern the situations in which many Imazighen live...|$|R
