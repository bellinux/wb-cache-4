5000|$|Rum-running, or bootlegging, is {{the illegal}} {{business}} of transporting (smuggling) alcoholic beverages where such transportation is forbidden by law. Smuggling is usually done to circumvent taxation or prohibition laws {{within a particular}} jurisdiction. The term rum-running is more commonly applied <b>to</b> <b>smuggling</b> over water; bootlegging is applied <b>to</b> <b>smuggling</b> over land. According to the PBS documentary Prohibition, the term [...] "bootlegging" [...] was popularized when thousands of city dwellers would sell liquor from flasks they kept in their boot leg all across major cities and rural areas. The term [...] "rum-running" [...] most likely originated {{at the start of}} Prohibition in the United States (1920-1933), when ships from Bimini in the western Bahamas transported cheap Caribbean rum to Florida speakeasies. But rum's cheapness made it a low-profit item for the rum-runners, and they soon moved on <b>to</b> <b>smuggling</b> Canadian whisky, French champagne, and English gin to major cities like New York City and Boston, where prices ran high. It was said that some ships carried $200,000 in contraband in a single run.|$|R
