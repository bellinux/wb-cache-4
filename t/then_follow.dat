5|$|Big Brother, the American {{version of}} the {{worldwide}} television show, features contestants (called houseguests) that compete against each other {{to be the last}} Big Brother house resident and win $500,000. The series first aired in 2000, and nineteen seasons have been completed as of September 2017. Big Brother contestants are chosen by the show's producers through an application process that includes a videotape submission, semi-final interviews at select cities, and a final interview in Los Angeles. Contestants are also recruited through various means but <b>then</b> <b>follow</b> the same subsequent interview process in order to appear on the show.|$|E

5|$|For {{the primary}} deposits, the source pegmatites, {{which are usually}} {{obtained}} by mining, are divided into small parts and then undergo flotation. Alkaline earth metal carbonates may be removed after reaction with hydrogen chloride; <b>then</b> <b>follow</b> thickening, filtration, and calcination. The result is a concentrate with rare-earth content of up to 90%. Secondary materials (such as coastal sands) undergo gravity separation. Magnetic separation follows, {{with a series of}} magnets of increasing strength. Monazite obtained by this method can be as pure as 98%.|$|E
5|$|Once in Petoskey, US31 intersects the {{northern}} end of US131 (Spring Street) and turns northward along Spring Street through downtown. The highway curves around to follow Mitchell Street to cross the Bear River and <b>then</b> <b>follow</b> Bay View Road. US31 runs along the Little Traverse Bay through the eastern end of Petoskey and into Bay View. From there, it intersects the southern end of M-119 and passes through a pair of small towns, Conway and Oden, that border inland lakes like Round Lake and various bays of Crooked Lake.|$|E
5|$|The Czerkases {{contacted}} paleontologist Phil Currie, who {{contacted the}} National Geographic Society.

Orange Line service travels along {{the entirety of the}} K Route (from the terminus at Vienna/Fairfax-GMU to the C & K junction just south of Rosslyn), part of the C Route (from the C & K junction just south of Rosslyn to Metro Center), and the entire D Route (from Metro Center to New Carrollton).|$|E
5|$|The fourth match pitted Judas Mesias, who was {{accompanied}} by Father James Mitchell, against Abyss. Abyss attempted to use a steel chair wrapped in barbed wire during the bout, but was stopped and it was taken away by the referee. Near the end, Abyss performed his signature Black Hole Slam maneuver on Mesias, however Mitchell distracted the referee from counting the pinfall. This allowed Mesias to spray red mist in Abyss' face and <b>then</b> <b>follow</b> by slamming Abyss face-first into the steel chair wrapped in barb-wire with his signature Straight to Hell maneuver at eleven minutes and three seconds.|$|E
5|$|The two <b>then</b> <b>follow</b> a small {{path through}} the woods until they come to {{a house with a}} stake fence around it. The house is {{described}} as beautiful, featuring carvings filled with gold and silver. They enter the house with a few men, and find that it is lit from glass windows in the ceiling, so that the daylight illuminates the room and there are no shadows to be seen due to this. There were depictions of many gods there and a woman who is described as well dressed near the door.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} scenes <b>then</b> <b>follow</b> whose exact {{sequence}} is unclear. Odd goes {{to visit his}} mother at the retirement home, which only makes him more unhappy: his mother is senile and spends her days staring emptily out the window, and the visit reminds him of his own impending old age. While Odd is at a restaurant, police come in and arrest the cook. At the shop where he normally buys his pipe tobacco, he learns that the owner has died. He decides to sell his boat, leading to misadventures when the buyer, who works at an airport, asks Odd to meet him there inside the secure zone. Odd goes to the local swimming pool, but his shoes were removed when the facility closed; as he is leaving, he finds a pair of red high-heeled boots and walks away in them.|$|E
5|$|During the German {{occupation}} of Norway {{as part of}} the Second World War, the Wehrmacht wanted a railway route past Trondheim which was guarded against sabotage. They decided {{that the best way to}} do this was to build a tunnel under the neighborhood of Tyholt. However, construction of the tunnel took much longer than expected, so instead Wehrmach started laying railway tracks in the streets in Trondheim. They planned that the railway would branch from the Dovre Line at Skansen Station and <b>then</b> <b>follow</b> Sandgata and Olav Tryggvasons gate, cross Nidelva on Bakke Bridge and then run up Innherredsveien before reaching the Meråker Line at Lademoen Station. However, by German capitulation on 8 May 1945, construction of the railway had only reached Søndre gate.|$|E
5|$|In Altranstädt, Marlborough {{reportedly}} approached Carl Piper, {{the most}} favored of the King's advisers of the time. Allegedly, he offered Piper a pension {{in exchange for}} advising Charles XII to invade Russia, as this would distract Charles from interfering in the War of the Spanish Succession. Carl Piper was openly accused of having accepted Marlborough's bribe, persuaded Charles to the Swedish invasion of Russia, which consequently lead to the disastrous Battle of Poltava. Carl Piper denied having accepted Marlborough's offer, but he did admit that he had accepted that Marlborough provided his wife Christina Piper {{with a pair of}} valuable earrings, which she admitted, and as it was the habit of Carl Piper to personally refuse bribes but allow his wife to accept them and <b>then</b> <b>follow</b> her recommendation, the accusation of Marlborough's bribe is not unlikely.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, American general Stephen Van Rensselaer III, a Federalist {{political}} appointee, {{in command}} of a sizable army near Lewiston, was pressured by the American president to invade. Although Van Rensselaer had severe doubts {{about the quality of}} his troops, {{he had no choice but}} to attack. He was an inexperienced militia general, and not trusted by the majority of regular army troops. In the early morning of 13 October 1812, he attempted to cross the Niagara River, leading to the Battle of Queenston Heights. Despite heavy fire from British artillery, the first wave of Americans (under Captain John E. Wool) managed to land, and <b>then</b> <b>follow</b> a fishermen's path up to the heights. From this point, they attacked and routed the British artillery. Brock had arrived from nearby Fort George and moved up to the artillery battery to gain a better view only minutes before Wool attacked. He, his aides, and the gunners were forced to beat a hasty retreat, leading their horses down the steep slope.|$|E
5|$|The {{work is not}} a law code {{issued by}} King Henry, but a {{compilation}} of already extant legislation that was still current during his reign. It is not a comprehensive listing of all laws that were in force during the early 11th century. It begins with Henry's Charter of Liberties, which he issued after his coronation, {{and this is the}} only actual legal document reproduced in the Leges. Some discussions of juridical matters <b>then</b> <b>follow,</b> then a long treatment of ecclesiastical issues. The rest of the treatise is concerned with non-ecclesiastical subjects, including cases of injury, theft, murder, and feuds. Procedural topics are included, such as how summonses to court should be formed, what notices need to be made before judicial procedures, how adjournments should be handled, and other such concerns. There is no strong organizational framework to the entirety of the Leges, which leads the author to repeat subjects as well as treating some subjects less than adequately.|$|E
5|$|Urquhart {{formulated}} his {{withdrawal plan}} on the successful method {{used in the}} evacuation of Gallipoli during the First World War. The northernmost units would fall back first, moving through the more southerly groups who would <b>then</b> <b>follow</b> behind. The Glider Pilots would organise the routes {{to the river and}} the whole operation would be covered by an intense artillery barrage from XXX Corps. South of the river the evacuation was organised and staffed by men of the Royal Engineers of 43rd Division and Royal Canadian Engineers, using rafts and storm boats. In order to prevent the Germans from learning about the operation, the plan was not announced until the afternoon and some men (mainly wounded) would remain to lay covering fire through the night. Men were ordered to muffle their boots and weapons to help them bypass known German incursions into the perimeter. Some men took the opportunity to shave before withdrawing, providing quite a morale boost.|$|E

5|$|GJ 3634 {{is named}} for its {{location}} in the Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars; a later expansion of the original catalogue was compiled jointly by Gliese and Hartmut Jahreiß. The Third Catalogue, the most recent catalogue, was formed to tag all then-known stars within 25 parsecs of Earth (81.54 light years). GJ 3634 was first catalogued in 1987. The discoverers of GJ 3634 b worked through the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) at the European Southern Observatory's La Silla Observatory in Chile for over six years in search of planets that orbited low-mass red dwarfs. After the discoveries of eleven prior planets, the researchers changed their strategy to search for planets with extremely short orbits. They would first discover the system using the radial velocity method, in which an observed Doppler shift in the star's light would be measured and interpreted; and would <b>then</b> <b>follow</b> up with a search for transits, in which the planet crosses in front of and dims its star as seen from Earth. Radial velocity measurements would help determine the most efficient and time-effective means of observing potential planetary transits.|$|E
5|$|M-72 starts its trans-peninsular journey at M-22 in the {{community}} of Empire on the shores of Lake Michigan in the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. From there it runs easterly uphill through mixed farmland and forest to cross the base of the Leelanau Peninsula. As the highway approaches the city of Traverse City, the roadway runs downhill and weaves {{back and forth across the}} Leelanau– Grand Traverse county line. M-72 merges with M-22 to run concurrently in the section of Traverse City in Leelanau County and immediately cross the county line into Grand Traverse County. The two highways run along Grandview Parkway, a four-lane boulevard on the shore of the West Arm of Grand Traverse Bay. At the intersection of Grandview Parkway and Division Street, M-22 ends. US31/M-37 run north along Division Street and turn east onto Grandview Parkway to join M-72. These three highways stay merged in a triple concurrency along the length of Grandview Parkway and across the Boardman River along the bay, bypassing downtown. They <b>then</b> <b>follow</b> Front Street until reaching Garfield Avenue east of downtown. At Garfield, M-37 turns north to run up the Old Mission Peninsula which separates the west and east arms of Grand Traverse Bay. US31/M-72 continues east along the shores of the East Arm of Grand Traverse Bay and northward to a junction in Acme. M-72 turns east to cross rural eastern Grand Traverse County along rolling hills through the communities of Williamsburg and Barker Creek.|$|E
5|$|Other hunting traditions <b>then</b> <b>follow,</b> again {{rooted in}} religion. The warriors of the Kuru tribe in Africa commit a sacred act {{in which they}} copulate with the ground in belief that it will make the Earth fertile and produce animals for the hunt, and a stag hunt in France, rooted in ancient pagan beliefs of the Gauls, is blessed by a mass before the hunt takes place, during which the hunters and dogs chase and {{ultimately}} kill a fleeing stag. In a fox hunt, the Wild Fox Association sabotages the hunting efforts by serving wine laced with a laxative to the hunters and distracting the dogs with an Afghan bitch in heat. Their efforts are then connected to species conservation, and to exemplify that hunters are truly concerned in wildlife conservation, Argentine hunters capture an Andean condor to sell to a zoo. A collage of other conservation efforts is shown, including the tagging of white rhinoceroses, grizzly bears and elephants, which are shot with morphine darts. Argentinian deer and elephant seals are physically subdued and marked. Tourists on Africans safaris then come to view the conservation efforts, which the narrator claims to have seemingly negated the animals' violent instincts. This deception is demonstrated with the mauling of a tourist named Pit Dernitz by lions.|$|E
