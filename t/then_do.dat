5|$|The {{brothers}} often competed {{together in}} various promotions; in the Eastern Sports Association (ESA), which Jean-Louis (Rudy) owned, they scripted the feuds {{so that the}} four brothers often faced a common opponent. A heel (villain) wrestler would face Rudy and emerge victorious {{from a series of}} matches; they would <b>then</b> <b>do</b> the same with Bobby and then Leo before facing The Beast.

Gran hates the family {{so much that she}} wants them to {{disappear}} as they <b>then</b> <b>do.</b> She's stuck in the hotel until the Doctor appears in a lift. Russell T Davies thought of this idea to pick for a potential Christmas Special for 2009 to give to Phil Ford to write. Phil decided to use some aliens in the plot he was given and a chase down Buckingham Palace. But Russell decided that the better choice was 'Christmas on Mars' which then became The Waters of Mars.|$|E

5|$|The gods <b>then</b> <b>do</b> {{battle with}} the invaders: Odin is {{swallowed}} whole and alive fighting the wolf Fenrir, causing his wife Frigg her second great sorrow (the first being {{the death of her}} son, the god Baldr). Odin's son Víðarr avenges his father by rending Fenrir's jaws apart and stabbing it in the heart with his spear, thus killing the wolf. The serpent Jörmungandr opens its gaping maw, yawning widely in the air, and is met in combat by Thor. Thor, also a son of Odin and described here as protector of the earth, furiously fights the serpent, defeating it, but Thor is only able to take nine steps afterward before collapsing. The god Freyr fights Surtr and loses. After this, people flee their homes, and the sun becomes black while the earth sinks into the sea, the stars vanish, steam rises, and flames touch the heavens.|$|E

25|$|Woman with a Horse was {{conceived}} {{in such a}} way that the viewer is obliged to contemplate the manifold surface of the painting for an extended period of time, piecing together the recognizable forms, not just in space, but in time; due to the temporal evolution resulting from the act of moving around the subject (during the painting process). Only <b>then</b> <b>do</b> the more obscure structures become legible with the topological context of the multi-dimension space of the whole. The radical new concept based on non-conventional precepts of space and time transformed the canvas from something quasi-static to something that possessed dynamic evolutionary characteristics. No longer governed by Euclidean geometry (or classical Renaissance perspective), Metzinger's Woman with a Horse is composed of a series of ellipses, curvilinear and rectilinear structures and planes juxtaposed and distributed throughout the canvas in complex myriad combinations of abstract volumetric forms that suggest rather than define the underlying subject.|$|E
25|$|Between {{the first}} and second lines, the ten-thousands-column will contain either one or two digits: the hundreds-digit of the hundreds-column and (possibly) the thousands-digit of the tens-column. Find the sum of these digits (if the one in the tens-row is missing {{think of it as a}} 0), and if there is a carry-digit from the thousands-column (written in {{superscript}} under the second line in the ten-thousands-column) then add this carry-digit as well. If the resulting sum has one digit then write it down under the second line in the ten-thousands-column; if it has two digits then write the last digit down under the line in the ten-thousands-column, and carry the first digit over to the hundred-thousands-column, writing it as a superscript to the yet-unwritten hundred-thousands digit under the line. However, if the hundreds-row has no thousands-digit <b>then</b> <b>do</b> not write this carry-digit as a superscript, but in normal size, in the position of the hundred-thousands-digit under the second line, and the multiplication algorithm is over.|$|E
25|$|The 'red plan' {{targeted}} {{victims and}} detailed action {{to be taken}} against them. The scenario, as described by Max Coleman in A Crime Against Humanity: Analysing the Repression of the Apartheid State, was as follows:Step 1: A person or a target would be identified as an enemy of the State. A cell member would then be instructed to monitor the 'target'.Step 2: A project - i.e. the elimination of a target would be registered with the co-ordinator. The co-ordinator would then have the project authorised by the regional manager and the managing director.Step 3: The CCB member would <b>then</b> <b>do</b> a reconnaissance to study the target's movements with a view to eliminating him or her.Step 4: The operative would propose the most practical method to the managing director. If the director felt this method was efficient, he would sign the proposal at what was called an 'in-house' meeting. There adjustments could be made to the plan before it was approved. The budget would be considered and finance would be made available for the project. The finance would come from the budget the Defence Force allocated to CCB activities. Indications are that money was always paid in cash.Step 5: The co-ordinator would be requested to make available the necessary arms and ammunition such as limpet mines, poison and/or live ammunition or other logistical support such as transport, etc.Step 6: The project would be carried out and the target would be eliminated. To do this the cell member could engage the assistance of what were termed 'unconscious members'. These were essentially underworld criminals who would, for money, kill as instructed. These 'unconscious' members were never told of the motive or the SADF connection - a false motive was usually supplied.|$|E

500|$|Wark {{played as}} a central defender, midfielder and, occasionally, as a striker. Wark was an unusual player; {{he was able to}} play as a {{defensive}} midfielder yet break forward to score. According to former team-mate Terry Butcher, this was because his colleagues would drop back to cover for him: [...] "I played with John Wark, who was a sitting midfielder but was one of the top scorers in England and Europe. If you see it, <b>then</b> <b>do</b> it, as long as the others spot it and cover for you." ...|$|E
500|$|The first commandment, {{according}} to Church teaching, [...] "means that [...] must worship and adore God alone because God is alone." [...] The Catechism explains that this prohibits idolatry, providing examples of forbidden {{practices such as}} the worship of any creature, and of demons... power, pleasure, race, ancestors, the state [...] money. Augustine interpreted this commandment as [...] "Love God and <b>then</b> <b>do</b> what you will". Explaining this sentiment, Kreeft states that all sin [...] "serves some other god, obeys another commander: the world or the flesh or the devil", if God truly be loved then one will do what God wills.|$|E

[...] "In the Depths of a Coal Mine", a story with pictures by Linson, was syndicated by McClure's {{in a number of}} newspapers, heavily edited. [...] Crane was reportedly disgusted by the cuts, asking Linson: [...] "Why the hell did they send me up there <b>then?</b> <b>Do</b> they want the public to think the coal mines gilded ball-rooms with the miners eating ice-cream in boiled shirt-fronts?" ...|$|E

I was just gonna stew on it, and <b>then</b> <b>do</b> it. That's {{the good thing about}} festivals. No need for me to sell anything here. Get in, rock out, get paid, get out. There are just going to be a few shows. Festival-type thingies. Perhaps the odd 'warm up gig' in someone's hair salon or something. Money was a motivating factor (resurfacing my indoor tennis court, oil change for my 4×4 Ferrari) but the idea of playing and hanging out with each other is something all of the guys are pretty stoked about." ...|$|E
500|$|Wolfenstein: The New Order {{makes use}} of an {{original}} score that reflects the alternative universe depicted in the game. [...] "We wanted to identify with different sounds that were kind of iconic, 1960s sounds, and <b>then</b> <b>do</b> our own twist on {{them to make a}} sound authentic enough that it felt realistic," [...] said Hines. The team placed a high importance on the game's music. During the game's development, composer Mick Gordon traveled to Sweden to meet with the team, and he spotted the game over three days, partly collaborating with both Fredrik Thordendal and Richard Devine. Gordon expressed the difference in composing the soundtrack for Wolfenstein: The New Order compared to other games: [...] "Usually you sign onto a project and then you're given a list of 150 battle cues to do." ...|$|E
500|$|Nirvana used dynamic shifts {{that went}} from quiet to loud. Cobain {{had sought to}} mix heavy and pop musical sounds; he commented, [...] "I wanted to be totally Led Zeppelin in a way and then be totally extreme punk rock and <b>then</b> <b>do</b> real wimpy pop songs". When Cobain heard the Pixies' 1988 album Surfer Rosa after {{recording}} Bleach, he felt it had the sound he wanted to achieve but until then was too intimidated to try. The Pixies' subsequent popularity encouraged Cobain to follow his instincts as a songwriter. Like the Pixies, Nirvana moved between [...] "spare bass-and-drum grooves and shrill bursts of screaming guitar and vocals". Near {{the end of his}} life, Cobain noted the band had become bored by the formula, finding it limited, but he expressed doubts that the band was skilled enough to try other dynamics.|$|E

The [...] "dynamic duo take a saber saw to a glistening new Maybach {{and turn it}} into a tricked-out 'Thunderdome' cruiser, <b>then</b> <b>do</b> doughnuts in a parking lot with a gaggle of models packed in the back." [...] The video [...] "eschews the narrative spazzouts and stoner-boggling tricks of previous Jonze videos" [...] preferring instead to [...] "luxuriate in the icon status of its two principals. We get fireworks, fist bumps, a fast car, and general larger-than-life camaraderie rather than, say, guys on fire running in slow-motion. It's like The Expendables, if that movie only starred two guys, and both of them were rappers who didn't do any onscreen fighting." [...] The car was put up for auction, and the proceeds donated toward the East African Drought Disaster.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Streep lobbied to {{play the}} lead role in Oliver Stone's {{adaption}} of the play Evita, but two months before filming was due to commence, she dropped out, citing [...] "exhaustion" [...] initially, although it was later revealed {{that there was a}} dispute over her salary. By the end of the decade, Streep actively looked to star in a comedy. She found the role in She-Devil (1989), a satire that parodied Hollywood's obsession with beauty and cosmetic surgery, in which she played a glamorous writer. Though not a success, Richard Corliss of Time wrote that Streep was the [...] "one reason" [...] to see the film and observed that it marked a departure from the dramatic roles she was known to play. Reacting to her string of poorly received films, Streep said: [...] "Audiences are shrinking; as the marketing strategy defines more and more narrowly who they want to reach—males from 16 to 25—it's become a chicken-and-egg syndrome. Which came first? First they release all these summer movies, <b>then</b> <b>do</b> a demographic survey of who's going to see them".|$|E
500|$|The {{mayor of}} Rajneeshpuram, David Berry Knapp (known as Swami Krishna Deva or KD), turned state's {{evidence}} and gave {{an account of}} {{his knowledge of the}} Salmonella attack to the FBI. He claimed that Sheela said [...] "she had talked with [...] about the plot to decrease voter turnout in The Dalles by making people sick. Sheela said that [...] commented that it was best not to hurt people, but if a few died not to worry." [...] In Miller's , this statement is attributed to Sheela: According to KD's testimony, she played doubters a tape of Rajneesh's muffled voice saying, [...] "if it was necessary to do things to preserve [...] vision, <b>then</b> <b>do</b> it," [...] and interpreted this to mean that murder in his name was fine, telling doubters [...] "not to worry" [...] if a few people had to die. The investigation uncovered a September 25, 1984, invoice from the American Type Culture Collection of microbes, showing an order received by the Rajneeshpuram laboratory for Salmonella typhi, the bacterium that causes the life-threatening illness typhoid fever.|$|E
