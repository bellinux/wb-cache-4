5|$|The Ayyubid sultan, Al-Adil I, stormed {{into the}} County of Tripoli, {{creating}} {{an opportunity for}} Leo to plunder <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>around</b> Antioch in 1208. Bohemond persuaded Kaykaus I, Sultan of Rum, to invade Cilicia, forcing Leo to withdraw from Antioch. Pope Innocent tasked Albert Avogadro, Patriarch of Jerusalem, to mediate a peace. Avogadro, who was an ally of the Knights Templar, urged Leo to return Bagras to them. In an attempt to renew the truce, Leo obeyed the legate's demand, promising to withdraw from Bagras.|$|E
5|$|The Chronister dig site {{is located}} atop the Ripley Formation. <b>The</b> <b>land</b> <b>around</b> the Chronister home and dig site sits atop {{sandstone}} from the Lower Ordovician Period or Canadian Epoch. It {{is located in}} a section of the Ozarks affected by erosion and filled with chert and sandstone debris. In addition, the region has been impacted by frequent faulting, leading to the combination of rocks from different geologic periods. As a result, it is difficult to create an accurate geologic map of the area.|$|E

5|$|The O-Bahn {{has caused}} a {{clustering}} of commercial and community development near the Tea Tree Plaza Interchange, as service-providing organisations and businesses have sought to exploit the area's easy accessibility to public transport and the city centre.

5|$|Bellaire's {{population}} had reached 1,124 in 1940. After 1940, Bellaire had a rapid population {{explosion in the}} post-World War II building boom. On December 31, 1948, the city of Houston had annexed <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>around</b> the city of Bellaire, stopping the city of Bellaire's land growth. Bellaire remained independent of Houston; Bellaire adopted a home rule charter with a council-manager government in April 1949. By 1950 the city's residents had numbered 10,173, and there were 3,186 houses. However each subsequent {{year for the next}} two years, an additional 600 to 700 new houses opened. Due to the resulting population increase, several schools, including Bellaire High School, Marion High School, and two elementary schools, were established in that period, and Condit Elementary received a new addition. In the 1960s 250 houses in Bellaire were demolished {{to make way for the}} right of way of the 610 Loop, which bisected the city.|$|E
5|$|From {{the initial}} {{planning}} stages, proponents and opponents {{speculated that the}} large size of the reservoir created by the dam could affect the weather in Interior Alaska and the Yukon. Several studies were conducted in regards to these potential changes, {{and most of the}} reports hypothesized an effect similar to the weather that occurs around Great Slave Lake and Lake Baikal, both of which were of similar sizes and latitudes to the proposed reservoir. Forecasts predicted the lake would hold in heat longer during the autumn, thus keeping area temperatures slightly warmer than normal. In the spring, however, the area around the lake would have been prone to increased precipitation due to the phenomenon of lake-effect snow. In the summer, the long periods of daylight would have caused <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>around</b> the lake to become warmer than the lake itself, also creating the possibility of storms.|$|E
5|$|Ganoga Lake {{is on the}} Allegheny Plateau, {{just north}} of the Allegheny Front, which is the {{boundary}} between the dissected plateau to the north and the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians to the south. Kitchen Creek, which drains the lake, drops approximately 1,000feet (300m) in 2.25miles (3.62km) as it flows down the steep escarpment of the Allegheny Front. About 300to 250million years ago, the Allegheny Plateau, Allegheny Front, and Appalachian Mountains all formed in the Alleghenian orogeny. This happened long after the sedimentary rocks at the lake were deposited, when the part of Gondwana that became Africa collided with what became North America, forming Pangaea. In the years since, up to 5,000feet (1,500m) of rock has been eroded away by streams and weather. At least three major glaciations in the past million years have been the final factor in shaping <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>around</b> the lake today.|$|E

5|$|In 1448 and 1451, {{there was}} {{a change in the}} Byzantine and Ottoman leaderships, respectively. Murad II died and was succeeded by Mehmed the Conqueror whilst Constantine XI Palaiologos succeeded John VIII. Constantine XI and Mehmed did not get along well; the former's {{successful}} conquests of Crusader territory in the Peloponnese alarmed the latter, who had since subjugated as vassals the crusaders in the region, and Mehmed had around 40,000 soldiers sent to nullify these gains. Constantine XI threatened to rebel against Mehmed unless certain conditions were met by the Sultan regarding the status quo. Mehmed responded to these threats by building fortifications in the Bosporus and thus closed Constantinople from outside naval assistance. The Ottomans already controlled <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>around</b> Constantinople and so they began an assault on the city on 6 April 1453. Despite a union of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches, the Byzantines received no official aid from the Pope or Western Europe, {{with the exception of a}} few soldiers from Venice and Genoa.|$|E
5|$|In the 21st century, {{the castle}} remains {{owned by the}} National Trust and is managed by English Heritage. The site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and the ruins are {{protected}} under UK law as a Grade I listed building. It lies within the Northumberland Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and {{is part of a}} Site of Special Scientific Interest, with parts of the site comprising a Special Protection Area for the conservation of wild birds. The National Trust has encouraged <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>around</b> the outside of the castle to remain waterlogged to enable the conservation of amphibians and bird species, and the inside of the castle is protected from grazing animals to encourage nesting birds.|$|E
5|$|It {{continues}} south through {{blocks of}} small-scale dense urban development to 14th Street. Glenwood Springs High School {{is on the}} west just past the intersection heralds the end of downtown. For two blocks <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>around</b> the road becomes a commercial strip with large parking lots. At Hyland Park on the east just afterwards, the land across the road is devoted to larger houses on larger lots. Strip development resumes {{on the west side}} south of 19th Street, two blocks west of Valley View Hospital. At 23rd Street, Highway 82 turns southeast to follow South Glen Avenue, paralleling the adjacent Rio Grande rail trail. Development along the highway becomes predominantly commercial, and south of 27th Street a continuous strip begins on the east side as the valley narrows. After passing Rosebud Cemetery on the west side, Highway 82 turns more to the southeast and draws alongside the Roaring Fork as it reaches the city limits.|$|E
50|$|From 1640 onwards, {{the native}} Irish were subdued {{in a series}} of confrontations, leading to greater {{agricultural}} use of <b>the</b> <b>lands.</b> <b>Around</b> this time, Shankill was absorbed into the parish of Rathmichael.|$|R

5|$|Neither Burch nor Smith {{had owned}} the cave or <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>around</b> it, which {{belonged to the}} public. Beginning in the 1890s, the Federal {{government}} began regulating {{the use of public}} lands like these. In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt designated millions of acres of forest lands for protection, including what became Siskiyou National Forest, which surrounds the cave. The USFS was created in 1905 to manage these reserves. Three years later, Congress passed the Antiquities Act, which allowed the President to designate protected areas called National Monuments on public lands. In 1909, President William Howard Taft established Oregon Caves National Monument, to be managed by the USFS. A year later the USFS employed men to guard the cave and to serve as tour guides.|$|E
5|$|The {{only part}} of the region that is {{predominantly}} given over to crops is <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>around</b> the Humber estuary, where the well-drained fens result in excellent quality land. The lowland Cheshire Plain is mostly given over to dairy farming, while in the Pennines and Cheviots grazing sheep play an important role not just in agriculture but also in land management more generally. Heather moorland in the Pennine uplands is home to driven grouse shooting from 12 August (the Glorious Twelfth) until 10 December every year. In the twentieth century, numbers of red grouse and black grouse in the area fell significantly, but improved gamekeeping practices have resulted in both species making a comeback in the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlements}} of Hale and Hale Barns {{are closely}} linked; what {{would later become}} Hale Barns {{spent most of the}} medieval period {{as an extension of the}} more dominant Hale. During this era <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>around</b> Hale and Hale Barns was used agriculturally because although the soil is poor draining, it is fertile. By the middle of the 15th century Hale Barns had established an identity completely separate from neighbouring Hale as demonstrated by the tithe barn which was established around this time. The tithe barn was for storing the tithes – a tenth of the farm's produce which was to be given to the church. Such an establishment can be seen as a sign of the area's prosperity. The original barn no longer survives but there is a drawing of it (from 1844). It is the source of the village's name. The first explicit reference to the village of Hale Barns– rather than Hale– is in a document from 1616.|$|E
