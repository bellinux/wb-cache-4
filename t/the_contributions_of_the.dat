5|$|At {{the time}} both South African and South American plants {{were placed in}} this same genus. By {{the early nineteenth century}} Amaryllis had become a {{polymorphic}} (diverse) genus with about 50 species from what we would consider a dozen genera today, and attempts were made to separate it into different genera. This work commenced in 1819 with <b>the</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English botanist, the Revd. William Herbert in Curtis's Botanical Magazine which he expanded in 1821 in The Botanical Register, identifying 14 species of the new genus of Hippeastrum, and only leaving three species in Amaryllis. The rest of the Amaryllis species he transferred to other genera, several of which he created. Herbert further refined his descriptions of Hippeastrum in his work on the Amaryllidaceae in 1837.|$|E

30|$|From Table 1, the {{scattered}} power {{received in the}} specular zone mostly comes from <b>the</b> flatter parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall, 50 % in <b>the</b> presented case. <b>The</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smaller details is almost negligible in this zone, about 4 %. However, in <b>the</b> non-specular zone, <b>the</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> small details increases, reaching 12 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total MP scattered power, while <b>the</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flat parts decreases. Also noticeable is <b>the</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intermediate details, columns 2 and 3, which increases in the non-specular zone compared to the specular zone.

5|$|English Mayanist J. Eric S. Thompson cast strong doubts {{upon the}} {{authenticity}} of the Grolier Codex in his 1975 article The Grolier Codex, published in volume 27 of <b>the</b> <b>Contributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University of California. Thompson argued that the codex was a modern forgery and that the unusual mix of styles in the document was not due to the mixing of cultures but rather due to the hand of a forger. Thompson queried the illustration of all four stations of Venus in the codex, noting that other Mesoamerican codices only illustrated the more spectacular appearance of Venus as morning star. This claim has been refuted more recently, with evidence presented from the Codex Telleriano-Remensis that the god of the morning star also presided over the evening star. The contents of the document have not been copied directly from any of the generally accepted Maya codices, although they do resemble pages 46 to 50 of the Dresden Codex.|$|E
5|$|From his {{headquarters}} in Tampa, Schwarzkopf began planning the operations to defend Saudi Arabia. Lieutenant General Charles Horner, USAF, ran the headquarters in Riyadh. Schwarzkopf planned supply lines for the 50,000 troops initially sent to Saudi Arabia, tapping Major General William G. Pagonis {{as director of}} the logistical operations, with U.S. Air Force cargo aircraft landing supplies at Dhahran and U.S. Navy ships offloading troops and supplies at Dammam. By August 20, 20,000 U.S. troops were in Saudi Arabia, with another 80,000 preparing to deploy, and a further 40,000 reserves tapped to augment them. Schwarzkopf arrived at the CENTCOM command in Riyadh on August 25, and on August 29 he conducted his first front-line tour of the potential combat zone, accompanied by reporters. Over the next several weeks, Schwarzkopf spoke frequently with both reporters and troops under his command, conducting many high-profile press conferences and updates to the situation in Saudi Arabia. Schwarzkopf worked to help coordinate <b>the</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different nations contributing military forces to the effort. By mid-October, Schwarzkopf indicated he was confident the forces were of a sufficient level that they could defend Saudi Arabia if it was attacked. Through October, Schwarzkopf and his command were occupied with setting up facilities and supply lines for the troops streaming into Saudi Arabia. He also worked to minimize the culture clash among foreigners in sharia-dominated Saudi Arabia, such as the high visibility of women in military roles. Schwarzkopf remained at his command in Riyadh through December, making frequent frontline visits to the troops. On December 29, 1990, he received a warning order from The Pentagon to be ready to attack into Iraq and Kuwait by January 17.|$|E

40|$|We {{calculate}} expectation {{values of}} QCD operators consisting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> products <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four operators <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light quarks ¯qΓ X q¯qΓ Y q, with Γ X,Y {{corresponding to the}} scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, pseudovector (axial) and tensor Lorentz structures, in the nucleon. All combinations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light flavors are considered. For the evaluation we use elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Perturbative Chiral Quark Model (PCQM), approximating <b>the</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> valence quarks by <b>the</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PCQM constituent quarks. <b>The</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea quarks is treated by averaging over the QCD pions with <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pion field being determined by the PCQM.
