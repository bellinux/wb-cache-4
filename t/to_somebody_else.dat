5|$|In early , Koufax asked Dodgers GM Buzzie Bavasi {{to trade}} {{him because he}} wasn't getting enough playing time. By the end of 1960, after going 8–13, Koufax was {{thinking}} about quitting baseball to devote himself to an electronics business that he'd invested in. After the last game of the season, he threw his gloves and spikes into the trash. Nobe Kawano, the clubhouse supervisor, retrieved the equipment to return to Koufax the following year (or <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> if Koufax {{did not return to}} play).|$|E
5|$|In December 1483, Richard instituted what {{later became}} known as the Court of Requests, a court to which poor people who could not afford legal {{representation}} could apply for their grievances to be heard. He also improved bail in January 1484, to protect suspected felons from imprisonment before trial and to protect their property from seizure during that time. He founded the College of Arms in 1484, he banned restrictions on the printing and sale of books, and he ordered the translation of the written Laws and Statutes from the traditional French into English. He ended the arbitrary benevolences (a device by which Edward IV raised funds), made it punishable to conceal from a buyer of land that a part of the property had already been disposed of <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else,</b> required that land sales be published, laid down property qualifications for jurors, restricted the abusive Courts of Piepowders, regulated cloth sales, instituted certain forms of trade protectionism, prohibited the sale of wine and oil in fraudulent measure, and prohibited fraudulent collection of clergy dues, among others. Churchill implies he improved the law of trusts.|$|E

500|$|In July 2016, HBO head of {{programming}} Casey Bloys confirmed {{plans for a}} potential third season, stating, [...] "It is not dead. I talked to Nic about it and both Nic and HBO are open to another season. I don't think Nic has a take and he's working on some other projects.

[...] This came shortly after McConaughey said he would hypothetically be interested in reprising his role as Rust Cohle in a third season.
