Although Hamilton had been forming ideas {{of a national}} bank as early as 1779, he gathered ideas in various ways over the past eleven years. These included theories from Adam Smith, extensive studies on the Bank of England, the blunders of the Bank of North America and his experience in establishing the Bank of New York. He also used American records from James Wilson, Pelatiah Webster, Gouverneur Morris, and from his assistant Treasury secretary Tench Coxe.|$|E

A school of agriculture would teach about important topics such as crop rotation, the specific ways to work with each crop, methods of seeding and harvesting, preservation of seeds, and identification of pests. Until that time, the only previous attempts to teach agriculture was done by the Jesuits, who were banished in 1767.|$|E

A target of 243Am was bombarded by a beam of 22Ne ions. The scientists at Dubna reported 9.4MeV (with the reported half-life of 0.1–3 seconds) and 9.7MeV (t1/2>0.05s) alpha activities followed by alpha activities {{similar to those of}} either 256103 or 257103. The two activity lines were, based on prior theoretical predictions, assigned to 261105 and 260105, accordingly.|$|E
5|$|Carrion, fungi, fruits such as chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), {{and seeds}} are also eaten. Two grey jays were seen eating slime mold (Fuligo septica) near Kennedy Hot Springs in the Glacier Peak Wilderness, Washington. This was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>report</b> of any bird {{consuming}} slime mold in the field. Risk and energy expenditure are factors in food selection for the grey jay, which selects {{food on the}} basis of profitability to maximize caloric intake. Increased handling, searching, or recognition times for a preferred food item lowers its profitability. Grey jays wrench, twist, and tug food apart, unlike other birds known as jays (such as the blue jay, Cyanocitta cristata), which grasp and hammer their food. Grey jays commonly carry large food items to nearby trees to eat or process for storage, possibly as defense against large scavengers.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1842, the {{existing}} route became impassable, and Clifton undertook {{the creation of the}} proposed coastal route. He sent his company's men to clear the path and make a road. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>report</b> of the new road was on 19 October, praising the new route but deriding the almost impassable obstacles presented by the large rivers en route. The Australind–Mandurah route was completed by 2 November, and the speed of the new route allowed almost daily communication. It could be travelled in 32 hours, with a ferry to cross the estuary at Mandurah. The ferry was operated, and later owned, by nearby resident Mrs Lyttleton, as the government was not interested at that time in owning or leasing out the ferry. The government later appropriated the ferry on 2 February 1843, and imposed standardised tolls for passengers and livestock. Ten years later, the ferry service was made available to the public free of charge.|$|E

5|$|In 1816 in France, a physician, J. P. A. Pasquier, {{described}} {{an outbreak of}} typhoid linked to the consumption of raw oysters. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>report</b> of this kind in the United States was in Connecticut in 1894. As sewage treatment programmes became more prevalent in the late 19th century, more outbreaks took place. This may have been because sewage was released through outlets into the sea providing more food for bivalves in estuaries and coastal habitats. A causal link between the bivalves and the illness {{was not easy to}} demonstrate because the illness might come on days or even weeks after the ingestion of the contaminated shellfish. One viral pathogen is the Norwalk virus. This is resistant to treatment with chlorine-containing chemicals and may be present in the marine environment even when coliform bacteria have been killed by the treatment of sewage.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, a {{third major}} {{competitor}} joined {{the race for}} superheavy elements—the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (English: Society for Heavy Ion Research) in Darmstadt, Hesse, West Germany. They claimed to have synthesized the element 107; their report came out five years after <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>report</b> from Dubna did but provided a greater level of precision, making a more solid claim on discovery. The German team joined with the Soviet team in that it suggested the name nielsbohrium for the new element, believing Bohr did deserve an element named after him, and hoping to ease the tension on the element 105 controversy. The Soviet team did not hurry to suggest a new name for element 105, stating {{it was more important}} to first determine the discoverers of the element.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the Swiss {{scientist}} Albert Hofmann—known for {{the synthesis of}} the psychedelic drug LSD—chemically analyzed P.semilanceata fruit bodies collected in Switzerland and France by the botanist Roger Heim. Using the technique of paper chromatography, Hofmann confirmed the presence of 0.25% (by weight) psilocybin in dried samples. Their 1963 publication was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>report</b> of psilocybin in a European mushroom species; previously, it had been known only in Psilocybe species native to Mexico, Asia and North America. This finding was confirmed in the late 1960s with specimens from Scotland and England, Czechoslovakia (1973), Germany (1977), Norway (1978), and Belgium and Finland (1984). In 1965, forensic characterization of psilocybin-containing mushrooms seized from college students in British Columbia identified P.semilanceata—the first recorded case of intentional recreational use of the mushroom in Canada. The presence of the psilocybin analog baeocystin was confirmed in 1977. Several studies published since then {{support the idea that}} the variability of psilocybin content in P.semilanceata is low, regardless of country of origin.|$|E

By February 2007, large commercial migratory beekeepers wintering in California, Florida, Oklahoma, and Texas had reported heavy losses associated with CCD. Their reports of losses varied widely, ranging from 30% to 90% of their bee colonies; in some cases, beekeepers reported losses of nearly all of their colonies with surviving colonies so weakened that they might {{no longer be able to}} pollinate or produce honey.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{regularly}} tackled {{police misconduct}} issues, {{starting with the}} 1932 case Powell v. Alabama (right to an attorney), and including 1942's Betts v. Brady (right to an attorney), and 1951's Rochin v. California (involuntary stomach pumping). In the late 1940s, several ACLU local affiliates established permanent committees to address policing issues. During the 1950s and 1960s, the ACLU was responsible for substantially advancing the legal protections against police misconduct. The Philadelphia affiliate was responsible for causing the City of Philadelphia, in 1958, to create the nation's first civilian police review board. In 1959, the Illinois affiliate published <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>report</b> in the nation, Secret Detention by the Chicago Police, which documented unlawful detention by police.|$|E

5|$|The use of {{ultrasonography}} {{in medicine}} soon followed in different {{locations around the}} world. In the mid-1950s more research was undertaken by Professor Ian Donald et al., in Glasgow, which advanced the practical technology and applications of ultrasound. In 1963, in France, Léandre Pourcelot started on his thesis, which was presented in 1964, and used pulsed Doppler for blood flow calculation as its subject. This was followed up by Peronneau in 1969. Dr. Gene Strandness and the bio-engineering group at the University of Washington who conducted research on Doppler ultrasound as a diagnostic tool for vascular disease, published their first work in 1967. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>report</b> published about the venous system appeared around 1967–1968.|$|E

In 1966, Crandell and colleagues reported a series in which 17/95 (18%) of patients developed an unusual type of nephropathy after operations in which methoxyflurane was used as a general anesthetic. This particular type of renal insufficiency was characterized by vasopressin-resistant high-output renal failure (production of large volumes of poorly concentrated urine) with a negative fluid balance, pronounced weight loss, elevation of serum sodium, chloride, osmolality and blood urea nitrogen. The urine of these patients was of a relatively fixed specific gravity and an osmolality very {{similar to that of the}} serum. Furthermore, the high urine output persisted a challenge test of fluid deprivation. Most cases resolved within 2–3 weeks, but evidence of renal dysfunction persisted for more than one year in 3 of these 17 cases (18%), and more than two years in one case (6%).|$|E
