The {{aim of this study}} was to develop an in vitro model that is able to mimic the coronary circulation in such a way that coronary pressure and flow signals under baseline as well as hyperaemic conditions are approximated as realistically as possible and are in accordance with recently gained insights into such signals in conscious man. In the present in vitro model the heart, the systemic and coronary circulation are modelled on the basis of the elements of a lumped parameter mathematical model only consisting of elements that can be represented by segments in an experimental set-up. A collapsible <b>tube,</b> <b>collapsed</b> by the ventricular pressure, represents the variable resistance and volume behaviour of the endocardial part of the myocardium.

The implant saved Kaiba 2 ̆ 7 s life, and now he has the strong breathing of a healthy baby boy. This incredible story is an early example of a new clinical paradigm in biomedicine: 3 D bio-printing.

Case studies of incredible stories, such as Kaiba 2 ̆ 7 s, illustrate the impact that has already been made on real lives. Along the way we will answer questions such as: What is 3 D printing? How does it work? Is it really possible to print living cells? Can we print an organ? Could we print the human body?

40|$|Abstract — Circular tubes {{have been}} widely used as {{structural}} members in many engineering applications. Therefore, its collapse behavior has been studied for many decades, focusing on its energy absorption characteristics and collapse mechanism. In order to predict the <b>collapse</b> behavior of <b>tubes,</b> one could rely on the use of finite element codes or experiments. These tools provide results with high accuracy but costly and require extensive running time. Therefore, an approximated model of <b>tubes</b> <b>collapse</b> mechanism is an alternative especially for the early step of design. This paper is also aimed to develop a closed-form solution to predict the response of circular tube subjected to pure bending, focusing on the ovalisation regime. New ovalisation model was developed to include the effect of curvature into account. In order to compare, the experiment was conducted with a number of tubes having various D/t ratios. In addition, the available predictions from other investigators were also presented and compared. Good agreement was found between the theoretical predictions and experimental results.
