5|$|Perhaps {{the reason}} people rarely talk about his {{formidable}} attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood. Ease in any art {{is the result of}} mastery over the details of the craft. You get them together to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> can forget about how you do things and concentrate on what you are doing. Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it — but happily so.|$|E
500|$|According to Amy Lee, [...] "Going Under" [...] {{is about}} a {{previous}} emotionally [...] and physically damaging relationship: [...] "And when you're {{at the end of}} your rope, when you're at <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> realize something has to change, that you can't go on living in the situation that you're in. It's cool. It's a very strong song." [...] "Going Under" [...] was Fallen second single. [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] is a nu metal-rap rock song written in common time and performed at a moderate tempo (96 beats per minute). Written by Lee, Ben Moody, and David Hodges, the song was conceived when an acquaintance asked Lee in a restaurant if she was happy in her current relationship. When Lee realized that she was not, the lyrics [...] "wake me up inside" [...] were inspired. The singer confirmed that the song was about longtime friend Josh Hartzler, whom she married in 2007.|$|E

The lyrics are from the perspective of a soldier in the midst of First World War trench warfare. Several lines, including [...] "Give your leaders each a gun and then let them fight it out themselves" [...] and [...] "The next will be chemical but they will never learn", are adapted from quotations by Patch. Both Luke Lewis of NME and Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly likened the lyrics to Wilfred Owen's First World War-era poem Dulce et Decorum est. Rice referred to Yorke's voice in the song as an [...] "innocent and youthful falsetto"; the NME said his singing is [...] "subdued to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> really need to read the lyrics".|$|E

Rowling said [...] "the series is built around [...] ", and maintained that she always knew what Snape {{would turn out to be}} at the end and that she carefully plotted his storyline throughout the series. [...] "I had to drop clues all the way through because as you know in the seventh book when you have the revelation scene where everything shifts and you realise...what Snape's motivation was. I had to plot that through the books because at <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> see what was really going on, it would have been an absolute cheat on the reader at that point just to show a bunch of stuff you've never seen before."

Advice on how to make “native” friends circulates like an underground currency: “Move in with English-speaking flat-mates!” “Avoid co-ethnics!” “Watch footy and next day ask the person at the bus stop what they thought of that tackle. ” “Take up a sport, a hobby, a religion and join in. ” The list of what is and is not supposed to work is endless and so is the hidden sense of failure nourished by many whose English isn’t as good as they think it should be and who don’t have as many local friends as they think they should have. There is a facile assumption that language learning and making friends are connected in a virtuous cycle: English makes it easier to make friends, which in turn improves your language proficiency, which in turn allows you access to ever more widening networks {{and so on and so}} forth to <b>the</b> happy <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> speak perfect English and have a wide, dense and complex network of social contacts...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHave {{you ever}} {{wondered}} {{why a lot}} of students cannot continue mathematics when taught? Have you ever wondered why students get so frustrated when doing math? As we all know, this field is very detailed to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> if <b>you</b> are not careful any problem can have flaws. Could a person who lacks detail-orientation learn the discipline of mathematics? How does a person keep this area? There could be a lot of factors that play into the failure of retention in this area. Is there some mental block from learning science? Is there a learning disability in some students? Is the field of mathematics not their forte’? Are students intimidated by this field? There is a statement that students use all of the time which is, and I quote, “Mathematics is another language to me,” “Mathematics is scary looking”, and “I do not like mathematics because I do not understand it. ” Could it be that some professors are not teaching students correctly? Would it be that students are paying for what they have not paid attention to in grade school? How does a professor get a student who is not interested in math to become interested enough at least to learn the basics? I consider this field of infinite applications and must know where it applies in various areas. It seems that the mathematics is the branch of knowledge that a lot of students do not seem to grasp like the other fields. Why is this the case? As we discuss this matter in the article, we shall see what could be the reasons behind this hindrance...|$|R
5000|$|And yet, as {{annoying}} as {{this episode}} was in concept and generally in execution, it wasn’t that painful to actually watch.

Charlie Scene also explained that the third album will be released much sooner than American Tragedy was, and predicts it will be released by the summer of 2012. [...] "We have a bunch of songs written and we're writing more on the road. We brought some studio equipment with us so we've been able to work on stuff while we're touring. After this tour and we're back home, we'll be able to work with producers that we want to work with and dial all the stuff in that we have - skeletons of songs. We have some really good stuff that we're excited to work on for sure. One thing that we definitely don't want to do is take as long as it took for us to do 'American Tragedy' so there will definitely be a third record out next year and we're hoping for at the latest - summer."

There is less than nothing to complain of in the tea-room which enjoys our international favor except that at the most psychological moment of the afternoon you cannot get a table, in spite of the teas going on in the fashionable hotels and the friendly houses everywhere. The toast is exceptional; the muffins so far from home are at least reminiscent of their native island; the tea and butter are alike blameless. The company, to the eye of the friend of man, is still more acceptable, for, if the Americans have dwindled, the English have increased; and there is nothing more endearing than the sight of a roomful of English people at their afternoon tea in a strange land. No type seems to predominate; there are bohemians as obvious as clerics; there are old ladies and young, alike freshly fair; there are the white beards of age and the clean-shaven cheeks of youth among the men; some are fashionable and some outrageously not; peculiarities of all kinds abound without conflicting. Some talk, frankly audible, and others are frankly silent, but a deep, wide purr, tacit or explicit, close upon a muted hymn of thanksgiving, in that assemblage of mutually repellent personalities, for the nonce united, would best denote the universal content.|$|R
