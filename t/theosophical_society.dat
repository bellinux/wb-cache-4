5|$|In 1907, Besant {{became the}} {{president}} of the <b>Theosophical</b> <b>Society</b> globally, and set to work with a major expansion of the organisation's headquarters at Adyar, in what was then, Madras. When it was announced that Besant would undertake a speaking tour of Australia in 1908, she was expected to stay with Fuller while in Perth. Some months later in 1908, Fuller left Western Australia and travelled to India, staying at Adyar. Of her time in India, Fuller wrote:I went in search not only of beauty, and light, and colour, and the picturesqueness in general, which delight the eye and emotions of all artists—but of something deeper—something less easily expressed. I spent {{two and a half years}} in a community that is quite unique—perhaps the most cosmopolitan settlement in the world—the headquarters of the <b>Theosophical</b> <b>Society...</b> Well, I painted there, of course, but my art was undergoing a change, and I felt that it could not satisfy me unless it became so much greater.|$|E
5|$|During an 11-month {{period of}} {{blindness}} in 1902, List became increasingly interested in occultism, in particular coming {{under the influence}} of the <b>Theosophical</b> <b>Society,</b> resulting in an expansion of his Wotanic beliefs to incorporate Runology and the Armanen Futharkh. The popularity of his work among the völkisch and nationalist communities resulted in the establishment of a List Society in 1908; attracting significant middle and upper-class support, the Society published List's writings and included an Ariosophist inner group, the High Armanen Order, over whom List presided as Grand Master.|$|E

The society's most prominent figure was Annie Besant, who founded the Home Rule League in 1916. The Home Rule Movement was organised from Madras and found extensive support in the Province. Nationalistic newspapers such as The Hindu, the Swadesamitran and the Mathrubhumi actively endorsed the campaign for independence. India's first trade union was established in Madras in 1918 by V. Kalyanasundaram and B. P. Wadia.|$|E
5|$|Fortune {{was born}} in Llandudno, North Wales, to a wealthy upper middle-class English family, {{although}} little is known of her early life. By her teenage years {{she was living in}} England's West Country, where she wrote two books of poetry. After time spent at a horticultural college she began studying psychology and psychoanalysis at the University of London before working as a counsellor in a psychotherapy clinic. During the First World War she joined the Women's Land Army and established a company selling soy milk products. She became interested in esotericism through the teachings of the <b>Theosophical</b> <b>Society,</b> before joining an occult lodge led by Theodore Moriarty and then the Alpha et Omega occult organisation.|$|E
5|$|Conn Smythe {{was born}} on February 1, 1895, in Toronto to Albert Smythe, an Irish Protestant from County Antrim who immigrated to Canada in 1889, and Mary Adelaide Constantine, an English woman. Mary and Albert were married in the 1880s while immigrating to Canada. Albert and Mary had a rocky {{marriage}} and did not live together {{for more than a}} few months at a time. Mary, who was known as Polly, was remembered by Conn as pretty, a drinker and troublemaker, while Albert was quiet, a vegetarian and a devoted member of Madame Blavatsky's Theosophical movement. Albert Smythe was a charter member of the <b>Theosophical</b> <b>Society</b> of Canada in 1891, and edited its newsletter until the final years of his life.|$|E

5|$|Later {{claiming}} {{that she was}} acting under instruction from the Ascended Masters, Fortune and Loveday joined the Christian Mystic Lodge of the <b>Theosophical</b> <b>Society,</b> which was run by Daisy M. Grove. Fortune soon became its president, and under her leadership the group's membership expanded and the readership of its published Transactions also grew. Throughout this period, she foregrounded {{the need for a}} Christian perspective within the Theosophical movement, emphasising the centrality and importance of the 'Master Jesus' in her various articles. She publicly criticised another Theosophical group, the Liberal Catholic Church founded by J. I. Wedgwood and Charles Webster Leadbeater, alleging that it was not concerned with the Master Jesus and was instead preoccupied with the Master Maitreya. One of the prominent figures in the Church, Bishop Piggott, accused her of attributing false claims to him in The Occult Review.|$|E
5|$|To {{recover from}} her {{experience}} at Studley, Fortune began studying psychotherapy. Her initial interest {{was in the}} work of Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler, though she later moved on to that of Carl Jung. She studied psychology and psychoanalysis under John Flügel at the University of London, before gaining employment at a psychological clinic in London's Brunswick Square, which was likely run {{under the jurisdiction of the}} London School of Medicine for Women. Working as a counsellor from 1914 until 1916, most of those she dealt with were coming to terms with sexual urges that were considered taboo in British society. Through her affiliation with the Society for the Study of Orthopsychics, she gave a series of lectures that were later published in 1922 as The Machinery of the Mind. While working at the clinic, she developed her interest in esotericism by attending lunchtime lectures organised by the <b>Theosophical</b> <b>Society</b> and reading some of the organisation's literature. With her interest in occultism increasing, Fortune became increasingly dissatisfied with the effectiveness of psychotherapy.|$|E
5|$|Various esoteric {{organizations}} {{that emerged in}} the late 19th and early 20th centuries, such as the <b>Theosophical</b> <b>Society</b> and the Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis, repeated the beliefs that had originated with Sethos: that Egyptians underwent initiation within the pyramids and that Greek philosophers were initiates who learned Egypt's secret wisdom. Esoteric writers influenced by Theosophy, such as Reuben Swinburne Clymer in his 1909 book The Mystery of Osiris and Manly Palmer Hall in Freemasonry of the Ancient Egyptians in 1937, also wrote of an age-old Egyptian mystery tradition. An elaborate example of these beliefs is the 1954 book Stolen Legacy by George James, which claims that Greek philosophy was built on knowledge stolen from the Egyptian school of initiates. James imagined this mystery school as a grandiose organization with branches on many continents, so that the purported system of Egyptian mysteries shaped cultures all over the world.|$|E

25|$|In 1893, {{soon after}} {{becoming}} {{a member of}} the <b>Theosophical</b> <b>Society</b> she went to India for the first time. After a dispute the American section split away into an independent organisation. The original society, then led by Henry Steel Olcott and Besant, is today based in Chennai, India, and is known as the <b>Theosophical</b> <b>Society</b> Adyar. Following the split Besant devoted much of her energy not only to the society, but also to India's freedom and progress. Besant Nagar, a neighbourhood near the <b>Theosophical</b> <b>Society</b> in Chennai, is named in her honour.|$|E

Krishnamurti and later to her studies in the 1930 s with eminent modern yogis of India, Swami Kuvalayananda and Sri T. Krishnamacharya, before {{ultimately}} becoming a devotee of the controversial Satya Sai Baba. It was following Krishnamacharya’s bidding to teach yoga to Westerners that Devi first taught to fellow expatriates in Shanghai during World War II.|$|R
25|$|At {{this time}} popular {{awareness}} {{of the idea of}} reincarnation was boosted by the <b>Theosophical</b> <b>Society's</b> dissemination of systematised and universalised Indian concepts and also by the influence of magical societies like The Golden Dawn. Notable personalities like Annie Besant, W. B. Yeats and Dion Fortune made the subject almost as familiar an element of the popular culture of the west as of the east. By 1924 the subject could be satirised in popular children's books.|$|R
5000|$|Besant's {{tolerance}} {{for the differences}} in their approaches grew strained over the years. By 1907, Steiner had shifted from Theosophical terminology to his own vocabulary and the uniqueness of his approach was becoming increasingly apparent, for example at the International Congress at Munich in May 1907. Later that year, [...] "by mutual consent", the esoteric circle Steiner had founded as {{an offshoot of the}} <b>Theosophical</b> <b>Society's</b> Esoteric Section (E.
