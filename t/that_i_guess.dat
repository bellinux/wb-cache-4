25|$|The way {{our studio}} {{operated}} was {{that anything that}} comes in – there’s no value judgments made about the music. We just record it. Still, {{one of the things}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> was cool about being a staff engineer is that I wouldn’t have sought out a band like that. I wasn’t philosophically into anything that they were doing, but they were all good musicians – you would have to be to stay together at the speeds they were playing at. So there was that aspect of it, and just the whole pushing the envelope thing. It sounds like it’s just gonna completely break apart going 700 miles through the sky {{and then all of a}} sudden everything just comes right together again.|$|E

[...] "It started off really good for us, unfortunately they just got a couple more runs than us and that's the way it goes sometimes. They played a great game. We stuck together 12 deep from the second the buzzer started, to that end buzzer and no one gave up. I think that we can hold our heads high because of <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> the plan is, next four years, Rio we go one more." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{happened}} to be at Cambridge. I was sent there by the [...] government on a government grant. And I'd read some of Ted's poems in this magazine and I was very impressed and I wanted to meet him. I went to this little celebration and that's actually where we met... Then we saw {{a great deal of}} each other. Ted came back to Cambridge and suddenly we found ourselves getting married a few months later... We kept writing poems to each other. Then it just grew out of <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> a feeling that we both were writing so much and having such a fine time doing it, we decided that this should keep on.|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR BRO,--Barstow wrote <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> {{wanted the}} place I could have it. <b>I</b> wrote him <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>I</b> would take it, {{and asked him}} how long before I must come up there. I have not heard from him since.|$|R
6000|$|... 'By <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> he {{was some}} cheese-paring clerk or {{other of the}} King's Ships, so I gave him the price. I forget it now, but it worked out to thirty pounds--carved, gilt, and fitted in place.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. McRankine smiled sardonically. [...] "Him? He {{came back}} {{rolling his eyes}} so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> him to be troubled in the wind. And he's in bed this hour past with a spoonful of {{peppermint}} in his little wame." ...|$|R
500|$|According to Houston, {{the song}} was direct, so she wanted the video to be direct and {{concentrate}} {{on her face and}} on the lyrics. Whitaker also expressed a same opinion of the song. He said, [...] "I've seen the video [...] It's like a thing she has, you know, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> people would say is like a charisma kinda thing that it zooms, you know, comes up. It's beautiful [...] It's magic, it's spirit." [...] The video aired on MTV on October 10, 1995. According to Marla Shelton, a writer for Camera Obscura, a journal of feminism and film theory, [...] "the video concept's originality stops with Houston's hair style as its stark simplicity underscores the 'straight and narrow' politics of the film." [...] When the film was released, the video was shown as a trailer prior to the beginning of films on 450 General Cinema screens in some major US media markets.|$|E
500|$|... totally rave-y... and that's the feeling, just music rushing over you, {{and then}} I started {{thinking}} about drugs and addiction and love and how that's an addiction... we've all lived {{the ups and downs}} of being in a toxic relationship. It's really about the obstacles of trying to let it go, but at the same time how great it makes you feel, so it's hard to let it go. Again, it goes back to a story that we all can relate to... It's not Rihanna's story; it's her story in the video, and she's acting. But everybody's [...] Obviously, there's a lot of comparisons to her real life, and that's not at all the intention. It's just <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> people naturally go there because art imitates life, and it's a story we all relate to and we've all experienced. Like, it's based on my life; it's based on her life; it's based on your life, like, everybody.|$|E
500|$|In a 1994 interview, Joel {{dismissed}} {{criticism of}} unclear elements in their films: [...] "People {{have a problem}} dealing {{with the fact that}} our movies are not straight-ahead. They would prefer that the last half of Barton Fink just be about a screenwriter's writing-block problems and how they get resolved in the real world...." [...] Talk show host Larry King expressed approval of the movie, despite its uncertain conclusion. He wrote in USA Today: [...] "The ending is something I'm still thinking about and if they accomplished <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> it worked." [...] In a 2016 interview, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman said after being asked which film he would want with him on a deserted island, [...] "A movie I really love is Barton Fink. I don’t know if that’s the movie I’d take to a desert island, but I feel like there’s so much in there, you could watch it again and again. That’s important to me, especially if that was the only movie I’d have with {{me for the rest of}} my life." ...|$|E
60|$|Now, {{if there}} was any subject of which I was profoundly ignorant, it was this. But the old man was evidently bent on having a good {{political}} talk. So I said vaguely, yet with a certain sense of security, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> there wasn't much being done.|$|R
6000|$|Doctor Winchester's {{comment and}} my own were made at the same moment. I said only the one word [...] "Checkmate!" [...] from which I think he may have {{gathered}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> more of his idea and purpose than perhaps I had intentionally conveyed to him. He murmured: ...|$|R
6000|$|... “She {{is remarkably}} beautiful,” I said. “I never saw {{anything}} like {{her in my}} life. In spite of the fact, last night, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> she was mad, I could not keep my eyes off of her. It wasn’t curiosity. It was wonder, sheer wonder, she was so strangely beautiful.” ...|$|R
2500|$|In June 2010, Green Bay Packer quarterback Aaron Rodgers criticized Kornheiser's {{performance}} on Monday Night Football, saying: [...] "He's terrible...I don’t think he’s funny. I don’t think he’s insightful. I don’t think he knows, really, anything about sports.”. Rodgers also criticized ESPN analyst Ron Jaworski and other ESPN employees during the interview. Kornheiser responded {{in an interview}} by saying: [...] "If he thinks I’m no good, he wouldn’t be the first. Or the last.” and [...] "I tried to establish some rapport with <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> that rapport didn’t exist.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Friedrich was the co-creator {{and initial}} writer of Marvel's motorcycle-demon Ghost Rider, and later teamed with that character's first artist, Mike Ploog, on Marvel's Monster of Frankenstein – {{the first five}} issues of which (Jan.-Oct. 1973) {{contained}} a relatively faithful adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel. As one critic wrote of issue #4: [...] "Unmatched by anything else he'd written at Marvel, Friedrich's script ... had reached a point that perfectly captured the 19th-century cadences of Shelley's prose and lifted the strip far above any past or, so far, future attempt to adapt the character to comics." [...] Friedrich co-created the supernatural hero the Son of Satan in Ghost Rider vol. 2, #1 (Sept. 1973). Friedrich recalled in 2009 that Marvel editor-in-chief Stan Lee [...] "had some idea that he wanted a character called Son of Satan. I {{have no idea why}} or where it came from. All he really had was the name and he wanted us to create a character based around <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> it just popped in his mind. He said [...] "I want a title called Son of Satan. Do it!" ...|$|E

60|$|MINNIE. Don't {{you believe}} it, Mrs. Pindar. I knew {{a woman in}} Newcastle--but there's no use going into <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> There's worse kinds of badness than what you call bad.|$|E
6000|$|Her voice {{dropped to}} a lower key, and Bartley said, [...] "I'm sorry to hear <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> she isn't failing. But of course she's getting on, and every year makes a difference." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Boys," [...] he said, [...] "when Saunders makes a {{proposition}} {{of that kind}} it's because he sees how he's going to {{get something out of}} it. But for all <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> it's sound advice he's giving you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Paret," [...] he said suddenly, [...] "I don't care a {{damn about}} Grunewald--never did. I'd turn him down for ten cents. But you can tell Theodore Watling for me, and Dickinson, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> the 'inducement' can be fixed." ...|$|E
