It features all backgrounds and characters drawn in a low-color pixelated style with emulated scanlines, and chiptune music played through an emulated FM chip with no voice acting. The premise of the game features Rintarō Okabe receiving a D-Mail from himself in 2025 that states that he must save the future by reclaiming an IBN 5100 from a person under of the alias [...] "Neidhardt". <b>This</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> Takumi Nishijō of Chaos;Head, as he runs under the same player name in his favorite MMORPG, and the D-Mail stating that [...] "Neidhardt" [...] lives in Shibuya and has [...] "inherent, supernatural abilities", a reference to his power as a gigalomaniac.
