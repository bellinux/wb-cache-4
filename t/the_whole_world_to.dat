25|$|Since {{at least}} 1700, Russian intellectuals {{have sought to}} Latinise the Russian {{language}} in their desire for close relations with the West. The Bolsheviks had four goals: to break with Tsarism, to spread socialism to <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world,</b> <b>to</b> isolate the Muslim inhabitants of the Soviet Union from the Arabic-Islamic world and religion, and eradicate illiteracy through simplification. They concluded the Latin alphabet was the right tool to do so, and after seizing power during the Russian Revolution of 1917, they made plans to realise these ideals.|$|E

This would violate the chief principle of Change. Instead, one adjusts one's own mind through detachment so that the Change, of whatever nature, has no effect on one's peace of mind. Briefly stated, the third Noble Truth implies that elimination of the cause (craving) eliminates the result (suffering). This is implied by the scriptural quote by The Buddha, 'Whatever may result from a cause, shall be eliminated by the elimination of the cause'.|$|E

500|$|Early critics {{maintained}} that Mahler's adoption {{of many different}} styles to suit different expressions of feeling meant that he lacked a style of his own; Cooke {{on the other hand}} asserts that Mahler [...] "redeemed any borrowings by imprinting his [...] personality on practically every note" [...] to produce music of [...] "outstanding originality." [...] The music critic Harold Schonberg sees the essence of Mahler's music in the theme of struggle, in the tradition of Beethoven.
