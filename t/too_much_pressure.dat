5|$|Reflections on {{the race}} by the organisers and the media {{generally}} concluded that the Grand Prix had been a poor replacement for the Gordon Bennett races. In part, this had been because the race was too long, and the system of starting the race—with each car leaving at 90-second intervals—had meant {{that there had been}} very little interaction between the competitors, simply cars driving their own races to time. The ACF decided that <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>pressure</b> had been put on drivers and riding mechanics by forbidding others to work on the cars during the race. It was also felt that the outcome of the race had been too dependent on the use of Michelin's detachable rims. Clément had driven the only Clément-Bayard to not have the rims, and it was thought that this contributed to Nazzaro passing him on the second day as he stopped to change tyres. Despite this, the ACF decided to run the Grand Prix again the following year. The publicity generated by the race prompted the German governing body to organise a similar event that favoured their own industry. The forerunner to the German Grand Prix, the Kaiserpreis (Kaiser's Prize) was raced in 1907.|$|E

25|$|However the Australians, {{led by the}} {{authoritative}} Allan Border were in a ruthless mood. They had home series victories against Sri Lanka and Pakistan, but had lost a one-off test to New Zealand since the 1989 Ashes series victory, and Border and his men were determined to defend the trophy. The Australians came out aggressively from the start, and combined with moments of bad-luck for the tourists, proved <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>pressure</b> for the England side to handle. The five test series was won 3-0 by Australia.|$|E

25|$|In general, the stirrup {{is placed}} on the ball of the foot, {{allowing}} the rider to let his weight flow down the back of the leg into the heel by way of the flexible ankle. This provides the rider {{with the support of the}} stirrup while still allowing for him to easily absorb the shock of the horse's motion. If the stirrup is too far forward, on the toes, the rider risks losing if he pushes with <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>pressure</b> (forcing it off the foot) or too little (allowing it to simply slide off).|$|E
25|$|Sore nipples (nipple pain, or thelalgia) are {{probably}} the most common complaint after the birth. They are generally reported by the second day after delivery but improve within 5 days. Pain beyond the first week, severe pain, cracking, fissures or localized swelling is not normal. The mother should see a doctor for further evaluation. Sore nipples, a common cause of pain, often come from the baby not latching on properly. Factors include <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>pressure</b> on the nipple when not enough of the areola is latched onto and an improper release of suction {{at the end of the}} feeding. Improper use of breast pumps or topical remedies can also contribute. Nipple pain can also be a sign of infection. When the baby bites the nipple it can also be painful.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} styles of mechanical press, these can range from a simple wooden basket with vertical slats and a capstan providing pressure to large hydraulic presses that can even be enclosed to prevent exposure oxygen. An advantage of this style of press is the usually gentle means that it presses the grape but its disadvantages includes the labor intensiveness of its use, small volumes and tendency to provide uneven pressure to {{all parts of the}} cake as well as usually exposing the must to significant amounts of oxygen. Another disadvantage from a time perspective but an advantage in other regards such as gentleness, is that by its nature pressing with a basket press is very slow. Applying <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>pressure</b> too rapidly can break the press.|$|E

5000|$|Oversinging has two meanings. One is a {{technical}} understanding, where oversinging {{is understood as}} [...] "pushing the voice", and [...] "is when a singer pushes <b>too</b> <b>much</b> breath <b>pressure</b> through the larynx", which is known as overblowing of the vocal folds. The result is over-production of sound.|$|R

25|$|One of the {{difficulties}} that result from these long development times and high costs is making accurate cores repeatably. This is extremely important because the core {{is an integral part}} of the mold, so essentially each shot is into a new mold cavity. Another difficulty is keeping the core from melting when the plastic is shot into the mold, because the plastic is approximately twice the melting temperature of the core material. A third difficulty is the low strength of the core. Hollow plastic cores can collapse if <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>pressure</b> is used in the shot plastic. Metal cores (with low melting temperatures) are solid so they cannot collapse, but are only 10% as strong as steel cores so they can distort. This is especially a problem when molding manifolds, because the waviness of the core can be detrimental to the airflow within the runners.|$|E
25|$|On 28 February 2008 it was {{announced}} that the ITV network, the BBC's main rival, had hired Fincham to be their new Director of Television. At the Edinburgh Television Festival in August 2008, Fincham claimed that broadcasters such as ITV were under <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>pressure</b> from industry regulator OfCom to produce programmes that were only of a minority interest, as opposed to pure entertainment programmes for a mainstream audience. In 2010 he took the decision to axe the long-running drama series The Bill; ATV News Network reported 97% of the public were against the drama being dropped.. In December 2011, he took the unilateral decision to remove a song from the Jonathan Ross Show that was commissioned especially for the show by the comedian and songwriter Tim Minchin. The song, called Woody Allen Jesus, had already been approved by Ross's producer and ITV's legal compliance officers. Minchin, disappointed at the decision, later made the footage available on his own site where he also criticised Fincham's decision.|$|E
25|$|Near 2:00 A.M. on April 27, 1865, when Sultana {{was just}} seven {{miles north of}} Memphis, her boilers {{suddenly}} exploded. First one boiler exploded, followed a split second later by two more. The cause of the explosion was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>pressure</b> and low water in the boilers. There was reason to believe allowable working steam pressure was exceeded {{in an attempt to}} overcome the spring river current. The enormous explosion of steam came from the top, rear of the boilers and went upward at a 45-degree angle, tearing through the crowded decks above, and completely demolishing the pilothouse. Without a pilot to steer the boat, Sultana became a drifting, floating hulk. The terrific explosion flung some of the passengers on deck into the water and destroyed a large section of the boat. The twin smokestacks toppled over, one backwards into the blasted hole, and one forward onto the crowded forward section of the upper deck. The forward part of the upper decks collapsed into the exposed furnace boxes, shoving kindling into the open fire boxes which soon caught fire and turned the remaining superstructure into an inferno. Survivors of the explosion panicked and raced {{for the safety of the}} water but in their weakened condition soon ran out of strength and began to cling to each other. Whole groups went down together.|$|E
50|$|During {{direct contact}} {{one must be}} careful because the stamp can easily be {{physically}} deformed causing printed features that {{are different from the}} original stamp features. Horizontally stretching or compressing the stamp will cause deformations in the raised and recessed features. Also, applying <b>too</b> <b>much</b> vertical <b>pressure</b> on the stamp during printing can cause the raised relief features to flatten against the substrate. These deformations can yield submicron features even though the original stamp has a lower resolution.|$|R
50|$|Designing a fender system {{basically}} is determining what the berthing {{energy of a}} vessel or range of vessels will be, then determine what capacity the fender needs to have to absorb that kinetic energy and finally {{how to find a}} way to avoid the reaction force creating <b>too</b> <b>much</b> hull <b>pressure.</b> In principle, a berthing energy calculation is a simple kinetic energy calculation, adjusted for specific behaviour of a berthing vessel or the specific characteristics of the berthing location or structure.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} {{criticism}} of the proposals is that increasing tuition fees will increase the level of debt graduates will have when they leave. Organisations such as the National Union of Students have argued that students are already under <b>too</b> <b>much</b> financial <b>pressure,</b> and that this will make things worse, not better. Many students have had to take up part-time work {{in order to pay}} living costs while studying, and this has been shown to have an adverse effect on their results.|$|R
500|$|John Boyle, {{a native}} of Armagh and owner of Boylesports, {{expressed}} an interest in placing a £250,000 bet with nine other businessmen, each of whom would contribute £25,000, on Armagh winning the championship. The winnings and the stake would have been given to the Armagh squad. GAA president Seán Kelly denounced the idea: [...] "Playing is a voluntary activity and should {{have nothing to do with}} gambling. Such bets put <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>pressure</b> on the players and are somewhat obscene." [...] The GAA was also critical of tickets for the final being sold in newspaper columns and on online auction sites.|$|E
500|$|Feng {{also participated}} in the women's team {{competition}} with Li Jiawei and Wang Yuegu. They were beaten 0–3 by Japan in the semifinals, but took the bronze medal by edging out South Korea 3–0. Feng defeated Kim Kyung Ah 11–9, 11–8, 4–11, 13–11, Li also successfully fended off Seok Ha Jung 11–5, 11–8, 6–11, 11–8. Li and Wang then succeeded in the doubles game against Seok and Dang Ye Seo 11–9, 11–6, 6–11, 11–5. This {{marked the first time}} Singapore had won more than one medal at an Olympic Games. Feng commented: [...] "Against Japan, we gave ourselves <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>pressure</b> and lost the psychological battle. After that, I told myself that I must prepare myself well mentally and it's only when I do what I'm capable of that I can win." ...|$|E
500|$|Dutch {{journalist}} Michiel Jongsma {{suggests that}} Kieftenbeld's position {{of choice is}} as a holding midfielder {{in front of the}} defence, where he can best use his energy in recovering the ball. He is comfortable on the ball and able to distribute it, but can be careless in possession, and [...] "he really tries to shake up things when the play has gone dormant. In that lies his weakness as wellhe can pick up silly fouls and cards from time to time." [...] With Groningen, he averaged eight yellow cards a season. According to Groningen's technical director Henk Veldmate, speaking in 2014, his battling style and never-say-die attitude made him the sort of player with whom supporters could identify. In a 2011 interview, Kieftenbeld described himself as a perfectionist who always wanted to improve, and said that he sometimes put <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>pressure</b> on himself.|$|E

Critical at first ("Listen to the pneumatic hiss {{at the heart}} of this song. Try and endure the pumping thrust without getting winded. There is simply <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>pressure</b> being stuffed into our ears, with too much brutal force"), he concluded that Rihanna sings the song with great passion and gave it four stars out of five.

After his Wimbledon loss to Kyrgios, Raonic commented that his foot injury had led to problems throughout his body: [...] "There wasn't a place it wasn't ... First ankle, then the hip, and then the back. Then when those things aren't working, you just put <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>pressure</b> on your shoulder, and then your shoulder hurts." [...] The cascading injuries led to a withdrawal from Canada's Davis Cup tie against Belgium; a withdrawal from the Washington Open, where Raonic was the defending champion; first round losses at the Canadian Open and Cincinnati Masters; and a third round loss at the US Open to López.|$|E
500|$|Ganzi Mugula, {{who at the}} age of 33 was {{participating}} in his first Olympic Games, was notable for carrying the flag of Uganda in the opening and closing ceremonies. He attempted to qualify for the previous three Olympic Games but did not succeed, but made the London Summer Games via a universality place awarded by FINA because his best time of 27.51 seconds did not reach the [...] "A" [...] or [...] "B" [...] standard entry times for his event, the men's 50 metre freestyle. Mugula was drawn in the second heat on 2 August, finishing fifth out of eight swimmers, with a time of 27.58 seconds.

Overall he finished 53rd out of 58 swimmers, and was unable to advance to the semi-finals after being 5.11 seconds slower than the slowest competitor who progressed to the later stages. After the event Mugula said: [...] "I felt this time I was fitter. I think psychologically I put <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>pressure</b> on myself. But it's OK, I'm not disappointed.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the efficiency}} of centralized public goods provision in a model of incomplete contracts. Politicians determine the level of provision through wasteful yet publicly unobservable lobbying efforts. Thereby a threat of dismissal from office caused by regional expectations in terms of reservation utility induces politicians to push for influence of their region’s taste. In a static setting the performance of central governance is solely hampered by larger diversity of regional preferences. On the contrary, in a repeated game setting the ability to cooperate depends crucially on voter expectations. Via endogenous discounting it can be shown that rather <b>too</b> <b>much</b> national <b>pressure</b> hinders efficiencysustaining cooperation.

40|$|In 1969, Sir Roy Meadow {{published}} {{a paper in}} which he described the ‘captive mother’ as one who, admitted with her child, would be stuck in a hospital ward with a child with whom she would not normally spend much of her day.

A busy mother, whose job as housewife and carer of other children was jeopardised by having to stay away from the home, was caused great inconvenience and trouble, and it was unrealistic and put <b>too</b> <b>much</b> unnecessary <b>pressure</b> on the mother (and the family) to insist that she stay with the child.

500|$|A neo {{soul and}} R album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill {{incorporates}} musical styles such as soul, hip hop, and reggae. Some songs {{are based in}} hip hop soul.

500|$|On {{aggregate}} site Metacritic, Pandora's Tower {{received a}} score of 73/100 based on 48 critic reviews, denoting [...] "mixed or average" [...] reception. Destructoid's Tony Ponce praised the game's premise and how fleshed out Elena was despite {{her role as a}} damsel in distress, but felt that there was too much background lore, and that Aeron's lack of personality hurt the relationship aspect. Andrew Fitch, writing for Electronic Gaming Monthly, praised the world design, but faulted the lack of character development given to Aeron and Elena. Eurogamer's Matt Edwards referred to the game's plot as [...] "a soppy and yet surprisingly sinister love story", saying that moments between the couple raised a genuine smile. IGN's Chris Schilling said that while the story was [...] "slight", it was bolstered by a good localization and voice acting, in addition to darker elements in the plot and during cutscenes. GameSpot's Ashton Raze praised Aeron and Elena's romance as [...] "a grounded, human [...] in a world of monsters". Heidi Kemps, writing for Joystiq, noted genuine emotion in the relationship mechanics of Aeron and Elema, while Steve Hogarty of Official Nintendo Magazine referred to the scenario as [...] "a boy-meets-girl love story with a Clive Barker twist" [...] in addition to praising its dark tone. The game's time limit mechanic and its impact on Elena's condition divided opinion: some praised its implementation, but some critics noted that it might put <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>pressure</b> on the player.|$|E

Later, in April of that year, he released two more books: Get in the Game: 8 Elements of Perseverance That Make the Difference, co-written with Donald T. Phillips, described as a motivational guide to success; and The Longest Season, co-written with Ron Mazellan, a children's book about the Orioles' 1988 season. In 2011, he released Hothead, a children's fiction book co-written with Kevin Cowherd which was also a New York Times bestseller.

50|$|The chief use of {{the vocal}} fry {{register}} in singing is to obtain pitches of very low frequency, which are not available to the singer in the modal register. Although the physiological production of the vocal fry register may be extended up into the modal register, most vocal pedagogues discourage such practices, as it may cause damage to the vocal cords. Also, many voice teachers discourage singers from using the vocal fry register frequently, as it may cause the singer to lose some of the upper notes in the modal register. In some cases, vocal pedagogues have found the use of vocal fry therapeutically helpful to students who have trouble producing lower notes. Singers often lose their low notes or never learn to produce them beca{{use of the}} excessive tension of the laryngeal muscles and of the support mechanism that leads to <b>too</b> <b>much</b> breath <b>pressure.</b>|$|R

50|$|Wood's {{philosophy}} {{was to make}} education responsive to the students. As director and professor emeritus his contention was that teachers spent <b>too</b> <b>much</b> time <b>pressuring</b> the students to take exactly the prescribed information given in the curriculum courses.

Wood's {{philosophy was}} to get the student to think creatively, rather than memorize bits and pieces that would be lost shortly thereafter. The students always depended on the teacher for the answer, rather than finding the answer themselves. He argued and pointed out that schools were just turning out intellectual zombies. He alleged the concept of thoughtful curiosity was being withheld from students. He understood that certain basics were necessary, but even then should be taught to the student with logic and reasoning behind the principle.
