500|$|For {{the next}} few weeks we got twice as many {{requests}} for [...] "Another One Rides the Bus" [...] as for everything else put together. Thank goodness I had a tape rolling! We even got it in stereo. Over {{the next couple of months}} <b>that</b> <b>tape</b> was duplicated and re-duplicated all over the world, as the song took on a life of its own. [...] The Dr. Demento Show gained a couple of dozen new station affiliates just because of that song.|$|E
500|$|On 3 March 2008, {{recording}} {{started at}} The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, where Stiff Upper Lip was recorded, and lasted [...] for eight weeks. Engineer Mike Fraser, who has mixed all AC/DC albums since The Razors Edge, said they recorded in batches of three songs to [...] "keep things interesting" [...] {{and to avoid}} overextended sessions. According to Fraser, the band had not rehearsed the songs before entering the studio. Despite [...] "a couple of tweaks in the writing, sparkling up the choruses a bit better" [...] during the recording, the compositions were mostly complete. Still, the Young brothers had new ideas during production, including the song [...] "Anything Goes", which was written when the studio sessions were nearly finished. The songs were mostly recorded live in the studio; the instruments and backing vocals were recorded in the live room and the vocals at both the control room and an overdubbing booth. The performances were first recorded with analogue equipment, as Fraser considers <b>that</b> <b>tape</b> conveys [...] "the sound of rock & roll", and then digitised for mixing and overdubs. [...] Fraser tried to not alter the original recordings – [...] "I used Pro-Tools purely as a tape machine" [...] – with no effects on the bass and rhythm guitar, sparse delay and reverb effects on the vocals and other instruments and overdubs were only used for the lead guitar and vocals.|$|E

50|$|Further, Walsh {{revealed}} to Goodell <b>that</b> the <b>tapes</b> of the signals stayed with Walsh throughout the game, were not processed during halftime, and {{were given to}} Patriots Football Research Director Ernie Adams after the game. Goodell, who acknowledged in September 2007 <b>that</b> the <b>tapes</b> gave the Patriots no competitive advantage while the game was underway, reiterated the fact <b>that</b> the <b>tapes</b> were not processed during halftime in his post-meeting press conference, but {{said he had never}} accepted Belichick's interpretation of the rules as not prohibiting <b>tapes</b> <b>that</b> are not used within the same game.|$|R
50|$|It was {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>taping</b> {{for an additional}} season of Hogan Knows Best halted {{in the summer of}} 2007, before it was finally determined that the show was canceled in early 2008 due to problems involving Nick, Linda, and Terry Bollea.|$|R
2500|$|At age 11, Parker {{took up the}} drums, {{just like}} his brother, and later was making [...] "excessively melodic music from {{about the age of}} 12 to 15", which was [...] "really weird and {{repetitive}} and almost genre-less", by recording his drumming and overdubbing guitar and other instruments in lo-fi experiments. Speaking about this Parker said [...] "I've always recorded music. When I was 12, I used to set up two tape machines and multi-track myself. First, I'd record a beat on the drums, then, I'd play <b>that</b> <b>tape</b> into another tape recorder while playing keyboard; then I'd take <b>that</b> <b>tape</b> and play bass guitar along with the drums and keyboard. I'd keep adding instruments. I did {{that for a long time}} until my dad bought me an 8-track, and then I continued recording music by myself, even if I was in other bands at the same time." [...] This hobby turned into an obsession for Parker who was [...] "just doing music all the time, I never did any homework, I'd just spend every night in the garage recording music." [...] Parker got his first eight-track recorder at age 16.|$|E
2500|$|After graduating, Thomas {{subsequently}} {{embarked on}} his comedy career, initially supporting himself through working on building sites with his father. Thomas' early exposure to comedy was through watching {{and listening to}} Dave Allen, Steptoe and Son, The Goon Show and Tony Hancock; his biggest influence was hearing a recording of Alexei Sayle: [...] "It was like someone had kicked the door in - just listening to <b>that</b> <b>tape</b> and thinking that someone could do this stuff". He went on to write material for Dave Allen.|$|E
2500|$|The fire, {{from its}} inception, was caught on {{videotape}} by cameraman Brian Butler for WPRI-TV of Providence, {{and the beginning}} of <b>that</b> <b>tape</b> was released to national news stations. Butler was there for a planned piece on nightclub safety being reported by Jeffrey A. Derderian, a WPRI news reporter who was also a part-owner of The Station. WPRI-TV would later be cited for conflict of interest in having a reporter do a report concerning his own property. The report had been inspired by the E2 nightclub stampede in Chicago that had claimed 21 lives only three days earlier. At the scene of the fire, Butler gave this account of the tragedy: ...|$|E

2500|$|On <b>that</b> <b>tape,</b> Jones tells Temple {{members that}} the Soviet Union, {{with whom the}} Temple had been {{negotiating}} a potential exodus for months, would not take them after the airstrip murders. The reason given by Jones to commit suicide was consistent with his previously stated conspiracy theories of intelligence organizations allegedly conspiring against the Temple, that men would [...] "parachute in here on us", [...] "shoot some of our innocent babies" [...] and [...] "they'll torture our children, they'll torture some of our people here, they'll torture our seniors". Parroting Jones' prior statements that hostile forces would convert captured children to fascism, one temple member states [...] "the ones that they take captured, they're gonna just let them grow up and be dummies".|$|E
2500|$|In {{one of two}} {{instances}} {{throughout the}} trial when prosecutor Stephen Kay was reduced to tears, {{he walked out of}} the courtroom during the recess following the hearing of the recording of Shirley Ledford's rape, abuse and torture. Weeping openly, Kay stated to the reporters gathered outside the courtroom: [...] "Everybody who has heard <b>that</b> <b>tape</b> has had it affect their lives. I just picture those girls... how alone they were when they died." [...] When questioned by reporters as to whether the audio tape should have been introduced into evidence, given the obvious psychological and emotional trauma caused to many in the courtroom through the contents being broadcast, Kay simply stated: [...] "You're darn right it [...] should have been. The jury needs to know what these guys did." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Just imagine Mayor Emanuel had {{released}} the video in, say, November —without {{being forced to}} by a lawsuit.... But of course, he didn't do the right thing. He buried the video. He allowed officials to mislead the public. He hid the tapes because most likely he [...] assumed it would hurt his reelection campaign. Thus he {{not only did the}} immoral thing, he did the politically stupid thing. Cook County state's attorney Anita Alvarez probably would've quickly responded with an indictment—just like she did earlier this week, when the tape actually was released. I mean, it's really hard to look at <b>that</b> <b>tape</b> and not call for an indictment. If the mayor had done that, he wouldn't be the villain in this sordid story. He'd be the hero. Or at least the guy who finally, for once in his life, did the right thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|The band soon {{recorded}} a four-song demo tape in Mars's basement {{and handed it}} to Peter Jesperson in May 1980. Jesperson was the manager of Oar Folkjokeopus, a punk rock record store in Minneapolis, and had also founded Twin/Tone Records with Paul Stark (a local recording engineer) and Charley Hallman. Westerberg originally handed in the tape to see if the band could perform at Jay's Longhorn Bar, a local venue where Jesperson worked as a disc jockey. (The band's first performance at a bar was at the Longhorn on July 2, 1980.) He eavesdropped as Jesperson put in the tape, only to run away as soon as the first song, [...] "Raised in the City", played. Jesperson played the song again and again. [...] "If I've ever had a magic moment in my life, it was popping <b>that</b> <b>tape</b> in", said Jesperson. [...] "I didn't even get through the first song before I thought my head was going to explode".|$|E

Rush Limbaugh is an entertainer. Rush Limbaugh's whole thing is entertainment. Yes, it is incendiary. Yes, it is ugly." [...] On March 2, 2009 Limbaugh said on his radio show that Steele is not fit to lead the Republican Party, asking of him [...] "Why do you claim to lead the Republican Party when you seem obsessed with seeing to it President Obama succeeds?" [...] After the show Steele called Limbaugh to apologize, saying [...] "I have {{enormous}} respect for Rush Limbaugh. I was {{maybe a little bit}} inarticulate. There was no attempt on my part to diminish his voice or his leadership. I went back at <b>that</b> <b>tape</b> and I realized words that I said weren't what I was thinking. It {{was one of those things}} where I thinking I was saying one thing, and it came out differently. What I was trying to say was a lot of people want to make Rush the scapegoat, the bogeyman, and he's not." [...] Steele later issued another statement to say that Limbaugh [...] "is a national conservative leader, and in no way do I want to diminish his voice. I truly apologize." ...|$|E

"Yes, sir, {{one gets}} a {{military}} look after seeing numberless wars; and so, happily {{for the need}} of both, I have now come to the part of my secret which touches more particularly {{on the character of}} that vessel. There sat I, reflecting on {{the manner in which the}} strange seamen had been deluded by my tonguey neighbour--for, as you should know, sir, a desperate talker is <b>that</b> <b>Tape,</b> and a younker who has seen but one war at the utmost--therefore, was I thinking of the manner in which he had enticed my lawful customers from my shop, when, as one thought is the father of another, the following concluding reasoning, as our pious priest has it weekly in his reviving and searching discourses, came uppermost in my mind: If these mariners were honest and conscientious slavers, would they overlook a labouring man with a large family, to pour their well-earned gold into the lap of a common babbler? I proclaimed to myself at once, sir, that they would not. I was bold to say the same in my own mind, and, thereupon, I openly put the question to all in hearing, If they are not slavers, what are they? A question which the King himself would, in his royal wisdom, allow to be a question easier asked than answered; upon which I replied, If the vessel be no fair-trading slaver, nor a common cruiser of his Majesty, it is as tangible as the best man's reasoning, that she may be neither more nor less than the ship of that nefarious pirate the Red Rover." ...|$|E
