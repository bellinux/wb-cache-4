A record high 4 T <b>trapped</b> <b>field</b> at {{the surface of the}} unirradiated disks is observed.

40|$|High {{temperature}} superconducting (HTS) bulks or {{stacks of}} coated conductors (CCs) can be magnetized to become <b>trapped</b> <b>field</b> magnets (TFMs). The magnetic fields of such TFMs can break {{the limitation of}} conventional magnets (< 2 T), so they show potential for improving the performance of many electrical applications that use permanent magnets like rotating machines. Towards practical or commercial use of TFMs, effective in situ magnetization {{is one of the}} key issues. The pulsed field magnetization (PFM) is among the most promising magnetization methods in virtue of its compactness, mobility and low cost. However, due to the heat generation during the magnetization, the <b>trapped</b> <b>field</b> and flux acquired by PFM usually cannot achieve the full potential of a sample (acquired by the field cooling or zero field cooling method). The multi-pulse technique was found to effectively improve the <b>trapped</b> <b>field</b> by PFM in practice. In this work, a systematic study on the PFM with successive pulses is presented. A 2 D electromagnetic-thermal coupled model with comprehensive temperature dependent parameters is used to simulate a stack of CCs magnetized by successive magnetic pulses.

40|$|The {{ability of}} stacks of superconducting tapes to trap large {{magnetic}} fields makes them ideal candidates for creating powerful permanent magnets of compact size and mass. Experimentally, several techniques {{are used to}} trap the maximum possible field in a given practical application. However, regardless of the magnetization method used, there is a physical limit to the maximum magnetic field that a given superconducting magnet can trap. This limit is given by the geometric design, the particular superconducting material used and the temperature of operation. Knowing the maximum possible <b>trapped</b> <b>field</b> is important for device design as it provides an upper limit for applications such as magnetic bearings or rotating machinery. In this work we present a collection of finite element method (FEM) models in 2 D and 3 D capable of estimating the maximum <b>trapped</b> <b>field</b> of stacked tape superconducting magnets.

40|$|The world {{demand for}} energy is {{estimated}} to increase by up to 70 % from 2016 to 2040. To meet this demand in a sustainable way, the power density of electric motors and generators can be increased by using superconducting materials. In particular, <b>trapped</b> <b>field</b> superconducting magnets, where the field is generated by a circulating persistent current in the sample, can create magnetic fields {{an order of magnitude}} higher than possible using conventional ferromagnets, thus increasing the power density of motors and generators. This is of great interest where added weight comes at a premium, such as for naval propulsion motors, wind generators and motors/generators for future electric aircraft. This work investigates the suitability of stacked tape layers of second generation high temperature superconductors (HTS), such as YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x (YBCO) for <b>trapped</b> <b>field</b> applications. The present limits for <b>trapped</b> <b>field</b> magnitude have been determined, which provide a basis for the optimization of pulsed field magnetization techniques for in-situ magnetization in motors and generators. Trapped fields were increased by optimising the magnetic pulse sequence, using thermally conductive material to reduce temperature rise during pulse and changing the duration of the magnetic field pulse. Finite element method computer modelling was used to model and predict the behaviour of the <b>trapped</b> <b>field</b> magnets made of HTS tape with good agreement to experiment for both field cooling and pulsed field magnetisation.

The highest <b>trapped</b> <b>field,</b> B_Tmax, of 2. 93 T was achieved at 40 K {{in the case of}} the permendur yoke, which was slightly higher than that obtained for the flat soft iron or the tapered soft iron yokes, and was much higher than 2. 20 T in the case without the yoke. The insertion effect of the yoke on the <b>trapped</b> <b>field</b> characteristics was also investigated using numerical simulations. The results suggest that the saturation magnetic flux density, B_sat, of the yoke acts to reduce the flux flow due to its hysteretic magnetization curve and the higher electrical conductivity, σ, of the yoke material also acts to suppress the flux increase rate. A flux jump (or flux leap) can be reproduced in the ascending stage of PFM using numerical simulation, using an assumption of relatively high J_c(T, B) characteristics.

The effect of these modifications on the magnetic hysteresis curve and <b>trapped</b> <b>field</b> of the bulk superconductor at 77 K are then studied using pick-up coil and Hall probe measurements. The experimental data are compared to finite element modelling of the magnetic flux distribution using Campbell’s algorithm. Initially we establish the validity of the technique involving pick-up coils wrapped around the bulk superconductor to obtain its magnetic hysteresis curve in a non-destructive way and highlight the difference between the measured signal and the true magnetization of the sample. We then consider the properties of hybrid ferromagnet/superconductor (F/S) structures. Hall probe measurements, together with the results of the model, establish that flux lines curve outwards through the ferromagnet, which acts, effectively, like a magnetic short circuit. Magnetic hysteresis curves show that the effects of the superconductor and the ferromagnet simply add when the ferromagnet is saturated fully by the applied field.
