40|$|Partial {{discharge}} (PD) detection is {{an important}} technique for assessing the health of high voltage power transformers. A partial discharge signal within an oil-filled power transformer may reach a winding first, then travel along the winding to the bushing core bar. The bushing, acting like a capacitor, can transfer the high frequency components of the partial discharge signal to its <b>tap</b> <b>point.</b> Previous published work [1] has shown that these high frequency components at the bushing <b>tap</b> <b>point</b> can be detected using a suitable sensor and transmitted to remote digital equipment for on-line analysis. In a high voltage substation there is often excessive electrical noise which may corrupt any measured PD signal from the bushing <b>tap</b> <b>point</b> as the bushing acts as an antenna. If signal transmission is implemented using standard coaxial cables this can result in further corruption of the PD signal. The use of optical transmission techniques therefore has clear advantages not only through improved noise immunity {{but also because it}} realises electrical isolation and improved operator safety. This paper details the application of an electrooptic modulator to generate transmission signals over polarization maintaining optical fibre from the measurement point. The feasibility of this approach has been investigated using PD signals measured at the <b>tap</b> <b>point</b> of a 60 kV bushing, two different PD sources have been used and in both cases it was possible to detect PD activity above 40 pC...|$|R
5000|$|AM {{broadcast}} radios (and {{other consumer}} low frequency receivers) typically use small loop antennas;, a variable capacitor connected across the loop forms a tuned circuit that also tunes the receivers input stage as that capacitor tracks the main tuning. A multiband receiver may contain <b>tap</b> <b>points</b> along the loop winding {{in order to}} tune the loop antenna at widely different frequencies. In older AM radios, the antenna might consist of dozens of turns of wire mounted on {{the back wall of}} the radio (a frame antenna).|$|E
5000|$|Balanced (open line) {{transmission}} lines require a tuner that has two [...] "hot" [...] output terminals, {{rather than one}} [...] "hot" [...] terminal and ground ("cold"). Since all modern transmitters have unbalanced (co-axial) output [...] - [...] almost always 50 Ohms [...] - [...] the most efficient system has the tuner provide a balun (balanced to unbalanced) transformation {{as well as providing}} an impedance match. The tuner usually includes a coil, and the coil can accept or produce either balanced or unbalanced input or output, depending on where the <b>tap</b> <b>points</b> are placed on the coil.|$|E
50|$|If {{only one}} tap changer is required, {{manually}} operated <b>tap</b> <b>points</b> are usually {{made on the}} high voltage (primary) or lower current winding of the transformer to minimize the current handling requirements of the contacts. However, a transformer may include a tap changer on each winding if there are advantages to do so. For example, in power distribution networks, a large step-down transformer may have an off-load tap changer on the primary winding and an on load automatic tap changer on the secondary winding or windings. The high voltage tap is set to match long term system profile on the high voltage network (typically supply voltage averages) and is rarely changed. The low voltage tap may be requested to change positions multiple times each day, without interrupting the power delivery, to follow loading conditions on the low-voltage (secondary winding) network.|$|E
50|$|The {{electrons}} then {{pass through}} a second cavity, similar to the first.

5000|$|Current {{transformers}} {{are often}} constructed by passing a single primary turn (either an insulated cable or an uninsulated bus bar) through a well-insulated toroidal core wrapped with many turns of wire. The CT is typically described by its current ratio from primary to secondary. For example, a 1000:1 CT provides an output current of 1 amperes when 1000 amperes {{flow through the}} primary winding. Standard secondary current ratings are 5 amperes or 1 ampere, compatible with standard measuring instruments. The secondary winding can be single ratio or have several <b>tap</b> <b>points</b> to provide a range of ratios. Care {{must be taken to}} make sure the secondary winding is not disconnected from its low-impedance load while current flows in the primary, as this may produce a dangerously high voltage across the open secondary and may permanently affect the accuracy of the transformer.|$|E
5000|$|An {{autotransformer}} has {{a single}} winding with two end terminals, and one or more terminals at intermediate <b>tap</b> <b>points,</b> or it is a transformer in which the primary and secondary coils have part of, or all of their turns in common. The primary voltage is applied across two of the terminals, and the secondary voltage taken from two terminals, almost always having one terminal {{in common with the}} primary voltage. The primary and secondary circuits therefore have a number of windings turns in common. Since the volts-per-turn is the same in both windings, each develops a voltage in proportion to its number of turns. In an autotransformer part of the current flows directly from the input to the output, and only part is transferred inductively, allowing a smaller, lighter, cheaper core to be used as well as requiring only a single winding. However the voltage and current ratio of autotransformers can be formulated the same as other two-winding transformers: ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} era of complex systems like avionics, {{industrial}} processes, electronic circuits, etc., on-the-fly or on-line fault detection is becoming {{necessary to provide}} uninterrupted services. Measurement limitation based fault detection schemes are applied {{to a wide range}} of systems because sensors cannot be deployed in all the locations from which measurements are required. This paper focuses towards On-Line Testing (OLT) of faults in digital electronic circuits under measurement limitation using the theory of discrete event systems. Most of the techniques presented in the literature on OLT of digital circuits have emphasized on keeping the scheme non-intrusive, low area overhead, high fault coverage, low detection latency etc. However, minimizing <b>tap</b> <b>points</b> (i. e., measurement limitation) of the circuit under test (CUT) by the on-line tester was not considered. Minimizing <b>tap</b> <b>points</b> reduces load on the CUT and this reduces the area overhead of the tester. However, reduction in <b>tap</b> <b>points</b> compromises fault coverage and detection latency. This work studies the effect of minimizing <b>tap</b> <b>points</b> on fault coverage, detection latency and area overhead. Results on ISCAS 89 benchmark circuits illustrate that measurement limitation have minimal impact on fault coverage and detection latency but reduces the area overhead of the tester. Further, it was also found that for a given detection latency and fault coverage, area overhead of the proposed scheme is lower compared to other similar schemes reported in the literature...|$|E

[...] An alternate construction is resistance wire wound on a form, with the wiper sliding axially along the coil. [...] These have lower resolution, since as the wiper moves the resistance changes in steps equal to the resistance of a single turn.|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} introspect into the {{behavior}} of software at runtime is crucial for many security-related tasks, such as virtual machine-based intrusion detection and low-artifact malware analysis. Although some {{progress has been made}} in this task by automatically creating programs that can pas-sively retrieve kernel-level information, two key challenges remain. First, it is currently difficult to extract useful infor-mation from user-level applications, such as web browsers. Second, discovering points within the OS and applications to hook for active monitoring is still an entirely manual process. In this paper we propose a set of techniques to mine the memory accesses made by an operating system and its applications to locate useful places to deploy active monitoring, which we call <b>tap</b> <b>points.</b> We demonstrate the efficacy of our techniques by finding <b>tap</b> <b>points</b> for useful introspection tasks such as finding SSL keys and monitor-ing web browser activity on five different operating systems (Windows 7, Linux, FreeBSD, Minix and Haiku) and two processor architectures (ARM and x 86). ...|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of partial discharge (PD) measurement data obtained using radio frequency current transducers (RFCT) {{incorporated into the}} external earthing connections (i. e bushing <b>tap</b> <b>points</b> and neutral to earth connections) offers the possibility of on-line condition monitoring of large transformers. A method for locating PD sources in windings has been developed, based on {{analysis of}} differential equations that model the propagation of PD signals from the source to the measurement point. Analysis reveals that if the discharge at the source {{is assumed to be}} impulse-like, then the form of the response at the measurement points can be simulated as a function of source location along the winding. If all parameters of the winding are known then it is possible to model the response, however, in the field this is often not the case. So the method developed here uses information from the PD measurements themselves to estimate the unknown coefficients required to simulate the likely discharge currents. With these estimates it is then possible to compare PD measurement information with simulation data in order to identify the most likely location of a PD source. An experiment based on a section of high voltage winding has been used to produce PD measurement data and to validate the proposed approach...|$|E

40|$|Water {{separation}} in an upward, inclined separation tube, with distributed <b>tapping</b> <b>points</b> {{has been}} studied, verified and modeled in this thesis. Phase segregation in an upward inclined pipe is widely occurring {{in oil and}} gas production flow systems, but using the phenomenon for a controlled phase separation is somewhat novel and requires the establishment of understanding of the governing parameters. The thesis research consists of two major parts; 1. Conducting laboratory experiments to validate the separation concept, to quantify its efficiency and to acquire data to develop the separation model. 2. Modeling the separation process analytically to establish the governing parameters and their significance. The experimental separation observations have been conducted on an inclined test tube with distributed <b>tapping</b> <b>points.</b> The test tube is 5 m long and is 0. 154 m in diameter, a size which minimizes diameter scaling-up to field applications scale. The tests were conducted at a low pressure with a mixture of two-phase, water and synthetic oil. In addition, certain experiments were conducted with low volumes of compressed air, simulating the small quantities of free gas flowing in and near the well. Variations of full scale separator length were studied by conducting an extensive matrix of test conditions on the short 5 m-tube. These tests results can be combined in a ”pancake” fashion to model the performance of a full-length separator. The core of the modeling is the establishment of an empirical drainage function per <b>tapping</b> <b>point</b> that relates the oil and water flow rates in the tube to the oil fraction obtained in the tapping stream. Once a single tapping performance is known and expressed in terms of separation efficiency, the total separator efficiency with multiple <b>tapping</b> <b>points</b> is calculated. The drainage function is based on a physical realization that there is a region, or a ”drainage volume” in the flow stream affected by the fluid withdrawal in the <b>tapping</b> <b>point.</b> The oil fraction in the tapping stream depends on this drainage volume and this dependency can be expressed by two factors; (a) the height above the draining point and, (b) a relationship that expresses how much oil is drained from each position vertically above the <b>tapping</b> <b>point.</b> These two relationships, which were established from the experimental results, were then used to assign a weighted oil contribution from each height {{from the bottom of the}} tube. When these weighted contributions are employed on the oil dispersion model, it calculates the compound effect of the dispersion and withdrawal to yield the tapping stream oil fraction. The dispersion model calculates the distribution of the fraction of each oil droplet-size class in the pipe cross section, and the distribution of the total oil fraction. The dispersion model is based on the balance of forces acting on oil droplets perpendicular to the flow direction. The applied forces are gravity, buoyancy, lift and turbulent dispersion. The model is unified. That is, it captures the oil distribution at all the observed flow patterns. The model has been used to study the effect of variation of the parameters that were kept constant in the experiments, such as water and oil density and interfacial tension and pipe diameter. In addition, the developed and tuned model has been tested for predicting separation efficiency in single and multiple tapping arrangements. The studied separation variables are; inlet rates of the fluids, inclination angle and diameter of the separation pipe, oil and water densities, interfacial tension, number of <b>tapping</b> <b>points</b> and distance between the <b>tapping</b> <b>points.</b> The results concluded that the flow pattern is the most significant factor affecting the separation performance. High separation efficiency is obtained for flow patterns with a water-rich bottom layer. This layer can be either upwards flowing, or a back-flowing film. The pipe inclination angle, the pipe diameter, water and oil densities and the interfacial tension are strongly affecting the flow patterns, and thus the separator performance. On the other hand, separation performance was not greatly affected by the drainage rate or the number of drainage points per section. Furthermore, as expected intuitively, the presence of air increases the turbulence and thus decreases the performance of the separation. However, it was also observed that in the presence of free gas, oil-water flow patterns with a thick, clear (transparent) and back-flowing water layer yielded better separation than the ones with upward flow films. In summary, the thesis provides a basic understanding of the process of separation in inclined flow using single and multiple tapping, gives information on the range of expected performance, and provides some fundamental knowledge for design and engineering of separators based on this principle.

40|$|Near {{real-time}} {{continuous monitoring}} {{systems have been}} proposed as a promising approach for helping drinking water utilities detect and respond quickly to threats related to the normal operation of the water network. Water quality sensors may detect contamination events that pose a growing threat to public health, while pressure and flow sensors are used for estimating the hydraulic state of the system. So far, optimization algorithms for the placement of sensor nodes in water networks were implemented separately for water quality and hydraulic applications. Deploying two independent sensor networks within one distribution system is not a cost-effective approach, since an in-line sensor <b>tapping</b> <b>point</b> is expensive to install and maintain, and is bounded by physical constraints such as limited access to underground pipelines and/or power sources.
