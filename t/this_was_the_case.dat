5|$|Music {{was also}} {{appreciated}} in Macedonia. In {{addition to the}} agora, the gymnasium, the theatre, and religious sanctuaries and temples dedicated to Greek gods and goddesses, {{one of the main}} markers of a true Greek city in the empire of Alexander the Great was the presence of an odeon for musical performances. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> not only for Alexandria in Egypt, but also cities as distant as Ai-Khanoum in what is now modern-day Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Originally to air on CBS with a {{start time}} of 2:30p.m. CST, CBS reassigned the game for primetime {{television}} at 7:00p.m. CST {{as part of a}} trade announced October 23. The deal with CBS involved swapping games to other networks and gave future scheduling considerations for the 2012 season to ESPN. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> as CBS used their allotted SEC primetime slot for the Alabama–Florida game earlier in the season.|$|E
5|$|The Persians were {{alerted to}} the {{withdrawal}} of the Greeks by a boat from Histiaea, but did not at first believe it. They sent some ships to see if <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> and finding that it was, the whole fleet set sail for Artemisium in the morning. The Persians then sailed on to Histiaea and sacked the surrounding region.|$|E

5|$|The first sponsor {{to appear}} on Malmö FF's jerseys was local {{shipyard}} company Kockums in 1976, and since 1981 at least one sponsor logo has appeared on the club's kits. In the mid-1990s it became commonplace for Swedish clubs to have several shirt sponsors. Malmö FF was no exception, and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> until 2010 when the club returned to having only one sponsor logo on their kit.|$|E
5|$|Water {{can also}} be sucked away from shore prior to a storm surge. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> on the western Florida coast in 2017, just before Hurricane Irma made landfall, {{uncovering}} land usually underwater. This phenomenon {{is known as a}} reverse storm surge, or a negative storm surge.|$|E
5|$|Although Roanoke {{has never}} had {{international}} passenger service, in 2001, the Airport Commission was prepared to change the airport's name to Roanoke International Airport. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> as the U.S. Customs Service increased the radius covered by the inland port in Dublin to include Roanoke. This expansion allowed for the airport to add customs officials to accommodate both international travel and cargo to pass through Roanoke's facilities. However, the renaming did not occur {{as a result of}} the economic downturn in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks. In 2007, the prospect of changing the airport's name was again mentioned as a possibility by the Airport Commission.|$|E

5|$|At Columbia, John R. Dunning {{believed}} that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> but Fermi {{was not so}} sure. The only way to settle this was to obtain a sample of uranium 235 and test it. He got Alfred O. C. Nier from the University of Minnesota to prepare samples of uranium enriched in uranium-234, 235 and 238 using a mass spectrometer. These were ready in February 1940, and Dunning, Eugene T. Booth and Aristid von Grosse then carried {{out a series of}} experiments. They demonstrated that uranium-235 was indeed primarily responsible for fission with slow neutrons, but were unable to determine precise neutron capture cross sections because their samples were not sufficiently enriched.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} his Thracian campaign, Philip moved {{against the}} city of Perinthos, {{formerly}} his ally. Diodorus says that this was because the city had begun to oppose him, and favour the Athenians; however, from Athenian sources, {{there is no indication that}} <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> One possible explanation is that Perinthos had refused to send aid to Philip during the Thracian campaign, and it was for this reason he decided to attack it. Either way, since Perinthos was a Greek city, Philip's actions gave the Athenian war-party the excuse it had been looking for to disrupt the peace Philip had wrought in Greece, thereby starting a new phase in the wars.|$|E
5|$|Carrick has {{represented}} England at under-18, under-21, B and senior levels. He made his England debut in 2001 {{and has since}} gained 34 caps but is yet to score an international goal. Carrick has often been overlooked during his England career, with Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, Paul Scholes, Gareth Barry and (for a brief time) Scott Parker preferred in his position. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> until the 2012–13 season, when Carrick {{established himself as a}} regular. He {{has been a member of}} the England squads for two major tournaments, the 2006 and 2010 World Cups.|$|E

5|$|In 1923, Compton {{moved to}} the University of Chicago as Professor of Physics, a {{position}} he would occupy for the next 22 years. In 1925, he demonstrated that the scattering of 130,000-volt X-rays from the first sixteen elements in the periodic table (hydrogen through sulfur) were polarized, a result predicted by J. J. Thomson. William Duane from Harvard University spearheaded an effort to prove that Compton's interpretation of the Compton effect was wrong. Duane carried {{out a series of}} experiments to disprove Compton, but instead found evidence that Compton was correct. In 1924, Duane conceded that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1930 Allison {{returned}} to the University of Chicago, where he became a professor in 1942, and the Frank P. Hixon Distinguished Service Professor of Physics in 1959. He studied the Compton effect and the dynamical theory of x-ray diffraction. At the time x-rays were an important means of investigating atomic structures, but the concept that light had both wave and particle properties, as demonstrated by Arthur Compton, was not universally accepted. William Duane from Harvard spearheaded an effort to prove that Compton's interpretation of the Compton effect was wrong, and Allison became part of this effort. Duane carried {{out a series of}} meticulous experiments to disprove Compton, but instead found overwhelming evidence that Compton was correct. To his credit, Duane conceded that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, WIN {{purchased}} two stations in South Australia, SES8 in Mount Gambier and RTS-5a in the Riverland region. They {{became known as}} WIN SA and until recently featured news bulletins presented from studios at both stations (bulletins are now presented from the set of studios in Mount Gambier). In 2002 supplementary licences were granted under Section 38A of the Broadcasting Services Act, allowing the network to launch additional channels, using the callsigns MGS in Mount Gambier and LRS in the Riverland, and known as WIN Ten, thus converting SES/RTS into the sole Nine affiliate for regional viewers in SA. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> until the affiliation moved to the Seven Network due to advertising problems with Nine's then owners in 2007.|$|E

5|$|Maunsell’'s successor, Oliver Bulleid, {{oversaw the}} {{building}} of twenty {{members of the class}} at Eastleigh railway works between January 1938 and September 1939. Bulleid is reported to have found the Q Class uninspiring, having been manufactured to traditional Victorian principles of locomotive design, and is said to have stated that the order for the Q Class would have been cancelled if he had been appointed CME earlier. However, Bulleid had ample opportunity either to cancel the order or to build and test a single prototype, without incurring the expense of building twenty members of the class, if <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 15 February 1500, Cabral was {{appointed}} Capitão-mor (literally Major-Captain, or commander-in-chief) of a fleet sailing for India. It {{was then the}} custom for the Portuguese Crown to appoint nobles to naval and military commands, regardless of experience or professional competence. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for the captains of the ships under Cabral's command—most were nobles like himself. The practice had obvious pitfalls, since authority could as easily be given to highly incompetent and unfit people as it could fall to talented leaders such as Afonso de Albuquerque or Dom João de Castro.|$|E
5|$|On December 4, 2011, {{the final}} Bowl Championship Series standings were {{unveiled}} with LSU ranked first, followed by Alabama, {{to set up}} a rematch between the two teams in the 2012 BCS National Championship Game. In the weeks that led up to the game, the notion of a split national championship became a major storyline. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> as the AP Poll is not tied to the Bowl Championship Series and some AP voters expressed they might vote LSU national champions even if they lost as they defeated Alabama in their regular season game. However, after Alabama shut out LSU 21–0 in the BCS National Championship Game, the AP voted them national champions to give the Crimson Tide the consensus national championship and thus avoid a split title with LSU.|$|E

5|$|One temnospondyl, the dvinosaur Trimerorhachis, {{may have}} brooded young {{in an area}} between the gills called the {{pharyngeal}} pouch. Small bones belonging to younger Trimerorhachis individuals {{have been found in}} these pouches. The living Darwin's Frog is also a mouth brooder and would be the closest modern analogue to Trimerorhachis if it cared for its young in this way. An alternative possibility is that Trimerorhachis was cannibalistic, eating its young like many amphibians do today. If <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> the bones of these smaller individuals were originally located in the throat and were pushed into the pharyngeal pouch as the animal fossilized.|$|E
5|$|The Alpha tracks {{began to}} suspend {{operations}} on 4 September 1945, and ceased operation completely on 22 September. The last two Beta tracks went into full operation in November and December, processing feed from K-25 {{and the new}} K-27. By May 1946, studies suggested that the gaseous plants could fully enrich the uranium by themselves without accidentally creating a critical mass. After a trial showed <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> Groves ordered all but one Beta track at Y-12 shut down in December 1946. Y-12 remained in use for nuclear weapons processing and materials storage. A production facility for the hydrogen bomb used in Operation Castle in 1954 was hastily installed in 1952.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} Zenobia's {{territorial}} control during her early reign is debated; according to historian Fergus Millar, her authority {{was confined to}} Palmyra and Emesa until 270. If <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> the events of 270 (which saw Zenobia's conquest of the Levant and Egypt) are extraordinary. It {{is more likely that}} the queen ruled the territories controlled by her late husband, a view supported by Southern and historian , and backed by ancient sources (such as the Roman historian Eutropius, who wrote that the queen inherited her husband's power). The Augustan History also mentioned that Zenobia took control of the East during Gallienus' reign. Further evidence of extended territorial control was a statement by the Byzantine historian Zosimus, who wrote that the queen had a residence in Antioch.|$|E
