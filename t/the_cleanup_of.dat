The manufacture of radiation-treated hardwood flooring continued until 2002. Pennsylvania reacquired the land in 1963 and 1967, and in 1965 established Quehanna as a wild area, albeit one with a nuclear facility and industrial complex. <b>The</b> <b>cleanup</b> <b>of</b> the reactor and hot cells took over eight years and cost $30million; the facility was demolished and its nuclear license terminated in 2009. Since 1992 the industrial complex has been home to Quehanna Motivational Boot Camp, a minimum-security prison.

5|$|Although the 25th Division {{generally}} {{was under}} less pressure from North Korean units after September 5, {{there were still}} severe local attacks. On September 6, 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry, moved north from the Haman area to join 2nd Battalion in <b>the</b> <b>cleanup</b> <b>of</b> North Korean troops behind the 35th Infantry and below the Nam River. Caught between the 35th Infantry on its hill positions along {{the river and the}} attacking 27th Infantry units, large numbers of North Koreans were killed. Sixteen different groups reportedly were dispersed with heavy casualties during the day. By morning of September 7 there was clear evidence that survivors of the NK 7th Division were trying to escape across the Nam River. However the North Koreans launched another attack against the 35th Infantry, which it quickly repulsed. The 25th Infantry Division buried more than 2,000 North Korean dead, killed between September 1 and 7 behind its lines. This number did not include those killed in front of its positions.|$|E
5|$|The storm also {{affected}} the United Kingdom {{as it moved}} across the southern portion of the country. In Wales, Charley produced record-breaking daily rainfall, which surpassed 4inches (100mm) in Dyfed. Some locations received hundred-year rainfall. The storm struck the area during the Late Summer Bank Holiday, creating unfavorable conditions for driving and resulting in several accidents. Heavy rainfall flooded rivers, which swept away several people. This prompted officials to deploy boats and helicopters to assist in rescues, although at least three deaths were reported due to drowning in the rivers. Severe flooding was reported in Cumbria and Gloucestershire. The storm also left roads blocked by fallen trees and power lines. At {{the start of the}} storm, the inaugural Birmingham Super Prix motorsport race was just getting underway but poor visibility from precipitation contributed to an accident which temporarily called halt to proceedings. In Whitland, Wales, local soldiers assisted rescuing people, and later contributed to <b>the</b> <b>cleanup</b> <b>of</b> the town. Throughout the country, five people were missing after the storm, all of whom are presumed to have drowned; an additional death was confirmed in Newry, Northern Ireland.|$|E
