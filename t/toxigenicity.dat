40|$|The {{conversion}} to <b>toxigenicity</b> of nontoxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae strain C 4 requires the active and continued participation {{of a specific}} bacteriophage (Groman, 1953, 1955). The facts supporting this statement are: (1) lysogenization with 3 phage results in a simultaneous change to <b>toxigenicity,</b> and (2) reversion of toxngemnc cells to the nonlysogenic state results in {{a return to the}} nontoxigenic state. The phage specificity in the conversion phenomenon is demonstrated by the isolation of a phage designated y, capable of lysogenizing C 4 without converting it to toxi-genicity. In the present work the serological re-lationship of,B and y phage is described, as well as their interactions with host strain C 4. Ap-parent recombination between, and y phage is reported in which the ability of, phage to con-vert to <b>toxigenicity</b> acts as a discrete genetic attribute of the phage.

40|$|Evolutionary theory may {{contribute}} to practical solutions for control of disease by identifying inter-ventions that may cause pathogens to evolve to reduced virulence. Theory predicts, for example, that pathogens transmitted by water or arthropod vectors should evolve to relatively high levels of virulence because such pathogens can gain the evolutionary benefits of relatively high levels of host exploitation while paying little price from host illness. The entrance of Vibrio cholerae into South America in 1991 has generated a natural experiment that allows testing of this idea by determining whether geographic and temporal variations in <b>toxigenicity</b> correspond to variation in the potential for waterborne trans-mission. Preliminary studies show such correspondences: <b>toxigenicity</b> is negatively associated with access to uncontaminated water in Brazil; and in Chile, where the potential for waterborne transmis-sion is particularly low, <b>toxigenicity</b> of strains declined between 1991 and 1998.

40|$|Abstract Background Health {{risk from}} {{exposure}} of perfluorochemicals (PFCs) to wildlife and human {{has been a}} subject of great interest for understanding their molecular mechanism of toxicity. Although much work has been done, the <b>toxigenicity</b> of PFCs remains largely unknown. In this work, the non-covalent interactions between perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and serum albumin (SA) and DNA were investigated under normal physiological conditions, aiming to elucidate the <b>toxigenicity</b> of PFCs. Results In equilibrium dialysis assay, the bindings of PFOS to SA correspond to the Langmuir isothermal model with two-step sequence model. The saturation binding number of PFOS was 45 per molecule of SA and 1 per three base-pairs of DNA, respectively. ITC results showed that all the interactions were spontaneous driven by entropy change. Static quenching of the fluorescence of SA was observed when interacting with PFOS, indicating PFOS bound Trp residue of SA. CD spectra of SA and DNA changed obviously {{in the presence of}} PFOS. At normal physiological conditions, 1. 2 mmol/l PFOS reduces the binding ratio of Vitamin B 2 to SA by more than 30 %. Conclusion The ion bond, van der Waals force and hydrophobic interaction contributed to PFOS binding to peptide chain of SA and to the groove bases of DNA duplex. The non-covalent interactions of PFOS with SA and DNA alter their secondary conformations, with the physiological function of SA to transport Vitamin B 2 being inhibited consequently. This work provides a useful experimental method for further studying the <b>toxigenicity</b> of PFCs. </p...|$|E

This dissertation explores three major dimensions of life which are important to the biogeography and <b>toxigenicity</b> of Pseudo-nitzschia, employing methods of culturing, genetic fragment analysis techniques, collection of standard oceanographic data, and in silico analysis of publicly available DNA sequences. First, we report species-specific bacterial communities associated with Pseudo-nitzschia cultures; furthermore, these communities varied according to culture <b>toxigenicity.</b> Second, Pseudo-nitzschia communities were responsible for moderate DA levels in the northern Benguela Upwelling Zone, potentially caused by species previously reported as very weakly toxigenic. Throughout the South Atlantic Ocean, novel and known Pseudo-nitzschia types were detected, with communities exhibiting biogeographic patterns that varied with abiotic ocean conditions. Third, newly constructed nuclear- and chloroplast-based phylogenies suggest the existence of two major Pseudo-nitzschia clades, which exhibit similar morphological and physiological characters.

Enterotoxin plasmids from serotypes such as O 6, O 25, O 27, O 126, O 128, and O 159, which are frequently associated with E. coli diarrhea (classical strains) generally did not transfer by conjugation from clinical isolates, whereas those from serotypes such as O 7, O 17, O 80, O 98, O 139, O 150, and O 153, which are rarely associated with diarrhea (rare strains) transferred almost always from the clinical isolates by conjugation. Analyses of enterotoxin plasmids by restriction endonucleases and DNA-DNA hybridization with the enterotoxin probes revealed that the strains with the same O serotype and <b>toxigenicity</b> carry closely related enterotoxin plasmids.

40|$|In a {{previous}} report (Groman, 1953 a) {{it was concluded}} that toxigenic Corynebacterium diph-theriae which are recovered following exposure of a nontoxigenic strain to specific bacteriophage result from a direct conversion to toxigenicity' rather than from selection of toxigenic mutants. This conclusion was supported and strengthened by the work of Barksdale and Pappenheimer (1954) in their study of the same phage-host system. It has been proposed as a working hypothesis (Groman, 1953 a) that conversion to <b>toxigenicity</b> is a direct consequence of the establishment of the lysogenic state. This proposal was based primarily on the one-to-one relationship existing between <b>toxigenicity</b> and lysogenicity under all conditions including those in which selection by phage was inoperative.
