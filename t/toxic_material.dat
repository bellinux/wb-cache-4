A normal dive will end with some pressure remaining in the cylinder; if an emergency ascent has been made due to an out-of-gas incident, the cylinder will normally still contain some pressure and unless the cylinder had been submerged deeper than where the last gas was used it is not possible for water to get in during the dive.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{will destroy}} the highest-priority chemicals, which were {{scheduled}} for removal from Syria by 31 December, {{on board the}} MV Cape Ray in international waters of the Mediterranean, using an U.S. Army Field Deployable Hydrolysis System. The United Kingdom gave the United States £2.5 million of specialist equipment and training to enable the highest-priority chemicals to be processed more quickly. In addition around 150 tonnes of priority two chemicals, <b>toxic</b> <b>material</b> similar to industrial chemical agents, will be transported to the UK {{with the help of}} the British Royal Navy and destroyed there. The remaining stock of priority two chemicals not going to Britain will be destroyed by commercial companies.|$|E

25|$|Sentinel {{cells in}} Dictyostelium discoideum are {{phagocytic}} cells responsible for removing <b>toxic</b> <b>material</b> from the slug {{stage of the}} social cycle. Generally round in shape, these cells are present within the slug sheath where they {{are found to be}} circulating freely. The detoxification process occurs when these cells engulf toxins and pathogens within the slug through phagocytosis. Then, the cells clump into groups of five to ten cells, which then attach to the inner sheath of the slug. The sheath is sloughed off as the slug migrates to a new site in search of food bacteria.|$|E

25|$|The Alberta Cancer Board {{published}} {{research of the}} cancer rates of those living in Fort Chipewyan, Alberta in 2009. While many companies argue {{that there are not}} enough chemicals and <b>toxic</b> <b>material</b> in the water due {{to the development of the}} oil sands, this report indicates that there is coincidentally a significantly higher rate of cancer within this community. There have been many speculations as to why there is a higher rate of cancer in this community; some of those speculations are contamination with the river and the oil sands as well as uranium mining that is currently in progress. The world’s largest production of uranium is produced in this area as well as along the Athabasca River, allowing for easy contamination of the river.|$|E
500|$|It was {{reported}} in October 2007 that 838 people had completed the program. The clinic displayed towels with colored stains, as evidence that <b>toxic</b> <b>material</b> had been sweated out in the saunas. According to its Director, Jim Woodworth, during the Purification Rundown firefighters had passed odd-colored bowel movements and sweated out mercury, aluminium and magnesium. The Fire Department's chief medical officer, Dr. Kerry Kelly, criticized the lack of objective evidence, saying, [...] "I have trouble believing in these purple-stained towels." ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{plants have}} {{developed}} effective defences against termites. However, seedlings {{are vulnerable to}} termite attacks and need additional protection, as their defence mechanisms only develop when they have passed the seedling stage. Defence is typically achieved by secreting antifeedant chemicals into the woody cell walls. This reduces the ability of termites to efficiently digest the cellulose. A commercial product, [...] "Blockaid", has been developed in Australia that uses a range of plant extracts to create a paint-on nontoxic termite barrier for buildings. An extract of a species of Australian figwort, Eremophila, {{has been shown to}} repel termites; tests have shown that termites are strongly repelled by the <b>toxic</b> <b>material</b> {{to the extent that they}} will starve rather than consume the food. When kept close to the extract, they become disoriented and eventually die.|$|E

2500|$|Historian Christian Destremau {{points out}} that the cargo {{contained}} no such quantities of <b>toxic</b> <b>material,</b> but only poison capsules, probably to be of service in attempts to liquidate locals believed to be collaborating with the Mandatory Authorities. According to MI5 files, the parachutists brought three types of poison to Palestine : some suicide pills for themselves, six tubes of powder to put tracking dogs off their scent (they didn't realise this was poisonous and kept it with their food) and an envelope of [...] "arseneous oxide". Regarding these latest, Wieland said that the mufti insisted it be brought for the purpose of eliminating Arab traitors but Latif denied it was the mufti's idea. The 400-page files do not mention any intention to poison population or enough quantities for such a plan.|$|E
