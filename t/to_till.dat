5|$|The kingdom {{was divided}} into provinces named Nadu, Vishaya, Kampana and Desha, listed in {{descending}} order of geographical size. Each province had a local governing body consisting of a minister (Mahapradhana) and a treasurer (Bhandari) that reported to the ruler of that province (Dandanayaka). Under this local ruler were officials called Heggaddes and Gavundas who hired and supervised the local farmers and labourers recruited <b>to</b> <b>till</b> the land. Subordinate ruling clans such as Alupas continued to govern their respective territories while following the policies set by the empire.|$|E
5|$|There were varying {{types of}} land {{ownership}} and tenure {{depending on the}} topography and climate of one's locality. In hilly, peripheral areas far from trade routes, most peasant farmers owned and cultivated their own fields. In frontier regions such as Hunan and Sichuan, owners of wealthy estates gathered serfs <b>to</b> <b>till</b> their lands. The most advanced areas had few estates with serfs tilling the fields; these regions had long fostered wet-rice cultivation, which did not require centralized management of farming. Landlords set fixed rents for tenant farmers in these regions, while independent small farming families also owned their own lots.|$|E
5|$|Historians are {{now turning}} to local gazetteers of Ming China for clues {{that would show}} {{consistent}} growth in population. Using the gazetteers, Brook estimates that the overall population under the Chenghua Emperor (r. 1464–1487) was roughly 75 million, despite mid-Ming census figures hovering around 62 million. While prefectures across the empire in the mid-Ming period were reporting either a drop in or stagnant population size, local gazetteers reported massive amounts of incoming vagrant workers with not enough good cultivated land for them <b>to</b> <b>till,</b> so that many would become drifters, conmen, or wood-cutters that contributed to deforestation. The Hongzhi and Zhengde emperors lessened the penalties against those who had fled their home region, while the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–67) finally had officials register migrants wherever they had moved or fled {{in order to bring}} in more revenues.|$|E

25|$|The general {{strength}} of the wartime army varied greatly depending {{on a number of}} factors: the authority of the king, the population of the territories he controlled, and the season of year. Because most of the conscripts were farmers, most wars were fought during the dry season. The famous Forty Years' War was largely fought during the dry season, and armies went back <b>to</b> <b>till</b> the land during the rainy season. Only a few times in the imperial era was the decision to extend the campaign to the rainy season made, most notables being the First Anglo-Burmese War and the Burmese–Siamese War (1765–1767).|$|E

[...] An Emmett Till Memorial Commission {{was established in the}} early 21st century. The Sumner County Courthouse was restored and includes the Emmett Till Interpretive Center.

Author William Faulkner, a prominent white Mississippi native who often focused on racial issues, wrote two essays on Till: one before the trial in which he pleaded for American unity and one after, a piece titled [...] "On Fear" [...] that was published in Harper's in 1956.

2500|$|The [...] "Gregory clause" [...] of the Poor Law, {{named after}} William H. Gregory, M.P., {{prohibited}} anyone who held at least [...] of an acre (0.1 ha) from receiving relief. In practice, this meant that, if a farmer, having sold all his produce to pay rent and taxes, should be reduced, as {{many thousands of}} them were, to applying for public outdoor relief, he would not get it until he had first delivered up all his land to the landlord. Of this Law, Mitchel wrote that [...] "it is the able-bodied idler only who is to be fed—if he attempted <b>to</b> <b>till</b> but one rood of ground, he dies." [...] This simple method of ejectment was called [...] "passing paupers through the workhouse"—a man went in, a pauper came out.

Hong Kong citizens expressed concerns that the pregnant women and anchor babies put heavier burden on Hong Kong's medical system. Some of them even called mainland people [...] "locusts" [...] which take away Hong Kong's resources from locals. Over 170,000 new births where both parents were mainland people between 2001 and 2011, of which 32,653 were born in 2010.

2500|$|The harsh postwar {{crackdown}} on remnants of capitalism in the South {{led to the}} collapse of the economy during the 1980s. With the economy in shambles, the communist government altered its course and adopted consensus policies that bridged the divergent views of pragmatists and communist traditionalists. Throughout the 1980s, Vietnam received nearly $3 billion a year in economic and military aid from the Soviet Union and conducted most of its trade with the USSR and other Comecon countries. In 1986, Nguyễn Văn Linh, who was elevated to CPV general secretary the following year, launched a campaign for political and economic renewal (Đổi Mới). His policies were characterized by political and economic experimentation that was similar to simultaneous reform agenda undertaken in the Soviet Union. Reflecting the spirit of political compromise, Vietnam phased out its reeducation effort. The communist government stopped promoting agricultural and industrial cooperatives. Farmers were permitted <b>to</b> <b>till</b> private plots alongside state-owned land, and in 1990 the communist government passed a law encouraging the establishment of private businesses.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of Catherine’s reign, the landowning noble class owned the serfs, who were bound to the land [...] they tilled. Children of serfs were born into serfdom and worked the same land their parents had. The serfs had very limited rights, {{but they were not}} exactly slaves. While the state did not {{technically}} allow them to own possessions, some serfs were able to accumulate enough wealth to pay for their freedom. The understanding of law in imperial Russia by all sections of society was often weak, confused, or nonexistent, particularly in the provinces where most serfs lived. This is why some serfs were able to do things such as accumulate wealth. To become serfs, people would give up their freedoms to a landowner in exchange for their protection and support in times of hardship. In addition, they would receive land <b>to</b> <b>till,</b> but would be taxed a certain percentage of their crops to give to their landowners. These were the privileges a serf was entitled to and that nobles were bound to carry out. All of this was true before Catherine’s reign, and this is the system she inherited.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), before any shrub or grass had yet sprouted on earth, and before God had sent rain for the earth, a flow would well {{up from the}} ground to water the earth.

God planted a garden in the east in Eden, caused to grow there every good and {{pleasing}} tree, and placed the tree of life and the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil {{in the middle of the}} garden. A river issued from Eden to water the garden, and then divided into four branches: the Pishon, which winds through Havilah, where the gold is; the Gihon, which winds through Cush; the Tigris, which flows east of Asshur; and the Euphrates. God placed the man in the garden of Eden <b>to</b> <b>till</b> and tend it, and freed him to eat from every tree of the garden, except for the tree of knowledge of good and evil, warning that if the man ate of it, he would surely die. Announcing that it was not good for man to be alone and that God would make for him a fitting helper, God formed out of the earth all the beasts and birds and brought them to the man to name.
