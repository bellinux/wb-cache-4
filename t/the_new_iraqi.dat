5|$|From the nationalists' {{point of}} view, the Assyrian Levies were British proxies {{to be used}} by their 'masters' to destroy <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Iraqi</b> state whose {{independence}} the British had consistently opposed. The British allowed their Assyrian auxiliary troops to retain their arms and granted them special duty and privileges: guarding military air installations and receiving higher pay than the Iraqi Arab recruits. Under British protection, the Assyrian Levies did not become Iraqi citizens after until 1924. The nationalists believed the British were hoping for the Assyrians to destroy Iraq's internal cohesion by becoming independent and by inciting others such as the Kurds to follow their example.|$|E

During its year of deployment, the brigade {{established}} Prisoner of War holding areas for over 3,600 Iraqi prisoners and conducted main supply route patrolling over 2,500 kilometers in southern Iraq. The Brigade entered Baghdad in April 2003 and began establishing <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Police Service and rebuilding Iraqi police stations. From {{the beginning of}} Operation Iraqi Freedom until February 2004 the Brigade provided command and control for seven Military Police battalions, one Mechanized Infantry battalion, 30 Military Police companies, and two Law and Order detachments. The Brigade’s MPs conducted over 24,000 combat patrols, apprehended over 2,400 criminals, confiscated 7,500 illegal weapons, and trained over 10,000 Iraqi police officers. During their deployment, the Brigade recovered several precious artifacts, such as the Mask of Warka, which was recovered on 23 September 2003. The brigade returned to Sandhofen in 2004 only to return to Iraq in 2007.|$|E

25|$|The fall of Baghdad saw the {{outbreak}} of regional, sectarian violence throughout the country, as Iraqi tribes and cities began to fight each other over old grudges. The Iraqi cities of Al-Kut and Nasiriyah launched attacks on each other immediately following the fall of Baghdad to establish dominance in the new country, and the U.S.-led Coalition quickly found themselves embroiled in a potential civil war. U.S.-led Coalition forces ordered the cities to cease hostilities immediately, explaining that Baghdad would remain the capital of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Iraqi</b> government. Nasiriyah responded favorably and quickly backed down; however, Al-Kut placed snipers on the main roadways into town, with orders that invading forces were not to enter the city. After several minor skirmishes, the snipers were removed, but tensions and violence between regional, city, tribal, and familial groups continued.|$|E

In central Baghdad, a car bomb and roadside bomb killed four Iraqi civilians and wounded 10 near the Interior Ministry complex.

25|$|In 1958, Mustafa Barzani and his fighters {{returned}} to Iraq from exile, and an {{attempt was made}} to negotiate Kurdish autonomy in the north with <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Iraqi</b> administration of Gen. Qasim. The negotiations ultimately failed and the First Iraqi–Kurdish War erupted on 11 September 1961, lasting until 1970 and inflicting 75,000–105,000 casualties. Despite the attempts to resolve the conflict by providing Kurds with a recognized autonomy in north Iraq (Iraqi Kurdistan), the negotiations failed in 1974, resulting in resumed hostilities known as the Second Iraqi–Kurdish War, which resulted in the collapse of the Kurdish militias and the reconquest of northern Iraq by Iraqi government troops. As a result, Mustafa Barzani and most of the KDP leadership fled to Iran, while PUK gained power in the vacuum, leading an insurgency campaign against the central Iraqi government. Since 1976 PUK and KDP relations quickly deteriorated, reaching the climax in April 1978, when PUK troops suffered a major defeat by KDP, which had the support of Iranian and Iraqi air forces. During this period, the Ba'athist authorities took the opportunity to perform large-scale displacement and colonization projects in North Iraq, aiming to shift demographics and thus distabilize Kurdish power bases.|$|E

A transitional unity agreement stipulating a federal system was signed by the parties on 17 April and the new union was set to be established in May 1965. However, the agreement fell apart weeks later when Syria's Ba'athists purged Nasser's supporters from the officers corps.

The U.S. Army had wanted the Iraqi troops retained, as they knew the locals and could maintain order, but Bremer refused as he felt that they could be disloyal. However, many former Iraqi soldiers, many with extended families to support, then decided that their best chance for a future was to join a militia force. The huge arms depots were available for pillaging by anyone who wanted weapons and explosives, so the former Iraqi soldiers converged on the military stockpiles. The U.S. knew about the location of weapon caches, but said that it lacked the troops to secure them; ironically, these arms would later be used against <b>the</b> Americans and <b>new</b> <b>Iraqi</b> government forces.|$|R

2500|$|The Iraqi Air Force {{was founded}} in 1931, during British control of Iraq after {{the defeat of the}} Ottoman Empire in WW1, with only a few pilots. Aside from a brief period during the Second World War, the Iraqi Air Force {{operated}} mostly British aircraft until the 14 July Revolution in 1958, when <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Iraqi</b> government began increased diplomatic relationships with the Soviet Union. The air force used both Soviet and British aircraft throughout the 1950s and 1960s. When Saddam Hussein came to power in 1979, the air force grew very quickly when Iraq ordered more Soviet and French aircraft. Its peak came after the long and bloody Iran–Iraq War, which ended in 1988, when it consisted of 1029 aircraft of all types (of which 550 were combat ready), becoming the largest air force in the region. Its downfall came during the Gulf War (1990–91) and continued while coalition forces enforced no-fly zones. The remains of Iraq's air force were destroyed during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{key events}} {{in the life of}} <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Republic {{occurred}} during the deployment of the 1–206th FA, the return to Iraqi sovereignty in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546 on 28 June 2004, and the first Iraqi National Elections on 30 January 2005. The 39th BCT was instrumental in the January 2005 elections. The battalion was responsible for working with the 307th ING Battalion to establish and secure six different polling sites within the battalion's area of operations. In order to avoid jeopardizing the credibility of the election process, it was necessary to avoid a United States Military presence at the polling sites. This meant that the security at the polling sites would be the responsibility of 307th ING Battalion alone. Battalion leaders spent countless hours planning and coordination with Iraqi counterparts and governmental elections officials. The task at one polling site was even more complicated. Over 3000 Iraqi army soldiers living on the Iraqi side of Camp Taji wished to vote, but in order to prevent a perception of military control of the ballot box, it was determined that these soldiers would have to vote outside the camp at the village of Assyria, and they would be unarmed. [...] This obviously presented a very lucrative target for insurgents.|$|E

50|$|On 11 October 1920, Percy Cox {{returned}} to Baghdad {{and asked her}} to continue as Oriental Secretary, acting as liaison with the forthcoming Arab government. Gertrude Bell essentially played the role of mediator between the Arab government and British officials. Bell often had to mediate between the various groups of Iraq including a majority population of Shias in the southern region, Sunnis in central Iraq, and the Kurds, mostly in the northern region, who wished to be autonomous. Keeping these groups united was essential for political balance in Iraq and for British imperial interests. Iraq not only contained valuable resources in oil but would act as a buffer zone, with the help of Kurds in the north as a standing army in the region to protect against Turkey, Persia (Iran), and Syria. British officials in London, especially Churchill, were highly concerned about cutting heavy costs in the colonies, including the cost of quashing tribal infighting. Another important project for both <b>the</b> British and <b>new</b> <b>Iraqi</b> rulers was creating a new identity for these people so that they would identify themselves as one nation.|$|R
