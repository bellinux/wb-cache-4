Gregg noticed a high incidence of congenital cataracts in infants arriving at his surgery – two to three times the normal rate that would be expected from hereditary factors. He overheard a conversation between several mothers whose babies had cataracts, in which they mentioned that they had suffered from German measles (rubella) during pregnancy. Investigating <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> of children with similar conditions, Gregg discovered that out of 78 affected children, 68 had been exposed to rubella in utero. There had been an outbreak of rubella and meningitis in Australian army camps in 1941, which had been transmitted to the wider community when the men returned to their families.|$|E
25|$|One of Harvey's major {{tasks as}} Health Minister was {{to deal with}} the government's {{response}} to the growing AIDS crisis. The issue had been essentially ignored under Bjelke-Petersen, but under the more moderate Ahern, Harvey was tasked with taking steps to begin to address the disease. To this extent, she oversaw the legalisation of condom vending machines and needle exchanges, and instituted a program of AIDS education in schools. These steps were seen by some as inadequate, and her role was undermined by her poor relationship with the homosexual community. These issues came to a head in March 1988 when Harvey put out a departmental memo insisting that she be given unrestricted access to <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> of AIDS patients, sparking a bitter battle over patient confidentiality, and repeated Opposition calls for her to be removed from the portfolio.|$|E
