More importantly, the medical, sociological, and behavioural criteria were equally reliable (i.e. highly correlated).

500|$|According to Casting Crowns' lead vocalist Mark Hall, {{the concept}} for Come to the Well is the song [...] "The Well". Hall wrote the song {{based on the}} Biblical story of [...] "woman at the well {{and the fact that}} she was {{standing}} there talking to Jesus about water and Jesus was talking to her about water, but they weren't <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> water". Hall noted that, in his life, [...] "when I come to Jesus, I've already got my well figured out, I've already got what I think is going to sustain me, I just need him to sprinkle some magic Jesus dust on it and make it work. We have our wells figured and we want Jesus to fix our wells, but our wells are really holes in the ground". Hall argued that instead of using that approach, Christians should [...] "start with Jesus, then we go to the world", and said that approach is what the album is about. In writing the album, Hall worked with outside songwriters Steven Curtis Chapman, Matthew West, and Tom Douglas on several tracks; he received writing credit on eleven out of the album's twelve tracks, the exception being [...] "Face Down", which was penned by Hector Cervantes and Marc Byrd.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the September 11, 2001 attacks, the names of the hijackers were released. There was some confusion regarding who Mohamed Atta was, and cases of mistaken identity. Initially, Mohamed Atta's identity was confused with that of a native Jordanian, Mahmoud Mahmoud Atta, who bombed an Israeli bus in the West Bank in 1986, killing one and severely injuring three. Mahmoud Atta was 14 years older than Atta. Mahmoud Atta, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was subsequently deported from Venezuela to the United States, extradited to Israel, tried and sentenced to life in prison. The Israeli Supreme Court later overturned his extradition and set him free. After 9/11, there also were reports stating that Mohamed Atta had attended International Officers School at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama. The Washington Post quoted a United States Air Force official who explained, [...] "discrepancies in their biographical data, such as birth dates 20 years off, indicate we are probably not <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> people." ...|$|E
40|$|It {{is easier}} for voters to make {{informed}} electoral choices when parties <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> issues. Yet parties may decide against such ‘issue engagement’. We hypothesize that issue engagement between parties is more likely (a) when the similarity of their policy positions means that both parties have clear electoral incentives to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> topics and (b) when parties face few organizational constraints in terms of campaign resources. Our empirical analysis of 2, 453 press releases by Austrian parties shows that ideological proximity and party resources affect the level of issue engagement. These findings suggest that issue engagement is less likely precisely where it is needed most, which {{has important implications for}} understanding the democratic quality of election campaigns.

60|$|The madman is not he that {{defies the}} world. The saint, the criminal, the martyr, the cynic, the nihilist may all defy the world quite sanely. And even if such fanatics {{would destroy the}} world, the world owes them a {{strictly}} fair trial according to proof and public law. But the madman is not the man who defies the world; {{he is the man}} who denies it. Suppose we are all standing round a field and looking at a tree in the middle of it. It is perfectly true that we all see it (as the decadents say) in infinitely different aspects: that is not the point; the point is that we all say it is a tree. Suppose, if you will, that we are all poets, which seems improbable; so that each of us could turn his aspect into a vivid image distinct from a tree. Suppose one says it looks like a green cloud and another like a green fountain, and a third like a green dragon and the fourth like a green cheese. The fact remains: that they all say it looks like these things. It is a tree. Nor are any of the poets in the least mad because of any opinions they may form, however frenzied, about the functions or future of the tree. A conservative poet may wish to clip the tree; a revolutionary poet may wish to burn it. An optimist poet may want to make it a Christmas tree and hang candles on it. A pessimist poet may want to hang himself on it. None of these are mad, because they are all <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing. But there is another man who is talking horribly about something else. There is a monstrous exception to mankind. Why he is so we know not; a new theory says it is heredity; an older theory says it is devils. But in any case, the spirit of it is the spirit that denies, the spirit that really denies realities. This is the man who looks at the tree and does not say it looks like a lion, but says that it is a lamp-post.|$|E

50|$|A {{general and}} {{intuitive}} description is that {{words in a}} semantic field are not necessarily synonymous, but are all used to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> general phenomenon. Synonymy requires the sharing of a sememe or seme, but the semantic field is a larger area surrounding those. A meaning of a word is dependent partly on its relation to other words in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> conceptual area. <b>The</b> kinds of semantic fields vary from culture to culture and anthropologists use them to study belief systems and reasoning across cultural groups.|$|R

Furthermore, both novels <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> king: pharaoh Sneferu. The Papyrus pAthen contains the phrase: [...] "...for these are the wise who can move waters and make a river flow at their mere will and want...", which clearly refers to the wonder that the magicians Djadjaemankh and Dedi had performed in pWestcar.|$|R
