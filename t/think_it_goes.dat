The court martial went into an in camera session while sensitive evidence was being heard. Lody claimed that he had asked in August to be erased from military service on the grounds of poor health and to be allowed to travel to the United States. This was refused, he went on, but a member of naval intelligence whom he had previously never met coaxed him into undertaking a mission in the UK on the condition that he could go to the US afterwards. Lody told the tribunal that he was not pressured but that [...] "I have never been a coward in my life and I certainly would not be a shirker", and that he had persisted with his mission because [...] "once a man has promised to do a thing he does it, that is the understanding." [...] His services were provided [...] "absolutely as an honour and free", while he had never intended to be a spy: [...] "I was pressed for secret service, but not as a spy– oh, no. If that would have been mentioned to me at Berlin I surely would have refused. The word in the sentence, I do not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> together." [...] He claimed that he had [...] "pledged my word of honour" [...] not to name his controller.|$|E

60|$|The lecturers are {{exceedingly}} important {{servants of}} Mrs. Eddy, and she chooses them with great care. Each {{of them has}} an appointed territory in which to perform his duties--in the North, the South, the East, the West, in Canada, in Great Britain, and so on--and each must stick to his own territory and not forage beyond its boundaries. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> without saying--from {{what we have seen}} of Mrs. Eddy--that no lecture is delivered until she has examined and approved it, and that the lecturer is not allowed to change it afterwards.|$|E

I don’t like a lot of rules, and I like big, open worlds. Some might say the economy systems play a role in that, but I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> much deeper than that. I think many folks will see our upcoming Kings and Castles game as a continuing extension of those previous RTS titles." ...|$|E

I hate it when people 'confess' or 'reveal' their sexuality and also things can change for people over the years. So it is about the person but I also <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> beyond that.

50|$|The {{second story}} {{the song is}} based on, {{involved}} a student that Vedder knew from his junior high school in San Diego, California. He elaborated further in a 1991 interview: I actually knew somebody in junior high school, in San Diego, California, that did the same thing, just about, didn't take his life but ended up shooting up an oceanography room. I remember being in the halls and hearing it and I had actually had altercations with this kid in the past. I {{was kind of a}} rebellious fifth-grader and I think we got in fights and stuff. So it's a bit about this kid named Jeremy and it's also a bit about a kid named Brian that I knew and I don't know...the song, I think it says a lot. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> somewhere...and a lot of people interpret it different ways and it's just been recently that I've been talking about the true meaning behind it and I hope no one's offended and believe me, I think of Jeremy when I sing it.|$|E
5000|$|I {{called it}} Gone Away Backward because it's {{a phrase from}} the Bible… I {{stumbled}} on the phrase later {{in the evolution of}} the record when I was looking around for a title. I think it's a nice piquant phrase that has three good, strong, mellifluous words in it. As far as the backwardness of the record, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> backward in terms of nostalgia for the past - bittersweet nostalgia for the past - as well as the recession having knocked everything backwards for people. In that sense, it's not an album about the past, it's an album about now. [...] "Interview with Robbie Fulks about 'Gone Away Backward'"by Kim Ruehl, No Depression Magazine (September 18, 2013) 2001 saw the release of Couples in Trouble, a dark, brooding, and decidedly non-country album, and 13 Hillbilly Giants, a collection of covers of classic country numbers both obscure and well known. Both records were released by Bloodshot Records. Also in 2001, Fulks was an inaugural member of the judging panel for the Independent Music Awards, which supports independent artists.|$|E

5000|$|On television, Woodard guest-starred in two {{episodes of}} The Practice in 2003. For {{performance}} in show she has won her fourth Primetime Emmy Award. In 2005 {{she joined the}} cast of the ABC comedy-drama series, Desperate Housewives as Betty Applewhite, the new mystery housewife. The character is introduced in the last episodes of the series first season, and becomes {{the center of the}} mystery of the second season. The series creator Marc Cherry clarified: [...] "Theres nothing strategically black about her character. Her color is incidental." [...] Woodard stated that she had never seen the show before accepting the role, something that led the producers to send her fifteen episodes of the show, which she divided amongst various family members. After they compared storylines, Woodard recalled that she became [...] "instantly hooked" [...] on the series. As soon as Woodard accepted the role of Betty Applewhite, she reported experiencing heavy media attention. Woodards portrayal of Betty was praised and resulted in a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series in 2006. However, her mystery as a whole had mixed reviews. In a review of the second season premiere, Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly thought that the Applewhite mystery would help reduce the shows chances of falling into a sophomore slump. He praised Woodards acting as well as her characters storyline, opining, [...] "theres something so inherently warm and maternal in Woodards performance, such apple-pie wholesomeness, that it makes her touches of menace all the more chilling." [...] However, as the season progressed, there were many complaints about Bettys lack of interaction with the other housewives. She left the series in the second-season finale episode.Woodard was nominated for a Primetime Emmys for her roles in the television films The Water Is Wide, and Pictures of Hollis Woods (2007). She starred as lead in the Tyler Perrys drama film The Family That Preys in 2008. The film received mixed reviews from critics, but her performance received acclaim. Los Angeles Times critic Bob Baker said in review [...] "The film takes off when Woodards and Kathy Bates characters go on a Thelma & Louise-style road trip.", while The Washington Posts Neely Tucker wrote [...] "By far the best thing about the enterprise is Woodard. If shes not in this thing, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> kaput.". In next year she appeared in the independent drama American Violet, playing the mother of a 24-year-old African-American woman wrongfully swept up in a drug raid. She also starred in two short-lived television series: NBCs My Own Worst Enemy (2008), and CBSs Three Rivers (2009).|$|E

40|$|Previous {{literature}} {{has shown that}} the study and characterization of constrained efficient allocations in economies with limited enforcement is useful to understand the limited risk sharing observed in many contexts, in particular between sovereign countries. In this paper we show that these constrained efficient allocations arise as equilibria in an economy in which private agents behave competitively, taking as given a set of taxes. We then show that these taxes, which end up limiting risk sharing, arise as an equilibrium of a dynamic game between governments. Our decentralization is different from the existing ones proposed in the literature. We find it intuitively appealing and we <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> farther than the existing literature in endogenizing the primitive forces that lead to a lack of risk sharing in equilibrium.
