5|$|Although {{physically}} separate, another facility {{built in}} nearby Roquetoire {{was an integral}} part of the Wizernes complex. Umspannwerk C was built to house a Leitstrahl radio command guidance system which could be used to send course corrections to missiles launched from Wizernes <b>to</b> <b>fine-tune</b> their trajectory during the launch phase.|$|E
5|$|A {{powerful}} Senate Select Committee {{oversaw the}} NCDC and renowned British architect Sir William Holford {{was brought in}} <b>to</b> <b>fine-tune</b> Griffin's original plans. He changed the central basin's geometry {{so that it was}} no longer a segment of circle; he converted the southern straight edge into a polygonal shape with three edges and inserted a gulf on the northern shore. The result was closer to Scrivener's modified design some decades earlier.|$|E
5|$|The medial {{zone of the}} {{anterior}} and posterior lobes constitutes the spinocerebellum, also known as paleocerebellum. This sector of the cerebellum functions mainly <b>to</b> <b>fine-tune</b> body and limb movements. It receives proprioceptive input from the dorsal columns of the spinal cord (including the spinocerebellar tract) and from the cranial trigeminal nerve, {{as well as from}} visual and auditory systems. It sends fibers to deep cerebellar nuclei that, in turn, project to both the cerebral cortex and the brain stem, thus providing modulation of descending motor systems.|$|E
25|$|Various {{possible}} reactions <b>to</b> this <b>fine-tuning</b> {{are discussed}} among philosophers, scientists, theologians, and proponents and detractors of creationism. The fine-tuned Universe observation {{is closely related}} to, but is not exactly synonymous with, the anthropic principle, which is often appealed to in reactions <b>to</b> <b>fine-tuning.</b>|$|R

5|$|Commander T'Pol and Commander Tucker remain captives of Paxton, who {{continues}} to broadcast his demand on all channels and frequencies. Paxton's action has an unsettling effect on the interspecies conference since {{it is clear that}} not all humans support it. On Mars, Paxton allows T'Pol and Tucker see the baby, and T'Pol uses her scanner to learn that the child is unwell (and that Paxton has been using Rigelian gene therapy to treat himself). Seeking <b>to</b> <b>fine-tune</b> their attack, Paxton then threatens T'Pol to force Tucker to optimize the targeting system of the array.|$|E
5|$|Next is {{the short}} barrel; {{this part of}} the {{instrument}} may be extended <b>to</b> <b>fine-tune</b> the clarinet. As the pitch of the clarinet is fairly temperature-sensitive, some instruments have interchangeable barrels whose lengths vary slightly. Additional compensation for pitch variation and tuning can be made by pulling out the barrel and thus increasing the instrument's length, particularly common in group playing in which clarinets are tuned to other instruments (such as in an orchestra or concert band). Some performers use a plastic barrel with a thumbwheel that adjusts the barrel length. On basset horns and lower clarinets, the barrel is normally replaced by a curved metal neck.|$|E
5|$|As {{leader of}} the Moderate Party, Reinfeldt tended to be less {{forceful}} in his criticism of the Swedish welfare state than his predecessors. He instead proposed reforms to Sweden's welfare state, which included cutting taxes for the lowest income earners and reducing unemployment benefits, {{in order to encourage}} the jobless to return to work. He toned down calls within the party for dismantling large portions of the Swedish welfare state, stating that change must come gradually from the bottom up and not be dictated from the top down. His goal was said to be <b>to</b> <b>fine-tune</b> the welfare state, by focusing on getting people off welfare benefits and into employment. He worked to shift the conservatives toward the middle ground by convincing voters that he would fix rather than dismantle the public welfare system.|$|E

5|$|Modern writers {{all agree}} that Andrée's North Pole scheme was unrealistic. He relied on the winds blowing {{more or less in}} the {{direction}} he wanted to go, on being able <b>to</b> <b>fine-tune</b> his direction with the drag ropes, on the balloon being sealed tight enough to stay airborne for 30 days, and on no ice or snow sticking to the balloon to weigh it down. In the attempt of 1896, the wind immediately refuted his optimism by blowing steadily from the north, straight at the balloon hangar at Danes Island, until the expedition had to pack up, let the hydrogen out of the balloon, and go home. It is now known that northerly winds are to be expected at Danes Island; but in the late 19th century, information on Arctic airflow and precipitation existed only as contested academic hypotheses. Even Ekholm, an Arctic climate researcher, had no objection to Andrée's theory of where the wind was likely to take them. The observational data simply did not exist.|$|E

Kaplan was also helped by Champion Sparkplugs who let him use their dyno room <b>to</b> <b>fine-tune</b> and correct any design problems.|$|E
30|$|While {{a variety}} of {{information}} repositories are accessed by faculty in practice, {{it is important to}} highlight the finding regarding the centrality of curricular artifacts in the information retrieval process. That is, the regular pattern of retrieving old lecture notes and subjecting them <b>to</b> <b>fine-tuning</b> or ‘tweaking’ is a dominant mode of planning practice. This highlights two critical features of organizational learning: the importance of artifacts and the habituated nature of many organizational routines.|$|R

He also made The One-Man Band, in which Méliès continued <b>to</b> <b>fine-tune</b> his special effects by multiplying himself on camera to play seven instruments simultaneously. Another notable film was The Christmas Dream, which merged cinematic effects with traditional Christmas pantomime scenes.|$|E

Dentures in this price range are usually completely customized and personalized, use high-end materials to simulate the lifelike look of gums and teeth as closely as possible, {{last a long time}} and are warranted against chipping and cracking for 5–10 years or longer. Often the price includes several follow-up visits <b>to</b> <b>fine-tune</b> the fit.|$|E
25|$|The gearing {{supplied}} by the manufacturer on a new bicycle is selected to be useful {{to the majority of}} people. Some cyclists choose <b>to</b> <b>fine-tune</b> the gearing to better suit their strength, level of fitness, and expected use. When buying from specialist cycle shops, it may be less expensive to get the gears altered before delivery rather than at some later date. Modern crankset chainrings can be swapped out, as can cogsets.|$|E
25|$|The moving {{assembly}} line system, which started on October 7, 1913, allowed Ford {{to sell his}} cars at a price lower than his competitors. As he continued <b>to</b> <b>fine-tune</b> the system, Ford {{was able to keep}} reducing costs significantly. As volume increased, he was able to also lower the prices due to fixed costs being spread over a larger number of vehicles. Other factors affected the price such as material costs and design changes.|$|E

50|$|The {{flatness}} problem (also {{known as}} the oldness problem) is a cosmological fine-tuning problem within the Big Bang model of the universe. Such problems arise from the observation {{that some of the}} initial conditions of the universe appear <b>to</b> be <b>fine-tuned</b> <b>to</b> very 'special' values, and that small deviations from these values would have extreme effects on the appearance of the universe at the current time.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{scholars}} {{argue the}} 7.656 MeV Hoyle resonance, in particular, {{is unlikely to}} be the product of mere chance. Fred Hoyle argued in 1982 that the Hoyle resonance was evidence of a [...] "superintellect"; The scientific community rejects Hoyle's intelligent design argument as [...] "unparsimonious". Instead, some scientists believe that different universes, portions of a vast [...] "multiverse", have different fundamental constants: according <b>to</b> this controversial <b>fine-tuning</b> hypothesis, life can only evolve in the minority of universes where the fundamental constants happen <b>to</b> be <b>fine-tuned</b> <b>to</b> support the existence of life. Other scientists reject the hypothesis of the multiverse, arguing instead that the resonance energy match is coincidence.|$|R
25|$|After {{developing}} her design, Piccinini and {{her studio}} developed a 3D {{model of the}} balloon using computer-aided design software. This process was used to address the technical issues involved with developing a balloon which was safe to fly, as well as <b>to</b> <b>fine-tune</b> {{the appearance of the}} design. The Australian Capital Territory's government invited five specialist balloon manufacturers to submit proposals to construct The Skywhale, but the Bristol-based company Cameron Balloons was the only one to provide a bid.|$|E
25|$|The first NATO {{troops to}} enter Pristina on June 12, 1999 were Norwegian special forces from FSK Forsvarets Spesialkommando and {{soldiers}} from the British Special Air Service 22 S.A.S, although to NATO's diplomatic embarrassment Russian troops arrived first at the airport. The Norwegian soldiers from FSK Forsvarets Spesialkommando {{were the first to}} come in contact with the Russian troops at the airport. FSK's mission was to level the negotiating field between the belligerent parties, and <b>to</b> <b>fine-tune</b> the detailed, local deals needed to implement the peace deal between the Serbians and the Kosovo Albanians.|$|E
25|$|The Army {{picked up}} these options, {{developing}} two concepts. The first, Project Quick-Shot, was basically {{identical to the}} Feld and Tsipis version, although they did consider some sort of low-cost guidance system as well. A second concept launched optical trackers into space {{in the path of}} the incoming missiles, and used their data <b>to</b> <b>fine-tune</b> the launch of unguided rockets that would work at longer ranges. As this had no radar component, it would bypass provisions in the ABM treaty over the number and placement of radar sites.|$|E
