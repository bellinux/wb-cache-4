5|$|In January 1863, the {{regiment}} received orders <b>to</b> <b>fortify</b> their camp outside of New Bern. The improved camp was named Fort Peirson {{in honor of}} their commanding officer. During the spring of 1863, the unit took part in several expeditions to reconnoiter and dislodge enemy positions along the Pamlico and Neuse Rivers. These expeditions involved only minor skirmishing.|$|E
5|$|Abercrombie held a war {{council that}} evening. The options he {{presented}} {{to his staff}} were limited to asking if the next day's attack should be in three ranks or four; the council opted for three. Abercrombie's plan of attack omitted Clerk's recommendation <b>to</b> <b>fortify</b> the summit of Rattlesnake Hill; {{in addition to the}} frontal assault, 4 six-pound guns and a howitzer were to be floated down the La Chute River and mounted at the base of Rattlesnake Hill, with 20 bateaux of troops to support the effort.|$|E
5|$|According to Yuri Moshnik, {{a modern}} historian, the {{garrison}} at Viborg in 1710 stood at 6000 men; other modern historians B. Adamovich and A. I. Dubravin {{put the number}} at 4000. Since 1702, the commander there had been Zacharias Animoff, who was old and in poor health. For that reason, in February 1710, Colonel Magnus Stiernstråle officially replaced him; he had de facto headed the efforts <b>to</b> <b>fortify</b> the city.|$|E

The fortified rice kernel through hot extrusion most closely resembles natural rice after cooking.|$|R
50|$|In the World War I, the German retreat <b>to</b> <b>fortified</b> {{positions}} in the Hindenburg Line, which was officially named after Siegfried despite its common name, was named Operation Alberich.|$|R
5|$|Asser's Life omits {{any mention}} of {{internal}} strife or dissent in Alfred's own reign, though when he mentions that Alfred had to harshly punish those who were slow to obey Alfred's commands <b>to</b> <b>fortify</b> the realm, he {{makes it clear that}} Alfred did have to enforce obedience. Asser's life is a one-sided treatment of Alfred, though since Alfred was alive when it was composed, it is unlikely to contain gross errors of fact.|$|E
5|$|During Gage's {{administration}} political tensions rose {{throughout the}} American colonies. As a result, Gage began withdrawing {{troops from the}} frontier <b>to</b> <b>fortify</b> urban centres like New York City and Boston. As the number of soldiers stationed in cities grew, {{the need to provide}} adequate food and housing for these troops became urgent. Parliament passed the Quartering Act of 1765, permitting British troops to be quartered in vacant houses, barns, and outbuildings, but not private residences.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} avert having {{to conduct a}} war on two fronts, Domitian agreed to terms of peace with Decebalus, {{negotiating}} free access of Roman troops through the Dacian region while granting Decebalus an annual subsidy of 8 million sesterces. Contemporary authors severely criticized this treaty, which was considered shameful to the Romans and left the deaths of Sabinus and Fuscus unavenged. For the remainder of Domitian's reign Dacia remained a relatively peaceful client kingdom, but Decebalus used the Roman money <b>to</b> <b>fortify</b> his defenses.|$|E

5|$|In response, Corbulo {{sent the}} legions IV Scythica and XII Fulminata to Armenia, while he {{detailed}} {{the three other}} legions under his command (III Gallica, VI Ferrata and XV Apollinaris) <b>to</b> <b>fortify</b> {{the line of the}} river Euphrates, fearing that the Parthians might invade Syria. At the same time, he petitioned Nero to appoint a separate legate for Cappadocia, with the responsibility for conducting the war in Armenia.|$|E
5|$|Iron(II) sulfate {{is used as}} a {{precursor}} to other iron compounds. It is also used to reduce chromate in cement. It is used <b>to</b> <b>fortify</b> foods and treat iron deficiency anemia. Iron(III) sulfate is used in settling minute sewage particles in tank water. Iron(II) chloride {{is used as a}} reducing flocculating agent, in the formation of iron complexes and magnetic iron oxides, and as a reducing agent in organic synthesis.|$|E
5|$|Kosovo Albanian {{refugees}} took {{to using}} bunkers as temporary shelters until aid agencies could move them into tent camps, while NATO troops stationed in Albania relocated dozens of bunkers <b>to</b> <b>fortify</b> their base at Kukës. The Kosovo Liberation Army also used them as defensive positions during the Kosovo War, {{though this was}} not without its risks; {{on at least one}} occasion bunkers along Albania's border with Kosovo were mistakenly bombed by NATO aircraft.|$|E
50|$|After {{their victory}} the Mamluks pillaged Larnaca {{again and then}} the capital of Cyprus, Nicosia. The royal family retreated <b>to</b> <b>fortified</b> Kyrenia and were rescued. The invaders took {{a great deal of}} loot and captives before they left the island.|$|R

50|$|To prevent Marquess of Wellington's army invading France in 1813, Marshal Soult built {{a line of}} fortifications and entrenchments {{along the}} river Nivelle from the sea inland <b>to</b> <b>fortified</b> rocks on Mount Mondarrain. The lines were {{breached}} during the Battle of Nivelle 10 November 1813.|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, concerns grew in the British government about the threat of German invasion along the east coast of England. The bays just to the north of Dunstanburgh Castle were vulnerable targets for an enemy amphibious landing, and efforts were made <b>to</b> <b>fortify</b> the castle and the surrounding area in 1940, as part of a wider line of defences erected by Sir Edmund Ironside.|$|E
5|$|The Indian agent Lorimier {{traveled}} west to Oswegatchie, where {{a company}} of the 8th Regiment of Foot {{under the command of}} George Forster had occupied Fort de La Présentation. Lorimier proposed recruiting a force of Indians to launch an attack on Continental forces at Montreal from the west. When Forster agreed, Lorimier went to Saint Regis, where he recruited 100Mohawk men from Akwesasne. Word of these activities led the American rebels <b>to</b> <b>fortify</b> The Cedars.|$|E
5|$|The siege {{was broken}} in March 1776 when Continental Army Colonel Henry Knox brought heavy {{artillery}} from Fort Ticonderoga to Boston during the winter, and General Washington used them <b>to</b> <b>fortify</b> Dorchester Heights, overlooking Boston and its harbour. Howe at first planned {{an assault on}} this position, but a snowstorm interfered, and he eventually decided to withdraw from Boston. On 17 March, British troops and Loyalists evacuated the city, and sailed for Halifax, Nova Scotia.|$|E
50|$|The Slavic {{invasions of}} the 7th century led to {{widespread}} destruction, {{with much of}} the population fleeing <b>to</b> <b>fortified</b> cities, the Aegean islands and Italy, while some Slavic tribes settled the interior.

5|$|Adolf Hitler {{was furious}} that the British {{had been able}} to sail a {{flotilla}} of ships up the Loire unhindered. His immediate reaction was to dismiss Generaloberst Carl Hilpert, chief-of-staff to the Commander in Chief West. The raid refocused German attention on the Atlantic Wall, and special attention was given to ports to prevent any repeat of the raid. By June 1942, the Germans began using concrete <b>to</b> <b>fortify</b> gun emplacements and bunkers in quantities previously only used in U-boat pens. Hitler laid out new plans in a meeting with Armaments Minister Albert Speer in August 1942, calling for the construction of 15,000 bunkers by May 1943 to defend the Atlantic coast from Norway to Spain.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the time}} of the initial sales {{agreement}} in November 1988 and the finalization of the acquisition of Pillsbury in January 1989, Grand Metropolitan set about putting its own corporate stamp on Burger King; the stated goal of Grand Met CEO Allen Sheppard was to upgrade the overall performance of the chain and improve its standing as the second largest fast-food burger chain globally. To that end, he had the company initiate a three-prong strategy of evaluation of operations, personnel moves, and structural changes and improvements <b>to</b> <b>fortify</b> the company.|$|E
5|$|Cassel was {{annexed to}} France the {{following}} year {{under the terms of}} the Treaty of Nijmegen, which ended the war. The annexation led to the town's defences being dismantled; it was considered indefensible, as it was within easy firing range of the nearby Mont des Récollets, and it would have cost far too much <b>to</b> <b>fortify</b> both hills. In addition, the revised frontier following the treaty was now a significant distance from Cassel and without the proximity of the border, the town was no longer seen as having much strategic significance.|$|E
50|$|The Inca general {{commanded}} <b>to</b> <b>fortified</b> {{the mountain}} pass at Vilcaconga where the Spaniards {{would have to}} pass, and managed to ambush them, with great losses for the invaders.

5|$|During 1888, Jingyuen was repainted {{along with}} the rest of the Chinese Navy, {{changing}} from the all grey scheme she had sailed from England with, to a combination of a black hull, white above the waterline and buff coloured funnels, typical of the Victorian era. In May 1889, Jingyuen and the Beiyang Fleet were moved <b>to</b> <b>fortify</b> Weihaiwei (now Weihai). During the summer of that year, she was part of the flotilla led by Admiral Ding Ruchang, which travelled to Chefoo (now Yantai), Chemlupo (now Incheon, South Korea), and the Imperial Russian Navy base of Vladivostok. On the return leg of the journey, they stopped at Fusan (now Busan, South Korea).|$|E
5|$|Feversham {{aimed to}} contain the rebels in the South West until {{the rest of his}} forces, {{including}} three battalions of British mercenaries sent by William III of Orange from Holland arrived. In the light of propaganda suggesting the rebels had an army of 40,000 and that 500 royalist troops had been lost at Norton St Philip, Feversham was ordered to engage Monmouth's forces. On 30 June the final parts of Feversham's army, including his artillery, arrived and eventually Monmouth was pushed back via Shepton Mallet to the Somerset Levels, where Alfred the Great had found refuge in his conflicts with the Vikings. Becoming hemmed in at Bridgwater on 3 July, he ordered his troops <b>to</b> <b>fortify</b> the town.|$|E
5|$|Henry VIII {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of an artillery blockhouse at East Tilbury in 1539–40 as part of a major scheme <b>to</b> <b>fortify</b> the coastline of England and Wales. It followed his break from the Pope and the Catholic Church, which led to fears that the Catholic powers of Europe would seek to invade so as to reimpose Papal authority. Five blockhouses were built along the Thames between Gravesend and Higham – two on the north bank at Tilbury and East Tilbury and three on the south bank at Gravesend, Milton (near the present New Tavern Fort) and Higham.|$|E
5000|$|The castle {{was built}} in 1233 on the {{foundations}} of a Romanic cathedral and the walls were added later (between 1269 and 1283) by Charles I of Anjou.

5000|$|Both army groups {{headquarters}} did {{not wish}} to engage in dense forests and swamps with few roads. A Red Army offensive would be fruitless, since the only road leading <b>to</b> <b>fortified</b> Vitebsk (near the south bank of the Western Dvina) was controlled by the Germans. The Red Army did not attempt an offensive after the 249th Infantry Division's retreat in February 1942.|$|R
