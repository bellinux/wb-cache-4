5|$|After 1907, Cooke's {{dominance}} of the national basketball scene was greatly reduced. He led the team to two more conference titles (1916–17, 1918–19), and one consensus retroactive national championship for the 1918–19 season, but the team was never the consistent winner {{that it was in}} the first decade under Cooke. He retired after the 1923–1924 season. His successor, Harold Taylor, was Cooke's assistant coach in his final season and had previously a successful high school coach; however, he had little success with the Gophers and was fired after never finishing higher than sixth in <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> three forgettable seasons.|$|E
5|$|Another of Margate's rivals is Dover Athletic. Despite meeting {{rarely in}} {{competitive}} games over recent years, both teams were in <b>the</b> <b>Conference</b> <b>in</b> the 2001–02 season.

5|$|Despite {{the failure}} to deliver a winning season, Vanderlinden did oversee {{substantive}} improvement in the program.

In 1999, Maryland allowed a conference low of 11 sacks compared with 56 in 1997. In that same period, Maryland also improved from last to first in <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> rushing, {{due in large part to}} Heisman Trophy candidate and school career rushing leader LaMont Jordan. During Vanderlinden's tenure, Maryland also recruited several key players who were instrumental in the team's later success.|$|E

5|$|Gough Whitlam {{saw that}} the party had little chance of being elected unless it could expand its appeal from the {{traditional}} working-class base to include the suburban middle class.

Whitlam resigned the leadership, demanding {{a vote of confidence}} from caucus. He defeated Cairns for the leadership in an unexpectedly close 38–32 vote. Despite the vote, the executive refused to seat Harradine.|$|E
5|$|Jonas Mouton was the Big Ten's {{statistical}} {{champion in}} tackles, while Jordan Kovacs finished second. In conference games alone, Roy Roundtree led <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> receiving yards per game, {{in part on}} the strength of a school single-game record 246-yard outing against Illinois. Reserve quarterback Tate Forcier also set a school single-game completion percentage record with a 12-for-12 performance against Bowling Green.

5|$|The Hokie {{defense was}} led by {{defensive}} end Corey Moore, who was named the Big East {{defensive player of the}} year for 1998.
