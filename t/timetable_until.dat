5000|$|The {{station was}} opened as [...] "Theydon" [...] by the Great Eastern Railway (GER) on 24 April 1865 but in December that {{year it was}} renamed to its present name. It opened as an {{intermediate}} station on their Loughton-Ongar extension; the GER {{became part of the}} London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923. 'Milk trains' to Liverpool Street were a regular feature in the <b>timetable</b> <b>until</b> the underpass from Leyton to Stratford was built.|$|E
50|$|The station opened as G.E. Works on September 9, 1965 {{to serve}} {{workers of the}} plant, which had opened early in the century and been {{substantially}} expanded during World War II. The name was changed to River Works in the late 1970s. It did not appear on maps until the MBTA bought the northside commuter lines in 1976, and was listed only as a footnote on public <b>timetables</b> <b>until</b> January 1989.|$|R

50|$|The final Bradshaw’s Guide to Victoria was {{published}} in August 1942. Interestingly however, {{there was a large}} print run of the last edition, and it was available from many newsagents for some years after it {{was published}}. In December 1941, the Victorian Railways had published their last public timetable, primarily because of staff shortages caused by World War II but also continuing into the post-war period. There was not another VR <b>timetable</b> <b>until</b> 1954. Therefore, ironically, the last edition of Bradshaw's, albeit out of date, {{was the only thing that}} the public had to refer to. Within nine months Victoria went from having two regular Railway public timetables to none.|$|E
50|$|After the opening, a train ran on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, leaving Awre at 11:10 and {{arriving}} at Howbeach at 11:35. Blakeney {{did not appear}} in the <b>timetable</b> <b>until</b> January 1870. The service terminated at Howbeach because the branch to New Fancy, although licensed by the Crown on 6 April 1868 to the Park End Coal Company, was not ready until early in 1869. The section northward from New Fancy Junction to Foxes Bridge was never completed. At the lower end, the final approach to Brimspill, east of the South Wales Railway was constructed but also never completed. (A short length of track appears to have been laid on it but not connected to the operational line.).|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{rebranding}} to Hillsbus, the new Hillsbus website {{was only}} launched in January 2006, {{about a year}} after the rebranding. The delay could be related to the debt of Westbus and was only resolved after the sale of Westbus and Hillsbus to CDC. After the launch of the new website, it still did not show any timetables of the former Glenorie-operated <b>timetables</b> <b>until</b> May/June 2006, and during this period, customers were asked to check the Glenorie website instead.|$|R

50|$|The Sunshine Special {{was inaugurated}} by the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway, (later the Missouri Pacific Railroad), on December 5, 1915, {{to provide a}} premium level of {{passenger}} train service between St. Louis, Little Rock, and destinations in Texas. Until being shifted into a secondary role by the Texas Eagle diesel powered streamliner in August 1948, the Sunshine Special served as the flagship of the Missouri Pacific Railroad's passenger train service.

50|$|The Lodestars did {{not last}} long on the Northland service for on 2 April 1951 Douglas DC-3s were {{introduced}} on the Auckland - Kaikohe - Kaitaia route. The feeder service from Whangarei was discontinued at the same time. The new DC-3 service continued to operate on this <b>timetable</b> <b>until</b> 1964, when it again arrived from Auckland via Whangarei.In 1967 the air service was in jeopardy as it had handled the least number of passengers of any of NAC’s destinations. In 1969 it was reported NAC carried only 5000 passengers through Kaikohe, an average of seven in and seven out daily. In 1970 Kaikohe lost its air service with NAC due to this low patronage and the fact the DC3's that were in use being replaced by larger Fokker Friendships which could not handle the uneven grass runways.|$|E
50|$|The station {{opened in}} December 1864 by the Border Union Railway. The station was {{situated}} {{on the west side}} of an unnamed minor road. Despite the station opening in December 1864, it actually didn't appear in the Bradshaw <b>timetable</b> <b>until</b> October 1865. A loop to the west of the station served a cattle dock and to the east a siding passed a blicks plinth for a crane. The station was always quiet except the Second World War when Canadian foresters were working in the forest dispatching large amounts of timber from the goods yard. The station was unstaffed from 2 February 1953, although 'halt' didn't appear on the end of its name. However, the goods yard was downgraded to a public delivery siding. After closure to passengers on 15 June 1964, the station remained open to goods traffic until 18 September 1967.|$|E
50|$|The station {{opened on}} 1 November 1849 as New Belses by the North British Railway. The station was {{situated}} {{on the south side}} of the B6400. The name was changed to Belses in July 1868, although the name was still shown as New Belses in the <b>timetable</b> <b>until</b> 1868. The goods yard was on the up side and was accessed from two points of the station. The yard consisted of a cattle dock with a loop siding passing to the east. Beyond the siding was a building that may have been a coal depot. On 28 December 1964 goods services were withdrawn from the station and the sidings in the goods yard were quickly lifted. On March 1967 the station was downgraded to an unstaffed halt, although the suffix 'halt' never appeared in the timetable. The station was closed to passengers on 6 January 1969.|$|E
5000|$|The line to {{the docks}} was opened on 9 October 1840 but the station was not {{mentioned}} in Bradshaw's railway <b>timetables</b> <b>until</b> December 1844. It was opened as [...] "Cardiff Bute Dock" [...] but the name was changed to [...] "Cardiff Docks" [...] in 1845 by the Taff Vale Railway (engineer: Isambard Kingdom Brunel). The station building was the head office of the TVR until 1862. After this it also housed the consulates of the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal and Brazil, with separate flag poles provided for each nation.|$|R
2500|$|The {{station was}} opened in February 1853 as Fotherby Gate House, some {{five years after}} the East Lincolnshire Railway between [...] and [...] had opened on 1 March 1848. The origins of the station's name lay in the {{gatehouse}} constructed in 1847 by contractor John Waring and Sons of Rotherham to control the crossing over Peppin Lane near Fotherby, to the south of which the station lay. It was served by a twice-weekly passenger service restricted to market days. This reduced its patronage {{to such an extent that}} it was closed on 28 June 1872, but remained in public <b>timetables</b> <b>until</b> October 1872.|$|R
50|$|The station opened around June 1869, {{however in}} either 1882 or 1883, it was renamed Bushwick Junction for the {{connection}} to the Bushwick Branch. The station was rebuilt in April 1895 and closed again in 1915 {{as part of a}} grade elimination project. Though the third station was opened the same year with platforms and pedestrian bridges, the former station house still remained intact well into 1923. For the next four years, both the original name and new name would be on the LIRR <b>timetables</b> <b>until</b> it went back to strictly being named Fresh Pond in 1919.|$|R
5000|$|Holiday {{traffic to}} Lowestoft prospered, {{particularly}} after 13 July 1898 when the Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Committee {{opened a new}} line from [...] and Yarmouth South Town via , [...] and [...] to Lowestoft, where a second station serving the town, named , was opened. The opening of a second station in the town resulted in the main station being renamed Lowestoft Central in 1903. The Great Eastern sought to foster the holiday traffic by providing a bus service to Southwold from 18 July 1904 to January 1913 and also one to Oulton Broad. The increased naval activity {{brought on by the}} First World War saw the number of passengers using Lowestoft Central via the Norfolk & Suffolk double from a pre-war average of 25,000 per year to a near-record of 54,506 in 1918. The record was reached in 1919 when 63,859 used the station. In Summer 1924, a long-distance restaurant car express ran from Liverpool, Manchester and Sheffield to Lowestoft and Yarmouth, while an all-year round service began operating to and from York with portions for Lowestoft and Yarmouth dividing at Reedham. The journey to York took just over six hours, while Liverpool was reached in seven hours. A restaurant car was added to the York express by the early 1930s and the service remained in the <b>timetable</b> <b>until</b> the mid 1960s, although in its later years a buffet car was used instead. The Holiday Camps Express ran via Lowestoft to serve the holiday camps along the coast from 1934 to 1939 and then after the war until 1958. Another express, The Easterling, was introduced in June 1950 to run non-stop between Liverpool Street and Beccles where a portion would be detached for Lowestoft.|$|E
30|$|The {{simulation}} {{procedure in}} timetable-based software (typically used in Europe) {{is based on}} the initial timetable of trains and the objective is to improve the timetable as much as possible. The UIC’s capacity approach is often one of the main theories behind the timetable-based simulation approach. The simulation process in this methodology begins with creating a timetable for each train. In the case of schedule conflict between the trains, the user must adjust the <b>timetable</b> <b>until</b> a feasible schedule is achieved. However, the user actions are more structured compared to the improvised method, and is implemented as part of the simulation process [21]. There are several common software tools in this category, such as MultiRail (U.S.), RAILSIM (U.S.), OpenTrack (Switzerland), SIMONE (The Netherlands), RailSys (Germany), DEMIURGE (France), RAILCAP (Belgium), and CMS (UK) [9, 30]. A comprehensive capability review of various simulation tools is outside the scope of this paper, but three simulation packages (RTC, RailSys, and OpenTrack) are briefly introduced to demonstrate some key differences between non-timetable-based and timetable-based software.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} and study a handshake algorithm based on random delays. This algorithm {{can also be}} considered as a probabilistic distributed algorithm to find a (maximal) matching. Each process of the network generates a random time, chosen uniformly in the real interval [0, 1] for each of its neighboring processes. The generated number {{is supposed to be a}} possible time for a handshake, if both processes are available at that time. Initially the number of potentially possible times proposed by the processes is twice the number of links between them. Whenever the clock reaches the smallest generated item, there will be a handshake between the process that proposes this time and the requested process and they cancel all other data from their timetable, informing their other neighboring processes, which in turn remove the times proposed by the two processes. The process continues in the remaining processes equipped with the updated <b>timetable</b> <b>until</b> the unit time 1 has expired. This algorithm is substantially more efficient than previous ones known to us, in that the expected number of handshakes per round is larger...|$|E
