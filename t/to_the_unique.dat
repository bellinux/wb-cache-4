5|$|At Hanford, top {{priority}} was initially {{given to the}} installations in the 300 area. This contained buildings for testing materials, preparing uranium, and assembling and calibrating instrumentation. One of the buildings housed the canning equipment for the uranium slugs, while another contained a small test reactor. Notwithstanding the high priority allocated to it, work on the 300 area fell behind schedule due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>unique</b> and complex nature of the 300 area facilities, and wartime shortages of labor and materials.|$|E
5|$|Characteristically, Sebrights {{are only}} {{one of a few}} chicken breeds in which the roosters are hen feathered, meaning they have none of the long, sickleshaped {{feathers}} common in most roosters that appear in the tail, neck and saddle. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>unique</b> characteristic hen feathering, molecular biologists have found the Sebright bantam a useful model organism in the study of sex hormones. This is because they carry a mutation that causes the tissues of their skin to convert an unusually large amount of male sex hormones (androgens) into female sex hormones (estrogens).|$|E

5|$|In {{the book}} Peron and the Enigmas of Argentina, biographer Robert D.

5|$|Upon their release, Black and White {{received}} positive reviews; critics {{praised the}} advancements in gameplay, {{as well as}} several of the new Pokémon introduced; much acclaim went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>unique,</b> complex plot. Reviewers, however, were divided on some of the character designs, and some critics felt that the games did not innovate as much as expected. Nevertheless, the games were commercial successes; prior to the games' Japanese release, Black and White sold one million consumer pre-orders and sold five million copies as of January 2011, {{making it one of the}} best selling DS games to date. As of March 2015, the games' combined sales have reached 15.60 million, putting the titles amongst the best selling games for the Nintendo DS, but still being outsold by their predecessors, Diamond and Pearl.|$|E
5|$|The United States has {{the most}} tornadoes of any country, nearly four times more than {{estimated}} in all of Europe, excluding waterspouts. This is mostly due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>unique</b> geography of the continent. North America is a large continent that extends from the tropics north into arctic areas, and has no major east-west mountain range to block air flow between these two areas. In the middle latitudes, where most tornadoes of the world occur, the Rocky Mountains block moisture and buckle the atmospheric flow, forcing drier air at mid-levels of the troposphere due to downsloped winds, and causing {{the formation of a}} low pressure area downwind to the east of the mountains. Increased westerly flow off the Rockies force the formation of a dry line when the flow aloft is strong, while the Gulf of Mexico fuels abundant low-level moisture in the southerly flow to its east. This unique topography allows for frequent collisions of warm and cold air, the conditions that breed strong, long-lived storms throughout the year. A large portion of these tornadoes form in an area of the central United States known as Tornado Alley. This area extends into Canada, particularly Ontario and the Prairie Provinces, although southeast Quebec, the interior of British Columbia, and western New Brunswick are also tornado-prone. Tornadoes also occur across northeastern Mexico.|$|E
