5|$|Mars is a {{terrestrial}} planet {{that consists of}} minerals containing silicon and oxygen, metals, and other elements that typically make up rock. <b>The</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mars</b> is primarily composed of tholeiitic basalt, although parts are more silica-rich than typical basalt and may be similar to andesitic rocks on Earth or silica glass. Regions of low albedo suggest concentrations of plagioclase feldspar, with northern low albedo regions displaying higher than normal concentrations of sheet silicates and high-silicon glass. Parts of the southern highlands include detectable amounts of high-calcium pyroxenes. Localized concentrations of hematite and olivine have been found. Much of the surface is deeply covered by finely grained iron(III) oxide dust.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} {{distributed}} architecture for accelerated pre-processing of remote sensing data for immediate terrain visualization. Interactive 3 D visualization approaches for large terrain datasets employ {{level of detail}} techniques that require a multi-resolution data representation. The high computational cost of constructing these representations is often not viewed as a major drawback, as it is considered an off-line pre-processing step. This prevents the application of existing methods {{in the case of}} changing data, which is becoming increasingly important for a multitude of applications where datasets are being generated, transmitted and must be visualized immediately, such as in disaster management. Our system uses graphics processing units (GPUs) to accelerate the process of generating a multi-resolution representation, achieving sufficient performance to enable on-line visu-alization on a front-end workstation communicating with a back-end cluster of machines equipped with GPUs. As a reference data structure, we use a quad tree decomposition of the so-called HEALPix sphere parameterization, which is well-suited for spherical ter-rain rendering. Our system correctly handles overlapping and unregistered mixed-resolution datasets. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by applying it to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mar...</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1894, {{with the}} help of William Pickering, Percival Lowell, a wealthy Bostonian, founded the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. In 1906, {{convinced}} he could resolve the conundrum of Uranus's orbit, he began an extensive project to search for a trans-Neptunian planet, which he named PlanetX, a name previously used by Gabriel Dallet. The X in the name represents an unknown and is pronounced as the letter, as opposed to the Roman numeral for 10 (at the time, PlanetX would have been the ninth planet). Lowell's hope in tracking down PlanetX was to establish his scientific credibility, which had eluded him due to his widely derided belief that channel-like features visible on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mars</b> were canals constructed by an intelligent civilization.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{communications}} between the Earth and spacecraft are not instantaneous. There {{is a brief}} delay from the source to the receiver, which becomes more noticeable as distances increase. This delay was significant for {{communications between}} ground control and Apollo 8 when it became the first manned spacecraft to orbit the Moon: for every question, the ground control station had to wait at least threeseconds for the answer to arrive. The communications delay between Earth and Mars can vary between five and twenty minutes depending upon the relative positions of the two planets. As a consequence of this, if a robot on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mars</b> were to encounter a problem, its human controllers would {{not be aware of}} it until at least five minutes later, and possibly up to twenty minutes later; it would then take a further five to twenty minutes for instructions to travel from Earth to Mars.|$|E
5|$|At the University of Leipzig in 1862–64, German {{astronomer}} Johann K. F. Zöllner {{developed a}} custom photometer {{to measure the}} reflectivity of the Moon, planets and bright stars. For Mars, he derived an albedo of 0.27. Between 1877 and 1893, German astronomers Gustav Müller and Paul Kempf observed Mars using Zöllner's photometer. They found a small phase coefficient—the variation in reflectivity with angle—indicating that <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mars</b> is smooth and without large irregularities. In 1867, French astronomer Pierre Janssen and British astronomer William Huggins used spectroscopes to examine the atmosphere of Mars. Both compared the optical spectrum of Mars {{to that of the}} Moon. As the spectrum of the latter did not display absorption lines of water, they believed they had detected the presence of water vapor in the atmosphere of Mars. This result was confirmed by German astronomer Herman C. Vogel in 1872 and English astronomer Edward W. Maunder in 1875, but would later come into question.|$|E
40|$|Periglacial landforms on Earth reflect cold-climate {{conditions}} and are intimately related to processes {{due to the}} presence of ground ice and perennially frozen ground, permafrost. The overall objective of this thesis is to investigate the potential of Svalbard as an analogue to Mars cold-climate landforms, and explore past and present processes and surface conditions on Mars by inference from morphological counterparts in Svalbard. Svalbard has unique advantages that make it a very useful study area. Svalbard is easily accessible and offers a periglacial landscape where many different landforms can be encountered in close spatial proximity. These landforms include thermal contraction cracks, slope stripes, rock glaciers, gullies, debris flows, solifluction lobes, protalus ramparts, and pingos, all of which are close morphological analogues to landforms on Mars. An approach of integrated landscape analysis, inferred from landform assemblages in Svalbard, is aimed to explore modeling landscape evolution on Mars. Key datasets include visual remote sensing data of similar resolution (20 – 25 cm/pxl) from Svalbard (High Resolution Stereo Camera–Airborne Extended [HRSC-AX]) and Mars (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment [HiRISE]). Additional data are digital elevation models over both Svalbard and Mars and remote sensing data from Mars, such as Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) and Context Camera (CTX) images. Field work was done in combination with remote sensing to acquire ground-truth data. In Svalbard, fluvial and debris-flow processes are evident in the formation of gullies, but the morphological characteristics clearly show that the transport and sedimentation of eroded material are predominated by debris flows. Most investigated gullies on Mars lack clear evidence for debris-flow processes. The Martian gully fan morphology is more consistent with the deposition of small overlapping fans by multiple fluvial flow events. Clear evidence for debris flows on Mars was only found in two new locations, in addition to a few previously published examples. Detailed studies on debris-flow deposits in a young mid-latitude crater on Mars suggest the action of liquid water after Mars’ last ice age (0. 4 – 2. 1 Ma ago). It may represent the most recent morphological indication of water induced mass wasting on Mars. An investigation of small-scale lobes on Mars northern high-latitudes and their morphological counterparts in Svalbard (solifluction lobes) further suggests widespread thawing and the presence of transient liquid water in the recent past on Mars. Finally, different qualitative scenarios of landscape evolution on Mars to better understand the action of periglacial processes on Mars in the recent past are proposed. The results show that field work is a suitable approach in analogue studies and facilitates acquisition of first-hand experience with permafrost environments. Based on the morphological ambiguity of certain landforms, it is concluded that Martian cold-climate landforms should not be investigated in isolation, but as part of a landscape system in a geological and spatial context. Analogous landforms in Svalbard occur in strikingly similar proximity as on Mars, which makes them useful to infer the spatial and chronological evolution <b>of</b> Martian cold-climate <b>surface</b> processes. <b>The</b> analysis <b>of</b> the morphological inventory of analogous landforms and landform systems in Svalbard and on Mars give substantial information to constrain the processes operating on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mar...</b>|$|R

5|$|Radar {{results from}} SHARAD {{suggested}} that features termed lobate debris aprons (LDAs) contain {{large amounts of}} water ice. Of interest {{from the days of}} the Viking Orbiters, these LDA are aprons of material surrounding cliffs. They have a convex topography and a gentle slope; this suggests flow away from the steep source cliff. In addition, lobate debris aprons can show surface lineations just as rock glaciers on the Earth. SHARAD has provided strong evidence that the LDAs in Hellas Planitia are glaciers that are covered with a thin layer of debris (i.e. rocks and dust); a strong reflection from the top and base of LDAs was observed, suggesting that pure water ice makes up the bulk of the formation (between the two reflections). Based on the experiments of the Phoenix lander and the studies of the Mars Odyssey from orbit, water ice is known to exist just under <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mars</b> in the far north and south (high latitudes).|$|E

Further in the Delta Labs, the marine encounters the injured Swann. Swann informs the marine that Kelly has been working with Hell for possibly the whole time, and has been transformed by the demons.

Although advancements have beenmade in this research area, robots are not yet able to performhousehold chores robustly in unstructured and open-ended environments givenunexpected events and uncertainty in perception and execution. In this thesis, we are analyzing which perceptual andmotor capabilities are necessaryfor the robot to perform common tasks in a household scenario. In that context, an essential capability is tounderstand the scene that the robot has to interact with. This involvesseparating objects from the background but also from each other. Once this is achieved, many other tasks becomemuch easier. Configuration of objectscan be determined; they can be identified or categorized; their pose can be estimated; free and occupied space in the environment can be outlined. This kind of scene model can then inform grasp planning algorithms to finally pick up objects. However, scene understanding is not a trivial problem and evenstate-of-the-art methods may fail. Given an incomplete, noisy andpotentially erroneously segmented scene model, the questions remain howsuitable grasps can be planned {{and how they can}} be executed robustly. In this thesis, we propose to equip the robot with a set of predictionmechanisms that allow it to hypothesize about parts of the sceneit has not yet observed. Additionally, the robot can alsoquantify how uncertain it is about this prediction allowing it toplan actions for exploring the scene at specifically uncertainplaces. We consider multiple modalities includingmonocular and stereo vision, haptic sensing and information obtainedthrough a human-robot dialog system. We also study several scene representations of different complexity and their applicability to a grasping scenario. Given an improved scene model from this multi-modalexploration, grasps can be inferred for each objecthypothesis. Dependent on whether the objects are known, familiar orunknown, different methodologies for grasp inference apply. In thisthesis, we propose novel methods for each of these cases. Furthermore,we demonstrate the execution of these grasp both in a closed andopen-loop manner showing the effectiveness of the proposed methods inreal-world scenarios. QC 20111125 GRAS...|$|R
