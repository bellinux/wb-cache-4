5000|$|National Audubon Society v. Superior Court (Supreme Court of California, 1983, [...] ) {{was a key}} case in California {{highlighting}} {{the conflict between the}} public <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine</b> and appropriative water rights. The Public <b>Trust</b> <b>Doctrine</b> is based on the principle that certain resources (such as navigable waters) are too valuable to be privately owned and must remain available for public use. In National Audubon Society v. Superior Court, the court held that the public <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine</b> restricts the amount of water that can be withdrawn from navigable waterways. The basis for the Public <b>Trust</b> <b>Doctrine</b> goes back to Roman law. Under Roman law, the air, the rivers, the sea and the seashore were incapable of private ownership; they were dedicated {{to the use of the}} public. In essence, the public <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine</b> establishes the role of the state as having trustee environmental duties owed to the public that are subsequently enforceable by the public. There is judicial recognition of this, dictating that certain rights of the public are key to individual common law rights (such as state recognition of the public right or trust for waterways and coastal zones). Judicial recognition of the public <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine</b> has been established for tidelands and non-navigable waterways, submerged land (such as lake beds) and the waters above them, and preservation of a public interest (such as recreation, swimming, access, and sport fishing).|$|E

40|$|Oceanfront {{landowners and}} states share a {{property}} boundary that runs between the {{wet and dry}} parts of the shore. This legal coastline is different from an ordinary land boundary. First, on sandy beaches, the line is constantly in flux, and it cannot be marked except momentarily. Without {{the help of a}} surveyor and a court, neither the landowner nor a citizen walking down the beach has the ability to know exactly where the line lies. This uncertainty means that, as a practical matter, ownership of some part of the beach is effectively shared. Second, the common law establishes that the owner of each oceanfront lot holds easement-like interests in adjacent state-owned land; and, the state holds similar interests in the oceanfront lot. For these two reasons, the legal relationship between the oceanfront owner and the state is more interdependent than it may seem at first. It is much more than the usual neighbor relationship. Disputes over oceanfront property are often framed as cases of wrongful taking under the Fifth Amendment’s Just Compensation Clause. The Supreme Court has historically applied its standard takings test for determining whether or not a state is liable for the impact of its rules on a landowner’s rights. This Article is the first to examine the question of whether use of this standard test is optimal, or even logical, in cases between states and the owners of oceanfront land. Given the fact that climate change impacts such as sea-level rise are likely to increase rates of conflict along the legal coastline, the potential benefits of a test that takes into account the special relationship between these parties are significant. Support for an alternative test can be found in two sets of common law property rules, the upland rights and public <b>trust</b> <b>doctrines,</b> as well as in a mechanism that nineteenth-century courts used to resolve similar disputes...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} the {{doctrines of}} the sham and the alter-ego and their {{application to the}} law of trusts in South Africa. Following an initial examination of the historical development of the law of trusts in English law and the principles of equity law, the study focuses on the current legal status of the trust inter vivos in South Africa and the similarities to its English forerunner. The work traces the sham doctrine back to its origins in English law, where the term “sham” was first used in the context of fraud and dishonesty in cases involving matters arising from hire-purchase agreements, and explains how it gradually began to find its place in the law of trusts. During the exploration, the work highlights the cornerstone of the sham doctrine’s development, the Snook test, which in effect became the internationally accepted guideline for any sham trust enquiry. In terms of the alter-ego doctrine, the work highlights the birth of the principle in Australian law and the doctrine’s immediate reception into other common law jurisdictions and its resultant development. The growth, maturity and popularity of the doctrines are key to the thesis and, {{in the course of the}} investigation, the study provides a legal-comparative analysis of the treatment of the doctrines in the context of trusts against that in other common law countries. The study then shifts its focus to South Africa’s interpretation and application of these <b>doctrines</b> in <b>trust</b> law, and reveals the erroneous judicial development in which the courts have in some instances mistakenly replaced the sham doctrine with the company law doctrine of piercing the corporate veil or, in other instances, have erroneously conflated the two <b>trust</b> <b>doctrines.</b> The results highlight a breach of a fundamental rule observed overseas – the “no half way house” rule, which specifically cautions against South Africa’s chosen direction when allowing the lifting of a trust’s veil. The study closes with suggestions as to how the country could reconcile the problems underlined in the thesis by means of law reform, as well as offering practical advice for settlors, trustees and beneficiaries, the core of which is given in the handbook that accompanies this thesis. ...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“FWS”) has come to define its {{conservation}} mission {{in the context of}} species protection. The concept of “trust species” is now a common focal point for the myriad responsibilities of the FWS. This has become problematic for one of the major programs of the agency: management of the world’s largest biodiversity conservation network, the national wildlife refuge system (“NWRS”). A major legislative overhaul of the NWRS charter and the imperatives of climate change adaptation have weakened the concept as a reliable touchstone for NWRS management and expansion. The FWS should build on its culture and history to respond to new challenges that the conservation network cannot meet with the “trust species” concept alone. While management to benefit specific species offers a simple measure of accomplishment, as a policy tool it creates more problems than it solves. Adherence to the “trust species” theme limits full engagement with, and abdicates the FWS’ leadership role in, contemporary conservation challenges and science. This article makes the case for alternative measures of NWRS conservation success that move beyond just counting populations. We begin in Part I by tracing the rise of the trust concept to prominence as the dominant FWS conservation theme. We illustrate how the idea works in practice with three examples. In Part II we proceed to analyze what the “trust species” theme offers for conservation objectives and what problems it presents for the NWRS. We conclude that, on balance, its strengths do not justify its predominance. In particular, the trust concept has four problems. First, it fails to capture the full, systemic statutory mandate, and thus neglects an important part of Congress’ instructions. Second, it invites confusion with real federal trust duties pertaining to natural resources damages and relations with Indian tribes. Third, it risks conflation with state public <b>trust</b> <b>doctrines,</b> and therefore blurs the distinction between the FWS’ functions and the state role in wildlife management. Fourth, it narrows the FWS’ conservation vision to only a few elements of the broader ecological concerns animating landscape-level nature protection. Part III shows how climate change, ecosystem management, and land acquisition would be better addressed through a broader approach. We conclude with some suggestions for alternatives to the reductive “trust species” focus. Ecological integrity offers a more accurate theme for the NWRS goals, a more robust tool for adapting to climate change, and a concept that the scientific literature recognizes and quantifies...|$|R

50|$|In this case, the California courts {{resolved}} two issues: The {{first issue}} was, whether the Public <b>Trust</b> <b>Doctrine</b> functions {{independently of the}} California Water Rights System.

40|$|In July, 2013 Malawi {{enacted a}} new Companies Act [Act No. 15 of 2013] {{replacing}} the old Companies Act 19 of 1984. The Companies Act, 1984 was basically an {{adoption of the}} English Companies Act, 1948 and {{in line with the}} English law, it regulated distributions through the classical capital maintenance rule. In contrast, the new Companies Act, 2013 which came into force in May, 2016 has jettisoned the capital maintenance rule. As an alternative to that rule, the Act has introduced {{for the first time in}} Malawian company law edifice, the concept of the solvency test. Jurisdictions that have adopted the solvency test in their company law essentially have done so on the basis that company law should focus on the core risk at stake – company insolvency, and that it is meaningless to state that creditors look to the company's capital as a trust fund out which their debts would be settled. Despite having the same theoretical basis for adopting the solvency test, the manner in which the solvency test is defined and applied in a particular statute has significant effects on whether in its operation, the test affords adequate protection to the interests of creditors. This research examines the definition and application of the solvency test under the Companies Act, 2013 so as to determine whether in its operation as a financial restriction for distributions and other company transactions, it will afford adequate protection to creditors. It follows the approach used by Professor Kathleen Van der Linde in her analysis of the solvency and liquidity approach in the Companies Act, 2008. Thus, it analyses the Malawian law by focusing on the two separate elements of the test (equity solvency and balance sheet solvency) as well as other aspects of the test which are likely to raise legal interpretation issues. The twin solvency test adopted in different jurisdictions ordinarily varies in its balance sheet solvency element. Some jurisdictions such as South Africa and New Zealand utilise the net assets approach in their balance sheet test. Others such as New York and Delaware still emphasise on the <b>trust</b> fund <b>doctrine</b> and thus utilise stated capital in their balance sheet test. Malawi is a stated capital/surplus jurisdiction. Its new solvency based regime still focuses on the meaningless <b>trust</b> fund <b>doctrine.</b> The new solvency test approach in Malawi is incomplete and inadequate to fully protect creditors against opportunistic shareholder behaviour. A number of recommendations are made for an effective solvency test approach that will afford adequate protection to creditors against opportunistic shareholder behaviour...|$|R

50|$|Justice Field {{determined}} that the public <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine</b> applies to the Great Lakes, {{despite the fact that}} they are not subject to the ebb and flow of the tides. Initially, the United States adopted English Common law which limited the definition of navigable waters to those that were subject to the ebb and flow of the tides. In the United States the tidal requirement was removed because many rivers can be navigated for great distances by large commercial vessels. Great Lakes, while not subject to the tides, are the conduit of a great deal of transnational and interstate commerce, and it was this value the common law sought to protect in the public <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine.</b> The public <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine</b> limits private property rights to lands submerged by navigable waters.

DWP based their defense on the fact that they held permits, issued by the state for the diversions, and so the diversions were allowable. The central issue in the case was whether appropriative water rights (granted in the past) must consider the public <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine,</b> requiring protection of natural resources by the state. More specifically, the issue being addressed by the court was whether Mono Lake was subject to a public trust, which would invalidate Los Angeles’ use of the streams feeding the lake. The California Supreme Court held that the state, under the public <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine,</b> had continuing responsibility for the state's navigable waters and that the public <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine,</b> therefore, prevented any party from appropriating water in a manner that harmed the public trust interests. However, the court also recognized that LA depended on these diversions as a critical water source, and this in turn mitigated the rule of law as the court held that water transfers were permissible even though some damage to the environment would occur as long as this was kept to minimal harm to the extent feasible. This ruling established that the public <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine</b> and appropriative water rights are [...] "part of an integrated system of water law" [...] and so both must be considered when determining appropriate use of water in California.|$|E

Good works done without love means nothing.
