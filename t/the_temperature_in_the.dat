5|$|The hot carbon {{monoxide}} is the reducing {{agent for the}} iron ore and reacts with the iron oxide to produce molten iron and carbon dioxide. Depending on <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{different parts of the}} furnace (warmest at the bottom) the iron is reduced in several steps. At the top, where the temperature usually is in the range between 200°C and 700°C, the iron oxide is partially reduced to iron(II,III) oxide, Fe3O4.|$|E
5|$|Each engine main {{combustion}} chamber (MCC) receives fuel-rich hot gas from a hot-gas manifold cooling circuit. The gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen enter the chamber at the injector, which mixes the propellants. A small augmented-spark igniter-chamber {{is located in}} the center of the injector, and this dual-redundant igniter is used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion. The igniters are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is self-sustaining. The main injector and dome assembly are welded to the hot-gas manifold, and the MCC is also bolted to the hot-gas manifold. The MCC comprises a structural shell made of Inconel 718 which is lined with a copper-silver-zirconium alloy called NARloy-Z, developed specifically for the RS-25 in the 1970s. Around 390 channels are machined into the liner wall to carry liquid hydrogen through the liner to provide MCC cooling, as <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{combustion chamber}} reaches 3300°C (6000°F) during flight – higher than the boiling point of iron.|$|E
5|$|Main-sequence stars employ {{two types}} of {{hydrogen}} fusion processes, {{and the rate of}} energy generation from each type depends on <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> core region. Astronomers divide the main sequence into upper and lower parts, based on which of the two is the dominant fusion process. In the lower main sequence, energy is primarily generated {{as the result of the}} proton-proton chain, which directly fuses hydrogen together in a series of stages to produce helium. Stars in the upper main sequence have sufficiently high core temperatures to efficiently use the CNO cycle. (See the chart.) This process uses atoms of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen as intermediaries in the process of fusing hydrogen into helium.|$|E

In the upper cloud layers, with <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> range 100–160K and pressures extending between 0.5–2 bar, the clouds consist of ammonia ice. Water ice clouds begin at a level where the pressure is about 2.5 bar and extend down to 9.5 bar, where temperatures range from 185–270K. Intermixed in this layer is a band of ammonium hydrosulfide ice, lying in the pressure range 3–6 bar with temperatures of 190–235K. Finally, the lower layers, where pressures are between 10–20 bar and temperatures are 270–330K, contains a region of water droplets with ammonia in aqueous solution.|$|E

25|$|Initial phase: {{the bulb}} is driven with {{controlled}} overload. Because the arc is operated at high power, <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> capsule rises quickly.

40|$|Abstract. An {{investigation}} is reported of <b>the</b> <b>temperatures</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sawing of granite with a circular sawblade under {{a wide range}} of machining parameters including cutting fluids and cutting modes. <b>Temperature</b> responses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sawing contact zone were measured using a foil thermocouple.

For either down-cutting or up-cutting, either with cutting fluids or without cutting fluids, <b>the</b> <b>temperatures</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sawing zone were found to increase with depth of cut, sawblade speed, and workpiece speed. <b>The</b> maximum <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sawing without cutting fluids was found to be up to 400 °C whereas it was reduced to around 250 °C while using cutting fluids. The energy partition conducted to the workpiece is about 7 % ~ 10 % in dry sawing and about 2 % ~ 5 % in wet sawing...|$|R

25|$|The {{boundary}} layer shields {{and the oil}} film act as thermal insulation, leading to a low temperature of the lubricating film (maximum ~ on a water-cooled Wankel engine. This gives a more constant surface temperature.

25|$|After dry roasting, peanuts {{are removed}} from the oven as quickly as {{possible}} and directly placed in a blower-cooler cylinder. There are suction fans in the metal cylinder that can pull a large volume of air through, so the peanuts can be cooled more efficiently. The peanuts will not be dried out because cooling can help retain some oil and moisture. The cooling process is completed when <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cylinder reaches 30℃.|$|E
25|$|The {{onset of}} {{superconductivity}} {{is accompanied by}} abrupt changes in various physical properties, which {{is the hallmark of}} a phase transition. For example, the electronic heat capacity is proportional to <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> normal (non-superconducting) regime. At the superconducting transition, it suffers a discontinuous jump and thereafter ceases to be linear. At low temperatures, it varies instead as e−α/T for some constant, α. This exponential behavior is one of the pieces of evidence for the existence of the energy gap.|$|E
50|$|The {{evidence}} {{comes from}} a <b>temperature</b> reconstruction from <b>the</b> Euro-Med2k working group of the international PAGES (Past Global Changes) project, using new tree-ring measurements from the Altai Mountains, which closely matches <b>the</b> <b>temperatures</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Alps <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last two centuries.|$|R
40|$|A new {{approach}} for machining of Inconel 718 {{is presented in}} this paper. It combines traditional turning with cryogenically enhanced machining and plasma enhanced machining. Cryogenically enhanced machining is used to reduce <b>the</b> <b>temperatures</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cutting tool, and thus reduces temperature-dependent tool wear to prolong tool life, whereas plasma enhanced machining is used to increase <b>the</b> <b>temperatures</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workpiece to soften it. By joining these two non-traditional techniques with opposite effects on the cutting tool and the workpiece, {{it has been found}} that the surface roughness was reduced by 250 %; the cutting forces was decreased by approximately 30 – 50 %; and the tool life was extended up to 170 % over conventional machining...|$|R

25|$|The {{result is}} that the ratio in the liquid mixture is changing, {{becoming}} richer in component B. This causes the boiling point of the mixture to rise, which in turn results in a rise in <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vapor, which results in a changing ratio of A : B in the gas phase (as distillation continues, there is an increasing proportion of B in the gas phase). This results in a slowly changing ratio A : B in the distillate.|$|E
25|$|After some {{positive}} effect was noticed using both the core spray system and feed water piping, TEPCO decided on 16 September {{to increase the}} amount of water pumped into the No. 2 reactor by one ton, in an attempt to further lower <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> core, to a total of 7 tons per hour. The same was done for reactor No. 3, where 5 tons were added, bring the total to 12 tons per hour. TEPCO also added that the volume of cooling water into the No. 1 reactor would be increased as necessary.|$|E
25|$|On 14 September at 11AM (JST) TEPCO began injecting {{water into}} the No. 2 reactor using the core spray system piping in {{addition}} to the feed water piping already being used as this method seemed to be effective in reducing <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> No. 3 reactor. At that time the temperature {{at the bottom of the}} No. 2 reactor was still 114.4 degrees Celsius (237.92°F), compared to the 84.9°C degrees(184.82°F) in the No.1 reactor and the 101.3°C (214.34°F) in the No. 3 reactor. The new method has led to some temperature decrease, but not as significant as the decrease that occurred in the No.3 reactor.|$|E

25|$|It is {{estimated}} that the average global equilibrium temperature (<b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence of atmospheric effects) of Gliese 581g would range from 209 to 228K (−64 to −45°C, or −84 to −49°F) for Bond albedos (reflectivities) from 0.5 to 0.3 (with the latter being more characteristic of the inner Solar System). Adding an Earthlike greenhouse effect would yield an average surface temperature {{in the range of}} 236 to 261K (−37 to −12°C, or −35 to 10°F). Gliese 581g would be in an orbit where a silicate weathering thermostat could operate, and this could lead to accumulation of sufficient carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to permit liquid water to exist at the surface, provided the planet's composition and tectonic behavior could support sustained outgassing.|$|E
25|$|The 500 {{square meter}} {{facility}} of ABS-CBN Film Archives {{is covered with}} insulated walls. It has two film vaults: the medium-term vault and the long-term vault. The medium term vault holds betacam tapes, U-matic, 16mm negatives and prints, and some 35mm negatives and prints while the long-term vault holds the 35mm negatives and master prints. The facility is protected by a special fire suppression system. Acclimatization rooms are located between the vaults and the exit. Before a film could be taken out from the vault, it has {{to stay in the}} first acclimatization room for 24 hours and in the second acclimatization room for another 24 hours to prevent damage caused by condensation due to rapid temperature change. <b>The</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long-term vault is maintained between 8 and 10°C with 31 to 35 percent relative humidity while in the medium-term vault, the temperature is maintained between 15 and 20°C with 35 to 50 percent relative humidity. The air-conditioning system of the facility operates 24 hours a day. The facility is accessible to visitors for academic and research purposes.|$|E
25|$|On 3 July in the morning, a {{crack in}} a {{polyvinyl}} hose - 30 centimeters long and 7 centimeters wide - was found around the outlet of a temporary pump for seawater. At 10AM the pump was shut off, the cooling system of reactor 5 was halted 15 minutes later. The polyvinyl pipe was replaced, and the cooling system was restarted at 13:45PM. <b>The</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reactor rose some 5 degrees Celsius to 47.7 degrees Celsius. Constant tidal movements were probably {{the cause of the}} rupture of the pleated flexible tube. On 4 July TEPCO announced that all tubes and hoses used in the heat removal systems will be checked on possible weaknesses. Tubes like these, that were used to transfer highly radioactive water, did not require replacement because they were not bent at extreme angles. At 10:16 AM on 15 July, TEPCO completed repairs to Pump B of the original Residual Heat Removal Seawater System of Unit 5. The original seawater system was severely damaged in the tsunami requiring the temporary seawater pumps and hoses to be installed which have proven to be leak prone. At 2:45 PM on 15 July, TEPCO began pumping seawater through the residual heat removal heat exchanger with the newly repaired pump.|$|E
