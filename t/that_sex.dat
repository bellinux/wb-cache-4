5|$|Despite the {{profound}} advances made over recent decades {{in our understanding}} of life's fundamental processes, some basic problems have remained unresolved. One of the major unresolved problems in biology is the primary adaptive function of sex, and particularly its key processes in eukaryotes of meiosis and homologous recombination. One view is <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> evolved primarily as an adaptation that promoted increased genetic diversity (see references e.g.). An alternative view is <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> is an adaptation for promoting accurate DNA repair in germ-line DNA, and that increased genetic diversity is primarily a byproduct that may be useful in the long run. (See also Evolution of sexual reproduction).|$|E
5|$|However, {{contrary}} to {{the expectations of the}} Red Queen hypothesis, Hanley et al. found that the prevalence, abundance and mean intensity of mites was significantly higher in sexual geckos than in asexuals sharing the same habitat. Furthermore, Parker, after reviewing numerous genetic studies on plant disease resistance, failed to find a single example consistent with the concept that pathogens are the primary selective agent responsible for sexual reproduction in their host. At an even more fundamental level, Heng and Gorelick and Heng reviewed evidence <b>that</b> <b>sex,</b> rather than enhancing diversity, acts as a constraint on genetic diversity. They considered <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> acts as a coarse filter, weeding out major genetic changes, such as chromosomal rearrangements, but permitting minor variation, such as changes at the nucleotide or gene level (that are often neutral) to pass through the sexual sieve. The adaptive function of sex, today, remains a major unresolved issue in biology. The competing models to explain the adaptive function of sex were reviewed by Birdsell and Wills. A principal alternative view to the Red Queen hypothesis is <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> arose, and is maintained, as a process for repairing DNA damage, and that genetic variation is produced as a byproduct.|$|E
5|$|Foraging turtles {{frequently}} cross lakes {{or travel}} linearly down creeks. Daily crossings of large ponds have been observed. Tag and release studies show <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> also drives turtle movement. Males travel the most, up to , between captures; females the second most, up to , between captures; and juveniles the least, less than , between captures. Males move {{the most and}} {{are most likely to}} change wetlands because they seek mates.|$|E
50|$|The {{theory of}} parental {{investment}}, which predicts <b>that</b> the <b>sex</b> making the largest investment in lactation, nurturing and protecting offspring {{will be more}} discriminating in mating and <b>that</b> the <b>sex</b> <b>that</b> invests less in offspring will compete {{for access to the}} higher investing sex.|$|R
25|$|Robert Trivers' {{theory of}} parental {{investment}} predicts <b>that</b> the <b>sex</b> making the largest investment in lactation, nurturing and protecting offspring {{will be more}} discriminating in mating and <b>that</b> the <b>sex</b> <b>that</b> invests less in offspring will compete {{for access to the}} higher investing sex (see Bateman's principle). Sex differences in parental effort are important in determining the strength of sexual selection.|$|R
50|$|O'Neil and Kottak {{agree that}} most men marry and have {{heterosexual}} relations with their wives. The fear <b>that</b> heterosexual <b>sex</b> {{causes them to}} die earlier and the belief <b>that</b> homosexual <b>sex</b> prolongs life means that heterosexual relations are focused towards reproduction.|$|R
5|$|After the {{plaintiff}} rests, {{the defense lawyer}} calls Marcy, Al, and Peggy to the stand. She asks Marcy a series of embarrassing questions, hoping to prove Marcy knew that the camera was there. Her tactic with the Bundys {{is to try to}} prove sexual intercourse did not occur on the videotape. In the end, the Rhoades are awarded $10,000 but the Bundys receive nothing, because the jury does not believe <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> occurred. After everyone exits the courtroom, Al attempts to prove that he can perform when he wants to and has sex with Peggy for hours on the judge's bench, unwittingly while being recorded by the courtroom camera.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, Matilda Joslyn Gage {{took time}} {{out from her}} {{participation}} in the Revising Committee to write Woman, Church and State, a book which challenged traditional Judeo-Christian teaching that women were the source of sin, and <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> was sinful. Gage wrote that the double standard for morality hurt both sexes. Gage differed {{from most of the}} women on the Revising Committee in that she did not feel that the Bible, once interpreted in a more true, original form, would support women's rights. Gage determined that the Church had acted against women's interests in important ways: from Roman Catholic canon law, to Scripture, to its advocacy of celibacy and more. Especially troubling to Gage was the story of Adam and Eve.|$|E
5|$|In her interview, Swedish Detective Superintendent Kajsa Wahlberg {{describes}} purchasing sex from {{a prostitute}} as paying to masturbate into someone. The leader {{of an organization}} working to rescue girls from prostitution in Cambodia {{says that it is}} not the poorest parents who sell their children into sexual slavery but rather the parents who are looking to buy luxury goods. He therefore argues <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> trafficking is a spiritual and moral issue that cannot be solved by education or money. In another interview, a man purchasing sex in Thailand says that he believes the girls are happy to be working as prostitutes. Another interview features an American man who had been a sex tourist in Asia.|$|E

5|$|Nefarious {{asserts that}} there is a link between the {{international}} sex industry and legal prostitution in the Western world, and that those who create the demand for forced prostitution around the world are {{of a wide variety of}} ages and are often considered respectable. The film contrasts the secretiveness and brutality of the sex industry in Eastern Europe with the openness of public prostitution in the Netherlands. Nefarious suggests <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> trafficking in Southeast Asia is fuelled largely by the complicity of the victims' parents, with many in Cambodia grooming and then knowingly selling their daughters into prostitution to pay for luxury goods. The film asserts that 10% of the population of Moldova has been sexually trafficked. Nefarious contrasts Las Vegas prostitutes with victims of sex trafficking in Europe, depicting the former as drawn into the sex industry by dreams of a glamorous lifestyle, and the latter as made vulnerable by child abandonment and orphanages.|$|E
5|$|Not only do {{they affect}} injured people's self-image, these {{stereotypes}} are particularly harmful when held by counselors and professionals involved in rehabilitation. Caregivers affected by these culturally transmitted beliefs may treat their patients as asexual, particularly if the injury occurred {{at a young age}} and the patient never had sexual experiences. Failure to recognize injured people's sexual and reproductive capacity restricts their access to birth control, information about sexuality, and sexual health-related medical care such as annual gynecological exams. Another common belief that affects sexual rehabilitation is <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> is strictly about genital function; this could cause caregivers to discount the importance {{of the rest of the}} body and of the individual.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Jamie presents Dylan {{with the}} contract to sign so she can land her commission for recruiting him. Not knowing {{anyone else in the}} city, he and Jamie quickly develop a strong platonic friendship. One night, they get on the topic of sex and relationships. They come to the conclusion <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> should not come with so many emotional attachments. As they both feel the need for a physical connection, they agree to have sex without emotion or commitment. After several trysts together, Jamie comes to the realization that this is not really what she wants and she would like to start dating again. She tells Dylan that they need to stop.|$|E

Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny become big fans of the game. Meanwhile, scientists at the Center for Disease Control determine <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> addiction is a disease reaching epidemic proportions. They decide to screen schoolchildren for the disease, and Kenny, Kyle, and Butters are diagnosed as sex addicts. Kenny is killed after attempting autoerotic asphyxiation while in a Batman suit, while Kyle and Butters are sent to attend a therapy session for sex addicts consisting of Michael Douglas, Michael Jordan, Ben Roethlisberger, David Duchovny, Charlie Sheen, David Letterman, Bill Clinton, Billy Bob Thornton, Kobe Bryant, Eliot Spitzer, and Tiger Woods.|$|E

25|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} first probably evolved about {{a billion}} years ago within ancestral single-celled eukaryotes. The reason {{for the evolution of}} sex, and the reason(s) it has survived to the present, are still matters of debate. Some of the many plausible theories include: <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> creates variation among offspring, sex helps in the spread of advantageous traits, <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> helps in the removal of disadvantageous traits, and <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> facilitates repair of germ-line DNA.|$|E

Results stated that teenagers believed <b>that</b> oral <b>sex</b> for dating and non-dating adolescents was less threatening to their overall values and beliefs than vaginal sex was. When asked, teenagers who participated in the research viewed oral sex as more acceptable to their peers, and their personal values than vaginal sex.|$|R

50|$|Thus {{it may be}} said <b>that</b> {{determining}} the <b>sex</b> of children is actually a cultural act, and the sex of children is in fact socially constructed.

25|$|Wilhelm Reich commented <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> {{education}} {{of his time}} was a work of deception, focusing on biology while concealing excitement-arousal, which is what a pubescent individual is mostly interested in. Reich added that this emphasis obscures what he {{believed to be a}} basic psychological principle: that all worries and difficulties originate from unsatisfied sexual impulses. Leepson asserted that the majority of people favor some sort of sex instruction in public schools, and this has become an intensely controversial issue because, unlike most subjects, sex education is concerned with an especially sensitive and highly personal part of human life. He suggested <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> education should be taught in the classroom.|$|E
