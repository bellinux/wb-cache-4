This phenomenon is relevant for time management mechanics because their use usually implies immediate costs and only future benefits. If some people discount future outcomes more steeply than others, they should also discount the future benefits of using time management mechanics more steeply and consequently use time management mechanics less often. This hypothesis was tested among 153 German white-collar workers. The steepness of <b>time</b> <b>discounting</b> was inferred from two common behavioral tasks that are typically used to measure <b>time</b> <b>discounting.</b> The use of time management mechanics was assessed using the Mechanics subscale of the Time Management Behavior Scale.

To detect future bias, this experiment lets subjects compare two future reward options whose interval is shorter than 4 weeks. The new elicitation method is also independent of the confounding factors that are common in the existing experiments. Specifically, the method does not put any assumption on the form of utility function and does not assume that time and reward are separable either. This is a great advantage that enable us to estimate time preference more precisely...|$|E

40|$|We derive a {{tractable}} nonlinear earnings function {{which we}} estimate separately {{for each individual}} in the NLSY 79 data. These estimates yield five important parameters for each individual: three ability measures (two representing the ability to learn and one the ability to earn), a rate of skill depreciation, and a <b>time</b> <b>discount</b> rate. In addition, we obtain a population wide estimate of the rental rate of human capital. To illustrate heterogeneity {{in the production of}} human capital, we plot the distribution of these parameters along with NLSY 79 reported AFQT scores. By utilizing these parameters, we are able to verify a number of heretofore untested theorems based on the life-cycle human capital model. In addition, we are able to show how these human capital production function parameters relate to cognitive ability, personality traits, and family background. Among our results, we find: Black-white differences in ability are smaller than those exhibited in standardized tests. Blacks have higher <b>time</b> <b>discount</b> and skill depreciation rates than whites. Individuals with higher <b>time</b> <b>discount</b> rates and greater rates of skill depreciation have fewer years of school. Individuals with both a high internal locus of control and self-esteem exhibit greater ability, lower skill depreciation, and smaller <b>time</b> <b>discount</b> rates. Individuals inclined towards depression have higher <b>time</b> <b>discount</b> rates. Agreeable, open, conscientious and extrovert individuals have a greater ability to learn but not necessarily a greater ability to earn. Neurotic individuals have a lower ability to learn. Higher parental education is associated with a greater ability to learn, lower skill depreciation, and a smaller <b>time</b> <b>discount</b> rate.

40|$|The Time Tradeoff (TTO) {{method is}} a popular method for valuing health state {{utilities}} and is frequently used in economic evaluations. However, this method produces utilities that are distorted by several biases. One important bias entails the failure to incorporate <b>time</b> <b>discounting.</b> This paper aims to measure <b>time</b> <b>discounting</b> for health outcomes in a sample representative for the general population. In particular, we estimate TTO scores alongside <b>time</b> <b>discounting</b> in order to derive a set of correction factors that can be employed to correct raw TTO scores for the downward bias caused by <b>time</b> <b>discounting.</b> We find substantial positive correction factors, which are increasing with {{the severity of the}} health state. Furthermore, higher discounting is found when using more severe health states in the discounting elicitation task. More research is needed to further develop discount rate elicitation procedures and test their validity, especially in general public samples. Moreover, future research should investigate the correction of TTO score for other biases as well, such as loss aversion, and to develop a criterion to test the external validity of TTO scores. ...|$|R

We find very high rates of <b>time</b> <b>discount</b> in the financial realm for a horizon of one year, irrespective of smoking status. In the health domain, the implied rates of <b>time</b> <b>discount</b> decline with the length of the time delay (hyperbolic discounting) and the sign of the payoff (the sign effect). We use a series of questions about the willingness to undergo a colonoscopy to elicit short- and long-run rates of discount in a quasi-hyperbolic discounting framework, finding no evidence that short-run and long-run rates of discount differ by smoking status. Using more general measures of time preference, i. e., impulsivity and length of financial planning horizon, smokers are more impatient. However, neither of these measures is significantly correlated with the measures of time discounting. Our results indicate that subjective rates of <b>time</b> <b>discount</b> revealed through committed choice scenarios are not related to differences in smoking behavior. Rather, a combination of more general measures of time preference and selfcontrol, i. e., impulsivity and financial planning, are more closely related to the smoking decision...|$|E

30|$|Our review also {{emphasizes}} the importance of discount rates for policy making since high <b>time</b> <b>discount</b> rates can contribute to governmental emphasis on acute health care, rather than preventive health care. Therefore, providing policy makers with accurate estimates of societal and/or individual discount rates is extremely important given that discount rates reflect society’s preferences on how scarce resources should be utilized.

40|$|Many US {{government}} programs focus on reducing the financial barriers to homeownership. This paper uncovers {{evidence of an}} additional barrier - high <b>time</b> <b>discounting</b> by renters. Results from cumulative logistic and ordinary least squares models of 4228 households participating in the 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances indicate that renters self-report a significantly shorter financial planning time-horizon than owners do. Additionally, a tobit analysis reveals that renters tend to choose short-term, low-return investments when they save. A probit analysis of 14 743 household observations in the 2003 - 2004 Consumer Expenditure Survey reveals a significantly higher probability for consumption of tobacco by renters-a choice frequently associated with high <b>time</b> <b>discounting</b> due to negative long-term health effects. Each of these results is consistent with high <b>time</b> <b>discounting</b> by renters. Such discounting of future consequences can impede the transition to homeownership, which often requires delaying current consumption in exchange for future benefit. ...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} policy commitment to address the avoidable burdens of unhealthy diet, overweight and obesity. However, to design effective policies, {{it is important to}} understand why people make unhealthy dietary choices. Research from behavioural economics suggests a critical role for time discounting, which describes how people's value of a reward, such as better health, decreases with delay to its receipt. We systematically reviewed the literature on the relationship of time discounting with unhealthy diets, overweight and obesity in Web of Science and PubMed. We identified 41 studies that met our inclusion criteria as they examined the association between <b>time</b> <b>discount</b> rates and (i) unhealthy food consumption; (ii) overweight and (iii) response to dietary and weight loss interventions. Nineteen out of 25 cross-sectional studies found <b>time</b> <b>discount</b> rates positively associated with overweight, obesity and unhealthy diets. Experimental studies indicated that lower time discounting was associated with greater weight loss. Findings varied by how <b>time</b> <b>discount</b> rates were measured; stronger results were observed for food than monetary-based measurements. Network co-citation analysis revealed a concentration of research in nutrition journals. Overall, there is moderate evidence that high time discounting is a significant risk factor for unhealthy diets, overweight and obesity and may serve as an important target for intervention. © 2016 World Obesity...|$|E

40|$|The dynamic {{properties}} of the optimal growth model are examined, based on a one good and two factor-labor and capital [...] model with a labor-surplus economy due to a fixed wage rate. If the average capital productivity {{is higher than the}} <b>time</b> <b>discount</b> rate which is assumed to be larger than the population growth rate, then the economy reaches the full employment stationary state in a finite amount of time. If both are equal, then the economy stays in the initial state forever. If the average capital productivity is less than the population growth rate due to a high and fixed wage rate, then the economy is in the poverty trap where both per capita capital and per capita consumption shrink to zero as seen in many developing countries. If the average productivity is higher than population growth rate but lower than <b>time</b> <b>discount</b> rate, there can exist two different paths – one to stationary state and the other on the poverty trap – depending on the initial values of per capita capital if the elasticity of marginal felicity is less than one. Therefore the only strategy {{to get out of the}} poverty trap for the developing countries is to increase average capital productivity above the <b>time</b> <b>discount</b> rate indirectly by increasing labor productivity by means of a big push or imports of technology and/or by increasing per capita capital through imports of capital as a policy recommendation...|$|E
