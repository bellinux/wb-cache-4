40|$|This {{paper is}} a <b>transcript</b> <b>of</b> <b>testimony</b> by Professor J. Peter Byrne before the U. S. Civil Rights Commission on August 12, 2011. This hearing {{addresses}} {{claims that the}} use of eminent domain for economic development unfairly and disproportionately harms racial and ethnic minorities. These claims draw on the history of urban renewal prior to the 1960 ’s, when many African Americans and others were displaced by publicly funded projects that bulldozed their homes in largely failed attempts to modernize cities. Justice Clarence Thomas’s dissent in Kelo v. City of New London further argued {{that the use of}} eminent domain for economic redevelopment would inevitably harm minorities and the poor. Such concerns in our time are seriously misplaced. Redevelopment projects using eminent domain continue to be an invaluable tool for maintaining the economic competitiveness and livability of urban areas where property ownership is fragmented and where minorities live in large numbers. The discriminatory elements of older urban renewal reflect the racism generally prevalent in political life in the 1940 ’s and 50 ’s, and have been largely eliminated by the growth of political power by African Americans and other urban minorities, as well as the changed fiscal relations between the federal and local governments, the effect of which has been to give greater control over redevelopment projects to local political leaders. Use of eminent domain, rarely now applied to residences, today requires political consent and community buy-in...|$|E

40|$|The Schuelke Report {{about the}} ill-fated federal {{prosecution}} of the late-Senator Ted Stevens is an extraordinary contribution to criminal procedure. No other official documentation or investigative study of a criminal prosecution to my knowledge has dissected and analyzed as carefully and thoroughly the sordid and clandestine actions {{of a team of}} prosecutors who zealously wanted to win a criminal conviction at all costs. In examining this Report, one gets the feeling that as the investigation and prosecution of Senator Stevens unfolded, and the prosecution’s theory of guilt unraveled, the prosecutors became indifferent whether the defendant was really guilty; they just wanted to convict him. Based on depositions of these prosecutors, their emails, notes, memos, conversations, court filings, <b>transcripts</b> <b>of</b> <b>testimony,</b> and oral arguments, the Schuelke Report methodically and exhaustively documents the way these prosecutors manipulated flimsy, ambiguous, and unfavorable evidence, systematically concealed exculpatory evidence from the defense and the jury, and thwarted defense attempts to locate that evidence in order to convict a United States Senator and destroy his career...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{concept of}} {{engineering}} thinking in emergency situations addresses an epistemological {{gap in the}} field of safety sciences, following the accident at Fukushima Dai Ichi.

Rusesabagina's claim that he protected Tutsis at the hotel are without foundation.
