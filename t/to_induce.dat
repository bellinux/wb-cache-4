5|$|Dendritic cells {{bridge the}} {{innate immune system}} and {{adaptive}} immune system. They are increased in psoriatic lesions and induce the proliferation of T cells and type 1 helper T cells (Th1). Targeted immunotherapy as well as psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy can {{reduce the number of}} dendritic cells and favors a Th2 cell cytokine secretion pattern over a Th1/Th17 cell cytokine profile. Psoriatic T cells move from the dermis into the epidermis and secrete interferon-γ and interleukin-17. Interleukin-23 is known <b>to</b> <b>induce</b> the production of interleukin-17 and interleukin-22. Interleukin-22 works in combination with interleukin-17 <b>to</b> <b>induce</b> keratinocytes to secrete neutrophil-attracting cytokines.|$|E
5|$|LTP can {{be induced}} either by strong tetanic {{stimulation}} {{of a single}} pathway to a synapse, or cooperatively via the weaker stimulation of many. When one pathway into a synapse is stimulated weakly, it produces insufficient postsynaptic depolarization <b>to</b> <b>induce</b> LTP. In contrast, when weak stimuli are applied to many pathways that converge on a single patch of postsynaptic membrane, the individual postsynaptic depolarizations generated may collectively depolarize the postsynaptic cell enough <b>to</b> <b>induce</b> LTP cooperatively. Synaptic tagging, discussed later, may be a common mechanism underlying associativity and cooperativity. Bruce McNaughton argues that any difference between associativity and cooperativity is strictly semantic.|$|E

Doing {{any one of}} {{a number}} of acts <b>to</b> <b>induce</b> a person to vote or refrain from voting or to reward him for having done so, such as giving or lending money; and giving or {{procuring}} an office or employment, amounts to bribery.

5|$|The {{synaptic}} tag hypothesis {{may also}} account for LTP's associativity and cooperativity. Associativity (see Properties) is observed when one synapse is excited with LTP-inducing stimulation while a separate synapse is only weakly stimulated. Whereas {{one might expect}} only the strongly stimulated synapse to undergo LTP (since weak stimulation alone is insufficient <b>to</b> <b>induce</b> LTP at either synapse), both synapses will in fact undergo LTP. While weak stimuli are unable <b>to</b> <b>induce</b> protein synthesis in the cell body, they may prompt the synthesis of a synaptic tag. Simultaneous strong stimulation of a separate pathway, capable of inducing cell body protein synthesis, then may prompt the production of plasticity-related proteins, which are shipped cell-wide. With both synapses expressing the synaptic tag, both would capture the protein products resulting in the expression of LTP in both the strongly stimulated and weakly stimulated pathways.|$|E

Methods Genotype effects on ADAS-Cog scores from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in mild to moderate AD were examined by an overall two way analysis of variance. In addition, interactions with the carriage status of the epsilon 4 allele of the APOE gene (APOE 4) were examined. Results Significant differences in response <b>to</b> <b>induced</b> ketosis were found among non-carriers of putative gain-of-function polymorphisms in rs 1143627 and rs 16944 in the IL 1 B gene and among variants of the polymorphism rs 2251101 in the IDE gene. Significant differences were found among non-carriers of the APOE 4 gene, with notable improvement among the E 3 /E 3 genotype group. Conclusions Variants in APOE, IL 1 B and IDE may influence the cognitive response <b>to</b> <b>induced</b> ketosis in patients with mild to moderate AD.
