25|$|The Great Depression created {{economic}} obstacles for the park, and Owen {{lost her}} congressional seat. Coe, however, worked tirelessly for the park's establishment in Washington D.C. He sent coconuts to congressmen, President Herbert Hoover, and the Secretary of the Interior. While {{the concept of}} what landscapes were worth protecting were developing {{in the minds of}} scientists and politicians, Coe used any tactic he could <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> advance the idea of Everglades National Park, even equating its powers with the mythical Fountain of Youth. He took Congressional appointees from the Department of the Interior on tours through the Everglades, and though attempts to establish the park failed twice, it finally passed in May 1934. It carried a provision that the federal government would not be responsible for buying lands for the park, but its establishment ensured that no more land would be purchased from the protected area. Removing the prospect of developing lands in South Florida angered many state politicians. Newly elected governor Fred P. Cone fired Coe and left the Everglades Tropic National Park Commission without any guidance.|$|E
25|$|Mrs Cecilia Dribelle (Carol MacReady) - The extravagantly dressed businesswoman {{from whom}} Bodger rents his flat in Series 6 and 7. She has a {{distinct}} dislike for animals (apart from cats) and forbids her tenants from keeping pets, resulting in Bodger having to constantly hide Badger whenever she visits. She dislikes Bodger intensely and tries everything she can <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> evict him, she also expressed a dislike for pop music in one episode. She is fond of cakes and biscuits, and likes to make lots of money from silly ideas. She is nicknamed 'Mrs Dribble' and 'Dribbly Bibbly' by Badger. She drives around {{in a car with}} the registration plate 'DRIB 1' and has a cat called Fluffykins. In her early episodes she is made aware of Badger's presence by her sidekick, Elton, but never actually sees him as Elton's plans to catch Badger always fail. She eventually decides that Elton is imagining Badger. However, she has spotted Badger herself on several occasions - in one episode she saw Badger when she got knocked out, mistakenly thinking that Badger was her pet cat Fluffykins. Another was when Fluffykins had disappeared and Badger was inside the cat box pretending to be Fluffykins. Another time was when Badger was hiding behind a picture frame which Mrs Dribelle thought was a picture of a Badger. After spending the majority of Series 6 trying to find ways to evict Bodger, Mrs Dribelle later employs him as her handyman in Series 7. Later on she allowed her niece, Vicky, to stay in the first floor flat above Bodger's after she evicted Alec Smart. After Vicky left to go touring with a band, Mrs Dribelle temporarily moved into the vacant flat while her house was being decorated.|$|E

The album {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics; Christine Klunk of PopMatters commented [...] "I'm {{not in the least}} bit interested in where this band goes or what new and exciting ways they'll <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> abuse the listeners," [...] while Johnny Loftus of AllMusic felt it was a [...] "blazing new beginning".|$|E

500|$|Film analyst Lina Badley {{has written}} that the Alien's design, with strong Freudian sexual undertones, {{multiple}} phallic symbols, and overall feminine figure, provides an androgynous image conforming to archetypal mappings and imageries in horror films that often redraw gender lines. O'Bannon himself later described the sexual imagery in Alien as overt and intentional: [...] "One thing that people are all disturbed about is sex... I said 'That's how I'm going to attack the audience; I'm going to attack them sexually. And I'm {{not going to go}} after the women in the audience, I'm going to attack the men. I am going to put in every image I can <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> make the men in the audience cross their legs. Homosexual oral rape, birth. The thing lays its eggs down your throat, the whole number.|$|E

2500|$|Describing his {{gameplay}} {{strategy in}} 1930, he said, [...] "My system was all offense. I believed in {{putting up a}} mental hazard for the other fellow. If we were five or six runs ahead, I'd try some wild play, such as going from first to home on a single. This helped to make the other side hurry the play in a close game later on. I worked out all the angles I could <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> <b>to</b> keep them guessing and hurrying." [...] In the same interview, Cobb talked about having noticed a throwing tendency of first baseman Hal Chase, but having to wait two full years until the opportunity came to exploit it. By unexpectedly altering his own baserunning tendencies, {{he was able to}} surprise Chase and score the winning run of the game in question.|$|E
60|$|It is {{a natural}} impulse, in every one, when they hear a tale <b>of</b> distress, <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> say by way of consolation.

2500|$|Reed {{established}} himself as {{a force to be reckoned}} with while competing in Bill Watts’ Mid-South Wrestling from 1983 through early 1986. In Mid-South, he was known as “Hacksaw" [...] Butch Reed and came into the territory as a tag team partner for the main face in the territory the Junkyard Dog. Reed immediately came face to face with [...] "Hacksaw" [...] Jim Duggan over the “Hacksaw" [...] nickname. Back in 1983, Duggan was part of the heel group the [...] "Rat Pack" [...] along with Ted DiBiase and Matt Borne and used every dirty move he could <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> beat Butch Reed. Reed and Duggan would feud over the “Hacksaw" [...] name until Jim Duggan turned face. Duggan’s face turn resulted in Butch Reed’s heel turn when Duggan was picked to be the Junkyard Dog’s tag team partner over Reed.|$|E
2500|$|Joan Quigley {{first met}} Nancy Reagan in the 1970s on The Merv Griffin Show. After Ronald Reagan became president, {{and after the}} attempt on his life on March 30, 1981, Nancy asked Quigley {{if she could have}} foreseen, and {{possibly}} prevented, the assassination attempt. Quigley answered affirmatively, saying that she could have done so had she been looking at the time. At that point, Nancy Reagan enlisted Quigley's astrological advice on a regular basis, and held frequent telephone conversations with Quigley. Explaining why she turned to Quigley, Nancy later wrote, [...] "Very few people can understand what it's like to have your husband shot at and almost die, and then have him exposed all the time to enormous crowds, tens of thousands of people, any one of whom might be a lunatic with a gun.... I was doing everything I could <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> protect my husband and keep him alive." ...|$|E
2500|$|These {{celebrations}} {{can last}} from a day {{up to the}} entire week, and the New Year is filled {{with people in the}} streets trying to make as much noise as possible using firecrackers, drums, bells, gongs, and anything they can <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> ward off evil spirits. [...] This parade will also include different masks, and dancers hidden under the guise of {{what is known as the}} Mua Lan or Lion Dancing. [...] The Lan is an animal between a lion and a dragon, and is the symbol of strength in the Vietnamese culture that is used to scare away evil spirits. [...] After the parade, families and friends come together to have a feast of traditional Vietnamese dishes, and share the happiness and joy of the New Year with one another. [...] This is also the time when the elders will hand out red envelopes with money to the children for good luck in exchange for Tết greetings.|$|E
