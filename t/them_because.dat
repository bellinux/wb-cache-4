5|$|Fin skeletons are {{elongated}} {{and supported}} with soft and unsegmented rays named ceratotrichia, filaments of elastic protein resembling the horny keratin in hair and feathers. Most sharks have eight fins. Sharks can only drift away from objects {{directly in front}} of <b>them</b> <b>because</b> their fins do not allow them to move in the tail-first direction.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{began to}} develop severe stomach pains, but refused to see a doctor. He distrusted <b>them</b> <b>because</b> his {{brother-in-law}} had died after having a pacemaker installed. It was speculated among friends that the pains were from cancer, but {{they could have been}} an acid condition.|$|E
5|$|New World {{vultures}} are not {{closely related}} to Old World vultures, but superficially resemble <b>them</b> <b>because</b> of convergent evolution. Like the Old World vultures, they are scavengers. Unlike Old World vultures, which find carcasses by sight, New World vultures have {{a good sense of}} smell with which they locate carcasses.|$|E

5|$|Almost all the shrines are nondescript small {{rectangular}} buildings {{without any}} ornamentation. There is no representative of deities adorning {{the outside of}} the buildings. This is in contrast to any other Hindu temple in Sri Lanka or India. Almost all shrines are built of stone except that one dedicated to Valli which shows timber construction. They have been left as originally constructed and there are not any plans to improve upon <b>them,</b> <b>because</b> people are reluctant to tamper with the original shrine complex.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difference}} in Troilus' characterisation from the Filostrato {{is that he}} is no longer misogynistic in the beginning. Instead of mocking lovers because of their putting trust in women, he mocks <b>them</b> <b>because</b> of how love affects them. Troilus' vision of love is stark: total commitment offers total fulfilment; any form of failure means total rejection. He is unable to comprehend the subtleties and complexities that underlie Criseyde's vacillations and Pandarus' manoeuvrings.|$|E
5|$|At the Lannister army camp, Lord Tywin Lannister and his {{followers}} discuss their recent setbacks: not only have they lost an important battle, and Jaime, to the Starks, along with his entire army, but both Baratheon brothers now also threaten <b>them.</b> <b>Because</b> his grandson's execution of Ned Stark destroyed any hope to sue for peace between the Starks and the Lannisters, Tywin orders his son Tyrion to go to King's Landing in his stead as Hand of the King {{in order to keep}} Joffrey under control. Against his father's orders, Tyrion brings the prostitute Shae with him to the capital.|$|E

There {{was my own}} two boys a-struggling for their lives, and I couldn't lend a hand to help <b>'em,</b> <b>because</b> I was hampered by that white-faced thing.

5|$|Bernsten said audiences {{contemporaneous}} {{with the}} first season of Saturday Night Live were not ready for such characters. He said The Land of Gorch characters behaved so uncannily that audiences did not relate to <b>them</b> <b>because</b> they did not foresee hideous puppets behaving in such a mature manner. Bernsten said this was the reason the characters' pithy one-liner jokes succeeded.|$|E
5|$|Dobroselova {{considers}} {{moving to}} another part of the city where she can work as a governess. Just as he is out of money and risks being evicted, Devushkin has a stroke of luck: his boss takes pity on him and gives him 100 rubles to buy new clothes. Devushkin pays off his debts and sends some to Dobroselova. She sends him 25 rubles back because she does not need it. The future looks bright for both of <b>them</b> <b>because</b> he can now start to save money and it may be possible for them to move in together.|$|E
5|$|Heffernan v. City of Paterson, 578 U.S. ___ (2016), was a United States Supreme Court case in 2016 {{concerning}} the First Amendment rights of public employees. By a 6–2 margin, the Court {{held that a}} public employee's constitutional rights might be violated when an employer, believing that the employee was engaging in what would be protected speech, disciplines <b>them</b> <b>because</b> of that belief, even if the employee did not exercise such a constitutional right.|$|E

5|$|Not {{listed below}} are Hugh Magnus, eldest son of Robert II, and Philip of France, eldest son of Louis VI; both were co-kings {{with their fathers}} (in {{accordance}} with the early Capetian practice whereby kings would crown their heirs in their own lifetimes and share power with the co-king), but predeceased <b>them.</b> <b>Because</b> neither Hugh nor Philip were sole or senior king in their own lifetimes, they are not traditionally listed as Kings of France, and are not given ordinals.|$|E
5|$|Osmium tetroxide {{has been}} used in {{fingerprint}} detection and in staining fatty tissue for optical and electron microscopy. As a strong oxidant, it cross-links lipids mainly by reacting with unsaturated carbon–carbon bonds and thereby both fixes biological membranes in place in tissue samples and simultaneously stains <b>them.</b> <b>Because</b> osmium atoms are extremely electron-dense, osmium staining greatly enhances image contrast in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies of biological materials. Those carbon materials have otherwise very weak TEM contrast (see image). Another osmium compound, osmium ferricyanide (OsFeCN), exhibits similar fixing and staining action.|$|E
5|$|Primary Secretory Otitis Media (PSOM), {{also known}} as glue ear, {{consists}} of a highly viscous mucus plug which fills the dog's middle ear and may cause the tympanic membrane to bulge. PSOM has been reported almost exclusively in Cavaliers, and it may affect over half of <b>them.</b> <b>Because</b> the pain and other sensations {{in the head and}} neck areas, resulting from PSOM, are similar to some symptoms caused by syringomyelia (SM), some examining veterinarians have mis-diagnosed SM in Cavaliers which actually have PSOM and not SM.|$|E

I can't help being sorry for the dogs always, though perhaps there's no need.

5|$|Sea lions are {{particularly}} intelligent, {{can be trained}} to perform various tasks and display limited fear of humans if accustomed to <b>them.</b> <b>Because</b> of this, California sea lions are a popular choice for public display in zoos, circuses and oceanariums, and are trained by the United States Navy for certain military operations. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as Least Concern due to its abundance. Predation by California sea lions on threatened or endangered salmon species at Bonneville Dam has resulted in more than 50 of them being killed by state officials.|$|E

5|$|The ship crosses an ice {{barrier and}} arrives in open sea, {{close to the}} South Pole, albeit with a mild climate. Here the Jane Guy comes upon a mysterious island called Tsalal, {{inhabited}} by a tribe of black, apparently friendly natives led by a chief named Too-Wit. The color white is alien to the island's inhabitants and unnerves <b>them,</b> <b>because</b> nothing that color exists there. Even the natives' teeth are black. The island {{is also home to}} many undiscovered species of flora and fauna. Even its water is different from water elsewhere, being strangely thick and exhibiting multicolored veins.|$|E
5|$|Vulcanoids, {{should they}} exist, would be {{difficult}} to detect due to the strong glare of the nearby Sun, and ground-based searches can only be carried out during twilight or during solar eclipses. Several searches during eclipses were conducted in the early 1900s, which did not reveal any vulcanoids, and observations during eclipses remain a common search method. Conventional telescopes cannot be used to search for <b>them</b> <b>because</b> the nearby Sun could damage their optics.|$|E
5|$|After two Kaqchikel {{messengers}} sent by Pedro de Alvarado {{were killed}} by the Tz'utujil, the conquistadors and their Kaqchikel allies marched against the Tz'utujil. Pedro de Alvarado led 60 cavalry, 150 Spanish infantry and an unspecified number of Kaqchikel warriors. The Spanish and their allies arrived at the lakeshore after a day's march, and Alvarado rode ahead with 30 cavalry along the lake shore until he engaged a hostile Tz'utujil force, which was broken by the Spanish charge. The survivors were pursued across a causeway to an island on foot before the inhabitants could break the bridges. The rest of Alvarado's army soon arrived and they successfully stormed the island. The surviving Tz'utujil fled into the lake and swam to safety. The Spanish could not pursue <b>them</b> <b>because</b> 300 canoes sent by the Kaqchikels had not yet arrived. This battle took place on 18 April.|$|E
