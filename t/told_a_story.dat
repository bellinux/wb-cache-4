5|$|An avid {{baseball}} fan, Maxwell {{was among}} {{the founders of the}} Winnipeg Arena baseball club in 1908, and became the team's manager in 1912. At its peak, the team drew as many as 5,000 fans per game. As a player, manager or general manager, Maxwell was a member of eight Arena teams that won the Winnipeg city championship between 1908 and 1923. He was known for his quick, and often barbed, wit; His friends often <b>told</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> of an Arenas baseball game where, after failing to convince the umpire that it was too dark to play, Maxwell sent his players onto the field with lighted candles. In his later years, he served on the advisory board of the Winnipeg Goldeyes professional club.|$|E
5|$|His {{first study}} of {{mathematics}} began with papers by George Pólya {{and by the}} crystallographer Friedrich Haag on plane symmetry groups, sent {{to him by his}} brother Berend, a geologist. He carefully studied the 17 wallpaper groups, and created periodic tilings with 43 drawings of different types of symmetry. From this point on he developed a mathematical approach to expressions of symmetry in his art works using his own notation. Starting in 1937, he created woodcuts based on the 17 groups. His Metamorphosis I (1937) began a series of designs that <b>told</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> through the use of pictures. In Metamorphosis I, he transformed convex polygons into regular patterns in a plane to form a human motif. He extended the approach in his piece Metamorphosis III, which is four metres long.|$|E

25|$|Each one of Poussin's {{paintings}} <b>told</b> <b>a</b> <b>story.</b> Though he {{had little}} formal education, Poussin became very knowledgeable in the nuances of religious history, mythology and classical literature, and, usually after consulting with his clients, took his subjects from these topics. Many of his paintings combined several different incidents, occurring at different times, into the same painting, in order to tell the story, and the affetti, or facial expressions of the participants, showed their different reactions. Aside from his self-portraits, Poussin never painted contemporary subjects.|$|E

They <b>told</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about escaping from the British who wanted their vessel. The story was believed, and all were sent to an ordinary POW camp. If not, they surely would have been executed. By coincidence they met the crew from the Frøya raft in the camp, and joined them until the war ended.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, an ATV-produced {{television}} series Forever Love Song <b>told</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> {{of a character}} which was loosely based on that of Mui, but the character names were purposely changed. In 2007, a {{television series}} was produced in China titled Anita Mui Fei (梅艷芳菲) to tell the many dramas in her life. The 42 episode series was broadcast by China Education Television. Some subjects, such as her suffering from cancer, Leslie Cheung's suicide and her mother's real estate dilemma, were avoided. Alice Chan (陳煒) portrayed Mui in the series.|$|E
25|$|The cotton gin is a {{mechanical}} device that removes the seeds from cotton, {{a process that}} had previously been extremely labor-intensive. The word gin is short for engine. The cotton gin was a wooden drum stuck with hooks that pulled the cotton fibers through a mesh. The cotton seeds would not fit through the mesh and fell outside. Whitney occasionally <b>told</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> wherein he was pondering an improved method of seeding the cotton when he was inspired by observing a cat attempting to pull a chicken through a fence, and could only pull through some of the feathers.|$|E

25|$|Wilson {{recommended}} Kiggell as {{his successor}} and thought {{the appointment of}} William Robertson “a tremendous gamble”, writing “my heart sinks when I think what it all may mean to the College & this house”. He may have felt that Robertson’s lack of private means did not suit him for a position which required entertaining. Robertson visited Camberley with Lord Kitchener (28 July 1910), who criticised Wilson; {{this may have been}} one of the causes of the poor relations between Wilson and Kitchener in August 1914. Edmonds later <b>told</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> of how Wilson had, perhaps as a joke or wanting to draw attention to Robertson’s shortage of money, left a bill for £250 for furniture and improvements to the Commandant’s residence, and that Wilson’s predecessor Rawlinson, when approached by Robertson for advice, had been amused and had commented that many of these improvements had been made by his own wife or by previous Commandants. Whatever the truth of the matter, relations between Wilson and Robertson deteriorated thereafter.|$|E
25|$|On October 17, 2017 Frank Ocean's dad, Calvin Cooksey, sued Frank {{on charges}} of {{defamation}} and other damages with restitution payments reaching up to 14.5 million dollars. The issue started when Frank Ocean wrote a post in his personal Tumblr responding to the Pulse Nightclub shooting back in June 2016 and <b>told</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about how {{when he was a}} kid, he heard his father use a transphobic slur towards a waitress. The post stated that:'I was six years old when I heard my dad call our transgender waitress a f***** as he dragged me out a neighborhood diner saying we wouldn’t be served because she was dirty. 'That was the last afternoon I saw my father and the first time I heard that word, I think, although it wouldn’t shock me if it wasn’t. Many hate us and wish we didn’t exist.' The judge ended up ruling in favor of Frank Ocean and the case was put to an end.|$|E
25|$|The Golden Girls {{was shot}} on {{videotape}} {{in front of}} a live studio audience. Many episodes of the series followed a similar format or theme. For example, {{one or more of the}} women would become involved in some sort of problem, often involving other family members, men, or an ethical dilemma. At some point, they would gather around the kitchen table and discuss the problem, sometimes late at night and often while eating cheesecake or some other dessert. One of the other girls then <b>told</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> from her own life, which somehow related to the problem (though Rose occasionally regaled a nonsense story that had nothing to do with the situation, and Sophia told outrageous made-up stories). Some episodes featured flashbacks to previous episodes, flashbacks to events not shown in previous episodes, or to events that occurred before the series began. Though the writing was mostly comical, dramatic moments and sentimental endings were included in several episodes. One of the actresses on the show, Bea Arthur, actually hated cheesecake.|$|E

25|$|The show {{went into}} hiatus late in 1979 when Garner {{was told by}} his doctors {{to take time off}} because of {{numerous}} knee injuries and back trouble, as well as an ulcer. He sustained the former conditions largely because of his insistence on performing most of his own stunts, especially those involving fist fights or car chases. Because of his physical pain, Garner eventually opted not to continue with the show some months later, and NBC cancelled the program in mid-season. It was alleged that Rockford had become very expensive to produce, mainly due to the location filming and use of high-end actors as guest stars. According to sources, NBC and Universal claimed the show was generating a deficit of several million dollars, a staggering amount for a nighttime show at the time, although Garner and his production team Cherokee Productions claimed the show turned a profit. Garner <b>told</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> to Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show that the studio once paid a carpenter $700 to build a shipping crate for a shoot-out on a boat dock, though there were shipping crates on the dock. The script often called for Garner to damage his car, so the car could be sold, repaired, and repurchased for each episode.|$|E
500|$|In his 1977 book Nightside of Eden, the Thelemite Kenneth Grant, then {{leader of}} the Typhonian OTO, <b>told</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> in which he claimed that both he and Gardner {{performed}} rituals in the St. Giles flat of a [...] "Mrs. South", probably a reference to Montalban, who often used the pseudonym of [...] "Mrs North". The truthfulness of Grant's claims have been scrutinised by both Doreen Valiente and Julia Philips, who have pointed out multiple incorrect assertions with his account.|$|E
500|$|Notwithstanding his {{shooting}} prowess, Roberts {{was also}} well regarded for his stamina and skating ability, {{as well as}} being an above-average defensive checker. Despite being a physical player, Roberts (like his contemporary Frank Nighbor) was noted for his gentlemanly conduct on the ice – which he may have used to protect himself from retaliation. Montreal Canadiens bench boss George Kennedy <b>told</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> of a game against the Montreal Wanderers in which Didier Pitre was being tripped and butt-ended by the rugged Wanderers winger: ...|$|E

500|$|Childe {{was fond}} of driving cars, enjoying the [...] "feeling of power" [...] he got from them. He often <b>told</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about how he had raced at high speed down Piccadilly, London at 3 {{o'clock in the morning}} for the sheer {{enjoyment}} of it, only to be pulled over by a policeman for such illegal activity. He loved practical jokes, and allegedly kept a halfpenny in his pocket to trick pickpockets. On another occasion he played a joke on the delegates at a Prehistoric Society conference by lecturing them on a theory that the Neolithic monument of Woodhenge had been constructed as an imitation of Stonehenge by a nouveau riche chieftain. Several audience members failed to realise that he was being tongue in cheek.|$|E
500|$|He was {{a member}} of the Kappa Sigma fraternity. Nashville sportswriter Fred Russell, who entered Vanderbilt in 1924, <b>told</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about Bomar in his {{autobiography}} Bury Me In An Old Press Box: [...] "As a freshman I had pledged Kappa Sigma fraternity, which at that time had many varsity athletes. Among them was Lynn Bomar, selected All-American end in 1923... I also had the responsibility, as a freshman, of awakening Bomar in time for him to get to classes, and at the end of the school year I did this one morning by rolling the biggest lighted firecracker I ever saw under his bed. When it exploded I feared the whole corner of the fraternity house had been blown off, and I was so scared that even Bomar in his BVD's chasing me across the street and deep into the campus couldn't catch me." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{seeking to}} {{establish}} through song Liliom's {{motivation for the}} robbery, Rodgers remembered that he and Hart had a similar problem in Pal Joey. [...] Rodgers and Hart had [...] overcome the problem [...] with a song that Joey sings to himself, [...] "I'm Talking to My Pal". [...] This inspired [...] "Soliloquy". [...] Both partners later <b>told</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> that [...] "Soliloquy" [...] was only {{intended to be a}} song about Liliom's dreams of a son, but that Rodgers, who had two daughters, insisted that Liliom consider that Julie might have a girl. [...] However, the notes taken at their meeting of December 7, 1943 state: [...] "Mr. Rodgers suggested a fine musical number {{for the end of the}} scene where Liliom discovers he is to be a father, in which he sings first with pride of the growth of a boy, and then suddenly realizes it might be a girl and changes completely." ...|$|E
