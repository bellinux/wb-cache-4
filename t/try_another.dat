Oil freezing in the DB 605 engines of the Bf109G-6s made them difficult {{to start in}} the extreme cold of the Russian winter. A captured Soviet airman showed them how pouring fuel into the aircraft's oil sump would thaw the oil and enable the engine to start on the first <b>try.</b> <b>Another</b> solution, also learned from the Soviets, was to ignite fuel under the engine.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} {{in the village of}} Etene, {{focusing}} on the protagonist, an orphan living with their sibling. The peace is shattered when Nelgel, the Lord of Hell, attacks the village. The protagonist's soul is transported to a shrine and placed within the body of a member of the five non-human tribes, while their sister is transported to the past to protect her from Nelgel. Under the guidance of a sage, the protagonist travels Astoltia searching for sacred emblems with which to reach Nelgel's lair. After collecting six out of ten emblems, the sage attempts to form a bridge to Nelgel's laier. This fails, and he decides to separate the protagonist's soul from their body {{in a desperate attempt to}} <b>try</b> <b>another</b> method. This proves to be successful, as the protagonist then meets the body's original owner.|$|E
5|$|Wes grabs {{a can of}} {{gasoline}} and pours a trail from the Jeep to the woods. They lure the Grizzly Bear to it and then set the gasoline on fire. The Jeep explodes, but the bear is unharmed. They decide to <b>try</b> <b>another</b> plan and split up. Wes climbs a tree, leaving his blood covered clothes {{on the ground to}} fool the Bear. While the Bear is sniffing at the clothes, Wes accidentally drops a tire iron, calling the bear's attention up. The bear shakes him out of the tree but he escapes and goes to the shack where Lauren has built a trap. They lure the bear into the shack, and use a trigger to close the front door behind it, locking it in. They celebrate and start to leave but the bear breaks out of the shack and they both try to escape. Unfortunately, Wes stumbles and Lauren tries to get him back up, refusing to leave him behind despite his desperate insistence that she should run. The Bear catches up to them and presumably kills them both.|$|E

25|$|Early in 1954, visiting Paris, Stuart {{first saw}} the Impressionist {{paintings}} at the Jeu de Paume museum. As when she first saw découpage, Stuart wanted to do it, too. The Sheekmans {{were on their way}} to Italy. At the time, American artists living abroad for at least eighteen months paid no taxes on income earned during the residency. Sheekman was now very successful. In the eight years since returning from New York, he had been on fourteen movies, mostly writing the screenplays. He wanted to <b>try</b> <b>another</b> play.

On third and 1, Harbaugh was stuffed for no gain by linebacker Jack Del Rio, and Neal Anderson was dropped by lineman Tony Tolbert on the next play. This {{experience}} would be repeated later when Chicago drove 77 yards to the 2-yard line again, with rookie Darren Lewis rushing four times for 37 yards and catching a pass for 11. On second and goal, Norton tackled Anderson at the 1, and then he and Tolbert dropped Anderson for no gain on the next play. Rather than <b>try</b> <b>another</b> fourth down conversion, Chicago settled for Kevin Butler's 19-yard field goal to make the score 10-3 with 15 {{seconds left in the}} half.|$|E
25|$|The Albanian {{revolt of}} 1910 was {{reaction}} to the new centralization policies of the Young Turk Ottoman government in Albania. It {{was the first of}} a series of major uprisings. Rebels were supported by the Kingdom of Serbia. New taxes levied in the early months of 1910 led to Isa Boletini's activity to convince Albanian leaders who had already been involved in a 1909 uprising to <b>try</b> <b>another</b> revolt against the Ottoman Empire. The Albanian attacks on the Ottomans in Priştine (now Pristina) and Ferizovik (now Ferizaj), the killing of the Ottoman commander in İpek (now Peć), and the insurgents' blocking of the railway to Skopje at the Kaçanik Pass led to the Ottoman government's declaration of martial law in the area.|$|E

25|$|At that time, {{the city}} of Turin had a {{population}} of 117,000 inhabitants. It reflected the effects of industrialization and urbanization: numerous poor families lived in the slums of the city, having come from the countryside {{in search of a}} better life. In visiting the prisons, Don Bosco was disturbed to see so many boys from 12 to 18 years of age. He was determined to find a means to prevent them ending up here. Because of population growth and migration to the city, Bosco found the traditional methods of parish ministry inefficient. He decided it was necessary to <b>try</b> <b>another</b> form of apostolate, and he began to meet the boys where they worked and gathered in shops and market places. They were pavers, stone-cutters, masons, plasterers who came from far away places, he recalled in his brief Memoires.|$|E
25|$|Operation Phiboonpol {{had ended}} in an indecisive standoff, despite heavy Communist casualties. Military Region 4's (MR 4) Commanding Officer General Phasouk Somly was {{hesitant}} to <b>try</b> <b>another</b> attack {{because of the}} poor fighting qualities of his troops. However, on 1 July 1971, King Sisavang Vatthana paid a royal visit to Pakse and demanded another offensive. Thus it was that Pakse Unit of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) planned an offensive into communist territory on the eastern Bolovens Plateau designed to block one of the supply arteries of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, Route 23. It would also retake two airstrips while occupying the Bolovens Plateau. The plan was for a two phase operation involving not just troops from Pakse's (MR 4), but also from adjoining Military Region 3 (MR 3). As projected, the Royalist force of 11 battalions numbered 4,000 strong; the opposing three Communist battalions could muster barely 1,100 troops. In phase one, MR 3's guerrillas would be airlifted to capture the Pakse 47 airfield southwest of Salavan at UTM coordinates XC5237. Phase two would be a squeeze play; a mobile force would be airlifted to a position northwest of Paksong, while a column probed eastward toward it along Route 23. The Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF) would supply close air support {{at the rate of}} two AC-47 and 35 T-28 sorties daily. Belatedly, the planners realized that RLAF support would be insufficient. Three days before the operation's scheduled start, they requested and received a commitment for 12 daily sorties of tactical air for the next month. The U.S. Air Force (USAF) would fly interdiction strikes on the communist lines of communication with fighter-bombers by day and gunships by night. However, USAF support would not be on a dedicated basis; instead it would be diverted as needed. Logistical air support would come from USAF helicopters, RLAF transports, and Air America under contract. Not taken into account {{was the fact that the}} Royalist columns were not mutually supportive. General Minh, commander of the PAVN battalions, would use this flaw to defeat the Royalists in detail by using his interior lines of communication.|$|E

500|$|Despite these failures, Joseph Meyers, Avon's owner, {{decided to}} <b>try</b> <b>another</b> pulp {{magazine}} {{the following year}} when his printer, J.W. Clements offered Meyers a low price for printing a pulp magazine. [...] Donald A. Wollheim, Avon's executive editor, titled the new magazine 10 Story Fantasy, although it actually contained thirteen stories. [...] The layout bore a strong resemblance to that of Out of This World Adventures: both magazines had unusually elaborate artwork for the table of contents, and in both magazines the first letter of each story was decorated with black and white art.

500|$|The film {{is presumed}} lost as no known {{surviving}} {{copies of the}} film exist. A synopsis of the film was published in The Moving Picture World. It states: [...] "Glade and Sears are next door neighbors and old friends. Glade has a daughter, while Sears has a son. The young people have never met, being away at school while the old folks have been cementing their friendship. As the two men own adjoining places, {{they believe that the}} best thing for the younger people to do is to get married. So they try to bring this about. Gladys Glade and Charlie Sears meet on the train while they are returning home and start a flirtation. Perhaps they would have married in the end, if the old folks hadn't 'butted in.' As it is, they lose all interest in each other. Then the fathers <b>try</b> <b>another</b> tack. They decide to be bitter enemies in public, hoping the opposition will bring the children together. The new plan works like a charm, and Gladys and Charlie, realizing their parents' shortcomings, decide to elope. They do so, much to the satisfaction of Glade and Sears." ...|$|E

[...] Roosevelt argued that such apparently haphazard methodology was necessary. [...] "The country needs and, unless I mistake its temper, the country demands bold, persistent experimentation," [...] he wrote. [...] "It is common sense to take a method and try it; if it fails, admit it frankly and <b>try</b> <b>another.</b> But above all, try something." ...|$|E
