5|$|Benton, Bauer and {{the boys}} are spotted by Iké's helicopter. While they flee into the forest, Benton steps on a land mine. With little time to disarm it, Benton urges Bauer to leave, so he can buy time. When he is {{surrounded}} by Iké and his men, Benton takes his foot off <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> <b>and</b> detonates the mine, killing himself and the rebels, though Iké survives. Bauer and the children continue to the capital, where he defeats another rebel ambush. At {{the gates of the}} embassy, Trammel denies the children entry and blackmails Bauer into surrendering for the children's safety. He reluctantly accepts, thus sacrificing his freedom. While Taylor is inaugurated President, Bauer and the children evacuate, leaving chaotic Sangala behind.|$|E
5|$|The P90 was {{designed}} to have a length no greater than a man's shoulder width, {{to allow it to}} be easily carried and maneuvered in tight spaces, such as the inside of an armored vehicle. To achieve this, the weapon's design uses the unconventional bullpup configuration, in which the action and magazine are located behind <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> <b>and</b> alongside the shooter's face so that there is no wasted space in the stock. The P90's dimensions are minimized by its unique horizontally mounted feeding system, wherein the box magazine sits parallel to the barrel on top of the weapon's frame. The weapon overall has an extremely compact profile—it is the most compact fixed-stock submachine gun to be made. The standard version of the weapon has an overall length of 500mm (19.7in), a height of 210mm (8.3in), and a width of 55mm (2.2in).|$|E
5|$|To {{initiate}} {{firing the}} weapon the trigger mechanism, which was essentially just a large spring, {{had to be}} cocked, and to do this was a difficult and awkward process. The user had to first place the PIAT on its butt, then place two feet on the shoulder padding and turn the weapon to unlock the body and simultaneously lock the firing pin to the butt; the user would then have to bend over and pull {{the body of the}} weapon upwards, thereby pulling the spring back until it attached to <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> <b>and</b> cocking the weapon. Once this was achieved, the body was then lowered and turned to reattach it {{to the rest of the}} weapon, and the PIAT could then be fired. Users of a small stature often found the cocking sequence challenging, as they did not have the sufficient height required to pull the body up far enough to cock the weapon; it was also difficult to do when lying in a prone position, as was often the case when using the weapon in action.|$|E

5|$|With {{the help}} of some miners, John and Kanyenke bring down large rock bridges to stop the Russians' large cannons from getting through. John then sends Kanyenke and the {{remainder}} of his mercenaries back east as he plants explosives to cause an avalanche and bury the Russians in the mountains. In the end, as John is setting up the dynamite, Warwick and several Boneguard approach him. Warwick attempts to kill John but John uses a barrel of gunpowder as a shield (knowing that Warwick won't risk detonating it by shooting at him), jumps to <b>the</b> <b>trigger,</b> <b>and</b> pushes it, detonating the mountainside; killing himself, the soldiers, and Warwick; and causing an avalanche. The avalanche buries the Russians and sets the Circle of Ossus back so far that they cause no problems for many years.|$|E
25|$|As above, {{a double}} set trigger accomplishes the same thing, but uses two {{triggers}}: one sets <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> <b>and</b> the other fires the weapon.

25|$|Firearms use {{triggers}} {{to initiate}} the firing of a cartridge in the firing chamber of the weapon. This is accomplished by actuating a striking device {{through a combination of}} spring and kinetic energy operating through a firing pin to strike and ignite the primer. There are two primary types of striking mechanisms, hammers and strikers. Hammers are spring-tensioned masses of metal that pivot on a pin when released and strike a firing pin to discharge a cartridge. Strikers are, essentially, spring-loaded firing pins that travel on an axis in-line with the cartridge eliminating the need for a separate hammer. The connection between <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> <b>and</b> the hammer is generally referred to as the sear surface. Variable mechanisms will have this surface directly on <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> <b>and</b> hammer or have separate sears or other connecting parts.|$|E

A spontaneous breath may be assisted or unassisted. A mandatory breath is a breath for which the machine triggers and/or cycles the breath. A mandatory breath can occur during a spontaneous breath (e.g., High Frequency Jet Ventilation). A mandatory breath is, by definition, assisted.|$|E
25|$|A tragedy {{occurred}} {{early in}} Carlos Salinas's life. On 18 December 1951, {{when he was}} three years old, he, his older brother Raúl, then five, and an eight-year-old friend were playing and the Salinas family's twelve-year-old maid, Manuela, was shot. It was never determined which of the three boys pulled <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> <b>and</b> the incident was declared an accident; it was given newspaper coverage in Excélsior at the time. A judge blamed the Salinas parents for leaving a loaded weapon accessible to their small children. The Salinas family {{did not know the}} last name of their 12-year-old maid Manuela—only that she came from San Pedro Atzcapotzaltongo—and it is unknown whether her family ever claimed her body. They were also exonerated with the assistance of Gilberto Bolaños Cacho, maternal uncle of legendary Mexican comedian Chespirito. He has not commented publicly on this tragic early childhood incident.|$|E
25|$|The Glock's frame, {{magazine}} body, {{and several}} other components are made from a high-strength nylon-based polymer invented by Gaston Glock, called Polymer 2. This plastic was specially formulated to provide increased durability and is more resilient than carbon steel and most steel alloys. Polymer 2 is resistant to shock, caustic liquids, and temperature extremes where traditional steel/alloy frames would warp and become brittle. The injection-molded frame contains four hardened steel guide rails for the slide: two {{at the rear of}} the frame, and the remaining pair above and in front of the trigger guard. The trigger guard itself is squared off at the front and checkered. The grip has an angle of 109° and a nonslip, stippled surface on the sides and both the front and rear straps. The frame houses the locking block, which is an investment casting that engages a 45° camming surface on the barrel's lower camming lug. It is retained in the frame by a steel axis pin that holds <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> <b>and</b> slide catch. The trigger housing is held to the frame by means of a polymer pin. A spring-loaded sheet-metal pressing serves as the slide catch, which is secured from unintentional manipulation by a raised guard molded into the frame.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} clarify process for {{supplying}} initial electrons, mechanism of <b>the</b> synchronization <b>and</b> <b>triggering</b> of positive surface streamer discharge in air, experiments {{were carried out}} by use of two types of shading plates to limit {{the path of the}} discharge light and two types of insulator with two parallel connected high voltage (H. V.) electrodes. Discharge light from a triple junction under the H. V. electrode to another triple junction is not indispensable for <b>the</b> <b>triggering</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> synchronizing. In case of parallel cylindrical insulator, discharge light from a side wall of the cylinder to another side wall is not effective but the light around the top of the cylinder to the opposite top area is effective. Furthermore, irradiation to the area above the top of the cylinder is possibly effective. This is still in the stage of hypothesis but it can be considered that gas phase can produce initial electrons effective for <b>the</b> <b>triggering</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> synchronizing of the positive surface streamer discharge. 1...|$|R

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>triggering</b> <b>and</b> {{stability}} of continuous explosions {{have been the}} critical argument for a rootless eruption. For rootless eruptions in a littoral area, {{the collapse of a}} lava delta and the subsequent inflow of lava into water-bearing coastal sediments triggers lava–water interaction (Mattox and Mangan 1997). For an inland setting, Reynolds et al. (2015) showed a possible stabilizing mechanism of a conduit that can produce continuous rootless eruption. The spatter lining on the inner wall may maintain the conduit during the explosions. There are no integrated explanations of <b>the</b> <b>triggering</b> <b>and</b> continuous maintenance of eruptions that form rootless cones. Rootless eruptions can be hazardous. On March 16, 2017, the explosive interaction of lava and snow on the flank of Mt. Etna injured 10 people, with ejected products ranging from ash to decimeter-sized bombs (Todesco 2017; Andronico et al. 2018). A sudden explosion at the ocean entry of Kilauea, Hawaii, on July 16, 2018, damaged a tour boat, and 23 people were burned by a lava bomb that had penetrated the roof (U.S. Geological Survey 2018; DLNR 2018). In this background, understanding <b>the</b> <b>triggering</b> <b>and</b> {{stability of}} continuous explosions in a rootless eruption would contribute to regional disaster prevention around volcanic areas. Furthermore, such an understanding would apply to not only rootless eruptions but also other external water-related volcanic eruptions.|$|R
