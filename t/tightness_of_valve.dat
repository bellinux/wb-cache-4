40|$|For a Lab-on-Chip {{platform}} for Point-of-Care use, integrated controlling of liquid flow at an affordable price is essential. Besides micro pumps, also valves {{may be required}} e. g. to form closed reaction chambers or to direct the flow of a liquid. Microfluidic valves based on electrochemical gas generation inside a hydrogel have therefore been fabricated. The valves are suitable for mass fabrication {{and are able to}} gas-tightly seal off a microfluidic channel. As the valve can be considered as tightly closed now, the resistance <b>of</b> the <b>valve</b> towards the applied pressure has to be evaluated. The pump pressure was therefore stepwise increased. After each step, the <b>tightness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>valve</b> was tested by closing the on/off valve. In all cases, the pressure kept stable {{at the level of the}} pressure applied by the pump before. The valves can withstand a pressure of more than 50 mbar. Above this value, the valves still can be used to dramatically increase the flow resistance and thus the pressure drop of a channel, which is sufficient for flow direction in microfluidic systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Diaphragm {{gas meter}} is a {{specialized}} flow meter that measures {{the volume of}} fuel gas such as natural gas and coal gas. Valve bonnet and valve seat are the key parts of diaphragm gas meter, which compose the main factors of its metering error. The widely detecting ways are direct observational method and pneumatic pressure method. Direct observational method only realizes the qualitative detection with lacking science. Pneumatic pressure method can realize the quantitative detection, but with low accuracy and bad reliability. In order to evaluate the gas <b>tightness</b> <b>of</b> diaphragm gas meter valve accurately, surface texture method was adopted. Firstly, the surface roughness mathematical model <b>of</b> <b>valve</b> working face was established. A fast Gaussian filtering convolution algorithm was proposed based on the symmetry of Gaussian density function. Secondly, the working face <b>of</b> gas <b>valve</b> on the high-precision air floating stage was scanned by the chromatic confocal sensor. And the roughness profile <b>of</b> <b>valve</b> working face was got through the fast Gaussian filter when the cut-off wavelength was 0. 8 mm. Then the roughness parameters could be calculated with MATLAB by setting the sampling length and evaluation length. The results show that surface roughness has a difference of over 1 µm between the qualified and unqualified valve. Besides, {{there is a little}} deviation of below 9 % between the experimental value and the stylus profilometer measuring value, which has no influence on the judging result of qualified or unqualified about the measured workpiece. The gas <b>tightness</b> performance <b>of</b> gas <b>valve</b> can be judged by measuring surface roughness of its working face, which can provide a scientific basis for evaluating the quality of diaphragm gas meter valve in a quantitative way. 1...|$|R

40|$|Navigation locks {{are used}} to {{transport}} vessels between waterways with different water levels. In the nearby future many navigation locks will be renovated or replaced. During {{the design of a}} new lock still some unknown factors are encountered. One of these factors is the vibration <b>of</b> the <b>valve.</b> The <b>valve</b> is part <b>of</b> the filling and emptying system that is responsible for the levelling of the water in the lock chamber. The most used valve type is a vertical-lift valve. During the filling and emptying of the lock, water flows with high velocity underneath the <b>valve.</b> The flow <b>of</b> water can cause vibrations. These vibrations are called flow-induced vibrations and could lead to failure <b>of</b> the <b>valve</b> system. Possible failures are for example that the operating machinery {{will not be able to}} open the valve or that the valve will hit other elements due to the vibrations. As a consequence the lock gate complex cannot meet its requirements anymore. Several types of flow-induced vibrations can be distinguished. This distinction is based on the cause of the vibration. This research only focussed on vibrations due to turbulence and instability of the flow. The above-mentioned types can be experienced in two directions. The two directions are in-flow (horizontal in the direction of the flow) and cross-flow (perpendicular to the direction of the flow). A valve is more likely to vibrate in a vertical direction than a horizontal direction, because the majority <b>of</b> the <b>valves</b> is positioned in a niche of a gate or culvert. Currently not much information regarding the flow-induced vibrations due to turbulence or instability of the water flow is available and the information that is available is often out dated. The shape could have an effect on the flow-induced vibrations. This seal has to ensure the water <b>tightness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>valve.</b> No research has been done on the effects of the seal shapes, which are used nowadays, on the dynamic behaviour. Therefore, the information of the effect of seal shapes as used in practice is missing. In the current situation a guideline involving the natural frequency <b>of</b> the <b>valve</b> system is used. This guideline states that the natural frequency <b>of</b> the <b>valve</b> has to be larger than three times the excitation frequency. Therefore, the main research question of this research is: What is the effect of the shape of the lower edge seal on the vertical flow-induced vibrations <b>of</b> a <b>valve</b> in a filling and emptying culvert? The vibration phenomena have been investigated by means of a physical model. A simplified scale model <b>of</b> the <b>valve</b> is constructed and tested in a current flume under varying conditions. The varying parameters during these tests are the flow velocity underneath the <b>valve,</b> the stiffness <b>of</b> the vertical suspension, the gate opening underneath the valve and the shape of the lower edge seal. Four different seal shapes have been tested. The tests have been executed under steady state conditions. In addition to the steady state tests, free-decay tests (to determine the natural frequency and damping) and tests to determine the contraction have been executed. The physical tests showed that the shape did have an effect on the presence of the flow-induced vibrations and on the amplitude of the vibrations. However some other parameters influenced the vibrations. For example the relative gate opening and the Reynolds number. The study has proven the presence of the flow-induced vibrations. However, the executed physical model test should be optimized to get a more accurate view on the different phenomena. Also should the effect of certain parameters (Reynolds number, water levels) be further investigated. Civil Engineering and GeosciencesHydraulic Engineerin...|$|R
