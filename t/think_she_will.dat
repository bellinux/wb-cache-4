500|$|The Allied {{delegation}} initially thought Article 231 to be a mundane {{addition to}} the treaty intended to limit German liability with regard to reparations, and were surprised at the vehemence of the German protests. Georges Clemenceau rebuffed Brockdorff-Rantzau's allegations, arguing that [...] "the legal interpretation [...] was the correct one" [...] and {{not a matter of}} political question. Lloyd George commented that [...] "the English public, like the French public, thinks the Germans must above all acknowledge their obligation to compensate us for all the consequences of their aggression. When this is done we come to the question of Germany's capacity to pay; we all <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>will</b> be unable to pay more than this document requires of her." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{second act}} takes place a week later, when the movie's cast are {{attending}} a decadent party at Gloria's house. Wally and Chicky have conspired {{to use the}} phony engagement of Betty and Wally to win Zeffie's approval of the real relationship between Betty and Chicky. They <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>will</b> find Wally so unacceptable that Chicky will seem good in comparison. Meanwhile, Gloria also wants to prove Wally is an unfit match for Betty, by seducing him {{to prove that he}} is unfaithful. She lures Wally to her bedroom suite on the pretense of renewing their relationship, without intending to follow through. She plans to tease him until Zeffie finds them there, but he is prepared for her plan and will not accept any delay; the act ends with him telling her that she must fulfill her [...] "marriage debt" [...] to him.|$|E
500|$|Lady Charlotte Finch's {{career as}} royal governess began in August 1762, {{when she was}} {{appointed}} {{a day after the}} birth of George, Prince of Wales, the eldest son and heir of King George III and Queen Charlotte. Walpole called the decision [...] "a choice so universally approved that I do not <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>will</b> be abused even in the North Briton". Finch's biographer, Jill Shefrin, writes that the governess was noted for the skill she devoted to the raising of her own children, while Christopher Hibbert suggests that her educated background made her [...] "well-suited" [...] to the position. Lady Charlotte held the role of royal governess for over 30 years, and oversaw 14 of the king and queen's 15 children. She presided over the royal nursery, overseeing the staff members designated for each child; the staff included sub-governesses, teachers, personal attendants, and assistant governesses. She oversaw the princes until they became old enough to live in their own households, while the six princesses remained under her supervision until they turned 21.|$|E

2500|$|In mid-July, it was {{announced}} that Douglas had once again left Chow's Gymnastics & Dance Institute. [...] She remained {{in the market for a}} new coach until the beginning of August, when news broke that Douglas would train under Kittia Carpenter at Buckeye Gymnastics in Westerville, Ohio. [...] Nia Dennis, national team member, also trained at Buckeye at the time. [...] Carpenter announced that Douglas would not aim to return to competition at the 2014 national championships, as previously planned, but would instead train with a goal of returning in time for Worlds 2015. [...] The stated reasoning for Douglas's delay is that she wishes to return as strong as – or stronger than – when she left. [...] National Team Coordinator Marta Karolyi, who expressed satisfaction and some surprise with Douglas's physical condition at her first two national team training camps back (while she was once again working with Chow), commented on Douglas's planned comeback in Ohio, [...] "My wish is that she will be consistent in her training. And if that's what she will do, I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>will</b> be fine. But if she jumps up and down and left and right, it will be much harder." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sonya is {{an animal}} lover who has {{previously}} worked for Guide Dogs Victoria. She is good-hearted and relished {{her role as}} a trainer. A writer for Network Ten's Neighbours website described Sonya has having a shady past and wanting to set up a new life for herself in Erinsborough. Sonya used to have alcohol, drug and gambling addictions, but she has worked hard to overcome them. Morey told a reporter from Channel 5 that she is similar to Sonya morally and ethically, plus they both want the best for the people they love. However, Sonya occasionally goes about things in a way in which Morey said she did not understand. The actress also struggled to understand the place of darkness that Sonya has been in too. When asked if her character could ever escape her past, Morey replied [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>will</b> every truly escape her past because ultimately I don't think she should. If she doesn't have it there as a reminder and a good motivator to help her stay on track." [...] Morey revealed she would like to see Sonya reach her potential as a mother in the future.|$|E
2500|$|In the show's second series, Ullman portrays current Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon as {{megalomaniac}} who {{is after}} more than just Scottish Independence. Westminster's youngest MP, Mhairi Black assists Sturgeon in the series opener by torturing a captive JK Rowling. On Sturgeon, Ullman says: [...] "I like her a lot and respect her steeliness. [...] I would love her to meet [...] and play golf with him and whup his ass. [...] Jeremy Dyson imagined her as a Bond villain — we filmed for two days in Chislehurst Caves, it was freezing and I was wearing pink, four-inch high heels. But I felt very powerful, and the crew were very much under my command. I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>will</b> like it — {{she seems to have}} a good sense of humour." [...] The portrayal was lauded by viewers and critics alike as well as angering some SNP supporters. Singer Toyah Willcox implored Sturgeon to take the sketch in the right spirit. Ullman had impersonated Willcox back in the early 1980s. Sturgeon took to Twitter to comment on the impersonation: [...] "Great to see my fav Scottish designers @TottyRocksLtd featuring on @TraceyUllmanTV last night)" [...] Upon seeing her portrayal, Mhairi Black (impersonated by actress Olivia Morgan) was quoted as saying [...] "It was all right. It was quite a bizarre scenario. But I thought it was quite clever and quite witty." [...] In an interview for the Metro newspaper during the 2017 United Kingdom general election, Nicola Sturgeon was asked about Ullman's impersonation of her. [...] "I've not seen all of them but I had to watch some because I've heard so much about it. I thought it was really funny." [...] When asked if she should her in all the [...] "Brexit drama", Sturgeon responded: [...] "I definitely think she should! She's got the outfit and everything!" ...|$|E
