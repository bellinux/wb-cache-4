5|$|C. c. coronoides, the {{nominate}} or eastern subspecies, {{is found}} across most of eastern Australia. Its range is also {{highly correlated with}} the presence of sheep. This is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> of the frequency of dead animals, which can be an important source of food. Ornithologist Ian Rowley held that the eastern subspecies was expanding eastwards before European colonisation, and that this suggested it was of younger origin than the western subspecies, which appears static. The advent of agriculture facilitated further spread.|$|E
5|$|Just before migration, the ruff {{increases}} {{its body}} mass {{at a rate}} of about 1% a day, much slower than the bar-tailed godwits breeding in Alaska, which fatten at four times that rate. This is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> the godwit cannot use refuelling areas to feed on its trans-Pacific flight, whereas the ruff is able to make regular stops and take in food during overland migration. For the same reason, the ruff does not physiologically shrink its digestive organs to reduce bodyweight before migrating, unlike the godwit.|$|E

5|$|No tornado watches or {{warnings}} {{were issued}} {{before the storm}} struck. This was later determined <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> of missing atmospheric sounding data, {{as well as an}} incorrect assessment of the height of the tropopause, which led to an underestimation of the strength of the thunderstorm which produced the tornado. Although a severe thunderstorm warning was issued at 2:57 pm, very few people received the warnings in time.|$|E
5|$|Observations {{have failed}} to note signs of {{accretion}} leading up to Type Ia supernovae, and this is now thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> the star is first loaded up to above the Chandrasekhar limit while also being spun up to a very high rate by the same process. Once the accretion stops the star gradually slows until the spin is no longer enough to prevent the explosion.|$|E
5|$|Tang dynasty (618–907) {{emperors}} gave princesses {{in marriage}} to {{rulers of the}} Uyghur Khaganate to consolidate the special trade and military relationship that developed after the Khaganate supported the Chinese during the An Lushan Rebellion. At least three Tang imperial princesses {{are known to have}} married khagans between 758 and 821. These unions temporarily stopped in 788, which is believed in part <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> stability within the Chinese empire meant that they were politically unnecessary; however, threats from Tibet in the west, and a renewed need for Uyghur support, precipitated the marriage of Princess Taihe to Bilge Khagan.|$|E

5|$|Unlike other whales (and {{most other}} mammals), the females {{are larger than}} the males. Sexual {{dimorphism}} is usually reversed, with the males being larger, but the females of all baleen whales are usually five percent larger than males. Sexual dimorphism is also displayed through whale song, notably in humpback whales where the males of the species sing elaborate songs. Male right whales have bigger callosities than female right whales. The males are generally more scarred than females which is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> of aggression during mating season.|$|E
5|$|The {{signature}} of the military-appointed civilian Chief of State Phan Khắc Sửu was required to pass the ruling, but Sửu referred the matter to the High National Council (HNC), a junta-appointed civilian advisory body, to get their opinion. The HNC turned down the request. This was speculated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> many HNC members were old, and did not appreciate the generals' negativity towards seniors. On 19 December, the generals dissolved the HNC. The operation was commanded by Thi — who had traveled into Saigon from I Corps — and Kỳ. The national police, which was under the control and command of the military, moved through the streets before dawn, arresting five HNC members and other politicians and student leaders they deemed to be an obstacle to military rule. Minh and the other aging generals were arrested and flown to Pleiku, a Central Highlands town in a Montagnard area and forcibly retired, while other officers were simply imprisoned in the capital. The junta's forces also arrested around 100 members of the National Salvation Council (NSC) of the anti-war Lê Khắc Quyến party. The NSC was a new political party active in the I Corps region that opposed {{the expansion of the}} war and was aligned with Thi and the Buddhist activist monk Thích Trí Quang. As Thi was active in the purge, it was believed that the Quyen had fallen out with Thi.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of the local stores were never rebuilt because, even though store owners had great desire to rebuild, they had trouble getting loans; myths about the area arose discouraging investment {{in the area and}} preventing growth of employment.

Similarly, this only occurred if the woman was partnered with a desirable mate. This is suggested <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> other females, especially those who are ovulating, {{are less likely to}} desire men that have limited resources.|$|E

25|$|In Finland, the Apollo {{was one of}} {{the first}} species of insects {{declared}} endangered. The Apollo population in Finland and Sweden decreased drastically during the 1950s. The reason for this is not known, but it is commonly thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> of a disease. In Sweden, it is now restricted to areas that have limestone in the ground, suggesting that the decrease could hypothetically be related to acid rain.|$|E
25|$|The Bay {{is mostly}} {{known for its}} seafood production, {{especially}} blue crabs, clams and oysters. In {{the middle of the}} 20th century, the Bay supported 9,000 full-time watermen, according to one account. Today, the body of water is less productive than it used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> of runoff from urban areas (mostly on the Western Shore) and farms (especially on the Eastern Shore and in the Susquehanna River watershed), over-harvesting, and invasion of foreign species.|$|E
25|$|McVitie married Marie Marney in Surrey in 1950. He fathered one son who {{was named}} Tony Mcvitie.

With Brett Lee bowling well and picking up the early wicket of Marcus Trescothick for a duck, England were well behind on the run rate from the start.|$|E
25|$|Saint Cloud, {{where she}} was less watched and {{confined}} than in Paris (where her jailers followed her every step, even in her bedroom). Mirabeau retained a close connection with the queen, and drew up many state papers for her. In return, the king used money from Austria to pay his debts secretly {{and give him a}} monthly subsidy of six thousand francs, with promises of a million or more. Some historians argue Mirabeau was not the traitor that many believed him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> he continued to uphold his political beliefs and tried to make possible a bridge between the king and the revolutionaries.|$|E
25|$|In 2007 the Edinburgh DVLA office {{exceptionally}} issued TN07 prefixed registrations {{for some}} vehicles, {{instead of the}} expected 'SN07'. This was stated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> of potential offence caused by interpreting SN07 as 'snot'. This is the first known use of the 'T' code as the first letter, as it was not allocated to a region in the 2001 system. Also, TF07, TH07 and TJ07 registrations have been issued in Glasgow, most probably because the SA07–SJ07 allocations were exhausted. Similarly, along with TN07, TK07 has also been issued by Edinburgh, probably for the same oversubscription reason as in Glasgow. It has also been observed that the TP07 mark has also been issued.|$|E
50|$|One way {{in which}} one would attempt to shift {{the burden of proof}} is by {{committing}} a logical fallacy known as the argument from ignorance.
