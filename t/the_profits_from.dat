5|$|Although the Act of 1975 had {{specified}} that {{a portion of}} <b>the</b> <b>profits</b> <b>from</b> land sales be used to maintain the remaining cemetery, little restoration work was done and the cemetery continued to revert to wilderness. With the new owners of the land interested only in redeveloping {{those parts of the}} cemetery not currently in use, the cemetery itself sank further into neglect.|$|E
30|$|Our surveys {{indicated}} that <b>the</b> <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> potatoes is 18, 000  yuan/ha, and <b>the</b> <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> scallions is 67, 500  yuan/ha. A farmer wanting {{to adopt the}} conversion plan would incur 14, 400  yuan in opportunity costs according to the designed rule described in Farmers’ Intention. However, <b>the</b> <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> scallions is 27, 000  yuan. Therefore, even if the opportunity cost was incurred before the maturation of the scallions, the farmer would still earn 12, 600  yuan. This reasoning explains why the conversion cost is not considered in the farmer household decision making model.|$|R

Mitsubishi could build the car profitably even in small numbers {{due to its}} high 97% level of local Australian content and amortised tooling. However, the car was still badged as the Chrysler Valiant, not as a Mitsubishi. <b>The</b> <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sale of one Valiant was equal to <b>the</b> <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> 3 Mitsubishi Sigmas- {{by this time the}} Company's main seller.|$|R

5|$|The {{album was}} {{created as a}} ploy by Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker, to self-release an Elvis Presley album through his own label, Boxcar Records.

However, KKR was still burdened by the performance of the RJR investment and repeated obituaries in the media. KKR was required by its investors to reduce the fees it charged and to calculate its carried interest based on the total profit of the fund (i.e., offsetting losses from failed deals against <b>the</b> <b>profits</b> <b>from</b> successful deals).|$|E
5|$|Superfinalen ("The Super Final") is {{a former}} Norwegian {{association}} football competition contested between the previous season's champions of the Norwegian Premier League and the Norwegian Football Cup.

The competition was held twice, in 2009 and 2010. The first competition saw Stabæk, reigning league winners, beat Vålerenga 3–1. The following year, league winners Rosenborg beat cup winners Aalesund 3–1. The competition was then deemed commercially unprofitable and abandoned.|$|E

Pratt had also prepared an apparent sequel to the primers, the Deseret Phonetic Speller. After the sales failure, however, none of these books were ever published and were thought lost until being rediscovered in a storage area of the LDS Church Archives in Salt Lake City in May 1967.|$|E
5|$|A {{major source}} of income was the export of wool. However, the fourteenth century saw a change in fortunes: the Black Death, a {{worsening}} economic climate and poor administration left the abbey (like many others of its order) with sharply declining numbers of monks and saddled with major debt. The internal discipline and morals of the community declined too: in 1400–01 it was reported to the government that the abbot of Cleeve and three other monks were leading a group of 200 bandits and attacking travellers in the region. However, things improved {{in the fifteenth century}} and despite the vast expense caused by the extravagant building projects of the last abbots, better management, access to new resources (for instance from <b>the</b> <b>profits</b> <b>from</b> the right to hold markets granted by the crown) and a general improvement in the circumstances facing the house meant that just prior to the dissolution Cleeve was enjoying an Indian Summer of comfortable stability.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Indonesia in 1965, Sjumandjaja {{worked at the}} Ministry of Information; from 1966 to 1968 he {{was the head of}} the film directorate and succeeded in passing a bill which used <b>the</b> <b>profits</b> <b>from</b> film imports to fund local productions. He later continued directing and screenwriting while taking a five-year term as the head of the Jakarta Art Bureau. His 1971 feature film debut, Lewat Tengah Malam (Past Midnight), produced by Allied Film Indonesia, brought him under close supervision by the Suharto-led government for its social critique, while Pengantin Remadja (Teenage Newlyweds), which he wrote, won an award at the 1971 Asian Film Festival. This was followed by Flambojan (Flamboyant; 1972).|$|E

5|$|Carucage was {{an attempt}} to secure new sources of revenue to {{supplement}} existing sources of income. It was also intended to increase the royal revenues in the face of new demands placed upon them. Although derived from the older geld, carucage was an experiment in revenue collection, but it was only levied for specific purposes, rather than as a general tax regularly assessed. A novel feature was the consultation with the barons and other leading members of the ruling classes. Despite its intermittent use during the reigns of Richard I, John, and the early years of Henry III, the main source of royal income at that time remained scutage, feudal dues such as feudal reliefs or feudal aids, and royal rights such as <b>the</b> <b>profits</b> <b>from</b> the justice system.|$|E

Burnell was also responsible for the decision to force the Court of Chancery to settle in London, rather than following the king and his court around the country.

5|$|In March 1997, NSB {{announced}} that they had plans to privatize {{the operations of the}} line from 1998. The responsibility for setting the schedule, selling tickets and marketing was transferred to Flåm Utvikling, a newly established company that NSB owned 49 percent of, and Aurland Ressursutvikling 51 percent. The latter was owned by Aurland Municipality, the Industrial Development Corporation of Norway and Aurland Sparebank, a local bank. Flåm Utvikling also took over responsibility for other tourism-related activities in Flåm, such as port facilities. NSB would still operate the trains, and Flåm Utvikling would pay NSB the cost of running the trains, but keep <b>the</b> <b>profits</b> <b>from</b> the ticket sales. The Norwegian National Rail Administration, which had been established in 1996 and had taken over the responsibility for infrastructure, retained ownership of the line itself. Flåm Utvikling also started building a cruise ship terminal at Flåm, so tourists could walk ashore and directly to the trains.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days, Chinese Foochow {{settlers}} in Sibu tried {{to convert the}} town into a rice cultivation centre. However, this vision did not materialise because the soil was not suitable for rice cultivation. In August 1909, Charles Brooke agreed to grant land titles to Sibu Chinese farmers and encouraged them to cultivate rubber plantations. The rise of rubber prices from 1909 to 1911 had encouraged another 2,000 Foochow settles to come to Sibu. The demand for rubber rose again during Korean War between 1950 and 1953 and has benefited Sibu rubber plantations. Local farmers later used <b>the</b> <b>profits</b> <b>from</b> rubber plantations into setting up shops at Sungai Merah and Durin bazaars and involve in more profitable timber industry. During the Sarawak Communist Insurgency in the 1970s, rural farmers had to abandon their rubber plantations because of martial law declared by the state government which forbade them for helping the communists operating in the jungles.|$|E

There {{were a number of}} rumours: that she had died in the 1918 flu pandemic, that she had travelled to New York to undergo a sex-change, or that she had always been a draft dodging man, though none provided any credible evidence.

5|$|The UERL {{struggled}} financially in {{the first}} years after the opening of its lines and narrowly avoided bankruptcy in 1908 by restructuring its debt. A policy of expansion by acquisition was followed before World War I, so that the company came to operate the majority of the underground railway lines in and around London. It also controlled large bus and tram fleets, <b>the</b> <b>profits</b> <b>from</b> which subsidised the financially weaker railways. After the war, railway extensions took the UERL's services out into suburban areas to stimulate additional passenger numbers, so that, by the early 1930s, the company's lines stretched beyond the County of London and served destinations in Middlesex, Essex, Hertfordshire and Surrey.|$|E
