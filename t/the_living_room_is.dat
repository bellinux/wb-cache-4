The friendship between the two seems to evolve when Paul Massigny, a French politician and Davenne's former best friend dies. The film suggests that Massigny once betrayed Davenne but does not say what constituted the betrayal.

25|$|The formal {{living room}} ceiling was hand painted and stenciled by Bryan Albert Painting Studio LLC located in Wauwatosa, WI. An Arts & Crafts-style {{chandelier}} {{was added to}} the room when electricity was installed in 1912. The room's hardwood floor was installed diagonally which was expensive at the time. An original Eastlake-style fireplace was brought out of storage during the 1974 reconstruction and two original ceramic dogs were placed on top. Next to <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> the master bedroom which features a closet which were rare at the time since they were taxed as an additional room.|$|E

30|$|When <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> did not require cooling but the FCU was being operated {{due to the}} {{requirements}} of other rooms, the air temperature of <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> 0.5  K lower than the set value, as shown in segment C of Fig.  7, and it <b>was</b> found that <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> air temperature could reach a maximum of 2.6  K lower than the set value. Because the door of the <b>room</b> where dehumidification <b>was</b> required was closed, the humidity could not be satisfied in this <b>room,</b> so dehumidification <b>was</b> still required, and <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> consequently over-cooled. Therefore, if a door is closed because of sleeping, leading to the airflow being limited, the representative room not requiring cooling might become over-cooled, while other rooms that need dehumidification might not be dehumidified; considerations of these conditions are necessary for system design.|$|R

The {{main focus}} {{of this study is}} examining the activities that <b>are</b> performed in <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> and interior design of <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> In <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> both private and public activities can <b>be</b> performed. Living <b>room</b> serves as a stage where dwellers reflect their identity to the outside world. In this study, the factors that affect the use and interior design of <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>are</b> defined. According to these factors, the group differences in the use and interior design of <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> has <b>been</b> examined. A field survey was conducted in “Angora Evleri” which is an upper income suburb in Ankara. Results indicated that the existence of the family room affected the type, number and frequency of activities that <b>were</b> performed in <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> <b>The</b> existence of the family room also affected the intentions for the interior design and the selected interior design elements in <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> Moreover, <b>the</b> selected interior design elements in <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> varied according to different groups of users. The results of the study indicated that the interior design of <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> related to gender, occupational status and time spent in the house, whereas the use of <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> seemed independent of these factors.
