5|$|Carucage was {{a medieval}} English land tax {{introduced}} by King Richard I in 1194, {{based on the}} size—variously calculated—of the estate owned by the taxpayer. It was a replacement for the danegeld, last imposed in 1162, which had become difficult to collect because of {{an increasing number of}} exemptions. Carucage was levied just six times: by Richard in 1194 and 1198; John, his brother and successor, in 1200; and John's son, Henry III, in 1217, 1220, and 1224, after which it was replaced by <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>income</b> and personal property.|$|E
5|$|Lands {{that were}} exempt from taxes were called manya and {{sometimes}} consisted of several villages. They were granted by local chieftains without {{any reference to}} the overlord, indicating a de-centralised economy. These lands, often given to heroes who perished {{in the line of}} duty were called bilavritti or kalnad. When such a grant was made for the maintenance of temples at the time of consecration, it was called Talavritti. Some types of <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>income</b> were kara or anthakara (internal taxes), utkota (gifts due to the king), hiranya (cash payments) and sulika (tolls and duties on imported items). Taxes were collected from those who held the right to cultivate land; even if the land was not actually cultivated.|$|E
5|$|Thatcher's {{economic}} policy {{was influenced by}} monetarist thinking and economists such as Milton Friedman and Alan Walters. Together with Chancellor of the Exchequer Geoffrey Howe, she lowered direct <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>income</b> and increased indirect taxes. She increased interest rates to slow {{the growth of the}} money supply and thereby lower inflation, introduced cash limits on public spending, and reduced expenditure on social services such as education and housing. Cuts to higher education resulted in her becoming the first Oxford-educated post-war Prime Minister without an honorary doctorate from Oxford University, after a 738–319 vote of the governing assembly and a student petition.|$|E

5|$|Taxes in the United States are levied at the federal, state, {{and local}} {{government}} levels. These include <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>income,</b> payroll, property, sales, imports, estates and gifts, as well as various fees. In 2010 taxes collected by federal, state and municipal governments amounted to 24.8% of GDP. During FY2012, the federal government collected approximately $2.45 trillion in tax revenue, up $147 billion or 6% versus FY2011 revenues of $2.30 trillion. Primary receipt categories included individual income taxes ($1,132B or 47%), Social Security/Social Insurance taxes ($845B or 35%), and corporate taxes ($242B or 10%). Based on CBO estimates, under 2013 tax law the top 1% will be paying the highest average tax rates since 1979, while other income groups will remain at historic lows.|$|E

25|$|The Court in Brushaber {{also noted}} that before Pollock, <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>income</b> from professions, trades, employments, or vocations were excises.

50|$|In a 5-4 {{decision}} on April 8, 1895, the Court {{ruled that the}} unapportioned <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>income</b> from land was unconstitutional. On May 20, 1895, the Court expanded its holding to rule that the unapportioned <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>income</b> from personal property (such as interest income and dividend income) was also unconstitutional. This decision partially overturned the ruling in Springer v. United States.|$|R
25|$|The Sixteenth Amendment {{removed the}} {{requirement}} for those income taxes deemed to be direct in substance (such as <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>income</b> from property) to be apportioned among the states according to population. Thus, {{the effect of the}} Pollock decision has indeed been overturned by the Sixteenth Amendment.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, {{with respect}} to <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>income</b> from property, the Pollock {{decision}} had disregarded form and considered substance alone.

25|$|Early in 1954, visiting Paris, Stuart {{first saw}} the Impressionist {{paintings}} at the Jeu de Paume museum. As when she first saw découpage, Stuart wanted to do it, too. The Sheekmans {{were on their way}} to Italy. At the time, American artists living abroad for at least eighteen months paid no <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>income</b> earned during the residency. Sheekman was now very successful. In the eight years since returning from New York, he had been on fourteen movies, mostly writing the screenplays. He wanted to try another play. For the next eighteen months, Stuart painted and Sheekman worked on his play.|$|E
25|$|In {{economic}} policy, Thatcher {{started out}} by increasing {{interest rates to}} drive down the money supply. She had a preference for indirect taxation over <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>income,</b> and value added tax (VAT) rose sharply to 15% {{with the result that}} inflation also rose. These moves hit businesses, especially in the manufacturing sector, and unemployment – which had stood at 1,500,000 {{by the time of the}} 1979 general election – was above 2,000,000 by the end of 1980. It continued to rise throughout 1981, passing the 2,500,000 mark during the summer of that year – although inflation was now down to 12% compared to 27% two years earlier. The economy was now in recession.|$|E
25|$|Congress has had {{the power}} to lay and collect an {{indirect}} <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>incomes</b> (such as wages and salaries) {{from the beginning of the}} American Government under the United States Constitution of 1787. The Sixteenth Amendment was to prevent the <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>income</b> from property, which Pollock had ruled was direct, from having to be apportioned. It did so by declaring that Congress could tax income from any source without apportionment.|$|R

In addition, many landlords or community associations also have restrictions on short term sublets. Hosts may be required to pay income <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>income</b> received via Airbnb and, in the United States, Airbnb sends tax forms to hosts that have earned over $20,000 in rents and received over 200 reservations via Airbnb in a calendar year.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally an aristocrat of {{the first}} rank did find himself in dire {{financial}} troubles. The severely impoverished Duke of Marlborough saved Blenheim Palace by marrying an heiress, tempted from the USA by the lure of an old title in return for vast riches. Not all were so fortunate or seemingly eligible. When 2nd Duke of Buckingham found himself bankrupt in 1848, he sold the contents of Stowe House, one of Britain's grandest houses. It {{proved to be a}} temporary solution; his heirs, the 3rd and final Duke of Buckingham and his heirs, the Earls Temple, inherited huge financial problems until finally in 1922 anything left that was moveable, both internal and external, was auctioned off and the house sold, narrowly escaping demolition. It was saved by being transformed into a school. Less fortunate was Clumber Park, the principal home of the Dukes of Newcastle. Selling the Hope diamond and other properties failed to solve the family problems, leaving no alternative but demolition of the huge, expensive-to-maintain house, which was razed to the ground in 1938, leaving the Duke without a ducal seat. Plans to rebuild a smaller house on the site were never executed. Other high-ranking members of the peerage were also forced to off-load minor estates and seats; the Duke of Northumberland retained Alnwick Castle, but sold Stanwick Park to be demolished, leaving him with four other country seats remaining. Likewise the Duke of Bedford kept Woburn Abbey, considerably reduced in size, after World War II, while selling other family estates and houses. Whatever the personal choices and reasons for the sales and demolitions, the underlying and unifying factor was almost always financial. The root of the problem began long before the 20th century with the gradual introduction and increase of <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>income</b> and further tax on inherited wealth, death duties.|$|E

2500|$|The quoted {{language}} {{regarding the}} [...] "complete and plenary power of income taxation possessed by Congress from the beginning" [...] is {{a reference to}} the power granted to Congress by the original text of Article I of the U.S. Constitution. The reference to [...] "being taken out of the category of indirect taxation to which it [...] belonged" [...] is {{a reference to the}} effect of the 1895 Court decision in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., where <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>income</b> from property (such as interest income and dividend income) – which, like <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>income</b> from labor, had always been considered indirect taxes (and therefore not subject to the apportionment rule) – were, beginning in 1895, treated as direct taxes. The Sixteenth Amendment overruled the effect of Pollock, making the source of the income irrelevant with respect to the apportionment rule, and thereby placing <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>income</b> from property back into the category of indirect taxes such as income from labor (the Sixteenth Amendment expressly stating that Congress has power to impose income taxes regardless of the source of the income, without apportionment among the states, and without regard to any census or enumeration).|$|E
5000|$|Throughout the 19th century, taxes changed little.
