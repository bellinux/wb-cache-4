5|$|This <b>thumb</b> <b>is</b> {{typically}} {{interpreted as}} a close-quarter stiletto-like weapon against predators, although it could also {{have been used to}} break into seeds and fruits, or against other Iguanodon. One author has suggested that the spike was attached to a venom gland, but this has not been accepted, as the spike was not hollow, nor were there any grooves on the spike for conducting venom.|$|E
5|$|A simple rule of <b>thumb</b> <b>is</b> {{that for}} {{high-pressure}} areas, where generally air {{flows from the}} center outward, the coriolis force given by the earth's rotation to the air circulation is {{in the opposite direction}} of earth's apparent rotation if viewed from above the hemisphere's pole. So, both the earth and winds around a low-pressure area rotate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern. The opposite to these two cases occurs {{in the case of a}} high. These results derive from the Coriolis effect; that article explains in detail the physics, and provides an animation of a model to aid understanding.|$|E
5|$|The mane of {{the adult}} male lion, unique among cats, {{is one of the}} most {{distinctive}} characteristics of the species. Although having a ruff is not so unusual for a lioness, in rare cases, a female lion can have a mane. The presence, absence, colour, and size of the mane is associated with genetic precondition, sexual maturity, climate, and testosterone production; the rule of <b>thumb</b> <b>is</b> the darker and fuller the mane, the healthier the lion. Sexual selection of mates by lionesses favours males with the densest, darkest mane. Research in Tanzania also suggests mane length signals fighting success in male–male relationships. Darker-maned individuals may have longer reproductive lives and higher offspring survival, although they suffer in the hottest months of the year.|$|E

40|$|The dermatoglyphs of 13 Japanese (eight {{males and}} five females) with {{duplication}} of the <b>thumb</b> <b>were</b> studied. The dermal {{patterns on the}} <b>thumb</b> <b>were</b> compared with those on the extra digit. A whorl on the <b>thumb</b> <b>was</b> associated with a whorl on the extra digit in two cases, a radial loop in four cases, and an arch in two cases. Where the <b>thumb</b> pattern <b>was</b> a loop the pattern on the extra digit was a loop in all three cases. Where the thumb and extra digit are both well developed the pattern {{tends to be the}} same on both digits. When the extra digit is poorly developed it tends to have a different pattern from the thumb...|$|R
5|$|Distributed element {{filters are}} mostly used at {{frequencies}} above the VHF (Very High Frequency) band (30 to 300 MHz). At these frequencies, the physical length of passive components {{is a significant}} fraction of the wavelength of the operating frequency, and it becomes difficult to use the conventional lumped element model. The exact point at which distributed element modelling becomes necessary depends on the particular design under consideration. A common rule of <b>thumb</b> <b>is</b> to apply distributed element modelling when component dimensions are larger than 0.1λ. The increasing miniaturisation of electronics has meant that circuit designs are becoming ever smaller compared to λ. The frequencies beyond which a distributed element approach to filter design becomes necessary are becoming ever higher {{as a result of}} these advances. On the other hand, antenna structure dimensions are usually comparable to λ in all frequency bands and require the distributed element model.|$|E
5|$|Fifth Avenue roughly bisects Manhattan Island {{and acts}} as the {{demarcation}} line for east/west designations (e.g., East 27th Street, West 42nd Street); street addresses start at Fifth Avenue and increase heading away from Fifth Avenue, {{at a rate of}} 100 per block on most streets. South of Waverly Place, Fifth Avenue terminates and Broadway becomes the east/west demarcation line. Though the grid does start with 1st Street, just north of Houston Street (the southernmost street divided in west and east portions; pronounced HOW-stin), the grid does not fully take hold until north of 14th Street, where nearly all east-west streets are numerically identified, which increase from south to north to 220th Street, the highest numbered street on the island. Streets in Midtown are usually one-way, with the few exceptions generally being the busiest cross-town thoroughfares (14th, 23rd, 34th, and 42nd Streets, for example), which are bidirectional across the width of Manhattan Island. The rule of <b>thumb</b> <b>is</b> that odd-numbered streets run west, while even-numbered streets run east.|$|E
5|$|Tom Thumb, Fielding's sixth play, {{was added}} to the ninth showing of The Author's Farce, 24 April 1730. Together, the shows lasted at the Haymarket until they were {{replaced}} by Fielding's next production, Rape upon Rape. Tom Thumb was later included with other productions, including Rape upon Rape, and later transformed into the Tragedy of Tragedies. In the print edition, Fielding added footnotes, prefaces, and prologues, which introduced the narratorial style found in Fielding's later works. The plot deals with the English hero, Tom Thumb, who is of only tiny proportions. After defeating a group of giants, Tom <b>Thumb</b> <b>is</b> handsomely rewarded by King Arthur, which later erupts in a comical love triangle between Tom, Arthur's wife Queen Dollalolla, and Princess Huncamunca. Tom is eventually swallowed by a cow and killed. Soon after, his ghost appears but meets an untimely death. This scene reportedly provoked Jonathan Swift to laughter, a rare feat. The farcical nature of Tom Thumb pokes fun at 17th and 18th-century tragedy, gender roles and gender politics.|$|E

25|$|The West Thumb Geyser Basin , {{including}} Potts Basin to the north, is {{the largest}} geyser basin {{on the shores of}} Yellowstone Lake. The heat source of the thermal features in this location is thought to be relatively close to the surface, only 10,000 feet (3,000 m) down. West <b>Thumb</b> <b>is</b> about the same size as another famous volcanic caldera, Crater Lake in Oregon, but much smaller than the great Yellowstone Caldera which last erupted about 640,000 years ago.

25|$|The {{evolution}} of the fully opposable <b>thumb</b> <b>is</b> usually associated with Homo habilis, a forerunner of Homo sapiens.

25|$|In {{the course}} of a shift in low positions, the thumb of the left hand moves up or down the neck of the {{instrument}} so as to remain in the same position relative to the fingers (though the movement of the thumb may occur slightly before, or slightly after, the movement of the fingers). In such positions, the <b>thumb</b> <b>is</b> often thought of as an 'anchor' whose location defines what position the player is in. In very high positions, the <b>thumb</b> <b>is</b> unable to move with the fingers as the body of the instrument gets in the way. Instead, the thumb works around the neck of the instrument to sit at {{the point at which the}} neck meets the right bout of the body, and remains there while the fingers move between the high positions.|$|E
