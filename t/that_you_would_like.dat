500|$|How is it <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> me {{to leave}} so many goods behind? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear Hawtrey, I {{would ask}} you a question. Has it ever entered your mind <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> Ned Hampton as a son-in-law?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anything more <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to ask, Mr. Holmes?" [...] said Lestrade, whose eyebrows {{had gone}} up once or twice during this {{remarkable}} explanation.|$|E
5000|$|... 19. Try not to {{do things}} to others <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not <b>like</b> them to do to you. The Way to Happiness, Precept 19 ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Aye, my poor boy, <b>that's</b> what <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> best, I've no doubt; {{but look}} at Edward's face there, and think what that would come to at the best!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've heard {{something}} <b>that</b> maybe <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to know," [...] went on Andy Royce. [...] "I've heard that Crowden was over at Leadenfield, {{to a small}} roadhouse kept {{by a man named}} Bissette, a Frenchman." ...|$|R
6000|$|You {{recently}} have said, I hear, [...] <b>That</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to go To serve as Senator. That's queer! [...] Have you told William Stow? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You said, {{speaking}} for your friend, {{that you could}} {{tell me how to}} do something useful and good. Something <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> done, is it not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{does that}} wish mean?" [...] she asked. [...] "Do you mean <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> {{to agree with}} me, or {{would you like to}} be twenty-nine?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will be all}} {{the better}} for you, O'Grady. Daly tells me that your arm is not fully healed yet. I know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not <b>like</b> {{to be left behind}} when we have once started." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of course not,' {{replied the}} doctor, with a nervous {{glance at the}} two ladies. 'I know his whole history: but {{we can talk about}} <b>that</b> presently. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>like,</b> first, to see the place where the thieves made their attempt, I suppose?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not so sure}} of that," [...] a light skirmisher {{broke his}} silence for the first time. [...] "Do you mean to say," [...] he asked of the first speaker, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not mind being found dead in your bed to-morrow morning, and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>like</b> it if that were {{actually}} the end of you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|MR. BARLOW. If {{you would}} be so kind. (Exit OLIVER.) Can't you find a sweet <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like,</b> my dear? Won't you take a little cherry brandy? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As much so as possible; {{they have}} hardly a way <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like,</b> my dear ma'am; and are as close-mouthed {{as if they}} were afraid of {{committing}} themselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You were saying," [...] he said, {{addressing}} {{himself to}} Gip, [...] "before you came in, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> {{one of our}} 'Buy One and Astonish your Friends' boxes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Desolately] Well? [She {{moves towards}} the door. Suddenly {{holding out the}} flower] Mr March gave me <b>that</b> flower; <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> it back? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dr. Tolbridge," [...] cried Miss Dora, {{her eyes}} sparkling, [...] "do <b>you</b> really mean <b>that?</b> <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> truly <b>like</b> {{to have an}} Angora kitten?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we {{have already}} given up the idea," [...] Mrs. Renshaw went on. [...] "Wilfrid was sure <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not <b>like</b> it, and, as he pointed out, the money might be spent before I could obtain {{sufficient}} pupils to pay. Besides, he is anxious to be of use; but the difficulty struck us of obtaining any kind of remunerative work here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose that}} means <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> him very much," [...] laughed Farmer Brown's boy. [...] "Do {{you think you}} can catch him if I let him out?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If, at any time," [...] {{he said to}} A. v. d. R., [...] "you feel <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> {{to reconsider}} your answer, send me a rose like that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This other gentleman," [...] {{observed}} Joe, by way {{of introducing}} Mr. Wopsle, [...] "is a gentleman <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to hear give it out. Our clerk at church." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit down, gentlemen," [...] cried Grant, {{striking}} {{his hands}} heartily. [...] "Sit down {{all of you}} and {{have a glass of}} wine. As you say, there is no harm in it, and if Captain Fraser had simply dropped me a hint I could have saved him from dropping a good sum of money. Not <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have <b>liked</b> <b>that,</b> eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} would," [...] said Rollo. [...] "I told them <b>that</b> I thought <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to see it, {{and they said}} that they should be very happy to show it to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Isn't Arrowdale {{near your}} aunts' {{place in the}} North?" [...] she said. [...] "There's {{a picture of the}} hills round it <b>that</b> I think <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like.</b> Ask Colonel Challoner to show it you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I will," [...] said I; [...] "why {{did you not}} ring, {{and let me know}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> fresh air? But I {{shall see}} to it to-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I am at ease again. Is there {{anything}} more <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to ask me?" [...] she said, with {{the matter of}} a queen rather than of a mother.|$|E
6000|$|... "That sounds quite absurd," [...] she answered. [...] "Yet {{it is my}} last evening, and I think--if you {{are sure}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to have me--that I will risk it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{first thought}} was," [...] she said, [...] "to {{advise you to}} tell father about all this, and take his advice about telling her, but I don't think <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> Now, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought it}} {{my duty to}} see you, Mr. Johnson, and to tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> {{it is a very}} nasty case. Your wife's heart is not strong, and she has some {{symptoms}} which I do not like. What I wanted to say is <b>that</b> if <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to have a second opinion I shall be very glad to meet any one whom you might suggest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{two were}} so close about him <b>that</b> I thought <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> {{me to be the}} same," [...] returns that old bird with a {{secretly}} glistening eye. [...] "Besides, I wasn't proud of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I suppose," [...] she said, {{her face}} turned up towards him, {{but her eyes}} cast down, [...] "that {{you are going to}} say <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to marry me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Funny thing," [...] Mr. Merrill continued, [...] "I {{was looking}} for you, Duncan. It {{occurred}} to me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to meet Mr. Wetherell. I was afraid you were in Boston." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That’s what he says," [...] replied Miss Drewitt, {{taking a}} low {{chair by the}} captain’s side and gazing composedly at the intruder. [...] "I told him <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to hear it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True enough," [...] laughed the Queen; [...] "but real, live people <b>would</b> not <b>like</b> to {{be treated}} <b>that</b> way. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> to see my village wake up?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I always {{believed}} what you said. You {{said at the}} picnic <b>that</b> day <b>that</b> <b>you</b> thought I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to live at Ponkwasset Falls if my business was there--" ...|$|R
6000|$|His {{resistance}} ceased. One hand supported her, {{the other}} patted her shining hair. [...] "My dear child!" [...] he said. [...] "My dear child! I had no idea. <b>That</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> take it <b>like</b> this...." ...|$|R
