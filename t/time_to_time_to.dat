Problems, though, still occur mainly {{in the form of}} large uncontrolled spills from the reservoir. Several concerns about the structural integrity and safety of the dam, both physically and biologically, arose in the 1990s. Emergency releases from Shasta Lake, often in the value of thousands of acre feet of water, have occurred from <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> dilute massive acid spills from the Spring Creek drainage.|$|E

5|$|Deinonychus fossils {{have been}} {{uncovered}} {{in small groups}} near {{the remains of the}} herbivore Tenontosaurus, a larger ornithischian dinosaur. This had been interpreted as evidence that these dromaeosaurids hunted in coordinated packs like some modern mammals. However, not all paleontologists found the evidence conclusive, and a subsequent study published in 2007 by Roach and Brinkman suggests that the Deinonychus may have actually displayed a disorganized mobbing behavior. Modern diapsids, including birds and crocodiles (the closest relatives of dromaeosaurids), display minimal long-term cooperative hunting (except the aplomado falcon and Harris's Hawk); instead, they are usually either solitary hunters, join forces <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> increase hunting success, or are drawn to previously killed carcasses, where conflict often occurs between individuals of the same species. For example, in situations where groups of Komodo dragons are eating together, the largest individuals eat first and might attack smaller Komodo dragons that attempt to feed; if the smaller animal dies, it is usually cannibalized. When this information is applied to the sites containing putative pack-hunting behavior in dromaeosaurids, it appears somewhat consistent with a Komodo dragon-like feeding strategy. Deinonychus skeletal remains found at these sites are from subadults, with missing parts that may have been eaten by other Deinonychus, which a study by Roach et al. presented as evidence against the idea that the animals cooperated in the hunt.|$|E
5|$|I am {{of opinion}} {{that by the}} terms and spirit of the statute under which this {{proceeding}} has been had, no other than the district attorney of the county of Genesee (in which the lands intruded upon are situated) could regularly be a relator.

It is made the duty of the district attorney to make complaint of all intrusions upon Indian lands forbidden by the act, and from <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> make inquiries whether any persons other than Indians are settled upon such lands, and to cause them to be removed in the manner therein prescribed. Without the act, John Blacksmith or any other person could not claim such summary proceedings to remove intruders upon Indian lands; and with the act, no other person is authorized by its provisions to make complaint of such intrusions, or to cause the intruders to be removed, but the district attorney of the county in which the lands are situated.|$|E

40|$|System {{characteristics}} of a repairable system are studied from a Bayesian viewpoint with different types of priors assumed for unknown parameters, in which the system consists of one active component and one standby component. The detection of standby, the coverage factor and reboot delay of failed components are possibly considered. <b>Time</b> <b>to</b> failure of the components is assumed <b>to</b> follow exponential distribution. <b>Time</b> <b>to</b> repair and <b>time</b> <b>to</b> reboot of the failed components also follow exponential distributions. When <b>time</b> <b>to</b> failure, <b>time</b> <b>to</b> repair and <b>time</b> <b>to</b> reboot have uncertain parameters, a Bayesian approach is adopted to evaluate system characteristics. Monte Carlo Simulation is used to derive the posterior distribution for the mean <b>time</b> <b>to</b> system failure and the steady-state availability. Some numerical experiments are performed to illustrate the results derived in this paper. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

In this fabless structure, EDA (electronic design automation) {{has emerged as a}} key stake holder to model increasing design and manufacturing interface complexities and its integration within design flow, but collaboration within alliances have resulted information sharing and technology transfer as the key challenges. We argue that IDM model is superior to a fabless structure due to its inherent ability for faster/superior knowledge capitalization. We benchmarked and analyzed a world reputed IDM with use-case and SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunity, threat) analyses to identify the limiting factors that led this transformation and found data and statistics as the core issues.
