5|$|Our {{solar system}} orbits within the Milky Way, a {{barred spiral galaxy}} that is a {{prominent}} member of the Local Group of galaxies. It is a rotating mass of gas, dust, stars and other objects, held together by mutual gravitational attraction. As the Earth is located within <b>the</b> <b>dusty</b> outer arms, there are large portions of the Milky Way that are obscured from view.|$|E
5|$|Computer {{simulations}} of <b>the</b> <b>dusty</b> disk orbiting Epsilon Eridani {{suggest that the}} shape of the disk may be explained by the presence of a second planet, tentatively dubbed Epsilon Eridanic. Clumping in the dust disk may occur because dust particles are being trapped in orbits that have resonant orbital periods with a planet in an eccentric orbit. The postulated Epsilon Eridanic would orbit at a distance of 40AU, with an eccentricity of 0.3 and a period of 280 years. The inner cavity of the disk may be explained by the presence of additional planets. Current models of planet formation cannot easily explain how a planet could have been created at this distance from Epsilon Eridani. The disk is expected to have dissipated long before a giant planet could have formed. Instead, the planet may have formed at an orbital distance of about 10AU, then migrated outward because of gravitational interaction with the disc or with other planets in the system.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter has a faint {{planetary}} ring system composed of three main segments: an inner torus of particles {{known as the}} halo, a relatively bright main ring, and an outer gossamer ring. These rings appear {{to be made of}} dust, rather than ice as with Saturn's rings. The main ring is probably made of material ejected from the satellites Adrastea and Metis. Material that would normally fall back to the moon is pulled into Jupiter because of its strong gravitational influence. The orbit of the material veers towards Jupiter and new material is added by additional impacts. In a similar way, the moons Thebe and Amalthea probably produce the two distinct components of <b>the</b> <b>dusty</b> gossamer ring. There is also evidence of a rocky ring strung along Amalthea's orbit which may consist of collisional debris from that moon.|$|E

5|$|When Eva {{was a year}} old, Duarte {{returned}} permanently to {{his legal}} family, leaving Juana Ibarguren and her children in penury. Ibarguren and her children were forced {{to move to the}} poorest area of Junín. Los Toldos was a village in <b>the</b> <b>dusty</b> region of Las Pampas, with a reputation as a desolate place of abject poverty. To support herself and her children, Ibarguren sewed clothes for neighbors. The family was stigmatized by the abandonment of the father and by the illegitimate status of the children under Argentine law, and was consequently somewhat isolated. A desire to expunge this part of her life might have been a motivation for Eva to arrange the destruction of her original birth certificate in 1945.|$|E

40|$|The dust-acoustic {{waves and}} their {{stability}} in <b>the</b> permeating <b>dusty</b> plasma with <b>the</b> Maxwellian velocity distribution are investigated. We derive the dust-acoustic wave frequency and instability growth rate in two limiting physical cases that the thermal velocity of <b>the</b> flowing <b>dusty</b> plasma is (a) much larger than, and (b) {{much smaller than}} the phase velocity of the waves. We find that the stability of the waves depend strongly on the velocity of <b>the</b> flowing <b>dusty</b> plasma in <b>the</b> permeating <b>dusty</b> plasma. <b>The</b> numerical analyses are made based on the example that a cometary plasma tail is passing through the interplanetary space plasma. We show that, in case (a), the waves are generally unstable for any flowing velocity, but in case (b), the waves become unstable only when the wave number is small and the flowing velocity is large. When the physical conditions are between these two limiting cases, we gain a strong insight into the dependence of the stability criterions on the physical conditions in <b>the</b> permeating <b>dusty</b> plasma.

25|$|The {{spectra of}} comets {{consist of a}} {{reflected}} solar spectrum from <b>the</b> <b>dusty</b> clouds surrounding the comet, as well as emission lines from gaseous atoms and molecules excited to fluorescence by sunlight and/or chemical reactions. For example, the chemical composition of Comet ISON was determined by spectroscopy due to the prominent emission lines of cyanogen (CN), as well as two- and three-carbon atoms (C2 and C3). Nearby comets can even be seen in X-ray as solar wind ions flying to the coma are neutralized. The cometary X-ray spectra therefore reflect {{the state of the}} solar wind rather than that of the comet.|$|E

25|$|The peasants {{are fairly}} well off, as {{the soil is}} rich, the {{abundant}} water-supply free, and the taxation comparatively light. It was always interesting to meet them taking their live stock into market. Flocks of sheep with tiny lambs, black and white, pattered along <b>the</b> <b>dusty</b> road; here a goat followed its master like a dog, trotting behind the diminutive ass which the farmer bestrode; or boys, clad in the whity-brown native cloth, shouted incessantly at donkeys almost invisible under enormous loads of forage, or carried fowls and ducks in bunches head downwards, a sight that always made me long {{to come to the}} rescue of the luckless birds.|$|E
25|$|The {{extremely}} bumpy Hermanos Rodriguez Autodrome in Mexico saw {{a number}} of incidents during practice, including Senna crashing at the very fast Peraltada while trying to take it a bit faster than usual and his car overturned when it hit the tire barrier. Senna had come to Mexico City with a head injury that he got while jetskiing in Brazil, and had been critical of <b>the</b> <b>dusty</b> circuit's condition all through the weekend. Williams took 1–2 in qualifying with Patrese ahead of Mansell, Senna, Alesi, Berger and Piquet. Patrese made a poor start and lost three places while Alesi dived ahead of Senna. The order was: Mansell, Alesi, Senna, Patrese, Berger and Piquet. There was action as Senna passed Alesi with Patrese following him through and then Modena getting by Piquet.|$|E
25|$|Although the park's terrain {{may appear}} rugged and durable, it is {{extremely}} fragile. More than 1 million visitors each year threaten the fragile high desert ecosystem. The problem lies within the soil's crust which is composed of cyanobacteria, algae, fungi, and lichens that grow in <b>the</b> <b>dusty</b> parts of the park. Factors that make Arches National Park sensitive to visitor damage include: semiarid region, and the scarce, unpredictable rainfall, lack of deep freezing, and lack of plant litter which results in soils that have both a low resistance to, and slow recovery from, compressional forces such as foot traffic. Methods of indicating effects on the soil are cytophobic soil crust index, measuring of water infiltration, and t-tests {{that are used to}} compare the values from the undisturbed and disturbed areas.|$|E

25|$|Molds are a {{large and}} taxonomically diverse number of fungal species in which the growth of hyphae results in {{discoloration}} and a fuzzy appearance, especially on food. The network of these tubular branching hyphae, called a mycelium, is considered a single organism. The hyphae are generally transparent, so the mycelium appears like very fine, fluffy white threads over the surface. Cross-walls (septa) may delimit connected compartments along the hyphae, each containing one or multiple, genetically identical nuclei. <b>The</b> <b>dusty</b> texture of many molds is caused by profuse production of asexual spores (conidia) formed by differentiation {{at the ends of}} hyphae. The mode of formation and shape of these spores is traditionally used to classify molds. Many of these spores are colored, making the fungus much more obvious to the human eye at this stage in its life-cycle.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1880s {{the hunt}} for Geronimo was on and Bigelow was {{involved}} with the search, patrolling out of Fort Grant. Many patrols were carried out and the public's attention {{was drawn to the}} hunt. Harper's Weekly sent a young Frederic Remington out to document the historic events. While Remington went out with various cavalry troops of the 10th, he met a friend of an old friend in <b>the</b> <b>dusty</b> west. Bigelow's brother Poultney Bigelow was a former Yale classmate of Remington and had remained in contact with him. This started a friendship which would last for decades. Bigelow allowed Remington to read his journals and see his sketches. While Bigelow never became proficient in his sketches, his journals became the basis of serial articles on {{the hunt for}} Geronimo for his brother's Outing magazine. Remington added a series of freelance sketches for the magazine that included his new friend, John Bigelow.|$|E
25|$|In 1889, No. 3 stack was raised, and No. 4 {{went out}} of service in July 1890. The Crane and Thomas Iron {{companies}} leased the C to the Reading Railroad on December 8, 1893, and Crane Iron sold off its share to the Reading entirely from June 5, 1896, leaving the line-haul railroad business. During the 1890s, Crane Iron also participated in the experiments of Thomas Edison, who was attempting to rejuvenate the then-moribund Eastern magnetite mines by magnetic beneficiation. Initial attempts were frustrated by <b>the</b> <b>dusty</b> nature of the finely-ground ore (which made it susceptible to losses both in transit and during the furnace blast), and the process ultimately proved uneconomical in competition with cheap Mesabi Range ores, which came to replace locally-mined ore. In 1899, the company was sold to the Empire Steel and Iron Company and became their Crane Works. The works was gradually dismantled, last making iron in 1930. It was scrapped in 1932.|$|E

50|$|The {{amount of}} refracted light {{depends on the}} amount of dust or clouds in the atmosphere; this also {{controls}} how much light is scattered. In general, <b>the</b> <b>dustier</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere, the more that other wavelengths of light will be removed (compared to red light), leaving the resulting light a deeper red color. This causes the resulting coppery-red hue of the moon to vary from one eclipse to the next. Volcanoes are notable for expelling large quantities of dust into the atmosphere, and a large eruption shortly before an eclipse can have a large effect on the resulting color.|$|R
