25|$|Dumézil's {{studies were}} delayed by World War I, {{when he was}} drafted and served as an {{artillery}} officer. After the war, he resumed them and was particularly influenced by Antoine Meillet. He aggregated in 1919 in Classics and received his doctorate in 1924 after writing a thesis comparing the common origins of the Greek ambrosia and a similarly named Indian drink Amrita, which was said to make its imbiber immortal. The dissertation was controversial {{because some of the}} examiners, such as Henri Hubert, thought that Dumézil took liberty with <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>to</b> generate a more beautiful interpretation (that was a common criticism of Dumézil's work).|$|E
25|$|The abbey's modest but {{sufficient}} wealth was threatened, before many of {{the grants}} were confirmed by royal charter, when Earl Roger's son, Robert of Bellême, revolted against Henry I in 1102. The king exiled and expropriated his unruly vassal and the patronage of the abbey escheated to the Crown. This deprived the abbey of powerful local protection and gave the descendants and successors of donors an opportunity to wriggle out of their obligations. For example, Siward had given up any claims {{he might have to}} the abbey site in return for a life-time grant from Earl Roger of the estate of Langafeld, now Cheney Longville, which would pass to the abbey on his death. Siward's son, Aldred, refused to surrender the estate to the abbey until Abbot Fulchred gave him £15. This arrangement was engineered by Richard de Belmeis I, later Bishop of London, whom the king had sent to exercise viceregal powers in Shropshire after Early Robert's expropriation. However, Richard was not to be trusted. On his death bed in 1127 he admitted to his confessors that he had lied about his tenure of Betton in Berrington, which really belonged to Shrewsbury Abbey – probably a grant from Robert de Limesey, then Bishop of Chester His confessor tried to clear up the matter by stating <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>to</b> the interested parties. Although Richard had directed that the estate be restored to Shrewsbury Abbey, its status was contested by his lay successors for decades. In 1127 Philip de Belmeis sued for the estate, although he quickly defaulted. His younger son, Ranulph, tried again a few decades later, but gave up in return for acceptance into the abbey's lay fraternity. As late as 1212 Roger de la Zouche launched a fresh suit, in which he persisted for years, unsuccessfully. These were only examples of a morass of complex litigation into which the abbey was drawn.|$|E

500|$|Angelou {{recognizes that}} there are fictional aspects to all her books; she tended to [...] "diverge from the {{conventional}} notion of autobiography as truth". Her approach parallel the conventions of many African-American autobiographies written during the abolitionist period in the US, when truth was often censored for purposes of self-protection. Author Lyman B. Hagen has placed Angelou in the long tradition of African-American autobiography, but insists that she has created a unique interpretation of the autobiographical form. In a 1998 interview with journalist George Plimpton, Angelou discusses her writing process, and [...] "the sometimes slippery notion of truth in nonfiction" [...] and memoirs. When asked if she changed the truth to improve her story, she stated, [...] "Sometimes I make a diameter from a composite {{of three or four}} people, because the essence in only one person is not sufficiently strong to be written about." [...] Although Angelou has never admitted to changing fact in her stories, she has used <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>to</b> make an impact with the reader. As Hagen states, [...] "One can assume that 'the essence of the data' is present in Angelou's work". Hagen also states that Angelou [...] "fictionalizes, to enhance interest". Angelou's long-time editor, Robert Loomis, agrees, stating that she could rewrite any of her books by changing the order of her facts to make a different impact on the reader.|$|E

2500|$|An {{action for}} {{conversion}} does not rest on knowledge or {{intent of the}} defendant.

The defendant is answerable for the conversion, {{no matter how good}} his intentions were, or how careful he has been, or how apparently well-founded was his belief that his tortious act was right.

[...] In other words, received opinion and tradition do not make for truth. Reason is solely a strategy for marshalling <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>to</b> fit a settled opinion of one's own. In this, God's law counts for nothing but what it will fetch in the course of debate. He gives an example of such atheism as Dr More's Natural Cabala Dr More is reported as giving a remarkably Muggletonian description of God's features then saying that scripture only uses this language so that [...] "vulgar opinion" [...] can understand it.
