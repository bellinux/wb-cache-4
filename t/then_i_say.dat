500|$|The basic {{legislative}} proposals of the [...] "Stanley plan," [...] the Washington Post reported, were {{worked out}} at a secret meeting on July 2 in the United States House Committee on Rules hearing room in the United States Capitol. At the meeting were Abbitt, Byrd, Gray, Smith, Tuck, Stanley, and seven Southside state legislators. The group agreed to a five-point legislative program: 1) No public school integration would be tolerated in Virginia; 2) School districts which integrated would lose state funding; 3) The state law permitting school districts to be sued would be repealed; 4) The power to assign students to schools would {{be taken away from}} local school boards and transferred to the governor; and 5) The governor would have the power to close any school district which integrated. Despite the group's many public statements supporting local control of schools, Tuck later remarked {{that the purpose of the}} plan was to prevent integration anywhere in Virginia: [...] "If they [...] won't stand with us <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> make 'em. We cannot compromise. ... If you ever let them integrate anywhere the whole state will be integrated in a short time." [...] Byrd in particular was a vocal supporter of the school closing proposal, and helped draft the other proposals in the plan.|$|E
2500|$|Critics have {{singled out}} {{the sixth and}} final season as {{the worst of the}} series. Lineberger remarked, [...] "I haven't {{attempted}} to hide my disappointment with this season. For the first time ever in my life as a Highlander enthusiast, I found myself utterly uncaptivated." [...] Oliver awarded the sixth season a score of 3.9 out of 10, saying: [...] "Like The X-Files, Highlander: The Series simply went on too long. If the star is wanting {{to get out of a}} show as much as Paul was ready to hang up his katana, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> let it go." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1890, {{and then}} again in 1891–92, Braham and her family (including two {{children}} under the age of four), together with other D'Oyly Carte regulars, including R. Scott Fishe, toured South America with the Edwin Cleary Opera Company, entertaining audiences in Buenos Aires, Montevideo, Valparaiso, Lima, Rio de Janeiro and other cities. [...] Braham played Yum-Yum in The Mikado, Mabel in The Pirates of Penzance, Aline in The Sorcerer, the title roles in Patience, Dorothy, Erminie [...] and Pepita, and in Billie Taylor. Braham received generally good notices. [...] The Standard said of her Dorothy in Buenos Aires, [...] "if her portrayal of the wayward English heiress is not perfect, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> emphatically there is no perfection in this imperfect world." [...] The company was shipwrecked off the west coast of South America in the middle of the tour, losing most of their possessions (but no lives were lost), and Braham's husband injured his arm. Even after this experience, Braham and family soon braved the dangers of ocean travel to tour for two years in South Africa, performing in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas and other light operas and grand opera, such as Pagliacci and Cavalleria rusticana.|$|E
