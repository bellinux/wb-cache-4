5|$|The Chew Valley {{is an area}} in North Somerset, England, {{named after}} the River Chew, which rises at Chewton Mendip, and joins the River Avon at Keynsham. Technically, the area of <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>is</b> bounded by the water {{catchment}} area of the Chew and its tributaries; however, the name Chew Valley is often used less formally to cover other nearby areas, for example, Blagdon Lake and its environs, which by a stricter definition {{are part of the}} Yeo Valley. <b>The</b> <b>valley</b> <b>is</b> an area of rich arable and dairy farmland, interspersed with a number of villages.|$|E

5|$|Data {{collected}} on Apollo 17 show that <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>is</b> composed primarily of feldspar-rich breccia {{in the large}} massifs surrounding the valley and basalt underlying the valley floor, covered by an unconsolidated layer of regolith, or mixed materials, formed by various geologic events. Taurus–Littrow {{was selected as the}} Apollo 17 landing site after the other candidates were eliminated for various reasons. The landing site was chosen with the objectives of sampling highland material and young volcanic material in the same location.|$|E
5|$|Most park {{visitors}} stay {{just for}} the day, and visit only those locations within Yosemite Valley that are easily accessible by automobile. There is a US$25-30 per automobile user fee to enter the park, depending on the season. Traffic congestion in <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>is</b> a serious problem during peak season, in summer. A free shuttle bus system operates year-round in the valley, and park rangers encourage people to use this system since parking within the valley during the summer is often nearly impossible to find.|$|E
5000|$|Wears <b>Valley</b> <b>is</b> {{named for}} Wear. Although the {{original}} name of <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>was</b> [...] "Crowson Cove," [...] after its first settler, Aaron Crowson, <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>was</b> using its current name by 1900.

5|$|The Red River Valley is {{the result}} of an ancient glacier carving its way south during the last Ice Age. Once the glacier receded, it formed a glacial lake called Lake Agassiz. <b>The</b> <b>valley</b> <b>is</b> formed from the ancient lake bed. The ancient beaches can still be seen as rolling hills west of the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} the rock in <b>the</b> <b>Valley</b> <b>is</b> inconsistent, ranging from finely-grained to coarse stone, the latter with the {{potential}} to be structurally unsound. The occasional layer of shale also caused construction and conservation difficulties, as this rock expands in the presence of water, forcing apart the stone surrounding it. It is thought that some tombs were altered in shape and size depending on the types of rock the builders encountered.|$|E
5|$|The valley {{also has}} {{a wide variety of}} small mammals with larger species {{including}} Eurasian badger (Meles meles) and deer (Cervidae). <b>The</b> <b>valley</b> <b>is</b> home to fifteen of the sixteen bats found in England including a roost, at Compton Martin Ochre Mine, for greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). A rare and endangered species, the greater horseshoe bat is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and is listed in Annex II of the 1992 European Community Habitats Directive.|$|E

The valley's name, coined by the Apollo 17 crew, was eventually approved by the International Astronomical Union in 1973.|$|E
5|$|US395 {{traverses}} {{the entire}} length of the Owens Valley, entering the valley near the former site of the Owens Lake. The valley, named for one of explorer John C. Fremont's guides, was primarily home to Timbisha and Paiutes before European settlement. Formerly a fertile lake and valley, Owens Lake and the southern portion of the valley are now dry. Water from <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>is</b> channeled for use by the City of Los Angeles, via the Los Angeles Aqueduct, in what is commonly called the California Water Wars.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} {{carried out}} before the flooding of Chew Valley Lake found evidence of people belonging to the consecutive periods known as Upper Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic (Old, Middle and New Stone Age), Bronze Age and Iron Age, comprising implements such as stone knives, flint blades {{and the head of}} a mace, along with buildings and graves. Other evidence of occupation from prehistoric times is provided by the henge monument at Stanton Drew, long barrow at Chewton Mendip, and Fairy Toot tumulus at Nempnett Thrubwell. Maes Knoll fort, on Dundry Down in the northern reaches of <b>the</b> <b>valley,</b> <b>is</b> a Scheduled Ancient Monument that dates from the Iron Age; it later served as a terminus for the early medieval Wansdyke earthworks.|$|E
50|$|During {{the early}} 14th century, <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered}} by various Nahua peoples, who established the ancient chiefdoms of Amecatl and Cocollán there.

5|$|Katarn {{retrieves}} the Valley's {{location and}} travels with Rebel Alliance agent and close friend Jan Ors to Ruusan, the planet on which <b>the</b> <b>Valley</b> <b>is</b> located. Jerec captures Ors and offers Katarn {{the choice to}} execute her or die. The decision Katarn makes here depends on the player's actions within the game up to this point. If Katarn has remained true to the light path he spares Ors, but if he has fallen {{to the dark side}} he kills her. With both paths, Katarn has a final confrontation with Jerec in the Valley of the Jedi's core. If the player chose the light side, the game concludes with Katarn being reunited with Ors and carving a monument to Rahn and his dead father; if the player chose the dark path, the game ends with Katarn becoming the new Emperor.|$|E

Nearby is where the Los Angeles Aqueduct is tapped from the Owens River; with more vegetation visible north of this point. In this portion of <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>is</b> Big Pine and the Big Pine Indian Reservation. From here to Bishop the highway is overlapped with SR 168.|$|E
5|$|The town is {{situated}} at {{the northern edge of}} the High Weald, a ridge of hard sandstone that runs across southern England from Hampshire along the borders of Surrey, West Sussex, East Sussex and Kent—the town's geology is illustrated by the exposed sandstone outcrops at the Wellington Rocks and High Rocks (a Site of Special Scientific Interest due to its exposed gulls), and the quarries at nearby Langton Green from which sandstone was taken to build houses in Tunbridge Wells. The town is sited {{at the head of a}} valley that runs south-east to Groombridge; like the River Teise, which originates in Tunbridge Wells, the stream in <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>is</b> one of the many tributaries of the River Medway, which runs through a much larger valley north of the High Weald.|$|E

5|$|The {{upper station}} of the incline has {{a gift shop}} that sells souvenirs and snack foods; a visitor center is also located {{adjacent}} to the station. The mechanical room housing the incline's electric motor and hoisting mechanism can be viewed from windows in the gift shop and {{the lobby of the}} visitor center. An observation deck providing views of the incline, the city, and <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>is</b> located {{on the opposite side of}} the station from the visitor center. Two hiking trails allow visitors to walk the slope. One is a sculpture trail, with works created in 1989 by local artist James Wolfe, who used remnants of the Bethlehem Steel factory in Johnstown.|$|E
5|$|The western slopes fall {{smoothly}} to {{the head}} of Thirlmere reservoir, and the tiny church at Wythburn. There are rougher areas, High and Comb Crags in particular, but these do little to change the overall impression of high moorland. The lower slopes have been planted with conifers as part of the Thirlmere Forest, but above this is a sense of wide open space. Nethermost Pike's toehold on <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>is</b> shifted a little to the south, relative to its position on the ridge. This is because Whelpside and Birkside Gills, its boundary streams, both run south-west, rather than flowing straight down the slope.|$|E
5|$|With the 2005 {{discovery}} of a new chamber and the 2008 {{discovery of}} two further tomb entrances, <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>is</b> known to contain 63 tombs and chambers (ranging in size from KV54, a simple pit, to KV5, a complex tomb with over 120 chambers). It was the principal burial place of the major royal figures of the Egyptian New Kingdom, {{as well as a}} number of privileged nobles. The royal tombs are decorated with scenes from Egyptian mythology and give clues as to the beliefs and funerary rituals of the period. Almost all of the tombs seem to have been opened and robbed in antiquity, but they still give an idea of the opulence and power of the Pharaohs.|$|E
50|$|It has <b>been</b> {{suggested}} that <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>was</b> formed during <b>the</b> ice age 10,000-20,000 {{years ago by}} glacial scouring, but considering that <b>the</b> Hutt <b>Valley</b> and <b>the</b> greater Wellington area have experienced major tectonic uplifting it <b>is</b> possible that <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>was</b> formed through major earthquakes and erosion.|$|R
