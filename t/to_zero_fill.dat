Chemical shifts were measured in {{parts per million}} (ppm) values relative {{to that of the}} solvent (residual DMSO [H 2.50; C 39.5]). 1 D NMR spectra were recorded (7183.91  Hz) with 256 or 512 data points <b>zero</b> <b>filled</b> <b>to</b> 256 or 512. 13 C spectra were acquired with 2  K data points <b>zero</b> <b>filled</b> <b>to</b> 16  K. 13 C spectra were recorded by using the DEPT pulse with proton pulse at 135 degrees. The spectra were measured under proton decoupling during acquisition and with DEPT polarization transfer pulse sequence. Homonuclear 1 H- 1 H correlation (COSY) was achieved with 1 H spectral width between 3033.98 and 7183.91  Hz and using eCOSY sequence with gradient pulses for selection. The data were recorded in 2  K data points in t 2 and 128 data points in t 1. Data were treated using TopSpin (version 1.3, Bruker GmbH).|$|R

Let G_n be a p× q matrix whose pq {{entries are}} independent standard normals. In this paper {{we consider the}} distance between √(n) Z_n and G_n {{in terms of the}} total variation distance, the Kullback-Leibler distance, the Hellinger distance and the Euclidean distance. We prove that each of the first three distances goes <b>to</b> <b>zero</b> as long as pq/n goes <b>to</b> <b>zero,</b> and not so this rate is sharp in the sense that each distance does not go <b>to</b> <b>zero</b> if (p, q) sits on the curve pq=σ n, where σ is a constant. However, it is different for the Euclidean distance, which goes <b>to</b> <b>zero</b> provided pq^ 2 /n goes <b>to</b> <b>zero,</b> and not so if (p,q) sits on the curve pq^ 2 =σ n. A previous work by Jiang Jiang 06 shows that the total variation distance goes <b>to</b> <b>zero</b> if both p/√(n) and q/√(n) go <b>to</b> <b>zero,</b> and it is not true provided p=c√(n) and q=d√(n) with c and d being constants. One of the above results confirms a conjecture that the total variation distance goes <b>to</b> <b>zero</b> as long as pq/n→ 0 and the distance does not go <b>to</b> <b>zero</b> if pq=σ n for some constant σ.
