5|$|On {{the day of}} the shooting—Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year—the two-story Israel Defense Forces (IDF) outpost at the Netzarim {{junction}} was {{manned by}} Israeli soldiers from the Givati Brigade Engineering Platoon and the Herev Battalion. According to Enderlin, <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>were</b> Druze.|$|E
5|$|Onlookers had {{gathered}} {{to watch the}} procession, and <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>were</b> attacked on Eutaw Street by crowds throwing bricks and stones. No serious damage was done, and they continued until again, on Eutaw near Camden Street, they were stopped by the crowd, who injured several with their missiles.|$|E
5|$|The army {{grew from}} 10,000 to 25,000 by 1978. Amin's army {{was largely a}} {{mercenary}} force. Half <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>were</b> South Sudanese and 26 percent Congolese, with only 24 percent being Ugandan, mostly Muslim and Kakwa.|$|E

5|$|Approximately 72 Virginia and Maryland National Guard Soldiers {{with the}} 29th ID {{deployed}} to Afghanistan from December 2010 to October 2011. As {{part of the}} 29th ID Security Partnering Team, <b>the</b> <b>Soldiers</b> <b>were</b> assigned to NATO's International Security Assistance Force Joint Command Security Partnering Team with the mission of assisting with the growth {{and development of the}} Afghan National Security Forces where they served as advisers and mentors to senior Afghan leaders. They were part of a NATO Coalition of 49 troop-contributing nations that Security Partnering personnel interacted with daily across Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Around 60,000 former Czar's army troopers {{remained}} {{stationed in}} Finland in January 1918. <b>The</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>were</b> demoralized and war-weary, and the home-sick, former serfs were thirsty for farmland set free by the revolutions. The {{majority of the}} troops returned to Russia {{by the end of}} March 1918. In total 7,000 to 10,000 Red Russian warmen supported the Finnish Reds, but around 4,000, in separate smaller units of 100–1,000 soldiers, could be persuaded to fight in the front line.|$|E
5|$|As it was {{the dinner}} hour, all <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>were</b> in barracks. Brock ordered the drummers to call out the men. He ordered the first officer on the scene, Lieutenant Williams, to bring him a soldier {{suspected}} {{of being one of}} the mutiny's ringleaders. Pinning the man with a sabre, Williams took him into custody. The other suspected mutineers were also captured.|$|E

50|$|During the Iranian Revolution, on 13 May 1978, the Piruz {{incident}} {{took place}} near Piruz, when several students travelling by bus Malayer were stopped at an army check point and shoot. On several demonstrations in Hamadan Province {{the punishment of}} <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>was</b> demanded, but only one of <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>was</b> sentenced.|$|R
5|$|Despite the defeat, <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>were</b> {{received}} as heroes in Santiago. Thanks to Las Heras, a potential {{disaster for the}} patriot armies turned into a minor setback. The army was reorganized again, but the deaths, injuries and desertions caused by the defeat at Cancha Rayada reduced its size to 5,000 soldiers, which was closer to the royalist forces. They took position next to the Maipo River, near Santiago.|$|E
5|$|For these {{long-range}} desert operations, it {{was necessary}} for all supplies to be well-organised and suitably packaged for transportation on camels, moving with the column or following closely behind. It was vital that <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>were</b> well trained for these conditions. If a man was left behind in the inhospitable Sinai, he might die in the burning desert sun during the day, or bitter cold at night. If a water bottle was accidentally tipped up or leaked, it could mean no water for its owner, for perhaps 24 hours in extreme temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{soldiers}} {{of the task force}} were teenagers with no combat experience and only eight weeks of basic training. Only one third of the officers in the task force had combat experience from World War II, and only one in six enlisted soldiers had combat experience. Many of them nevertheless volunteered to join the task force. <b>The</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>were</b> each equipped with only 120 rounds of ammunition and two days of C-rations.|$|E
50|$|On legend {{states that}} a <b>soldier</b> who <b>was</b> wounded when an {{arrowhead}} was embedded in his head. <b>The</b> <b>soldier,</b> who <b>was</b> in great pains, invoked the intercession of St. Ludolph, and <b>the</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>was</b> soon able {{to remove the}} arrow and was healed.|$|R

5|$|On 7 October 2000, three Israeli {{soldiers}} – Adi Avitan, Staff Sgt. Benyamin Avraham, and Staff Sgt. Omar Sawaidwere – were {{abducted by}} Hezbollah while patrolling the Israeli {{side of the}} Israeli-Lebanese border. <b>The</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>were</b> killed either during the attack or in its immediate aftermath. Israel Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz has, however, said that Hezbollah abducted the soldiers and then killed them. The bodies of the slain soldiers were exchanged for Lebanese prisoners in 2004.|$|E
5|$|On 8–9 July 1960, <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>were</b> {{invited to}} appoint black officers, and 'command {{of the army}} passed {{securely}} {{into the hands of}} former sergeants,' as the soldiers in general chose the most-educated and highest-ranked Congolese army soldiers as their new officers. Most of the Belgian officers were retained as advisors to the new Congolese hierarchy, and calm returned to the two main garrisons at Leopoldville and Thysville. The Force Publique was renamed the Armée nationale congolaise (ANC), or Congolese National Armed Forces. However, in Katanga Belgian officers resisted the Africanisation of the army.|$|E
5|$|On Friday, May 14, the Syrian 1st Infantry Brigade, {{commanded}} by Colonel Abdullah Wahab el-Hakim, was in Southern Lebanon, positioned to attack Malkia. That day Hakim {{was ordered to}} return to Syria, move south across the Golan and enter Palestine south of the Sea of Galilee through Samakh (Tzemah). He began to advance at 9:00 AM on Saturday and had only two of his battalions, where <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>were</b> already exhausted.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after these}} events, Russia {{experienced}} the February Revolution, which brought to power a liberal Russian Provisional Government. As {{a consequence of}} these, the whole transfer project was delayed, but the Russian acceptance of self-determination facilitated renewed political action. According to veteran Simion Gocan, <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>were</b> inspired by both these revolutionary promises and the American entry into World War I, which seemingly made Wilsonian Self-Determination an official Entente policy.|$|E
5|$|The 38th, {{along with}} the 45th Holding, the 47th Infantry (Reserve) and the 48th Infantry (Reserve) Division, were used to {{complete}} the training of new army recruits. At the division, <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>were</b> given five weeks of further training at the section, platoon and company level, before undertaking a final three-day exercise. Troops would then be ready to be sent overseas to join other formations.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Messolonghi, Western Europe decided to {{intervene}} in favour of revolutionary Greece. Their attitude toward the Ottoman Empire's Egyptian ally, Ibrahim Pasha, was especially critical; their primary objective was to elicit the evacuation of the occupied regions, the Peloponnese in particular. The intervention began when a Franco-Russo-British fleet {{was sent to the}} region, winning the Battle of Navarino in October 1827. In August 1828, a French expeditionary corps disembarked at Koroni in the southern Peloponnese. <b>The</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>were</b> stationed on the peninsula until the evacuation of Egyptian troops in October, then taking control of the principal strongholds still held by Turkish troops. Although the bulk of the troops returned to France from the end of 1828, there was a French presence in the area until 1833.|$|E

5|$|Euryalus {{became the}} {{flagship}} of Rear Admiral Rosslyn Wemyss in April, {{after he was}} put in charge of the main landings at Gallipoli. During the landings at Cape Helles on the morning of 25 April, Euryalus transported three companies of the 1st Battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers and a platoon of the Royal Naval Division, and then provided fire support to the landing after <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>were</b> transferred to their boats for the actual landing on Beach 'W'. She also bombarded Turkish positions during the Second Battle of Krithia on 6 May. A month later, Wemyss hauled down his flag and resumed his original commanding of the Allied base at Mudros. Euryalus received a brief refit at Malta from 30 December 1915 to 20 January 1916 before proceeding to Egypt to reinforce the defences there.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, {{there was}} an army camp held in the grounds of Somerhill. <b>The</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>were</b> housed in bell tents. On Sir Osmond's death in 1940, it then passed to his eldest son Sir Henry. During the Second World War, Somerhill {{was the site of}} a Prisoner of War camp, known as POW Camp No. 40. Italian POWs were amongst those housed at Somerhill. The Army were in {{possession}} of Somerhill from 1940–49. Squatters occupied some of the 40-plus huts in 1948, they were locked in by the Colonel in charge of the camp at the time.|$|E
5|$|In February 2014, Chief of Staff Brigadier General Dahir Adan Elmi {{announced}} that Somalia's Ministry of Defence began holding military training {{inside the country}} for the first time, with Somali instructors now teaching courses to units that joined the armed forces. He also indicated that SNA leaders had created new numbered units for the army, and that <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>were</b> slated to have their respective name and unit placed on their uniform. Additionally, Elmi stated that the military had implemented a new biometric registration system, wherein each recently trained and armed soldier is photographed and fingerprinted. By the end of 2014, 17,000 national army soldiers and police officers had registered for the new biometric remuneration system. 13,829 SNA soldiers and 5,134 Somali Police Force officials were biometrically registered in the system as of May 2015.|$|E
