5|$|Tool use in orangutans was {{observed}} by primatologist Birutė Galdikas in ex-captive populations. In addition, evidence of sophisticated tool manufacture and {{use in the}} wild was reported from a population of orangutans in Suaq Balimbing (Pongo abelii) in 1996. These orangutans developed a <b>tool</b> <b>kit</b> for use in foraging that consisted of both insect-extraction tools {{for use in the}} hollows of trees and seed-extraction tools for harvesting seeds from hard-husked fruit. The orangutans adjusted their tools according {{to the nature of the}} task at hand, and preference was given to oral tool use. This preference was also found in an experimental study of captive orangutans (P. pygmaeus).|$|E

500|$|In {{engineering}} and signal processing, the delta function, {{also known as}} the unit impulse symbol, may be regarded through its Laplace transform, as coming from the boundary values of a complex analytic function of a complex variable. [...] The formal rules obeyed by this function are part of the operational calculus, a standard <b>tool</b> <b>kit</b> of physics and engineering. In many applications, the Dirac delta is regarded as a kind of limit (a weak limit) of a sequence of functions having a tall spike at the origin. [...] The approximating functions of the sequence are thus [...] "approximate" [...] or [...] "nascent" [...] delta functions.|$|E

500|$|Great Moments in Aviation {{was written}} by Jeanette Winterson, {{directed}} by Beeban Kidron and produced by Phillippa Giles, the same creative team who, in 1990, adapted Winterson's novel Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit for television. Giles, for whom Great Moments was her first feature film, believes {{that it was the}} success of Oranges which lead the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) to approve the film so easily. The screenplay is inspired by the emigration story of the mother of actress Vicky Licorish, a close friend of Winterson. It is adapted from a short story Winterson wrote entitled [...] "Atlantic Crossing", published in 1999 in her anthology The World and Other Places. The central themes of the story are [...] "race, Hemingway, colonialism, love, lust, the [...] '50s", adapted into the screenplay in a manner Winterson intended to be reminiscent of a fairytale. She ascribes the roles of hero and heroine to Duncan and Gabriel, fairy godmothers to Miss Quim and Dr Bead, and non-archetypal villain to Rex Goodyear. Setting the film on a passenger liner, with brief scenes in Gabriel's native Grenada were intended to contribute towards this fairytale atmosphere, with Winterson explaining that the opening sequence in the Caribbean is [...] "designed to draw the audience out of the world of their own concerns and into a world whose customs are strange. In the new world, objects are unfamiliar and events do not follow the usual rules. The coincidence of colour and language, each more vivid than normal, pull the viewer forward with fairytale immediacy." [...] Of the passenger liner aspect, she explains that it provides the film with: [...] "a sealed and contained world with its own identity and rituals, at once both recognisable and odd. Fairytale never leaves the reader in a familiar spot, we are whisked away to a wood or a lake or a castle or an island, each a law unto itself made all the more uncomfortable because it isn't as weird as, say, planet Mars.

40|$|Most {{studies on}} poverty {{alleviation}} and reduction programmes emphasize structural bottlenecks, asymmetric information, and rent seeking behaviour. This paper provides an analytical {{characterization of the}} beneficiaries {{in a situation of}} much structural and conditional rigidity, where all beneficiaries do not move from a passive state to an active state and take advantage of the government intervention despite their having access to the benefit. From an ordered logistic analysis of primary data collected from the Supply of Improved <b>Tool</b> <b>Kits</b> to Rural Artisans (SITRA programme) in 2001 - 02, the study reveals that factors such as demographic characteristics, incomes from other sources, gender, {{and the quality of the}} <b>tool</b> <b>kits</b> are important variables affecting their economic behaviour.

2500|$|The <b>tool</b> <b>kit</b> was {{appropriate}} to the economy. Flint and obsidian were the main materials used for points and cutting edges. There {{is no sign of}} metal. For example, they harvested with sickles manufactured by inserting flint blades into the inside of curved pieces of wood. One diagnostic tool, the [...] "shoe-last celt", was made of a ground stone chisel blade tied to a handle. The blade was pulled over a piece of wood by the handle, removing flakes, {{in a manner similar to}} a plane. Augurs were made of flint points tied to sticks that could be rotated. Scrapers and knives are found in abundance. The use of flint pieces, or microliths, descended from the Mesolithic, while the ground stone is characteristic of the Neolithic.|$|E
2500|$|Imagination, {{as part of}} the <b>tool</b> <b>kit</b> {{of artists}} or scholars, helps create meaning that invokes a {{response}} from an audience. Since a humanities scholar is always within the [...] of lived experiences, no [...] "absolute" [...] knowledge is theoretically possible; knowledge is instead a ceaseless procedure of inventing and reinventing the context a text is read in. Poststructuralism has problematized an approach to the humanistic study based on questions of meaning, intentionality, and authorship. In the wake of the death of the author proclaimed by Roland Barthes, various theoretical currents such as deconstruction and discourse analysis seek to expose the ideologies and rhetoric operative in producing both the purportedly meaningful objects and the hermeneutic subjects of humanistic study. This exposure has opened up the interpretive structures of the humanities to criticism humanities scholarship is [...] "unscientific" [...] and therefore unfit for inclusion in modern university curricula because of the very nature of its changing contextual meaning.|$|E

First, by means of the Critical Incident Technique, a conceptual model was developed incorporating the aspects that are associated with engineers' preferences for either separate <b>tools</b> or <b>tool</b> <b>kits</b> in servicing lithography equipment. Next, the actual preferences and most important determinants were established through a survey among engineers worldwide. The results show a preference for <b>tool</b> <b>kits,</b> both in general and for all phases of the maintenance process. Many aspects appear to {{play a significant role in}} this preference, such as packing, convenience, characteristics of the repair action, uncertainty, and time.
