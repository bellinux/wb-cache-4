5|$|On November 23, {{the league}} and the players agreed to resume {{negotiating}} on November 25. On November 26, after 15 hours of <b>talks,</b> <b>a</b> tentative deal was reached. The NBPA re-formed as a union on December 1, receiving support from over 300 players, exceeding the requirement for at least 260 signatures. Signature cards {{were sent to the}} roughly 440players on rosters {{at the end of the}} previous season, as well as to the 60rookies drafted in 2011 and to players who signed at least two 10-day contracts. The re-formation enabled further negotiations with the league on secondary issues such as the age limit for the NBA draft and rules on players being sent to and recalled from the NBA D-League. The players and owners concluded their voting on the deal on December 8, when the deal was ratified, and the lockout ended after 161 days. The owners approved the deal by a 25–5 vote, while 86% of the more than 200 players who voted approved the deal. Miami Heat's Micky Arison and Dallas Mavericks' Mark Cuban are the two owners who have publicly disclosed that they voted against the new CBA.|$|E
5|$|The Canadiens' {{dominance}} in the late 1970s was {{due in part to}} the presence of the rival World Hockey Association (WHA) (which had begun play in 1972) — the Canadiens were far more successful compared to other NHL teams in resisting WHA efforts to lure away top talent. The Canadiens played a central role in the 1979 merger with the WHA, which added the Edmonton Oilers, Hartford Whalers, Quebec Nordiques and Winnipeg Jets to the NHL. After years of <b>talks,</b> <b>a</b> merger agreement was reached between the two leagues, but the NHL's governors rejected the deal by one vote. Most of the NHL's American teams were in favour of the merger in part because they thought it would help them challenge Montreal's dominance, whereas against the deal were the Canadiens, who, along with the Vancouver Canucks and Toronto Maple Leafs, opposed splitting Hockey Night in Canada television revenues six ways instead of three. Upon hearing the result of the vote, fans in Edmonton, Quebec and Winnipeg launched a massive boycott of products sold by Molson, owners of the Canadiens since 1978. The boycott, along with pressure from the Canadian House of Commons, led Montreal and Vancouver to reverse their positions when a re-vote was held on March 22, 1979, allowing the merger to pass.|$|E

However, on the UK Albums Chart, <b>Talk</b> <b>a</b> Good Game failed to match Here I Ams peak position of forty-three, only managing to debut at number eighty. As a result, it became Rowland's lowest charting album in the UK to date. In the US, <b>Talk</b> <b>a</b> Good Game debuted on the Billboard 200 chart at number four, having sold 68,000copies; it became Rowland's third top-ten album, though sold 9,000copies fewer than Here I Am. <b>Talk</b> <b>a</b> Good Game also debuted at number four on the Top R/Hip-Hop Albums, failing to match Here I Ams peak of number one. In its second week, the album dropped to number 11. As of December 2013, <b>Talk</b> <b>a</b> Good Game has sold 215,000 copies worldwide.|$|R

25|$|On 28 April 1975, North Vietnamese forces fought {{their way}} into the {{outskirts}} of the capital. Later that afternoon, as President Minh finished his acceptance speech, in which he called for an immediate cease-fire and peace <b>talks,</b> <b>a</b> formation of five A-37s, captured from the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, bombed Tân Sơn Nhứt. As Biên Hòa fell, General Nguyễn Văn Toàn, the III Corps commander, fled to Saigon, saying that most of the top ARVN leadership had virtually resigned themselves to defeat. The inauguration of Minh had served as a signal to South Vietnamese officers who would not compromise with the communists. They began to pack up and leave, or commit suicide to avoid capture.|$|E
25|$|Debates {{between the}} Socialist Party of Great Britain {{and other groups}} were of {{particular}} importance in bringing the party case to an outside audience without the sometimes off-putting rhetoric of platform speaking, or the one-sidedness of educational <b>talks.</b> <b>A</b> prime instance of this importance for the party {{is the case of}} Richard Headicar, a former Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament speaker, won over after debating with the party. Of rather wider historical importance were the debates with the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP) in the late 1940s. In the course of these Sammy Cash persuaded the RCP’s Jock Haston of the view that the Soviet Union was state capitalist. The idea was then relayed to Tony Cliff, whence (in a somewhat different form) it formed the genesis of today's Socialist Workers Party.|$|E
25|$|Hussein {{could not}} {{participate}} in the details of the <b>talks,</b> <b>a</b> task he handed to his brother Hassan. Hussein was referred to the Mayo Clinic in the United States after having urological problems; he had his left kidney removed after tests showed his ureter contained precancerous cells. When Hussein went back healed to Jordan, he received a hero's welcomea third of Jordan's population filled the streets to greet him. On 23November 1992 he gave an unusually aggressive speech. He called on extremists on both the right and left of the political spectrum to end their opposition to the peace negotiations, denounced what he saw as the Gulf countries' undemocratic nature, and called on Saddam to introduce democracy to Iraq. Meanwhile, Yitzhak Rabin, under the leftist Labor Party, emerged as prime minister of Israel. Thus, the PLO and Israeli representatives were quick to reach an agreement, which culminated in the 1993 Oslo Accords. The Accords were held in secrecy between Arafat and Rabin without Hussein's knowledge, completely marginalizing Jordan and the Palestinian-Jordanian delegation in Washington.|$|E

[...] Following the success of the talks between their two parties, Clegg and Cameron held a second round of face-to-face discussions at Westminster that evening, lasting 45 minutes.|$|E
500|$|The {{store is}} famous for its author events, in which writers usually read an excerpt from their book and take {{questions}} from the audience. The Washington Post notes that as the talks gained prominence and the store grew more popular, Cohen and Meade, the original co-owners, [...] "became known as literary tastemakers". C-SPAN broadcasts around five of the <b>talks</b> <b>a</b> month, and the store has gained a reputation for having astute and smart audiences present at readings. Famous readers at its author events have included politicians such as Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, and former Senator Edward Brooke, authors J.K. Rowling, Salman Rushdie, and Amy Chua, photographer Annie Leibovitz, and investigative reporter David Halberstam. Cohen in the past refused to allow some prominent writers to appear in the store, such as Matt Drudge, ostensibly because of their conservative leanings.|$|E

Seeing him at a bus stop while vacationing in Savannah, Georgia, Cox was [...] "attracted to him, but not in some kind of like, just physical way." [...] Seeing [...] "his melancholy, his sitting alone, staring at the ground", he [...] "fell in love" [...] with him. Cox and his family later drove to a beach; [...] "Winter Vacation" [...] relates to Cox’s memory of the beach, being [...] "infected with that new love" [...] found after meeting Pundt. The words of [...] "Scraping Past" [...] are about [...] "moving on…And wondering if somebody is going to come with you or…stay behind." [...] This uncertainty is characterized by several lines Cox considers [...] "pop song clichés", referencing [...] "rain that comes and goes." [...] In the song, Cox asks Pundt, [...] "Are you going to come with me, or are you staying here?" [...] In [...] "Ativan" [...] Cox examines his addiction to the drug of the same name, as well as his relationship with Pundt. [...] "It <b>talks</b> <b>a</b> lot about how things have changed between me and Lockett's relationship and how he's met a girl and…our friendship is never gonna change, but it's difficult sometimes." [...] Cox asserts that he would [...] "rather just take whatever drugs it takes to go to sleep and sleep through it…I'm not prepared to face it yet." ...|$|E
