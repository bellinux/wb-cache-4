40|$|Historically, the Indian {{textiles}} and clothing industry has comparative advantage in production and exports {{which could not be}} fully utilized because of quantitative restrictions imposed by her major export markets such as USA and European Union. It was therefore, envisaged that with the implementation of WTO’s agreement on textile and clothing (ATC) in 2005 the country would become more successful in global markets. Although in the initial two years of phasing out of quotas, the industry performed better, but the gains could not be sustained.

This study evaluated the sewability of <b>technical</b> <b>textile</b> {{in relation to the}} sewing needle penetration force (SNPF). The measuring system depends on measuring the change of the electric power under dynamic conditions by using measuring electric circuit and a digital oscilloscope connected to a PC computer. Sewability is defined as a maximum needle penetration force (CN), measurements are realized on home, sewing machine at 100 spm. For sewing the two layers of geotextile (GT) are used. For treatment of results the semi-symmetrical frequency distribution is assumed. Also it was found that needle penetration force and geotextile compressional properties are well related to each other. As can be seen, the results reveal one common feature, i. e. the higher the compressional properties the higher the seam sewability index (less sewing troubles).
