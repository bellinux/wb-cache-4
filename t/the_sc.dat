We aim at investigating the optimal supercapacitors-battery combination versus <b>the</b> <b>SCs</b> cost. This investigation is threefold; first, supercapacitors and battery models developed using MATLAB/Simulink are presented and validated. Second, the architecture and the simulation of the designed system that combines <b>the</b> <b>SCs</b> and <b>the</b> battery are shown. The supercapacitors are used as high-power storage devices to smooth the peak power applied to the battery during backup time and to deliver full power during short grid outages. By charging <b>the</b> <b>SCs</b> through <b>the</b> battery at a suitable rate, all impulse power demands would be satisfied by the supercapacitors. Third, extensive simulations are carried out to determine the gain in battery RMS current, the gain in energy losses, the energy efficiency and the elimination rate of surge load power. These four performance parameters are determined by simulation and then analyzed. The influence of <b>the</b> <b>SCs</b> recharge on <b>the</b> performance indicators is highlighted.

5|$|After {{the release}} of the Lexus brand in the Japanese {{domestic}} market in 2005, Lexus sanctioned the entry of four SC 430 coupes in the Super GT series of the All Japan Grand Touring Car Championship in the GT500 class. In the first race of the 2006 series, an SC 430 took the chequered flag, and drivers André Lotterer and Juichi Wakisaka raced <b>the</b> <b>SC</b> 430 to capture the GT500 championship for that year. In 2007, another SC 430 won the GT500 opening round race. In 2006, Lexus raced a hybrid vehicle for the first time, entering a GS 450h performance hybrid sedan in partnership with Sigma Advanced Racing Development at the 24 Hours of Tokachi race in Hokkaido, Japan. Lexus Canada also entered the GS 450h in 2007's Targa Newfoundland event. In 2009, Lexus Super GT Team SC 430 and IS 350 racers won the GT500 and GT300 championships, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, {{during its}} first full year of sales, Lexus sold 63,594 LS 400 and ES 250 sedans in the U.S., the {{majority}} being the LS model. That year, Lexus also began limited exports to the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Canada and Australia. In 1991, Lexus launched its first sports coupe, <b>the</b> <b>SC</b> 400, which shared the LS 400’s V8 engine and rear-wheel drive design. This {{was followed by the}} second generation ES 300 sedan, which succeeded the ES 250 and became Lexus' top seller. At the conclusion of 1991, Lexus had become the top-selling premium car import in the U.S., with sales reaching 71,206 vehicles. That year, Lexus ranked highest in J.D. Power and Associates' studies on initial vehicle quality, customer satisfaction and sales satisfaction for the first time. The marque also began increasing U.S. model prices past those of comparable American premium makes, but still below high-end European models. By 1992, the LS 400's base price had risen 18 percent.|$|E
5|$|In October 2007, Lexus {{entered the}} Specialty Equipment Market Association {{show in the}} U.S. {{for the first time}} with the IS F, and {{announced}} its F-Sport performance trim level and factory-sanctioned accessory line.

Models such as <b>the</b> <b>SC</b> 400 and GS 400 had received favorable reactions from sport luxury buyers, most Lexus models had been characterized as favoring comfort over sporty road feel and handling, compared with European rivals. By the end of 2007, Lexus annual worldwide sales had surpassed 500,000 vehicles, and the marque ranked as the top-selling premium import in China for the first time. The largest sales markets in order of size for 2007 were the U.S., Japan, the UK, China, Canada, and Russia.|$|E

New generation LS, IS, ES, GS, and RX models subsequently became available in Japan along with <b>the</b> <b>SC</b> 430, ending domestic sales of Toyota-branded models under the Celsior, Altezza, Windom, Aristo, Harrier, and Soarer nameplates, respectively. The Altezza and Aristo were previously exclusive to Japanese Toyota retail sales channels called Toyota Vista Store, the Windom was exclusive to Toyota Corolla Store, the Celsior and Harrier were exclusive to Toyopet Store, and the Soarer was previously available at both Toyota Store and Toyopet Store locations. Lexus models sold in Japan featured higher specifications and a price premium compared with their discontinued Toyota counterparts. Sales for the first half-year were slower than expected, affected by the contraction of the domestic auto market and price increases, but improved in subsequent months with an expanded lineup.|$|E

25|$|Using <b>the</b> <b>SC</b> as a model, {{the nature}} of this {{dichotomy}} can be analysed. In the newborn cat, deep layers of <b>the</b> <b>SC</b> contain only neurons responding to the somatosensory modality.

Further changes continue, with the arrival of visual neurons after three weeks, until <b>the</b> <b>SC</b> has achieved its fully mature structure after three to four months. Concurrently in species of monkey, newborns are endowed with a significant complement of multisensory cells; however, along with cats there is no integration effect apparent until much later. This delay is thought {{to be the result of}} the relatively slower development of cortical structures including the AES; which as stated above, is essential for the existence of the integration effect.|$|E
