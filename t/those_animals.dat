5|$|Belle Vue was {{the first}} privately financed zoo in England, and grew to become the third-largest in the UK. Jennison's {{original}} idea was that the gardens should be primarily a botanical excursion, but {{it became clear that}} the public was interested in the animals as an attraction in their own right. The initial collection had consisted of domestic birds and a few exotic parrots, but Jennison probably also acquired <b>those</b> <b>animals</b> that could not be sold after the Manchester Zoological Gardens closed in 1842. By 1856, the Jennisons had added kangaroos, rhinos, lions, bears and gazelles.|$|E
5|$|Transandinomys {{species are}} medium-sized, soft-furred rice rats. They closely {{resemble}} other medium-sized lowland forest rice rats, such as Hylaeamys and Euryoryzomys from the Amazon rainforest and surrounding areas and Handleyomys alfaroi from Central America and northwestern South America. In general, Transandinomys are distinguished from <b>those</b> <b>animals</b> {{by their very}} long superciliary vibrissae (whiskers above the eyes). Euryoryzomys species are in general slightly larger and Hylaeamys are about as large as Transandinomys, so that the only feature of external morphology that distinguishes the two genera is {{the length of the}} vibrissae. Handleyomys alfaroi is smaller than both species of Transandinomys, but juvenile Transandinomys may be confused with similarly colored adult H.alfaroi.|$|E
5|$|Turbinates {{are thin}} bones or cartilages {{that come in}} two types, with two functions. Nasal {{olfactory}} turbinates are found in all living tetrapods and function in smell. Respiratory turbinates function to prevent water loss through evaporation and are found only in birds and mammals, modern endotherms (warm-blooded animals) who could lose {{a great deal of}} water while breathing because they breathe more often than comparably sized ectotherms (cold-blooded animals) to support their higher metabolism. Ruben and others in 1996 concluded that respiratory turbinates were probably not present in Nanotyrannus, Ornithomimus or Hypacrosaurus based on CT scanning, thus {{there was no evidence that}} <b>those</b> <b>animals</b> were warm-blooded.|$|E

5|$|In Japan alone, 39confiscations {{including}} 363live {{animals were}} made between 1998 and 2006, with 2006 being the peak year. During {{the same time}} period, Thai, Indonesian, and Singaporean officials discovered 358lorises destined for Japan. Details of several confiscations from smuggling attempts between Thailand and Japan have been reported by the IPPL, including one event on 2May 2007, where 40slow lorises were confiscated at Narita Airport only {{a month before the}} CITES conference that elevated the slow loris status to Appendix I. Twelve of <b>those</b> <b>animals</b> died. The deaths are not unusual, with a mortality rate of 76% for all species of confiscated slow lorises, many dying before they are transferred to zoos. The JWCS suspects that the high mortality rate among smuggled slow lorises causes traders to smuggle more slow lorises than are needed to supply the market.|$|E
5|$|Metanephrops challengeri is {{currently}} listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, {{due in part}} to the Quota Management System put in place by the New Zealand government. The species does appear to be declining, however, based both on burrow counts and analyses of catch per unit effort. Estimates of the total population size of M.challengeri vary depending on the methods used. Based on indirect measures, such as burrow counts, there may be as many as 28million individuals, and the annual catch might represent only 2%–4% of the total population. Using more reliable figures based on <b>those</b> <b>animals</b> seen during surveys, there may be only 2–11million individuals available to trawlers, and the annual catch may remove 12%–28% of that population. Bycatch from the New Zealand scampi fishery has included the New Zealand sea lion, Phocarctos hookeri, which is considered a vulnerable species by the IUCN.|$|E
5|$|Plague doctors traversed {{the streets}} {{diagnosing}} victims, {{although many of}} them had no formal medical training. Several public health efforts were attempted. Physicians were hired by city officials and burial details were carefully organized, but panic spread through the city and, out of the fear of contagion, people were hastily buried in overcrowded pits. The means of transmission of the disease were not known but thinking they might be linked to the animals, the City Corporation ordered a cull of dogs and cats. This decision may have affected the length of the epidemic since <b>those</b> <b>animals</b> could have helped keep in check the rat population carrying the fleas which transmitted the disease. Thinking bad air was involved in transmission, the authorities ordered giant bonfires to be burned in the streets and house fires to be kept burning night and day, in hopes that the air would be cleansed. Tobacco was thought to be a prophylactic and it was later said that no London tobacconist had died from the plague during the epidemic.|$|E

5|$|Witton {{elaborated}} in 2012 and 2013 on {{the idea}} that Istiodactylus was a scavenger. Scavenging birds have a mosaic of strong and weak elements in their skulls; {{they do not have to}} struggle with their prey, but need to be able to tear and pull morsels from cadavers. These birds also have relatively small eyes compared to predatory birds, as they do not need to search for hiding animals, or to make carefully judged attacks on their prey. Istiodactylus appears to have had large jaw muscles, and therefore a strong bite, and the skull was deep, which would have helped resist bending when pulling flesh. Individual bones of the skull were instead slender and shallow, and the toothrows were short, which indicates Istiodactylus did not have the necessary reinforcements for predation, and did not have to subdue struggling prey. Together, these features indicate Istiodactylus fed on large prey that necessitated strong jaws for processing, yet was also motionless enough so that strain on the jaws and skull could be controlled during feeding. The eyes of Istiodactylus also seem to have been proportionally small, compared to pterosaurs that are presumed to have been predatory (such as ornithocheirids). Witton concluded that among pterosaurs, Istiodactylus appears to have been the best-adapted for a scavenging lifestyle. He envisioned that istiodactylids would have to step back from a carcass if more powerful carnivores were attracted to it, but would return to finish the remains when <b>those</b> <b>animals</b> were satiated.|$|E

30|$|Studies in {{suckling}} rodent pups showed severe bodily disturbances {{and marked}} obesity after sc injection or oral administration of MSG, some of <b>those</b> <b>animal</b> models presented fasting hyperinsulinemia, hyperleptinemia, adiposity and increase of plasma fatty acids and triacylglycerols (Seiva et al., 2012). The administration of MSG to newborn rats results in distinctive lesions in hypothalamic arcuate nucleus neurons. The neuronal loss impairs insulin and leptin signaling and impacts energy balance {{as well as}} pituitary and adrenal activity (Yin et al., 2013).These effects are mostly attributed to immaturity of blood brain barrier in <b>those</b> young <b>animals</b> (Boonnate et al., 2015).|$|R
5000|$|In {{the animal}} kingdom there also exists a non-pathological form of osteosclerosis, {{resulting}} in unusually solid bone structure with little to no marrow. It is often seen in aquatic vertebrates, especially those living in shallow waters, providing ballast as an adaptation for an aquatic lifestyle. It makes bones heavier, but also more fragile. In <b>those</b> <b>animal</b> groups osteosclerosis often occurs together with bone thickening (pachyostosis). This joint occurrence is called pachyosteosclerosis.|$|R

25|$|The {{distinction}} between germline and somatic mutations {{is important in}} animals that have a dedicated germline to produce reproductive cells. However, it is of little value in understanding the effects of mutations in plants, which lack dedicated germline. The distinction is also blurred in <b>those</b> <b>animals</b> that reproduce asexually through mechanisms such as budding, because the cells {{that give rise to}} the daughter organisms also give rise to that organism's germline.|$|E
25|$|According to the naturalistic view, the flourishing {{of society}} is not, {{or not the}} only, {{intrinsically}} good thing. Defenses of this notion are often formulated by reference to biology, and observations that living things compete more with their own kind than with other kinds. Rather, what is of intrinsic good is the flourishing of all sentient life, extending to <b>those</b> <b>animals</b> that have some level of similar sentience, such as Great Ape personhood.

25|$|Of note is {{that the}} {{trotting}} bloodlines of the Standardbred, though distinct from the pacing bloodlines, also are homozygous for the DMRT3 mutation, suggesting that it not only affects lateral gaits, but inhibits {{the transition to a}} gallop. In the studies of Icelandic horses, <b>those</b> <b>animals</b> homozygous for the DMRT3 mutation scored poorly for their ability to both trot and gallop. Researchers concluded that breeders selected away from the mutation in horses bred for sports such as dressage, show jumping, and racing at a gallop.|$|E
25|$|However {{recent studies}} of {{starling}} flocks have shown that each bird modifies its position, relative to the six or seven animals directly surrounding it, no matter how close or how far away <b>those</b> <b>animals</b> are. Interactions between flocking starlings are thus based on a topological rule rather than a metric rule. It {{remains to be seen}} whether this applies to other animals. Another recent study, based on an analysis of high speed camera footage of flocks above Rome and assuming minimal behavioural rules, has convincingly simulated a number of aspects of flock behaviour.|$|E
25|$|For one thing, {{we would}} no longer allow breeding. People could not create {{different}} breeds. There would be no pet shops.

You would have a protective relationship with them just as you would with an orphaned child. But as the surplus of cats and dogs (artificially engineered by centuries of forced breeding) declined, eventually companion animals would be phased out, and we would return to a more symbiotic relationship—enjoyment at a distance.|$|E

5000|$|Myrmecophagy is {{a feeding}} {{behavior}} {{defined by the}} consumption of termites or ants, particularly as pertaining to <b>those</b> <b>animal</b> species whose diets are largely or exclusively composed of said insect types. Literally, myrmecophagy means [...] "ant eating" [...] (Ancient Greek: murmēx, [...] "ants" [...] and phagein, [...] "to eat") rather than [...] "termite eating" [...] (for which the strict term is termitophagy). However, the two habits often overlap, as both of these eusocial insect types often live in large, densely populated nests requiring similar adaptations in the animal species that exploit them.|$|R
25|$|When {{people choose}} to do things about which they are {{ambivalent}} and which they would have difficulty justifying, they experience a state of cognitive dissonance, {{which can lead to}} rationalization, denial, or even self-deception. For example, a 2011 experiment found that, when the harm that their meat-eating causes animals is explicitly brought to people's attention, they tend to rate <b>those</b> <b>animals</b> as possessing fewer mental capacities compared to when the harm is not brought to their attention. This is especially evident when people expect to eat meat in the near future. Such denial makes it less uncomfortable for people to eat animals. The data suggest that people who consume meat {{go to great lengths to}} try to resolve these moral inconsistencies between their beliefs and behaviour by adjusting their beliefs about what animals are capable of feeling. Ethical vegetarians argue that it is behaviour rather than supporting beliefs that should be adjusted.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no known}} {{antiviral}} treatment, but natural {{recovery from the}} virus is possible with supportive treatment. Patients with suspected hantavirus are usually {{admitted to the hospital}} and given oxygen and mechanical ventilation support to help them breathe during the acute pulmonary stage. However, if the infected individual is recognized early and receive medical care in an intensive care unit {{they are more likely to}} be better off because the infected individual is also given oxygen therapy to help them through severe respiratory distress. Another treatment option is immunotherapy. Immunotherapy, treatment of diseases with substances that stimulate the immune response, for this virus has shown that administration of human neutralizing antibodies during acute phases of Hantavirus might prove effective. A strong neutralizing antibody could effectively reduce the presence of the virus as well as promote recovery. However, no published reports of controlled clinical trials except for studies done on mice, hamsters, and rats have been shown. Although, those trials have been successful in protecting <b>those</b> <b>animals</b> from the virus.|$|E
25|$|Inuit {{actually}} {{consume more}} carbohydrates than most nutritionists have assumed. Because {{some of the}} meat the Inuit eat is raw and fresh, or freshly frozen, they can obtain more carbohydrates from their meat, as dietary glycogen, than Westerners can. The Inuit practice of preserving a whole seal or bird carcass under an intact whole skin with {{a thick layer of}} blubber also permits some proteins to ferment, or hydrolyze, into carbohydrates. Furthermore, the blubber, organs, muscle and skin of the marine mammals that Inuit eat have significant glycogen stores, which assist <b>those</b> <b>animals</b> when oxygen is depleted on prolonged dives. For instance, when blubber is analyzed by direct carbohydrate measurements, it has been shown to contain as much as 8—30% carbohydrates. While postmortem glycogen levels are often depleted through the onset of rigor mortis, marine mammals have a much delayed onset of rigor mortis, even in warm conditions, presumably due to the high content of oxymyoglobin in the muscle that may permit aerobic metabolism to continue slowly for some time after the death of the animal. Additionally, in cold conditions, glycogen's depletion is halted at -18°C (-0.4°F) and lower temperatures in comminuted meat.|$|E
