Leech overtook the United States' Joan Rosazza in the final 25 metres to take bronze in 1 minute 5.1 seconds. The race for third place had been <b>tight,</b> <b>with</b> just 0.7 of a second separating Leech and the final finisher. The youngest swimmer in the field, Leech had come through to claim the last podium position. Leech said that it was an emotional occasion, having seen the Australian men take a trifecta in the corresponding event on the previous night of racing.|$|E
5|$|Beginning the mission's fourth spacewalk at 13:45 UTC, Massimino and Good {{went to work}} {{repairing}} the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The spectrograph failed in 2004 due to a blown power supply. As with the ACS, the STIS was not designed {{with the intention of}} servicing it while in space, and one of the major challenges was to remove a cover plate held <b>tight</b> <b>with</b> over 100 screws using a specially designed tool called a fastener-capture plate, designed to trap the screws and washers and prevent them from floating into space when removed. While preparing the fastener-capture plate, Massimino encountered issues with a handrail that had to be removed to accommodate the fastener-capture plate. The handrail had a stripped bolt on the bottom, preventing it from being released. After trying multiple options without success, managers on the ground advised Massimino to use brute force to remove the handrail, so he could proceed with the removal of the cover plate. The procedure was tested at Goddard Space Flight Center prior to approving it, showing that the stripped bolt could be broken off safely using force. Working inside the orbiter, Feustel walked Massimino through the procedure slowly, advising him to tape the handrail with Kapton tape to prevent any parts from breaking off or flying loose, {{to be aware of the}} reaction the force would have, as well as to watch for sharp edges on the handrail after removal.|$|E

25|$|After {{the third}} Test, the return match with Yorkshire was very <b>tight,</b> <b>with</b> the county left to score 169 in 100 minutes and hanging on 61 short {{with the last}} {{available}} batsmen together when time ran out. The second match with Glamorgan was badly affected by rain with the New Zealanders in a commanding position, thanks to a big century by Wallace and six wickets for Cresswell. Games with Warwickshire, Nottinghamshire and Essex all ended in batsman-dominated draws. In the Essex game, Sutcliffe scored 243 in the first innings and an unbeaten 100 in the second innings, {{the first time a}} New Zealander had scored two hundreds in a match outside New Zealand.|$|E

25|$|Tsonga, {{again as}} a top seed, played at the 2011 China Open {{for the first time}} since 2007. He opened with wins over Grigor Dimitrov, Zhang Ze, and Juan Carlos Ferrero. As expected, his semifinals match against Tomáš Berdych was {{extremely}} difficult. Berdych took the first set and Tsonga the second, but Tsonga could not withstand Berdych's growing confidence in a three-set loss. Tsonga was fourth seed for the 2011 Shanghai Rolex Masters. Tsonga lost his first match to Kei Nishikori. Vienna was the next destination for Tsonga in the 2011 Erste Bank Open. Victories over Jarkko Nieminen, Xavier Malisse, and Daniel Brands set up a final against Juan Martín del Potro. The first set was <b>tight</b> <b>with</b> del Potro taking it in a tie-break, but Tsonga prevailed in sets two and three for his second title of the season.|$|E
25|$|Only {{the game}} for the second {{consecutive}} bronze remained for the Lithuanian squad, against the Australians who sought their first Olympic medal. Lithuanians were exhausted after the tedious semi-final, and the game remained <b>tight,</b> <b>with</b> the lead never getting over 8 points and the score at 73–72 with one minute remaining. Still, a three-point shot by Arvydas Sabonis with 30 seconds remaining helped Lithuania retain advantage, eventually triumphing 84–74. Sabonis was the driving force of the bronze medal game, neutralizing defender Mark Bradtke on the way to 30 points, 13 rebounds, 3 assists and 5 blocks. Another Olympic medal proved Lithuania was among the top basketball countries. The game marked the last time Sabonis and Marčiulionis played together, as the latter retired from the national team, and also the final match with head coach Vladas Garastas. A generational change was to come.|$|E
25|$|The {{cheese is}} put into a {{stainless}} steel, round form that is pulled <b>tight</b> <b>with</b> a spring-powered buckle so the cheese retains its wheel shape. After a day or two, the buckle is released and a plastic belt imprinted numerous times with the Parmigiano-Reggiano name, the plant's number, and month and year of production is put around the cheese and the metal form is buckled tight again. The imprints take hold on the rind of the cheese in about a day and the wheel is then put into a brine bath to absorb salt for 20–25 days. After brining, the wheels are then transferred to the aging rooms in the plant for 12 months. Each cheese is placed on wooden shelves that can be 24 cheeses high by 90 cheeses long or 2160 total wheels per aisle. Each cheese and the shelf underneath it is then cleaned manually or robotically every seven days. The cheese is also turned at this time.|$|E

25|$|The {{first half}} of the {{national}} championship game was tightly contested, with neither team leading by more than six points. At halftime, the score was tied at 31. Wisconsin scored first in the second half, and slowly built the lead as high as nine points. However, Duke fought back, and tied the score at 54 with 7 minutes to go. Duke took the lead {{for the first time in}} the second half with 5:30 remaining, but the game remained <b>tight.</b> <b>With</b> 3:30 remaining, Duke held a one-point lead, when Jahlil Okafor re-entered the game after sitting most of the second half in foul trouble. He scored on back to back possessions, giving Duke a 63–58 lead. After that, the closest Wisconsin got was 66–63 with 45 seconds left. Duke hit two foul shots and Wisconsin did not score again for a 68–63 final margin. The win gave Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski his fifth title, putting him in second place all-time for Division I Men's Basketball Titles.|$|E
25|$|On {{his return}} to Britain, Todd rejoined Blackheath, and was still a club member when four years later he was capped by his country {{as part of the}} 1900 Home Nations Championship. In the opening match of the tournament against Wales, the English {{selectors}} had gambled on 13 new caps, and lost the game. In the second game of the series, played against Ireland at the Athletic Ground in Richmond, Todd was given his chance, and he was brought into a more stable side than the previous match. England won 15-4. Todd was then reselected for the final game of the Championship, an away encounter with Scotland. The game was extremely <b>tight,</b> <b>with</b> the English halves reluctant to bring the backs into play, and the game ended in a 0-0 draw. As Scotland were the holders of the Calcutta Cup, the draw meant they retained the trophy, and England finished second in the Championship behind Wales. Todd was not reselected the next season and never represented his country in rugby again.|$|E
25|$|The Wuxi Classic was Fu's first ranking {{event of}} the 2013/2014 season, with him losing 4–5 to Mark King in the second round. He then played in the Australian Goldfields Open and enjoyed {{comfortable}} victories over Ken Doherty (5–2), Shaun Murphy (5–2) and Dominic Dale (5–1). In the semi-finals he built a 4–1 lead over Robert Milkins and held his nerve when the Englishman levelled at 4–4 to triumph 6–4. Fu faced home favourite and world number one Neil Robertson in the final, defeating him 9–6 to take the second ranking event title of his career and regain {{his place in the}} top 16 of the world rankings. Another final followed at the minor-ranking Bluebell Wood Open, with Fu fighting back from 1–3 down against Ricky Walden to square the match at 3–3 and was unfortunate in the decider when Walden fluked a red, before making a match winning clearance. Fu then lost {{in the second round of}} both the Shanghai Masters and the Indian Open 5–3 to Kyren Wilson and 4–3 to Gary Wilson respectively. He advanced to the quarter-finals of the International Championship in Chengdu, China, where he played Mark Selby. Fu came back from 5–3 down to take the match 6–5 with consecutive breaks of 84 and 112 in the final frame. His semi-final match against Joe Perry was very <b>tight</b> <b>with</b> many frames lasting 40 minutes, but it was Fu who won 9–8 on the colours to reach his third ranking event final of 2013. In a third successive final featuring two Asian players Fu won an hour long frame to hold a 9–8 advantage over his opponent Ding Junhui but went on to lose 10–9 without getting one clear chance to take the title. Fu rose to a career-high ranking of world number six after the event.|$|E

500|$|Despite Alcatraz being {{designed}} {{to house the}} [...] "worst of the worst" [...] of criminals who caused problems at other prisons, under the guidelines and regulations set by the strict prison administrators, courts could not direct a prisoner to be directly sent to Alcatraz, however notorious they were for misbehavior and attempted escape from other prisons. Prisoners entering Alcatraz would undergo vigorous research and assessments prior to their arrival. Security in the prison was very <b>tight,</b> <b>with</b> the constant checking of bars, doors, locks, electrical fixtures, and other areas to ensure that security hadn't been broken. During a standard day the prisoners would be counted 13 times, and the ratio of prisoners to guards was the lowest of any American prison of the time. The front door was made of solid steel, virtually impossible for any prisoners to escape through. The island had many guard towers, most of which have since been demolished, which were heavily guarded at various points in the day at times when security may have been breached; for instance, there were guard towers {{on each of the}} industry buildings to ensure that inmates didn't attempt to escape during the work day shifts. The recreation yard {{and other parts of the}} prison had a 25-foot fence around it topped with barbed wire, should any inmates attempt to escape during exercise.
