2500|$|Desmopressin will be {{ineffective}} in nephrogenic DI which is treated by reversing {{the underlying cause}} (if possible) and replacing the free water deficit. The diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (a <b>thiazide</b> <b>diuretic)</b> or indomethacin {{can be used to}} create mild hypovolemia which encourages salt and water uptake in proximal tubule and thus improve nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Amiloride has additional benefit of blocking Na uptake. Thiazide diuretics are sometimes combined with amiloride to prevent hypokalemia. It seems paradoxical to treat an extreme diuresis with a diuretic, and the exact mechanism of action is unknown but the thiazide diuretics will decrease distal convoluted tubule reabsorption of sodium and water, thereby causing diuresis. [...] This decreases plasma volume, thus lowering the glomerular filtration rate and enhancing the absorption of sodium and water in the proximal nephron. [...] Less fluid reaches the distal nephron, so overall fluid conservation is obtained.|$|E
50|$|By {{inhibiting}} the transporter, <b>thiazide</b> <b>diuretics</b> {{increase the}} gradient potential for Na. This increases {{the activity of}} the basolateral Na/Ca antiport and causes the increase in calcium reclamation associated with <b>thiazide</b> <b>diuretics.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Thiazide</b> <b>diuretics</b> cause {{changes in}} calcium metabolism. Clinically, these changes include a {{decreased}} excretion of calcium, {{and in some}} instances, {{this results in a}} corresponding increase in bone mineral. The study of mineral metabolism in bone is difficult because of the slow turnover rate of bone. For this reason, the rat fracture model was used to study bone mineral metabolism in animals given <b>thiazide</b> <b>diuretics.</b> Fifty rats were divided into four groups: group 1 received a fracture of the right tibia and <b>thiazide</b> <b>diuretics,</b> group 2 received thiazide and no fracture, group 3 received no drugs and a fracture, and group 4 received no drugs and no fracture. At the end of 35 days postinjury, all animals were sacrificed. Biochemical and biomechanical results were analyzed, and revealed that animals that received <b>thiazide</b> <b>diuretics</b> and a fracture had the highest bone mineral content...|$|R

40|$|<b>Thiazide</b> <b>diuretics</b> {{were the}} first tolerated {{efficient}} antihypertensive drugs that significantly reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in placebo-controlled clinical studies. Although these drugs today still are considered a fundamental therapeutic tool {{for the treatment of}} hypertensive patients, the following considerations should be taken into account. Although there are some indications that chlorthalidone can offer additional advantages as compared with other compounds, a recent meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials suggested that the beneficial effects of <b>thiazide</b> <b>diuretics</b> could be a class effect. <b>Thiazide</b> <b>diuretics</b> must be used at appropriate and/or optimal doses to achieve the optimal antihypertensive effect with the smallest occurrence of side effects, including alterations in glucose and lipid profiles and hypokalemia. Moreover, because <b>thiazide</b> <b>diuretics</b> can increase the incidence of new-onset diabetes, especially when combined with beta blockers, caution is advised in using these drugs above all in patients who are at high risk for developing diabetes, in whom <b>thiazide</b> <b>diuretics</b> should be used at the lowest active dose and possibly in combination with drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system. Finally, the current debate on whether <b>thiazide</b> <b>diuretics</b> are the first-choice drug for most patients with uncomplicated hypertension, as stated in the Seventh Joint National Committee Report, or are included in the major classes of antihypertensive agents that are suitable for initiation and maintenance of therapy, as reported in the European Society of Hypertension-European Society of Cardiology Guidelines, derives from different interpretations of controlled clinical trial data on drug class comparison and of cost-benefit analyses. However, considering that the benefit of antihypertensive drugs seems to be due principally to BP lowering per se without definitive evidence of the superiority of a particular drug class and that there is no cost-benefit analysis showing the superiority of <b>thiazide</b> <b>diuretics,</b> it is believed that these drugs should not be considered as the only first-choice drug but included among first-choice drugs...|$|R

25|$|Since <b>thiazide</b> <b>diuretics</b> {{affect the}} {{transport}} of electrolytes and water in the kidney, they can be responsible for abnormalities of water balance and electrolyte levels. Removal of too much fluid can cause volume depletion and hypotension. Various electrolyte abnormalities may result, including hyponatremia (low sodium), hypokalemia (low potassium), hypochloremia (low chloride), hypomagnesemia (low magnesium), hypercalcemia (high calcium), and hyperuricemia (high uric acid). These may result in dizziness, headache, or heart arrhythmias (palpitations). Serious, though rare, side effects include aplastic anemia, pancreatitis, agranulocytosis, and angioedema. Metolazone, like other <b>thiazide</b> <b>diuretics,</b> may unmask latent diabetes mellitus or exacerbate gout, especially by interacting with medicines used to treat gout. In addition, <b>thiazide</b> <b>diuretics,</b> including metolazone, are sulfonamides; those with hypersensitivity to sulfonamides ("sulfa allergy") may also be allergic to metolazone.|$|R
