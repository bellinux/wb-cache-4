5|$|Bregowine died in 764 and was {{originally}} {{buried in the}} baptistry in Canterbury, but his remains were moved to the choir of Canterbury Cathedral in 1123. This followed an attempt in around 1121 <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>his</b> remains to another monastery, which came to nothing. The remains were placed by the altar of St Gregory in the south transept, after having been briefly placed in the north transept. Bregowine was later considered a saint, with a feast day of 26August, although Florence of Worcester, a 12th-century writer, recorded his death date as 24August. Other sources record the death date as 25August. His life was later written by Eadmer in the 12thcentury.|$|E

50|$|In November 2012, Hu Jintao {{retired as}} General Secretary and was succeeded by Xi Jinping, the nation's first {{paramount}} leader {{to be born}} after {{the foundation of the}} PRC. Xi initiated a series of large-scale anti-corruption drives, which however are believed to be secondary <b>to</b> <b>removing</b> <b>his</b> political opponents in the party, especially allies of Jiang Zemin's two sons. Jiang himself, despite being retired since 2004, is believed to still be manipulating politics behind the scenes.|$|R
5|$|On 5 September 2007, Chris Taylor, {{mounted on}} a {{pantomime}} horse, confronted police officers, who were on foot, and {{asked them if they}} needed any reinforcements against APEC protesters. When his offer was refused, Taylor took the horse for a stroll anyway, and was met by amused onlookers and media personnel. He was later asked by police officers <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>his</b> clothing for examination, since it resembled a police uniform; but no charges of impersonating police were laid. The reference was to the horse flu outbreak, which forced police officers to face APEC protesters on foot. This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode.|$|E
5|$|On May 12, 1995 Tkach {{had surgery}} <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>his</b> gall bladder. Shortly thereafter, he was readmitted to the {{hospital}} because of severe intestine and back pain.

As Armstrong had done before him, Tkach named a successor to become pastor general in the event of his death. In that case, it was Tkach's son, Joseph Tkach Jr.|$|E

During the battle the Dutch frigate Maria Riggersbergen was left unsupported by the remainder of the squadron and, isolated, was forced to surrender. Captain Peter Rainier, the British commander, was subsequently free <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>his</b> prize from within sight of the Dutch port when the remainder of the Dutch squadron refused to engage Caroline and their crews deliberately grounded the ships to avoid capture. He also returned many prisoners taken previously in a captured brig.|$|E

Kanaan {{continued}} his good performance and recorded the fastest time with a lap of 59.869 seconds. Herta was second-fastest, and Fernández was third. Bräck and de Ferran rounded out the session's top five fastest drivers. Fernández locked his brakes {{and went into the}} turn five tire wall which stopped the session for three minutes to allow course officials <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>his</b> car from the barrier, and Franchitti and Junqueira made contact at the pit lane entrance but both drivers continued without any apparent damage.|$|E
5|$|Welensky {{considered}} a federal unilateral {{declaration of independence}} when the new Northern Rhodesian constitution appeared likely to grant an African majority in its parliament. Determined at one point to prevent changes, Welensky was convinced that if he refused, the British would use military force <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>his</b> government. Believing that preparations were being made for an invasion from Kenya, he discussed the federation's ability to repel an attack with his defence chiefs and plans were set in motion. In the end, {{the idea of a}} British invasion was one of many options considered, and did not make it past cabinet discussion.|$|E

5|$|A {{short time}} later, Luke escapes again by using string to shake a bush and {{distract}} the guards, visiting a nearby {{house where he}} uses an axe <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>his</b> shackles. To keep the guard dogs from following his scent, he spreads curry powder and chili powder across the ground to send them into sneezing fits and overload their sensitive sense of smell. While free, Luke mails Dragline a magazine that includes a photograph of him with two beautiful women. He is soon recaptured, beaten, returned to the prison camp, and fitted with two sets of leg irons. Luke is warned by the Captain that if he ever attempts to escape again, he will be killed on the spot. Luke is now annoyed by the other prisoners fawning over the magazine photo and reveals {{it to be a}} fake. At first, the other prisoners are angry, but after a long stay in the box, when Luke is forced to eat a huge serving of rice, they come to help him finish it.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in medias res, while Piz (Chris Lowell) and Mac (Tina Majorino) {{are at a}} party, a bloodied Veronica stumbles to Piz’s {{door and}} collapses. The episode flashes back to two days earlier. As the Lilith House celebrates {{the end of the}} Greek system, Logan (Jason Dohring) {{abruptly}} breaks up with Veronica. Weevil helps Dean O’Dell (Ed Begley, Jr.) fix his TV. A man comes into the Dean’s office and implicitly threatens <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>his</b> funding if the Greek system stays closed.

5|$|Elgar's statue {{at the end}} of Worcester High Street stands {{facing the}} cathedral, only yards from where his father's shop once stood. Another statue of the {{composer}} by Rose Garrard {{is at the top of}} Church Street in Malvern, overlooking the town and giving visitors an opportunity to stand next to the composer in the shadow of the Hills that he so often regarded. In September 2005, a third statue sculpted by Jemma Pearson was unveiled near Hereford Cathedral in honour of his many musical and other associations with the city. It depicts Elgar with his bicycle. From 1999 until early 2007, new Bank of England twenty pound notes featured a portrait of Elgar. The change <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>his</b> image generated controversy, particularly because 2007 was the 150th anniversary of Elgar's birth. From 2007 the Elgar notes were phased out, ceasing to be legal tender on 30 June 2010.|$|E

5|$|Immediately upon {{arriving}} in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination {{because of his}} skin colour and heritage, like all people of colour. He {{was not allowed to}} sit with European passengers in the stagecoach and told to sit on the floor near the driver, then beaten when he refused; elsewhere he was kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown off a train at Pietermaritzburg after refusing to leave the first-class. He sat in the train station, shivering all night and pondering if he should return to India or protest for his rights. He chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the next day. In another incident, the magistrate of a Durban court ordered Gandhi <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>his</b> turban, which he refused to do. Indians were not allowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa. Gandhi was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning.|$|E
5|$|In 1929–30, ill-health {{restricted}} Jackson to {{just five}} first-class matches and five innings for Balmain. Despite his health, Jackson {{had a successful}} season, and scored 168 not out against Arthur Gilligan's English team, which toured Australia briefly en route to New Zealand. He {{was seen as an}} automatic selection for the 1930 Ashes tour of England. He confirmed his selection with 182 in a Test trial, an innings regarded by many as the best he had ever played. Another scare with illness saw him hospitalised in Adelaide after the Christmas match against South Australia, missing the next two state matches. His health problems continued after an operation <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>his</b> tonsils; a procedure that was arranged by the Australian Board of Control despite Jackson never having previously suffered any problems with his tonsils. Bill Ponsford had suffered from tonsillitis during the previous tour and the Board were anxious to avoid similar occurrences. Complications resulting from the operation saw Jackson lose a stone (6.4 kilograms) in weight.|$|E

Prior to the performance he had only managed to spend 12 consecutive hours in the water. He fasted for 24 hours before the performance {{to make it through the}} period without need to exit and use the washroom. During the trick he went through 16 oxygen tanks. After the trick he was required <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>his</b> own shackles and chains before exiting the water. Within an hour, his skin began to react substantially to the water.|$|E
