5000|$|In October 2003 Reveo and the Government of Malaysia {{started a}} {{research}} and development centre named InventQjaya; {{the goal of the}} government was to achieve <b>technological</b> <b>sovereignty</b> by 2020. [...] The arrangements were based on Faris' relationship with Mahathir Mohamad, who was then the prime minister. [...] The center was set up a wholly owned subsidiary of Reveo and was funded by the government; the government committed to a total of RM437mil in funding and had made RM228mil available as of February 2005, when the government froze the accounts of InventQjaya. [...] The accounts were frozen based on allegations made by the Malayasian independent directors who had been appointed to the board of InventQjaya that Faris' claims about the technology he wanted to commercialize through InventQjaya might be fraudulent, as well as claims by InventQjaya's recently fired chief financial officer that RM50mil in funds had been inappropriately transferred to Reveo. [...] The seizure order was lifted in January 2006.|$|E

5000|$|A Ukrainian {{professor}} of International Law, Alexander Merezhko, {{has developed a}} project called the International Convention on Prohibition of Cyberwar in Internet. According to this project, cyberwar {{is defined as the}} use of Internet and related technological means by one state against the political, economic, <b>technological</b> and information <b>sovereignty</b> and independence of another state. Professor Merezhko's project suggests that the Internet ought to remain free from warfare tactics and be treated as an international landmark. He states that the Internet (cyberspace) is a [...] "common heritage of mankind".|$|R
40|$|This paper problematizes meanings, {{governance}} implications, and metro-political shortcomings {{given the}} evolution of some smart city transitional cases in Europe. As such, current smart city projects in Europe are depicting rather complex urbanity regarding the techno-politics of data, pervasive multi-stakeholder regional configurations, and unlike one-size-fits-all extensions/replications from the metropolitan to the city-regional scale. Ongoing reforms of administrative borders and competences of local governments are increasingly leading to a trend that this paper summarizes as ‘smart devolution’. This paper will thus suggest a conceptual framework encompassing six dimensions to politicize smartness in cities and regions by blending governance with technological and territorial issues {{that sooner or later}} will require context-based and ad-hoc smart city-regional strategies stemming from <b>technological</b> <b>sovereignty,</b> data ownership, and city-regional self-government policies. Ultimately, this paper will present some evidence-based findings from ethnographic and strategic fieldwork research conducted from September 2015 to June 2016 in Glasgow, Bristol, Barcelona, and Bilbao...|$|E
40|$|After {{showing the}} dynamic {{character}} of the world market of telecommunications equipment, the authors analyze the main factors which {{have contributed to the}} elaboration of the industrial structure in this field. Particular stress is laid on the role played by technological evolution as driving force of the industrial reorganization which is taking place right now in the field. This reorganization movement on a world scale has sometimes given rise, in industrial policy, to totally different behaviours from governments. Thus, the strategies of the Japanese and French branches are countered by measures taken by the US Government to deregulate and liberalize the market. The authors conclude by pointing out that, given the limited means at its disposal and faced with an international market of electronics threatened by competition from the Newly Industrialized Countries, {{there is a need for}} Canada to adopt a differential strategic approach which will allow it to acceed to <b>technological</b> <b>sovereignty</b> and to counter the delocalisation process which profit the NIC of South-East Asia...|$|E
40|$|The {{article focuses}} {{on the problem of}} import substitution in the field of IT-technologies, in particular, the practice of visual {{modeling}} in the process of designing the objects of architecture and design. The author presents the idea of creating national multifunctional software complex for visual modeling as a topical alternative to foreign analogues. The topicality of the ideas is determined by several factors: the increased risks for the <b>technological</b> <b>sovereignty</b> of the country, the need to optimize the practice of designing the objects of architecture and design, rapid development of domestic industry of IT-technologies.  The article describes in detail the proposal for the creation of software based on the latest IT- technologies, maximum optimized in terms of interoperability through its constituent units, taking into consideration the eculiarities of mentality and language culture and traditions of local users and the specifics of the algorithms of design process. The idea set forth in the article aims to familiarize practitioners of design and architecture with options for addressing the urgent, in the author‟s opinion, complex problem in the field of digital modeling in various areas of design practice and information exchange. The author‟s suggestions are based on his own practical experience of project modeling and teaching professional designers. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective {{to analyze}} the contradictions of {{international}} industrial cooperation as a driving force for its development. 	Methods identification and analysis of contradictions in international cooperation were carried out using systematic approach based on general scientific methods of theoretical and empirical research analysis synthesis scientific observation measurement and comparison. On the basis of generalization {{and analysis of the}} information contained in the statistical system of the Organization {{for economic cooperation and development}} and the global competitiveness reports of the world economic forum the author presents assessment of the level of technological and knowledgeintensity of the economies of certain developed and developing transition countries investment efficiency in science and research their influence on the technological level of production and the degree of <b>technological</b> <b>sovereignty</b> of the mentioned countries. 	Results the study of the industrialized countriesrsquo experience has shown that the production of hightech products is impossible without integration into a global cooperative network of industrial companies and research institutes. However being included into the global production chains and attracting advanced technologies of production marketing and management the national companies inevitably fall into dependence on foreign import supply. 	An economic axiom is formulated modern hightech production requires a dramatic expansion of international production cooperation. 	The main ontological contradiction of international industrial cooperation is revealed characterized by the impact on the improvement of the technological level of production and innovativeness of the national economy on the one hand and simultaneous strengthening of its dependence on foreign partners on the other hand. 	Scientific novelty on the basis of systematic approach the article reveals contradictions in international cooperation in the context of innovative development and economic security of the country the basic contradiction of international industrial cooperation is formulated it is proved that the resolutionmitigation of the main contradiction is due to the development of the national innovation system. 	Practical significance the main provisions and conclusions of the article can be used in the development of recommendations to reduce the level of contradictions in international cooperation and to weaken the dependence of the Russian industry from imports. 	nbs...|$|E
