5|$|Like other hadrosaurids, it {{was able}} to walk on either two legs or four. It {{probably}} preferred <b>to</b> <b>forage</b> for food on four legs, but ran on two. The neural spines of the vertebrae were tall, as was common in lambeosaurines; tallest over the hips, they increased the height of the back. Skin impressions are known for P. walkeri, showing uniform tubercle-like scales but no larger structures.|$|E
5|$|Males {{and females}} prefer {{different}} foraging sites. While males usually hover among the higher shrub foliage between , females tend <b>to</b> <b>forage</b> at lower strata.

40|$|Honey bees exhibit an age-related {{division}} of labor (Robinson, 2002). Bees perform several different behaviors in the hive during the first 2 – 3 ·weeks of adult life, including brood care (‘nursing’), and then shift <b>to</b> <b>foraging</b> mostly for nectar and pollen outside the hive {{for the remainder of}} their 5 – 7 -week life. Like other forms of behavioral maturation such as social dominance and sexual behavior in vertebrates (Becker et al., 1992), the regulation of the transition from working in the hive <b>to</b> <b>foraging</b> in honey bees involves changes in brain chemistry, brain structure, endocrine activity and gene expression (Robinson, 2002). The transition <b>to</b> <b>foraging</b> is also dependent on the environment and can be accelerated, delayed or even reversed depending on the needs of the colony (Robinson, 2002). Microarray analysis has revealed that many genes in the brain show changes in expression levels i...|$|R
5|$|Sarus cranes {{preferentially}} use wetlands or uncultivated patches amid flooded {{rice paddies}} (locally called khet-taavadi) for nesting in India. Breeding pairs are territorial and prefer <b>to</b> <b>forage</b> in natural wetlands, though wet crops like rice and wheat are also frequented.

5|$|The {{most common}} predators of greater noctule bat are barn owl (Tyto alba) and Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo). The greater noctule bat {{generally}} leaves its roost <b>to</b> <b>forage</b> {{after it is}} already completely dark outside, this coincides with the general time that the two mentioned owl species hunt. There is also some risk to the greater noctule from parasitism between bats.|$|E
5|$|The turtle starts its day at sunrise, {{emerging}} from the water to bask for several hours. Warmed for activity, it returns to the water <b>to</b> <b>forage.</b> After becoming chilled, the turtle re-emerges for one to two more cycles of basking and feeding. At night, the turtle drops {{to the bottom of}} its water body or perches on an underwater object and sleeps.|$|E
40|$|The honeybee, Apis mellifera, {{has been}} the most {{important}} insect species for the study of social behaviour. With the recent release of its genome sequence, the honeybee has emerged as an excellent model for molecular studies of social behaviour. A key feature of eusocial species is a complex division of labour. Adult honeybees perform a series of tasks in the hive when they are young and then shift <b>to</b> <b>foraging</b> for nectar or pollen outside the hive when they are 2 - 3 weeks of age. This transition from working in the hive <b>to</b> <b>foraging</b> involves changes in the expression of thousands of genes. In this review, we focus first on recent advances in understanding of the widespread changes in gene activity that accompany the transition <b>to</b> <b>foraging.</b> Thereafter, we examine three genes in particular, foraging, malvolio and vitellogenin, all implicated in this striking behavioural change {{in the life of the}} honeybee...|$|R

2500|$|The {{differences}} {{in a variety}} of behaviors between different species of honey bee are the result of a directional selection that acts upon several foraging behavior traits as a common entity. Selection in natural populations of honey bee show that positive selection of sensitivity to low concentrations of sucrose are linked <b>to</b> <b>foraging</b> at younger ages and collecting resources low in sucrose. Positive selection of sensitivity to high concentrations of sucrose were linked <b>to</b> <b>foraging</b> at older ages and collecting resources higher in sucrose. Additionally of interest, “change in one component of a suite of behaviors appear to direct change in the entire suite.” ...|$|R
5|$|Active-swimming predators, {{groups of}} leopard sharks often follow the tide onto {{intertidal}} mudflats <b>to</b> <b>forage</b> for food, mainly clams, spoon worms, crabs, shrimp, bony fish, and fish eggs. Most leopard sharks tend to remain {{within a particular}} area rather than undertaking long movements elsewhere, {{which has led to}} genetic divergence between populations of sharks living in different regions. This species is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the young hatch inside the uterus and are nourished by yolk. From March to June, the female gives birth to as many as 37 young after a gestation period of 10–12 months. It is relatively slow-growing and takes many years to mature.|$|E
5|$|During heavy rains, it {{was much}} more {{difficult}} to track insurgents by air, negating Portugal's air superiority, and Portuguese troops and vehicles found movement during rain storms difficult. In contrast, the insurgent troops, with lighter equipment, were able to flee into the bush (the mato) amongst an ethnically similar populace into which they could melt away. Furthermore, the FRELIMO forces were able <b>to</b> <b>forage</b> food from the surroundings and local villages, and were thus not hampered by long supply lines.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian {{vultures}} roost communally {{on large}} trees, buildings or on cliffs. Roost sites are usually chosen {{close to a}} dump site or other suitable foraging area. In Spain and Morocco, summer roosts are formed mainly by immature birds. The favourite roost trees tended to be large dead pines. The number of adults at the roost increases towards June. It is thought that breeding adults may be able <b>to</b> <b>forage</b> more efficiently by joining the roost and following others to the best feeding areas. Breeding birds that failed to raise young may also join the non-breeding birds at the roost during June.|$|E

5|$|Fork-marked lemurs are {{sensitive}} to light intensity, and emerge at twilight, calling numerous times and answering their neighbors' calls before going off <b>to</b> <b>forage.</b> Just before dawn, they also communicate again {{on their way to}} their sleep site. Cold temperatures can also cause individuals to retire to their sleeping site as early as two hours before dawn. Their eye shine creates a unique pattern among lemurs because they tend to bob their heads up and down and from side to side.|$|E

5|$|Honeyeaters prefer <b>to</b> <b>forage</b> at {{individual}} flowers which have only just opened, as these {{offer the most}} nectar. As they probe for nectar, honeyeaters end up with large quantities of pollen on their beaks, foreheads and throats, some of which they subsequently transfer to other flowers. This transfer is quite efficient: flowers typically lose nearly all their pollen within four hours of opening, and pollen is deposited on the majority of stigmata. Around 15% of these stigmata end up with pollen lodged in the stigmatic groove, a prerequisite to fertilisation.|$|E
5000|$|Banded killifish form group shoals. The {{conditions}} in which shoaling occurs, the individuals who comprise the shoal, {{and the size of}} the shoal are all highly variable. Shoaling can be understood through a cost and benefit analysis. The costs and benefits of group membership are influenced by food availability and predatory risk. There is a cost and benefit analysis when making groups. Bigger groups allow for better predatory protection, but are not as conducive <b>to</b> <b>foraging</b> because the food will be distributed amongst all of the group members. [...] For smaller groups, there is not as effective predatory protection, but in regards <b>to</b> <b>foraging</b> each individual will have access to more food.|$|R

No pochard has a metallic coloured speculum, something that is characteristic of other ducks.|$|R
5|$|Myrmecia nigrocincta, {{commonly}} known as the jumper ant or jumping jack, is an ant of the genus Myrmecia. The species was first described by Frederick Smith in 1858. Colonies of this ant are abundant in eastern Australia. Ants of this species are known for their ability to jump several inches, and they also have a powerful, venomous sting. Rather than foraging on the ground, M. nigrocincta prefer <b>to</b> <b>forage</b> in trees where they are known to pollinate certain flowers.|$|E
5|$|Pied currawongs are {{generally}} tree-dwelling, hunting and foraging some metres above the ground, and thus {{able to share}} territory with the ground-foraging Australian magpie. Birds roost in forested areas or large trees at night, disperse <b>to</b> <b>forage</b> {{in the early morning}} and return in the late afternoon. Although often solitary or encountered in small groups, the species may form larger flocks of fifty or more birds in autumn and winter. On the ground, a pied currawong hops or struts.|$|E
5|$|Some social wasps are omnivorous, {{feeding on}} fallen fruit, nectar, and carrion such as dead insects. Adult male wasps {{sometimes}} visit flowers to obtain nectar. Some wasps, such as Polistes fuscatus, commonly return to locations where they previously found prey <b>to</b> <b>forage.</b> In many social species, the larvae exude copious amounts of salivary secretions that are avidly {{consumed by the}} adults. These include both sugars and amino acids, and may provide essential protein-building nutrients that are otherwise unavailable to the adults (who cannot digest proteins).|$|E

50|$|The queen's {{primary role}} is to {{reproduce}} and ensure the colony has {{a steady supply of}} new workers. The worker bumblebees are responsible for most of the other chores, such as foraging, nest maintenance, and tending to the larvae. Younger workers typically start life as a worker where most of their time is devoted to working in the nest. Wax in bumblebees is secreted from the underside of the abdomen of the worker. An individual bumblebee's ability to produce wax starts at about the second day of adult life, but starts to decline after the first week. Since wax is only required within the nest, young workers are predisposed towards within-nest work such as nest maintenance. As bumblebees mature, {{they are more likely to}} switch over from within-nest duty <b>to</b> <b>foraging.</b> Furthermore, newer foragers generally collect nectar and tend to switch over to collecting pollen as they age. Long ago, foragers of a range of different bumblebee species were noticed to tend to be larger, on average, than bees that performed within-nest work. This trend can best be explained by the observation that larger-sized workers tend to switch from within-nest work <b>to</b> <b>foraging</b> earlier than smaller workers. The very smallest workers never switch <b>to</b> <b>foraging</b> and remain within-nest workers their entire lives.|$|R
