5|$|The book {{is divided}} into three parts: concealment, advertisement, and disguise. Part 1, concealment, covers <b>the</b> <b>methods</b> of camouflage, which are colour resemblance, countershading, {{disruptive}} coloration, and shadow elimination. The effectiveness of these, arguments for and against them, and experimental evidence, are described. Part 2, advertisement, covers <b>the</b> <b>methods</b> of becoming conspicuous, especially for warning displays in aposematic animals. Examples are chosen from mammals, insects, reptiles and marine animals, and empirical evidence from feeding experiments with toads is presented. Part 3, disguise, covers methods of mimicry that provide camouflage, as when animals resemble leaves or twigs, and markings and displays that help to deflect attack or to deceive predators with deimatic displays. Both Batesian mimicry and Müllerian mimicry are treated as adaptive resemblance, much like camouflage, while a chapter is devoted to the mimicry and behaviour of the cuckoo. The concluding chapter admits that the book's force is cumulative, consisting of many small steps of reasoning, and being a wartime book, compares animal to military camouflage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{discusses}} the features and applications of interface tracking techniques for modeling deroplet-based microfluidics. The paper reviews {{the state of}} <b>the</b> art of <b>methods</b> for tracking and capturing <b>the</b> interface. These <b>methods</b> are categorized as the implicit and <b>the</b> explicit <b>methods.</b> <b>The</b> implicit <b>methods</b> need to reconstruct the interface by reconnecting the markers on the interface. The implicit techniques implicitly describe the interface as a simple function. Thus, complicated topological changes of interface can be handled naturally and automatically. <b>The</b> implicit <b>methods</b> reviewed in this paper are <b>the</b> volume-of-fluid <b>method,</b> <b>the</b> phase-field <b>method,</b> <b>the</b> Lattice-Boltzmann <b>method</b> and <b>the</b> level-set <b>method.</b> <b>The</b> explicit <b>methods</b> mainly include <b>the</b> boundary-integral <b>methods</b> and <b>the</b> tracking <b>methods...</b>|$|R
