5|$|Throughout their career, the Grateful Dead {{were known}} to {{tolerate}} <b>taping</b> of the live shows. There was a demand from fans to hear the improvisations that resulted from each show, {{and the concept of}} <b>taping</b> shows appealed to the band's general community ethos. They were unique among bands in that their live shows tended not to be pressed and packaged as LPs, but remained in tape form to be shared between tapers. The group were strongly opposed to commercial bootlegging and policed stores that sold them, while the saturation of tapes among fans suppressed any demand for product. In 1985, the Dead, after years of tolerance, officially endorsed live <b>taping</b> of their shows, and set up dedicated areas that they believed gave the best sound recording quality. Other bands, including Pearl Jam, Phish and the Dave Matthews Band tolerate <b>taping</b> in a similar manner to the Dead, provided no profit is involved.
