5|$|The {{agreements}} to containerise Cunard's freight operations had returned the overall Cunard group to profitability, with the shipping line now profitable and the passenger ships losing money, {{a reversal of}} the situation Smallpeice had inherited in 1965. The company returned profits of £2 million in 1968 and £3 million in 1969 and <b>the</b> <b>share</b> <b>price</b> rose accordingly. The downturn in the economy and shipping industry in 1970 resulted in Cunard once again incurring a loss and a drop in <b>the</b> <b>share</b> <b>price,</b> resulting in the company becoming a takeover target.|$|E
5|$|To {{finance the}} scheme, Otto, Augustus and Charles Morse met with Charles T. Barney, {{president}} of the city's third-largest trust, the Knickerbocker Trust Company. Barney had provided financing for previous Morse schemes. Morse, however, cautioned Otto that he needed much more money than he had to attempt the squeeze and Barney declined to provide funding. Otto decided to attempt the corner anyway. On Monday, October 14, he began aggressively purchasing shares of United Copper, which rose in one day from $39 to $52 per share. On Tuesday (Oct. 15), he issued the call for short sellers to return the borrowed stock. <b>The</b> <b>share</b> <b>price</b> rose to nearly $60, but the short sellers {{were able to find}} plenty of United Copper shares from sources other than the Heinzes. Otto had misread the market, and <b>the</b> <b>share</b> <b>price</b> of United Copper began to collapse.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{issue of}} {{modelling}} and forecasting <b>the</b> <b>share</b> <b>prices</b> of <b>the</b> banking sector remains a challenge {{because of high}} volatilities in individual stock prices.

40|$|Previously, we have {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} a reliable linear dependence between <b>share</b> <b>prices</b> of energy-related companies and the difference between CPI and core CPI: any change in <b>share</b> <b>prices</b> is transmitted into a proportional change in this difference two and half months later. The difference itself is characterized by sustainable trends reigning over seven to twenty-year intervals. As a result, the link between <b>the</b> <b>share</b> <b>prices</b> and <b>the</b> difference allows predicting the former over longer intervals. Since mid- 2008, the previously observed trend has been undergoing a transition to a new trend. Accordingly, one may formulate two principal problems: “What is <b>the</b> dependence between <b>share</b> <b>price</b> and CPI during the transition? ” and “When and how can one determine the properties of the new trend? ” Currently available information on the CPI allows predicting <b>the</b> <b>share</b> <b>prices</b> between June and September 2009...|$|R
5|$|Augustus' brother, Otto, {{devised the}} scheme to corner United Copper, {{believing that the}} Heinze family already {{controlled}} {{a majority of the}} company. He also believed that a significant number of the Heinze's shares had been borrowed, and sold short, by speculators betting that the stock price would drop, and that they could thus repurchase the borrowed shares cheaply, pocketing the difference. Otto proposed a short squeeze, whereby the Heinzes would aggressively purchase as many remaining shares as possible, and then force the short sellers to pay for their borrowed shares. The aggressive purchasing would drive up <b>the</b> <b>share</b> <b>price,</b> and, being unable to find shares elsewhere, the short sellers would have no option but to turn to the Heinzes, who could then name their price.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, McDonald's made {{an initial}} {{minority}} {{investment in the}} company. By 2001, the company had grown to be Chipotle's largest investor. The investment from McDonald's allowed the firm to quickly expand, from 16 restaurants in 1998 to over 500 by 2005. On January 26, 2006, Chipotle made its initial public offering (IPO) after increasing <b>the</b> <b>share</b> <b>price</b> twice due to high pre-IPO demand. In its first day as a public company, the stock rose exactly 100%, resulting in the best U.S.-based IPO in six years, and the second-best IPO for a restaurant after Boston Market.

The price {{continued to be}} volatile: trading was halted as its price hit the upper limit for price falls. On 14 and 15 November, after the threat of delisting ebbed, trading in its shares was once again halted when buy orders heavily outnumbered sell orders; the price rose by the upper limit of ¥100. Trading only took place after hours as there was a glut of unsatisfied buy orders. <b>The</b> <b>share</b> <b>price</b> rose in four straight trading sessions, reaching 834yen at one point on 16 November.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of {{the opening}} of the IPO, {{concerns}} were raised among both investors and Manchester United supporters regarding the details of the share offering. Although the share prospectus specified that the proceeds from the sale would go towards paying down the club's debts, it was revealed that much of the money would go directly to the Glazers. Furthermore, holders of class A shares would not be entitled to a regular dividend, and the structure of the share issue meant that the Glazers' class B shares had 10 times the voting power of class A shares, essentially denying a controlling interest in the club to anyone but the Glazers. These issues drove down interest and forced a drop in <b>the</b> <b>share</b> <b>price</b> from the planned $16–20 each to $14 each, representing a potential total sale value of $233million (£150million).|$|E
5|$|A railway from Grantham to Sleaford {{opened in}} 1857. This was {{extended}} to Boston in 1859, and so offered direct competition to the navigation. The decline was rapid. Income fell from £981 in 1858 to £168 in 1868, and <b>the</b> <b>share</b> <b>price</b> dropped from £40 to £10 between 1860 and 1863.

The Act required the company to fill in the three locks nearest to Sleaford, but there were special provisions for the remaining structures. The next three were on a stretch of river bordered by land belonging to Haverholme Priory, and were to be put into good order and handed over to Murray Finch Hatton, earl of Winchilsea & Nottingham, who owned the Priory. He could then maintain or abandon them, but was required to construct sluices if he chose to abandon them. The final lock was to be handed over to the commissioners of the River Witham, once it was in good order, and they could remove the gates and fill in the lock if they chose to do so.|$|E

Nomura and JPMorgan announced on 20 October that their coverage of the company was halted.

25|$|A more {{accurate}} method of calculating this price {{is to look}} at <b>the</b> <b>share</b> <b>price</b> and dividend from the after-tax perspective of a share holder. The after-tax drop in <b>the</b> <b>share</b> <b>price</b> (or capital gain/loss) should be equivalent to the after-tax dividend. For example, if the tax of capital gains Tcg is 35%, and the tax on dividends Td is 15%, then a £1 dividend is equivalent to £0.85 of after-tax money. To get the same financial benefit from a capital loss, the after-tax capital loss value should equal £0.85. The pre-tax capital loss would be £0.85/(1-Tcg) = £0.85/(1-35%) = £0.85/65% = £1.30. In this case, a dividend of £1 has led to a larger drop in <b>the</b> <b>share</b> <b>price</b> of £1.30, because the tax rate on capital losses is higher than the dividend tax rate.|$|E

Most of the studies conducted in regards to the oil and gas sector takes into account the contributing factors such as the condition of oil futures in NYMEX and focuses on prominent oil exporting and importing countries. In contrast, this paper empirically assesses the dynamics of global, national and company level factors that could influence <b>the</b> <b>share</b> <b>prices</b> of oil and gas listed companies in Bursa Malaysia. This study employed time series and panel data analysis in analyzing Malaysia’s data within the daily duration of June 1 st, 2005 until May 29 th, 2009. The empirical results show that the global oil demand is positively associated to the oil price and that the oil price is positively related to the condition of oil futures traded in Bursa Derivatives. Furthermore, the global oil demand, Bursa Derivatives oil futures, earnings per <b>share</b> and <b>price</b> to book are positively associated while the price to earnings ratio is negatively associated to <b>the</b> <b>share</b> <b>prices</b> of oil and gas companies listed in Bursa Malaysia. The practicality and valuable attribute of the results obtained from the study can be further analyzed by investors and market analysts in gaining a better understanding of <b>the</b> trading of <b>share</b> <b>prices</b> of oil and gas companies in Malaysia...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine whether {{shareholders}} consider the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) as value-relevant for the participating firms.

Through an event study, it is shown that <b>share</b> <b>prices</b> actually increased as a result of the allowance price drop when firms have a lower carbon-intensity of production and larger allowance holdings. There was no significant value impact from firms׳ allowance trade activity or from the pass-through of carbon-related production costs (carbon leakage). The conclusion is that the EU ETS does ‘bite’. The main impact on <b>the</b> <b>share</b> <b>prices</b> of firms arises from their carbon-intensity of production. The EU ETS is thus valued as a restriction on pollution...|$|R
