25|$|In {{areas of}} {{language}} modeling, there are {{limitations on the}} applicability of any language model as the statistics for different types of text will be different. When a language technology application is put into use (applied to a new <b>text</b> <b>type),</b> it is not certain that the language model will fare {{in the same way}} as how it would when applied to the training corpus. It is found that there are substantial variations in model performance when the training corpus changes. This lack of theory types limits the assessment of the usefulness of language-modeling work.|$|E
25|$|An 'Old Latin' {{version of}} Tatian's Syriac text {{appears to have}} {{circulated}} in the West from the late 2nd century; with a sequence adjusted to conform more closely {{to that of the}} canonical Gospel of Luke; and also including additional canonical text (such as the pericope of the adulteress), as well, possibly, as non-canonical matter from the Gospel of the Hebrews. With the gradual adoption of the Vulgate as the liturgical Gospel text of the Latin Church, the Latin Diatessaron was increasingly modified to conform to Vulgate readings. In 546 Victor of Capua discovered such a mixed manuscript; and, further corrected by Victor so as to provide a very pure Vulgate text within a modified Diatessaron sequence and to restore the two genealogies of Jesus side-by-side, this harmony, the Codex Fuldensis, survives in the monastic library at Fulda, where it served as the source text for vernacular harmonies in Old High German, Eastern Frankish and Old Saxon (the alliterative poem 'Heliand'). The older mixed Vulgate/Diatessaron <b>text</b> <b>type</b> also appears to have continued as a distinct tradition, as such texts appear to underlie surviving 13th–14th century Gospel harmonies in Middle Dutch, Middle High German, Middle French, Middle English, Tuscan and Venetian; although no example of this hypothetical Latin sub-text has ever been identified. The Liège Diatessaron is a particularly poetic example. This Latin Diatessaron textual tradition has also been suggested as underlying the enigmatic 16th century Islam-influenced Gospel of Barnabas (Joosten, 2002).|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine four speech-related <b>text</b> <b>types</b> {{in terms of}} how linguistically close they are to spoken {{face-to-face}} interaction. Our “conversational” diagnostics include lexical repetitions, question marks (as an indicator of question-answer adjacency pairs), interruptions, and several single word interactive features (first- and second-person pronouns, private verbs and demonstrative pronouns). We discuss the nature of these diagnostics and then consider their distribution across our <b>text</b> <b>types</b> and across the period 1600 to 1720. We reveal: (1) a differential distribution across our <b>text</b> <b>types</b> (and suggest a number of explanatory factors), and (2) a shift over our period towards features associated with spoken face-to-face interaction (and make the tentative suggestion that this finding {{may be due to the}} development of “popular” literatures).
