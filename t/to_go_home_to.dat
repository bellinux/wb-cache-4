500|$|Throughout the series, Allen {{refused to}} use Bodyline tactics, and openly said so within the team. His {{attitude}} made him popular with Australian spectators. Jardine twice {{tried to force}} the issue. Before the first Test, he asked Allen to bowl more bouncers with fielders on the leg side; Allen refused, saying {{he did not want}} to play cricket like that and that Jardine should leave him out if he was not happy. Prior to the second Test, Jardine again approached Allen and said that Larwood and Voce wanted him to bowl short, and believed that he only refused because he wanted to maintain his popularity. Allen wrote home: [...] "Well, I burst and said a good deal about swollen-headed, gutless, uneducated miners." [...] Allen threatened not to play, and <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> relate the events of the tour to the press. Jardine did not pursue the matter. Others in the team also opposed Bodyline. The Nawab of Pataudi refused to field in the [...] "leg trap"—the ring of fielders positioned on the leg side to catch deflections from short deliveries—during the first Test. Allen had no compunction fielding there; at short leg he held five catches from Larwood's bowling in the series. Upon his return to England, Allen continued to oppose Bodyline tactics, making his opinion known to senior figures in the MCC, and leading a debate among county representatives which resulted in legislation to ban the tactic after the 1934 season.|$|E

Sol and Naz grow closer when she watches him do his dance routine, and they almost kiss twice but are interrupted both times, the second time by the arrival of Ekin who reveals he and Naz are engaged.
