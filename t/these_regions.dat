5|$|In reaction–diffusion systems modeled by the Allen–Cahn equation, the {{limiting}} behavior for fast reaction, slow diffusion, {{and two or}} more local minima of energy with the same energy level as each other is for the system to settle into regions of different local minima, with the fronts delimiting boundaries between <b>these</b> <b>regions</b> evolving according to the curve-shortening flow.|$|E

5|$|There were varying {{types of}} land {{ownership}} and tenure {{depending on the}} topography and climate of one's locality. In hilly, peripheral areas far from trade routes, most peasant farmers owned and cultivated their own fields. In frontier regions such as Hunan and Sichuan, owners of wealthy estates gathered serfs to till their lands. The most advanced areas had few estates with serfs tilling the fields; <b>these</b> <b>regions</b> had long fostered wet-rice cultivation, which did not require centralized management of farming. Landlords set fixed rents for tenant farmers in <b>these</b> <b>regions,</b> while independent small farming families also owned their own lots.|$|E

As a consequence, recent authorities have split it into three: This restricts the true spotted eagle ray (A. narinari) to the Atlantic, while the Indo-Pacific population is the ocellated eagle ray (A. ocellatus) and the East Pacific is the Pacific white-spotted eagle ray (A. laticeps).|$|E
5|$|A cheap, {{cost-effective}} {{and practical}} alternative in poorer countries is visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA).

40|$|In {{the case}} of chest tomography, {{particularly}} the mediastinum and the pulmonary hilar tomography are difficult to the matter without exposure time factor. For the reason, <b>these</b> <b>region</b> are much used rectilinear tomography for the shortening of exposure time. But, as for the visuability of the morphology, it is advisable for <b>these</b> <b>region</b> to use in multi-directional tomography. However, it {{is in need of}} long exposure time. Therefore, authours experimented with stereozonography of short exposure time by circular movemant using a compensating filter and computed radiography. Shifting distance of Xray tube for stereofraphy was 10 % of distance between focus and object. The exposure time and exposure angle were 0. 6 sec, 2 θ= 3 ° respectively. As a result, this stereozonography was excellent in the visuabilities of mediastinal region, including bronchovascular shadows, and could examine in details is on images of <b>these</b> <b>region.</b> My using the compensating filter, the improved image guality of mediastinal region was obstained. On addition, using computed radiographic system, even if artifact araised from disagreement between from of the computed radiographic system, even if artifact araised from disagreement metween form of rhe compensating filter and mediastinal region, authors could easily restored non-diagnostic image by orverall density manipulation and unsharp mask piltering...|$|R
5|$|As {{with nearly}} all primates, strepsirrhines {{typically}} reside in tropical rainforests. These habitats allow strepsirrhines and other primates to evolve diverse communities of sympatric species. In the eastern rainforests of Madagascar, {{as many as}} 11 or 12species share the same forests, and prior to human arrival, some forests had nearly double that diversity. Several species of lemur are found in drier, seasonal forests, including the spiny forest on {{the southern tip of}} the island, although the lemur communities in <b>these</b> <b>regions</b> are not as rich.|$|E
5|$|At about 75 Jupiter radii {{from the}} planet, the {{interaction}} of the magnetosphere with the solar wind generates a bow shock. Surrounding Jupiter's magnetosphere is a magnetopause, located at the inner edge of a magnetosheath—a region between it and the bow shock. The solar wind interacts with <b>these</b> <b>regions,</b> elongating the magnetosphere on Jupiter's lee side and extending it outward until it nearly reaches the orbit of Saturn. The four largest moons of Jupiter all orbit within the magnetosphere, which protects them from the solar wind.|$|E
5|$|At {{the ends}} of the linear {{chromosomes}} are specialized regions of DNA called telomeres. The main function of <b>these</b> <b>regions</b> is to allow the cell to replicate chromosome ends using the enzyme telomerase, as the enzymes that normally replicate DNA cannot copy the extreme 3′ ends of chromosomes. These specialized chromosome caps also help protect the DNA ends, and stop the DNA repair systems in the cell from treating them as damage to be corrected. In human cells, telomeres are usually lengths of single-stranded DNA containing several thousand repeats of a simple TTAGGG sequence.|$|E

5|$|English in England can {{be divided}} into four major dialect regions, Southwest English, South East English, Midlands English, and Northern English. Within each of <b>these</b> <b>regions</b> several local subdialects exist: Within the Northern region, there is a {{division}} between the Yorkshire dialects, and the Geordie dialect spoken in Northumbria around Newcastle, and the Lancashire dialects with local urban dialects in Liverpool (Scouse) and Manchester (Mancunian).
