5|$|The upper {{atmosphere}} of Venus {{can be measured}} from Earth when the planet crosses the sun in a rare event known as a solar transit. The last solar transit of Venus occurred in 2012. Using quantitative astronomical spectroscopy, scientists were able <b>to</b> <b>analyse</b> sunlight that passed through the planet's atmosphere to reveal chemicals within it. As the technique <b>to</b> <b>analyse</b> light to discover information about a planet's atmosphere only first showed results in 2001, {{this was the first}} opportunity to gain conclusive results in this way on the atmosphere of Venus since observation of solar transits began. This solar transit was a rare opportunity considering the lack of information on the atmosphere between 65 and 85km. The solar transit in 2004 enabled astronomers to gather a large amount of data useful not only in determining the composition of the {{upper atmosphere}} of Venus, but also in refining techniques used in searching for extrasolar planets. The atmosphere of mostly CO2, absorbs near-infrared radiation, making it easy to observe. During the 2004 transit, the absorption in the atmosphere as a function of wavelength revealed the properties of the gases at that altitude. The Doppler shift of the gases also enabled wind patterns to be measured.|$|E

5|$|Thin {{sectioning}} was {{an early}} procedure used <b>to</b> <b>analyse</b> fossilised material contained in coal balls. The process required cutting a coal ball with a diamond saw, then flattening and polishing the thin section with an abrasive. It would be glued to a slide and placed under a petrographic microscope for examination. Although the process could be done with a machine, {{the large amount of}} time needed and the poor quality of samples produced by thin sectioning gave way to a more convenient method.|$|E
5|$|X-ray powder {{diffraction}} {{has also}} been used <b>to</b> <b>analyse</b> coal balls. The X-rays of a predetermined wavelength are sent through a sample to examine its structure. This reveals information about the crystallographic structure, chemical composition, and physical properties of the examined material. The scattered intensity of the X-ray pattern is observed and analysed, with the measurements consisting of incident and scattered angle, polarisation, and wavelength or energy.|$|E

On 23 September 1846, the night following his receipt of the letter, Galle and his student Heinrich d'Arrest discovered Neptune, exactly where Le Verrier had predicted. There remained some slight discrepancies in the giant planets' orbits. These were taken to indicate the existence of yet another planet orbiting beyond Neptune.|$|E
