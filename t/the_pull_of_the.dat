25|$|The {{rotator cuff}} is an {{anatomical}} term {{given to the}} group of four muscles and their tendons that act to stabilize the shoulder. These muscles are the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor and subscapularis and that hold the head of the humerus in the glenoid cavity during movement. The cuff adheres to the glenohumeral capsule and attaches {{to the head of the}} humerus. Together, these keep the humeral head in the glenoid cavity, preventing upward migration of the humeral head caused by <b>the</b> <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deltoid muscle at the beginning of arm elevation. The infraspinatus and the teres minor, along with the anterior fibers of the deltoid muscle, are responsible for external rotation of the arm.|$|E
25|$|With {{the other}} members of her family preoccupied, Miriam's {{obsession}} takes a new turn when she finds herself entering people's houses and stealing small objects from them. Several times she is almost discovered, but, though she tries to anchor herself to the real world through emotionally detached sex with Saul, she cannot resist <b>the</b> <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> empty houses. At the National Spelling Bee, Eliza performs well but does not win, so she begins to prepare for the following year, with Saul's enthusiastic help. But the family is about to be torn apart. Miriam is arrested, pleads {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity, and is admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Aaron announces his intention to leave home, and his faith, to join ISKCON.|$|E

50|$|The Qalb {{is called}} <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mystic; it is caught between <b>the</b> {{downward}} <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower nafs, and <b>the</b> upward <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spirit <b>of</b> Allah {{and may be}} blackened by sin. It may be purified by reciting <b>the</b> names <b>of</b> God. <b>The</b> Ruh is <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spirit, <b>the</b> breath <b>of</b> Allah; when awakened, it counteracts <b>the</b> negative <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nafs. The Sirr is the innermost heart, where Allah manifests his mystery to himself.|$|R
25|$|There are a {{great number}} of special casts meant to evade {{problems}} like trees behind the angler (roll cast), <b>the</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line on the fly by <b>the</b> action <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stream, or to make the fly land more softly.|$|R
25|$|At the mid-oceanic ridges, two tectonic plates diverge {{from one}} another as new oceanic crust is formed by the cooling and solidifying of hot molten rock. Because the crust is very thin at these ridges due to <b>the</b> <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tectonic plates, the release of {{pressure}} leads to adiabatic expansion (without transfer of heat or matter) and the partial melting of the mantle, causing volcanism and creating new oceanic crust. Most divergent plate boundaries are {{at the bottom of}} the oceans; therefore, most volcanic activity on the Earth is submarine, forming new seafloor. Black smokers (also known as deep sea vents) are evidence of this kind of volcanic activity. Where the mid-oceanic ridge is above sea-level, volcanic islands are formed; for example, Iceland.|$|E
500|$|Despite the lukewarm {{nature of}} the {{contemporary}} reviews, <b>the</b> <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> James Bond name was sufficient {{to make it the}} 13th highest-grossing film in North America in 1967 with a gross of $22.7 million and a worldwide total of $41.7 million ($ million in [...] dollars). Orson Welles attributed the success of the film to a marketing strategy that featured a naked tattooed woman on the film's posters and print ads as well as a billboard in New York's Times Square. The campaign also included a series of commercials featuring British model Twiggy. [...] As late as 2011, the film was still making money for the estate of Peter Sellers, who negotiated an extraordinary 3% of the gross profits (an estimated £120 million), with the proceeds currently going to Cassie Unger, the daughter and sole heir of Sellers' beneficiary, fourth wife Lynne Frederick.|$|E
500|$|A large seabird, the albatross, {{played a}} central part in Samuel Taylor Coleridge's {{influential}} 1798 poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, which in turn {{gave rise to the}} usage of albatross as metaphor for a burden. In his 1902 poem The Sea and the Hills, Rudyard Kipling expresses the urge for the sea, and uses alliteration to suggest the sea's sound and rhythms: [...] "Who hath desired the Sea?—the sight of salt water unbounded— The heave and the halt and the hurl and the crash of the comber wind-hounded?" [...] John Masefield also felt <b>the</b> <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea in his Sea Fever, writing [...] "I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky." [...] The Argentine Jorge Luis Borges wrote the 1964 poem El mar (The Sea), treating it as something that constantly regenerates the world and the people who contemplate it, and that is very close to the essence of being human.|$|E

500|$|Mau {{was born}} Pius Piailug in 1932, {{in the village}} of Weiso, on the small coral island of Satawal, in Yap State of the Caroline Islands, a part of the Federated States of Micronesia. Satawal is a wooded island with an area of , located in the western Pacific Ocean about [...] south of Guam. Mau's {{personal}} connection to the sea began early in his life, when he was placed in tide pools in his infancy so he could feel <b>the</b> <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ocean. At the age of four or five, Mau was chosen by his grandfather Raangipi to study as an apprentice navigator. Mau initially protested his grandfather's teaching, preferring to spend his time playing on the beach with children his own age. [...] Raangipi trained Mau as a young navigator for many years. Their day would begin at sunrise, when they would eat breakfast together and afterwards, take care of chores before they went fishing. During the evening, Mau would join the men in the canoe house as they drank, listening to their stories about navigation and sailing. Raangipi told the young boy that if he chose to become a navigator, Mau could gain respect from his community, eat well, and maintain a position in Satawalese society higher than that of a chief. Encouraged, Mau learned basic navigational clues regarding the [...] "stars, swells, and birds" [...] from Raangipi, but his grandfather died sometime before Mau was fourteen.|$|E
2500|$|With the British {{presence}} on Diamond Rock firmly established, Hood departed with Centaur, and the French {{saw an opportunity}} to attack. Four boatloads of soldiers were despatched at night, though the sailors who rowed there were extremely pessimistic as to their chances. Exhausted {{by the time they}} arrived at the rock, the men were not able to resist <b>the</b> <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strong current and were swept out to sea. They were eventually able to make it back to Martinique, with the British only learning of the attempt several days later. The British could have easily sunk the French boats had the French made a daylight assault. [...] Disheartened by their failure, the French made no further attempts to attack the fort from the island. Maurice and his men devoted their time after this to raiding, cutting out ships from the Martinique coast, and interdicting trade.|$|E
2500|$|On 13 April 1987, a Hiller 12E {{helicopter}} {{was being used}} for the installation of a rotating beacon atop the control tower, then under construction. The beacon {{was attached to the}} helicopter for lifting by a chain sling. After the beacon had been lifted into place, workers disconnected the chain sling from it. As the {{helicopter was}} departing, The hook on the sling became snagged on the tower guard rail... causing it to pitch nose down and roll to the right. With the cable being tensioned by <b>the</b> <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> helicopter the hook freed itself [...] towards the helicopter. The cable flew up around the tail boom and became entangled in one of the main rotor blades. The other main rotor blade severed the tail boom which fell free of the helicopter striking the side of the tower {{on its way to the}} ground. The major section of the helicopter then fell to the ground at the base of the tower, caught fire and was burnt out.The accident resulted in the death of the helicopter pilot. The subsequent investigation conducted by the Australian Transport Safety Board, found that the pilot's licence was not endorsed for sling loading operations and he was not sufficiently current on the aircraft type... to undertake such a job.|$|E

And now I {{experienced}} a sensation {{which must have}} been very like that which comes to a condemned criminal at <b>the</b> first indication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drop. Then there was a horrible sinking, a gurgle, and a swash, and the ocean over which I had been gazing appeared to rise up and envelop me.|$|R
60|$|The older ape, pessimistic by nature, {{recognized}} no {{such thing}} as humor. Creatures laid their paws upon him for but two things--to search for fleas and to attack. <b>The</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tarmangani-scented thing about his head and eyes could not be for <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former act; therefore it must be the latter. He was attacked! Chulk had attacked him.|$|R

The rider encourages the horse to stretch into soft hands that allow the horse to lift <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neck, coming up into the bridle, and should always follow <b>the</b> natural motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> animal’s head. The horse should have equal contact in both reins.|$|R
2500|$|Édouard Yan’ Dargent {{was born}} on the 15 October 1824 at Saint-Servais {{situated}} between Landerneau and Landivisiau. His father Claude Dargent had come from Lorraine and was a tanner. His mother Marguerite Perrine Clémentine Robée {{was the daughter of}} Pierre Robée. Claude had become the mayor {{at the time of the}} July Monarchy. Yani's mother died when he was only two years of age and his father soon remarried and Dargent was put in the care of his maternal grandfather Pierre Robée, a retired sailor. He was educated at Plouaret at a school where his uncle Thomas, an ex-chouan, was schoolmaster. He received a basic education alongside François-Marie Luzel, the Breton poet, who was also a good friend. [...] He then attended the Landerneau Saint-Joseph college until, at the age of twelve, he moved to Saint-Pol-de-Léon's Notre-Dame du Kreizker Institute. After his schooldays he rejoined his father who had moved to Landerneau being unable to set-up his tannery in Morlaix. When the time came to choose a career, Yan' Dargent's grandfather wanted him to join the navy but Yani' did not feel <b>the</b> <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea, being mostly interested in mathematics and design. He successfully passed his exams and was admitted to the government department administrating bridges and highways and then moved to the railways. In 1846, he was in Troyes as a works inspector for the construction of the railway when he met a professor called Jules-Nicolas Schitz who recognized Dargent's aptitude for drawing and the two made trips into the countryside to sketch (Dargent never attended an art college and was self-taught).|$|E
