For rescission the claimant may have a restitutionary remedy to recover any enrichment that a defendant has received under the contract (and in return give up any enrichment the claimant has received). The claimant may also have a tort claim for any losses that had arisen. In principle the rescission remedy is available for fraud and negligent misrepresentation as of right. For innocent misrepresentation, however, Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(2) gives the court discretion to award damages instead of rescission if undue hardship to the defendant would result.

40|$|This study aims to {{establish}} the validity <b>of</b> the automatic <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> employment <b>contract.</b> The automatic <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> employment <b>contract</b> means that the contract is terminated ex lege and not by <b>an</b> act <b>of</b> the employer. Such termination will therefore not qualify as a dismissal for purposes of section 186 of the LRA. The result is that these employees {{will not be able}} to challenge the fairness <b>of</b> such <b>termination</b> based on the unfair dismissal provisions in the LRA. It may be argued that such automatic terminations offer employers the opportunity to effectively circumvent their obligations under the LRA with regards to the fairness <b>of</b> dismissals. Automatic <b>termination</b> provisions are often used by employers as a mechanism to this. The Constitution of the RSA provides that everyone has the right to fair labour practices. 1 This constitutionally guaranteed right is given effect to in the LRA 2 which provides employees with the right not to be unfairly dismissed. 3 By depriving employees of their protection against unfair dismissal, it may be argued that their fundamental rights to fair labour practices are infringed. This study aims to investigate the topic <b>of</b> automatic <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> employment contracts by analysing the provisions of, inter alia, the LRA and the Constitution of the RSA in order to determine the extent of protection afforded to employees against exploitation in circumstances such as these and will consider various findings of courts that may shed light on the matter.

Firms could therefore use the limited length of fixed-term contracts to adjust their wage bills through labor turnover when hiring new employees or after a renewal. The main goal of fixed-term contracts is precisely to provide firms with the additional flexibility they might need to adjust their production level due to (negative or positive) economic shocks (Bentolila et al. 1994; Goux et al. 2001).|$|R

50|$|In Canadian National Railway Company v. The Queen, 88 DTC 6340, the {{taxpayer}} received an amount upon the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> for the transportation by road and rail of certain supplies and building materials. Justice Strayer of the Federal Court-Trial Division {{held that the}} operations under the contract did not constitute a separate business {{and that they were}} not that significant that the termination of the contract destroyed {{the taxpayer}}'s “profit-making apparatus” or seriously dislocated its “normal commercial organization”. He went on to hold {{that the purpose of the}} compensation provision in the contract was to enable the taxpayer to “absorb the shock as one of the normal incidents to be looked for” and that the compensation received was “no more than a surrogatum for the future profits surrendered”. As a result, the payment was income. In contrast, in Pe Ben Industries Company Limited v. The Queen, (88 DTC 6347), heard concurrently with Canadian National Railway, a similar payment was held to be capital. In that case, Justice Strayer concluded that the payment was compensation for the destruction of a distinct part of the taxpayer's business. It had been the first “intermodal” undertaking of the taxpayer, which required it to establish a base of operations at a rail yard solely for that purpose. Justice Strayer held that the termination of the contract put an end to the intermodal operations of the taxpayer, such that the payment was capital. He went on to hold that the taxpayer's rights under the contract constituted “property” and that the termination payment constituted “compensation for property destroyed” and therefore proceeds of disposition received in respect of the property. Since the taxpayer had a nil adjusted cost basis in the contract, the amount of the termination payment was a capital gain.|$|E

The agency relationship had lasted twenty years prior to its termination. Given the length of the agency relationship, its importance to the taxpayer's business operations, and the fact that the taxpayer suffered decreased sales by reason of its inability to replace the agency with an equivalent arrangement, the Exchequer Court found the damages to be capital. The Court held that the damages related to the loss of the taxpayer's interest in the goodwill and business in Doulton products in Canada, which the Court viewed as “a capital asset <b>of</b> <b>an</b> enduring nature”.|$|R
40|$|Background One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} issues related to the human embryo is the determination of the moment when an embryo is considered a human being and acquires a moral status. Although personhood and moral status are frequently mentioned in medical ethics, they are considered interdisciplinary as concepts that shape the debate in medical law (fiqh) since their consequences are influential in the way which the parents and other individuals behave towards the embryo. Materials and Methods This analytical-descriptive research gathered relevant data in a literature search. After <b>a</b> description <b>of</b> the fundamentals and definitions, we subsequently analyzed juridical texts and selected one of the viewpoints that regarded the surrogacy contract revocation. Results The surrogacy <b>contract</b> is <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> based upon which two sides (infertile couple and surrogate mother) involved in making the contract are obligated to fulfill its terms. Therefore, contract revocation can be surveyed from three perspectives: mutual revocation (iqala), legal unilateral wills (khiar al-majlis, khiar al-ayb), and contractual wills (khiar al-shart). Conclusion Revocation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> surrogacy <b>contract</b> either by the genetic parents, surrogate or the fertility clinic is allowed by Muslim jurists only when the embryo lacks personhood. Based on Islamic teachings, the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> surrogacy <b>contract</b> in and after the sixteenth week of pregnancy, when the embryo acquires a human soul (ensoulment), is not allowed. However religious thought emphasizes the moral status of the fetus before the sixteenth week and states that optional <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> the surrogacy contract is not permitted while the fetus becomes a human being...|$|R

For example, neither properly accommodates the principle that a readiness and willingness to work provides consideration for wages.

Turnover {{of faculty and}} researchers is increasing alarmingly and costing the universities and the country at large. Fast turnover of health professionals from the health system and from academic institutions has recently received substantial attention from both academia and health sector managers. This paper calculates the faculty turnover rate at the College of Health Sciences of Addis Ababa University {{during the period of}} September 1991 to August 2011. Methods: The study was conducted at the College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University. Retrospective analysis of employee records was done. All records of the faculty that were working in the College during the 20 -year period, starting from September 1991 to August 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. Data were collected from the employee records accessed from the College’s human resources database and supplemented by payroll sheets and different reports.

30|$|In {{order to}} secure {{long-term}} profits, considering {{the costs and benefits}} of further training arrangements (Wolter et al. 2006), and to ensure a lasting employment relationship (Schömann and Becker 1995 : 190), the knowledge and skills conveyed in on-the-job further training courses are mostly firm-specific (Neubäumer 2008; Acemoglu and Pischke 1998). Therefore, qualified employees—especially employees in management as well as qualified commercial and technical employees, qualified craftsmen, and skilled workers—are more often offered opportunities for further training (Schiener et al. 2013; Schömann and Becker 1995; Becker 1991). This is <b>a</b> way <b>of</b> binding these employees to the company (Mühlemann and Wolter 2011). In order to prevent them from giving notice or being lured away by other companies, employers can oblige them to repay the costs of the further training courses if they leave prematurely (Leber 2000). Because this ensures that the costs and returns of further training are divided between the individual and the company, at least one party—employee or employer—has no interest in (prematurely) dissolving the employment agreement (Booth and Bryan 2005 : 391). In the case of imminent redundancies in the company, internal considerations will lead to <b>a</b> higher probability <b>of</b> being laid off for non-participants of further training courses compared to those who have participated (Büchel and Pannenberg 2004 : 79). Participation in on-the-job further training reduces employees’ probabilities of giving notice—as it does employers’ propensity to lay them off (Hypothesis 7). This is for reasons of profitability and also holds good regarding the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> employment <b>contract</b> by mutual agreement.|$|R
