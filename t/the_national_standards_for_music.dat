5000|$|Achievement {{standards}} are curricular statements used to guide educators in determining objectives for their teaching. Use of standards became {{a common practice}} in many nations during the 20th century. For much of its existence, the curriculum for music education in the United States was determined locally or by individual teachers. In recent decades {{there has been a}} significant move toward adoption of regional and/or national standards.

Each piece of music comes from a different region of the world: South America (Brazil), Africa (The Republic of Congo), Asia (Korea), and Eurasia (Russia). Each piece has at least eight accompanying lessons addressing {{the culture of the}} country, the history of the country, or musical aspects involved with performing the piece of music. The lessons are designed to fit into a portion of a day's rehearsal. Additionally, most of the lessons can be carried out in any order.

The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the importance of teaching improvisation to string musicians. This paper will discuss the history of improvisation, the importance of improvisation, the importance of creativity in the classroom. The results include lesson plans designed to teach improvisation to string players in grades seven and eight. Improvisation is the spontaneous act of creating music that is an important aspect of many types of music. A student uses knowledge of style, time period, technique and skill to create music spontaneously. The art of improvisation is a study that can help a musician to better understand a certain genre of music as well as to help creatively express ideas. <b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>Music</b> Education, a document created in 1994 as a curriculum guide, states that students should be able to improvise melodies, variations, and accompaniments.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to provide music {{educators}} with suggestions of {{how to make the}} blues a part of their instruction and present this unique art form as a vibrant and ‘living’ genre critical to the understanding of our own American musical heritage. This thesis explores the music, history and culture, viewing ‘music as culture,’ and the African-American tradition whose contribution defines so much of our American music. It discusses {{the ways in which the}} blues can fit into a comprehensive and discipline-based approach to music education that satisfies the goals as set forth by <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>Music</b> Education and, in so doing, broaden educators’ pedagogical approach to teaching the blues. This discussion stresses the importance of creating a classroom culture that parallels the way music is learned and practiced in the blues community, fostering an authentic understanding of the blues through singing, listening, movement, improvisation, composition, and, ultimately, performing. It is shown how a study of the blues can provide our students with new practical possibilities and perspectives for experiencing and generating music. Music EducationMastersUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|Several factors {{influence}} band directors ’ repertoire selection {{including the}} ability and instrumentation of the ensemble, preferences of students and parents, and the occasion for which the music is to be performed (Battisti, 1995; Prentice, 1986). Programming is also affected by music publishers who spend {{large sums of money}} to promote their latest products, and learning standards recommended by state and federal organizations. <b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>Music</b> (Music Educators National Conference [MENC], 1994), for example, calls on students to “perform music representing diverse genres and cultures ” {{and to be able to}} “classify [music] by genre and style (and if applicable, by historical period, composer, and title) ” (n. p.). The Illinois State Learning Standards for Fine Arts (Illinois State Board of Education [ISBE], 1997) makes similar statements, requiring students to “play…a variety of music representing diverse cultures and styles ” (n. p.). To meet these standards, band directors must program transcriptions of historical masterworks and music of various ethnic heritages including those from non-European cultures. One could also argue that works by women should be included as well. Topp (1989) supports these assertions stating “music by black composers is too little known and too littl...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} examined {{characteristics of}} {{a select group of}} tonal patterns to identify features that may affect the initial acquisition of skill in sight-singing pitch. Second graders (N = 193) individually read and sang 25 tonal patterns on a sight-singing pretest, posttest, and retention test. Between the pre- and posttest, the students practiced 15 of the patterns during general music classes, with one new pattern introduced and all previously presented patterns reviewed each session. Ten patterns not included in the instruction were read and sung only during tests. No pattern practice occurred for 8 weeks between the posttest and retention test. Sight-singing performance was assessed for pitch accuracy and contour accuracy. Pattern difficulty indices and difficulty rankings were determined {{on the basis of the}} results. Specific pattern features are considered in relation to these data, with some characteristics affecting accuracy with pitch and contour differently.

A multicultural approach to music teaching has become increasingly important in music education. Due to a lack of materials about Taiwanese songs in the United States, I designed music curriculum materials for American teachers to implement multicultural music education with four Taiwanese children's songs. Each song has four activities for different age levels of elementary students. These curriculum materials are designed based on <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>Music</b> Education. Included are an introduction to Taiwan, Taiwanese society, and the characteristics and cultural backgrounds of Taiwanese children's songs, so that American children may learn about Taiwanese culture and Taiwanese children's songs through these curriculum materials.

40|$|Pressures from {{education}} reforms {{have contributed to}} the need for music educators to embrace new and diverse instructional strategies to enhance the learning environment. Music teachers need to understand the pedagogy of teaching and learning and how these affect their praxis. The purpose of this multiple case evaluative study was to investigate the instructional methods used in 10 middle school general music programs to assist students in obtaining <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>Music</b> Education. Bloom 2 ̆ 7 s revised taxonomy was the theoretical framework used to evaluate the teaching praxis of the participating teachers. The research questions for the study addressed the effectiveness of the instructional strategies in the music classroom and how they align with the National Standards Music Education and Bloom 2 ̆ 7 s Revised Taxonomy. Data were collected from an open ended survey, individual interviews, and unobtrusive documents from 10 general music teachers from suburban, rural, and urban school districts. A line-by-line analysis was followed by a coding matrix to categorize collected data into themes and patterns. The results indicated that standards-based metacognitive instructional strategies can assist music teachers in their classrooms and unite cognitive, affective, and kinesthetic experiences applicable beyond the music classroom. It is recommended that music teachers use alternative teaching techniques to promote and connect critical thinking skills through musical learning experiences. Implications for positive social change include training music educators to create learning environments that support and motivate students to learn and achieve academic success...|$|E

40|$|<b>National</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> United States History and <b>National</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> World History were {{published}} on October, 1994. They were developed {{under the supervision}} of <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Center for History in the Schools that was run by Gary B. Nash and Charlotte Crabtree, codirectors of the standards project. This project received funding from both <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Endowment for <b>the</b> Humanities and the United States Department of Education. <b>The</b> <b>national</b> <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> history have been developed over the course of two years, during which time only minor criticisms of the standards arose. However, upon their publication, an earlier supporter of the standards became their biggest critic. Namely, Lynne V. Cheney, former president of <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Endowment for <b>the</b> Humanities, published an article in the Wall Street Journal dramatically named “The End of History”. In this article she publically criticized <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> United States Historyfor being politically correct, for giving too much emphasis to multiculturalism and for neglecting to mention some of the biggest names and events of American history. She was a supporter of the traditional view of history, according to which history in American classrooms should have a formative role and produce patriotic citizens. Even though L. Cheney was not the only critic of the Standards, she was the loudest and the most influential. However, when taking into account the political context surrounding the controversy about the Standards, Cheney’s arguments become rather thin. Lynne Cheney was the wife of Dick Cheney, a prominent politician and member of the Republican Party. The Standards {{were published}} in 1994 when American President was Bill Clinton, a Democrat. It is possible that L. Cheney was trying to undermine Bill Clinton’s administration {{in the wake of the}} upcoming presidential elections. Another Republican, Senator Slade Gorton, also contributed to the negative reception of the Standards. He proposed a non-binding resolution to the Senate that would condemn the Standards. The Senate passed the resolution with a nearly unanimous vote in January, 1995. However, the project was not dropped and in April 1996, after some changes of the content, a revised edition of the Standards was published. The most important change was deleting the examples of student achievement. Most of the criticism was focused on these examples, while ignoring the fact that they were completely voluntary and designed as guidelines for history 64 teachers. The omitting of the examples of student achievement significantly reduced the number of pages and <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> United States History and <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> World Historywere now published as one book, combined with <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> History for Grades K- 4.
