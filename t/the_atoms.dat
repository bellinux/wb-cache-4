5|$|A {{convenient}} {{means of}} determining {{the order of a}} given sigmatropic rearrangement is to number <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> of the bond being broken as atom 1, and then count <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> in each direction from the broken bond to <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> that form the new σ-bond in the product, numbering consecutively. The numbers that correspond to <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> forming the new bond are then separated by a comma and placed within brackets to create the sigmatropic reaction order descriptor.|$|E
5|$|When a {{continuous}} spectrum of energy is {{passed through a}} gas or plasma, some of the photons are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to change their energy level. Those excited electrons that remain bound to their atom spontaneously emit this energy as a photon, traveling in a random direction, and so drop back to lower energy levels. Thus <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> behave like a filter that forms a series of dark absorption bands in the energy output. (An observer viewing <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> from a view {{that does not include}} the continuous spectrum in the background, instead sees a series of emission lines from the photons emitted by <b>the</b> <b>atoms.)</b> Spectroscopic measurements of the strength and width of atomic spectral lines allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.|$|E

The theoretical analysis of these interactions became tractable because the noble gases are monatomic and <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> spherical, which means that the interaction between <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> is independent of direction, or isotropic.|$|E

5|$|This process, {{developed}} by Stony Brook Physics, yields francium isotopes with masses of 209, 210, and 211, {{which are then}} isolated by the magneto-optical trap (MOT). The production rate of a particular isotope depends on {{the energy of the}} oxygen beam. An 18O beam from the Stony Brook LINAC creates 210Fr in the gold target with the nuclear reaction 197Au + 18O → 210Fr + 5n. The production required some time to develop and understand. It was critical to operate the gold target very close to its melting point {{and to make sure that}} its surface was very clean. The nuclear reaction embeds the francium atoms deep in the gold target, and they must be removed efficiently. <b>The</b> <b>atoms</b> quickly diffuse to the surface of the gold target and are released as ions, but this does not happen every time. The francium ions are guided by electrostatic lenses until they land in a surface of hot yttrium and become neutral again. The francium is then injected into a glass bulb. A magnetic field and laser beams cool and confine <b>the</b> <b>atoms.</b> Although <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> remain in the trap for only about 20 seconds before escaping (or decaying), a steady stream of fresh atoms replaces those lost, keeping the number of trapped atoms roughly constant for minutes or longer. Initially, about 1000 francium atoms were trapped in the experiment. This was gradually improved and the setup is capable of trapping over 300,000 neutral atoms of francium a time. These are neutral metallic atoms in a gaseous unconsolidated state. Enough francium is trapped that a video camera can capture the light given off by <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> as they fluoresce. <b>The</b> <b>atoms</b> appear as a glowing sphere about 1 millimeter in diameter. This was the first time that anyone had ever seen francium. The researchers can now make extremely sensitive measurements of the light emitted and absorbed by the trapped atoms, providing the first experimental results on various transitions between atomic energy levels in francium. Initial measurements show very good agreement between experimental values and calculations based on quantum theory. Other synthesis methods include bombarding radium with neutrons, and bombarding thorium with protons, deuterons, or helium ions. Francium has not been synthesized in amounts large enough to weigh.|$|E
5|$|A {{promethium}} atom has 61 electrons, {{arranged in}} the configuration 4f56s2.

It is the only exception to the general trend of the contraction of <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> with increase of atomic radius (caused by the lanthanide contraction) that is not caused by the filled (or half-filled) 4f-subshell.|$|E

Almost all of the amino acids in proteins are (S) at the α carbon, with cysteine being (R) and glycine non-chiral.

5|$|So far {{some success}} has been {{achieved}} in using string theory methods to describe the transition of a superfluid to an insulator. A superfluid is a system of electrically neutral atoms that flows without any friction. Such systems are often produced in the laboratory using liquid helium, but recently experimentalists have developed new ways of producing artificial superfluids by pouring trillions of cold atoms into a lattice of criss-crossing lasers. These atoms initially behave as a superfluid, but as experimentalists increase {{the intensity of the}} lasers, they become less mobile and then suddenly transition to an insulating state. During the transition, <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> behave in an unusual way. For example, <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> slow to a halt at a rate that depends on the temperature and on Planck's constant, the fundamental parameter of quantum mechanics, which does not enter into the description of the other phases.

5|$|Some of the charged {{particles}} do {{get into the}} magnetosphere. These spiral around field lines, bouncing {{back and forth between}} the poles several times per second.

This results in systematic group trends: as one goes down group18, the atomic radius, and with it the interatomic forces, increases, resulting in an increasing melting point, boiling point, enthalpy of vaporization, and solubility.
