50|$|It was a {{conventional}} design, albeit with some unique characteristics. The carriage was {{mounted on a}} double-crank, curved axle which made it lower to the ground, reducing visibility and improving stability. The curved axle allowed the weapon to <b>traverse</b> <b>without</b> movement of the wheels, although traverse was still limited {{by the need to}} prevent the recoiling barrel from hitting the carriage. In addition the spade was pivot-mounted allowing the weapon to <b>traverse</b> <b>without</b> disturbing the spade. This movement of the carriage without moving the wheels or spade produced a very accurate weapon.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Two general {{techniques}} for implementing a domain-specific language (DSL) with less overhead are the finally-tagless embedding of object {{programs and the}} direct-style representation of side effects. We use these techniques to build a DSL for probabilistic programming, for expressing countable probabilistic models and performing exact inference and importance sampling on them. Our language is embedded as an ordinary OCaml library and represents probability distributions as ordinary OCaml programs. We use delimited continuations to reify probabilistic programs as lazy search trees, which inference algorithms may <b>traverse</b> <b>without</b> imposing any interpretive overhead on deterministic parts of a model. We thus {{take advantage of the}} existing OCaml implementation to achieve competitive performance and ease of use. Inference algorithms can easily be embedded in probabilistic programs themselves...|$|R

Speed bumps can also pose serious hazards to motorcyclists and bicyclists if they are not clearly visible, though in some cases a small cut across the bump allows those vehicles to <b>traverse</b> <b>without</b> impediment.

30|$|Algorithm 1 {{presents}} the maxRD in details. The main characteristic {{of this method}} is that the graph traverse {{is based on a}} deterministic selection rule (Step 10) - the ranking of nodes according to their degree values (local information). The only parameter of the algorithm is the number s of the initial starting nodes (seeds). The algorithm, starting from s initial nodes, performs s parallel graph <b>traverses</b> <b>without</b> crossing the same edges for a second time. The visited nodes remain present in the graph and only the selected edges are removed (Step 14). Thus, any selected node can be visited many times, but not from the same paths. This edge-elimination process alters the original graph and eventually the nodes degree and ranking. Hence, neither the nodes degree nor the graph are stable.|$|R
