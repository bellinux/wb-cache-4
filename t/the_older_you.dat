500|$|As a child, Fonda {{suffered}} from a poor self-image and {{lack of confidence in}} her appearance, an issue exacerbated by her father Henry Fonda. On the subject, Fonda said [...] "I was raised in the ‘50s. I was taught by my father [...] that how I looked was all that mattered, frankly. He was a good man, and I was mad for him, but he sent messages to me that fathers should not send: Unless you look perfect, you're not going to be loved." [...] In adulthood, Fonda developed bulimia which took a toll on her quality of life for many years, an issue that also affected her mother Frances Ford Seymour who committed suicide when Fonda was 12. On the subject of her recovery from bulimia, Fonda said, [...] "It was in my 40s, and if you suffer from bulimia, <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>you</b> get, the worse it gets. It takes longer to recover from a bout...I had a career, I was winning awards, I was supporting nonprofits, I had a family. I had to make a choice: I live or I die." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Mario Motta, {{president}} of the Massachusetts Medical Society, [...] "... glare from bad lighting is a public-health hazard—especially <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>you</b> become. Glare light scattering in the eye causes loss of contrast and leads to unsafe driving conditions, much like the glare on a dirty windshield from low-angle sunlight or the high beams from an oncoming car." [...] In essence bright and/or badly shielded lights around roads can partially blind drivers or pedestrians and contribute to accidents.|$|E

And everything you thought you knew, <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>you</b> get, you realize, 'Damn, I don't know nothing about this. I better pay attention, I better listen and keep learning.'

5000|$|The theatre, {{despite her}} success in films, was always to remain Kerr's first love, even though going on stage {{filled her with}} trepidation: I do it because it's exactly like {{dressing}} up for the grown ups.
