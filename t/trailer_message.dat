Tradacoms uses 'Files'; {{with one or}} more {{examples}} of the message being preceded by a header message, and followed by one or more <b>trailer</b> <b>messages.</b> This avoids the duplication of common header and trailer information which can occur in a series of EDIFACT messages.|$|R

500|$|... 2012 was marketed by {{the fictional}} Institute for Human Continuity, {{featuring}} {{a book by}} Jackson Curtis (Farewell Atlantis), streaming media, blog updates and radio broadcasts from zealot Charlie Frost on his website, This Is The End. On November12,2008, the studio released the first trailer for 2012. With a tsunami surging over the Himalayas and a purportedly-scientific message {{that the world would}} end in 2012, the <b>trailer's</b> <b>message</b> was that international governments were not preparing their populations for the event. The trailer ended with a suggestion to viewers to [...] "find out the truth" [...] by entering [...] "2012" [...] on a search engine. The Guardian called the film's marketing [...] "deeply flawed", associating it with [...] "websites that make even more spurious claims about 2012".|$|R

40|$|Speed {{monitoring}} displays (i. e., speed trailers) {{have been}} evaluated in many states for reducing vehicular speeds in work zones. This study evaluated the enhancements to speed <b>trailers</b> regarding <b>message</b> size, the use of flashing, {{and the presence of}} more than one speed trailer in work zones. Field tests were conducted at two sites in the Las Vegas, Nevada, area, and traffic data were collected for statistical analysis. Regression models were developed to estimate the speeding likelihood and vehicle speeds {{on the basis of the}} free-flow speed data. The results indicated that the size of displayed messages and the use of flashing did show significant impact on speeding likelihood and speed reduction for vehicles in work zones. The extent of the impact varied for vehicle classification, the lanes they were operating in, and the day or night in which they were deployed. This study recommended larger message size and the use of flashing signs for speed trailers. More than one speed trailer was recommended for additional speed reduction...|$|R

Page R- 3 - 13 Error in maximum length of DE 7140 has been corrected. Page R- 3 - 16 The value 47 (invoiced quantity) has been added in QTY DE 6063, for use when a price or discount discrepancy is reported. Page R- 3 - 17 CDI DE 7006 has been specified to carry the customer’s expected unit price or expected discount percentage when a price or discount discrepancy is reported.

R. 3. 1 PRINCIPLES The RETANN message is sent from a customer to a supplier, to notify an intention to return books to the supplier and to request authorisation where needed. Overstock returns and returns due to discrepancies or defects in delivered items are all handled as part of a single process and may be listed in a single message. The message also allows a customer to notify a delivery shortage or an invoiced price or discount discrepancy, though this does not of course lead to a return – it simply alerts the supplier to take appropriate action. Like all EDIFACT transaction messages, RETANN has a header, a variable number of message lines (up to a maximum of 9, 999 in a single <b>message),</b> and a <b>trailer.</b> Schematically, the <b>message</b> structure looks like this...|$|R
