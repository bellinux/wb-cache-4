The primary research was collected by interviewing 10 high street <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> around Edinburgh. Independent, specialised and multi-chain <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> were interviewed in order to gain the most representative data possible.

The empirical findings showed that: Most Eastern Cape <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> perceived relationship marketing as important; <b>Travel</b> <b>agents</b> realized the importance of the management of such relationship marketing strategies; Most <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> were aware of or used retention strategies to enhance relationship marketing strategies; <b>Travel</b> <b>agents</b> realized that to survive relationship marketing should be part of their future planning; All respondents believed that to successfully implement relationship marketing, all staff, from front-line to top-management, need to be committed to the programme.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study which uses {{sociolinguistics}} approach to analyze the apology strategies used by <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> in responding to a complaint. This study {{is trying to figure}} out the differences between the male <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> toward the client and the female <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> toward the client in the use of apology strategies. Furthermore, it will also describe the possible reasons of the differences made by the male <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> and the female <b>travel</b> <b>agents.</b> Hence, the data are taken from the utterances produced by the male <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> and the female <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> when they converse with the client. To interpret the findings, the data are analyzed by classifying the responses into the categories formulated by Trosborg's Apology Strategies and analyzed with the theories on Gender in Language. From the interpretation and conclusion of the analysis, it can be seen that almost all strategies formulated by Trosborg appear in the response of the male <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> and the female <b>travel</b> <b>agents.</b> Moreover, the difference in the use of apology strategies appear in the conversations and it can be assumed that the female <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> are likely to be more co-operative in explaining and the male <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> look more concern to the client. Thus, the existence of apology strategies can be considered as an important matter to serve as a bridge to bring a social harmony in society.

Proportions of first-time attendees of travel clinics reporting referral by a <b>travel</b> <b>agent</b> were monitored in order to detect post-intervention changes. Evaluation of the intervention revealed a small improvement in travel agents' overall attitudes and beliefs (p = 0. 03), in particular their intention to refer (p = 0. 01).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes {{specific issues}} {{in the distribution of}} air travel. In three separate chapters, I analyze (1) the nature competition among online <b>travel</b> <b>agents,</b> (2) <b>travel</b> <b>agent</b> commission overrides as an explanation of dispersion in quoted ticket prices and (3) the response of a traditional <b>travel</b> <b>agent</b> to the introduction of commission caps and cuts by airlines. ^ The appearance of online retailers has given researchers the opportunity to compare the retailers 2 ̆ 7 offerings on the web and to characterize the way in which online retailers compete. The second chapter assesses the nature of competition among online <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> in an empirical study, specifically, it examines the role of product differentiation and price competition. The results indicate that product differentiation is still an important dimension in the competition among online <b>travel</b> <b>agents.</b> In the context of online <b>travel</b> <b>agents,</b> segmentation of customers through product differentiation appears to be the profit maximizing strategy. Further, we show that competition among online <b>travel</b> <b>agent</b> is not consistent with complete market transparency and pure price competition. ^ Further, an analysis of the offerings may also reveal previously hidden information about the relationship of the retailer to certain producers. The third chapter focuses on one potential explanation of the observed price dispersion for quoted ticket prices, namely hidden incentives from airlines or so called <b>travel</b> <b>agent</b> commission overrides. We find that the difference in prices of OTA recommendations can be partly explained by the difference in market share of the recommended airlines. Further, the difference in market share results in a greater price difference for the time-priority data set than for the price-priority data set. ^ Last, brick-and mortar <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> had to cope with a drastic change in the compensation structure. <b>Travel</b> <b>agents</b> faced pressure from two sides: drastically reduced commissions from airlines as well as the practice to rebate commissions to their clients.
