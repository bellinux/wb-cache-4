5|$|In {{intelligent}} mammals, such as primates, the cerebrum {{is larger}} {{relative to the}} rest of the brain. Intelligence itself is not easy to define, but indications of intelligence include the ability to learn, matched with behavioral flexibility. Rats, for example, are considered to be highly intelligent, as <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> and perform new tasks, an ability that may be important when they first colonize a fresh habitat. In some mammals, food gathering appears to be related to intelligence: a deer feeding on plants has a brain smaller than a cat, which must think to outwit its prey.|$|E
5|$|Most Pokémon {{evolve into}} other forms when certain {{conditions}} are met, {{such as when}} they reach a certain level—levels range from 1 to 100—or have a certain item used on them. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> up to four moves, including attacking moves, healing moves, and moves that inflict status conditions on the opponent. They have six stats that affect battle performance: maximum HP (hit points), Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. Attack and Special Attack are distinguished from Defense and Special Defense by the types of moves being considered: generally, moves involving physical exertion are physical, while moves involving supernatural or elemental powers are special. Moves are classed as one of seventeen types, (Normal, Water, Grass, Fire, Electric, Ghost, Bug, Fighting, Ice, Steel, Rock, Poison, Psychic, Dark, Dragon, Ground, and Flying); Pokémon can {{have one or two}} types. Generally, most of a Pokémon's moves correspond to its typing. A Pokémon's type makes it vulnerable or resistant to others; for example, Fire-type Pokémon are weak to Water-type moves, while Grass-type moves do little damage to them and Electric-type moves do normal damage.|$|E
5|$|The Paradigm {{system allows}} the player to program six {{different}} roles, which the characters can assume to perform certain formations in battle {{in response to}} specific conditions. The roles consist of Commando, which uses non-elemental attacks to stabilize the Chain Gauge; Ravager, which uses elemental attacks to fill the Chain Gauge; Medic, a White Mage-type role which can heal the party; Saboteur, which can weaken enemies; Synergist, which can strengthen allies; and Sentinel, which has protective abilities. The two main characters can initially assume three roles, but <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> others at the player's choosing as the game progresses. The player can select which roles the controlled character and the AI characters use while outside or during battle, {{which is the only}} way that the player can control the AI characters during a fight. The player can only choose from specific sets of paradigms that the player has set up before the battle. Monsters only have one role; different ones are used when the player switches paradigms. The player selects up to three monsters they wish to use in paradigms outside of battle. Unlike in Final Fantasy XIII, the player cannot summon the Eidolons, as the giant creatures were only available to the protagonists of that game.|$|E

25|$|Those who deliver {{training}} must exemplify both military {{skills and}} cultural sensitivity. While one's own country might consider searching after-action reviews a recognized learning experience, such techniques are counterproductive {{in countries where}} even one-on-one direct criticism is insulting, {{and even more so}} if criticism is delivered in front of third parties. Especially in intelligence and psychological operations, the FID and HN personnel should recognize <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> from one another.|$|E

Some species use fluorescent patterns {{on their bodies}} for signalling with their own and maybe even other species, expanding their range of behavioural signals. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> and remember well, {{and are able to}} recognise individual neighbours with whom they frequently interact. They can recognise them by visual signs and even by individual smell. Many have developed complex social behaviour to defend their space from rivals.|$|E

25|$|But a {{continuing}} emphasis to the well-rounded graduate {{can be seen}} in the University's approach to education degrees. As a solely graduate-level program, this is based on the principle that people need to learn primary subject matter well before <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> how to teach it to others. Thus future teachers at Lehigh often take a five-year program earning both a bachelor's degree in a specialized field and a master's degree in Education. This latter degree, along with the Business College's M.B.A., are among the most popular graduate programs in the University.|$|E
25|$|These {{results show}} that {{at the age of}} 6 months infants are {{sensitive}} to how often certain sounds occur in the language they are exposed to and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> which cues are important to pay attention to from these differences in frequency of occurrence. In natural language exposure this means typical sounds in a language (such as prevoiced /d/ in Spanish) occur often and infants can learn them from mere exposure to them in the speech they hear. All of this occurs before infants are aware of the meaning of any of the words they are exposed to, and therefore the phenomenon of statistical learning has been used to argue for the fact that infants can learn sound contrasts without meaning being attached to them.|$|E
25|$|The program {{offers an}} {{opportunity}} for students to develop an appreciation for different cultures and promotes greater understanding. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> a lot by asking questions directly to international students from various countries. Some local schools may request specific topics for volunteers to present about their country, especially if the students are learning it in class. If not, a simple PowerPoint with basic background information including geography, language, food, music, dance, sports, holidays, weather, and celebrations is sufficient. The content and depth of presentations depends on whether volunteers will be presenting to elementary, middle school or high school students or adults. Usually presentations will also include an activity for children to get involved such as learning a dance, song, game or several words and phrases in the language.|$|E

25|$|The party then learns of {{one last}} hope of {{stopping}} Melodia and Malpercio: the Magnus of Life. This power is {{counter to the}} End Magnus which currently empower Malpercio, and that this power was used to create Kalas and his brother, Fee. Kalas, however, was too human for Geldoblame's liking and only had one wing, so Geldoblame had ordered his termination. This leads Georg to blow up his laboratory with explosives and secretly flee to Mira with Kalas and Fee in tow. Due to being a creation of the Magnus of Life, however, Kalas is empowered by it, though he does not yet know how to tap into this power. The group decide to tie up some loose ends from their journey so <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> to harness the Magnus of Life's tremendous power. While they are doing this, it is decided that the islands shall launch a massive assault against Cor Hydrae's barrier. The purpose {{is to create a}} hole in it so Kalas' party can enter by flying the White Dragon into it.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} cadets {{choose the}} Citizen-Leader Track to pursue civilian careers or officer training or officer candidate training programs after graduation, or attend professional or graduate schools. Eighty-three {{percent of the}} Citizen-Leader Track cadets had a job or graduate school offer in hand upon graduation in May 2016. Recently, Northrop Grumman funded six scholarships for Citizen-Leader Track cadets or Military-Leader Track cadets not on scholarship which included an opportunity to intern with Northrop Grumman as well. Citizen-Leader Track cadets participate in an exercise called Job-Ex, where the junior and senior cadets learn to write a job description, freshman and sophomore cadets apply to those jobs, the upperclass cadets review them, and then they conduct panel interviews with the underclass cadets, so <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> from their peers what is successful in an job interview. The upperclass cadets learn what interviewers expect, so they can improve their interviewing skills as well. The Rice Center Board of Advisors, made up from executives from organizations like Northrop Grumman, Union Pacific, Dell, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigations, advise the Corps staff on curriculum and skill sets cadets need to develop to be more employable after graduation.|$|E
