5|$|Drugs {{are tested}} {{by the people who}} {{manufacture}} them, in poorly designed trials, on hopelessly small numbers of weird, unrepresentative patients, and analysed using techniques which are flawed by design, {{in such a way that}} they exaggerate the benefits of treatments. Unsurprisingly, these trials tend <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>results</b> that favour the manufacturer. When trials throw up results that companies don't like, they are perfectly entitled to hide them from doctors and patients, so we only ever see a distorted picture of any drug's true effects. Regulators see most of the trial data, but only from early on in a drug's life, and even then they don't give this data to doctors or patients, or even to other parts of government. This distorted evidence is then communicated and applied in a distorted fashion.|$|E

By Operation Charnwood's conclusion, Allied losses since 6 June had amounted to over 30,000 men, excluding {{those who had been}} evacuated due to sickness and those suffering from battle exhaustion. Buckley believes Charnwood to have been a good idea but one that proved better in concept than in execution, influenced as it was by the mounting political pressure on 21st Army Group <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>results.</b> Copp wrote that the broad-based assault plan across the entire front worked, preventing the Germans bringing to bear superior firepower on any one formation.|$|E
5|$|Antidiabetic {{therapy has}} been {{proposed}} {{as a treatment for}} polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition frequently associated with insulin resistance, since the late 1980s. The use of metformin in PCOS was first reported in 1994, in a small study conducted at the University of the Andes, Venezuela. The United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended in 2004 that women with PCOS and a body mass index above 25 be given metformin for anovulation and infertility when other therapies fail <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>results.</b> However, two clinical studies completed in 2006–2007 returned mostly negative results, with metformin performing no better than placebo, and a metformin-clomifene combination no better than clomifene alone. Reflecting this, subsequent reviews large randomized controlled trials in general have not shown the promise suggested by the early studies. UK and international clinical practice guidelines do not recommend metformin as a first-line treatment or do not recommend it at all, except for women with glucose intolerance. The guidelines suggest clomiphene as the first medication option and emphasize lifestyle modification independently from the drug treatment.|$|E

5|$|Arnold was {{disappointed}} with what XXIBomber Command had achieved, and wanted the Command <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>results</b> quickly. In addition, Hansell's preference for precision bombing {{was no longer}} in accordance with the views of the Twentieth Air Force headquarters, which wanted a greater emphasis on area attacks. In late December 1944 Arnold decided to relieve Hansell of his command. Seeing LeMay's success in improving XXBomber Command's performance, Arnold thought LeMay could solve the problems at XXIBomber Command, and replaced Hansell with him. Hansell was informed of Arnold's decision on 6January, but remained in his position until mid-January. During this period, XXIBomber Command conducted unsuccessful precision bombing attacks on the Musashino aircraft plant in Tokyo and a Mitsubishi Aircraft Works factory in Nagoya on 9 and 14January respectively. The last attack planned by Hansell was more successful, however: a force of 77 B-29s crippled a Kawasaki Aircraft Industries factory near Akashi on 19January. During XXIBomber Command's first three months of operations, it lost an average of 4.1% of aircraft dispatched in each raid.|$|E
5|$|Asche {{began the}} 2015 season among the team's hottest hitters, and a {{mainstay}} {{in the lineup}} as the team's starting third baseman. However, in late April, he began working on skills as an outfielder, ostensibly {{in preparation for the}} arrival of minor league prospect Maikel Franco, regarded as a stronger defensive third baseman. In fact, the Phillies optioned Asche back to Triple-A on May 12 to accelerate his development as a left fielder, as Franco was hitting very well in the minor leagues, and could be ready for a promotion. Although surprised and disappointed by the move, Asche sought to trust the organization and play wherever it needed him. Ultimately, Asche struggled to find playing time during the remainder of the season, although MLB.com writer Todd Zolecki said that Asche would be given an opportunity in 2016 as the Phillies like his makeup, but the burden will be on him <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>results</b> to justify the playing time, given the amelioration of other options at his positions.|$|E
5|$|Four of XXIBomber Command's {{next five}} raids were made against targets in Nagoya. The first {{two of these}} attacks on 13 and 18December used {{precision}} bombing tactics, and damaged the city's aircraft plants. The third raid was a daylight incendiary attack which was conducted after the Twentieth Air Force directed that 100 B-29s armed with M-69 bombs be dispatched against Nagoya to test {{the effectiveness of these}} weapons on a Japanese city. Hansell protested this order, as he believed that precision attacks were starting <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>results</b> and moving to area bombardment would be counterproductive, but agreed to the operation after he was assured that it did not represent a general shift in tactics. Despite the change in armament, the 22December raid was planned as a precision attack on an aircraft factory using only 78 bombers, and bad weather meant that little damage was caused. XXIBomber Command raided the Musashino aircraft plant in Tokyo again on 27December, but did not damage the facility. On 3January 1945, 97 B-29s were dispatched to conduct an area bombing raid on Nagoya. This attack started several fires, but these were quickly brought under control.|$|E

However, early in the 2006 season, Akins was purchased by Braun Racing, which switched the #38 from Dodge to Chevrolet bodies. Foyt had an exclusive contract with Dodge that prevented him from continuing with the team. After a week off, Ray Evernham found him a ride with FitzBradshaw Racing, but he failed to qualify for his first race with the team and has not attempted a NASCAR race since.|$|E

According to the FDA analysis of clinical trials venlafaxine caused a statistically significant 5-fold increase in suicidal ideation and behaviour in persons younger than 25. In another analysis, venlafaxine was no better than placebo among children (7–11 years old), but improved depression in adolescents (12–17 years old). However, in both groups, hostility and suicidal behaviour increased in comparison to those receiving a placebo. In a study involving antidepressants that had failed <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>results</b> in depressed teenagers, teens whose SSRI treatment had failed who were randomly switched to either another SSRI or to venlafaxine showed an increased rate of suicide on venlafaxine. Among teenagers who were suicidal {{at the beginning of}} the study, the rate of suicidal attempts and self-harm was significantly higher, by about 60%, after the switch to venlafaxine than after the switch to an SSRI.|$|E
25|$|Edison's major {{innovation}} was {{the establishment}} of an industrial research lab. It was built in Menlo Park, a part of Raritan Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey (today named Edison in his honor), with the funds from the sale of Edison's quadruplex telegraph. After his demonstration of the telegraph, Edison was not sure that his original plan to sell it for $4,000 to $5,000 was right, so he asked Western Union to make a bid. He was surprised to hear them offer $10,000 ($ in today's dollars.), which he gratefully accepted. The quadruplex telegraph was Edison's first big financial success, and Menlo Park became the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement. Edison was legally attributed with most of the inventions produced there, though many employees carried out research and development under his direction. His staff was generally told to carry out his directions in conducting research, and he drove them hard <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>results.</b>|$|E
