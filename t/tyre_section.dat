50|$|The Pirelli Cinturato may be {{compared}} to a wheel in which the rim {{is attached to the}} hub by means of fine spokes. The tread and belt are in effect the rim; the 90-degree or radial cord plies are the spokes; and the bead is the hub. The inextensible belt and the radial casing cords were the combined factors which gave the Cinturato tyre its special properties.The different geometric arrangement of the Cinturato carcass resulted in greater deformation (bulging) {{in the area of the}} <b>tyre</b> <b>section</b> which is under load, as opposed to previous radial tyres of the period. This caused no disadvantage and did not result in greater tyre casing fatigue. Rather than having the dynamic wave form behind the road contact area, it instead formed on the side wall, increasing stability whilst also allowing the heat generated by cornering and braking to be easily dispersed.|$|E
40|$|High value {{crops such as}} peas for {{the frozen}} {{vegetable}} market have to be harvested at the optimum point for quality, regardless of field conditions. Six wheeled pea harvesters with a gross weight of 27 t, giving a wheel load of 4. 5 t are required to move from field to field with optimum timeliness. In order to achieve road speeds of 25 km/h an inflation pressure of 2. 2 bar {{is required for the}} specific tyre load speed rating. Typically, in field conditions, this inflation pressure is not reduced and therefore the likelihood of soil damage is increased. This study was undertaken {{to examine the effects of}} <b>tyre</b> <b>section</b> width and inflation pressure on rolling resistance, rut depth and sub-surface soil deformation. Under controlled laboratory conditions three tyres, at three inflation pressures, with a load of 4. 5 t were passed over a soil at three different initial bulk densities. Measurements of dry bulk density, rut depth, rolling resistance, cone penetrometer resistance and soil deformation through the profile were taken before and after the passage of the tyres. The results show that by increasing the tyre size and reducing the inflation pressure the depth at which compaction occurs and rut depth decrease by 44 %. The 800 mm section tyre causes less compaction than any of the other tyres tested especially when inflated to 1. 6 bar. Rolling resistance is reduced when the tyre is inflated to the optimum for each tyre. The change in bulk density when plotted against either initial bulk density or penetration resistance results in a set of curves which can be used by the manufacturer, farmer or operator to select the correct <b>tyre</b> <b>section</b> width and inflation pressure for field conditions. As a result of this study the harvester manufacturers are investigating the engineering requirements of increasing <b>tyre</b> <b>section</b> width to 800 mm and are now equipping pea harvesters with central tyre inflation systems. The benefits of which would be to significantly reduce the amount of soil compaction, reduce rolling resistance and save the operator £ 455 000 per annum in fuel costs...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} is {{exploited}} the possibility to use two optical techniques and combining their measurements for the 3 D characterization of different tyres with {{particular attention to the}} <b>tyre's</b> <b>section.</b> Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (ESPI) and Laser Scanner (LS) based on principle of triangulation have been employed for investigating and studying the <b>tyre's</b> <b>section</b> and 3 D shape respectively. As case studies two different racing tyres, Michelin S 9 H and Pirelli Diablo respectively, have been considered. The investigation has been focused at the aim to evaluate and measure the section's components in order to add to the 3 D model obtained by Laser Scanning accurate information about the different layers along through the <b>tyres</b> <b>sections.</b> It {{is important to note that}} the assessment about the different layers along the section is a very difficult task to obtain by visual inspection or classical microscopy and even with the LS. Here we demonstrate that the different layers can be easily highlighted and identified by mean of the ESPI...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} process of a tyre usually involves {{a combination of}} simulation and testing techniques focused on characterizing acoustic/aerodynamic and vibrational phenomena. One of the acoustic phenomenon of interest is the absorption of the tyre, which affects the sound radiated. This properties is mainly related to local resonant effects, which can be changed by modifying the geometry of the tyre tread. A procedure is presented to determine the attenuation achieved due {{to a change in}} tyre tread configuration. The acoustic transfer path is measured from sound produced at one side of the tyre pavement contact area to the other. A miniature microphone and a small monopole with a known output have been developed to allow measurements inside the <b>tyre</b> grooves. <b>Tyre</b> <b>sections</b> with a circumferential groove only, as well as sections with additional side branches, have been evaluated...|$|R
50|$|In {{an effort}} to get the engine and gearbox to fit, some chassis {{triangulation}} was removed compared to that of the Grantura Mk 3, and various parts of the chassis were simply hammered until the drivetrain fitted. The brakes were not upgraded either, although slightly wider 185 <b>section</b> <b>tyres</b> were added.|$|R
50|$|The 'SPR' limited-edition racing {{homologation}} {{model has}} special factory parts including wide-mouthed TRM40 carbs, close-ratio gearbox, magnesium engine covers, alloy water pump, six-piston brake calipers, {{and a new}} braced swingarm. A wider rear wheel holding a wider 180 rear <b>section</b> <b>tyre</b> was also fitted. The 'SPR' was 10 kilos lighter than the WP.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the early}} {{motorcycle}} industry progressed, larger tyre sizes accompanied larger engine displacements, {{so that by}} 1909-1914, 2+1/4 in section, 26 in diameter tyres were used on [...] motorcycles, and 2+3/8 to 2+1/2 in <b>section</b> <b>tyres</b> appeared on motorcycles with displacements over 350 cc. Indian tyres reached 3.0 × 28 in, giving even greater rider comfort but with a taller seat height.|$|R
50|$|The {{chassis built}} of channel-section steel has {{cable-operated}} four-wheel brakes and it rides on half-elliptic springs. The 26-inch wire wheels take <b>tyres</b> of 3.50-inch <b>section.</b> (by December the car tested had 27 x 4.00-inch tyres) The car {{is to be}} complete with all accessories including an engine starter. The central brake lever works a transmission brake {{at the back of}} the gearbox. The bucket-type front seats are adjustable, the passenger's side folds and tips.|$|R
50|$|This Twelve shared {{much with}} Morris's 1292cc Ten Four and 1378cc Ten Six using the Ten Four gearbox and ratios but with wider wheels and larger <b>section</b> <b>tyres</b> {{than either of}} the smaller-engined cars and it used, with modifications, the {{wheelbase}} of the Ten Six which was six inches more than the Ten Four. The wheelbase was almost an inch longer than the Ten Six. It also had a fuel tank which held a gallon more than either of the other cars.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{modelling}} {{approach to}} predict the influence of road texture on the rolling resistance of car tyres is presented where the large static tyre deformations and the small texture induced tyre vibrations are treated separately. The energy dissipation due to the large continuous cyclic deformation of the <b>tyre</b> cross <b>section</b> for a treadless tyre subject to nominal load on a smooth road is determined in a non-linear steady-state rolling analysis on an FEM tyre model. The additional energy dissipation resulting from the contact forces and tyre vibrations due to the combined effect of the tread profile and the road texture, are determined based on a modal representation of the deformed tyre. The predicted rolling resistance coefficients are compared to experimental data. Although an offset in the absolute rolling resistance levels can be observed, the model predicts the correct trend regarding the increase of rolling resistance with increasing texture depth...|$|R
50|$|Fully {{chromium-plated}} bumpers {{were provided}} {{instead of the}} previous black and chromium edged type and the standardization of Magna type wheels with large <b>section</b> <b>tyres</b> helped {{the appearance of the}} car. The instrument board and other interior woodwork were redesigned. The windscreen was centrally controlled and was given dual wipers working from the bottom. The rear quarter windows were hinged to open. The upholstery was redesigned and could be had in all leather or in a combination of cloth and leather. The spare wheel was covered and there was a wide range of new colour schemes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine was}} part of a single {{assembly}} including its clutch and gearbox. This assembly was held at three points in [...] "live rubber" [...] with a steadying bearing forward of the flywheel. Suspension was by long semi-elliptic springs at each corner of the car controlled by Luvax shock absorbers combined with a front (anti-roll) torsion bar. The chassis was mounted on large <b>section</b> <b>tyres.</b> Spare wheel and tyre were stowed in a separate compartment below the luggage locker. Permanent hydraulic jacks were built into the chassis. Both springs and frame pass beneath the back axle.|$|R
