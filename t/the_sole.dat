5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sole</b> Survivor investigates a pre-War {{amusement}} park, Nuka-World, when radio advertisements are broadcast {{into the}} Commonwealth. Porter Gage, a veteran raider, contacts <b>the</b> <b>Sole</b> Survivor after boarding a monorail and tells {{them that they}} are walking into a death trap. Upon arrival, <b>the</b> <b>Sole</b> Survivor must navigate an increasingly-deadly obstacle course called the Gauntlet, which culminates in a fight with the raider leader, Overboss Colter. Gage reveals that the fight is rigged as Colter is wearing invulnerable electrically-charged armor, and that no-one survives the Gauntlet. Gage aids <b>the</b> <b>Sole</b> Survivor by helping them exploit the Achilles heel in Colter's armor, becoming the first person to survive the Gauntlet. Following the death of Colter, Gage explains the leaders of the three raider gangs conspired to usurp him, using the broadcast and the Gauntlet to find possible replacements. <b>The</b> <b>Sole</b> Survivor is offered to become the Overboss, but must balance the competing needs of each gang of raiders while conquering the outlying areas of the park. Once the entire park is under raider control, <b>the</b> <b>Sole</b> Survivor sets about expanding raider influence in the Commonwealth by conquering settlements, restoring power to Nuka-World to make the park self-sufficient, and thwarting attempts by the Gunnersa band of amoral mercenariesto seize control of Nuka-World for themselves.|$|E
