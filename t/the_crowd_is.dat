5|$|The {{graphics}} {{themselves were}} considered to be three-dimensional given the constraints of the technology at the time. All the players are Caucasian and each one's batting stance is exactly the same. The game view is always top down; when batting or pitching, it is centered above the catcher, behind the batter and with an overhead look of the pitcher. In the outfield, there is an aerial view of a portion of the field, with the team members represented by tiny sprites and an inset with red dots representing where the players are on base. Although the official colors are intact, the actual symbols on their uniforms are absent. <b>The</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>is</b> represented by a series of colored dots, while the dugouts are represented by plain white parallelograms.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>is</b> {{notoriously}} loud during Seahawks games. It {{has twice}} held the Guinness World Record for loudest crowd roar {{at an outdoor}} stadium, first at 136.6 decibels in 2013, followed by a measurement of 137.6 decibels in 2014. Both records were eventually broken by crowds at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. The current record was set by fans at Arrowhead on September 29, 2014, in a Monday Night Football game against the New England Patriots, hitting 142.2 decibels. The noise {{has contributed to the}} team's home field advantage with an increase in false start (movement by an offensive player prior to the play) and delay of game (failure of the offense to snap the ball prior to the play clock expiring) penalties against visiting teams. The stadium was the first in the NFL to implement a FieldTurf artificial field. Numerous college and high school American football games have also been played at the stadium.|$|E

5|$|To create 2,000 Hun {{soldiers}} {{during the}} Huns' attack sequence, the production team developed crowd simulation software called Attila. This software allows thousands of unique characters to move autonomously. A {{variant of the}} program called Dynasty {{was used in the}} final battle sequence to create a crowd of 3,000 in the Forbidden City. Pixar's photorealistic open API RenderMan was used to render the crowd. Another software developed for this movie was Faux Plane, which was used to add depth to flat two-dimensional painting. Although developed late in production progress, Faux Plane was used in five shots, including the dramatic sequence which features the Great Wall of China, and the final battle sequence when Mulan runs to the Forbidden City. During the scene in which the Chinese are bowing to Mulan, <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>is</b> a panoramic film of real people bowing. It was edited into the animated foreground of the scene.|$|E

25|$|The word koladera {{initially}} {{referred to}} the act of going out and singing the colá. According to the oral tradition, a new musical genre appeared in the 1930s when the composer Anton’ Tchitch’ intentionally speeded up the tempo of a morna. Someone in <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>is</b> said to have shouted “já Bocê v’rá-’l n’um coladêra” (you have transformed it in a coladeira), i.e., a morna performed with the tempo and liveliness of a koladera. Technically, the coladeira appeared as a division in half {{of the length of}} the notes of the morna, through the acceleration of the tempo.|$|E
25|$|The {{people are}} {{gathered}} at the square to watch the executions. <b>The</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>is</b> restless. Koroghlu's struggle for freedom has infused people with courage. People are protesting and loudly curse the khan. They receive the convicted persons with empathy; beautiful Nigar stands motionless on the scaffold {{with the support of}} her friends. She is the first to be executed. Hassan khan appears and orders the execution to begin. There is no fear in the courageous heart of Nigar. She angrily blames the khan. At that moment when the executioner' readies his axe Koroghlu's soldiers burst into the square and set the convicted free. It is the men who ordered the executions who receive the punishment. The people greet Koroghlu with delight..|$|E
25|$|The prize contest begins. Beckmesser {{attempts}} {{to sing the}} verses that he had obtained from Sachs. However, he garbles the words (Morgen ich leuchte) and fails to fit them to an appropriate melody, and ends up singing so clumsily that the crowd laughs him off. Before storming off in anger, he yells that the song was not even his: Hans Sachs tricked him into singing it. <b>The</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>is</b> confused. How could the great Hans Sachs have written such a bad song? Sachs tells them that the song is not his own, and also {{that it is in}} fact a beautiful song which the masters will love when they hear it sung correctly. To prove this, he calls a witness: Walther. The people are so curious about the song (correctly worded as Morgenlich leuchtend im rosigen Schein) that they allow Walther to sing it, and everyone is won over in spite of its novelty.|$|E

25|$|History was {{repeated}} on 4 October 2015 when {{for only the}} second time in the NRL's history, no NSW team was in the grand final and for the first time ever, it was a Queensland derby in the final between Brisbane and North Queensland. 82,758 people, many of whom had travelled down from various parts of Queensland, witnessed one of the all-time great grand finals when the game went into Golden Point time courtesy of a Kyle Feldt try in the dying moments to level the scores at 16 all. But the game would be remembered for Ben Hunt's dropped ball from the kick-off to extra time which led to Johnathan Thurston's field goal that gave North Queensland their first ever premiership in the NRL since being admitted into the competition in 1995. Apart from games involving national teams, <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>is</b> the largest ever in NSW not to involve a team based in the state.|$|E
25|$|Charlotte Corday {{arrives in}} Paris at dawn. In a square she meets Camille, her {{childhood}} friend, now a deputy to the National Convention. He is disappointed, defeated, and fears for his life. Amongst <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>is</b> Gaston, who tells Charlotte {{that he is}} the bodyguard and faithful friend of Marat. Their conversation is interrupted by a commotion which arises around a bakery. In play, a group of children act out the events of the Revolution. The square slowly empties out, except for a child who is left behind by his playmates, tied up as a victim. Charlotte releases and comforts him, thereby building up courage herself, then she buys a long-bladed knife and a shawl from a pedlar. Marat arrives surrounded by an adulating crowd which, at the same time, notices his fatigue and ill-health. Charlotte attracts his attention for a moment, then he continues on to the hall of the Convention. She does not know how {{to take advantage of the}} situation to kill him. Marat, received by the deputies with a mixture of hostility and respect, addresses the assembly.|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} {{prior to the}} Japanese leg of the tour, percussionist Shawn Crahan discussed the difference between Japanese audiences and Western audiences.

[...] However, he did note that between songs can be [...] "very awkward" [...] because <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>is</b> almost silent, whereas the band is used to a more energetic reception.|$|E

500|$|The music adds {{a second}} violin {{line and a}} snare drum cadence. At 0:25, a young man {{performs}} a [...] "rock the cradle" [...] slam dunk. At 0:29, a young man recreates Jordan's free throw line dunk from the [...] 1988 NBA All-Star Game Slam Dunk Contest. This is the only shot where the original scenery is imitated. The set colors match {{the colors of the}} Chicago Stadium, and <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>is</b> spaced out {{in the same way as}} the crowd during Jordan's dunk; they nevertheless wear modern clothes, as the ad is set in the present. The intent is that by this point, the viewer is aware of the significance of each shot. Waterbury said, [...] "We built the action in a way so that it created tension in the spot.

[...] Outraged at Harvard's poor acting skills, Wang takes the stage in his place, his stage instincts take over ("Gliding Through My Memories"), and he is soon an enthusiastic supporter of the change, taking the stage name Sammy Fong. [...] Linda advises Mei-li to put on one of her old stripper dresses to attract Ta, but the stratagem backfires, since Ta is attracted to Mei-li because of her wholesomeness.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the competitive games, one of <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> favorites <b>is</b> <b>the</b> exhibitions of sheep herding with border collies on the playing field. <b>The</b> <b>crowds</b> <b>are</b> often delighted by the skill of the border collies that herd the sheep across the field and into a penned area.|$|R

500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Balans" [...] {{was directed by}} Anton San and released onto Stan's YouTube channel on 2 March 2016; by May 2016, the clip amassed over one million views. The clip was filmed in an abandoned warehouse or a polygon where the inside temperature was of 6°C. About the video, Stan particularly confessed that [...] " [...] is very dinamic and colored, {{the way that the}} life of a pop artist looks like." [...] The clip commences with Stan standing on a pickup, with fellow background dancers being present inside the car. Following their leaving, she looks from above at a partying crowd in a hall, which appears to be halfway filled with water, while sporting pink and red clothing. Subsequently, Stan is displayed dressing a pink fur coat and pants, while walking in the surroundings and finally discovering Mohombi. Following this, he provides his singing part when flirting with Stan, with her dancing around him. Following this, <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>is</b> once again shown dancing together to the song, and the clip closes with Stan being left alone in the room. Scenes interspersed through the main video show her posing in front of a blue wall or her lying atop the pickup car, with her head being placed on a golden purse. Italian publication RnB Junk writer, Umberto Olivio, criticized the clip for not having a plot and for being [...] "unrealistic".|$|E
500|$|On game night, coach Taylor gives a {{pep talk}} where he warns the players against taking the opponents – Westerby High School – too lightly. They say their {{rallying}} cry, [...] "Clear Eyes, Full Hearts, Can't Lose!" [...] and enter the field. The first half is problematic for the Panthers, {{and at the end}} of the second half, the visitors make a potentially game-winning interception. Street is the only one left to make a tackle. He succeeds, but the tackle is so hard that he remains prone on the ground. <b>The</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>is</b> left in silence as the starting quarterback does not move, and has to be taken off on a stretcher to a waiting ambulance. Coach Taylor now has to put in the highly unprepared Saracen, who initially makes several silly mistakes. The coach tells him to relax and focus, and Saracen manages to connect with Smash, who scores a touchdown. Riggins recovers the ensuing onside kick for the Panthers. In the final seconds of the game, Saracen throws a long pass to a receiver, who makes it to the end zone for another touchdown. As the Panthers win the game, both teams gather at mid-field to pray for Jason Street. Team members then head over to the hospital, where Street's condition is still unclear. Riggins and Smash reconcile, while Julie tries to comfort Lyla. In a voice-over, coach Taylor is heard saying that [...] "We are all vulnerable, and we will all at some point in our lives fall." ...|$|E
