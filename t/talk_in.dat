5|$|Billy and Frank stopped {{first at}} the Grand Hotel on Allen Street, and were greeted by Doc Holliday.

Angrily, Frank {{said he would not}} drink, and he and Billy left the saloon immediately to seek Tom. By law, both Frank and Billy should have left their firearms at the Grand Hotel. Instead, they remained fully armed.|$|E

She is often seen sucking on her red pacifier and, when she walks, she trips over her clothing and falls on her face (this running gag is used much more in earlier seasons). Being an infant, she cannot talk. She is a counterpart to Lisa Simpson. However, she did appear to <b>talk</b> <b>in</b> the first Tracey Ullman Show short.|$|E

5|$|A {{couple of}} days before the Varsity Match, <b>talk</b> <b>in</b> the press had been of Geen's likely {{selection}} for England for the forthcoming Home Nations Championship. Geen and Poulton, who together were considered the scoring force of the Oxford team, were both selected to play for England in the second trial match against The North in Leeds. Although Geen scored a try in the game, his form was lacking and he was outshone by Poulton. So for the third and final trial, England versus The Rest on 7 January 1911, Geen was not selected.|$|E

5|$|In the 1840s, {{tensions}} {{were growing}} between the North and South over various issues including slavery. The Wilmot Proviso, introduced in 1846, contributed to these tensions; if passed, {{it would have}} banned slavery in any land acquired from Mexico. The Compromise of 1850 brought a temporary respite, but the Dred Scott case, decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1857, spurred public debate. Chief Justice Roger Taney ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional and that African Americans had no standing as citizens under the constitution. Northerners were outraged and there was increasing <b>talk</b> <b>in</b> the South of secession from the Union.|$|E

5|$|In {{the week}} {{leading up to}} the 25th, French, German, and British {{soldiers}} crossed trenches to exchange seasonal greetings and <b>talk.</b> <b>In</b> some areas, men from both sides ventured into no man's land on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day to mingle and exchange food and souvenirs. There were joint burial ceremonies and prisoner swaps, while several meetings ended in carol-singing. Men played games of football (soccer) with one another, giving {{one of the most memorable}} images of the truce. Peaceful behavior was not ubiquitous; fighting continued in some sectors, while in others the sides settled on little more than arrangements to recover bodies.|$|E

5|$|Right {{after signing}} the {{contract}} with the Canadiens, Morenz began to reconsider joining them. Stratford residents, {{as well as his}} senior team, wanted him to stay, and Morenz yielded to the pressure. He wrote a letter in August to Dandurand, explaining that he could not leave Stratford, and included the cheque given to him as a signing bonus. After receiving the letter, Dandurand phoned Morenz and told him to come to Montreal to <b>talk</b> <b>in</b> person. In Montreal, Morenz began explaining his reasons for not signing to Dandurand but began crying and could not finish. In response, Dandurand falsely threatened that if Morenz did not join the Canadiens, his professional hockey career would be over. Hearing this, Morenz relented and agreed to report to the Canadiens' training camp later in the year.|$|E

Responding to widespread interest, Dr. Tripp gave a <b>talk</b> <b>in</b> 1963 at the Fifty-third Annual Meeting of the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America on Development of Leadership in Boy Leaders of Boys. In August 1963, a patrol of Scouts from the San Mateo County Council and a few boys from the Circle Ten Council in Dallas attended White Stag summer camp at Camp Pico Blanco. The program was observed and evaluated by Ken Wells (national director of Research) and John Larson (staff researcher). Wells had a long history with Wood Badge, beginning as a participant in the second United States Wood Badge course in 1948. They were impressed by the program.|$|E
5|$|Michael {{tries to}} {{introduce}} another murder and other twists {{to the story}} to pull his staff back into the party. This infuriates Jim to his breaking point, and they hold a private <b>talk</b> <b>in</b> Michael's office. Michael snaps at Jim and points out that he is doing this to keep the office calm. CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) finally returns the phone calls to Jim, and reveals that while nothing has been officially decided yet, Dunder Mifflin {{is expected to be}} insolvent by year-end. Jim hides the news from the staff and nudges them back into the party. Jim finally realizes that Michael was doing this to help his co-workers cope. At the end of the episode, Michael, Dwight, Andy, and Pam find themselves in a fake Mexican standoff lasting until 6:00 at night. Jim pulls Pam out so they can go home, and the others pretend to shoot each other to death.|$|E
5|$|Pope Paul III claimed some {{rights in}} Klis, and in September, 1536, there was <b>talk</b> <b>in</b> the Curia of {{strengthening}} the defenses of the fortress. The Pope notified Ferdinand {{that he was}} willing to share the costs of maintaining a proper garrison in Klis. Ferdinand I did send aid to Klis and was apparently hopeful of holding the fortress, when the Turks again laid siege to it. Ferdinand I recruited men from Trieste and elsewhere in the Habsburg lands, and Pope Paul III sent soldiers from Ancona. There were about 3,000 infantry in the reinforcements, which made a sizeable relief force, that were commanded by Petar Kružić, Niccolo dalla Torre, and a papal commissioner Jacomo Dalmoro d'Arbe. On March 9, 1537, they disembarked near Klis, at a place called S. Girolamo, with fourteen pieces of artillery. After Ibrahim's death, Suleiman the Magnificent sent 8,000 men under the command of Murat-beg Tardić (Amurat Vaivoda), a Croatian renegade who had been born in Šibenik, to go and lay siege to Klis fortress (Clissa), and fight against Petar Kružić. An initial encounter of the Christian relief force with the Turks was indecisive, but, on March 12, they were overwhelmed by the arrival of a great number of Turks.|$|E

5|$|Writer Damon Lindelof {{conceived}} Peter Weyland as a {{man with}} a massive ego and a god complex. During the film's early development director Ridley Scott intended Max von Sydow to play Weyland, but he began to favor Guy Pearce when a scene was written with a younger version of the character. To depict Weyland's aging, Pearce wore heavy prosthetics requiring five hours to apply and one hour to remove. The actor worked to replicate the speech patterns and movements of an elderly man. Although Weyland's younger version was omitted from Prometheus final screenplay, the film marketed the character with a fictional, futuristic TED <b>talk</b> <b>in</b> which Pearce appears without prosthetics. His performance was generally negatively received because of the unconvincing prosthetics and the casting of a 44-year-old actor as a 103-year-old man. However, the Weyland Industries web campaign was recognized by the Key Art Awards. In October 2016, it was reported that Pearce would be reprising his role as a younger version of Weyland in Alien: Covenant.|$|E
