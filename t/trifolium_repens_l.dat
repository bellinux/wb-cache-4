5000|$|Clovers {{can have}} more than four leaves. Five-leaf clovers are less {{commonly}} found naturally than four-leaf clovers; however, they, too, have been successfully cultivated. Some four-leaf clover collectors, particularly in Ireland, regard the five-leaf clover, known as a rose clover, as a particular prize. In exceptionally rare cases, clovers are able to grow with [...] and more in nature. The most leaves ever found on a single clover stem (<b>Trifolium</b> <b>repens</b> <b>L.)</b> is 56 and was discovered by Shigeo Obara of Hanamaki City, Iwate, Japan, on 10 May 2009.|$|E

40|$|Arbuscular fungi have a {{major role}} in {{directing}} the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems yet little is known about their biogeographical distribution. The Baas-Becking hypothesis (‘everything is everywhere, but, the environment selects’) was tested by investigating the distribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) at the landscape scale and the influence of environmental factors and geographical distance in determining community composition. AMF communities in <b>Trifolium</b> <b>repens</b> and Lolium perenne roots were assessed in 40 geographically dispersed sites in Ireland representing different land uses and soil types. Field sampling and laboratory bioassays were used, with AMF communities characterised using 18 S rRNA terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Landscape-scale distribution of AMF was driven by the local environment. AMF community composition was influenced by abiotic variables (pH, rainfall and soil type), but not land use or geographical distance. <b>Trifolium</b> <b>repens</b> and <b>L.</b> perenne supported contrasting communities of AMF, and the communities colonising each plant species were consistent across pasture habitats and over distance. Furthermore, L. perenne AMF communities grouped by soil type within pasture habitats. This is the largest and most comprehensive study that has investigated the landscape-scale distribution of AMF. Our findings support the Baas-Becking hypothesis at the landscape scale and demonstrate the strong influence the local environment has on determining AMF community composition...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} sources of pollen for the honeybee in the Bojanów forest complex, Nowa Dęba Forest District (southeastern Poland). Sampling of pollen loads from bees extended from the beginning of May until the end of September 2016 and was carried out at 7 -day intervals using pollen traps mounted at the entrance of beehives. A total of 73 pollen load samples were collected from the study area. Fifty-nine taxa from 31 plant families were identified in the analyzed material. From 4 to 21 taxa (average 9. 5) were recorded in one sample. The pollen of Brassicaceae (“others”), Taraxacum type, Solidago type, and Rumex had the highest frequency in the pollen loads examined. Apart from these four taxa, pollen grains of Rubus type, Poaceae (“others”), Calluna, Fagopyrum, <b>Trifolium</b> <b>repens</b> s. <b>l.,</b> Phacelia, Aster type, Melampyrum, Quercus, Cornus, and Veronica were recorded in the dominant pollen group. The forest habitat taxa that provided pollen rewards to honeybees in the Bojanów forest complex were the following: Rubus, Calluna, Prunus, Tilia, Frangula alnus, Pinus, Quercus, Cornus, Robinia pseudoacacia, Salix, and Vaccinium. Apart from forest vegetation, the species from meadows and wastelands adjacent to this forest complex, represented by Taraxacum, Rumex, Plantago, Poaceae, <b>Trifolium</b> <b>repens,</b> and Solidago, proved to be an important source of pollen. The study indicates that forest communities are a valuable source of pollen for pollinating insects from early spring through to late fall...|$|R

(Vol. 19, pp. 350 - 352). IBERS, Aberystwyth UniversityThe potential of grasslands to deliver ecosystem services and mitigate some of the impacts of climate change is increasingly being recognised. Backcross hybrids between the stoloniferous <b>Trifolium</b> <b>repens</b> <b>L.,</b> and the related rhizomatous species T. ambiguum M. Bieb have been produced using T. repens as the recurrent parent. The differences between parental species and the backcrosses in root morphology were studied in 1 m long pipes.

The backcrosses exhibited root characteristics intermediate between the parents. The extent to which such differences in root architecture may influences soil structure and deliver ecosystem services is discussed...|$|E

The genetic {{location}} of the self-incompatibility locus in white clover (<b>Trifolium</b> <b>repens</b> <b>L.)</b> Theoretical and Applied Genetics, 121, (3), 567 - 576. White clover (<b>Trifolium</b> <b>repens</b> <b>L.)</b> is a forage legume of considerable economic importance in temperate agricultural systems with a strong self-incompatibility system. The molecular basis of self-incompatibility in T. repens is unknown, but it is {{under the control of}} a single locus which is expressed gametophytically. To locate the self-incompatibility locus (S locus) in T. repens, we carried out cross-pollination experiments in an F 1 mapping population and constructed a genetic linkage map using amplified fragment length polymorphism and simple sequence repeat markers. As {{the first step in a}} map-based cloning strategy, we locate for the first time the S locus in T. repens on a genetic linkage map, on the homoeologous linkage group pair 1 (E), which is broadly syntenic to Medicago truncatula L. chromosome 1. On the basis of this syntenic relationship, the possibility that the S locus may or may not possess an S-RNase gene is discussed. Peer reviewe...|$|E
