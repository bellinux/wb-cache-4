5|$|When Storm's father died, he {{returned}} from Amsterdam to Liverpool <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> mother at Stormsville, at 54 Broad Green Road, Broadgreen, Liverpool. On 27 September 1972, Storm developed a chest infection and could not sleep properly, so he took sleeping pills. The next day Storm and his mother were both found dead. A post mortem determined that Storm had not taken enough pills to kill himself, but it was suspected that, after finding her son's body, his mother had died.|$|E
5|$|He and Doctor Phlox then tend to Porthos, and Archer {{spends the}} night in Sickbay <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> pet. Throughout the night, as Porthos' immune system weakens, Archer {{experiences}} Phlox's side of life in Sickbay. During the night, as he dreams of Porthos' funeral, Archer also deals with unresolved and suppressed sexual tension with T'Pol. He also relates to Phlox how he met Porthos, {{and how he was}} the last in a litter of four male puppies, the 'Four Musketeers'. Through it all, Archer struggles to reach an emotional understanding with Phlox and T'Pol, as the two alien senior-crew members have little grasp of the human-pet relationship, and Phlox keeps offering Archer unsolicited advice about dealing with his apparent feelings for T'Pol.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, {{at the age}} of 26, O'Brien {{collapsed}} on stage during a performance, and later died due to complications after an appendicitis operation. Storm disbanded the Hurricanes and became a disc jockey, working at the Silver Blades Ice Rink in Liverpool, in Benidorm (he was also a water-skiing instructor there) in Jersey and Amsterdam. When Storm's father died, he returned from Amsterdam to Liverpool <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> mother. He developed a chest infection and could not sleep properly, so he took sleeping pills. On 28 September 1972, Storm and his mother were both found dead, at Stormsville. The post mortem revealed that Storm had alcohol and sleeping pills in his blood (as had his mother) but not enough to cause his death, which was ruled accidental. Although it could not be proven, it is thought that his mother had committed suicide after finding Storm's body.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after his}} autumn 1795 {{marriage}} to Sara Fricker, Coleridge left {{their home in}} Clevedon, North Somerset. However, he felt guilt at his absence from his wife, and eventually {{went to live with}} her family at Redcliffe Hill, Bristol. As he completed The Eolian Harp—composed to commemorate his return to Clevedon—Coleridge composed Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement on his absence from Clevedon and later return <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> wife at Bristol. The poem was published in the October 1796 Monthly Magazine, under the title Reflections on Entering into Active Life. A poem Which Affects Not to be Poetry. Reflections was included in Coleridge's 28 October 1797 collection of poems and the anthologies that followed.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, Lindemann {{may have}} left his combat {{position}} when the ship's controls were rendered inoperable, and {{prior to the}} lethal hit on the command position, {{in order to give}} the command to abandon the ship. The surviving Matrose Paul Hillen—who had managed to escape to the upper deck in the final phase of the battle, stated that he had seen a group of 20–30 people standing at the bow, among them a man with a white peaked cap. Normally on a German naval vessel at sea, a white cap is worn only by the commanding officer. In addition, the surviving Maschinengefreiter—Rudolf Römer, who at the time was already in the water—claimed that he had seen Lindemann standing on the bow, near Bismarcks forward 38cm turret, Anton. He was said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> combat messenger, a leading seaman, and apparently trying to persuade his messenger to save himself. In this account, his messenger took Lindemann's hand and the two walked to the forward flagmast. As the ship turned over, the two stood briefly to attention, then Lindemann and his messenger saluted. As the ship rolled to port, the messenger fell into the water. Lindemann continued his salute while clinging to the flagmast, going under with the ship.|$|E
5|$|However, Boston's {{chances of}} getting Russell seemed slim. Because the Celtics had {{finished}} second in the previous season and the worst teams had the highest draft picks, the Celtics had slipped too low in the draft order to pick Russell. In addition, Auerbach had already used his territorial pick to acquire talented forward Tom Heinsohn. But Auerbach knew that the Rochester Royals, who owned the first draft pick, already had a skilled rebounder in Maurice Stokes, were looking for an outside shooting guard and were unwilling to pay Russell the $25,000 signing bonus he requested. The St. Louis Hawks, who owned the second pick, drafted Russell, but were vying for Celtics center Ed Macauley, a six-time All-Star who had roots in St. Louis. Auerbach agreed to trade Macauley, who had previously asked to be traded to St. Louis in order <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> sick son, if the Hawks gave up Russell. The owner of St Louis called Auerbach later and demanded more in the trade. Not only did he want Macauley, who was the Celtics premier player at the time, he wanted Cliff Hagan, who had been serving in the military for three years and had not yet played for the Celtics. After much debate, Auerbach agreed to give up Hagan, and the Hawks made the trade.|$|E
