50|$|The MC-71 {{is a large}} egg-shaped {{antitank mine}} that uses a shaped charge that {{consists}} of two truncated cones, that are placed back to back. The shaped charge uses a copper liner, and the body is metallic, making the MC-71 readily detectable by a metal detector. The lower cone contains the explosive shaped-charge and the detonator. The upper assembly functions as a cover intended only to allow better formation of the charge jet. The mine is initiated by a <b>tiltrod</b> assembly which is driven into the ground near the mine. Firing is through a detonating cable connecting {{the base of the}} <b>tiltrod</b> assembly to the detonator.|$|E
