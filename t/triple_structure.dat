50|$|The {{link between}} the right hand and the {{discussion}} of adultery is somewhat unclear. In Jewish writings {{of the time it}} was common to have a foot, hand, eye <b>triple</b> <b>structure.</b> This full <b>triple</b> <b>structure</b> is seen in the similar discussions at Mark 9:43-47, and a version much closer to that in Mark appears at Matthew 18:8-9. Jesus here uses two thirds of the structure, the first reference to the eye is clearly linked to his previous statement that looking at a woman lustfully is sinful, but it is uncertain why he continues to the hand when he specifically stated that action and touching is not required for sin. Hill feels that this might be related to theft. At the time the law saw adultery as a form of theft, as it was taking another man's wife. The right hand, the more active of the two among most of the population, had long been metaphorically associated with theft. An alternate view, that has been adopted by some in recent years, is that the mention of a hand linked to lust is a reference to masturbation. In the New Testament this is the verse most often cited to condemn that practice. A third view is to see this verse connected less to the previous verses, and more as part of the discussion of divorce that takes up the next two verses. This argument states that the cutting off of the sinful hand is a metaphor for separation from a sinful spouse, even if it causes great pain.|$|E

50|$|However {{there are}} several other people who were left out of the genealogy. Matthew 1:8 skips over Ahaziah, Athaliah, Jehoash, and Amaziah, two of whom were kings of Judah and all are well {{documented}} by other sources. Begat can also mean grandfather of and skipping unimportant generations is not uncommon in ancient genealogies. See Matthew 1:8 for a full discussion on why these four may have been left out. It is, however, somewhat duplicitous to claim that there were fourteen generations when in fact there were eighteen. Fowler argues that this verse is not in error, as it is not a description of the actual genealogy, but simply of the list that was presented in the Gospel. Fowler believes that the author of Matthew had good reason to drop the names he did and to skip unnecessary ancestors. Fowler sees instructions in this verse are to aid in the memorization of Matthew's version of the genealogy, not the historical list of decedents. By tradition the first period from Abraham to David always had fourteen names, so the author of Matthew simply cut unneeded names from the other two sections to create an easily memorized <b>triple</b> <b>structure.</b>|$|E

The two monomeric dyes ethidium bromide and propidium iodide are shown to behave similarly {{to each other}} in intercalating into and stabilizing both the duplex and the <b>tripler</b> <b>structures.</b> However, contrary to expectations, the extra cationic side-chain of propidium iodide provides no significant extra stabilization of tripler compared with ethidium bromide, although propidium does stabilize the duplex more than ethidium. The monomeric dyes appear to have somewhat different binding geometries with the duplex and tripler polymers. The dimeric dye ethidium homodimer is found to bis-intercalate in the tripler as well as the duplex but, in contrast to the monomers, no variation in geometry between duplex and tripler is observed. However, although dimer stabilizes the duplex, it has no effect on the thermal stability of the tripler.

This allows time analyses near the Nyquist frequency (2 days) which is used {{for a study of}} the quasi 2 day wave (QTDW) in summer. The well-known maximum near solstice is observed. In addition, there are two unexpected side maxima about 45 - 60 days before and after the center peak. A similar triplet is seen in the QTDW analysis of Microwave Limb Sounder temperature data. The <b>triple</b> <b>structure</b> is also found in a very similar form 15 years earlier in the interval 1988 - 1993 in early Wuppertal data. In these 15 years the time distance between the first and last triple peak has increased by about 22 days.

40|$|Binding of RecA protein to {{conventional}} anti-parallel poly(dA). 2 poly(dT) tripler DNA {{has been studied}} using flow linear dichroism spectroscopy. The association requires the presence of cofactor analog adenosine 5 '-O- 3 -thiotriphosphate (ATP gamma S) and occurs with a rate similar to that for the association of RecA to double-stranded poly(dA) poly(dT) DNA. The binding of RecA to DNA stiffens the nucleotide chain, as evidenced from high orientation already at low shear rates, and the complex with tripler DNA appears {{to be at least}} as stiff as that with the duplex DNA. Therefore, the observation of a lower magnitude of the LD spectrum at 260 nm, in the triplex-RecA compared to the duplex-RecA complex, but retained magnitude of protein LD at 280 nm, indicates a markedly impaired orientation of nucleo-bases, possibly reflecting a perturbation by RecA on the third strand making its bases deviate strongly from perpendicularity. The circular dichroism spectrum: appearing immediately after dissociation of RecA by SDS, suggests an intact <b>tripler</b> <b>structure,</b> meaning that complexation with RecA has not dissociated the third strand. In conclusion, binding of RecA to tripler DNA does not modify the main organisation of the strands, but could affect the base-base interactions between them. Tilted bases could reflect a conformational change that RecA imposes also on the biological intermediate <b>tripler</b> <b>structure</b> to relax the base-base hydrogen bonding between the DNA strands...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to quantify the relationship between secondary structure of gelatin and its adsorption at the fish-oil/water interface and to quantify the implication of the adsorption on the dynamic interfacial tension (DST) and emulsion stability. The surface hydrophobicity of the gelatin solutions decreased when the pH increased from 4. 0 to 6. 0, while opposite tend was observed in the viscosity of the solution. The DST values decreased as the pH increased from 4. 0 to 6. 0, indicating that higher positive charges (measured trough zeta potential) in the gelatin solution tended to result in higher DST values. The adsorption kinetics of the gelatin solution was examined through the calculated diffusion coefficients (Des).

The addition of NaOH decreased the beta-turn and increased the a-helix and random coil.
