5|$|The {{way that}} leads to the abyss for the German people has now come. The party patriots {{continue}} ever to believe and hope. Also, there are still those who do not want to see, and they expect a miracle from the Führer. Those are {{the kind of people who}} do not give up hope even at the edge of the grave. In all other respects, the number of peace seekers grows from hour to hour. The coming generations, and the foreign countries, will want to understand why the German people themselves did not turn against the party tyranny and stop the Nazi Party leaders by force in order to terminate this horrible war. For <b>this,</b> <b>something</b> should be said to clear up the question.|$|E

500|$|The relegation of fighter {{units to}} what {{appeared}} to be strategically unimportant ground attack missions led to a crisis in morale that precipitated the so-called [...] "Morotai Mutiny" [...] in April 1945, when eight of Cobby's senior pilots, including Australia's leading ace in the war, Group Captain Clive Caldwell, tendered their resignations in protest. Although one of the [...] "mutineers", Group Captain Wilf Arthur, had earlier voiced his concerns to Cobby and his headquarters staff regarding the efficacy of 1st TAF's tasking, the AOC was taken aback by the resignations. He spoke to the officers individually and as a group, asking them, [...] "Is <b>this</b> <b>something</b> against me, or having a go against me in this, because if so, if you feel that I have fallen down in my job, I will straight away ask to be recalled," [...] to which they replied, [...] "It {{has nothing to do with}} you." [...] Cobby reported the incident to his immediate superior, Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock, who informed the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Jones, and the Allied Air Forces Commander, Lieutenant General George Kenney. All made their way to Morotai and interviewed the pilots involved, and all concluded that Cobby should be relieved of his command.|$|E

2500|$|Lacan's {{concept of}} the Real dates back to 1936 and his {{doctoral}} thesis on psychosis. It was a term that was popular at the time, particularly with Émile Meyerson, who {{referred to it as}} [...] "an ontological absolute, a true being-in-itself". Lacan returned to the theme of the Real in 1953 and continued to develop it until his death. The Real, for Lacan, is not synonymous with reality. Not only opposed to the Imaginary, the Real is also exterior to the Symbolic. Unlike the latter, which is constituted in terms of oppositions (i.e. presence/absence), [...] "there is no absence in the Real." [...] Whereas the Symbolic opposition [...] "presence/absence" [...] implies the possibility that something may be missing from the Symbolic, [...] "the Real is always in its place." [...] If the Symbolic is a set of differentiated elements (signifiers), the Real in itself is undifferentiated—it bears no fissure. The Symbolic introduces [...] "a cut in the real" [...] in the process of signification: [...] "it is the world of words that creates the world of things—things originally confused in the [...] "here and now" [...] of the all in the process of coming into being." [...] The Real is that which is outside language and that resists symbolization absolutely. In Seminar XI Lacan defines the Real as [...] "the impossible" [...] because it is impossible to imagine, impossible to integrate into the Symbolic, and impossible to attain. It is this resistance to symbolization that lends the Real its traumatic quality. Finally, the Real is the object of anxiety, insofar as it lacks any possible mediation and is [...] "the essential object which is not an object any longer, but <b>this</b> <b>something</b> faced with which all words cease and all categories fail, the object of anxiety par excellence." ...|$|E
