While {{it may be}} {{too much}} <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> renaissance in traditional Norwegian architecture, more and more urban planning is affected by the need to preserve or restore these traditions. Examples include plans to renew the center of Oppdal and recent work at the Oslo neighborhood of Grünerløkka.|$|E
25|$|Chinese {{scholars}} travelling {{through the}} region between the 5th and 8th centuries, such as Faxian, Xuanzang, Yijing, Hui-sheng, and Sung-Yun, began <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{decline of the}} Buddhist Sangha in the north-west parts of Indian subcontinent, especially {{in the wake of}} the Hun invasion from central Asia. Xuanzang wrote that numerous monasteries in north-western India had been reduced to ruins by the Huns.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenotypic}} {{effect of}} a particular gene is contingent on its environment, including the fellow genes constituting with it the total genome. A gene never has a fixed effect, so {{how is it possible}} <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gene for long legs? It is because of the phenotypic differences between alleles. One may say that one allele, all other things being equal or varying within certain limits, causes greater legs than its alternative. This difference enables the scrutiny of natural selection.|$|E
25|$|He quotes St. Ambrose: the Communion bread “is not a {{prize for}} the perfect but a {{powerful}} medicine and nourishment for the weak” (EG 47). Such talk led a few cardinals in the church <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> impending schism.|$|R
2500|$|Moltmann favours [...] "fortuitous" [...] {{incarnation}} {{primarily because}} {{he feels that}} <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> incarnation <b>of</b> [...] "necessity" [...] is to do an injustice {{to the life of}} Christ. [...] Moltmann's work, alongside other systematic theologians, opens up avenues of liberation Christology.|$|R

500|$|... "Falling Down" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American pop rock band Selena Gomez & the Scene for their debut studio album, Kiss & Tell (2009). It was released on August 25, 2009 through Hollywood Records as the lead single from the album. The song was written by Ted Bruner and Trey Vittetoe, both of whom produced the track; Gina Schock of The Go-Go's also receives writing credit. Musically, [...] "Falling Down" [...] is an uptempo rock track that contains heavy usage of synths. Its lyrics see Gomez ridiculing life in Hollywood and fame, though can also be interpreted <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> romantic relationship. The song was released in select territories, receiving no official release in European territories.|$|E
500|$|Such a [...] "meaning-vector" [...] {{provides}} {{a description of}} the reference and use of an expression within a particular linguistic community. It provides the conditions for its correct usage and makes it possible to judge whether a single speaker attributes the appropriate meaning to that expression or whether its use has changed enough to cause a difference in its meaning. According to Putnam, it is legitimate <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> change in the meaning of an expression only if the reference of the term, and not its stereotype, has changed. However, since there is no possible algorithm that can determine which aspect—the stereotype or the reference—has changed in a particular case, it is necessary to consider the usage of other expressions of the language. Since there is no limit to the number of such expressions which must be considered, Putnam embraced a form of semantic holism.|$|E
2500|$|... {{so much so}} that it is {{difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> separate [...] "Deaf" [...] community.|$|E
500|$|The {{fact that}} {{addition}} is commutative {{is known as}} the [...] "commutative law of addition". This phrase suggests that there are other commutative laws: for example, there is <b>a</b> commutative law <b>of</b> multiplication. However, many binary operations are not commutative, such as subtraction and division, so it is misleading <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unqualified [...] "commutative law".|$|R
50|$|The {{documentary}} also briefly covered {{another of}} Tucker’s cases: that of Gus Taylor from the Midwest U.S., who claimed {{from around the}} age <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{year and a half}} to be his own grandfather returned to the family. In addition <b>to</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> previous life, Tucker notes that both boys <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> falling through <b>a</b> 'hole' or ‘porthole’ from one life to the next.|$|R
25|$|These two {{approaches}} could be reconciled by acknowledging {{the tension between}} an agent's interests as an individual and as <b>a</b> member <b>of</b> various groups, and seeking to somehow optimize among all of these interests. For example, it may be meaningful <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> action as being good for someone as an individual, but bad for them as <b>a</b> citizen <b>of</b> their town.|$|R
2500|$|The {{findings}} are of considerable importance, as no {{remains of the}} Greco-Bactrian and Indo-Greek civilizations had been uncovered in the East (beyond the abundant coinage) until this discovery, which led some <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Bactrian mirage." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{sign that}} the Dean {{campaign}} was starting to think beyond the primaries, they began in late 2003 <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> [...] "$100 revolution" [...] in which 2 million Americans would give $100 in order to compete with Bush.|$|E
2500|$|Whereas {{the notion}} of [...] "free {{equivalence}} relation" [...] does not exist, that of a free groupoid on a directed graph does. Thus it is meaningful <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> [...] "presentation of an equivalence relation," [...] i.e., a presentation of the corresponding groupoid; ...|$|E
5000|$|The Trio {{played a}} {{principal}} role in forming Jabal Amel's {{political and cultural}} history, being the first Shi'i intellectuals <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Arab nation and <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Arab state, and to formulate the arguments of the [...] "Arabism" [...] of the Shi'is. Rida and his companions spent two months in Aley's military prison, because of the group's violent stands against the Ottoman rule.|$|R
500|$|... "Word of God Speak" [...] {{is a song}} by Christian {{rock band}} MercyMe. Written by Bart Millard and Pete Kipley, [...] "Word of God Speak" [...] uses sparse instrumentation, {{featuring}} only piano and strings to accompany Millard's vocals. The lyrics to [...] "Word of God Speak" [...] reflect {{on the idea that}} it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> infinite God with a limited vocabulary.|$|R
3000|$|Formally, NP-completeness {{is defined}} for {{decision}} problems [27]. Optimization {{problems can be}} converted into decision problems by asking whether they admit a solution that {{is at least as}} good as some value. By abuse of language, it therefore makes sense <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> [...] "NP-complete optimization problem" [...] instead of using the phrase [...] "the decision problem corresponding to our optimization problem is NP-complete".|$|R
2500|$|Before the East–West Schism all {{bishops of}} Rome taught that the Ecumenical Councils were above any {{individual}} bishop, {{so there is}} [...] "no basis on which <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> papacy or even {{of the rise of}} the papacy in these days or those that follow".|$|E
2500|$|With {{the lists}} of bishops to which Irenaeus referred, the {{doctrine}} of the apostolic succession, firmly established in the Church at this time, of the bishops could be linked. This succession was important to establish a chain of custody for orthodoxy. [...] He felt it important, however, also <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> succession of elders (presbyters).|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, the {{geometric}} [...] "Abini-Teti style", rules out a possible {{placement of the}} statues within the orientalizing culture and period, only appearing in bronze artifacts of the 7th century BC. It is thus correct <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Proto-Sardinian, oriental artistic trend. According to Giovanni Lilliu the statues belong to an indigenous artistic and political climax, with an almost urban character.|$|E

2500|$|Indeed, Marx's {{break with}} German Idealism {{involves}} a new definition of philosophy; Louis Althusser, founder of [...] "Structural Marxism" [...] in the 1960s, would define it as [...] "class struggle in theory". Marx's {{movement away from}} university philosophy and towards the workers' movement is thus inextricably linked to his rupture with his earlier writings, which pushed Marxist commentators <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> [...] "young Marx" [...] and a [...] "mature Marx", although {{the nature of this}} cut poses problems.|$|E
2500|$|... "There is a {{field of}} action open to her (England) in South Africa which only a slight {{political}} barrier interposes to shut her out from. We refer, of course, {{to the area of}} Portuguese rule. This, it is true, at present is an undefinable area. Portugal has been a colonising power only in name. To speak of Portuguese colonies in East Africa is <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mere fiction—a fiction colourably sustained by a few scattered seaboard settlements, beyond whose narrow littoral and local limits colonisation and government have no existence." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Kingdom of Africa was an ephemeral {{frontier}} {{zone of the}} Siculo-Norman state in the former Roman province of Africa (Ifrīqiya in Tunisian Arabic), corresponding to parts of Algeria, Tunisia and Libya today. [...] The main primary sources for the kingdom are Arabic (Muslim); the Latin (Christian) sources are scanter. According to Hubert Houben, since [...] "Africa" [...] was never mentioned in the royal title of the kings of Sicily, [...] "one ought not <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ‘Norman kingdom of Africa’." [...] Rather, [...] " [...] really amounted to a constellation of Norman-held towns along coastal Ifrīqiya." ...|$|E
5000|$|The special {{relativity}} usage differs {{significantly from the}} ordinary English meaning of [...] "observer". Reference frames are inherently nonlocal constructs, covering all {{of space and time}} or <b>a</b> nontrivial part <b>of</b> it; thus it does not make sense <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> observer (in the special relativistic sense) having a location. Also, an inertial observer cannot accelerate at a later time, nor can an accelerating observer stop accelerating.|$|R
500|$|The {{music to}} [...] "Word of God Speak" [...] is {{stripped}} down, featuring piano and vocals; a string track is also present. The simple production {{was intended to}} mirror the lyrics of the song, which reflect on the concept {{that it is impossible}} <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> infinite God with the limited vocabulary <b>of</b> humanity. <b>A</b> critic, Russ Breimier, also noted the song reminds that [...] "prayer and worship are not flowery orations".|$|R
40|$|It is now quite proper <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> "active site" or "center" in (or on) <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> hydrolytic enzymes, {{chymotrypsin}} in particular. Such {{sites have}} been clearly demonstrated {{and in some}} cases they have even been investigated in detail. We are almost persuaded that they are the actual loci of enzyme activity in nature.

2500|$|... 1937-39 saw the Scottish churches {{collaborate}} {{in their}} own version of the [...] "Recall to Religion" [...] first promoted by archbishop of Canterbury Cosmo Gordon Lang who commended the way the [...] "Recall" [...] was taken up in Scotland. George MacLeod was one of twelve Ministerial Evangelists acknowledged by the General Assembly of 1938 to support the Recall. By 1939 it was possible <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> socially-aware [...] "new evangelism" [...] being practiced: [...] "The development has been away from the large meeting and toward more intensive work among people in their homes and places of work," [...] and on a more cooperative basis between denominations.|$|E
2500|$|Due to incompletely {{understood}} sociocultural factors, {{a number}} of sound changes occurred that uniformly affected all later dialects even well after the Slavic-speaking area had become dialectally differentiated, {{for at least four}} or five centuries after the initial Slavic dispersion. This makes it difficult to identify a single point at which Proto-Slavic broke up into regional dialects. [...] As a result, it is customary <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Common Slavic" [...] period during which sound changes spread across the entire Slavic-speaking area, but not necessarily with uniform results. [...] The Early Common Slavic period, from roughly 400 to 600, can be identified as Proto-Slavic proper. [...] The onomastic evidence and glosses of Slavic words in foreign-language texts show no detectable regional differences during this period.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first serious}} {{attempts}} {{to formulate a}} geologic time scale that could be applied anywhere on Earth {{were made in the}} late 18th century. The most influential of those early attempts (championed by Werner, among others) divided the rocks of Earth's crust into four types: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Quaternary. Each type of rock, according to the theory, formed during a specific period in Earth history. It was thus possible <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Tertiary Period" [...] as well as of [...] "Tertiary Rocks." [...] Indeed, [...] "Tertiary" [...] (now Paleogene and Neogene) remained in use as the name of a geological period well into the 20th century and [...] "Quaternary" [...] remains in formal use as the name of the current period.|$|E
5000|$|.....it is {{incorrect}} <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> assumption as either true or false, {{since there is}} no way of proving it to be either (If there were, it would no longer be an assumption). It is better to consider assumptions as either useful or useless, depending on whether deductions made from them corresponded to reality...Since we must start somewhere, we must have assumptions, but at least let us have as few assumptions as possible.|$|R

"From {{appreciation}} of these difficulties and metaphysical mysteries, science, and empiricist philosophy steeped in science, came <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> event {{as the cause}} of another only {{in the sense that it}} is a real condition, on the occurrence of which something else happens which would not happen without it.
