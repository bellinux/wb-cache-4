5|$|Monterey Bay Aquarium {{plays an}} active role in federal and state politics, from {{sponsoring}} governmental legislation about the ocean to persuading voter action from its visitors and online followers. <b>The</b> <b>aquarium</b> was a leading sponsor for the statewide shark fin ban in 2011. After the ban’s success <b>the</b> <b>aquarium</b> shifted its efforts to focus on ocean plastic pollution. It produced advertisements, webpages, and podcasts in 2016 in support of California Proposition 67 for a statewide ban on single-use plastic grocery bags. <b>The</b> <b>aquarium</b> hosted a plastic pollution symposium through <b>the</b> <b>Aquarium</b> Conservation Partnership in December 2016, and, in July 2017, <b>the</b> <b>aquarium</b> {{and other members of the}} partnership began eliminating their own plastic products.|$|E
5|$|Monterey Bay Aquarium {{employed}} {{over 500}} people and had 1,200 active volunteers in 2015.

5|$|In 2014, <b>the</b> <b>aquarium</b> {{stated that}} it takes no {{official}} position on the controversy of captive killer whales or other cetaceans. <b>The</b> <b>aquarium</b> was not constructed to house cetaceans, instead utilizing the 27 species of marine mammals that live in or travel through Monterey Bay {{as one of its}} exhibits by offering the opportunity to see wild marine mammals from decks that overlook the bay.|$|E

50|$|Fish {{come in a}} large {{variety of}} species, from several {{different}} geographical regions. Most aquarium fish originated in Central America, South America, Africa, or Asia. Fish can be kept in different combinations of species and in different kinds of aquatic environments.

5|$|Monterey Bay Aquarium {{developed}} {{a program in}} 1999 to allow consumers eating seafood to choose species based on the sustainability rating of each fishery. This program has continued to evolve and has led <b>the</b> <b>aquarium</b> to become influential in fisheries management and the public discussion related to sustainable seafood. In partnership with Stanford University <b>the</b> <b>aquarium</b> also runs the Center for Ocean Solutions, which participates in ocean science, policy, and law for the public, private, and community sectors.|$|E
5|$|Monterey Bay Aquarium {{helped create}} {{momentum}} {{for the establishment}} of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary in 1992, one of the largest marine protected areas in the United States.

5|$|Oscars {{will often}} {{lay claim to}} an area of <b>the</b> <b>aquarium</b> and will be very {{aggressive}} towards other fish encroaching on their newly established territory inside <b>the</b> <b>aquarium</b> or lake. The size of the territory varies {{depending on the size}} and aggressiveness of the fish based on its surroundings. Once the oscar establishes a territory, it will vigorously defend it by chasing away other fish.|$|E

5|$|Aquarists also {{propagate}} animals {{behind the}} scenes for the aquarium’s exhibits. Since 1985, <b>the</b> <b>aquarium</b> has been deeply involved in jellyfish propagation, creating three temporary exhibitions and one permanent aquarium gallery within the Open Sea wing. In August 2016, aquarists cultured comb jellies {{for the first time}} in a laboratory, which may allow them to become a model organism. For the aquarium's temporary exhibition that opened in 2014, <b>the</b> <b>aquarium</b> cultured many cephalopods because of their short life cycles. A display in the exhibition showcased how aquarists rear different species of cephalopods, including the bigfin reef squid. In partnership with Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, at least two deep-sea cephalopod species have been displayed in the exhibition, including flapjack octopuses and the vampire squid.|$|E
5|$|A {{long-lived}} fish, adult Murray cod are carnivorous and mainly eat other fish. The species {{exhibits a}} high degree of parental care for their eggs, which are spawned in the spring and are generally laid in hollow logs or on other hard surfaces. Murray cod are a popular angling target and aquaculture species. Often available through <b>the</b> <b>aquarium</b> trade, they are also a popular aquarium species in Australia.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> National <b>Aquarium</b> in Baltimore is a {{separate}} aquarium in Baltimore, Maryland. Founded in 1981, it was originally distinct from <b>the</b> Washington <b>aquarium.</b> Both used <b>the</b> title [...] "National Aquarium"; <b>the</b> National <b>Aquarium</b> in Washington, D.C., was older, while <b>the</b> National <b>Aquarium</b> in Baltimore is larger. Like its Washington counterpart, <b>the</b> National <b>Aquarium</b> in Baltimore is not managed or funded by the federal government, despite the official-sounding names.

5|$|Co-founder, Billy Childish {{left the}} group in 2001, but has stated that he remains {{committed}} to its principles.

5|$|Some isopod {{groups have}} evolved a {{parasitic}} lifestyle, particularly as external parasites of fish. They can damage or kill their hosts {{and can cause}} significant economic loss to commercial fisheries. In reef aquariums, parasitic isopods can become a pest, endangering the fish and possibly injuring <b>the</b> <b>aquarium</b> keeper. Some {{members of the family}} Cirolanidae suck the blood of fish, and others, in the family Aegidae, consume the blood, fins, tail and flesh and can kill the fish in the process.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the bluespotted ribbontail ray as Near Threatened. Although still relatively common and widely distributed, this species faces continuing degradation of its coral reef habitat throughout its range, from development and destructive fishing practices using cyanide or dynamite. In addition, its populations are under heavy pressure by artisanal and commercial fisheries, and by local collecting for <b>the</b> <b>aquarium</b> trade.|$|E

5|$|Corals are {{collected}} for <b>the</b> <b>aquarium</b> trade, {{and this may}} be done with little care for the long-term survival of the reef. Fishing among reefs is difficult and trawling does much mechanical damage. In {{some parts of the world}} explosives are used to dislodge fish from reefs, and cyanide may be used for the same purpose; both practices not only kill reef inhabitants indiscriminately but also kill or damage the corals, sometimes stressing them so much that they expel their zooxanthellae and become bleached.|$|E
5|$|David Packard {{commissioned}} a feasibility {{study for the}} potential aquarium as his daughter {{was one of the}} four collaborating biologists. The proposed aquarium was predicted to attract 350,000 paying visitors annually, so Packard donated US$7 million for the construction of the building. After seven years of construction and US$47 million more from Packard, totaling US$54 million, Monterey Bay Aquarium opened on October 20, 1984 as the largest public aquarium in the United States. About 2.4 million people visited <b>the</b> <b>aquarium</b> within the following year.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, {{the leopard}} shark is caught by {{commercial}} and recreational fisheries {{for food and}} <b>the</b> <b>aquarium</b> trade. This species is mostly fished in the waters off California where, {{after a period of}} population decline in the 1980s, new fishing regulations in the early 1990s reduced harvesting to sustainable levels. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as of Least Concern, while noting that local stocks may easily become overfished because of the shark's slow growth and limited migratory habits.|$|E
