The house pad is a small levelled area covered by grasses but identifiable by an extant <b>timber</b> <b>support</b> and scatter of metal artefacts. Artefacts included a door bolt and hinge, metal barrel hoop, horse mouth-bit and U-frame and hook - possibly used to hang cooking pots over an open fire.|$|E
50|$|The Laurel Run {{mine fire}} began on December 6, 1915, in the Red Ash Coal Mine. A miner accidentally left a carbide lamp {{hanging from a}} <b>timber</b> <b>support,</b> which caught fire.

50|$|The school {{building}} is a simple structure of timber with a corrugated iron hipped roof truncated where a skillion-roofed verandah has been added on its western side. The building sits on low timber stumps and a small set of stairs {{on the eastern side}} gains entrance to the classroom. The walls are timber tongue-and-groove vertical joints and the schoolroom has sliding 6 pane windows on three walls. The room has a coved timber ceiling with a central lattice vent and a large <b>timber</b> <b>support</b> beam across the width of the room. The room contains some of its original desks and chairs dating from 1946 as well as other original pieces such as framed embroidery by former students.|$|E

It is 4m wide and 2.7m deep. The pagoda-style roof is clad in terracotta shingles and has terracotta ridge capping. The <b>timber</b> <b>support</b> posts have been set diagonally to allow for four decorative brackets on each corner. The two southern posts appear to be replacements as they are set on metal saddle brackets, whereas the northern posts are set within the curved concrete supports. These supports sit on a concrete slab which then sits on an exposed stonewall footing. Small gardens border the north and south of the footings.|$|E

50|$|While {{serving as}} a YHA hostel, the Manor, which was {{upgraded}} to Grade II* listed in 2003, became a favourite of ghost hunters from across the UK. The hostel was eventually closed and the Manor was sold off by the council when the upkeep costs became too much, following {{the collapse of a}} <b>timber</b> <b>support</b> in 2006. The purchaser's plan to convert the manor into a hotel and function rooms, trading on the historic and paranormal links (including a visit from the Most Haunted Live television programme in May 2006), was never realised and ownership reverted to the council. The Manor was put up for sale by auction in London on 21 September 2010, but failed to meet its reserve price. The Manor was first listed on the Heritage at Risk Register by English Heritage in 2011.|$|E

5000|$|A recent large model, {{weighing}} approximately 500 kg and 23 m long, {{was built}} in September 2009 by TV presenter James May {{and a team of}} volunteers from the engineering department of the University of Liverpool, who created a Meccano bridge spanning the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in Liverpool. As with other models of this size and weight some non-Meccano parts were used. It was built from [...] "about 100,000 pieces of real Meccano", taking 1,100 hours, and consisted of a 9-metre (29.5 ft) [...] "swing bridge" [...] section, and a 12-metre (39.4 ft) [...] "drawbridge" [...] section. A contender for the largest model on record {{was built in}} 2014 by Graham Shepherd of Grahamstown, South Africa. The fully motorized Krupp 288 Bucket Wheel Excavator (as used on large opencast mining) is complete with auxiliary conveyors. Construction utilised Meccano parts as well as replica and strengthened parts (thickened profile plates and high tensile bolts in areas carrying large loads). Shepherd reports the model as being 1,335 kilograms (2,943 pounds) in mass and 17 ft tall. It required substantial <b>timber</b> <b>support</b> frames to facilitate final assembly.|$|E
5000|$|The {{church was}} founded on 9 September 1840.

This Foundation Stone of a church dedicated to the honor and worship of Almighty God! and to be denominated 'The Church of St. John the Baptist' was laid the 9th day of September, 1840.

40|$|Geodesic curves in {{surfaces}} {{are not only}} minimizers of distance, {{but they are also}} the curves of zero geodesic (sideways) curvature. It turns out that this property makes patterns of geodesics the basic geometric entity when dealing with the cladding of a freeform surface with wooden panels which do not bend sideways. Likewise a geodesic is the favored shape of <b>timber</b> <b>support</b> elements in freeform architecture, for reasons of manufacturing and statics. Both problem areas are fundamental in freeform architecture, but so far only experimental solutions have been available. This paper provides a systematic treatment and shows how to design geodesic patterns in different ways: The evolution of geodesic curves is good for local studies and simple patterns; the level set formulation can deal with the global layout of multiple patterns of geodesics; finally geodesic vector fields allow us to interactively model geodesic patterns and perform surface segmentation into panelizable parts. © 2010 ACM...|$|E
40|$|BedRock Mining Support (Pty) Ltd is a fully {{integrated}} timber-based mine support company that supplies <b>timber</b> <b>support</b> {{to the gold}} and platinum mines. BedRock runs a J. I. T process and therefore has a challenge to consistently produce and provide quality products to the platinum mines. This {{is due to the}} fact that timber has a limited shelf life and timber extraction from plantations is rendered during the wet months. Currently a buffer has been implemented, but can only serve mines within its region, therefore mines that fall outside this region will struggle obtain timber during the wet months. A proposed centralised site located back in the chain is seen to be a solution to the current concerns and the bigger picture. A facilities plan needs to be generated for management purposes of understanding the size of the depot that is required and layout to use as a benchmark when a physical site is determined. Research was done to determine the best methodology to apply to the project problem. Systematic planning procedures became the viable option and were then used to develop a design. The design involved defining the project environment, using quantitative and qualitative measurements to determine the degree of closeness for each department relative to each other. These measurements were then used to produce various charts and diagrams that assisted in the development of alternative facility layouts known as block layouts. These block layouts were then evaluated by means of three integrated techniques to finally reveal the most feasible layout design that BedRock would use in their New Centralised Depot. The size of the depot was calculated to be 20262 square meters and block layout 2 was deemed the most feasible layout design. Thesis (B Eng.
