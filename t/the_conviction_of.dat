5|$|Bill C-213 or Louis Riel Day Act and Bill C-417 Louis Riel Act are {{the more}} notable acts which have gone through parliament. Bill C-297 to revoke <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>of</b> Louis Riel was {{introduced}} to the House of Commons 21 October and 22 November 1996, however the motion lacked unanimous consent from the House and was dropped. Bill C-213 or the Louis Riel Day Act of 1997 attempted to revoke <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>of</b> Louis Riel for high treason and establish a National Day in his honour on 16 November. Bill C-417 or the Louis Riel Act which also had a first reading in parliament to revoke <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>of</b> Louis Riel, and establish 15 July as Louis Riel Day was tabled.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. It was first {{available}} from Oxford University Press via [URL] intergenerational transmission of criminal behaviour is well-recognized, but less is known about the mechanisms that may explain it. This study presents new analyses from the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development, which examine the intergenerational transmission <b>of</b> criminal <b>convictions.</b> It then investigates mediation via psychosocial risk factors. <b>The</b> <b>convictions</b> <b>of</b> fathers and mothers were significantly related to <b>the</b> <b>convictions</b> <b>of</b> their male offspring, and this was mediated via the fathers’ drug use. However, <b>the</b> <b>convictions</b> <b>of</b> fathers were only indirectly related to <b>the</b> <b>convictions</b> <b>of</b> female offspring via the father’s cohabitation problems. <b>The</b> <b>convictions</b> <b>of</b> mothers were also indirectly related to those of the female offspring through harsh parental discipline. Accurate identification of the role that psychosocial risk factors play in intergenerational pathways for males and females can inform much more effective gender-specific prevention.

5|$|When Harlan was a Circuit Judge in 1955, he {{authorized}} the decision upholding <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>of</b> {{leaders of the}} Communist Party USA (including Elizabeth Gurley Flynn) under the Smith Act. The ruling {{was based on the}} previous Supreme Court's decisions, by which the Court of Appeals was bound. Later, when he was a Supreme Court justice, Harlan, however, wrote an opinion overturning <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>of</b> Communist Party activists as unconstitutional in the case of Yates v. United States. Another such case was Watkins v. United States.|$|E
5|$|In their decision, the Supreme Court {{held that}} the {{application}} of curfews against citizens is constitutional. As a companion case to Hirabayashi v. United States, both decided on June 21, 1943, the court affirmed <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>of</b> U.S.-born Minoru Yasui. The court remanded {{the case to the}} district court for sentencing as the lower court had determined the curfew was not valid against citizens, but Yasui had forfeited his citizenship by working for the Japanese consulate. The Yasui and Hirabayashi decisions, along with the later Ex parte Endo and Korematsu v. United States decisions, determined the legality of the curfews and relocations during the war. In the 1980s, new information was used to vacate <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>of</b> Yasui.|$|E

5|$|New Jersey {{is one of}} {{only two}} states (along with Wisconsin) that {{classify}} DUI as a traffic violation, and not a criminal offense, except in cases of serious injury or death. Because it is not a criminal offense, those charged in New Jersey with DUI and related offenses are not fingerprinted, do {{not have the right to}} a jury trial, DUI arrests and convictions are not submitted to the FBI's NCIC criminal database, and DUI arrests and convictions cannot be expunged. Statutory criminal defenses (e.g. duress, entrapment) are not available for DUI, and in State v. Hammond, the state Supreme Court upheld <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>of</b> a person who drove after unknowingly having his drink spiked with alcohol. Common-law criminal defenses are available in DUI cases, and a state appellate court reversed <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>of</b> a person who drove while intoxicated in order to escape assailants, citing the doctrine of necessity.|$|E

5|$|Three United States Supreme Court {{decisions}} in 1919 each upheld convictions under laws against {{certain kinds of}} anti-war speech. In 1919, the Court upheld <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>of</b> Socialist Party leader Charles Schenck for publishing anti-war literature. In Debs v. United States, the court upheld <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>of</b> Eugene Debs. While the Court upheld a conviction a third time in Abrams v. United States, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote an important dissent which has gradually been absorbed as an American principle: he urged the court to treat freedom of speech as a fundamental right, which should rarely be restricted.|$|E
5|$|Sri Lankan Tamil {{nationalism}} is <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>of</b> the Sri Lankan Tamil people, a minority ethnic {{group in the}} South Asian island country of Sri Lanka (formerly known as Ceylon), {{that they have the}} right to constitute an independent or autonomous political community. This idea has not always existed. Sri Lankan Tamil national awareness began during the era of British rule during the nineteenth century, as Tamil Hindu revivalists tried to counter Protestant missionary activity. The revivalists, led by Arumuga Navalar, used literacy as a tool to spread Hinduism and its principles.|$|E

5|$|The {{relative}} ease of making reproductions has also encouraged many forgeries: {{a survey of}} expert opinion placed Rodin in the top ten most-faked artists.

A massive forgery was discovered by French authorities in the early 1990s and led to <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>of</b> art dealer Guy Hain.|$|E

5|$|In September 2014, it was {{reported}} that Gröning had been charged by state prosecutors with having been an accessory to murder for his role at Auschwitz receiving and processing prisoners and their personal belongings. The indictment stated that Gröning economically advanced Nazi Germany and aided the systematic killing of 300,000 of the 425,000 Hungarian Jews who were deported to Auschwitz by 137 railway transports during the summer of 1944. Gröning's prosecution has been reported {{to be a part of}} Germany’s final effort to bring the last Nazi war-crimes suspects to justice. State prosecutors managed to charge the defendant on a legal precedent set in 2011 by <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>of</b> the former Sobibor extermination camp guard John Demjanjuk by a court in Munich.|$|E

5|$|By mid-May it {{was clear}} that he would not make the Derby and he was removed from the race on the 23 May. Orme's trainer John Porter and Williams, the {{veterinary}} surgeon, remained convinced that he had been poisoned and was not just suffering from bad teeth. A reward of £1,000 was even offered for information that would lead to <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>of</b> the guilty party. The poisoning was investigated by George Lewis, a solicitor, who concluded that the horse had been poisoned. He stated that the horse was fine on the morning of the 21 April, but a few hours later his tongue was so inflamed he could not hold it in his mouth; something so sudden, Lewis argued, could not have been caused by a decaying tooth. He suggested that the poison may have in fact been attempted to be administered by some ball being put down his throat, but due to the struggles of the horse, it burst in his mouth, blistering his tongue. The Derby was won by Sir Hugo, but many believed that Orme would have won easily had he made the race.|$|E
