40|$|Abstract: <b>The</b> {{mechanical}} <b>rubbing</b> of a polyimide (PI) layer with {{a velvet}} cloth has been dominantly used to induce a uniform alignment of liquid crystal molecules {{in the manufacturing}} process of liquid crystal displays (LCDs). The rub-bing process is affected by its process parameters and also by the nature and properties of <b>the</b> <b>rubbing</b> cloth used. We fabricated <b>the</b> <b>rubbing</b> cloths with various pile densities and different weaving structures and then investigated how the parameters {{were related to the}} effect of the cloth on <b>the</b> <b>rubbing</b> process and <b>the</b> properties of <b>rubbed</b> PI alignment lay-ers (ALs). As the pile density increases at same <b>rubbing</b> process parameters, <b>the</b> degree of molecular orientation of <b>the</b> <b>rubbed</b> AL and its surface roughness increase with an increase of the contact area between <b>the</b> <b>rubbing</b> cloth and <b>the</b> AL surface. Furthermore, a more uniform rubbing is also achieved.

25|$|The eastern {{slope of}} the {{mountain}} range in Asir is gentle, melding into a plateau region that drops gradually into <b>the</b> <b>Rub</b> al Khali. Although rainfall is infrequent in this area, a number of fertile wadis, of which the most important are the Wadi Bishah and the Wadi Tathlith, make oasis agriculture possible on a relatively large scale. A number of extensive lava fields (harrat) scar the surfaces of the plateaus east of the mountain ranges in the Hijaz and give evidence of fairly recent volcanic activity. The largest of these beds is Khaybar, north of Medina; another is Al Harrah, part of the large volcanic field Harrat Ash Shamah. Famous cities of Hejaz include the holy city of Medina {{and the city of}} Taif.|$|E
25|$|Farther east {{the terrain}} changes {{abruptly}} {{to the flat}} lowlands of the coastal plain. This area, about sixty kilometers wide, is generally featureless and covered with gravel or sand. In the north is the Ad Dibdibah graveled plain and in the south the 'Al Jafurah sand desert, which reaches the gulf near Dhahran and merges with <b>the</b> <b>Rub</b> al Khali at its southern end. The coast itself is extremely irregular, merging sandy plains, marshes, and salt flats almost imperceptibly with the sea. As a result, the land surface is unstable; in places water rises almost to the surface, and the sea is shallow, with shoals and reefs extending far offshore. Only the construction of long moles at Ras Tanura has opened the Saudi coast on the gulf to seagoing tankers.|$|E

50|$|Once the {{preliminary}} leatherskin 'Puri' is fastened onto {{the face of}} the tabla, the craftsman applies the glue in a circle on the surface leaving a half-inch margin from the 'Chati'. When the glue is about to set, the syahi is applied in a 2-3 mm thick layer over the glue with small spikes in the syahi layer. Once the syahi is semi-hardened and not yet dry, <b>the</b> <b>rubbing</b> with <b>the</b> stone begins. <b>The</b> <b>rubbing</b> continues till it removes the spikes and a coarse surface results. On this, layers are then added in reducing concentric circles, each half to one mm thick.

500|$|In the {{beginning}} of April the royalists held a conference with Faisal in Riyadh.

On February 18 a task force of fifteen tanks, twenty armored cars, eighteen trucks and numerous jeeps took off from San'a' moving northwards, heading for Sadah. More garrison troops followed. A few days later another task force, spearheaded by 350 men in tanks and armored cars, struck out from Sadah southeastwards toward Marib. The maneuvered into <b>the</b> <b>Rub</b> al-Khali desert, perhaps well into Saudi territory, and there they were built up by an airlift. Then they headed westwards. On February 25 they occupied Marib and on March 7 they took Harib. A royalist force of 1,500 men ordered down from Najran failed to stop them {{on their way out}} from Sadah. The royalist commander at Harib fled to Beihan, on the British-protected side of the border.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Rubbing</b> between <b>the</b> rotor and the stator is the {{frequent}} fault and will cause very serious accident, even catastrophe, to rotating machinery. Therefore, timely detection of such rubbing {{is very important}} avoid severe consequences. Vibration based methods are very mature and traditional methods but not effective to detect incipient rubbing in rotating machinery. <b>Rubbing</b> between <b>the</b> rotor and the stator will cause elastic strain in <b>the</b> <b>rubbing</b> location and thus can produce acoustic emission (AE).

30|$|This {{phenomenon}} can {{be explained}} by the anisotropic adsorption of the dye molecules. Random lasers in organic dye solutions can be highly linearly polarized by choosing a highly viscous solvent for the anisotropic adsorption of the dye molecules [36]. There is guest-host effect in dye-doped nematic liquid crystals. According to this effect, rod-shaped dye molecules as “guest” molecules aligned along the direction of the rod-shaped “host” liquid crystal molecules [37, 38]. Dye molecules will tend to absorb light with the polarization direction along the long axis of the dye molecules [39]. When the dye molecules release the energy again, the polarization direction of the emitted light is along the long axis of the dye molecules, which is the direction of the nematic liquid crystal [23]. Due to <b>the</b> <b>rubbing</b> methods controlling <b>the</b> alignment of liquid crystals, the polarization of the emitted light is influenced by <b>the</b> <b>rubbing</b> direction. In <b>the</b> experiment, the anchor force formed from <b>the</b> <b>rubbing</b> behavior is largest for the liquid crystal molecules near the cell surface while is smallest for that in the central of the cell. The inner liquid crystal molecules, which keep away from the cell surface, are not along the nematic director decided by <b>the</b> <b>rubbing</b> direction due to the weak anchor force. However, anchor force will make the alignment of liquid crystal molecules along the orientation direction near the alignment layer, and the light paths can form different loops, as previously mentioned. When the pump light propagates through the cells and produces the random laser, the light with the polarization direction along <b>the</b> <b>rubbing</b> direction will get the largest gain. However, it is hard to get any gain by the light whose polarization direction is not along <b>the</b> <b>rubbing</b> direction. So, <b>the</b> polarization direction of the emitted random laser will gain along <b>the</b> <b>rubbing</b> direction of <b>the</b> cells due to the polarization-dependent optical gain effect. This phenomenon exist in both the forward random laser and backward random laser. This effect can be used to get different random laser beams with different polarization directions from one cell at the same time, which is useful in liquid crystal display and some other fields that polarized light is needed.|$|R
