40|$|International audienceFive-axis {{machining}} allows continuous {{adjustment of}} cutter orientation along a <b>tool</b> <b>pass.</b> Unfortunately, the flexibility {{has not been}} fully exploited due to the separate consideration of tool path generation and cutter orientation in current machining methods. This paper presents an integrated method (IM) for tool path generation, which is tightly integrated with the orientation strategy, to minimise tool path length under the constraint of smooth cutter orientation. Distinctively, cutter orientation along a <b>tool</b> <b>pass</b> is optimised by balancing considerations of maximum material removal and smoothness of cutter movement. Further, the intervals between successive <b>tool</b> <b>passes</b> are maximised according to the optimised orientation. In the paper, the IM is combined with the quadric method, a recently developed cutter orientation strategy, for iso-parametric machining with a flat-end cutter. However, the method {{could be applied to}} other orientation strategies with different machining mechanisms and cutter types. Simulated examples illustrate that the IM is more efficient in machining than established methods...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{the present}} study, {{response}} surface methodology {{has been used}} to optimize turn-assisted deep cold rolling process of AISI 4140 steel. A regression model is developed to predict surface hardness and surface roughness using response surface methodology and central composite design. In the development of predictive model, deep cold rolling force, ball diameter, initial roughness of the workpiece, and number of <b>tool</b> <b>passes</b> are considered as model variables. The rolling force and the ball diameter are the significant factors on the surface hardness and ball diameter and numbers of <b>tool</b> <b>passes</b> are found to be significant for surface roughness. The predicted surface hardness and surface roughness values and the subsequent verification experiments under the optimal operating conditions confirmed the validity of the predicted model. The absolute average error between the experimental and predicted values at the optimal combination of parameter settings for surface hardness and surface roughness is calculated as 0. 16 % and 1. 58 % respectively. Using the optimal processing parameters, the surface hardness is improved from 225 to 306 HV, which resulted in an increase in the near surface hardness by about 36 % and the surface roughness is improved from 4. 84 µm to 0. 252 µm, which resulted in decrease in the surface roughness by about 95 %. The depth of compression is found to be more than 300 µm from the microstructure analysis and this is in correlation with the results obtained from the microhardness measurements. Taylor hobson talysurf tester, micro vickers hardness tester, optical microscopy and X-ray diffractometer are used to characterize the modified surface layer.
