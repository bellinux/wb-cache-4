5|$|Rilke {{stayed with}} Rodin in 1905 and 1906, and did {{administrative}} work for him; {{he would later}} write a laudatory monograph on the sculptor. Rodin and Beuret's modest country estate in Meudon, purchased in 1897, was a host to such visitors as King Edward, dancer Isadora Duncan, and harpsichordist Wanda Landowska. Rodin moved to the city in 1908, renting <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>floor</b> of the Hôtel Biron, an 18th-century townhouse. He left Beuret in Meudon, and began an affair with the American-born Duchesse de Choiseul. From 1910, he mentored the Russian sculptor, Moissey Kogan.|$|E

5|$|The Sistine Chapel is 40.9metres {{long and}} 14metres wide. The ceiling rises to 13.4metres above <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>floor</b> of the chapel. The vault is of quite a complex design {{and it is}} {{unlikely}} that it was originally intended to have such elaborate decoration. Pier Matteo d'Amelia provided a plan for its decoration with the architectural elements picked out and the ceiling painted blue and dotted with gold stars, {{similar to that of the}} Arena Chapel decorated by Giotto at Padua.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} building's {{main floor}} has vaulted ceilings, large windows, brick walls, a flat roof, and wooden cross beams. The mezzanine {{consists of three}} rooms.

5|$|Atticus {{does not}} want Jem and Scout to be present at Tom Robinson's trial. No seat is {{available}} on <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>floor,</b> so by invitation of the Rev. Sykes, Jem, Scout, and Dill watch from the colored balcony. Atticus establishes that the accusers—Mayella and her father, Bob Ewell, the town drunk—are lying. It also becomes clear that the friendless Mayella made sexual advances toward Tom, and that her father caught her and beat her. Despite significant evidence of Tom's innocence, the jury convicts him. Jem's faith in justice becomes badly shaken, as is Atticus', when the hapless Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape from prison.|$|E
5|$|The Robert M. Strozier Library is Florida State's main library. It {{is located}} in the {{historic}} central area of the campus adjacent to Landis Green and occupies seven floors. Strozier's collections focus on the humanities, social sciences, business, and education. The facility has been renovated several times. In 2008, the lower floor reopened as the graduate- and faculty-focused Scholars Commons. In 2010, <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>floor</b> was transformed into an undergraduate-focused Learning Commons. The most recent renovation added smart study rooms, an enlarged computer area, new circulation areas, a tutoring center, and the nation's first double-sided Starbucks. Strozier also houses the Special Collections and Archives division and Heritage Protocol. Strozier Library is open 24-hours on weekdays during the fall and spring semesters. The library closes early on Friday and Saturday nights and maintains decreased hours during the summer semester.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Willamette University {{purchased}} the old building from the YWCA. The $1.35 million purchase included the main YWCA building {{adjacent to the}} former library {{for a total of}} , with the YWCA continuing their operations in the building for three years after the sale. After that group left the building in 2006, Willamette spent $4.6 million ($2 million more than originally planned) to remodel the old library building over a year's time and convert it into the Oregon Civic Justice Center as part of the College of Law. The remodeling project began in the summer of 2007 and included removing a swimming pool structure that had been added to the south of the building, while also adding a new entrance to the former library on the same side as where the pool was located. Renovations also removed a mezzanine that the YWCA had added to the upper portion of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>floor.</b> Other renovations included new heating, cooling, and ventilation systems, upgrades for technology, all while retaining the historical look and feel of the original 1912 building.|$|E

5|$|The Altes Stadthaus is {{arranged}} around two rectangular internal courtyards. The main section, which faces Mühlheimer Platz, has a mansard roof and is framed by four-storey turrets. The main entrance {{is at the}} southwest corner of Bottlerplatz, and the building bridges Windeckstraße, with two low arched openings. Bestelmayer's building was intended to be the nucleus of future development in the centre of Bonn. However, the only other construction there was the tax office on the corner of Mülheimer Platz and Münsterstraße, built in 1937, and some further building on Bottlerplatz. After the Neues Stadthaus—the new city administration building—was built, <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>floor</b> of the section of Altes Stadthaus facing Mühlheimer Platz was rebuilt to house the library. In the course of this restructuring, the two courtyards were roofed over and several interior walls replaced with columns. The east wing of the building was demolished {{to make way for a}} C department store.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the crashed plane, in which Hank discovers a dead pilot and the $4.4 million in cash, was filmed on a soundstage. A second plane, designed to have frosted windows, was attached to a gimbal, about five feet off the ground. To match the interior with footage shot in Wisconsin, the art department built a set with real trees and a painted backdrop. To depict Hank being attacked by a flock of crows inside the plane, puppets were used to attack Paxton as he appeared on screen, while two live crows were used to attack an animatronic replica of the actor. A separate soundstage was used to create two sets depicting the interiors of the Mitchell home, where Hank and his wife Sarah (Fonda) reside. The first set was <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>floor</b> an exterior entrance way, and the second was created for the upstairs bedrooms. Principal photography concluded on March 13, 1998, after 55 days of filming.|$|E
5|$|The librarians {{sought a}} larger and more centrally-located space than the Briarcliff Farms building. On March 18, 1930, after {{invitation}} from the Briarcliff school district's Board of Education, the library was relocated again. It moved to a large room on <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>floor</b> of Briarcliff High School's extension to its Law Park school building. In August 1949, the school required more classroom space, so the Board of Education asked the library to relocate. The village board then provided the library with two rooms {{on the second floor}} of its recreation building near the village downtown on Old Route 100 (then part of NY Route 100). From the beginning, the recreation center rooms were too small to hold the library's collection (only holding about 7,000 of its 8,500 books), had insufficient room for tables and chairs, and no space for exhibits or displays. As well, the area was busy with traffic, due to its location at the intersection of two highways. It was also far from the village's public school buildings and had no sidewalks nearby, making it poorly-accessible and hazardous for children to visit.|$|E
50|$|The library has a {{continuous}} Book Sale occurring on <b>the</b> library's <b>Main</b> <b>Floor.</b> <b>The</b> library accepts donations of books, tapes/CDs, old maps, old postcards, children's books, and magazines.|$|R
5000|$|Coleshill House was double-pile building, {{influenced}} by Jones's Queens House in Greenwich, and combining Italian, French, Dutch and English architectural ideas. It measured approximately 120 x 60 ft, with two <b>main</b> <b>floors</b> of nine bays, above a rusticated basement, and an attic with seven prominent dormer windows and four tall chimneystacks {{on each side}} of the hipped roof. The roof was topped by a flat deck surrounded by a balustrade with a central belvedere cupola. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>floors</b> had equal proportions for storeys, unlike the Palladian emphasis on the piano nobile.|$|R
50|$|In 2005-2006, the {{building}} was renovated from a neglected and dilapidated state {{after three years of}} vacancy by <b>the</b> current <b>main</b> <b>floor</b> tenants: a locally owned coffee house, Gracious Goods Cafe.|$|R
