50|$|When wood {{is heated}} above 270°C it begins <b>to</b> <b>carbonize.</b> If air is absent the final product, {{since there is}} no oxygen present to react with the wood, is charcoal. If air, which {{contains}} oxygen, is present, the wood will catch fire and burn when it reaches a temperature of about 400-500°C and the fuel product is wood ash. If wood is heated away from air, first the moisture is driven off and until this is complete, the wood temperature remains at about 100-110°C. When the wood is dry its temperature rises and at about 270°C it begins to spontaneously decompose and, at the same time, heat is evolved. This is the well known exothermic reaction which takes place in charcoal burning. At this stage evolution of the by-products of wood carbonization starts. These substances are given off gradually as the temperature rises and at about 450°C the evolution is complete. The solid residue, charcoal, is mainly carbon (about 70%) and small amounts of tarry substances which can be driven off or decomposed completely only by raising the temperature to above about 600°C.|$|E

30|$|The {{desulfurization}} rate of PSS {{is significantly}} improved {{in comparison with}} SO 4 2 −/ZrO 2, due to the temperature increasing which {{increase the amount of}} SO 4 2 − in the surface of solid acid [18]. Solid acidity is strong <b>to</b> <b>carbonize</b> ionic liquid partially, and block acid sites on the surface of solid acid to reduce the material activity, so its desulfurization rate is lower than PSO. For Zr element, it can be determined that binding structure of SO 4 2 − to Zr ions exhibits the bridged bidentate form [21]. As the SO 4 2 − group existed, due to the strong attracting electrons from Zr ions via two covalent S=O bonds, the center of metal atom lacks electrons severely, thus strong Lewis acidic strength is generated (Fig.  2), which could adsorb benzothiophene easily. That’s the reason why the desulfurization rate of PSO is higher than PSS.|$|E
