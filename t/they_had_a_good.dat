25|$|For anti-torpedo-boat defense, the Lord Nelsons {{retained}} {{a battery of}} 12-pounders. These were mounted on a large flying deck amidships, where <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> field of fire. However, this innovative mounting scheme also was criticised because it made a good target and because in combat falling debris due to damage might foul the 9.2-inch turrets below. In addition, some officers believed that the all-12-pounder battery was too light to deal with larger, modern torpedo boats.|$|E
25|$|Founded at Canterbury in 1084-5, St Gregory's Abbey {{began to}} claim, from 1087, {{to have the}} relics of both St Mildrith and her {{successor}} as Abbess, St Eadburg, having translated them from Lyminge Abbey. At {{the time of the}} translation, two or three years before, they had translated the relics of St Eadburg and an unknown saint. The production of a full account of the lives of Domne Eafe and Mildrith appears to have been made to further this claim. That they produced a text that is broadly very harmonious with other known texts suggests <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> source document, and it would seem likely that a Thanet-based text had come from Lyminge with the relics. Goscelin, in a document known as the contra usurpatores, strongly refuted their claim on Mildrith. In doing so he describes two separate documents produced by the Gregorians, and it would appear these are now combined into {{what is known as the}} Gotha text.|$|E
25|$|Using {{clues to}} retrace their steps, the trio travel to a {{hospital}} where they discover they were drugged with Rohypnol ("roofies"), causing their memory loss, and that {{they came to the}} hospital from a chapel. At the chapel, they learn that Stu married a stripper named Jade, despite being in a long-term relationship with his abusive, domineering girlfriend Melissa. Outside the chapel, the trio is attacked by gangsters saying they are looking for someone. They flee and visit Jade, discovering that she is the mother of the baby, whose real name is Tyler. They are then arrested by the police for stealing the police cruiser. After being told that the Mercedes has been impounded, the trio is released when they unknowingly volunteer to be targets for a taser demonstration. While driving the Mercedes, they discover a naked Chinese man named Leslie Chow in the trunk. Chow jumps out of the trunk, beats the trio up with a crowbar and flees. Alan confesses that he drugged their drinks to ensure <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> night, believing the drug to be ecstasy.|$|E

25|$|As the runner-up of {{previous}} World T20 competition, Sri Lanka went Bangladesh under the captaincy of Dinesh Chandimal to 2014 ICC World Twenty20. In the group stage at Super 10 stage, they played with South Africa, New Zealand, England, and Netherlands. In the first match, Sri Lanka played with South Africa. Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to bat first. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> understanding about Bangladeshi pitches, due to Bangladesh bilateral tournament and 2014 Asia Cup, {{which was held}} prior to the World T20 at the same site. Sri Lankan opener Kusal Perera reminded all sorts of aggressive shots by legendary Sanath Jayasuriya. Kusal's master stroke was a photocopy of Jayasuriya and he devastated Dale Steyn, Morné Morkel, and Lonwabo Tsotsobe. He scored 61 runs off 40 balls giving Sri Lanka a total of 165/7. South Africans was not down as yet, where they progressively built the innings. With the wickets in crucial intervals, they {{ended up in the}} losing side with 5 runs short. Kusal was the Man-of-the-Match.|$|E
25|$|The Essex v Northamptonshire {{match was}} played at Valentines Park, Ilford 17 to 20 May. Northamptonshire won the toss {{and decided to}} bat, scoring 215 all out with a top score of 49 by Vince Broderick while Essex's Test leg break and googly bowler Peter Smith took four for 65. By close of play on Saturday, Essex had replied to 170 for 4 with opener Chick Cray on 90 not out. He {{completed}} his century, exactly 100, on Monday morning and Essex went on to total 267 all out. Northamptonshire were 219 for 5 at the close on Monday evening with their veteran batsman John Timms on 90 not out. Timms was out for 112 on Tuesday morning and Peter Smith completed ten in the match by taking six for 84 in the Northamptonshire total of 291. Essex therefore needed 240 to win with ample time left on the final day. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> stand of 103 for the fourth wicket between Frank Vigar (60) and Len Clark (64) but spinners Broderick and Bertie Clarke kept picking up the wickets and Essex were still ten behind when the ninth went down. The last pair were captain Tom Pearce and wicketkeeper Tom Wade who managed to level the scores before Wade was bowled by Clarke to tie the match.|$|E

500|$|In January 2008, {{composer}} Yasunori Mitsuda {{remarked that}} [...] "there {{are a lot}} of politics involved" [...] in creating a new game, and stressed that Masato Kato should participate in development should a new entry in the series materialize.

TV Squad's Annie Wu wrote: [...] "With the three hosts {{appearing}} on each other's shows all on one night, it was special appearances galore. It became a clash of the Titans, a battle of epic proportions, a heaping helping of Monday fanservice." [...] Even so, the three comedians [...] "shared a certain comedic sensibility", and admitted that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time while helping each other out. O'Brien said: [...] "It certainly helped that all three of us [...] in a period of our careers where we're looking for content." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{enforcement}} of the persecutory edicts was inconsistent. Since the Tetrarchs {{were more or less}} sovereign in their own realms, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal of control over persecutory policy. In Constantius's realm (Britain and Gaul) the persecution was, at most, only lightly enforced; in Maximian's realm (Italy, Spain, and Africa), it was firmly enforced; and in the East, under Diocletian (Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine and Egypt) and Galerius (Greece and the Balkans), its provisions were pursued with more fervor than anywhere else. For the Eastern provinces, Peter Davies tabulated the total number of martyrdoms for an article in the Journal of Theological Studies. Davies argued that the figures, although reliant on collections of acta that are incomplete and only partially reliable, point to a heavier persecution under Diocletian than under Galerius. The historian Simon Corcoran, in a passage on the origins of the early persecution edicts, criticized Davies' over-reliance on these [...] "dubious martyr acts" [...] and dismissed his conclusions.|$|E

500|$|Webber {{dominated}} {{the previous two}} rounds in Spain and Monaco and clinched the pole position in both events. Despite the form, Webber said Red Bull were still wary of their rivals, saying that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> foundation and position but no person knew who would be challenging for the title late in the season, but did not feel it would between two people. Ferrari came into the event with {{a long series of}} success at the track, having won three of the last five races held at Istanbul Park. The team identified the event as their 800th Grand Prix and their cars carried a logo celebrating the achievement on their engine covers. Alonso was upbeat about their chances in the race, saying that compared to the Spanish Grand Prix, he felt their situation was a little better due to the fact Istanbul Park's characteristics are different and did not require the maximum amount of aerodynamic downforce, but a lower level which was suited to the F10. Alonso also believed it would be a [...] "surprise" [...] if the Red Bull team finished behind him. Hamilton claimed that McLaren would be competitive in Istanbul and hoped that he would secure his first victory of the season.|$|E

They took two young spinners, 20-year-old Alf Valentine and 21-year-old Sonny Ramadhin, who had only played two first-class matches each. Valentine in particular was a surprising choice as he had only taken two wickets in those matches {{at an average of}} 95, but somehow he had caught the eye of the West Indies captain, John Goddard.|$|E

2500|$|On December 14, 1963, new President Lyndon B. Johnson re-appointed Mann Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs. On December 21, Johnson {{also made}} Mann {{the head of}} the US Agency for International Development (USAID), an {{organization}} created by President Kennedy two years earlier. The double-appointment was opposed by the Kennedys and their liberal supporters, including Senator Hubert Humphrey and advisor Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.. Schlesinger wrote that Johnson's appointment of Mann constituted [...] "a declaration of independence, even perhaps a declaration of aggression against the Kennedys." [...] Members of the United States corporate establishment, generally felt <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> relationship with Mann and supported the appointment.|$|E

In addition, Michelle was unproductive and spent the morning drinking champagne in the VIP Room, while Samuel failed to drag in customers from the street, and Ruth gave Philip Green £66 of clothing than the £100 he asked for and never sold him anything else.

2500|$|Le Bon's ex-girlfriend, Fiona Kemp (a barmaid at the Rum Runner nightclub where Duran Duran were rehearsing), {{introduced}} him to the band in May 1980, recommending him as a potential vocalist. As band legend has it, he turned up for the audition wearing pink leopard-print trousers, and carrying a notebook containing a large collection of poems he had written—several of which would later become tracks on the early Duran Duran albums. After listening to the songs the band had already composed together, Le Bon spent some time fitting one of his poems ("Sound of Thunder") to one of the instrumentals, and found <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> match.
