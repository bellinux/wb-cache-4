5|$|On June 30, 2012, <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Attorney</b> {{brought a}} motion to remand Blythe in pre-trial detention, as he {{considered}} Blythe a flight risk. During a hearing conducted the same day, judge Petr Fassati of the Prague 8 District Court ruled that Blythe {{will be held on}} remand, with the possibility of a bail of CZK 4,000,000 (~ US$ 200,000), Blythe's alleged annual income; Blythe was held in Pankrác Prison. Bail was deposited in the court's bank account on mid-day of July 3, 2012. After this, <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Attorney</b> had three working days to either accept the bail or to challenge it by filing a complaint. Due to public holidays it was not until July 9, 2012, that <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Attorney</b> filed his complaint, which was to be dealt with by appellate court, the Prague Municipal Court.|$|E
5|$|On November 13, 2012, the {{spokesperson}} of the Prague State Attorney's Office {{announced that}} the police had formally closed their investigation and proposed to <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Attorney</b> to indict Blythe. After reviewing the case file, <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Attorney</b> indicted Blythe on the aforementioned charges on November 30, 2012. Two weeks later, a judge set the trial to commence on February 4, 2013, with a plan to conduct the hearings in four consecutive days. Blythe was summoned to attend the hearing in person.|$|E

50|$|Assistant <b>State's</b> <b>Attorney,</b> or <b>state</b> prosecutor, is <b>the</b> title {{applied to}} all {{attorneys}} working in a <b>state's</b> <b>attorney's</b> office, with <b>the</b> exception of <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> <b>attorney.</b> An assistant <b>state's</b> <b>attorney</b> (ASA) is hired or appointed to the position by <b>the</b> elected <b>state's</b> <b>attorney</b> and derives <b>the</b> power to act on behalf of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> in criminal prosecutions through <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> <b>attorney.</b>|$|R

5|$|A defense-appointed {{expert witness}} {{in the field of}} {{biomechanics}} testified on March 5 that Nosek could not turn 180 degrees during the fall and that should he be falling forward, he could not have sustained an injury {{to the back of his}} head. He further said that if Nosek fell over the first row of the fans, he must have been not only pushed, but must have jumped himself. <b>The</b> <b>State</b> <b>Attorney</b> immediately attacked this testimony, claiming that the expert witness omitted the conditions at the place and time, as well as some of the eyewitness testimonies, according to which Nosek fell onto his back from the beginning and did not turn during the fall. The presiding judge agreed with <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Attorney</b> on some of his points.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} heard {{by a panel}} of the Prague Municipal Court, {{consisting}} of presiding professional judge Tomáš Kubovec and two lay judges. Trials in the Czech Republic are public. In general, the court is bound to decide on the deed as stated in the indictment; however, it is not bound by its legal assessment by <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Attorney.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{permissive}} attitude toward business {{did not always}} extend toward large corporations. A lack of venture capital in the state became a significant problem with the early industry. Civic and business leaders, and even ordinary citizens, worried that the influx of capital from outside the state {{would lead to a}} loss of political power, revenue, and business opportunities. This sentiment led to a series of antitrust lawsuits by <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>Attorney</b> General starting in 1906. The lawsuits easily succeeded and limited the ability of outside investors, most notably Standard Oil, to gain control of the state oil companies.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>State</b> <b>Attorney's</b> Office {{represents}} <b>the</b> <b>state</b> {{in legal}} procedures.

50|$|Depending {{on state}} law, appeals are moved to appellate courts (also called appeals courts, courts of appeals, {{superior}} courts, or supreme courts in some <b>states).</b> During <b>the</b> appeals process <b>State's</b> <b>Attorneys,</b> in many cases, hands all relative prosecutorial materials to a State Appellate Prosecutor {{who in turn}} will represent <b>the</b> <b>state</b> in appellate courts with the advice and consent of <b>the</b> <b>State's</b> <b>Attorney.</b> <b>The</b> <b>State's</b> <b>Attorney</b> in small counties is responsible for grand jury indictments, motions, proceedings, and trying cases by jury or bench until verdict. In larger counties, <b>the</b> <b>State's</b> <b>Attorney</b> acts as an administrator and delegates most of the trial work to Assistant <b>State's</b> <b>Attorney</b> or Assistant District Attorneys.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} {{duties of}} <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> <b>attorney</b> are usually mandated by law and include representing <b>the</b> <b>State</b> in all criminal trials for crimes which occurred in <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> <b>attorney's</b> geographical jurisdiction. <b>The</b> geographical jurisdiction of a <b>state's</b> <b>attorney</b> may be delineated by {{the boundaries of}} a county, judicial circuit, or judicial district.|$|R
5|$|A year later, in October 1889, Eddy {{closed the}} Massachusetts Metaphysical College; {{according}} to Bates and Dittemore, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>attorney</b> was investigating colleges that were fraudulently graduating medical students. She also foreclosed the mortgage {{on the land}} in Boston the church had purchased, then purchased it herself for $5,000 through a middle man, though it was worth considerably more. She told the church they could have the land for their building on condition they formally dissolve the church; this was apparently intended to quash internal rebellions that had been bothering her. The following year she dissolved the National Christian Science Association. Wilson writes that the dissolutions allowed her to create a central church controlled by a five-person board of directors that answered only to her, which gave the church a stability that helped it survive her death.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{defendant}} and <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Attorney</b> may appeal the decision; the appeal would {{be heard by}} a panel of the Prague High Court, consisting of three professional judges. A decision of second instance court is final and enforceable. Nevertheless, an extraordinary appeal may be lodged by {{the defendant}} or the Supreme State Attorney, which would be heard by the Supreme Court of the Czech Republic in Brno; an extraordinary appeal may, however, rest only on issues of law and does not provide for full review of the case. After exhausting all of these remedies, the defendant may also lodge a petition to the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic. The petition may be based on allegation of violation of rights under the Czech Constitution and Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms.|$|E
5|$|In an {{arrangement}} that predates the 1951 City Charter, Philadelphia elects a District Attorney independent of the mayor's office. Dilworth had been elected to the office in 1951 but resigned in 1955 to run for mayor. Victor H. Blanc, a city councilman and former assistant district attorney, was elected to fill the unexpired term. Blanc was a veteran of both World Wars who, during his time on the council, led an investigation into corruption in construction at Philadelphia International Airport. In 1957, he ran for a full four-year term, but his connection with machine politics led Clark and Dilworth to withhold their endorsement of him. The Republican nominee was Emil F. Goldhaber, a local lawyer who had worked in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>attorney</b> general's office and in private practice. He was unopposed in the primary. The split in the Democratic leadership made the district attorney's race the liveliest of the campaign, according to Philadelphia Inquirer writer Joseph H. Miller.|$|E

50|$|Attorney General is {{managing}} and representing <b>State's</b> <b>Attorney</b> Office. According to The Act on <b>the</b> <b>State's</b> <b>Attorney</b> Office, any Croatian citizen meeting the general and special {{requirements for the}} appointment of a deputy in <b>the</b> <b>State’s</b> <b>Attorney</b> Office may be appointed as Attorney General.

5|$|On April 10, 2008, Ice {{was arrested}} in Palm Beach County on a battery charge for {{allegedly}} kicking and hitting his wife. He was released the following day after she declared {{that her husband had}} only pushed her. In court, the couple's neighbor, Frank Morales, stated that it was merely a verbal argument. Ice was ordered by a Florida court to stay away from his wife following his arrest, and to communicate with his children only if Morales accompanied him. The judge told Ice that he could only contact his wife via telephone. On April 29, 2008, Ice's lawyers, Bradford Cohen and Joseph LoRusso, were able to get the case dropped after providing <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>attorney</b> with evidence that conflicted with what was originally reported.|$|E
5|$|On July 17, 2012, Prague Municipal Court's {{panel of}} three judges headed by judge Luboš Vrba {{overturned}} the bail decision by doubling the bail amount to CZK 8 million (~ US$ 400,000). After this, <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Attorney</b> challenged {{the conditions of}} release, trying to achieve that the bail is subject to Blythe staying in the country and/or Blythe having to report at a given police station regularly until the criminal proceedings are finished. On August 2, 2012, the appellate court rejected the State Attorney's second complaint and ordered Blythe's immediate release. Blythe left the Czech Republic the next day, claiming {{in an interview with}} TV Nova that he would return for the trial.|$|E
5|$|Shepstone {{arrived in}} Pretoria in January 1877. He {{outlined}} criticisms expressed by Carnarvon regarding the Transvaal government and {{expressed support for}} federation. After a joint commission of inquiry on the British grievances—Kruger and <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Attorney</b> EJP Jorissen refuted most of Carnarvon's allegations, {{one of which was}} that Pretoria tolerated slavery—Shepstone stayed in the capital, openly telling Burgers he had come to the Transvaal to annex it. Hoping to stop the annexation by reforming the government, Burgers introduced scores of bills and revisions to a bewildered volksraad, which opposed them all but then passed them, heightening the general mood of discord and confusion. One of these reforms appointed Kruger to the new post of Vice-President.|$|E
50|$|The {{institution}} {{of a public}} attorney's office (<b>Attorney</b> General - <b>State</b> <b>Attorney)</b> {{has a long tradition}} in Serbia. Since the year of 1842, in, then existing, Principality of Serbia, <b>the</b> <b>State</b> Financial Manager (Правитељствени фишкал) was established as a separate organ of <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> with <b>the</b> competence to perform the duty of a <b>state</b> <b>attorney.</b> This separate organ of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> was abolished only after a year, and the function of a <b>state</b> <b>attorney's</b> office was sent back within the competence of the Ministry of finance. However, within that Ministry, the function of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>attorney's</b> office was always performed by particular employees - <b>State</b> <b>Attorney</b> (Правитељствени правобранитељ / Државни правобранитељ), of which fact we can find a trace in the Manual for a <b>State</b> <b>Attorney</b> from <b>the</b> year of 1848. In this form, <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Attorney's</b> Office existed in Serbia until the year of 1934, when a Law on <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Attorney's</b> Office came to power. By this Law, for the first time, the position and organization of <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Attorney's</b> Office as a separate organ of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> within <b>the</b> Ministry of finance, was established in whole details. After World War II, the name was changed to <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Attorney's</b> Office in <b>the</b> Public Attorney's Office, without essential change of competencies of this organ.|$|R

5|$|The {{constitution}} {{makes no}} mention of a lieutenant governor; if the governorship becomes vacant, the Senate President acts as governor. If more than one year remains in the governor's term at the time of vacancy, a new election is held; otherwise, the Senate President serves the remainder of the term. A bill passed in 2000 grants the Senate President the honorary title of Lieutenant Governor, but this title is rarely used in practice and the terms of the Senate President do not correspond with governorships. The same bill states that the line of succession after the Senate President will be the Speaker of the House of Delegates, followed by <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>attorney</b> general, the state auditor and former governors, in inverse order of term, that are in residence in the state {{at the time of the}} vacancy.|$|E
