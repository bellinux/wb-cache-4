5|$|Filling {{the void}} left by Barrett's {{departure}} in March 1968, Waters began to chart Pink Floyd's artistic direction. He became the principal songwriter, lyricist and co-lead vocalist (along with Gilmour, and at times, Wright), and would remain the band's dominant creative figure until his departure in 1985. He wrote {{the lyrics to}} the five Pink Floyd albums preceding his own departure, starting with <b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon (1973) and ending with The Final Cut (1983), while exerting progressively more creative control over the band and its music. Every Waters studio album since <b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon has been a concept album. With lyrics written entirely by Waters, <b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon {{was one of the}} most commercially successful rock albums ever. It spent 736 straight weeks on the Billboard 200 chart—until July 1988—and sold over 40 million copies worldwide. It was continuing to sell over 8,000 units every week as of 2005. According to Pink Floyd biographer Glen Povey, Dark Side of the Moon is the world's second best-selling album, and the United States' 21st best-selling album of all time.|$|E
5|$|Pink Floyd {{were founded}} by {{students}} Syd Barrett on guitar and lead vocals, Nick Mason on drums, Roger Waters on bass and vocals, and Richard Wright on keyboards and vocals. They gained popularity performing in London's underground music scene {{during the late}} 1960s, and under Barrett's leadership released two charting singles and a successful debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the band's primary lyricist and conceptual leader, devising the concepts behind their albums <b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977), The Wall (1979) and The Final Cut (1983). <b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon and The Wall became two of the best-selling albums of all time.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1970s, a bootleg {{containing}} rare {{singles and}} B-sides entitled <b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moo appeared, {{with a similar}} cover. Like Atom Heart Mother, the cover had no writing on it, although {{in this case it}} was to protect the bootlegger's anonymity rather than any artistic statement. The album cover to The KLF's concept album Chill Out was also inspired by Atom Heart Mother.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{assistant}} engineers {{working on the}} album was a 19-year-old Alan Parsons. He went on to engineer Pink Floyd's landmark album <b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon and produce many popular albums himself with the Alan Parsons Project.

5|$|Pink Floyd {{spent more}} than two weeks rehearsing in a hangar at Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, California, before opening on 29 March 1994, in Miami, with an almost {{identical}} road crew to that used for their Momentary Lapse of Reason tour. They played a variety of Pink Floyd favourites, and later changed their setlist to include <b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon in its entirety.

5|$|Pratchett had {{his writing}} {{breakthrough}} in 1968 when he interviewed Peter Bander van Duren, co-director {{of a small}} publishing company, Colin Smythe Ltd. During the meeting, Pratchett mentioned he had written a manuscript, The Carpet People. Colin Smythe Ltd published the book in 1971, with illustrations by the author. The book received strong, if few, reviews and {{was followed by the}} science fiction novels <b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun (10 May 1976) and Strata (15 June 1981).|$|E

5|$|Pratchett's {{first two}} adult novels, <b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun (1976) and Strata (1981), were both science-fiction, the latter taking place partly on a {{disc-shaped}} world. Subsequent to these, Pratchett mostly concentrated on his Discworld series and novels for children, with two exceptions: Good Omens (1990), a collaboration with Neil Gaiman (which {{was nominated for}} both Locus and World Fantasy Awards in 1991), a humorous story about the Apocalypse set on Earth, and Nation (2008), a book for young adults.|$|E
5|$|Richard William Wright (28 July 1943– 15 September 2008) was an English musician, composer, singer, and songwriter. He was {{a founder}} member, keyboardist, and vocalist of the {{progressive}} rock band Pink Floyd, performing on {{all but one of}} the group's albums including The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, <b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon, Wish You Were Here and The Division Bell, and playing on all of their tours.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon is {{the eighth}} album by English rock band Pink Floyd, {{released}} on 1 March 1973 by Harvest Records. The album built on ideas explored in earlier recordings and live shows, but lacks the extended instrumental excursions following {{the departure of}} founding member and principal contributor, Syd Barrett, in 1968, that characterised their earlier work. It thematically explores conflict, greed, the passage of time, and mental illness, the latter partly inspired by Barrett's deteriorating mental state.|$|E

5|$|The {{issue of}} piracy cropped up when a news article {{published}} in The Indian Express exposed <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film market. Hardly into weeks of the film's release, CDs were being sold at as low as Rs. 40. Another blemish was that Soumitra Dasgupta, a writer and close associate of Sarkar alleged that the film's story had {{a striking resemblance to}} his parallel work on the novella.|$|E
5|$|The main footage in {{and around}} the amphitheatre was filmed over four days in October 1971, using the band's regular touring equipment, {{including}} studio-quality 16-track tape recorders. Additional footage filmed in a Paris television studio the following December was added for the original 1972 release. The film was then re-released in 1974 with additional studio material of the band working on <b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon, and interviews at Abbey Road Studios.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, the Yugoslavian–U.S. co-production <b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun (1988) gave Pitt his first leading film role, {{as a young}} American taken by his family to the Adriatic to find a remedy for a skin condition. The film was shelved at the {{outbreak}} of the Croatian War of Independence, and was not released until 1997. Pitt made two motion picture appearances in 1989: the first in a supporting role in the comedy Happy Together; the second a featured role in the horror film Cutting Class, the first of Pitt's films to reach theaters. He made guest appearances on television series Head of the Class, Freddy's Nightmares, Thirtysomething, and (for a second time) Growing Pains.|$|E

5|$|Pink Floyd {{achieved}} international {{success with}} the concept albums <b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall. By the early 1980s, they {{had become one of}} the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful groups in the history of popular music; by 2013, they had sold more than 250 million albums worldwide. Amid creative differences, Waters left in 1985 and began a legal dispute with the remaining members over their use of the band's name and material. They settled out of court in 1987, and nearly eighteen years passed before he performed with them again.|$|E
5|$|Pink Floyd {{recorded}} <b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon between May 1972 and January 1973, with EMI staff engineer Alan Parsons at Abbey Road. The {{title is}} {{an allusion to}} lunacy rather than astronomy. The band had composed and refined the material on Dark Side while touring the UK, Japan, North America and Europe. Producer Chris Thomas assisted Parsons. Hipgnosis designed the album's packaging, which included George Hardie's iconic refracting prism design on the cover. Thorgerson's Dark Side album cover features a beam of white light, representing unity, passing through a prism, which represents society. The resulting refracted beam of coloured light symbolises unity diffracted, leaving an absence of unity. Waters is the sole author of the album's lyrics.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon {{was also}} re-released in 2003 on 180-gram virgin vinyl (mastered by Kevin Gray at AcousTech Mastering) and {{included}} slightly {{different versions of}} the original posters and stickers that came with the original vinyl release, along with a new 30th anniversary poster. In 2007 the album was included in Oh, by the Way, a box set celebrating the 40th anniversary of Pink Floyd, and a DRM-free version was released on the iTunes Store. In 2011 the album was re-released as part of the Why Pink Floyd...? campaign, featuring a remastered version of the album along with various other material.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon was {{released}} {{first in the}} US on 1 March 1973, {{and then in the}} UK on 16 March. It became an instant chart success in Britain and throughout Western Europe; by the following month, it had gained a gold certification in the US. Throughout March 1973 the band played the album as part of their US tour, including a midnight performance at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on 17 March before an audience of 6,000. The album reached the Billboard Top LP's & Tape chart's number one spot on 28 April 1973, and was so successful that the band returned two months later for another tour.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{something}} of a stopgap for the band, who had already started work on <b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon, and was recorded in two sessions in France between touring, with three days for mixing. The original plan was to just record small sections of music, but they ultimately created enough songs for a complete album. The resulting work has been overlooked in the Pink Floyd canon because of the huge commercial success of later albums, but still has a positive reaction from fans and critics.|$|E
5|$|The album's cover was, like {{several other}} Pink Floyd albums, {{designed}} by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. It {{consists of a}} photograph of a man sitting in a tree which has been taken out of focus to the point of complete distortion. Hipgnosis viewed a number of stills from the film on a 35mm projector, and liked the visual effect when the slide jammed. Schroeder later said the band did not want to make the cover particularly good as <b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon would have to compete with it, but Thorgerson insisted it was given proper consideration like any other Floyd album.|$|E
