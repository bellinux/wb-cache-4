5|$|About {{the time}} of the first landing in 1969, it was decided to use an {{existing}} Saturn V to launch the Skylab orbital laboratory pre-built on the ground, replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several Saturn IB launches; this eliminated Apollo 20. NASA's yearly budget also began <b>to</b> <b>shrink</b> <b>in</b> light of the successful landing, and NASA also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming Space Shuttle. By 1971, the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19. The two unused Saturn Vs became museum exhibits at the John F. Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida, George C. Marshall Space Center in Huntsville, Alabama, Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.|$|E
5|$|The area of low {{pressure}} gained sufficient shower activity and organization to be renamed as a tropical cyclone at 1800UTC on 10 March while located {{southwest of the}} Solomon Islands capital of Honiara. Erica gradually intensified, attaining the equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale (SSHS) Originally moving to the southeast at a slow pace, Erica began to accelerate due to the influence of weak mid–level ridge to its east. Continuing to intensify, the cyclone reached its peak intensity on 13 March with a minimum barometric pressure of , and peak winds of 260km/h (150mph 1-minute sustained). The eye of the cyclone began <b>to</b> <b>shrink</b> <b>in</b> diameter and become symmetrical. Later on 13 March, Erica began to parallel the western coast of New Caledonia while maintaining a strong intensity, before crossing the extreme southern end of the island at the Caledonian island commune of L'Île-des-Pins.|$|E

25|$|Ira Berkow, in his Maxwell Street, heads {{each chapter}} with a {{newspaper}} quotation showing a prevailing {{belief that the}} city was about to abolish the Maxwell market. The street itself began <b>to</b> <b>shrink</b> <b>in</b> 1926, when the Chicago River was straightened and new railroad tracks on its west bank pushed the east end of Maxwell Street further west. In 1957 the construction of the Dan Ryan Expressway cut Maxwell Street in two and pushed the market west of Union Street. In the 1990s the University of Illinois at Chicago began to expand south of Roosevelt Road, into the Maxwell Street area. A subsidized housing development called the Barbara Jean Wright Courts Apartments chopped off Maxwell's western end at Morgan Street (1000 west).|$|E
25|$|For a time, geopolitical {{events and}} natural {{disasters}} had strong short-term effects on oil prices, such as North Korean missile tests, the 2006 conflict between Israel and Lebanon, worries over Iranian nuclear plans in 2006, Hurricane Katrina, {{and various other}} factors. By 2008, such pressures appeared to have an insignificant impact on oil prices given {{the onset of the}} global recession. The recession caused demand for energy <b>to</b> <b>shrink</b> <b>in</b> late 2008, with oil prices collapsing from the July 2008 high of $147 to a December 2008 low of $32. Oil prices stabilized by August 2009 and generally remained in a broad trading range between $70 and $120 through November 2014, before returning to 2003 pre-crisis levels by early 2016.|$|E
25|$|Essentially, as a result, when light propagates {{through the}} {{cleavage}} plane and transits to free space {{from within the}} semiconductor crystal, {{a fraction of the}} light energy is absorbed by the surface states where it is converted to heat by phonon-electron interactions. This heats the cleaved mirror. In addition, the mirror may heat simply because the edge of the diode laser—which is electrically pumped—is in less-than-perfect contact with the mount that provides a path for heat removal. The heating of the mirror causes the bandgap of the semiconductor <b>to</b> <b>shrink</b> <b>in</b> the warmer areas. The bandgap shrinkage brings more electronic band-to-band transitions into alignment with the photon energy causing yet more absorption. This is thermal runaway, a form of positive feedback, and the result can be melting of the facet, known as catastrophic optical damage, or COD.|$|E

25|$|The Paleolithic {{is often}} held to finish {{at the end}} of the ice age (the end of the Pleistocene epoch), and Earth's climate became warmer. This may have caused or contributed to the {{extinction}} of the Pleistocene megafauna, although it is also possible that the late Pleistocene extinctions were (at least in part) caused by other factors such as disease and overhunting by humans. New research suggests that the extinction of the woolly mammoth may have been caused by the combined effect of climatic change and human hunting. Scientists suggest that climate change during the end of the Pleistocene caused the mammoths' habitat <b>to</b> <b>shrink</b> <b>in</b> size, resulting in a drop in population. The small populations were then hunted out by Paleolithic humans. The global warming that occurred during the end of the Pleistocene and the beginning of the Holocene may have made it easier for humans to reach mammoth habitats that were previously frozen and inaccessible. Small populations of wooly mammoths survived on isolated Arctic islands, Saint Paul Island and Wrangel Island, until BCE and BCE respectively. The Wrangel Island population became extinct around the same time the island was settled by prehistoric humans. There is no evidence of prehistoric human presence on Saint Paul island (though early human settlements dating as far back as 6500 BCE were found on the nearby Aleutian Islands).|$|E
500|$|Miller {{saved his}} best batting for the Shield clash with arch-rivals New South Wales, which started on Boxing Day at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). The {{visitors}} batted first and made 205, Miller taking 2/22 from ten overs. He then {{came to the}} crease on the first afternoon with Victoria at 1/31 after Meuleman was dismissed. Miller hammered three sixes from one over against Test team-mate Ernie Toshack, having started the over on three runs. After measuring up Toshack's bowling {{for the first two}} balls, Miller hooked the third ball over fine leg for six. He then lifted the sixth ball over square leg, was dropped by the bowler on the seventh ball, before driving the last ball into the crowd at long on. Miller reached his fifty in 41 minutes and was 79 at the close of play, with Victoria on 1/154. The next day, he fell for 153, ending a 271-run partnership with Merv Harvey that took just over three hours. It took another run out to terminate Miller's innings at 2/302. Miller's childhood hero Bill Ponsford said that Miller's display was the hardest hitting he had ever seen. The Sun-Pictorial opined that [...] "the M.C.G. seemed <b>to</b> <b>shrink</b> <b>in</b> size. It was reported that each time Keith shaped to Toshack the crowd in the boundary seats ducked." [...] Victoria declared at 8/560, Test teammates Lindwall and Toshack taking the most punishment with figures of 1/100 and 0/133 from 18 and 21 overs respectively. Miller then took 1/41—his 50th first-class wicket—and a catch as Victoria won by an innings and 114 runs.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{other systems}} were devised as the {{electric}} locomotive matured. [...] The Buchli drive was a fully spring-loaded system, {{in which the}} weight of the driving motors was completely disconnected from the driving wheels. First used in electric locomotives from the 1920s, the Buchli drive was mainly used by the French SNCF and Swiss Federal Railways. The quill drive was also developed about this time and mounted the traction motor above or {{to the side of the}} axle and coupled to the axle through a reduction gear and a hollow shaft - the quill - flexibly connected to the driving axle. The Pennsylvania Railroad GG1 locomotive used a quill drive. Again, as traction motors continued <b>to</b> <b>shrink</b> <b>in</b> size and weight, quill drives gradually fell out of favour.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Huastecs built small {{cities and}} {{ceremonial}} centers, they never reached {{the size and}} complexity of others in Mesoamerica. The northern areas were constantly threatened by the Chichimeca, {{which may be the}} origin for the traditional “Comanche” dance found in the region. [...] In the Post classic, Huastec territory began <b>to</b> <b>shrink.</b> <b>In</b> the west and south of their territory, there were enclaves of Nahuas, Tepehuas, Totonacs and Otomis. The Totonacs and Tepehuas in the region probably arrived around {{the same time as the}} Huastecs. The Otomis and Nahuas arrived later but the time line for these migrations is disputed. One Nahua incursion occurs in 800 CE related to Tula and the other due to the expansion of the Aztec Empire. The Aztecs conquered from the south and west to an area they called Chicoaque or Tzicoac in 1458, which was probably the area which is now Mesa de Cacahuatengo in the municipality of Ixhuatlán de Madero.|$|E
