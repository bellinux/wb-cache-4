The study embraces the theory that material culture reflects customs and values. The material culture indicators within the study are the architectural structures of the Oregon farms. <b>The</b> study <b>filters</b> <b>the</b> architecture through theoretical and historical data of both Oregon and the Upland South. The farms are recorded with oral history, photographs, architectural descriptions, and evolutionary settlement patterns. <b>The</b> <b>filtering</b> <b>process</b> <b>results</b> in two constructs that correlate the commonalities of both the Oregon farms and the Upland South architecture. The results point out that, with the disappearance of vernacular architecture on family farms, it follows that historic traditional cultures vanish...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{possibilities}} of using GIS (Geographic Information Sys-tem) data with an airborne autonomous vehicle developed in the WITAS project. Available for the thesis are high resolution (0. 16 meter sample interval) aerial pho-tographs over Stockholm, and vector data in a common GIS format containing all roads in the Stockholm area. A method for removing cars from aerial photographs is presented, using the filter-ing method normalized convolution, originally developed for filtering uncertain and incomplete data.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new method for {{implementing}} Karhunen–Loeve transform (KLT) -based speech enhancement to exploit vector quantization (VQ). The method {{is suitable for}} real-time processing. The proposed method consists of a VQ learning stage and a <b>filtering</b> stage. In <b>the</b> VQ learning stage, the autocorrelation vectors comprising the first$K$elements of the autocorrelation function are extracted from learning data. The autocorrelation vectors are used as codewords in the VQ codebook. Next, the KLT bases that correspond to all the codeword vectors are estimated through eigendecomposition (ED) of the empirical Toeplitz covariance matrices constructed from the codeword vectors. In <b>the</b> <b>filtering</b> stage, <b>the</b> autocorrelation vectors that are estimated from the input signal are compared to the codewords. The nearest one is chosen in each frame. The precomputed KLT bases corresponding to the chosen codeword are used for filtering instead of performing ED, which is computationally intensive. Speech quality evaluation using objective measures shows that the proposed method is comparable to a conventional KLT-based method that performs ED in <b>the</b> <b>filtering</b> <b>process.</b> <b>Results</b> of subjective tests also support this result. In addition, processing time is reduced to about 1 / 66 that of the conventional method in the case where a frame length of 120 points is used. This complexity reduction is attained after the computational cost in the learning stage and a corresponding increase in the associated memory requirement. Nevertheless, these results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces computational complexity while maintaining the speech quality of the KLT-based speech enhancement...|$|R
40|$|The {{singular}} diffusion equation called total variation (TV) flow {{plays an}} important role in image processing and appears to be suitable for reducing oscillations in other types of data. Due to its singularity for zero gradients, numerical discretizations have to be chosen with care. We discuss different ways to implement TV flow numerically, and we show that a number of discrete versions of this equation may introduce oscillations such that the scheme is in general not TV-decreasing. On the other hand, we show that TV flow may act self-stabilising: even if the total variation increases by <b>the</b> <b>filtering</b> <b>process,</b> <b>the</b> <b>resulting</b> oscillations remain bounded by a constant that is proportional to the ratio of mesh widths. For our analysis we restrict ourselves to the one-dimensional setting...|$|R

The clear-sky level was indicated by using a spectrum analyzer and a rain gauge whereby rain periods have been removed. The raw data were inspected visually to remove any spurious samples as much as possible resulting from loss of lock due to the satellite propellant saving option and satellite movement. The data were extracted by passing through a fifth-order high-pass Butterworth filter with a 0.04 -Hz cutoff frequency based on performing a spectral analysis. After <b>the</b> <b>filtering</b> <b>process,</b> <b>the</b> <b>resulting</b> data consists of positive (enhancement) and negative (fade) scintillation amplitude fluctuations above the mean level.

40|$|Thermal {{convective}} {{air flows}} are of great relevance in fundamental studies and technical {{applications such as}} heat exchangers or indoor ventilation. Since these kinds of flow are driven by temperature gradients, simultaneous measurements of instantaneous velocity and temperature fields are highly desirable. A possible solution is the combination of particle image velocimetry (PIV) and particle image thermography (PIT) using thermochromic liquid crystals (TLCs) as tracer particles. While combined PIV and PIT is already {{state of the art}} for measurements in liquids, this is not yet the case for gas flows. In this study we address the adaptation of the measuring technique to gaseous fluids with respect to the generation of the tracer particles, the particle illumination and <b>the</b> image <b>filtering</b> <b>process.</b> <b>Results</b> of <b>the</b> simultaneous PIV/PIT stemming from application to a fluid system with continuous air exchange are presented.

The available vector data is investigated with regard to its use in a simulator for vehicle movement, and {{is found to be}} missing much of the essential information needed in such a simulator. A new data format better suited to these requirements is created, using the extensible markup language (XML) which generates a humanreadable data format and can use existing parsers to make the implementation simpler. The result is a somewhat complex, but highly general data format that can accurately express almost any type of road and intersection. Cars can follow arbitrary paths in the road database and move with a smooth motion suitable for use as input to image processing equipment. The simulator does not allow any dynamic behaviour such as changing speeds, starting or stopping, or interaction between cars, takeovers or intelligent behavior in intersections. In the airborne vehicle, a mapping from pixels in a camera image (like the ones output from the simulator) to locations in the road database is needed. This is an inverse mapping with respect to visualizing as described above. This gives important information to a car tracking system regarding the probable movement of cars and also making it possible to determine if a car breaks traffic regulations. A mapping of this kind is created using a simplified form of ray tracing known as ray casting, together with space partitioning methods used to vastly improve efficiency. All above mentioned tasks are implemented using C++ and object oriented methods, giving maintainable and extendable code suiting a quickly changing research area. The interface to the simulator is designed to be compatible to the existing simulation software used in the WITAS project. Visualization is done through the OpenGL graphics library, providing realistic effects such as lighting and shading...|$|R

This method, applied in dynamic outdoor environments using a moving vehicle equipped with a laser scanner, is composed of a local simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with detection and tracking of moving objects (DATMO). While the SLAM is performed by an implementation of incremental scan matching method, the tracking if performed by a Multiple Hypothesis Tracker (MHT) coupled with an adaptive Interacting Multiple Models <b>Filter</b> (IMM). <b>The</b> classification <b>process</b> takes place in <b>the</b> <b>filtering</b> stage {{and is based on}} one of the key parameters of <b>the</b> IMM <b>filter</b> which is <b>the</b> Transition Probability Matrix (TPM) modeling objects motion transitions.

40|$|Order {{statistic}} and morphological filters {{belong to}} a class of nonlinear filters that have recently found many applications in signal analysis and image processing. In this paper, order statistic and morphological filters have been applied to enhance {{the features of the}} ultrasonic signal when it has been contaminated by multiple interfering microstructure echoes with random amplitudes and phases. These interfering echoes (i. e., speckles or grain scattering noise) often become significant to the point where detection of flaw echoes becomes very difficult. We have examined frequency diverse order statistic and time domain morphological and recursive median filters for improved ultrasonic flaw detection. In particular, the performance of these filters is evaluated using different ranks of order statistics and different shapes of structuring elements in the application of morphological <b>filters.</b> <b>The</b> <b>processed</b> experimental <b>results</b> in testing steel samples demonstrate that these filters are capable of improving flaw detection in ultrasonic systems...|$|R

This came in the guise of Unsolicited Commercial E-mail (UCE) or as it is otherwise known Spam. For a time spam was considered only a nuisance but due mainly to the copious amounts of spam being sent it has progressed from being a nuisance to become a major problem. The volume of spam has reached epidemic proportions with estimates of up to 80 % of all e-mail sent actually being spam. Spam filtering offers a way to curb the problem. Identifying and removal of spam from the e-mail delivery system allows end-users to regain a useful means of communication. A lot of research in spam filtering has been centred on more sophistication in the classifiers used. This thesis begins to investigate the impact of applying more sophistication to lower layers in <b>the</b> <b>filtering</b> <b>process,</b> namely extracting information from e-mail. Several types of obfuscation are discussed which are becoming ever more present in spam in order to try confuse and circumvent <b>the</b> current <b>filtering</b> <b>processes.</b> <b>The</b> <b>results</b> obtained by removing certain types of obfuscation show to improve the classification process.

To treat waste streams containing {sup 137 }Cs, {sup 90 }Sr, and actinides, SRS developed the Actinide Removal Process (ARP) and the Modular Caustic Side Solvent Extraction Unit (MCU). The Actinide Removal Process contacts the waste with monosodium titanate (MST) to sorb strontium and select actinides. After MST contact, <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>filters</b> <b>the</b> <b>resulting</b> slurry {{to remove the}} MST (with sorbed strontium and actinides) and any entrained sludge.
