5|$|A Sm3 derailed near Karjaa on 25 July 2003 due to {{a defect}} in a turnout. The train derailed at a low speed after {{mechanics}} turned <b>the</b> <b>turnout</b> blades manually into the correct position, but forgot to check <b>the</b> <b>turnout</b> frog, which was set to a diverging track. The first three carriages of the train derailed completely, {{in addition to the}} first bogie of the fourth car.|$|E
5|$|Elections {{are governed}} by the State Electoral Commission and electoral boards. Members of those bodies are {{required}} to have a university degree in law, {{and they may not}} be members of any political party. The State Electoral Commission prepares and manages elections in accordance with legislation, appoints lower-ranking election-commission and board members, issues directives to such bodies and supervises their work. The State Electoral Commission compiles and publishes candidate lists, supervises the legality of political campaigns and compiles and publishes election results. All members of election boards (or their legal deputies) must be present at assigned polling stations at all times while the polling station is open. The board verifies the identity of voters against the list of registered voters and records <b>the</b> <b>turnout.</b> <b>The</b> <b>turnout</b> number is later checked against number of votes cast; if the number of votes exceeds <b>the</b> <b>turnout,</b> the election at that polling station must be repeated. Votes are tallied by hand, and that information is forwarded (along with all other records kept at the polling station) to the State Electoral Commission.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{initially}} {{opposed the}} march outright, {{because he was}} concerned it would negatively impact the drive for passage of civil rights legislation. However, the organizers were firm that the march would proceed. With the march going forward, the Kennedys decided {{it was important to}} work to ensure its success. President Kennedy was concerned <b>the</b> <b>turnout</b> would be less than 100,000. Therefore, he enlisted the aid of additional church leaders and the UAW union to help mobilize demonstrators for the cause.|$|E

25|$|An {{improved}} junction replaces <b>the</b> diamond with <b>turnouts,</b> {{which can}} be of as fine an angle as possible, so that this junction can carry branch traffic at high speed. This configuration assumes power operation of the points, as high speed turnouts are generally not suitable for mechanical operation. <b>The</b> high speed <b>turnouts</b> may require more than one point machine each. <b>The</b> <b>turnouts</b> can have no superelevation while the curve in the branch can; therefore the radius in <b>the</b> <b>turnouts</b> must be greater than the radius of the curve in the branch.|$|R

5|$|Pećanac was {{the most}} {{prominent}} figure in the Chetnik movement during the interwar period. During the 1920 Constitutional Assembly elections, Prime Minister Nikola Pašić sent Pećanac to the Sandžak with orders to intimidate the local Muslim population {{in the hope of}} keeping <b>the</b> <b>turnout</b> low. In the same year, attempts by the Yugoslav government to disarm and conscript Kosovo Albanians were met by revolts. Pećanac was sent to Kosovo to form detachments made up of local Serbs to fight the rebels. This resulted in rebel attacks on Serb villages.|$|E
5|$|TNA {{officials}} were unhappy with <b>the</b> <b>turnout</b> of the Ultimate X match at Bound for Glory, {{this was due}} to the technically difficulties involved. A rematch was announced on the October29 episode of Impact!.

Williams versus Styles for the title was promoted for Genesis after this by TNA. Styles retained the championship at the event.|$|E

At the 2007 local elections, two of those seats were won by the Conservative Party and one by an independent candidate. Conservative candidates in the ward won 45.8% of the vote, independent candidates won 27.0%, Labour Party candidates 17.6% and a Grey Party candidate 4.6%. <b>The</b> <b>turnout</b> was 34.5%.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>turnouts</b> for <b>the</b> loop siding came due {{for renewal}} in 1959 {{and it was}} {{suggested}} that perhaps the siding should be closed altogether. It was noted that the dairy company, which had been the main user of the siding, was planning to switch production to casein which would only require irregular shipments. The District Traffic Manager advised that the traffic for the siding was still such that the siding could not be closed and it was therefore decided to proceed with the renewal of <b>the</b> <b>turnouts.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{the state}} {{elections}} of 2012, during which {{all members of}} the legislature (but not the governor) were up for election, the shutdown was a major campaign issue. The Republicans lost their majorities in both houses of the legislature, giving the DFL full control of the state government. Kurt Zellers and other Republican legislators said the shutdown probably was one reason for their electoral defeat. However, other national and state issues may have had more of an influence on the result. The presidential race was also on the ballot, as were the proposed Minnesota Marriage Amendment and Voter ID Amendment, which had been put on the ballot by the legislature in 2011. All of these ballot items increased <b>the</b> <b>turnout</b> of DFL-leaning voters.|$|E
5|$|Peach Bowl {{officials}} pronounced themselves {{pleased with}} both <b>the</b> <b>turnout</b> {{for the game}} and the action on the field. Though traffic jams snarled attendees' arrival to the stadium, there were only 5,366 no-shows out of 58,212tickets sold. Following the game, Peach Bowl chairman Ira Hefter announced that the bowl would seek corporate sponsorship and a potential television broadcast deal with a major American television network. The takeover by the chamber of commerce also proved to be successful, as the 1986 game made a small profit. This was an improvement over the three previous Peach Bowls, which lost more than $170,000. The sellout also confirmed that the game would continue to be held annually instead of being abandoned, as sportswriters had speculated prior to the 1986 game.|$|E
5|$|On 25 April 1991, the Croatian Parliament {{decided to}} hold an {{independence}} referendum on 19 May. The decision {{was published in the}} official gazette of the Republic of Croatia and made official on 2 May 1991. The referendum offered two options. In the first, Croatia would become a sovereign and independent state, guaranteeing cultural autonomy and civil rights to Serbs and other minorities in Croatia, free to form an association of sovereign states with other former Yugoslav republics. In the second, Croatia would remain in Yugoslavia as a unified federal state. Serb local authorities called for a boycott of the vote, which was largely followed by Croatian Serbs. The referendum was held at 7,691 polling stations, where voters were given two ballots—blue and red, with a single referendum option each, allowing use of either or both of ballots. The referendum question proposing independence of Croatia, presented on the blue ballot, passed with 93.24% in favor, 4.15% against, and 1.18% of invalid or blank votes. The second referendum question, proposing that Croatia should remain in Yugoslavia, was declined with 5.38% votes in favor, 92.18% against and 2.07% of invalid votes. <b>The</b> <b>turnout</b> was 83.56%.|$|E
50|$|Voter <b>turnout</b> across <b>the</b> Netherlands {{was around}} 58%, {{slightly}} {{more than in the}} 2002 municipal elections. Delfzijl was said to have <b>the</b> lowest <b>turnout</b> of <b>the</b> whole country, with 47.3% but this was due to 22% of the cast Delfzijl votes being blank, as a form of protest against the political mismanagement that entangled the city last year. <b>The</b> Delfzijl <b>turnout</b> with <b>the</b> blank votes included was 61.1%. <b>The</b> real lowest <b>turnouts</b> were in <b>the</b> major cities Eindhoven and The Hague, each with 47.5%. <b>The</b> highest <b>turnouts</b> are traditionally in smaller communities and especially at the Wadden islands in the North. <b>The</b> highest <b>turnout</b> this year was at Ameland with 87.3%.|$|R
