50|$|While many {{association}} {{studies have}} identified unusual expression of long ncRNAs in disease states, {{there is little}} understanding of their role in causing disease. Expression analyses that compare tumor cells and normal cells have revealed changes in the expression of ncRNAs in several forms of cancer. For example, in prostate tumours, PCGEM1 (one of two overexpressed ncRNAs) is correlated with increased proliferation and colony formation suggesting an involvement in regulating cell growth. MALAT1 (also known as NEAT2) was originally identified as an abundantly expressed ncRNA that is upregulated during metastasis of early-stage {{non-small cell lung cancer}} and its overexpression is an early prognostic marker for poor patient survival rates. More recently, the highly conserved mouse homologue of MALAT1 was found to be highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma. Intronic antisense ncRNAs with expression correlated to the degree of <b>tumor</b> <b>differentiation</b> in prostate cancer samples have also been reported. Despite a number of long ncRNAs having aberrant expression in cancer, their function and potential role in tumourogenesis is relatively unknown. For example, the ncRNAs HIS-1 and BIC have been implicated in cancer development and growth control, but their function in normal cells is unknown. In addition to cancer, ncRNAs also exhibit aberrant expression in other disease states. Overexpression of PRINS is associated with psoriasis susceptibility, with PRINS expression being elevated in the uninvolved epidermis of psoriatic patients compared with both psoriatic lesions and healthy epidermis.|$|E

40|$|The <b>differentiation</b> {{stage of}} <b>tumors</b> {{is a central}} aspect in the histopathological {{classification}} of solid malignancies. The differentiation stage is strongly associated with tumor behavior, and generally an immature tumor is more aggressive than the more differentiated counterpart. While this is common knowledge in surgical pathology, the contribution of differentiation-related gene expression and functions to tumor behavior is often overlooked in the experimental, tumor biological setting. The mechanisms by which <b>tumor</b> cell <b>differentiation</b> stages are perturbed or affected are poorly explored but have recently come into focus with the introduction. of the tumor stem cell concept.

Suramin inhibited tumor cell growth. Development of intracytoplasmic lumina and intercellular lumina was noted in suramin-containing culture with formation of numerous microvilli and frequent desmosomes. The amount of CEA released by a cell was increased in suramin-containing culture. Suramin inhibited heterotransplantation, and a transplant from suramin-containing culture revealed a much higher degree of differentiation than that from suramin-absent culture. Suramin induced no change in DNA ploidy pattern. Elimination of suramin from the culture medium did not reverse the <b>tumor</b> cell <b>differentiation.</b> Each stomach cancer cell line showed a different degree of responsiveness to suramin.

40|$|Abstract Background The use of retinoids as {{anti-cancer}} agents {{has been}} limited due to resistance and low efficacy. The dynamics of nuclear receptor coregulation are incompletely understood. Cell-and context-specific activities of nuclear receptors may be {{in part due to}} distinct coregulator complexes recruited to distinct subsets of target genes. RIP 140 (also called NRIP 1) is a ligand-dependent corepressor that is inducible with retinoic acid (RA). We had previously shown that RIP 140 limits RA induced <b>tumor</b> cell <b>differentiation</b> of embryonal carcinoma; the pluriopotent stem cells of testicular germ cell tumors. This implies that RIP 140 represses key genes required for RA-mediated <b>tumor</b> cell <b>differentiation.</b> Identification of these genes would be of considerable interest. Results To begin to address this issue, microarray technology was employed to elucidate in a de novo fashion the global role of RIP 140 in RA target gene regulation of embryonal carcinoma. Subclasses of genes were affected by RIP 140 in distinct manners. Interestingly, approximately half of the RA-dependent genes were unaffected by RIP 140. Hence, RIP 140 appears to discriminate between different classes of RA target genes. In general, RIP 140 -dependent gene expression was consistent with RIP 140 functioning to limit RA signaling and <b>tumor</b> cell <b>differentiation.</b> Few if any genes were regulated in a manner to support a role for RIP 140 in "active repression". We also demonstrated that RIP 140 silencing sensitizes embryonal carcinoma cells to low doses of RA. Conclusion Together the data demonstrates that RIP 140 has profound effects on RA-mediated gene expression in this cancer stem cell model. The RIP 140 -dependent RA target genes identified here may be particularly important in mediating RA-induced <b>tumor</b> cell <b>differentiation</b> and the findings suggest that RIP 140 may be an attractive target to sensitize tumor cells to retinoid-based differentiation therapy. We discuss these data in the context of proposed models of RIP 140 -mediated repression. </p...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Each {{pathological}} {{stage of}} {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) {{consists of a}} heterogeneous population containing patients at much higher risk than others. Noninvasive functional imaging modalities, such as 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), could play a role in further characterization of NSCLCs. As many factors can influence the extent of FDG uptake, the underlying mechanisms for FDG accumulation in tumors, are still a matter of debate. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate these possible mechanisms in the primary site of early stage preoperatively untreated NSCLC. METHODS: 19 patients with early stage NSCLC, who had undergone both preoperative FDG-PET imaging and curative surgery, were enrolled in this study. Standardized uptake values (SUVs) were used for evaluation of primary tumor FDG uptake. Final diagnosis, tumor type, <b>tumor</b> cell <b>differentiation</b> and size of the primary tumors were confirmed histopathologically in resected specimens. Histologic sections were analyzed for amount of inflammation and necrosis. Expression of the glucose membrane transporters (GLUT- 1 and GLUT- 3); the isoforms of the glycolytic enzyme hexokinase (HK-I, HK-II and HK-III); and the cysteine protease caspase- 3, was evaluated immunohistochemically. RESULTS: FDG uptake was significantly higher in squamous cell carcinomas (mean SUV 13. 4 +/- 4. 9, n= 8) compared to adenocarcinomas (7. 1 +/- 3. 3, n= 8, p= 0. 007), or large cell carcinomas (5. 9 +/- 1. 9, n= 3, p= 0. 02). The degree of FDG accumulation seemed to depend especially on GLUT- 1, GLUT- 3 and <b>tumor</b> cell <b>differentiation.</b> The summed standardized values of these three parameters correlated significantly with the SUV (r= 0. 47, p= 0. 05). CONCLUSION: The present study supports the hypothesis that <b>tumor</b> cell <b>differentiation</b> in combination with overexpression of GLUT- 1 and GLUT- 3 determine the extent of FDG accumulation and that squamous cell carcinomas accumulate more FDG than adenocarcinomas or large cell carcinomas...|$|R
