5000|$|Stroker and Hoop is an American Adobe Flash {{animated}} {{television series}} on Cartoon Network's late night programming block, Adult Swim. The series is {{a parody of}} buddy cop films and television series such as Starsky & Hutch, and stars the voices of Jon Glaser as Stroker and Timothy [...] "Speed" [...] Levitch as Hoop. It contains the <b>talking</b> <b>car</b> element of the 1982 series Knight Rider, in [...] "C.A.R.R.", voiced by Paul Christie. The names of the lead characters may be based on two Burt Reynolds characters, from Stroker Ace and Hooper.|$|E
5000|$|C.A.R.R. (Paul Christie) - Stroker and Hoop's primary mode of transportation, C.A.R.R. is a <b>talking</b> <b>car</b> {{that was}} {{state-of-the-art}} twenty years ago. He enjoys talk radio and car washes, {{perhaps a little}} too much. He is also vengeful, paranoid, a bit racist, and often demonstrates effeminate behavior and, {{in spite of his}} otherwise masculine personality. He is a parody of Michael Knight's car KITT from Knight Rider and the name [...] "C.A.R.R." [...] is a parody of [...] "K.A.R.R.", KITT's [...] "evil" [...] prototype. C.A.R.R. is painted to somewhat resemble the Ford Torino from Starsky & Hutch.|$|E
5000|$|As head of NBC's Entertainment Division, Tartikoff's successes {{included}} The Cosby Show, {{for which}} he had pursued Bill Cosby to create a pilot after having been impressed by Cosby's stories when Cosby guest-hosted The Tonight Show. Tartikoff wrote a brainstorming memo that simply read [...] "MTV cops", and later presented the memo to series creator Anthony Yerkovich, formerly a writer and producer for Hill Street Blues. The result was Miami Vice, which became an icon of 1980s pop culture. Knight Rider was inspired by a perceived lack of leading men who could act, with Tartikoff suggesting that a <b>talking</b> <b>car</b> could fill in the gaps in any leading man's acting abilities.|$|E
50|$|Tom and Ray {{continued}} to work in their garage while they produced <b>Car</b> <b>Talk.</b> On June 8, 2012, {{it was announced that}} <b>Car</b> <b>Talk</b> would stop producing new episodes in September 2012, though NPR will continue airing reruns of the show.|$|R
50|$|Yugo Critics and Defenders The Yugo was {{subjected}} to derision by critics who pointed to its use of old-generation Fiat technology and to alleged issues with build quality and reliability. The Yugo was voted <b>Car</b> <b>Talk</b> 's worst <b>car</b> of the millennium.|$|R
5000|$|King recalled, [...] "My {{brother had}} a car that he kept in the alley with a fellow {{by the name of}} Bill Gannon and some others. Id go to his house on Sunday, and wed go down the alley and run into {{somebody}} else and <b>talk</b> <b>cars.</b> That was the beginning of Gasoline Alley." [...] After King began the daily Gasoline Alley strip (August 24, 1919), The Rectangle appeared sporadically and finally came to an end on February 8, 1920.|$|R
50|$|Characters, {{as well as}} plots, were {{typically}} run of the mill for the time. For example, most episodes of Ghostbusters had the same scheme (bad guys develop an evil plan, the heroes are needed but always absent, Ghost Buggy the <b>talking</b> <b>car</b> complains about their dangerous position, Tracey the Gorilla pulls out of his back pack exactly the miscellaneous item the Ghostbuster needs {{in a moment of}} despair, Eddie doing a number of clumsy/stupid things etc.). Although as previously mentioned, Filmation made various attempts to rise above the norm. Many of the sound effects used in its cartoons are also very familiar, the majority of them being recycled from Hanna-Barbera (though this was, and still is a common trait among animation companies, though Filmation's copies of the Hanna-Barbera sound effects were of a distinctively lower quality), though the company's DC Comics cartoons of 1966-7 used more realistic sound effects.|$|E
5000|$|The {{music video}} was {{released}} on 29 April 2013, directed by Chris Marrs Piliero. It features a gothic theme, being set in a 'spooky, dark, [...] "Addams Family"-esque high school'. The video features product placement from Sony and Mini. Mika uses a Sony Xperia Z to text an invitation for a dinner party to his popular classmates who are bullying him. This is interlaced with scenes of the two brewing a potion in a witch's cauldron and scenes of them falling victim to bullying. Mika and Grande return to Mika's mansion in his <b>talking</b> <b>car,</b> a 2013 Mini Cooper. At the dinner party, the bullies consume their drinks drugged with the potion, and turn to stone. They are then ruthlessly smashed into pieces by Mika and Grande, with the former using a candlestick and the latter using a food tray. However, the video ends with a twist: [...] as Mika and Grande have a toast and the former takes a sip from his drink, the video flashes back to when the two were children and Mika is seen kicking down Grande's castle made of wooden blocks. As Grande glares coldly at him, Mika subsequently turns to stone as well. The video then ends with Grande sipping her drink as she smirks evilly at the camera. The gothic theme of the video and its vengeful nature, {{as well as the}} costume worn by Mika as he and Grande are shown 'cooking', is generally considered reminiscent of the aesthetic and plot of the Stephen Sondheim musical Sweeney Todd, tying back to the musical theatre roots of the song established in modifying a song from Wicked.|$|E

50|$|Their {{debut in}} {{television}} commercials on May 1, 1995 featured <b>talking</b> <b>cars</b> done in clay animation, {{with a variety}} of car colors each with different personalities. The commercials themselves, done in a similar fashion to Creature Comforts, were crafted by Aardman Animations and used to promote Chevron with Techron. A year later, Chevron gas stations began selling the toy cars featured in the commercials. Chevron underestimated demand in 1997 and increased production to 700,000 on each of 4 or 5 new models at the time, compared to 500,000 in the previous year.|$|R
50|$|Later, {{walking in}} the neighborhood, Don runs into some hotrodders and is excited to <b>talk</b> <b>cars</b> and racing with them. He tells them {{he is looking for}} a job. He helps Anna around the house, and later, he finds the copy of Meditations in an Emergency that he sent Anna in the first episode of Season 2. Anna reads his tarot, and tells him he is part {{of the world and the}} only thing keeping him from being happy is the feeling that he's alone. Don walks to the ocean and lets the waters wash over him.|$|R
5000|$|Tom’s {{style of}} {{speaking}} {{is a key}} component of his comic nature. He speaks only in short staccato sentences similar to a telegram: [...] "Can’t <b>talk</b> Alison. <b>Car</b> being towed. Problem with lawn furniture." ...|$|R
