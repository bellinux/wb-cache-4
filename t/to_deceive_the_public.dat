6000|$|Shall I {{tell the}} real reason why I have unintentionally succeeded in fooling so many people? It is because some of them only read {{a little of the}} squib I wrote and jumped to the {{conclusion}} that it was serious, and the rest did not read it at all, but heard of my agricultural venture at second-hand. Those cases I could not guard against, of course. To write a burlesque so wild that its pretended facts will not be accepted in perfect good faith by somebody, is very nearly an impossible thing to do. It is because, in some instances, the reader is a person who never tries to deceive anybody himself, and therefore is not expecting any one to wantonly practise a deception upon him; and in this case the only person dishonoured is the man who wrote the burlesque. In other instances the [...] "nub" [...] or moral of the burlesque--if its object be to enforce a truth--escapes notice in the superior glare of something {{in the body of the}} burlesque itself. And very often this [...] "moral" [...] is tagged on at the bottom, and the reader, not knowing that it is the key of the whole thing and the only important paragraph in the article, tranquilly turns up his nose at it and leaves it unread. One can deliver a satire with telling force through the insidious medium of a travesty, if he is careful not to overwhelm the satire with the extraneous interest of the travesty, and so bury it from the reader's sight and leave him a joked and defrauded victim, when the honest intent was to add to either his knowledge or his wisdom. I have had a deal of experience in burlesques and their unfortunate aptness <b>to</b> <b>deceive</b> <b>the</b> <b>public,</b> and this is why I tried hard to make that agricultural one so broad and so perfectly palpable that even a one-eyed potato could see it; and yet, as I speak the solemn truth, it fooled one of the ablest agricultural editors in America! ...|$|E

50|$|Conspiracies in {{violation}} of the federal securities laws such as the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 form another area where intense civil and criminal lawsuits occur over the existence or non-existence of an alleged conspiracy. Both the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice bring legal actions for conspiracies to violate the securities laws. For example,a regional bank called PNC Financial Services Group Inc. through a subsidiary agreed, in June 2003, to pay $115 million in civil fines and restitution to settle the SEC's allegations of securities fraud. The subsidiary was accused of conspiracy to violate securities laws by transferring $762 million in troubled loans and investments to off-balance-sheet entities in 2001. In that case, the Justice Department deferred prosecution of PNC, citing its cooperation in a related investigation. Similarly, the civil litigation against the tobacco companies to recover health care costs, alleges a conspiracy under the Medical Care Recovery Act, , et seq.

He later added the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in support of his Free Exercise claim, citing that the use of the name [...] "Creation Seventh Day Adventist" [...] was mandated by his religion. The jury trial was initially rescheduled from January 2008 to June, but was further delayed. In the interim, on June 11, the Tennessee district court judge issued a partial summary judgment on behalf of the plaintiff that the name [...] "Seventh-day Adventist" [...] could not be used in the promotion of the church's materials or services at any locality in the United States, despite the Judge's conclusion that the Church took the name as a result of divine revelation with no intent <b>to</b> confuse or <b>deceive</b> <b>the</b> <b>public.</b> As of May 27, 2009, a recommendation for permanent injunction was adopted by the Court against McGill and the Church enjoining them from using the names [...] "Seventh-day Adventist," [...] "Seventh-day," [...] "Adventist," [...] or the acronym [...] "SDA" [...] either alone or in conjunction with modifying terms, with an order to submit a sworn notice of compliance to the Court by June 17, 2009.
