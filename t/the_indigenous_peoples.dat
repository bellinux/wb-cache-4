5|$|Bartolomé de las Casas spent 50 {{years of}} his life {{actively}} fighting slavery and the violent colonial abuse of indigenous peoples, especially by trying to convince the Spanish court to adopt a more humane policy of colonization. Unlike the other priests who sought to destroy all of <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> native books and writings, he was strictly opposed to this action. Although he failed to save <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> of the Western Indies, his efforts resulted in several improvements in the legal status of the natives, and in an increased colonial focus on the ethics of colonialism. Las Casas is often seen {{as one of the first}} advocates for universal conception of human dignity (later human rights).|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{employ the}} theory of deconstruction to {{challenge}} and reject the contention that a knowledge paradigm was non-existent among <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people</b> of Zimbabwe {{before the arrival of}} the colonisers. This is necessary because the imposition of the colonisers’ knowledge paradigm was premised on the supposed absence of an epistemology among <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people.</b> In defending <b>the</b> thesis that education and indeed an epistemology was in existence among <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people</b> of Zimbabwe, we submit that education is part of any given culture. In the light of this, it becomes untenable to deny the existence of education among <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people</b> of Zimbabwe before the arrival of the colonisers. Knowledge ceases to be the exclusive preserve of the colonisers. It must be noted that the imposition of the colonisers’ knowledge paradigm was accompanied by the suppression and partial destruction of the epistemology of <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people.</b> <b>The</b> suppression and partial destruction of <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people’s</b> epistemological paradigm is called epistemicide. The epistemicide that the colonisers inflicted on <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people</b> led to <b>the</b> exclusive dominance of their knowledge paradigm in the school curriculum at the expense of that of <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people.</b> In <b>the</b> light of this status quo, we present transformation and Africanisation as corrective to the unjustified dominance of the present day curriculum by the epistemological paradigm of the colonisers. We argue that despite the commendable proposals contained in the Report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Education and Training (1999 : 24) to change the curriculum so that unhu/ubuntu becomes its organising principle and to allow the co-existence of <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people’s</b> epistemological paradigm and others, in practice the dominance of the colonisers’ epistemological paradigm remains in place. We submit that the Africanisation of the curriculum is a matter of justice that demands the end of the dominance of the knowledge paradigm of the colonisers and the co-existence of <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people’s</b> knowledge paradigm and othersPhilosophy, Practical and Systematic TheologyD.

5|$|Insects {{have been}} used medicinally in {{cultures}} around the world, often according to the Doctrine of Signatures. Thus, the femurs of grasshoppers, which were said to resemble the human liver, were used to treat liver ailments by <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> of Mexico. The doctrine was applied in both Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and in Ayurveda. TCM uses arthropods for various purposes; for example, centipede is used to treat tetanus, seizures, and convulsions, while the Chinese Black Mountain Ant, Polyrhachis vicina, {{is used as a}} cure all, especially by the elderly, and extracts have been examined as a possible anti-cancer agent. Ayurveda uses insects such as Termite for conditions such as ulcers, rheumatic diseases, anaemia, and pain. The Jatropha leaf miner's larvae are used boiled to induce lactation, reduce fever, and soothe the gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, the traditional insect medicine of Africa is local and unformalised. <b>The</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> of Central America used a wide variety of insects medicinally. Mayans used Army ant soldiers as living sutures. The venom of the Red harvester ant was used to cure rheumatism, arthritis, and poliomyelitis via the immune reaction produced by its sting. Boiled silkworm pupae were taken to treat apoplexy, aphasy, bronchitis, pneumonia, convulsions, haemorrhages, and frequent urination.|$|E

50|$|Climate changes {{undermine}} {{the daily lives}} of the Native peoples on many levels. For example, to immediately deal with these conditions, <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people</b> adjust when they harvest and what they harvest and also adjust their resource use. Climate change can change the accuracy of the information of traditional ecological knowledge. <b>The</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people</b> have relied deeply on indicators in nature to plan activities and even for short- term weather predictions. As a result of even more increasing unfavorable conditions, <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people</b> relocate to find other ways to survive. As a result, there is a loss of cultural ties to the lands they once resided on and there is also a loss to the traditional ecological knowledge they had with the land there. Climate change adaptations not properly structured or implemented can harm <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people's</b> rights.|$|R
5|$|Many Indians {{who joined}} the {{missions}} were looking for protection from Portuguese slave traders or the encomienda system of the Spanish conquistadores.

5|$|Early Mormons {{understood}} the Book of Mormon to be a religious history of <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> of the Americas.

Modern historian Fawn Brodie has called the Book of Mormon a response to pressing cultural and environmental issues of Smith's times, saying that Smith composed the Book of Mormon drawing from scraps of information available to him. Dan Vogel, another historian, says that the work is autobiographical in nature.|$|E
50|$|In {{the framing}} {{of the land}} grant conditions, no {{provisions}} were made for <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people</b> of <b>the</b> area, who were incorrectly thought to be nomads with no claim to the land over which they travelled.

As more and more land was granted and fenced off, <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people</b> were increasingly denied access to their sacred sites and traditional hunting grounds.

5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium is a hardy, herbaceous, rhizomatous, {{perennial}} sedge, able {{to endure}} {{in a variety}} of environments in the temperate, subarctic and arctic regions of Earth. Unlike Gossypium, the genus from which cotton is derived, the bristles which grow on E.angustifolium are unsuited to textile manufacturing. Nevertheless, in Northern Europe, they were used as a substitute in the production of paper, pillows, candle-wicks, and wound-dressings. <b>The</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> of North America use the plant in cooking and in the treatment of digestive problems. Following a vote in 2002, Plantlife International designated E.angustifolium the County Flower of Greater Manchester, as part of its British County Flowers campaign.|$|E
5|$|In 1542, the New Laws {{were issued}} {{with the aim}} of {{protecting}} <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> of the Spanish colonies from their overexploitation by the encomenderos. In an effort to enforce the New Laws, a fleet of 27 ships set out from Spain on 19 July 1544, carrying friar Bartolomé de las Casas and his religious followers. Las Casas arrived in Ciudad Real with 16 fellow Dominicans on 12 March 1545. The Dominicans were the first religious order to attempt the evangelisation of the native population. Their arrival meant that the colonists were no longer free to treat the natives as they saw fit without the risk of intervention by the religious authorities.|$|E
