50|$|Artwork at {{the station}} follows the themes of a celebration of trees and the history Orenco, once the company town of the west coast's largest nursery, the Oregon Nursery Company. Part of this comes from a grove of trees {{adjacent}} to the station that were purchased {{at the behest of}} the artists in charge of the artwork for the stop, Fernanda D'Agostino, Jerry Mayer, Valerie Otani and Bill Will. Individual works of art include the Rings of Memory Plaza which consists of concentric circles of granite inscribed with text by Kim Stafford. Another item is a gravel path with stone seat walls leading to an old oak grove entitled the Witness <b>Tree</b> <b>Rest,</b> which includes another line by Stafford inscribed on the granite threshold to the east end of the path. The Grafted Path which connects the station to NW 231st Avenue illustrates the grafting method that distinguished Oregon Nursery Company trees. East of the station is the Grove of Perspective, made up of rows of trees that create optical effects when viewed from the moving train.|$|E

5000|$|The {{basis for}} this family <b>tree</b> <b>rests</b> upon the trinubium, the {{tradition}} that Anne had married three times. The exact lineage, as laid out in Jacobus de Voragine’s Golden Legend (Latin: Legenda Aurea), runs thus: ...|$|R
60|$|The top of {{the tree}} had come {{straight}} through the big window of the apartment, crashing down on a bureau and a writing-desk, smashing both flat. Some branches of the <b>tree</b> <b>rested</b> {{on the side of}} the bed, pinning Job Haskers against the wall, as if in a cage.|$|R
5000|$|The {{description}} of the Blessed Virgin Mary according to Nieva's personalized statue is distinct. The Virgin Mary wears a long white tunic, and stands atop a (Guava) <b>tree</b> <b>resting</b> on a cloud decorated with seven roses. The virgin has a six-pointed star on the forehead, and has a [...] "Sailor knot" [...] featuring a tassel and a golden chain ball hanging from her chest.|$|R
50|$|Hunter went on:The {{locomotive}} was, {{like some}} great folk, before its time, {{as they had}} not yet discovered a way for its will. The road {{that used to be}} trod by the auld horse was in some places high in the centre, and on those heights did the teeth wheels on the axle <b>trees</b> <b>rest,</b> bending both them and the rods by which motion was attained. As a power out of place, the giant had to be laid aside for a time.|$|R
50|$|The Prince {{appears in}} search of the Princess. He is despondent, sorrowful and tired. He sits down next to a large <b>tree</b> to <b>rest</b> and falls asleep.|$|R
6000|$|Then Snap made a {{discovery}} that almost took his breath from him. On the <b>tree</b> trunk <b>rested</b> a big wildcat, it's eyes gleaming fiercely at the {{youth in the}} water! ...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{a priest}} {{and a group of}} men {{harvesting}} a rubber tree in Uganda. The priest is {{on the left side of}} the <b>tree</b> <b>resting</b> his left hand on the tree. There is a bucket on the ground by the base of the tree and next to the priests feet. A man is kneeling on the ground emptying a canister into a bucket. A man is standing behind him cutting the bark off the tree. Two men are standing behind the man cutting the bark. These four men are on the right side of the tree...|$|R

60|$|Still {{thinking}} of the recent conversation which he had had with the guide, Mark Breezy retired a little {{from the rest of}} the party and flung himself on the ground under a <b>tree</b> to <b>rest</b> and meditate.|$|R
50|$|The {{spotted linsang}} is nocturnal and solitary. It uses hollows in <b>trees</b> as <b>resting</b> and denning sites. It hunts {{on the ground}} and in trees and feeds on rodents, frogs and snakes. It was also {{observed}} feeding on carcass.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of an {{exterior}} {{view of a}} one-story house, [s. d. ]. The squared-shaped {{house can}} be seen in the center, showing its entrance immediately next to a wide set of windows and a low roof. A few <b>trees</b> <b>rest</b> next to the house and additional houses are noticeable in the background. A grassy lawn covers the foreground area.; An inserted paper label reads: " 4. 1 house type, a two bed room house with large living room, dining area and kitchen. This compact plan leaves little to be desired in room arrangement. If there is future need of a third bed room, it may be readily added by expanding the hall through openings already provided for. ...|$|R
60|$|As the pony, however, at {{once took}} a long and hearty draught it also condescended to drink, while Tolly {{followed}} suit. Afterwards he left the animals to graze, and sat down under a neighbouring <b>tree</b> to <b>rest</b> and swallow his last morsel of food.|$|R
50|$|The parish {{itself is}} {{triangular}} in shape. The coastline {{of the parish}} is 4.06 mi in length, with black sandy beaches, such as Pump Bay and Belle Tête dominating the southern coast, with sheer cliffs to the north. The lower slopes of the parish are dominated by abandoned sugarcane fields, as well as numerous small holdings, cultivating provision crops and tropical fruits. The town of Sandy Point, the second largest town on the island, skirts the southern coast, whilst the village Fig <b>Tree</b> <b>rests</b> just North of it. Moving inwards (East), the terrain shifts from the gently sloping coastal plain to the steep mountains of the North West Range, which, above 1000 feet, above sea level, is draped in tropical forests.|$|R
60|$|For a {{while she}} walked, not knowing whither she went, then by and bye she grew tired, and sat under a <b>tree</b> to <b>rest</b> and to hush her baby to sleep. Suddenly she raised her eyes, and saw a snake wriggling from under the bushes towards her.|$|R
5000|$|Radical-radical {{compounds}} {{in which each}} element of the character (called radical) hints at the meaning. For example, 休 [...] "rest" [...] is composed of the characters for [...] "person" [...] (人) and [...] "tree" [...] (木), with the intended idea of someone leaning against a <b>tree,</b> i.e. <b>resting.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Say that I forgive your mother, Ovid--and that I only ask {{one thing}} in return. I ask her to leave me to you, when the end has come. My dear, {{there is a feeling}} in me that I can't get over. Don't let me be buried in a great place all crowded with the dead! I once saw a picture--it was at home in Italy, I think--an English picture of a quiet little churchyard in the country. The shadows of the <b>trees</b> <b>rested</b> on the lonely graves. And some great poet had written--oh, such {{beautiful}} words about it. The red-breast loves to build and warble there, And little footsteps lightly print the ground. Promise, Ovid, you will take me to some place, far from crowds and noise--where children may gather the flowers on my grave." ...|$|R
5000|$|Much of {{the wood}} {{harvested}} in North America goes into lumber and other non-paper products. In the U.S., 36% of the annual timber harvest is used for paper and paperboard [...] and in Canada 21% comes directly from harvested <b>trees.</b> The <b>rest</b> comes from sawmill residues (55%) and recycled paper (24%).|$|R
60|$|Night {{came and}} he settled himself in an ample <b>tree</b> to <b>rest</b> until morning; but sleep would not come. Instead came {{the vision of}} a white girl being beaten by black women, and again of the same girl {{at the mercy of the}} warriors somewhere in that dark and forbidding jungle.|$|R
60|$|It {{was rather}} {{pleasant}} in the <b>tree,</b> and they <b>rested</b> {{near the top}} for some time. Then, of a sudden, Whopper started up.|$|R
500|$|On 4 June 1937, a British Klemm Swallow made a pilot-less {{take-off}} from Lympne {{and flew}} for some 35 minutes before crashing into a <b>tree.</b> Its <b>resting</b> place was [...] from RAF Hawkinge. On 31 July the Folkestone Trophy was competition was held and was won by Alex Henshaw in a Percival Mew Gull.|$|R
30|$|From SPRIES, all {{possible}} n[*]−[*] 1 edge combinations are generated by taking exactly one edge from each row and one edge {{from the first}} column while discarding combinations which are not distinct.

60|$|Night {{had settled}} over Treasure Isle {{by the time}} the shore was reached with the treasure, which was carried in one of the chests and in several bundles and {{numerous}} pockets. Men and boys were thoroughly fagged out, and they sat down under the <b>trees</b> to <b>rest</b> before starting to place their find underground again.|$|R
60|$|He {{shot the}} boat into a cleft, {{and caught the}} {{branches}} of an overhanging <b>tree.</b> The skiff <b>rested,</b> balancing with mutinous vibration, like a living thing.|$|R
50|$|As {{the cops}} stop {{searching for the}} night, she huddles up {{underneath}} a <b>tree</b> to <b>rest.</b> Eventually, a combination of fear, hunger, and thirst causes Trisha to hallucinate. She imagines several people from her life, {{as well as her}} hero, Tom Gordon, appearing to her. It is left unclear whether increasingly obvious signs of supernatural events in the woods are also hallucinations.|$|R
60|$|But Reddy Fox {{was nowhere}} to be seen, so Johnny Chuck trotted down the Lone Little Path to the wood. Mr. Sun was shining as brightly as ever he could and Johnny Chuck, who was very, very fat, grew very, very warm. By and by {{he sat down on the}} end of a log under a big <b>tree</b> to <b>rest.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{subpopulation}} in Kimboza Forest Reserve {{was estimated}} at 150,000 adults in 2009. The size of the remaining subpopulations is unknown, but their size is not thought contribute significantly to the total population. The two known sites outside protected areas are tiny: one consists of 14 Pandanus <b>trees</b> (the <b>rest</b> has been cleared for banana plantations) {{and the other is}} equally close to disappearing.|$|R
60|$|With a rapid spring Tom leaped {{beyond his}} friend, {{and with a}} blow, {{delivered}} with all his strength, severed {{the portion of the}} tail coiled round the <b>tree</b> from the <b>rest</b> of the body.|$|R
50|$|Terangi {{turns back}} to warn his people after he sees birds fleeing the island, an unprecedented, ominous event that Marama had dreamed about many years before. A once-in-a-lifetime {{hurricane}} strikes the island. A few, among them Dr. Kersaint and his pregnant patient, weather the disaster in a canoe, while Terangi ties his family and Madame De Laage to a stout <b>tree.</b> The <b>rest</b> drown, and the island is stripped bare.|$|R
60|$|At {{that moment}} a shout was {{heard in the}} woods, and Redfeather darting out, rushed over the ledge of rock on which {{one end of the}} <b>tree</b> <b>rested,</b> seized the trunk in his arms, and exerting all his strength, hurled it over into the river. In doing so he stumbled, and ere he could recover himself a branch caught him under the arm as the tree fell over, and dragged him into the boiling stream. This {{accident}} was probably the means of saving his life, for just as he fell the loud report of a gun rang through the woods, and a bullet passed through his cap. For a second or two both man and tree were lost in the foam, while the canoe dashed past in safety. The next instant Wabisca passed the narrows in her small craft, and steered for the tree. Redfeather, who had risen and sunk several times, saw her as she passed, and making a violent effort, he caught hold of the gunwale, and was carried down in safety.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Queen Elizabeth National Park {{is home to}} {{the tree}} {{climbing}} lions. Lions do not normally climb trees, except when chased by another lion group or wild buffalo. However the tree climbing lions found in QE-NP intentionally climb <b>trees</b> and <b>rest</b> on them in the afternoon, when the sun is high. This is a truly unique phenomenon. There have only been rare similar sightings of this in Lake Manyara National Park of Tanzania.|$|R
60|$|She rambled {{along by}} the brook, where the sand felt so nice and soft to her bare feet; she wandered through the woods, where she found {{blackberries}} and wild strawberries, and beautiful ferns; and she wandered on and on, among the rocks and the trees, and over the grass and the flowers, until she sat down by a great <b>tree</b> to <b>rest.</b> Then, without intending anything of the kind, she went fast asleep.|$|R
60|$|By noon they {{calculated}} {{that they had}} covered ten miles of the worst portion of {{the distance to the}} fort. The ride had been a strain to Joe, and when old Benson called a halt he was glad enough to slip to the ground and throw himself {{in the shade of a}} <b>tree</b> to <b>rest.</b> Darry and the old scout lit a fire, and soon had a nice steak preparing for dinner.|$|R
