50|$|A {{dye-sublimation printer}} (or dye-sub printer) is a printer which <b>employs</b> a <b>printing</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> uses heat to {{transfer}} dye to a medium {{such as a}} plastic card, paper or canvas. The process is usually to lay one colour at a time using a ribbon that has colour panels. Dye-sub printers are intended primarily for high-quality colour applications, including colour photography; and are less well-suited for text. While once the province of high-end print shops, dye-sublimation printers are now increasingly used as dedicated consumer photo printers.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{recent work}} to make high quality quartz gauge (temporal and spatial) shock wave measurements in a pulsed ion beam environment. Intense ion beam radiation, nominally 1 MeV protons, was deposited into material samples instrumented with shunted quartz gauges adjacent to the ion deposition zone. Fluence levels were chosen to excite three fundamentally different material response modes (1) strong vapor, (2) combined vapor and melt phase and (3) thermoelastic material response. A unique quartz gauge design was utilized <b>that</b> <b>employed</b> <b>printed</b> circuit board (PCB) technology to facilitate electrical shielding, ruggedness, and fabrication @e meeting the essential one dimensional requirements of the characterized Sandia shunted quartz gauge. Shock loading and unloading experiments were conducted to evaluate the piezoelectric response of the coupled quartz gauge/PCB transducer. High fidelity shock wave profiles were recorded at the three ion fluence levels providing dynamic material response data for vapor, melt and solid material phases...|$|R
2500|$|A {{dye-sublimation printer}} (or dye-sub printer) is a {{computer}} printer which <b>employs</b> a <b>printing</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> uses heat to transfer dye to a medium such as a plastic card, printer paper or poster paper. [...] The process is usually to lay one color at a time using a ribbon that has color panels. Most dye-sublimation printers use CMYO colors which differs from the more recognised CMYK colors in that the black dye is eliminated in favour of a clear overcoating. This overcoating (which has numerous names depending on the manufacturer) is effectively a thin laminate which protects the print from discoloration from UV light and the air while also rendering the print water-resistant. Many consumer and professional dye-sublimation printers are designed and used for producing photographic prints.|$|R
5000|$|Laser {{printing}} is an electrostatic digital <b>printing</b> <b>process.</b> It produces high-quality {{text and}} graphics (and moderate-quality photographs) by repeatedly passing {{a laser beam}} {{back and forth over}} a negatively charged cylinder called a [...] "drum" [...] to define a differentially charged image. The drum then selectively collects electrically charged powdered ink (toner), and transfers the image to paper, which is then heated in order to permanently fuse the text and/or imagery. As with digital photocopiers, laser printers <b>employ</b> a xerographic <b>printing</b> <b>process.</b> However, laser <b>printing</b> differs from analog photocopiers in that the image is produced by the direct scanning of the medium across the printer's photoreceptor. This enables laser printing to copy images more quickly than most photocopiers.|$|R
40|$|Printing {{of sensors}} and {{electronics}} has received substantial interest {{in recent years}} as the alternative approach to realize low-cost, large-area electronic, optoelectronic and sensing systems. <b>Printed</b> electronics <b>employs</b> conventional <b>printing</b> <b>processes</b> with plastics, papers or textiles as substrates. The adoption of any new technology is significantly higher when the high quality sensor systems are of low-cost. Printed sensors and electronics have clear advantages in terms of production cost and may offer one solution to meet the demand at low cost. For example, the capital expenditure is low; material utilization is high (or material waste is low); the possibility of industrial scale-up is built into the fabrication process. The cost of printed sensors will be 1 / 10 th to 1 / 100 th the cost of the sensor systems made with conventional electronics. With the predicable coming of “Trillion sensors society,” the low-cost manufacturing becomes ever so important. Other factors favoring the use of printing techniques include possibility to tailor the use of different solvent media and hence environmental friendliness. For this reason a significant tool chest of printed sensors and electronics has been built worldwide...|$|R

The paper contributes towards the already existing production within the field of the History of Education <b>that</b> <b>employs</b> pedagogical <b>printed</b> texts as privileged sources which answer the following questions: What, in historiographical terms, may be done with a source?

What is the relevance that such a procedure provides for historiographical activity, especially in activities with the specialized press focused on education and teaching? Responses give rise to discussion on the methodology of historiographical activities on Education. Their dissemination is sharing results, originating from the challenge in accepting the evidence, through one´s production, results from the historiographical activity conducted on the Revista do Ensino, published in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil.

40|$|We present {{concepts}} for self-assembly of diffractive optics {{with potential}} uses in biosensors and biocomputers. The simplest such optics, diffraction gratings, can potentially {{be made from}} chemically-stabilized microtubules migrating on nanopatterned tracks of the motor protein kinesin. We discuss the fabrication challenges involved in patterning sub-micron-scale structures with proteins that must be maintained in aqueous buffers to preserve their activity. A novel strategy is presented <b>that</b> <b>employs</b> dry contact <b>printing</b> onto glass-supported amino-silane monolayers of heterobifunctional crosslinkers, followed by solid-state reactions of these cross-linkers, to graft patterns of reactive groups onto the surface. Successive solution-phase addition of cysteine-mutant proteins and amine-reactive polyethylene glycol allows assembly of features onto the printed patterns. We present data from initial experiments showing successful micro- and nanopatterning of lines of single-cysteine mutants of kinesin interleaved with lines of polyethylene, indicating that this strategy can be employed to arrays of features with resolutions suitable for gratings...|$|R

40|$|Bioprinting is an {{emerging}} technique for the fabrication of living tissues that allows cells to be arranged in predetermined three-dimensional (3 D) architectures. However, to date, there are limited examples of bioprinted constructs containing multiple cell types patterned at high-resolution. Here {{we present a}} low-cost <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>employs</b> 3 D <b>printing</b> of aqueous droplets containing mammalian cells to produce robust, patterned constructs in oil, which were reproducibly transferred to culture medium. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells and ovine mesenchymal stem cells (oMSCs) were printed at tissue-relevant densities (10 (7) cells mL(- 1)) and a high droplet resolution of 1 nL. High-resolution 3 D geometries were printed with features of ≤ 200 [*]μm; these included an arborised cell junction, a diagonal-plane junction and an osteochondral interface. The printed cells showed high viability (90 % on average) and HEK cells within the printed structures were shown to proliferate under culture conditions. Significantly, a five-week tissue engineering study demonstrated that printed oMSCs could be differentiated down the chondrogenic lineage to generate cartilage-like structures containing type II collagen...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we show a low-cost, speed, microarray-based drug {{screening}} platform <b>that</b> <b>employs</b> inkjet <b>printing</b> drug dispensing on an enzymatic-rich surface. Mixtures {{of a model}} substrate (Dglucose) / inhibitor (D-glucal) {{couple have}} been inkjet printed on a target enzymatic monolayer (glucose oxidase) linked to a functionalized silicon oxide solid surface [1]. It has been possible to fabricate microarrays with quality factors as high as those of conventional pin printing spotting. By a simple horseradish-based colorimetric enzymatic assay, the detection of biological activity at the single spot has been proved. The figure shows a scheme of the platform: molecular inks of the enzymatic substrate or a substrate/inhibitor mixture are dispensed on the enzymatic-rich surface with detection at the single spots. Optical intensity measurements showed a competitive inhibition mechanism at the solid-liquid interface, along with overcompeting effects at lower inhibitor concentrations [2]. This methodology is extended to CYP 450 enzymes like CYP 3 A 4, {{one of the main}} targets for the phase I drug metabolism. In this respect, sol-gel enzymatic encapsulation strategies inside a polymer matrix prepared by MTMOS (methyltrimethoxysilane) precursors [3] or alginate are envisioned. The evaluation of the biological activity is realized via a fluorescent-based assay. In conclusion, we show how inkjet printing methodologies may investigate interesting physicochemical activities of functional biomolecules at a solid surfaces including their interaction and reaction behavior. Moreover, if coupled with a simple and generalized detection method they may satisfy speed, low-cost, miniaturized and high-throughput screening needs by dispensing entire chemical libraries on solid supported biological targets...|$|R
