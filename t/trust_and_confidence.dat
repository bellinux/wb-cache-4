5|$|He {{also said}} that the {{situation}} had been looked at in the wrong way by police, members of parliament and the security services; rather than asking if Profumo had committed adultery they should have asked if his conduct had led ordinary people to believe he committed adultery. His analogy was with divorce law; a man does not need to have committed adultery for his wife to have grounds to divorce him, but rather she simply has to believe that he has committed adultery. This is because such a belief would destroy the <b>trust</b> <b>and</b> <b>confidence</b> within the relationship. This brought criticism from several government ministers including Sir John Hobson, the Attorney-General for England and Wales, saying that it would mean condemning a man on the basis of suspicion rather than evidence.|$|E
5|$|Houphouët-Boigny {{adopted a}} system of {{economic}} liberalism in Côte d'Ivoire {{in order to obtain}} the <b>trust</b> <b>and</b> <b>confidence</b> of foreign investors, most notably the French. The advantages granted by the investment laws he established in 1959 allowed foreign business to repatriate up to 90% of their profits in their country of origin (the remaining 10% was reinvested in Côte d'Ivoire). He also developed an agenda for modernising the country's infrastructure, for example, building an American-style business district in Abidjan where five-star hotels and resorts welcomed tourists and businessmen. Côte d'Ivoire experienced economic growth of 11–12% from 1960 to 1965. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) grew twelvefold between 1960 and 1978, from 145 to 1,750billion CFA francs, while the trade balance continued to record a surplus.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the relations among three crucial variables within the literature o social capital. It discusses the conceptualization of each of them {{and how to make}} them operational, and analyzes their mutual interactions and the role of other classical variables, such as voluntary associations, in their origins. The survey data come from the Citizenship, Involvement, and Democracy project, undertaken in 12 European countries between 1999 and 2002. The empirical findings run in the opposite direction to the patterns established in most of the literature regarding the relationships between social <b>trust</b> <b>and</b> political <b>confidence,</b> between social <b>trust</b> <b>and</b> satisfaction with democracy, and the arguments supporting the idea that voluntary associations create both social <b>trust</b> <b>and</b> political <b>confidence.</b> The implications of these findings are both methodological and substantive...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{assesses the}} {{relationships}} between networks, performance and ethical behavior and reasoning. Using Kohlberg's framework moral development and supported by results of five semi-structured interviews with US managers, there is a close relationship between networks and performance. As the level of <b>trusts</b> <b>and</b> <b>confidence</b> increases, the players within a network tend to be flexible in following the rule-based six stages of moral behavior and reasoning. Flexibility intends to secure for continuing relationships within the networks and performance, the players need to observe the societal norms and regulations. Results of this research have implications to the managers when designing work place ethical guides, conducting business deals and dealing with ethical dilemmas...|$|R
40|$|The Four Cities Program has {{completed}} {{the first year}} of the planned two-year program. At the beginning of the first year, a variety of program initiation activities were accomplished. Contracts were negotiated; science and technology advisors were interviewed, selected and assigned; general indoctrination and integration of the advisors into city affairs occurred; technical needs were identified and related projects pursued; pilot projects for the second year were identified; inter-city coordination on technical problems began to emerge; and the general soundness of the four cities program seems to have been established. Above all, the inter-personal relationships between the advisors and their interfaces in city government appear to be functioning smoothly. The establishment of such mutual respect, <b>trusts,</b> <b>and</b> <b>confidences</b> are believed essential to the success of the program...|$|R

25|$|The primary {{implied term}} of an {{employment}} contract {{that may be}} broken is mutual <b>trust</b> <b>and</b> <b>confidence.</b> In Johnson v Unisys Ltd the House of Lords held by 4 to 1 that damages for breach of mutual <b>trust</b> <b>and</b> <b>confidence</b> {{at the point of}} dismissal should not exceed the statutory limit on unfair dismissal claims, because otherwise the statutory limits would be undermined. This limit was £74,200 in 2013, though the median award was merely £4,560. This meant a computer worker who developed a psychiatric illness following a wrongful dismissal procedure could not claim his total economic losses, which would have amounted to £400,000 in damages. However, if the breach occurs while the employment relationship subsists, that limit is inapplicable. So in Eastwood v Magnox Electric plc, a school teacher who also suffered psychiatric injury, but as a result of harassment and victimisation while he still worked, could claim for a full measure of damages for the breach of mutual <b>trust</b> <b>and</b> <b>confidence.</b> In any event the limit is merely implied and depends on construction of the contract, so that it may be opted out of by express words providing for a higher sum, for example, by expressly providing for a disciplinary procedure. A notable absence of an implied term at common law historically (i.e. before the development of mutual <b>trust</b> <b>and</b> <b>confidence)</b> was that an employer would have to give any good reasons for a dismissal. This was recommended to be changed in the Donovan Report 1968, and it launched the present system of unfair dismissal.|$|E

25|$|The {{trial was}} {{heard in the}} Federal Court of Australia. Besanko J held {{that there was an}} implied term of mutual <b>trust</b> <b>and</b> <b>confidence</b> in the {{contract}} which operated only where a party did not have reasonable and proper cause for his conduct and the conduct was likely to destroy or seriously damage the relationship of <b>trust</b> <b>and</b> <b>confidence,</b> applying the decision in Malik v Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA. The Bank had committed a serious breach of its policies and that was a breach of the implied term. The Court dismissed Mr Barker's claims that the policies were incorporated into his contract and that the Bank had engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct. The court awarded damages assessed at $317,500, based upon discounted past and future economic loss.|$|E
25|$|Undue {{influence}} is an equitable doctrine that involves one person {{taking advantage of}} a position of power over another person through a special relationship such as between parent and child or solicitor and client.

25|$|In Australia the {{employment}} relationship involves {{a degree of}} <b>trust</b> <b>and</b> <b>confidence,</b> particularly for a corporate employer that can only act through its employees. An employer may summarily dismiss an employee who destroys that <b>trust</b> <b>and</b> <b>confidence.</b> An employer may seek to entice or motivate its employees in the expectation of receiving a bonus payment or promises of fair treatment. Statute, regulation and industrial awards may provide the “means by which employees may be protected from abuses of power by the employer, and provides means of redress to employees who are aggrieved by some conduct of the employer” In some instances however the availability of redress may be less certain, for example a bonus payment made {{be left to the}} discretion of the employer, or the promises of fair treatment may be contained solely in policies of the employer. The employee trusts that the employer will deliver on that expectation or promise. The question arising in Mr Barker's case was whether the expectation or promise in the Bank's policies were legally enforceable.|$|E

In this paper, we explore the cognitive science background which captures the notions of <b>trust,</b> reputation <b>and</b> <b>confidence</b> to provide a computational trust mechanism applied to negotiations within artificial societies.
