5|$|The {{battle is}} often {{described}} as the first major battle of the war in the Pacific in which Allied troops decisively defeated Japanese land forces. Although Japanese land forces had experienced local setbacks elsewhere in the Pacific earlier in the war, unlike at Milne Bay, these actions had not forced them to withdraw completely and abandon their strategic objective. Nor did <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> a profound impact upon the moral aspect of the war. Milne Bay showed the limits of Japanese capability to expand using relatively small forces in the face of increasingly larger Allied troop concentrations and command of the air. As a result of the battle, Allied morale was boosted and Milne Bay was developed into a major Allied base, which was used to mount subsequent operations in the region.|$|E

Most people in this {{situation}} will be wearing or carrying an item of jewelry with some connection to the person they have lost, but if asked directly {{in the context of}} a psychic reading whether <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> an item, the client may be shocked and assume that the reader learned the information directly from the deceased loved one. Robert Todd Carroll notes in The Skeptic's Dictionary that some would consider this to be cold reading.|$|E

500|$|Two tribe members {{dressed as}} {{tourists}} {{come down the}} aisle to ask the tribe why <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> long hair. [...] In answer, Claude and Berger lead the tribe in explaining the significance of their [...] "Hair". [...] The tourist lady states that kids should [...] "be free, no guilt" [...] and should [...] "do whatever you want, just {{so long as you}} don't hurt anyone." [...] She observes that long hair is natural, like the [...] "elegant plumage" [...] of male birds ("My Conviction"). [...] She opens her coat to reveal that she's a man in drag. [...] As the couple leaves, the tribe calls her Margaret Mead.|$|E
500|$|Eliminativism {{maintains}} that the common-sense understanding of the mind is mistaken, and that the neurosciences will one day reveal that the mental states that are talked about in everyday discourse, using words such as [...] "intend", [...] "believe", [...] "desire", and [...] "love", do not refer to anything real. Because of the inadequacy of natural languages, people mistakenly think that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> beliefs and desires. Some eliminativists, such as Frank Jackson, claim that consciousness does not exist except as an epiphenomenon of brain function; others, such as Georges Rey, claim that the concept will eventually be eliminated as neuroscience progresses. Consciousness and folk psychology are separate issues {{and it is possible}} to take an eliminative stance on one but not the other. The roots of eliminativism go back to the writings of Wilfred Sellars, W.V. Quine, Paul Feyerabend, and Richard Rorty. The term [...] "eliminative materialism" [...] was first introduced by James Cornman in 1968 while describing a version of physicalism endorsed by Rorty. The later Ludwig Wittgenstein was also an important inspiration for eliminativism, particularly with his attack on [...] "private objects" [...] as [...] "grammatical fictions".|$|E
500|$|Recurring {{cast members}} who appear in [...] "Acafellas" [...] are Stephen Tobolowsky as former glee club {{director}} Sandy Ryerson, Patrick Gallagher as football coach Ken Tanaka, Iqbal Theba as Principal Figgins, Kent Avenido as Sheets and Things employee Howard Bamboo, and Naya Rivera and Heather Morris as glee club members Santana Lopez and Brittany Pierce. Whit Hertford guest-starred as choreographer Dakota Stanley. Cheyenne Jackson was originally {{supposed to play}} Dakota Stanley, but {{when he arrived in}} California he learned that he had the flu. John Lloyd Young played Henri, [...] "a retired wood shop teacher with an excellent singing voice", and Victor Garber and Debra Monk played Will's parents. Morrison was [...] "thrilled" [...] by Garber's casting, having been a longstanding fan of his. Josh Groban received special guest star billing, playing, in Colfer's words, [...] "himself as this ignorant asshole". Morrison's rapping in the episode was an already acquired skill, with Gilsig commenting: [...] "He can do it. It didn't look like a joke, it actually looked totally authentic, and he was fantastic. I think he has just an amazing musical range. People like that who have been singing their whole lives, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> a command of that." [...] Riley deemed Kurt's coming out in the episode [...] "very emotional" [...] and [...] "one of [...] favorite scenes". Colfer described the scene as [...] "very respectful and very touching ... very, very real and serious." ...|$|E

500|$|While away seeing Juno Delia {{discovers the}} {{handbook}} and reads it. Although Adam and Barbara remain invisible to Charles and Delia, Lydia {{can see the}} ghost couple and befriends them. Against Juno's advice, the Maitlands contact the miscreant Betelgeuse, Juno's former assistant and now freelance [...] "bio-exorcist" [...] ghost, to scare away the Deetzes. At first, they are unaware that [...] "Betelgeuse" [...] is pronounced [...] "Beetlejuice", which is why <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> difficulty pronouncing his name and thereby summoning him. However, Betelgeuse quickly offends the Maitlands with his crude and morbid demeanor; and they reconsider hiring him, though too late {{to stop him from}} wreaking havoc on the Deetzes. The small town's charm and the supernatural events inspire Charles to pitch his boss Maxie Dean on transforming the town into a tourist hot spot, but Maxie wants proof of the ghosts. Using the Handbook for the Recently Deceased, Otho conducts what he thinks is a séance and summons Adam and Barbara, but they begin to decay and die, as Otho had unwittingly performed an exorcism instead. Horrified, Lydia begrudgingly summons Betelgeuse for help; but he agrees to help her only on the condition that she marry him, enabling him to freely cause chaos in the mortal world. Betelgeuse saves the Maitlands and disposes of Maxie, his wife, and Otho, then prepares a wedding before a ghastly minister. The Maitlands intervene before the ceremony is completed, with Barbara riding a sandworm through the house to devour Betelgeuse.|$|E
500|$|Sean Kinney {{said about}} the new album and the fans' mixed {{reactions}} about the band moving on after Staley's death: [...] "Look, it’s a big move to fucking stand up and move on. Some people, the music connected with them so strongly, their opinions, {{how they feel about}} it... It’s amazing that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> a connection but they seem to act like it happened to them. This happened to us and Layne’s family, not them. This is actually our lives. If we’re okay with it, why can’t you be? This happened to us, this didn’t happen to you. But this album isn’t about that, it’s a bigger universal point. We’re all going to fucking die, we’re all going to lose somebody, and it fucking hurts. How do you move on? This record is us moving on, and hurting. That, to me, is a victory. I already feel like I’ve won." [...] "Sometimes people ask us, ‘Wouldn’t Layne have been pissed off that we did this?’ And I tell them {{it would have been the}} opposite: he would have been pissed off that it took us so long to do this. We’re not doing this for money; there is no money in the music business anymore. Jerry and I funded the whole album, and we spent lots of our own money, because we believe in this. And one of the reasons I’m doing this is so more light is turned on to something where the light was turned off." [...] And Cantrell added: [...] "We’ve toured around the world, we’ve lost some friends, we buried a dear friend, and somebody that you just can’t fucking replace, and then we’ve chosen by circumstance to get together again. That turned into ‘maybe we can fucking do this.’ And that turned into this".|$|E

2500|$|A {{study of}} coffee growers in Guatemala {{illustrates}} {{the effect of}} fair trade practices on growers. In this study, thirty-four farmers were interviewed. Of those thirty-four growers, twenty-two had an understanding of fair trade based on internationally recognized definitions, for example, describing fair trade in market and economical terms or knowing what the social premium is and how their cooperative has used it. Three growers explained a deep understanding of fair trade, showing a knowledge of both fair market principles and how fair trade affects them socially. Nine growers had erroneous or no knowledge of Fair Trade. The three growers who had a deeper knowledge of the social implications of fair trade all have responsibilities within their cooperatives. One is a manager, one {{is in charge of}} the wet mill, and one is his group's treasurer. These farmers did not have a pattern in terms of years of education, age, or years of membership in the cooperative; their answers to the questions, [...] "Why did you join?" [...] differentiate them from other members and explain why <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> an extensive knowledge of fair trade. These farmers cited switching to organic farming, wanting to raise money for social projects, and more training offered as reasons for joining the cooperative, other than receiving a better price for their coffee.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{comprehensive}} {{examination of the}} KLF's announcement and its context, Select called it [...] "the last grand gesture, the most heroic act of public self destruction {{in the history of}} pop. And it's also Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty's final extravagant howl of self disgust, defiance and contempt for a music world gone foul and corrupt." [...] Many of the KLF's friends and collaborators gave their reactions in the magazine. Movie director Bill Butt said that [...] "Like everything, they're dealing with it in a very realistic way, a fresh, unbitter way, which is very often not the case. A lot of bands disappear with such a terrible loss of dignity". Scott Piering said that [...] "They've got a huge buzz off this, that's for sure, because it's something that's finally thrilling. It's scary to have thrown away a fortune which I know they have. Just the idea of starting over is exciting. Starting over on what? Well, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> great ideas, like buying submarines". Even Kenny Gates, who as a director of the KLF's distributors APT stood to lose financially from the move, called it [...] "Conceptually and philosophically... absolutely brilliant". Mark Stent reported the doubts of many when he said that [...] "I [...] had so many people who I know, heads of record companies, A men saying, 'Come on, It's a big scam.' But I firmly believe it's over". [...] "For the very last spectacularly insane time", the magazine concluded, [...] "The KLF have done what was least expected of them".|$|E
2500|$|Charlotte de Sauve {{has been}} {{credited}} {{as a source}} of the information that led to the execution of Marguerite de Valois's lover Joseph Boniface de La Môle and Annibal de Coconnas for engaging in a conspiracy to overthrow the gravely ill Charles IX and the Queen Mother in 1574 with the assistance of Huguenot troops. In 1575, Catherine de' Medici, abetted by her son Henry III, instructed Charlotte to seduce the king's brother, her youngest son, François, Duke of Alençon, with the aim of provoking hostility between the two young men, so that they would not conspire together in the future. Charlotte subsequently became the duke's mistress, creating a rift between the former close friends, as Navarre and Alençon became rivals over Charlotte. According to Marguerite's memoirs: [...] "Charlotte de Sauve treated both of them [...] {{in such a way that}} they became extremely jealous of each other, to such a point that they forgot their ambitions, their duties and their plans and thought of nothing but chasing after this woman". Henry of Navarre wrote to a friend: [...] "The court is the strangest I have ever known. We are nearly always ready to cut each other's throat ... All the band you know wants my death on account of my love for Monsieur [...] and they have forbidden for the third time my mistress [...] to speak to me. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> a hold on her that she does not dare look at me. I am waiting for a minor battle, for they say they will kill me, and I want to be one jump ahead of them". On one occasion, Henry III had Alençon's papers searched for evidence of political plotting but turned up only a declaration of love from Madame de Sauve.|$|E
