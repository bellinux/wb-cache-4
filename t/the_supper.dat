5|$|In the Reformed confessions, the Lord's Supper is a {{meal that}} {{provides}} spiritual nourishment. Eating {{the body and}} drinking the blood of Christ in the sacrament is believed to spiritually strengthen Christians. Believers are already believed to be united with Christ, but <b>the</b> <b>Supper</b> serves to deepen and strengthen this union. <b>The</b> <b>Supper</b> is also a way to commemorate and proclaim the death and resurrection of Christ. Partakers are to express gratitude and praise to God in thanks for his death and the benefits it provides. <b>The</b> <b>Supper</b> is believed to assure Christians of their salvation and union with Christ, which has been communicated {{to them in the}} preaching of the gospel. <b>The</b> <b>Supper</b> is also believed to enhance Christians' union with one another. It calls Christians to love and obey Christ, and to live in harmony with other Christians.|$|E
5|$|John Calvin, a very {{influential}} early Reformed theologian, believed the Lord's Supper fed Christians with the spiritual food of union with Christ. He believed that in <b>the</b> <b>Supper</b> Christians feed on Christ's flesh, which {{he saw as}} an inexplicable miracle. Calvin taught that <b>the</b> <b>Supper</b> confirms the promises communicated to Christians in the preaching of the gospel. He also saw its purpose as provoking praise for God and love for other people. He believed it necessary for Christians to partake of Christ's humanity in <b>the</b> <b>Supper</b> {{as well as his}} Spirit, and that the bread and wine really present, rather than simply symbolize or represent, Christ's body and blood. Calvin spoke of the communication involved in the Lord's Supper as spiritual, meaning that it originates in the Holy Spirit. Calvin's teaching on the Lord's Supper was followed by many others in the Reformed tradition, including Martin Bucer and Peter Martyr Vermigli. Calvin, like Zwingli and against Luther, did not believe that Christ is bodily present in the elements of the Eucharist. He taught that Christ remains in heaven and that we commune with him in the Lord's Supper by being raised up to him rather than him descending to us. Calvin believed the elements of <b>the</b> <b>Supper</b> to be used by God as instruments in communicating the promises which they represent, a view called symbolic instrumentalism.|$|E

5|$|The Reformed {{confessions of}} faith, {{official}} {{statements of the}} beliefs of Reformed churches, followed the view that Christ is really present in <b>the</b> <b>Supper.</b> They either took Calvin's view that the signs of bread and wine are instrumental in communicating grace, or Bullinger's symbolic parallelism. Some of the German-language Reformed confessions seem hesitant to make the sacrament a means of grace, but they all maintain {{that there is a}} union between the outward signs of the sacrament and the inward grace signified. Reformed orthodox theologians also continued to insist on Christ's real presence in <b>the</b> <b>Supper,</b> while denying against Lutherans that his body is locally present.|$|E
5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, the {{doctrine}} of the Lord's Supper became a point of controversy between American Reformed theologians John Williamson Nevin and Charles Hodge. Nevin, influenced by German Lutheran Isaak August Dorner, wrote that through the Lord's Supper, Christians are mystically united to Christ's whole person, and that this union is through Christ's flesh. Hodge thought that Nevin overemphasized the idea of mystical union, and argued that when Christians are said to commune with Christ in <b>the</b> <b>Supper,</b> it is Christ's virtue as a sacrifice for their sins which is meant rather than a mystical union with his flesh. Hodge also taught that nothing is communicated in the Lord's Supper which is not communicated in the preaching of God's word. American Presbyterians generally agreed with Hodge. Nineteenth-century Reformed Congregationalist followers of the New England theology generally held a symbolic, memorial view of <b>the</b> <b>Supper.</b>|$|E

40|$|Resuming {{the theme}} of the Holy Eucharist, which we {{initiated}} with the presentation of the icons Jesus Christ the Vine from the collection of the National Museum of the History of Moldova, we bring into discussion five other icons that remind us of an event of profound symbolic and spiritual significance – <b>the</b> Last <b>Supper.</b> <b>The</b> purpose of our research is, in particular, to determine the iconographic significance of the museum compositions, to identify in these images the evangelical topics related to <b>the</b> Last <b>Supper.</b> We also wanted highlight the variants of iconographic schemes established by specialists in this field, which can be recognized in the icons in question, establish the area of their origin and the time of their creation. In <b>the</b> Last <b>Supper</b> <b>the</b> spiritual principles of the Christian teaching are expressed, which are actual today. Inspired by the stories of the evangelical apostles, early Christian art will translate into images the major moments of <b>the</b> Last <b>Supper.</b> <b>The</b> topics of the washing the feet, the communion of the apostles, <b>the</b> Last <b>Supper,</b> <b>the</b> Eucharist, being programmed in the church iconography, will be reflected on different areas of the altar and the nave, depending on the functional and semantic aspects, strengthening the spiritual message of the Eucharist or the cycle of the Passion of the Lord. On the five museum’s icons devoted to the subject of <b>the</b> Last <b>Supper</b> similar scenes are presented at first sight. However, a careful study of their compositions reveals some differences regarding the representation of the background architecture, the way the apostles are placed, their poses, the representation of the decoration elements, the accessories, etc. In accordance with the above, {{it should be noted that}} these icons depict different episodes of <b>the</b> Last <b>Supper.</b> <b>The</b> Last <b>Supper</b> compositions from <b>the</b> collections of the National Museum of the History of Moldova, first published and deserving attention of specialists, will complete the list of Jesus Christ icons, kept in museum collections of the Republic. ...|$|R

5|$|Reformed confessions {{reject the}} Catholic {{doctrine}} that the Eucharist is a sacrifice of propitiation, or sacrifice to satisfy God's wrath and attain forgiveness of sins. Instead, they teach that Christ's body {{is only to}} be received, not re-presented to God as a sacrifice. The confessions do sometimes speak of <b>the</b> <b>Supper</b> as a sacrifice of thanksgiving for the gift of propitiation which has been received. In the twentieth century, Scottish Reformed theologian T. F. Torrance developed a strong doctrine of Eucharistic sacrifice. He argued that Christ's person and work could not be separated, and that the Eucharist mediated his sacrificial death.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the council}} had hesitated in abolishing the mass, the {{decrease}} {{in the exercise of}} traditional piety allowed pastors to be unofficially released from the requirement of celebrating mass. As individual pastors altered their practices as each saw fit, Zwingli was prompted to address this disorganised situation by designing a communion liturgy in the German language. This was published in Aktion oder Brauch des Nachtmahls (Act or Custom of <b>the</b> <b>Supper).</b> Shortly before Easter, Zwingli and his closest associates requested the council to cancel the mass and to introduce the new public order of worship. On Maundy Thursday, 13 April 1525, Zwingli celebrated communion under his new liturgy. Wooden cups and plates were used to avoid any outward displays of formality. The congregation sat at set tables to emphasise the meal aspect of the sacrament. The sermon was {{the focal point of the}} service and there was no organ music or singing. The importance of the sermon in the worship service was underlined by Zwingli's proposal to limit the celebration of communion to four times a year.|$|E

5|$|Nettlecombe Court {{has several}} emblems and carvings bearing {{the image of}} a horse rising from the sea, which are the Trevilian family arms, found {{throughout}} the house. The source story of the arms is the Lyonesse legend of Trevilian, as follows: Lyonesse were the lands, now submerged, on the west coast that was said to be the lands of Camelot of King Arthur and the site of the final mortal battle between King Arthur and Mordred. Tennyson's Idylls of the King claims Lyonesse as the final resting place of King Arthur himself. Perhaps this is why the grave of the king cannot be found, as it lies beneath the sea. Roman writings also speak of a Leonis, now submerged off the coast. Lyonesse was also the home of Tristan and Isolde. Legend relates that when Lyonesse suddenly sank, it was inundated as sea levels rushed in. The sole surviving knight of King Arthur's Lyonesse was said to be only one knight, Trevilian, who escaped by riding his white horse through the rising waters to higher ground before Lyonesse was submerged. Trevilian urged the other knights to join him in his attempt to escape, who counter-urged Trevilian to stay put and wait for the floodwaters to pass. The sedentary knights jovially bet wagers amongst themselves around <b>the</b> <b>supper</b> table, {{as to whether or not}} Trevilian and his white horse could survive swimming through the incoming flooding and make it to higher ground. None of the other Arthurian knights of Lyonesse, except Trevilian, was said to have survived the great sinking and inundation of Lyonesse. Submerged Medieval church bells of the lost land of Lyonesse were later said to be heard ringing, muffled under the water, when turbulent storms created rough seas. The surviving Trevilian became the founder of the current British Trevilian-Trevelyan family, whose coat of arms still bears a white horse issuing forth from the sea. In some cases the Trevilian white horse arms may be seen combined at Nettlecombe with other related family arms, indicating marriages to Raleigh, Luttrell, Wyndham, Chichester and Strode.|$|E
