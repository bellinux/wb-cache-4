5|$|The Restless Spirit is a 1913 American silent short drama film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Allan Dwan, featuring J. Warren Kerrigan and Pauline Bush. The film is based on Thomas Gray's 1751 poem, Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard, and {{tells the story of a}} man who wishes to be a conqueror. <b>The</b> <b>Dreamer</b> heads out into the desert and is nursed back to health by the Desert Flower. A series of illusions follows which shows the futility of conquest when he cannot conquer his own community. He returns and eventually becomes respected by the community that once ridiculed him. The film makes use of numerous dissolves which were technically difficult to execute, and reportedly sent the cameraman to the hospital due to stress. The film may have been the last unbilled appearance by Lon Chaney, and was released on October 27, 1913 by Universal Film Manufacturing Company under the Victor label. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

5|$|Each dream {{acts as a}} {{character}} study, exploring the fears and future of <b>the</b> <b>dreamer.</b> Willow, Xander, and Giles are stalked by a shadowy figure, then killed within their dreams. The way in which each is killed {{is directly related to}} the role they had assumed when melding with Buffy in the previous episodeâ€”that role is indicated by the Tarot-like card used to symbolize the character's essence. Willow's card had been Spiritus, representing her magical powers; she is killed by having her spirit sucked out of her. Xander's card had been Animus, representing his heart; he is killed by having his heart ripped out. Giles had been represented by the card Sophus, a symbol of his intellect and role as teacher; he is killed by being scalped. Buffy's card, Manus, was representative of her physical strength. In her dream the stalker is revealed as the primitive, first slayer, who confronts her aggressively. The two fight, but the First Slayer is defeated when Buffy realizes a key difference between them: the First Slayer was alone and isolated, while Buffy is unique among Slayers in that she has friends and a life beyond slaying, factors which make her the greatest Slayer ever.|$|E
25|$|Carl Jung {{rejected}} many of Freud's theories. Jung expanded on Freud's {{idea that}} dream content {{relates to the}} dreamer's unconscious desires. He described dreams as messages to <b>the</b> <b>dreamer</b> and argued that dreamers should pay attention for their own good. He {{came to believe that}} dreams present <b>the</b> <b>dreamer</b> with revelations that can uncover and help to resolve emotional or religious problems and fears.|$|E
25|$|Fritz Perls {{presented}} {{his theory of}} dreams {{as part of the}} holistic nature of Gestalt therapy. Dreams are seen as projections of parts of the self that have been ignored, rejected, or suppressed. Jung argued that one could consider every person in the dream to represent an aspect of <b>the</b> <b>dreamer,</b> which he called the subjective approach to dreams. Perls expanded this point of view to say that even inanimate objects in the dream may represent aspects of <b>the</b> <b>dreamer.</b> <b>The</b> <b>dreamer</b> may, therefore, be asked to imagine being an object in the dream and to describe it, in order to bring into awareness the characteristics of the object that correspond with the dreamer's personality.|$|E

50|$|Wine of <b>the</b> <b>Dreamers</b> is a 1951 {{science fiction}} novel by American writer John D. MacDonald.

Though he later also wrote the science fiction novels Ballroom of the Skies and The Girl, the Gold Watch & Everything, MacDonald was primarily a writer of mysteries.

5000|$|In the 1980 Rolling Stone History of Rock & Roll, writer Lester Bangs {{paid tribute}} (of a kind) to the group: Freddie and <b>the</b> <b>Dreamers</b> had no {{masterpiece}} but a [...] of talentless idiocy and enough persistence to get four albums and one film soundtrack released ... <b>the</b> <b>Dreamers</b> looked as thuggish as Freddie looked dippy ... Freddie and <b>the</b> <b>Dreamers</b> represented {{a triumph of}} rock as cretinous swill, and as such should be not only respected, but given their place in history.|$|R

25|$|The Ojibwe crafted the dreamcatcher. They {{believe that}} if one is hung above {{the head of a}} sleeper, it will catch and trap bad dreams, {{preventing}} them from reaching <b>the</b> <b>dreamer.</b> Traditional Ojibwe use dreamcatchers only for children, as they believe that adults should be able to interpret their dreams, good or bad, and use them in their lives.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Dreamers</b> joined Richard Berry in {{the studio}} and during 1955 and 1956 made several {{recordings}} for Flair and RPM Records.

5000|$|The closing {{ceremony}} {{opened with a}} filmed segment showing [...] "eccentric travellers" [...] from around the city making {{their way to the}} Olympic Stadium in steampunk-inspired vehicles prepared by the performance art group Mutoid Waste Company. At the end of the video, a group of Wind Gremlins drove into the stadium on custom-built motorbikes with huge fans on the front. The wind awakened <b>the</b> <b>Dreamers</b> from their sleep, and they struggled to fend off the Gremlins' attack while keeping the Agitos in place. In <b>the</b> end <b>the</b> <b>Dreamers</b> were unable to hold on, and the Agitos float away with one of <b>the</b> <b>Dreamers</b> still clinging on to them. At that point, performers carrying flares entered the field of play to the rescue of <b>the</b> <b>Dreamers.</b>|$|R
25|$|The first {{recorded}} {{mention of the}} idea was by Zhuangzi, {{and it is also}} discussed in Hinduism, which makes extensive use of the argument in its writings. It was formally introduced to Western philosophy by Descartes in the 17th century in his Meditations on First Philosophy. Stimulus, usually an auditory one, becomes a part of a dream, eventually then awakening <b>the</b> <b>dreamer.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dreams of {{absent-minded}} transgression (DAMT) are dreams wherein <b>the</b> <b>dreamer</b> absentmindedly performs {{an action}} {{that he or she}} has been trying to stop (one classic example is of a quitting smoker having dreams of lighting a cigarette). Subjects who have had DAMT have reported waking with intense feelings of guilt. One study found a positive association between having these dreams and successfully stopping the behavior.|$|E

25|$|Sigmund Freud, who {{developed}} the psychological discipline of psychoanalysis, wrote extensively about dream theories and their interpretations in the early 1900s. He explained dreams as manifestations of one's deepest desires and anxieties, often relating to repressed childhood memories or obsessions. Furthermore, he believed that virtually every dream topic, regardless of its content, represented the release of sexual tension. In The Interpretation of Dreams (1899), Freud developed a psychological technique to interpret dreams and devised a series of guidelines to understand the symbols and motifs that appear in our dreams. In modern times, dreams {{have been seen as}} a connection to the unconscious mind. They range from normal and ordinary to overly surreal and bizarre. Dreams can have varying natures, such as being frightening, exciting, magical, melancholic, adventurous, or sexual. The events in dreams are generally outside the control of <b>the</b> <b>dreamer,</b> with the exception of lucid dreaming, where <b>the</b> <b>dreamer</b> is self-aware. Dreams can at times make a creative thought occur to the person or give a sense of inspiration.|$|E
25|$|The visual {{nature of}} dreams is {{generally}} highly phantasmagoric; that is, different locations and objects continuously blend into each other. The visuals (including locations, characters/people, objects/artifacts) are generally reflective of a person's memories and experiences, but conversation {{can take on}} highly exaggerated and bizarre forms. Some dreams may even tell elaborate stories wherein <b>the</b> <b>dreamer</b> enters entirely new, complex worlds and awakes with ideas, thoughts and feelings never experienced prior to the dream.|$|E

25|$|During most dreams, {{the person}} dreaming is {{not aware that}} they are dreaming, no matter how absurd or {{eccentric}} the dream is. The reason for this {{may be that the}} prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain responsible for logic and planning, exhibits decreased activity during dreams. This allows <b>the</b> <b>dreamer</b> to more actively interact with the dream without thinking about what might happen, since things that would normally stand out in reality blend in with the dream scenery.|$|E
25|$|When asleep, {{a person}} is unable to make {{judgments}} as they do when they are awake Due to the senses not functioning normally during sleep, {{they are unable to}} help a person judge what is happening in their dream. This in turn leads the person to believe the dream is real. Dreams may be absurd in nature but the senses are not able to discern whether they are real or not. So, <b>the</b> <b>dreamer</b> is left to accept the dream because they lack the choice to judge it.|$|E
