40|$|A {{developed}} {{solution for}} fed-batch process modeling and model predictive control (MPC), facilitating {{good manufacturing practice}} (GMP) based on process elaboration, control, and validation, {{is presented in the}} paper. The step-by-step evolution of the so-called “golden batch” optimal biomass growth profile and its control during the process is demonstrated. The case study of an advanced fed-batch control was performed on the recombinant E. coli BL 21 lab-scale (5. 4 L) biomass production process using the conventional stirred <b>tank</b> <b>glass</b> reactor. Additionally, a test experiment for control reproducibility and applicability assessment of the proposed approach was carried out in a single-use stirred tank reactor (5. 7 L). Four sequentially performed experiments are demonstrated as an example for desirable feeding profile evolution for E. coli BL 21 biomass production in a glucose-limited fed-batch process. Under different initial biomass and glucose conditions, as well as for different reference feeding profiles selected in the explorative experiments, good tracking quality of preset reference trajectories by the MPC system has been demonstrated. Estimated and experimentally measured biomass mean deviations from the preset reference value {{at the end of the}} processes were 4. 6 and 3. 8 %, respectively. Biomass concentration of 93. 6 g L– 1 (at 24 h) was reached in the most productive run. Better process controllability and safer process run, in terms of avoiding culture overfeeding but still maintaining a sufficiently high growth rate, was suggested for the process with biomass yield of 79. 8 g L– 1 (at 24 h). Practical recommendations on the approach application and adaptation for fed-batch cultures of interest are provided...|$|E

To this end {{we begin with the}} design of a first metal structure which will be located at the glass tank 1 m eter in height at the top, and the reservoir of 40 cm in height at the bottom. The centrifugal pump will be on the reservoir, and the ultrasonic sensor, RF transmitter and 12 Vdc source on the glass tank.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an original experimental and numerical investigation of acoustic streaming {{driven by an}} acoustic beam reflecting on a wall. The water experiment features a 2 MHz acoustic beam totally reflecting {{on one of the}} <b>tank</b> <b>glass</b> walls. The velocity field in the plane containing the incident and reflected beam axes is investigated using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). It exhibits an original y-shaped structure: the impinging jet driven by the incident beam is continued by a wall jet, and a second jet is driven by the reflected beam, making an angle with the impinging jet. The flow is also numerically modeled as that of an incompressible fluid undergoing a volumetric acoustic force. This is a classical approach, but the complexity of the acoustic field in the reflection zone, however, makes it difficult to derive an exact force field in this area. Several approximations are thus tested; we show that the observed velocity field only weakly depends on the approximation used in this small region. The numerical model results are in good agreement with the experimental results. The spreading of the jets around their impingement points and the creeping of the wall jets along the walls are observed to allow the interaction of the flow with a large wall surface, which can even extend to the corners of the tank; this could be an interesting feature for applications requiring efficient heat and mass transfer at the wall. More fundamentally, the velocity field is shown to have both similarities and differences with the velocity field in a classical centered acoustic streaming jet. In particular its magnitude exhibits a fairly good agreement with a formerly derived scaling law based on the balance of the acoustic forcing with the inertia due to the flow acceleration along the beam axis...|$|E
