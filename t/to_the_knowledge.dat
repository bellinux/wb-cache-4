5|$|Carr also theorizes {{that the}} {{capacity}} to contemplate may diminish as computer algorithms unburden an Internet user's brain {{of much of the}} painstaking knowledge work — the manipulation of abstract information and knowledge — that was previously done manually. In comparing the Internet with Frederick Winslow Taylor's management system for industrial efficiency, Carr makes the point that back then some workers complained that they felt they were becoming mere automatons due to the systemic application of Taylorism — a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflow processes, improving labor productivity. Carr selects Google as a prime example of a company in which computer engineers and software designers have applied Taylorism <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> industry, delivering increasingly robust information that may have the effect of minimizing opportunities to ponder ambiguities. Additionally, he argues that the Internet's dominant business model is one that thrives as companies either collect information on users or deliver them advertisements, therefore companies capitalize on users who move from link to link rather than those who engage in sustained thought.|$|E

5|$|In 1817 an English doctor, James Parkinson, {{published}} his essay reporting six cases of paralysis agitans. An Essay on the Shaking Palsy described the characteristic resting tremor, abnormal posture and gait, paralysis and diminished muscle strength, {{and the way}} that the disease progresses over time. Early neurologists who made further additions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the disease include Trousseau, Gowers, Kinnier Wilson and Erb, and most notably Jean-Martin Charcot, whose studies between 1868 and 1881 were a landmark in the understanding of the disease. Among other advances, he made the distinction between rigidity, weakness and bradykinesia. He also championed the renaming of the disease in honor of James Parkinson.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in the Arab world, by 900 {{the great}} Greek herbals had been {{translated}} and copies lodged in centres {{of learning in}} the Byzantine empire of the eastern Mediterranean including Byzantium, Damascus, Cairo and Baghdad where they were combined with the botanical and pharmacological lore of the Orient. In the medieval Islamic world, Muslim botanists and Muslim physicians made a major contribution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> of herbal medicines. Those associated with this period include Mesue Maior (Masawaiyh, 777–857) who, in his Opera Medicinalia, synthesised the knowledge of Greeks, Persians, Arabs, Indians and Babylonians, this work was complemented by the medical encyclopaedia of Avicenna (Ibn Sina, 980–1037). Avicenna’s Canon of Medicine was used for centuries in both East and West. During this period Islamic science protected classical botanical knowledge that had been ignored in the West and Muslim pharmacy thrived.|$|E
5|$|The delegates couldn't {{agree on}} whether the {{executive}} should be a single person, or a board of three.

This issue came up occasionally after the matter was settled, but was never again seriously doubted.|$|E

25|$|Around 1830, Newman {{developed}} {{a distinction between}} natural religion and revealed religion.

Natural religion refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> of God and divine things that has been acquired outside the Judeo-Christian revelation. For Newman, this knowledge of God is {{not the result of}} unaided reason but of reason aided by grace, and so he speaks of natural religion as containing a revelation, even though it is an incomplete revelation.|$|E
