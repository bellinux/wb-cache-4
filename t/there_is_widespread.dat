5|$|The wind-wind {{collision}} cone {{separates the}} winds of the two stars. For 55–75° behind the secondary, there is a thin hot wind typical of O or Wolf–Rayet stars. This allows some radiation from Eta Carinae B to be detected and its temperature can be estimated with some accuracy due to spectral lines that {{are unlikely to be}} produced by any other source. Although the secondary star has never been directly observed, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>widespread</b> agreement on models where it has a temperature between 37,000K and 41,000K.|$|E
5|$|Today <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>widespread</b> {{agreement}} among archaeologists that the world's first art and symbolic culture {{dates to the}} southern African Middle Stone Age. Some {{of the most striking}} artifacts, including engraved pieces of red ochre, were manufactured at Blombos Cave in South Africa 70 ka. Pierced and ochred Nassarius shell beads were also recovered from Blombos, with even earlier examples (Middle Stone Age, Aterian) from the Taforalt Caves. Arrows and hide working tools have been found at Sibudu Cave as evidence of making weapons with compound heat treated gluing technology.|$|E

5|$|In humans, bites {{from this}} species can produce severe local and {{systemic}} symptoms. Based {{on the degree}} and type of local effect, bites {{can be divided into}} two symptomatic categories: those with little or no surface extravasation, and those with hemorrhages evident as ecchymosis, bleeding and swelling. In both cases there is severe pain and tenderness, but in the latter <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>widespread</b> superficial or deep necrosis and compartment syndrome. Serious bites cause limbs to become immovably flexed as a result of significant hemorrhage or coagulation in the affected muscles. Residual induration, however, is rare and usually these areas completely resolve.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Enlightenment, {{the gospels}} were usually {{regarded}} as accurate historical accounts, {{but since then}} scholars have emerged who question {{the reliability of the}} gospels and draw a distinction between the Jesus described in the gospels and the Jesus of history. Since the 18th century, three separate scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during the quest that applied them. While <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>widespread</b> scholarly agreement on the existence of Jesus, and a basic consensus on the general outline of his life, the portraits of Jesus constructed by various scholars often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospel accounts.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the round ribbontail ray as Vulnerable. It cannot withstand heavy fishing pressure {{due to its}} low reproductive rate, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>widespread</b> degradation of its coral reef habitat, including from agricultural runoff and destructive fishing practices such as blast fishing. This species is caught by commercial and fisheries throughout its range, using line gear and trawls. One region where it is heavily pressured is in Indonesian waters, where it and other large rays are taken intentionally and otherwise by tangle netters, longliners, and trawlers operating off Java, Bali, New Guinea, and Lombok. All landed individuals are brought to market for human consumption.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} approach {{focuses on the}} links between this form of castle {{and what can be}} termed a feudal mode of society. The spread of motte-and-bailey castles was usually closely tied to the creation of local fiefdoms and feudal landowners, and areas without this method of governance rarely built these castles. Yet another theory suggests that the design emerged {{as a result of the}} pressures of space on ringworks, and that the earliest motte-and-baileys were converted ringworks. Finally, there may be a link between the local geography and the building of motte-and-bailey castles, which are usually built on low-lying areas, in many cases subject to regular flooding. Regardless of the reasons behind the initial popularity of the motte-and-bailey design, however, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>widespread</b> agreement that the castles were first widely adopted in Normandy and Angevin territory in the 10th and 11th centuries.|$|E
