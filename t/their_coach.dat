Philadelphia secured its berth in the final by defeating the Harrisburg City Islanders, the New York Cosmos, the New England Revolution, and FC Dallas.

5|$|The 1960s {{were less}} {{successful}} for the club, with Real Madrid monopolising La Liga. The {{completion of the}} Camp Nou, finished in 1957, meant the club had little {{money to spend on}} new players. The 1960s saw the emergence of Josep Maria Fusté and Carles Rexach, and the club won the Copa del Generalísimo in 1963 and the Fairs Cup in 1966. Barcelona restored some pride by beating Real Madrid 1–0 in the 1968 Copa del Generalísimo final at the Santiago Bernabéu – in front of Francisco Franco – with <b>their</b> <b>coach</b> Salvador Artigas, a former republican pilot in the civil war. With the end of Franco's dictatorship in 1974, the club changed its official name back to Futbol Club Barcelona and reverted the crest to its original design, including the original letters once again.|$|E
5|$|Khan {{realizes that}} he can make the girls winners only if he can help them {{overcome}} their differences. During his first few days as coach he benches several players who refuse to follow his rules—including Bindia Naik (Shilpa Shukla), his most experienced player. In response, Bindia repeatedly encourages the other players to defy Khan. When she finally succeeds, Khan angrily resigns; however, he invites the staff and team to a farewell lunch at McDonald's. During the lunch, local boys make a pass at Mary; Balbir attacks them, triggering a brawl between the boys and the team. Khan, recognizing that they are acting as one for the first time, prevents the staff from intervening; he only stops a man from hitting {{one of the women}} from behind with a cricket bat, telling him that there are no cowards in hockey. In an about-face, after the fight the women ask Khan to remain as <b>their</b> <b>coach.</b>|$|E
5|$|Somalia {{received}} universality places (a wildcard {{for athletes}} {{who have not}} attained qualification standards) from the International Association of Athletics Federations to send one male and one female athlete to the 2012 Summer Olympics. The two athletes that were selected to represent Somalia at the London Games were Mohamed Hassan Mohamed in the men's 1500 metres and Zamzam Mohamed Farah in the women's 400 metres. Along with the two athletes, the country's delegation was led by chef de mission Omar Barajab. The athletes' training at Mogadishu Stadium and in the city's roads (which was for six days a week) was hampered {{by the death of}} the country's National Olympic Committee (NOC) president Aden Yabarow Wiish in a suicide bombing in April 2012, but <b>their</b> <b>coach</b> Ahmed Ali encouraged the runners not to let the event influence their training. Both competitors were not confirmed until July 2012 because the NOC did not wish to jeopardise their safety by making them targets. Long-distance runner Abdinasir Said Ibrahim had been due to compete but withdrew because of extreme stress caused by unsafe roads which lowered his mental morale. Farah was selected as the flag bearer for both the opening and closing ceremonies.|$|E

5|$|Steve DeBerg {{opened the}} second half with an 84-yard drive ending in a touchdown, and {{followed}} that with a touchdown pass to Gerald Carter a minute later. The game nearly became {{a repeat of the}} previous week, as the Packers replaced quarterback Don Majkowski with Randy Wright. Wright's two fourth-quarter touchdowns cut into Tampa Bay's 23–3 lead, but this time the offense was able {{to hold on to the}} ball. Two Calvin Magee catches for first downs sealed the victory. The Buccaneers' 17second-half points are credited to the coaching staff's adjustment to the Packers' man-to-man defense. The Buccaneers and Packers both had the same amount of net yards (279), passing yards (190), and rushing yards (89). Donald Igwebuike's three field goals broke Bill Capece's Buccaneer career record. The victory left the Buccaneers in second place in the NFC Central division. This led to speculation as to whether coach Perkins, who had been able to lead the New York Giants to the playoffs in three years as <b>their</b> <b>coach,</b> would be able to repeat the feat in a single year with Tampa Bay.|$|E
5|$|Sue informs Will {{that the}} club {{receiving}} {{payment for the}} commercial revokes their amateur status, and thus their eligibility to compete at sectionals. Quinn, who {{has been trying to}} convince Sue to let her appear in the cheerleaders' photographs despite being removed from the team due to her pregnancy, reminds Sue that as <b>their</b> <b>coach</b> she has often given the cheerleaders perks which would also render them ineligible for competition. She demands that Sue sacrifice one of the cheerleaders' six pages in the yearbook to the glee club. Sue agrees, and accepts Quinn back onto the cheerleading team, but Quinn tells her she no longer wishes to be a cheerleader. Will announces that he will not be accompanying the club to sectionals, as {{he was the one who}} accepted payment, and as such they will only be allowed to compete without his involvement. The glee club then has their group photograph taken for the yearbook, but the copy in the library is subsequently defaced by hockey player Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) and football player Azimio (James Earl).|$|E
5|$|Million Dollar Challenge is a {{poker game}} show where amateur poker players attempt to defeat celebrities, {{professional}} poker players and, eventually, Daniel Negreanu {{in order to}} win the show's grand prize, $1 million. In the first round, the amateur (with Negreanu at their side, acting as <b>their</b> <b>coach</b> and lending advice) must defeat a celebrity such as Jayde Nicole, Jerome Bettis, Joanna Krupa, John Salley or Tito Ortiz. If the contestant is able to defeat the celebrity the contestant wins a trip to the Bahamas and advances to the second round. In the second round, the amateur (with Negreanu now helping them from a sound proof booth, giving them advice through a listening device in the amateur's ear) must defeat a professional poker player such as Vanessa Rousso, Barry Greenstein, Joe Cada or Chris Moneymaker. If the contestant is able to defeat the professional the contestant wins $25,000 in addition to the trip to the Bahamas. At this point, the amateur has a decision to make. Keep the money and walk away $25,000 richer, or risk the money (the trip is still theirs to keep) and play Daniel Negreanu heads-up for $100,000, knowing that if they lose they walk away with nothing but the trip to the Bahamas. In the season finale, the champions from each episode compete against each other in a sit-n-go tournament, the winner of which plays Negreanu for $1 million.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2010 This study {{sought to}} gain a better {{understanding}} of the communication behaviors between coaches and male and female athletes. Four focus groups (male coach and male athletes, male coach and female athlete, female coach and male athletes, and female coach and female athletes) were used to assess athletes' perceptions of their past coaches' communication behavior compared to <b>their</b> preferred <b>coach</b> communication behaviors. Coding of the focus groups revealed that although females prefer to talk to <b>their</b> <b>coaches</b> about topics related to running, they also wanted to talk about more personal topics. However, for females to talk about personal topics they needed to feel comfortable with <b>their</b> <b>coaches,</b> which was dependent on the coaches' characteristics. Conversely, males desired to talk to <b>their</b> <b>coaches</b> about more serious topics, such as their training and competition, as well as other professional runners' training and competition. Although males desired to more often talk about serious topics, they also recognized there were times when joking around and being less serious with <b>their</b> <b>coaches</b> was appropriate and necessary. In short, men preferred to talk 'shop' more than women did. Based on these results, suggestions for coaches are discussed...|$|R
