Lisa tells him that capturing and enjoying the best moments in life can make it fun, and Bart realizes she is right after Homer pushes him down the ice slide, with the whole family joining in. The final scene is a flash-forward to an elderly Bart in a retirement home, commenting on how much fun his life has been.|$|E

5|$|The Council of Regency, the Royal Audiencia of Buenos Aires and the peninsulars {{opposed the}} new situation. The Royal Audiencia {{secretly}} swore {{allegiance to the}} Council of Regency a month later and sent communiqués to the other cities of the Viceroyalty, to request them to deny recognition to the new government. To {{put an end to}} these activities, the Junta assembled Cisneros and {{all the members of the}} Royal Audiencia on the pretext <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> were in danger, and sent them into exile aboard the British ship Dart. Captain Mark Brigut Larrea was instructed to avoid American ports and deliver all of them directly to the Canary Islands. The Junta then appointed a new Audiencia composed entirely of criollos loyal to the revolution.|$|E

25|$|William's {{victory at}} the Boyne, {{together}} with James' flight, {{might have been the}} end of the war in Ireland. However, William published very harsh peace terms in the Declaration of Finglas, excluding the Jacobite officers and the Irish Catholic landed class from the pardon he offered to Jacobite foot-soldiers. As a result, Irish Jacobite leaders felt they had no choice but to fight until they received guarantees <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> property, and civil and religious rights would be respected in a peace settlement.|$|E

25|$|Praising {{the crimes}} of totalitarian governments and denigrating their victims is {{forbidden}} by law in Romania; this includes the Ceaușescu era. Dinel Staicu was fined 25,000 lei (approx. 9,000 United States dollars) for praising Ceaușescu and displaying his pictures on his private television channel (3TV Oltenia). Nevertheless, according to opinion polls held in 2010, 41% of Romanians would vote for Ceaușescu and 63% think <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> were better before 1989. In 2014, the percentage {{of those who would}} vote for Ceaușescu reached 46%.|$|E
25|$|Stephen and Suzanne Roper, {{who live}} only 100 {{yards from the}} park, say <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> have been made a misery by {{the noise of the}} screams as well as {{fireworks}} displays and music. They launched their legal fight in 2002, but after years of wrangling, their claim for an injunction and damages was thrown out in January 2011. Judge Mr Justice Hickinbottom later overturned that decision, bringing the claim back. This now paves the way for a full court hearing. The Ropers will seek an injunction forcing the park owners to close or relocate some rides and an order forcing them to pay damages for noise suffered from 1998 to the present.|$|E

25|$|Little Orphan Annie {{was also}} parodied in {{an episode of}} the stop-motion {{television}} series Robot Chicken in which Little Orphan Annie fails to grasp {{the true meaning of}} a hard knock life when a fellow orphan shows <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> are relatively decent compared to orphans around the world. Annie reappears in another episode as a vulgar, demanding, and spoiled teenager featured in a parodic documentary chronicling her preparations for her ostentatious upcoming sixteenth birthday celebration in a sketch lampooning reality programs based on the same concept. She quickly tires of her gift from Daddy Warbucks— the planet Mars— and soon winds up suffocating to death after losing her helmet while exploring the planet.|$|E
25|$|Chainfire {{continues}} {{the story of}} Richard {{in his attempt to}} teach the people <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> are theirs alone, and that they can be free of the Imperial Order. Richard is gravely injured from an enemy's arrow. He is brought to Nicci, a sorceress and former Sister of the Dark, who heals him using Subtractive Magic; this causes unforeseen events to spiral out of control. When Richard awakens, he discovers that his wife, Kahlan Amnell, the Mother Confessor, is missing. Furthermore, no one around him seems to remember her. Nicci and Cara both attribute Richard's memory of Kahlan to dreams and delusions brought on by his injury and possibly an unintended effect of the Subtractive Magic used in healing Richard. Despite Richard's attempts to explain {{the events of the last}} several years could not have happened without Kahlan, the paradoxes are explained away as Richard remembering things inaccurately.|$|E
25|$|Some {{news outlets}} have called into {{question}} why the Baltimore County Crisis Intervention Team was not deployed. Police say trained negotiators were involved but could not respond {{as to why the}} unit was not dispatched. Others suggest there are deficiencies in the way law enforcement attempt to deescalate interactions in minority communities, suggesting that Gaines' interactions with police may have been shaped by attitudes and beliefs regarding police and the justice system in urban black communities. According to Vox Media reports, legally, the police officers only must reasonably believe <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> were in immediate danger, but are not required to ascertain whether the shooting victim actually posed a threat, however, activists maintain the police should have sought other means of resolving the conflict. Others have called for the hiring of more female police officers, arguing that policewomen {{would be less likely to}} use lethal force to resolve conflicts.|$|E

25|$|In 1863 {{during the}} American Civil War, Dr. Howe was {{appointed}} to the American Freedmen's Inquiry Commission, and traveled both to the Deep South and to Canada to investigate the condition of emancipated slaves. Freedmen in Canada had often reached it via the Underground Railroad. Life in Canada wasn’t free from the bigotry that Freedmen and women suffered in the northern states as well as the South, but Howe found <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> as free people were much improved. He noted that they were enfranchised and their rights protected by the government. Howe noted they were free to earn a living, marry, attend school and church {{out of the reach of}} slave-catchers. An account of his interviews and experiences were published in 1864, The Refugees from Slavery in Canada West. He submitted his report to the Secretary of War, and it became part of the Commission's material for Congress. It contributed to passage of the law establishing the Freedmen's Bureau, considered needed to aid the southern freedmen in transition.|$|E
25|$|Mahmud Pasha {{drew up a}} {{document}} outlining the terms of surrender, and swore by his sword and by the Sultan's head <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> would be safe. Niccolò also demanded that he be given, in recompense, a domain of equivalent value. Learning of the surrender, Mehmed again crossed to the island, where he remained for four days. Accompanied by the notables of Mytilene, Niccolò surrendered the keys of the fortress to the Sultan, and begged for his forgiveness. Mehmed accepted, and instructed him to order the surrender of the other forts on the island—Methymna, Eressos, and Agioi Theodoroi (probably near Antissa)—as well. Niccolò complied, sending a letter with his seal to the forts, urging their garrisons to submit. The garrison of Agioi Theodoroi sent emissaries to Cappello offering to surrender the fort to Venice instead, but he refused. After allowing his troops to celebrate their victory in a drunken feast, in which the remaining houses of the Melanoudion quarter were burned down, Mehmed installed a garrison of 200 Janissaries and 300 irregular infantry (azaps) as a garrison in Mytilene, and entrusted its governance to the Persian sheikh Ali al-Bistami.|$|E
25|$|Plotting to {{kill his}} brothers-in-law, Atli dispatches {{messengers}} to Gunnarr and Högni, the sons of Gjúki, with an invitation to his hall. Guðrún, daughter of Gjúki and Atli's wife, learns about the plot and sends a runic message to her brothers but the runes are corrupted {{by one of the}} messengers, Vingi. Nevertheless, Kostbera, Högni's wife, discerns from the runes that something is wrong and warns Högni. Högni dismisses her fears but she persists and describes dreadful dreams she has had, interpreting them as warnings. Högni remains unmoved and explains the dreams away. Glaumvör, Gunnarr's wife, has also had bad dreams which she describes to her husband, who also attempts to explain them away. Eventually Gunnarr admits <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> may be short but tells Glaumvör that he cannot evade his doom. The brothers set out to Atli with only three companions. The women follow the brothers to a fjord where their ways must part. Glaumvör reminds Vingi of the sanctity due to a guest and he swears that there is no deception. Kostbera and Högni say farewell to each other and the men row away.|$|E
