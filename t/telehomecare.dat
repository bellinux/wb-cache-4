50|$|<b>Telehomecare</b> (THC) is a {{subfield}} within telehealth. It {{involves the}} delivery of healthcare services to patients at home {{through the use of}} telecommunications technologies, which enable the interaction of voice, video, and health-related data.

50|$|<b>Telehomecare</b> {{involves}} an electronic 2-way {{communication between the}} patient and the care provider, generally a nurse. The communication is usually in the form of audio/video conferencing, using the Internet. In addition to conferencing, medical monitoring equipment can be installed in the patient’s home, and readings transmitted electronically to the care provider. Patient satisfaction is high with this type of intervention (Finkelstein, Speedie, & Pottfoff, 2006).|$|E

THC increases the accessibility to health care services especially {{as the need for}} homecare rises with the aging population. [...] Additionally, THC can help create networks of services between hospitals and primary care providers, thereby allowing patients better access to services. In addition to improving management of chronic conditions and increasing access to healthcare, THC is believed to reduce costs of healthcare.|$|E

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{home health care}} has skyrocketed in recent years. The aging {{population}} and the push for more efficient delivery of hospital services have fueled this growing demand. However, health care financing reforms have constrained the industry's growth. Home health agencies struggle to deliver high-quality services while staying within the financiallimitations imposed by reimbursement changes. <b>Telehomecare</b> {{is one way to}} provide cost-effective care in the current environment. Personal computers and video equipment can transmit data over ordinary telephone lines and allow home health providers to monitor patients and provide care at a much lower cost than earlier technologies that required wider bandwidth telephone lines and more complex equipment. But can <b>telehomecare</b> yield cost-savings for home health agencies? This article addresses the costs associated with a <b>telehomecare</b> intervention in a large, urban, home health agency.

40|$|Heart failure (HF) is {{the leading}} cause of rehospitalization in the United State. One {{potential}} way to reduce HF rehospitalizations is through the use of <b>telehomecare,</b> which is a remote monitoring intervention in home care settings. However, studies on <b>telehomecare</b> use conducted in the United States have demonstrated mixed results in reducing HF rehospitalizations. Little is known about risk factors for rehospitalization during a <b>telehomecare</b> episode. The aims of the study were to identify patient characteristics associated with all-cause rehospitalizations and patient characteristics associated with time-to-first rehospitalization within 60 days of the home health care episode. This is a non-experimental, cross-sectional secondary analysis of the Outcome Assessment Information Set dataset from Medicare recipients with HF provided with <b>telehomecare.</b> This study used multiple logistic regression, decision tree techniques and survival analysis methods. The main findings of this study were that results of a formal pain assessment and the ability to dress one 2 ̆ 7 s lower body safely were associated with rehospitalizations. In particular, subjects who were independent in dressing their lower body had a consistently higher risk of rehospitalization than functionally dependent groups. While the logistic regression model and survival analysis presented the associations between rehospitalization and single risk factors, the decision tree techniques presented the relative contributions of and interactions between risk factors for rehospitalization as a global picture, which may provide clinicians with a visual guide to targeting those patients most likely to benefit from <b>telehomecare,</b> or who may need additional interventions. ...|$|E

Successful {{home health care}} outcomes depend on social and technical interactions within diverse patient, caregiver and nurse triad groups. No theory or analysis method for evaluating <b>telehomecare</b> service delivery as a multi-level system exists. Therefore, {{it is not known}} which characteristics of interpersonal relationships influence outcomes. This research examined trust, interdependence, communication and technology integration influence on outcomes of satisfaction and self-care. The Sociotechnical Systems Theory and Social Relations Model served as guides to explore individual, relational and group effects on patient quality outcomes. The purpose of this research is to examine the relationships among patients', caregivers' and nurses' social and technical characteristics and quality outcomes in <b>telehomecare.</b> Three VHA sites in the western U. S. participated in this descriptive, multi-level, correlational study. Forty-three groups comprised of patient, nurse and caregiver provided survey data on social and technical characteristics. Additionally, patients provided data on outcomes. All scales performed well, except trust. Results show statistically significant bivariate correlations demonstrate associations between characteristics and outcomes at multi-levels: interdependence with satisfaction at individual and dyad levels; communication with satisfaction at all levels of analysis and simple self care at individual levels; technology integration with satisfaction at group levels as wells as simple and complex self care at individual levels. The principle of joint optimization states that service delivery systems function optimally only if the social and technical characteristics of the subsystem groups fit the demands of each other and the environment. A measure of joint optimization is computed for outcome predictability using multiple regressions. Joint optimization for three social and one technical characteristic was shown to have significant influences on the patient's perception of being well cared for. Many implications of this research for nursing practice in <b>telehomecare</b> are discussed. <b>Telehomecare</b> nurses can use {{the results of this study}} to guide optimal practice methods to provide quality outcomes for their patients.

40|$|The study’s {{objectives}} were to measure patients ’ {{perceptions of a}} <b>telehomecare</b> system before and after they have participated in it and identify {{the features of the}} system that patients per-ceived differently after experiencing it. The study setting was the <b>TeleHomeCare</b> Project, which uses videoconferencing and Internet equipment to enable interactions between pa-tients and nurses. An instrument that measures perceptions of <b>telehomecare</b> was used. Pa-tients viewed a videotape that demonstrates a “virtual home care visit ” and filled out the questionnaire (pre-test). They were then randomly assigned to a control group receiving stan-dard care or to an experimental group receiving videoconferencing and Internet access in ad-dition to standard care. Both groups filled out the questionnaire when exiting the system (post-test). Paired t-tests were performed to compare total scores and responses to each of the items within the groups and an unpaired t-test was used to compare change of perceptions between groups. The control group consisted of 11 patients, and the experimental group in-cluded 17 patients. There was no statistically significant change of perception in the control group. The experimental group showed an overall more positive perception of the system af-ter their experience (total score increase by 6. 059, p, 0. 0001), and the mean score difference was higher compared to the control group (mean 6. 241, p, 0. 0001).

40|$|Background: Poor glycemic {{control in}} {{patients}} with diabetes mellitus can increase associated complications and mortality. We use the <b>telehomecare</b> system {{in patients with}} diabetes and investigate the associated impact in clinical practice. Materials and Methods: The {{purpose of the study}} is to examine the effectiveness of the <b>telehomecare</b> system on diabetic self-care. The <b>telehomecare</b> system incorporated into the daily care program in the experimental group. A cloud health-care platform designed for information storage and exchange be constructed and monitored by case managers. Comprehensive care instructions and in-time consultation in case of abnormalities were provided. The patients in the control group adopted conventional care program. Self-care questionnaires were completed by both groups before and after the study. All participants measured before the experiment and at 4 months after. Results: The participants were 117 patients (including 56 at the experimental and 61 at the control group), which recruited from a community hospital in New Taipei city, Taiwan. In two-way mixed design ANCOVA, in self-care behaviors, there are significant differences between two groups. The outcome of experimental group is superior to the control group both in posttest.

40|$|Although the {{usefulness}} of <b>telehomecare</b> has been recognized, and all technologies required are readily available, expectations for its widespread adoption have not been realized. This pa-per presents {{the development of a}} portable <b>telehomecare</b> monitoring system (PTMS). What sets this work apart from most other systems is the focus on a highly decentralized monitoring model and the portable nature of the system. We believe that this is the approach that is needed to make such systems economically viable and acceptable to the end-users. The PTMS is a de-centralized system, in which a single household is the fundamental unit for sensing, data trans-mission, data storage and analysis. It is not necessary to subscribe service from a health wel-fare center, and the infrastructure required is minimal, too. Equipped with different sensors, the PTMS can be used for long-term personal health data management in a home environment, and it can be easily implemented in a home environment at very low cost. Similar to the large-scale <b>telehomecare</b> systems, the PTMS also provides caregivers with convenient access to the health data and real-time event-driven messages in urgent situations.

40|$|Objectives: There is no {{systematic}} review on economic evaluations of telemedicine in Japan, despite over 1000 trials implemented. Our {{systematic review}} {{aims to examine}} whether Japan’s telemedicine is cost-saving or cost-effective, examine the methodological rigorousness of the economic evaluations, and discuss future studies needed to improve telemedicine’s financial sustainability. Methods: We searched five databases, including two Japanese databases, to find peer-reviewed articles published between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2014 in English and Japanese that performed economic evaluations of Japan’s telemedicine programs. The methodological rigorousness of the economic analyses was assessed with a well-established checklist. We calculated the benefit-to-cost ratio (BCR) when a reviewed study reported related data but did not report the BCR. All cost values were adjusted to 2014 US dollars. Results: Among the 17 articles identified, six studies reported on settings connecting physicians for specialist consultations, and eleven studies on settings connecting healthcare providers and patients at home. There are three cost-benefit analyses and three cost-minimization analyses. The remaining studies measured the benefit of telemedicine only, using medical expenditure saved or users’ willingness-to-pay. There was substantial diversity in the methodological rigorousness. Studies on teledermatology and teleradiology indicated a favorable level of economic efficiency. Studies on <b>telehomecare</b> gave mixed results. One cost-benefit analysis on <b>telehomecare</b> indicated a low economic efficiency, partly due to public subsidy rules, e. g., a too short budget period. Conclusions: Overall, telemedicine programs in Japan were indicated to have a favorable level of economic efficiency. However, the scarcity of the economic literature indicates {{the need for further}} rigorous economic evaluation studies...|$|E
