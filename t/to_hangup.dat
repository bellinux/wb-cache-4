40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{investigated}} preheating of continuously fed, fragmented {{ferrous scrap}} charges by furnace offgases and utilizing substitutes for imported fluorspar to condition electric steelmaking slags. Three types of continuous scrap charging procedures were investigated to determine electrical energy consumption in a I-st (short ton) electric arc furnace. Cold and preheated scrap charges were continuously fed at rates averaging 37. 5 and 43. 7 lb/min, respectively. The feed rate varied appreciably from test to test owing <b>to</b> <b>hangup</b> of the scrap in the charge bin. Approximately 7 pct less electrical energy was consumed in melting scrap preheated to 8400 to 1, 1100 F by furnace off-gases than in melting cold scrap. Overall energy consumptions were 888 kW'h/st for cold scrap, 829 kW'h/st for preheated scrap" and 637 kW'h/st for conventional backcharged scrap. Stack gases from scrap preheating averaged 1200 F and a flow rate of 1, 615 scfm compared with 2200 F and 1, 302 sefm for cold-charged scrap. Slag conditioners tested included synthetic fluorspar, boric acid, hydroboracite, used aluminum potlining wastes and aluminum anode tailing wastes, and Sorelflux B. The boron-containing conditioners fluidized the slags the best, followed in order by the conditioners containing fluorine and titanium...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a generalized nonlinear (Markov) analysis technique {{that is used}} to evaluate the statistical performance of uniforn ly sampled digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) demodulators. Although the rigorous analysis of the statistical performance of the analog PLL for digitally modulated signals (i. e., Costas loops) remains an open problem, the discrete time analysis for MPSK modulation is tractable. This paper characterizes the first-order, decisiondirected DPLL based demodulator as a Markov chain. Traditional analytical techniques are used to evaluate the steady-state statistical performance. Numerical results for the steady-state density function are derived for BPSK, QPSK, and 8 PSK. The resulting steady-state bit error probabilities for these modulations are also calculated. Traditional Markov analytical techniques (absorbing boundaries) permit a numerical evaluation of the transient characteristics of the DPLL. The numerical work focuses on loops for both unmodulated and BPSK, QPSK, andl 8 PSK modulated input signals. The transient characteristics are shown to be a function of the loop bandwidth but converge to those predicted by a diffusion analysis as the loop bandwidth decreases. The susceptibility of small bandwidth loops <b>to</b> <b>hangup</b> is shown to be the largest reason for the acquisition performance difference. The cycle slipping characterization for 2 ̆ 7 MPSK modulated signals is also a function of the loop bandwidth and each increase (doubling) of the modulation alphabet size reduces the slipping performance by approximately 6 dB...|$|E

2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the [...] "dialogo" [...] between a group of prominent Miami Cubans, led by Bernardo Benes, and the Cuban government, secret bilateral talks were held in Mexico City in which Cuba agreed to release 2500 political prisoners at the rate of 500 per month and the US agreed to take them. The Cubans released the first tranche and an initial high-profile group, including Polita Grau and Tony Cuesta was moved to the US expeditiously. However, due <b>to</b> bureaucratic <b>hangups</b> about parole quotas, INS scheduling, and name checks it was soon apparent that the US could not process the prisoners fast enough to maintain the release schedule. The Cubans continued to release the prisoners as scheduled but the processing did not keep up mainly due to name check delays. By late August, the US was hopelessly behind in processing the released prisoners, some of whom had married after release. As the non-aligned meeting approached the Cubans threatened to set up a camp for the unprocessed prisoners in front of the Interest Section and drive the delegates to the international meeting past to show them how the US lives up to its commitments. [...] Even this threat failed to accelerate the process although the Interests Section staff did all it could. Washington hang ups were slow to resolve but the Cubans did not set up the threatened camp.|$|R

40|$|The Space Shuttle vehicle (SSV) is {{connected}} to the mobile launch platform (MLP) by four aft skirt hold down studs on each solid rocket booster (SRB). Prior to lift-off, the frangible nuts inside the aft skirt blast containers (BC) are severed into two nut halves by two pyrotechnic booster cartridges. This action releases the SSV and allows the hold down studs to eject through the aft skirt bore and then down into the MLP. USBI has been tasked to upgrade the BC for two specific reasons; 1. to eliminate lead for environmental concerns, and 2. to reduce the chance of nut recontact with the holddown stud. Nut recontact with the stud has been identified as a likely contributor <b>to</b> stud <b>hangups.</b> This upgrade will replace the lead liner with an aluminum foam material. The aluminum foam used as a energy absorber is a proven design in many other aerospace/defense applications. Additional benefits of using the open cell, energy absorbent aluminum foam in place of the solid lead liner are: A. Lead handling/ exposure, and possible contamination, along with hazardous waste disposal will be eliminated; B. Approximately 200 lbs. weight savings will be contributed to each Space Shuttle flight by using aluminum foam over lead; C. The new aluminum liner is designed to catch all shrapnel from frangible nuts thus virtually eliminating chance of foreign object debris (FOD) exiting the HDP, and causing potential damage to the vehicle; D. Potential of using the lighter aluminum liner over lead, allows for easier assembly and disassembly of blast container elements, also allowing for improvements in safety, operator handling, and efficiency of operations. Six BC firing tests will be required to determine if the new liner material will perform in a way to decrease the chance of stud hangups and enhance the ability of the BC to retain blast debris. Testing will be performed at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) facility known as the Launch Equipment Test Facility (LETF), and will simulate the SRB hold- down post, with actual BC hardware and pyrotechnics assembled, and then test fired. Initial testing was performed in 1997 using a frangible nut in a static drop test over lead and aluminum foam sheet materials. The aluminum foam showed a dramatic improvement of energy absorption over the lead liner material. Proof-of-Principle testing at the KSC-LETF commenced in May, 1998, and is expected to be completed by June, 1998...|$|R

5000|$|The feminist group Cell 16, {{founded in}} 1968 by Roxanne Dunbar, {{was known for}} its program of celibacy and {{separation}} from men, among other things. Considered too extreme by many mainstream feminists, the organization acted {{as a sort of}} hard left vanguard. It has been cited as the first organization to advance the concept of separatist feminism. In No More Fun and Games, the organization's radical feminist periodical, Cell Members Roxanne Dunbar and Lisa Leghorn advised women to [...] "separate from men who are not consciously working for female liberation", but advised periods of celibacy, rather than lesbian relationships, which they considered to be [...] "nothing more than a personal solution." [...] The periodical also published Dana Densmore's article [...] "On Celibacy" [...] (October 1968), which stated in part, [...] "One <b>hangup</b> <b>to</b> liberation is a supposed 'need' for sex. It is something that must be refuted, coped with, demythified, or the cause of female liberation is doomed. Already we see girls, thoroughly liberated in their own heads, understanding their oppression with terrible clarity trying, deliberately and a trace hysterically, to make themselves attractive to men, men for whom they have no respect, men they may even hate, because of 'a basic sexual-emotional need.' Sex is not essential to life, as eating is. Some people go through their whole lives without engaging in it at all, including fine, warm, happy people. It is a myth that this makes one bitter, shriveled up, twisted. The big stigma of life-long virginity is on women anyway, created by men because woman's purpose in life is biological and if she doesn't fulfill that she's warped and unnatural and 'must be all cobwebs inside.'" ...|$|R
