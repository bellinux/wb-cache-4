50|$|Violence was to rear {{its ugly}} head at several matches in 1988, the round five clash between New Norfolk and Glenorchy at Boyer Oval {{featured}} several ugly incidents on-field and during the last quarter a brawl erupted in the main grandstand, play was halted as up to 100 people surged across the ground {{to join in the}} melee as spectators seated in the stand scattered to escape the violence, a large group of fans milled around the boundary line in front of the stand <b>to</b> <b>hurl</b> <b>abuse</b> which was eventually broken up by police officers.|$|E
5000|$|Discovering he is {{completely}} alone, Bérenger laments his behavior with Daisy. In his solitude {{he begins to}} doubt his existence - his language, his appearance, and his mind. Alone, he finds himself in the wrong and attempts to change into a rhinoceros. He struggles and fails. He returns to the mirror, face-to-face with his fate and breaks down as he struggles to accept the place he has given himself. Suddenly, he snaps {{out of it and}} renews his vow to take on the rhinos. Bérenger valiantly shouts [...] "I'm not capitulating!" [...] to the audience before returning to the window <b>to</b> <b>hurl</b> <b>abuse</b> at the passing rhinoceros.|$|E
50|$|As {{his earlier}} offers {{had been so}} rudely rejected, Alexios at first {{intended}} to have Gregory blinded—the customary punishment for rebellion—but was dissuaded by John, who pleaded for clemency for his cousin; instead, Gregory's hair and beard were shaved, and he was paraded around the streets of Constantinople before being thrown into the Prison of Anemas. At first, Gregory remained obstinate and continued <b>to</b> <b>hurl</b> <b>abuse</b> on the emperor from his cell, but after the intercession of Gregory's friend Nikephoros Bryennios the Younger, the husband of Anna Komnene, he was persuaded to recant and beseech the emperor's pardon. In the end, {{he was not only}} released and pardoned, but accorded even higher honours. B. Skoulatos considers him the same as the namesake protovestiarios {{who was one of the}} chief ministers in the early reign of John II Komnenos (r. 1118-1143), but he is usually considered a different person.|$|E
2500|$|The paratroopers disembarked {{and began}} seizing people. There were many claims of paratroopers beating people, {{clubbing}} them with rifle butts, firing rubber bullets {{at them from}} close range, making threats <b>to</b> kill, and <b>hurling</b> <b>abuse.</b> The Saville Report agreed that soldiers [...] "used excessive force when arresting people [...] as well as seriously assaulting them {{for no good reason}} while in their custody".|$|R

5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the domestic league, EuroLeague success proved elusive. The campaign started in early October, {{but it was the}} opening group stage game on 29 October 1992 that brought Danilović an uncomfortable away trip to play against Cibona in Zagreb. He thus became the very first Serb to play a competitive game in the newly independent Croatia after the breakup of Yugoslavia while the Yugoslav Wars were in full swing. Rattled by playing in an extremely hostile atmosphere, Danilović had a poor shooting night making 5 of 15 field goals, good for only 12 points as Virtus lost by 16. Talking about the Zagreb experience, later in 1996, Danilović said: [...] "Traveling to the game I assumed there would be issues, but I certainly didn't expect that much hate. Eight thousand people showed up just to insult a Serb. Getting through that game was not easy at all for me and you can tell from my stats. Even their player Franjo Arapović as well as their head coach Aco Petrović were hostile before the game even started wanting <b>to</b> <b>hurl</b> <b>abuse</b> at me, but I managed to put them in their place once we got out on the court. Also I think the two of them realized they had a rematch to play in Bologna in a few months so they didn't want to antagonize me too much". In the rematch on home court in January 1993, inspired Danilović led the way with 9 of 12 field goal shooting and 23 points as Virtus jumped out to an early lead, recording a 40-point win by the end. Barely making it out of the group stage in the last qualifying spot with a 6-6 record meant that in their quarterfinal best-of-three series Virtus would face the top-placed team from the other group — formidable Real Madrid squad led by Arvydas Sabonis. Virtus got blown out by Real, losing the first game on home court at PalaDozza by 20 points with Danilović scoring 4 points while five days later in Madrid, Real finished the job with another convincing victory, this time by 21 points.|$|E

50|$|The {{north and}} the south should refrain from seeking or fomenting confrontation, cease all manner of {{political}} disputes and stop <b>hurling</b> <b>abuses</b> and slanders at each other.

5000|$|British Muslim activist Anas Altikriti, has {{strongly}} criticised Butt, arguing that, [...] "Now that he {{has changed}} sides, rather than see the error in the methodology and ideology to which he once subscribed and which he peddled for years, he has adopted the posture of extremist once again - and is <b>hurling</b> <b>abuse</b> once more, albeit from the opposite side."
