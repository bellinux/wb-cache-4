5|$|After Indiana {{returned}} to active duty, she {{participated in the}} invasion of Hollandia in western New Guinea. <b>The</b> <b>ship</b> then {{returned to}} the central Pacific and bombarded Truk, and subsequently took part in operations off the Marianas Islands. On 19 June 1944 a Japanese torpedo bomber attempted to attack <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> but Indianas anti-aircraft gunners managed to destroy both the aircraft and the torpedo it had dropped, with no damage to <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> Shortly thereafter, a second Japanese plane was shot down, but a third managed to crash into <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> The aircraft disintegrated upon striking the side armor plates and scattered pieces of the plane across the stern.

5|$|Despite being decommissioned, {{repair work}} on <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> continued. <b>The</b> <b>ship</b> was moved in April to Pillau in the Baltic, to put Admiral Hipper {{out of the}} reach of Allied bombers. A year later, <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> was moved to Gotenhafen; the Kriegsmarine {{intended}} to re-commission <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> so she could be used in the Baltic. Over the next five months, Admiral Hipper ran a series of sea trials in the Baltic, but failed to reach operational status. As the Soviet army pushed the Germans back on the Eastern Front, her crew was drafted into construction work on the defenses of the city, further impairing Admiral Hippers ability to enter active service. The Royal Air Force also laid an extensive minefield around the port, which forced <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> to remain in the harbor.|$|E
5|$|Georgia was {{transferred}} to the Pacific Fleet shortly thereafter, departing from Boston on 16 July 1919.

After her commissioning in April 1939, Admiral Hipper steamed into the Baltic Sea to conduct training maneuvers. <b>The</b> <b>ship</b> also made port calls to various Baltic ports, including cities in Estonia and Sweden.

She was briefly used to patrol the Baltic, {{but she did not}} see combat, and was quickly returned to training exercises. In November 1939, <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> returned to the Blohm & Voss dockyard for modifications; these included the replacement of the straight stem with a clipper bow and the installation of the funnel cap.|$|E
5|$|The German navy found <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> {{to be very}} stiff in her {{sea-keeping}} qualities.

The ship's crew numbered 28officers and 371 enlisted men. She carried a number of smaller boats aboard, including two launches, one pinnace, two cutters, one yawl, and one dinghy. <b>The</b> <b>ship</b> also carried {{an unknown number of}} picket boats and barges.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ship</b> saw {{extensive}} {{service in}} World War II, which Italy entered in June 1940.

In the course of these operations, she {{took part in the}} battles at Calabria, Cape Spartivento, and First and Second Sirte. Gorizia was also attacked numerous times by Allied bombers while in port, culminating in a major raid in April 1943 that inflicted serious damage to <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> Under repair when Italy surrendered to the Allies in September, <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> was seized by occupying Germany forces, who found <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> to be unusable and so abandoned her. Italian and British frogmen tried unsuccessfully to sink <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> in 1944.

5|$|Under a {{bareboat charter}} by the United States Maritime Commission, Agwileon carried {{civilian}} technicians and advisors to Sierra Leone for the U.S. Army.

5|$|A {{contract}} to build <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> {{that would become}} Agincourt was signed on 3June 1911, and its keel was laid on 14September 1911. The design called for a staggering fourteen 12-inch guns, something historian David Topliss attributed to political necessity: <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> had to appear more powerful to the Brazilian populace than her predecessors (with twelve 12-inch guns) but, without increasing the gun size, the only option left was increasing {{the total number of}} guns.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later Luis is elected Chair of the ship's ruling council, and helps bring about a {{settlement}} wherein the people on board can choose {{whether or not to}} stay on <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> and also choose whether <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> stays in orbit around Hsin Ti Chiu. Hsing has a child by Hiroshi, but Hiroshi dies soon afterward, of heart failure. The ship's educational curriculum is revised, and all schools are required to allow teachers who are not angels to teach material relevant to living on the new planet. The new planet proves to be habitable by humans, and around a quarter of the ship's population moves to it, settling down despite the difficulty of learning to live on a planet again. <b>The</b> <b>ship</b> leaves, not intending to return.|$|E

5|$|A third ship, the Manantico also {{crashed into}} shore {{due to a}} {{combination}} of the storm and human error in which the captain confused Cape Henry with Cape Charles after spotting another schooner. The Manantico was also where the two deaths associated with the storm occurred. The first was when a cook on <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> was crushed to death by the cargo of lumber being hauled by <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> <b>The</b> <b>ship</b> was then pushed towards a sand bar. The captain, who had stayed high on the starboard side for safety, began climbing down to slip <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> cables, but <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> made a sudden stop. This flung the captain into the water, and he drowned. Both bodies were found after the storm and were very disfigured. The captain was sent to Middletown, Connecticut for interment while the body of the cook was buried on the beach. The final ship was the Harriet Thomas, which was the schooner spotted by the Manantico. After beaching, the crew managed to get a rope to shore where fishermen had tied the other end. The crew were able to climb ashore, although the captain had to be rescued via alternate means due to being too heavy for this method. <b>The</b> <b>ship</b> was written off as a $7000 (1887 USD) loss. Although all four ships were beached, due to the loss of communications, only one wreck – that of the Mary D. Cranmer – was reported in the Norfolk Virginian newspaper. As a result, news of the two deaths from the Manantico were initially unreported.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Hipper {{left the}} Norwegian theater in September 1940 for an {{overhaul}} in Wilhelmshaven.

The engine oil feed system caught fire and was severely damaged. The fire forced the crew to shut down the ship's propulsion system until the blaze could be brought under control; this rendered Admiral Hipper motionless for several hours on the open sea. British reconnaissance failed to locate <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> and after the fire was extinguished, <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> returned to Hamburg's Blohm & Voss shipyard, where repairs lasted slightly over a week.|$|E
