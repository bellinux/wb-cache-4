6000|$|His partner {{nodded his}} head, loth {{to hear his}} own voice break the stillness. They trudged on in uneasy silence <b>till</b> <b>surprised</b> by an open door. Above this door, and {{stretching}} {{the width of the}} building, a rude sign announced the same as the [...] "Monte Carlo." [...] But beside the door, hat over eyes, chair tilted back, a man sat sunning himself. He was an old man. Beard and hair were long and white and patriarchal.|$|E
6000|$|... "I 'm {{not going}} to tell Tom a word about it, but keep it for a <b>surprise</b> <b>till</b> he comes. He will be here next week, and then we 'll have a grand {{clearing}} up of mysteries," [...] said Fan, evidently feeling that the millennium was at hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "It shall be. Now I'll {{tell you}} what I was going to keep as a <b>surprise</b> <b>till</b> to-night, for I wanted to have my secret {{as well as other}} folks. Ed and I went up to see Bob, Sunday, and he said he'd join the Lodge, if they'd have him. I'm going to propose him to-night." ...|$|R
60|$|I. The man was melancholy, and oppressed {{with the}} {{thoughts}} of his declining circumstances, and yet had not any thought of letting his wife know it, whose way of living was high and expensive, and {{more than he could}} support; but though it must have ended in ruin, he would rather let it have gone on <b>till</b> she was <b>surprised</b> in it, than to tell her the danger that was before her.|$|R
60|$|Tom would fain {{have been}} on his feet, yet the support of that {{shoulder}} was inexpressibly comfortable to his aching temples, {{and he could not}} but wait for the shock of being roughly shaken and put down. So, as his brother related what had occurred, he crouched and trembled more and more on his father's breast, <b>till,</b> to his <b>surprise,</b> he found the other arm passed round him in support, drawing him more tenderly close.|$|R
60|$|Another turn {{brought us}} into a fresh nook of Paradise; and this time to one still undefiled. We hurried down a narrow grass path, the Cannes de Riviere and the Balisiers {{brushing}} our heads as we passed; while round us danced brilliant butterflies, bright orange, sulphur- yellow, black and crimson, black and lilac, {{and half a dozen}} hues more, <b>till</b> we stopped, <b>surprised</b> and delighted. For beneath us lay the sea, seen through a narrow gap of richest verdure.|$|R
60|$|Long {{they argued}} and bargained, <b>till</b> each was <b>surprised</b> at the obstinacy of the other. They ended, however, by {{splitting}} the difference, {{and it was}} agreed, that Lord Cashel was at once to hand over thirty thousand pounds, and to take his son's bond for the amount; that the other debts were to stand over till Fanny's money was forthcoming; and that the income of the newly married pair was to be seven thousand five hundred a-year.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] and Mrs. Minot {{looked much}} <b>surprised,</b> <b>till</b> Jack {{pointed to the}} screen, and, making a sad face to express Jill's anguish, {{answered}} in a cheerful tone, [...] "Well, I'm {{not sure that it}} is best. Doctor did not want me to go, but said I might because I teased. I shall be sure to come to grief, and then every one will say, 'I told you so,' and that is so provoking. I'd rather keep still a week longer. Hadn't I better?" ...|$|R
60|$|I had {{not been}} many hours on board, <b>till</b> I was <b>surprised</b> with the firing of three muskets from the shore; we {{wondered}} {{what could be the}} meaning of it, knowing that it was an unusual thing in that place, where we knew the natives of the country had no fire-arms; so we could not tell what to make of it, and therefore took no notice, other than, as I say, to wonder at it. About half-an-hour after, we heard three muskets more, and still, not knowing anything of the matter, we made them no return to the signal. Some time after three muskets were fired again, but still we took no notice, for we knew nothing of what return was to be made to it.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's Marilla {{getting home}} from the funeral," [...] {{she said to her}} husband, who was lying on the kitchen lounge. Thomas Lynde lay more on the lounge {{nowadays}} than he had been used to do, but Mrs. Rachel, who was so sharp at noticing anything beyond her own household, had not as yet noticed this. [...] "And she's got the twins with her, [...] . yes, there's Davy leaning over the dashboard grabbing at the pony's tail and Marilla jerking him back. Dora's sitting up on the seat as prim as you please. She always looks as if she'd just been starched and ironed. Well, poor Marilla is going to have her hands full this winter and no mistake. Still, I don't see that she could do anything less than take them, under the circumstances, and she'll have Anne to help her. Anne's tickled to death over the whole business, and she has a real knacky way with children, I must say. Dear me, it doesn't seem a day since poor Matthew brought Anne herself home and everybody laughed at the idea of Marilla bringing up a child. And now she has adopted twins. You're never safe from being <b>surprised</b> <b>till</b> you're dead." ...|$|R

The film was later dubbed and released in Telugu as D16 was released in March 2017, after plans to remake it was dropped..|$|R
40|$|Libro Llamado Arte de Taner Fantasía is {{the only}} one known and the most {{fundamental}} work of the spanish Black Friar Tomás de Santa María. This book published in Valladolid in 1565 is a considerable guide of the music mostly of the 16 th century and thanks to the collaboration of Tomás de Santa María with spanish composer Antonio de Cabezón is also a exellent textbook of interpretation of music from this Reneissance composer. The tractate <b>surprises</b> <b>till</b> nowadays with his orderliness and lucidity. It is not only a very good handbook for practise of organ music, composing, improvisation and accompaniment according the contemporary contrapuntal rules and instruments potency, but the tractate is still very recent, most in the parts treating hand positron, tone creation or rhythmical feeling as well. Santa María intervened in the history of fingering on the keyboard instruments as well. As the first one had menshioned the posibility of using the tumb on black bars a centruy before Carl Phillipe Emanuel Bach did so. Thanks to the edition af the department of musicology of the equivalent of the Czech Academy of Science and the publishing of the faksimile of this tractate the book is spread into the world for the general public and I decided of avail this opportunity and offer facts about the tractate, the basic literature wich deals with the book Arte de Taner Fantasía and try to approximate some of the Santa María´s ideas...|$|R
60|$|As soon as {{the ship}} was thus secured, the captain ordered seven guns to be fired, which was the signal agreed upon with me to give me notice of his success, which, you may be sure, I was very glad to hear, having sat {{watching}} upon the shore for it till near two o’clock in the morning. Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me down; and it having been a day of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound, <b>till</b> I was <b>surprised</b> with the noise of a gun; and presently starting up, I heard a man call me {{by the name of}} “Governor! Governor!” and presently I knew the captain’s voice; when, climbing {{up to the top of}} the hill, there he stood, and, pointing to the ship, he embraced me in his arms, “My dear friend and deliverer,” says he, “there’s your ship; for she is all yours, and so are we, and all that belong to her.” I cast my eyes to the ship, and there she rode, within little more than half a mile of the shore; for they had weighed her anchor as {{soon as the}}y were masters of her, and, the weather being fair, had brought her to an anchor just against the mouth of the little creek; and the tide being up, the captain had brought the pinnace in near the place where I had first landed my rafts, and so landed just at my door. I was at first ready to sink down with the surprise; for I saw my deliverance, indeed, visibly put into my hands, all things easy, and a large ship just ready to carry me away whither I pleased to go. At first, for some time, I was not able to answer him one word; but as he had taken me in his arms I held fast by him, or I should have fallen to the ground. He perceived the surprise, and immediately pulled a bottle out of his pocket and gave me a dram of cordial, which he had brought on purpose for me. After I had drunk it, I sat down upon the ground; and though it brought me to myself, yet it was a good while before I could speak a word to him. All this time the poor man was in as great an ecstasy as I, only not under any surprise as I was; and he said a thousand kind and tender things to me, to compose and bring me to myself; but such was the flood of joy in my breast, that it put all my spirits into confusion: at last it broke out into tears, and in a little while after I recovered my speech; I then took my turn, and embraced him as my deliverer, and we rejoiced together. I told him I looked upon him as a man sent by Heaven to deliver me, and that the whole transaction seemed to be a chain of wonders; that such things as these were the testimonies we had of a secret hand of Providence governing the world, and an evidence that the eye of an infinite Power could search into the remotest corner of the world, and send help to the miserable whenever He pleased. I forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness to Heaven; and what heart could forbear to bless Him, who had not only in a miraculous manner provided for me in such a wilderness, and in such a desolate condition, but from whom every deliverance must always be acknowledged to proceed.|$|R
