40|$|Application of {{weathering}} and cold-formed {{steel in}} transmission lines can reduce steel consumption and environmental pollution. Some {{advances in the}} studies on the weathering and cold-formed steel in transmission tower are introduced. Firstly, corrosion-resistant tests of weathering steel samples under different simulating <b>technical</b> <b>atmospheres</b> were carried out separately for 240 hours. It shows that the corrosion degree of joint samples is {{higher than that of}} single chip samples, and the corrosion-resistant performance of weathering steel is superior to common carbon steel. The corrosion-resistance of weathering steel meets with the requirement of transmission tower. Secondly, experiments and finite element analysis for cold-formed angles and a 220 kV prototype tower were completed, and the stability coeffi-cient fitting curves as well as the modification formulas of slenderness ratio for cold-formed members were determined. According to the structural characteristics of transmission towers, four sections of cold-formed angles with different sections and slenderness ratios were selected in this study. The finite element model well predicted the buckling behav-iour of the cold-formed members. Ultimate loads calculating by the fitting curve were well agreed to the experimental values, especially for the members with small slenderness ratios. Weight of the cold-formed steel tower can be reduced by more than 5 percent after considering the strength enhancement. Cost of the weathering and cold-formed steel transmission tower is nearly equivalent to that of hot-rolled steel tower with hot galvanizing...|$|R

The theoretical knowledge finding its source within this framework follows two complementary directions: the first being a sensitive approach and the second a <b>technical</b> approach. <b>Atmosphere</b> does indeed come within a spatial experience, but the physical phenomena it is made up of, take into account specific knowledge and know-how such as lighting, thermal physics, acoustics, etc…(2) The study presented here is a part of a PhD work of which the aim is to qualify the atmosphere representation produced by architects during the different conception stages. We suggest a reflection on conception methodology so that the initially suggest atmosphere lasts all along the conception process and in the lived spaces. In this paper, we are more particularly interested here {{in the manner in which}} atmosphere is represented by the architect during the conceptual phase. An architect must indeed produce images to give shape to his project and to communicate it. The question will be asked about the capacity of pictures to translate atmosphere intentions. Two different buildings, whose respective architects had foreseen their atmospheric intentions, before the designing stage, will help us in our study. This way, we will analyze the reasons which motivated the building designer’s choices in the production of atmosphere representations: how does the architect get to suggest feelings through image? What tools and modes of representation does he mostly use...|$|R

40|$|Hans-Georg Gadamer é bem conhecido por sua abordagem compreensivista quanto aos problemas tradicionais da metafísica e filosofia em geral. Seu posicionamento teórico e crítico aproximam sua obra da tradição compreensivista iniciada em fins do século XIX e levada adiante a partir do início do século XX. Nesse trabalho, proponho uma breve discussão acerca de uma de suas comunicações nos anos 1960 em que o autor procura refletir e elucidar a situação da filosofia naquele contexto específico. Fim da Segunda Guerra Mundial, industrialização endêmica e o progresso vertiginoso da técnica e da ciência podem ser apontados como fatores decisivos para a compreensão das características políticas, sociais e econômicas daquela época em particular. Intitulando sua comunicação “A posição da filosofia na sociedade”, Gadamer defende uma postura radicalmente diferente daqueles que se aproximam de visões de mundo totalizantes que poderiam ser justificadas a partir do ponto de vista da tradição hegeliana e, por outro lado, da postura subserviente, acrítica e iludida do que o autor chama de “philosophy of science”, herança da tradição positivista. Mesmo apresentados tendo-se em mente os problemas específicos daquele contexto, os argumentos de Gadamer podem ser utilizados como uma ferramenta razoável para a compreensão de nossos próprios problemas, especialmente quando a tarefa é {{discutir}} e compreender criticamente a posição da Filosofia em nossa cultura. Procuro refletir sobre essa comunicação de Gadamer ajustando o foco para a relevância dele para a compreensão da situação da Filosofia no contexto cultural e acadêmico brasileiro. Abstract: Hans-Georg Gadamer is {{well known}} for his comprehensive approach towards philosophical and metaphysical traditional problems. His theoretical and critical attitude sets his work near to the tradition started {{by the end of the}} nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth. I propose to briefly discuss one of his communications in the 1960 ’s in which he tries to explore and elucidate the situation of philosophy within that particular context. End of World War II, endemic industrialization, mass culture and vertiginous progress of technic and science may count as decisive factors to understand the social, scientific and economic characteristics of the occidental culture of that time. Calling his communication “The situation of philosophy within society”, Gadamer defends a different posture for those who advocates for totalizing world visions, as the Hegelian tradition could endorse, and the subservient unreflective and delusional behavior which he notices in what he calls “philosophy of science”. Even wrote and addressed having in mind that particular historical context, Gadamer arguments’ could be read in our days, beginnings of the twentieth first century, as a valid tool to think our own context and problems, especially when the task is to understand the value of philosophical reflection within the scientific and <b>technical</b> <b>atmosphere</b> of our own times. I try to explore his arguments at that occasion with the focus adjusted to the relevance of this reading in order to rethink philosophy’s position in the academic and social Brazilian context...|$|E
40|$|Setup of Mössbauer spectrometers (MS) for structural, phase, and {{magnetic}} characterization of iron- or tin-containing samples is presented. This comprehensive line of 57 Fe and 119 Sn Mössbauer spectrometers covers transmission spectrometers (TMS) for room temperature (RT) measurements, temperature dependent measurements and measurements in an external magnetic field. An RT Conversion Electron/Conversion X-ray Mössbauer technique (CEMS/CXMS) is also available. The main {{concept of the}} RT MS is a table-top spectrometric bench with a control unit based on special-purpose hardware or standard PC platform. The first way offers a compact design and PC independent spectra collection system. The second setup, a PC-based system, which uses commercial devices and LabVIEW software, offers easy customization and enables advancement in spectrometer construction. The both types of control systems are able to operate special parts (velocity transducers, gamma-ray detectors) of unusual spectrometric benches. The standard velocity axis range is up to ± 20 mm/s with a maximum nonlinearity of 0. 1 %. Applicable measuring conditions of presented TMSs cover a cryogenic temperature range from 1. 5 up to 300 K and high temperature range from RT up to 1000 C. With in-field low-temperature MS, {{we are able to}} analyze samples normally in the external magnetic fields up to 8 T (in temperature interval from 1. 5 up to 300 K). In addition, special modes of measurements can be applied including backscattering gamma-ray geometry or measurement in an inert or controlled-humidity <b>atmosphere.</b> <b>Technical</b> details and construction aspects of spectrometers are presented...|$|R
5000|$|The concerto has {{received}} a positive response from music critics. Reviewing the world premiere, Ivan Hewett of The Daily Telegraph compared the work favorably to Lindberg's Violin Concerto No. 1, saying [...] "it {{proved to be a}} bigger-boned, more expansive utterance than his first." [...] He added, [...] "As for the new concerto, it reminded us why Lindberg is the go-to composer for many orchestras in search of a user-friendly premiere. It gave an agreeable sense that modernist abstraction doesn't have to be penitentially austere, in fact it can be made to sound positively gorgeous." [...] Richard Fairman of the Financial Times wrote: His new violin concerto unfolds with a massive, expansive feel to it, like the soundtrack to some epic Scandinavian film noir. Musical theorists will be pleased to note that {{a large proportion of the}} score is derived from a three-chord progression played by the violin at the outset, so there is no lack of <b>technical</b> discipline. The <b>atmosphere,</b> though, is brooding. From time to time soloist Frank Peter Zimmermann laboured over passages full of notes that do not seem to be going anywhere — but each time the concerto gets to its next destination, a panoramic vista opens up of dark clouds over forests and lakes, of repressed passions and baleful desires. Perhaps there is a film composer inside Lindberg struggling to get out. Reviewing the New York City premiere, James R. Oestreich of The New York Times similarly observed, [...] "The work, in three continuous movements interrupted only by an extended cadenza, is big and attractive, deeply satisfying in its proportions and contours." [...] Sean Piccoli of the New York Classical Review was more critical of the piece, however, remarking, [...] "The concerto is an attractive set piece for reconciling Respighi's love of orderly harmony within Stravinksy's search for beauty in chaos. How it fared strictly on its own terms, as a standalone work of three movements including a fiery cadenza, was less certain." ...|$|R
40|$|The ongoing {{developments}} in the combustion engine technology demand the reduction of piston weight and the simultaneous increase in the specific strength of the cast metal structure. The reduction of the oxygen concentration in the casting mold atmosphere has a theoretical potential to allow the realization of thin-walled castings and a parallel reduction of defect density, which are both cornerstones of the ongoing developments. In this study it was investigated {{to what extent the}} oxidation of aluminum melt can be suppressed via inert gas flush of the mold and how this practice affects the mold filling procedure. Furthermore it was investigated how the positive effects of the inert gas casting could be fortified by the introduction of novel completive measures. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the inert gas flooding of the mold cavity, firstly the casting properties of the used aluminum piston alloy were determined under air and <b>technical</b> shielding gas <b>atmospheres.</b> The results indicate that the obtained reduction of the oxidation rate does enhance the fluidity, however the improvements seem to be concentrated to the liquid flow state. After the conditions have been clarified, the practical work began with the design and validation of the for inert gas casting dedicated gating system. The preset criteria were fulfilled after six development stages, wherewith the conditions {{for the start of the}} actual test matrix have been cleared. The basis of valuation of the casting trials was represented by the results of a dye penetrant inspection, which showed to be precise in identifying the for the topic important cold shut and oxide defects. This accuracy was proved by validation tests with CT and metallographic sections. The first results obtained show that using the inert gas flooding of the mold, the formation of cold shuts and by surface flooding induced oxides can be effectively avoided. As disadvantageous result of the inert gas flooding small sized oxides were identified, which are verisimilar products of the increased surface turbulences caused by the reduced thickness of the superficial oxide layer. The castability of thin walled piston sections could be further improved by setting a structured mold surface (waffle pattern), which potently counteracted cold shuts regardless of the casting atmosphere composition. A similar effect was anticipated from the use of fluorine-containing coating additives, however according the results such coatings could be regarded as ineffective in capturing the oxide mantle of the Al-melt. The critical role of the running system on the casting quality and robustness of the casting process was demonstrated by comparing the new, for inert gas casting designed geometry with a conventional alternative. The comparison of two fiber filter types confirmed the importance of the applied pressure loss in setting the flow conditions. Particularly in case of oversized gating systems the finer mesh filter can help to calm the flow and thus to suppress turbulences. The for inert gas casting designed gating system has been able to meet the expectations by securing a reproducible control over the mold filling procedure. The resulted reduction of the velocity and thus the kinetic energy of the flow, however increased the susceptibility to cold shuts. According to the results is therefore always a compromise in the choice of flow conditions (turbulences vs. cold shuts) required. The test results are suggestive of characteristic defects. The conventional geometry favored the formation of larger oxides, whereas in the novel geometry typically that of finer oxides. To determine the characteristic peculiarities of the oxide defects and the alleged causes, the found oxides were investigated and categorized by using electron microscopy and micrographs. In addition, the effect of the categorized oxide types on the formation of second phases in the piston microstructure was studied. The won results could be used as the cornerstone of a future defect catalogue for oxides in aluminum castings. In the last part of the work, the effect of surface phenomena on the mold filling simulations has been studied. Basis of all conducted simulations were values of the “surface parameter” measured using the pendant drop method. The newly introduced attribute surface parameter represents the sum of the surface tension and the strength of the oxide layer and was measured under air and <b>technical</b> inert gas <b>atmospheres</b> at varied temperatures. By using the latest {{developments in}} the simulation programs and considering the surface parameter of the melt, a strong convergence between simulations and reality could be achieved. For further improvement of the accuracy of future casting simulations, the optimized consideration of the surface oxidation procedure seems vital. Thus the author recommends the concentration of the research work on this subject...|$|R
