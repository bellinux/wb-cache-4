25|$|According to {{numerous}} reports, Yeltsin was alcohol dependent. The subject made headlines abroad during Yeltsin's {{visit to the}} U.S. in 1989 {{for a series of}} lectures on social and political life in the Soviet Union. That trip was described by a report in the Italian newspaper La Repubblica. The article, reprinted by Pravda, reported <b>that</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> often appeared drunk in public. His alleged alcoholism was also the subject of media discussion following his meeting with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott following Clinton's inauguration in 1993 and an incident during a flight stop-over at Shannon Airport, Ireland, in September 1994 when the waiting Irish Taoiseach (prime minister) Albert Reynolds was told <b>that</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> was unwell and would not be leaving the aircraft. Reynolds tried to make excuses for him in an effort to offset his own humiliation in vainly waiting outside the plane to meet him. Speaking to the media in March 2010, Yeltsin's daughter Tatyana Yumasheva claimed that her father had suffered a heart attack on the flight from the United States to Moscow and was therefore {{not in a position to}} leave the plane.|$|E
25|$|Rutskoy called Yeltsin's move a {{step toward}} a coup d'etat. The next day, the Constitutional Court held <b>that</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> had {{violated}} the constitution and could be impeached. During an all-night session, chaired by Khasbulatov, parliament declared the president's decree null and void. Rutskoy was proclaimed president and took the oath on the constitution. He dismissed Yeltsin and the key ministers Pavel Grachev (defense), Nikolay Golushko (security), and Viktor Yerin (interior). Russia now had two presidents and two ministers of defense, security, and interior. It was dual power in earnest. Although Gennady Zyuganov and other top leaders of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation {{did not participate in}} the events, individual members of communist organizations actively supported the parliament.|$|E
25|$|In July, the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation {{confirmed}} {{the election of}} Pyotr Sumin to head {{the administration of the}} Chelyabinsk oblast, something <b>that</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> had refused to accept. As a result, a situation of dual power existed in that region from July to October in 1993, with two administrations claiming legitimacy simultaneously. Another conflict involved the decision of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation regarding the regional presidency in Mordovia. The court delegated the question of legality of abolishing the post of the region's president to the Constitutional Court of Mordovia. As a result, popularly elected President , member of the pro-Yeltsin Democratic Russia movement, lost his position. Thereafter, the state news agency (ITAR-TASS) ceased to report on a number of Constitutional Court decisions.|$|E

5000|$|Grigory Yavlinsky was {{the liberal}} {{alternative}} to Yeltsin and Zyuganov. He appealed to a well-educated middle class <b>that</b> saw <b>Yeltsin</b> as an incompetent alcoholic and Zyuganov as a Soviet-era throwback. Seeing Yavlinsky as a threat, Yeltsin's {{inner circle of}} supporters worked to bifurcate political discourse, thus excluding a middle ground—and convince voters <b>that</b> only <b>Yeltsin</b> could defeat the Communist [...] "menace." [...] The election became a two-man race, and Zyuganov, who lacked Yeltsin's resources and financial backing, watched haplessly as his strong initial lead was whittled away.|$|R

25|$|In February 1996, Yeltsin {{announced}} that he would seek a second term in the summer 1996 Russian presidential election. The announcement followed weeks of speculation <b>that</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> {{was at the end of}} his political career because of his health problems and growing unpopularity in Russia. At the time Yeltsin was recuperating from a series of heart attacks. Domestic and international observers also noted his occasionally erratic behaviour. When campaigning opened in early 1996, Yeltsin's popularity was close to zero. Meanwhile, the opposition Communist Party had already gained ground in parliamentary voting on 17 December 1995, and its candidate, Gennady Zyuganov, had a strong grass roots organization, especially in the rural areas and small towns, and appealed effectively to memories of the old days of Soviet prestige on the international stage and the socialist domestic order.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{researchers}} {{have criticized the}} theory, stating {{that it is a}} conspiracy theory. The researchers pointed out that the theory's proponents have provided little or no evidence to support the theory. Gordon Bennett points out that the decision to send troops to Chechnya was taken by Boris Yeltsin – not Vladimir Putin – with the wholehearted support of all power structures after the Invasion of Dagestan. While Yeltsin may have made the decision to invade Chechnya, it was Putin who gave the order to invade. According to John Dunlop, on the same day <b>that</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> appointed Putin as acting premier, Putin chaired a meeting of the Security Council. In his memoirs, Yeltsin wrote of this meeting: ...|$|E
2500|$|After his firing, {{there was}} some {{indication}} that General Lebed intended {{to run for the}} presidency again in the 2000 Russian presidential election. His visit to the United States in January 1997 was viewed as an effort to win over American business interests as the best successor to Yeltsin, and included a meeting with Donald J. Trump at Trump Tower. Reportedly, he discussed potential construction projects in Moscow that Trump could be involved in. [...] "He invited me to Russia and I accepted, I thought he was terrific," [...] Trump said after the meeting. One Western analyst stated about Lebed, [...] "He may perceive <b>that</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> benefited greatly from support from the Americans in the last campaign. Bill Clinton made a trip to Moscow during the campaign. And the International Monetary Fund extended loans that enabled the Government to make credible promises to pay wages." [...] He also visited President Clinton's inauguration while he was there, at the invitation of Senator William Roth, who made the request at the behest of an unknown businessman. Overall Lebed was said to have left a good impression on the American businessmen that he met. During that time, he was described as being the most popular candidate for the Russian presidency.|$|E
2500|$|After {{catching}} {{public attention}} with his actions in Moldova in 1992, the general {{came to be}} perceived as being an honest, anti-establishment patriot who stood against government corruption and wanted to restore order. Lebed was not necessarily in favor of democracy and had a mixed opinion of it, but did praise both Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet—saying that Pinochet was able to revive Chile by [...] "putting the army in first place" [...] because [...] "preserving the army is the basis for preserving the government"—and the French leader Charles de Gaulle. General Lebed ended up joining the centrist, nationalistic political movement known as the Congress of Russian Communities. He retired from the army in 1995 in order to enter politics and won a State Duma seat in December of that year. He came to be presented as a [...] "law and order" [...] candidate promising to curb both street crime and government corruption, as well as also promising to end the unpopular First Chechen War that had been started by President Yeltsin in 1994. For economic policy he hinted that he supported market reforms that were ongoing at the time, but remained deliberately vague. Due to his populist approach he was compared to Vladimir Zhirinovsky, but lacking the latter's aggressive nationalism. Lebed's style and personal charisma were considered to have been more important to his campaign than his political message itself. Out of the three main contenders for the Russian presidency in 1996 (Yeltsin and Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov), Lebed was regarded as having run the most successful campaign, despite the extensive advantages <b>that</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> enjoyed over his rivals.|$|E
5000|$|In 1999, Yeltsin {{appointed}} Vladimir Putin as the Prime Minister. Later in <b>that</b> year, <b>Yeltsin</b> {{resigned from}} the presidency and Putin took over. In 2000 Putin won the presidential election. This is when Putin started centralizing power and becoming authoritative.|$|R
25|$|He wrote <b>that</b> Mr. <b>Yeltsin</b> added, “I {{think we}} have {{committed}} a crime against our people by making {{their standard of living}} so incomparably lower than that of the Americans.” An aide, Lev Sukhanov was reported to have said that it was at that moment that “the last vestige of Bolshevism collapsed” inside his boss.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the coup}} rapidly {{collapsed}} and Gorbachev returned to Moscow, it was Boris Yeltsin {{who had played}} {{a leading role in the}} street resistance to that Committee, and the incident marked a shift of power away from Gorbachev toward Yeltsin. By the end of <b>that</b> year, <b>Yeltsin</b> was the leader of Russia, and the Soviet Union was no more.|$|R

50|$|In September 1994 Reynolds {{was left}} {{standing}} on the tarmac at Shannon Airport by Russian president Boris Yeltsin, who failed to emerge from his plane to meet awaiting Irish dignatories. Headlines around the world alleged <b>that</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> was too drunk to appear; a Russian official said that the President was unwell. Yeltsin later {{announced that he had}} overslept.|$|E
50|$|On 28 October 1992 Yeltsin {{declared}} the FNS as unconstitutional, effectively making the group {{the first to}} be outlawed since the collapse of communism. Konstantinov however argued <b>that</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> had overstepped his authority in doing so and stated that only a court could make such a pronouncement. The case was taken to the Constitutional Court, which overturned the ban on 12 February 1993.|$|E
5000|$|As of [...] , {{there is}} only one living former {{president}} (if you except Vladimir Putin, who was president from 2000 to 2008, and became president again in 2012). The most recent death of a former president was <b>that</b> of Boris <b>Yeltsin</b> (1991-1999) on April 23, 2007, aged 76.|$|R
50|$|Some sets <b>that</b> include <b>Yeltsin</b> {{preceding}} Gorbachev {{were made}} during the brief period between the establishment of President of the RSFSR {{and the collapse of}} the Soviet Union, as both Yeltsin and Gorbachev were concurrently in prominent government positions. During Medvedev's presidency, Medvedev and Putin may both share the largest doll due to Putin still having a prominent role in the government as Prime Minister of Russia. As of Putin's re-election as the 4th President of Russia, Medvedev will usually succeed Yeltsin and preceded Putin in stacking order, due to Putin's role solely as the largest doll.|$|R
50|$|In May 1992, President of Russia Boris Yeltsin {{appointed}} General of the Army Pavel Grachev to {{the post}} of Minister of Defence. Grachev's decision to side with Yeltsin in the Russian constitutional crisis of 1993, when the president called up tanks to shell the Russian White House to blast his opponents out of parliament, effectively deprived the Supreme Soviet of Russia of its nominal an opportunity to overturn the president's authority. At least partly for <b>that</b> reason, <b>Yeltsin</b> retained his defence minister despite intense criticism of Grachev's management of the First Chechen War and the Russian military establishment in general. Finally, Yeltsin's victory {{in the first round}} of the 1996 Russian presidential election spurred Yeltsin to dismiss Grachev.|$|R
50|$|The first {{speech was}} made by the Chairman of the Central Election Commission of Russia Nikolai Ryabov, in his speech he congratulated Boris Yeltsin, {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> was popularly re-elected President of Russia for a second term and he declared that the elections were fair and democratic. At the end of the speech Ryabov gave Yeltsin a certificate of the Russian President.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} alleged <b>that</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> {{may not have}} legitimately won the 1996 presidential election, but instead {{employed}} electoral fraud. Some results, largely from Russia's ethnic republics of Tatarstan, Dagestan and Bashkortostan, showed highly unlikely changes in voting patterns between the two rounds of voting. [...] However, these results are unlikely {{to have had a}} material effect on the outcome.|$|E
5000|$|Volkogonov co-chaired a U.S.-Russia Joint Commission on Prisoners of War, [...] "and continued, always, to write." [...] Volkogonov {{fell out}} of favor with Yeltsin in 1994, after {{opposing}} {{the use of force}} to solve ethnic disputes within areas of the former Soviet Union. Specifically, Volkogonov felt <b>that</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> was taking [...] "the advice of wrong-headed counselors" [...] in deciding to invade Chechnya.|$|E
2500|$|The {{continuation}} of Chechen independence {{was seen as}} reducing Moscow's authority; Chechnya became perceived as a haven for criminals, and a hard-line group within the Kremlin began advocating war. A Security Council meeting was held 29 November 1994, where Yeltsin ordered the Chechens to disarm, or else Moscow would restore order. Defense Minister Pavel Grachev assured <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>that</b> he would [...] "take Grozny with one airborne assault regiment in two hours." ...|$|R
50|$|Running {{up to the}} 1996 Presidential election, {{there were}} serious doubts <b>that</b> President Boris <b>Yeltsin</b> would allow {{elections}} to take place. On 5 May 1996, Korzhakov explicitly called for postponing the elections. However, the elections took place as planned and Yeltsin finished first in the 16 June 1996, initial round of the Presidential elections with about 35% of the vote, scheduled to compete with Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov in the runoff on 3 July 1996.|$|R
25|$|Abramovich was {{the first}} person to {{originally}} recommend to <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>that</b> Vladimir Putin be his successor as the Russian president. When Putin formed his first cabinet as Prime Minister in 1999, Abramovich interviewed each of the candidates for cabinet positions before they were approved. Subsequently, Abramovich would remain one of Putin's closest confidants. In 2007 Putin consulted in meetings with Abramovich on the question of who should be his successor as president; Medvedev was personally recommended by Abramovich.|$|R
5000|$|At 12:30 an {{aircraft}} bearing the Russian's advance party landed at Shannon. The official delegation, including Reynolds, the Russian ambassador to Ireland, Nikolai Kozyrev, Bertie Ahern (the Minister for Finance), Brian Cowen (the Minister for Energy), and Willie O'Dea (Minister of State) {{went to the}} runway to greet Yeltsin's plane which was expected ten minutes later. The assembled dignitaries waited but Yeltsin's plane did not land. Airport officials reported that it was circling over Shannon and County Clare. [...] After circling for an hour the plane landed. However, Yeltsin did not appear when the plane's door opened. An Aeroflot official informed Kozyrev <b>that</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> was unwell and that the vice premier, Oleg Soskovets, would meet with the Irish delegation. Kozyrev was able to board the plane {{but was unable to}} see Yeltsin. Alexander Korzhakov, Yeltsin's bodyguard, told Kozyrev <b>that</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> was [...] "very tired." [...] Kozyrev returned to the runway and informed Reynolds <b>that</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> would not be making an appearance due to poor health. Reynolds replied, [...] "Well now, if he is sick, there is {{nothing we can do about}} it. I am willing to talk to the Russian President's representative, but Mr. Yeltsin, my guest, is on Irish soil, and I cannot miss the opportunity to go on board the airplane for five minutes, shake the president's hand and wish him a speedy recovery." [...] The Russians rejected this suggestion. Reynolds then agreed to meet Soskovets and gave orders for a meeting to be held in the airport. The Irish government commandeered the VIP lounge of Delta Air Lines to serve as the venue. Reynolds and Soskovets held a brief meeting and Yeltsin's plane departed immediately after it concluded.|$|E
50|$|Boris Yeltsin ran for {{the post}} of Chairman as a CPSU member twice unsuccessfully, gaining 497 and 503 votes respectively, out of 531 {{required}} to be elected. The CPSU then nominated a more moderate candidate, the President of the Council of Ministers, Alexander Vlasov. President of USSR Mikhail Gorbachev publicly spoke out against Yeltsin at the Congress session. After <b>that,</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> ran again on 29 May 1990 and gained 535 votes (50.52%), consequently becoming the leader of Russian SFSR.|$|E

50|$|On July 6, 1995, {{after the}} Budyonnovsk hostage crisis, he succeeded Viktor Yerin as Interior Minister of Russia. In August 1996 Alexander Lebed, {{who had just}} been {{appointed}} Secretary of the Security Council of Russia, blamed Kulikov for the disastrous Battle of Grozny and requested <b>that</b> President Boris <b>Yeltsin</b> sack him. However, Yeltsin declined his request and in October fired Lebed from his position. Eventually, Kulikov was dismissed in March 1998 along with the entire second cabinet of Viktor Chernomyrdin.|$|R
5000|$|In 1998, Duma deputy Aleksandr Salii {{asked the}} office of the Russian Prosecutor-General to {{investigate}} claims that a double had been impersonating Yeltsin for official purposes since the real Yeltsin's heart surgery in November 1996. Salii told journalists that he and colleagues had examined some 1,500 photographs and gathered evidence showing that a [...] "New Yeltsin" [...] had appeared after 1996, with the supposed decoy frequently displaying his injured hand, whereas the real Yeltsin had always tried to conceal <b>that</b> hand. <b>Yeltsin</b> had frequently disappeared from public view in preceding years, sometimes in circumstances that aroused widespread suspicion. In July 1995, Yeltsin disappeared from public view for weeks following a heart operation. A photograph of Yeltsin was released to dispel rumours about his health, which actually inflamed the situation when it emerged that it appeared to be a staged photograph based on a photograph taken some months earlier.|$|R
50|$|Because the Federation Council {{initially}} {{included many}} regional administrators appointed by <b>Yeltsin,</b> <b>that</b> body often supported {{the president and}} objected to bills approved by the State Duma, which had more anti-Yeltsin deputies. The power of the upper house to consider bills passed by the lower chamber resulted in its disapproval of about one-half of such bills, necessitating concessions by the State Duma or votes to override upper-chamber objections. In February 1996, {{the heads of the}} two chambers pledged to try to break this habit, but wrangling appeared to intensify in the months that followed.|$|R
