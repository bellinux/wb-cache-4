5|$|Casualties {{amongst the}} 49th Battalion are {{listed on the}} Australian War Memorial as 97 killed and 111 wounded, the {{majority}} of which were suffered during the fighting around Sanananda. Author Fred Cranston, who served with the 49th Battalion during the New Guinea campaign, disagrees with these figures, listing the 49th Battalion's casualties during the fighting around Sanananda as 14 officers and 282 other ranks killed or wounded, and 313 all ranks evacuated sick. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: one DSO, three MCs, one DCM, three MMs and 10 MIDs.

5|$|The {{decision}} {{to found a}} national organization was likely the result of several factors. First, the mainstream trade unions were increasingly reformist and centralized. Second, the localists gained confidence from <b>their</b> <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> the dock workers' strike in Hamburg in late 1896 and early 1897. Third, loss of membership (for example, the Berlin metal workers rejoined the DMV in 1897) convinced the localists {{of the need for}} action.|$|E

5|$|The {{massacre}} at Kraljevo, {{as well as}} a similar and nearly concurrent massacre in nearby Kragujevac, convinced German commanders that mass killings of Serbian hostages were not only ineffectual but also counterproductive, as they drove locals into the hands of insurgents and sometimes resulted in the deaths of factory workers contributing to the German war effort. Following the war, several senior German military officials were tried and convicted for <b>their</b> <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> the reprisal shootings at the Nuremberg Trials and the Subsequent Nuremberg trials.|$|E

5|$|After Byzantium, the Spartans were {{allegedly}} {{eager to}} end <b>their</b> <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> the war. The Spartans were supposedly {{of the view}} that, with the liberation of mainland Greece and the Greek cities of Asia Minor, the war's purpose had already been reached. There was also perhaps a feeling that securing long-term security for the Asian Greeks would prove impossible. In the aftermath of Mycale, the Spartan king Leotychides had proposed transplanting all the Greeks from Asia Minor to Europe as the only method of permanently freeing them from Persian dominion. Xanthippus, the Athenian commander at Mycale, had furiously rejected this; the Ionian cities were originally Athenian colonies, and the Athenians, if no-one else, would protect the Ionians. This marks {{the point at which}} the leadership of the Greek Alliance effectively passed to the Athenians. With the Spartan withdrawal after Byzantium, the leadership of the Athenians became explicit.|$|E
