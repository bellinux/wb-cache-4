One of his first paid positions was as Inspector of Customs, for which he earned <b>three</b> <b>dollars</b> per day. Later, President Polk appointed him Collector of Customs. Before his marriage, he joined the Army and {{took part in the}} Seminole War, 1835–1837. He also was elected judge for Monroe County for the years 1837–1845.|$|E
5|$|Woods {{decided the}} jury for the Broadway run would employ some jury service {{rules of the}} New York courts. One such rule was the payment of jurors <b>three</b> <b>dollars</b> per day for their participation, which meant the {{selected}} audience members profited by at least 25 cents after subtracting the ticket price. Another was that only men could serve on a jury, although Woods made exceptions, for example at the performance Keller attended. He later loosened the rule to allow women jurors at matinee performances twice a week. Unlike a normal criminal trial, verdicts required only a majority vote rather than unanimity.|$|E
5|$|As Minton grew older, he was {{frequently}} {{in trouble with}} the people in his neighborhood. In 1904, he was arrested for disregarding a town ordinance forbidding bicyclists to ride on the sidewalk. He was taken before a justice of the peace and fined <b>three</b> <b>dollars,</b> an incident he later credited with changing his outlook on life and sparking his desire to become a lawyer. To accomplish that goal, and continue supporting his family, he traveled with his older brother Herbert to Fort Worth, Texas, to take a job at the Swift and Company meat packing plant. His father and younger siblings soon joined him in Texas after the two brothers' income was able to cover their expenses. After saving enough money to help establish the family in a new home, Minton returned to Indiana to attend high school, leaving his family in Texas.|$|E

5|$|Banks {{was born}} in Dallas, Texas, to Eddie and Essie Banks on January 31, 1931; he was the second of twelve children. His father, who had worked in {{construction}} and was a warehouse loader for a grocery chain, played baseball for black, semi-professional teams in Texas. As a child, Banks was not very interested in baseball, preferring swimming, basketball and football. His father bought him a baseball glove for less than <b>three</b> <b>dollars</b> at a five and dime store and motivated him with nickels and dimes to play catch. His mother encouraged him to follow one of his grandfathers into {{a career as a}} minister.|$|E
5|$|Born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on September 30, 1935, James Charles Taylor had two paper {{routes to}} help his widowed mother make ends meet. He {{delivered}} the morning and afternoon routes by bicycle for <b>three</b> <b>dollars</b> a week, which helped to develop his leg muscles. Though he did not play football until his junior year, he was a star athlete in four sports at Baton Rouge High School, and graduated in 1954. He stayed in town and played college football at Louisiana State University for coach Paul Dietzel's LSU Tigers football team. Taylor played on LSU's freshman team in 1954, but due to struggles in the classroom, he transferred to Hinds Community College in Raymond, Mississippi as a sophomore, where he met his future wife Dixie Grant. He then returned to LSU as a junior.|$|E
5|$|Other {{attempts}} to start rival leagues {{have been far}} less successful. The World Football League (WFL) played for two seasons, in 1974 and 1975, but faced monetary issues so severe that the league could not pay its players. In its second and final season the WFL attempted to establish a stable credit rating, but the league disbanded before its second season could be completed. The United States Football League (USFL) operated for three seasons from 1983 to 1985 but collapsed due to poor business decisions and monetary problems. A subsequent USD $1.5billion antitrust lawsuit against the NFL was successful in court, but the league was awarded only <b>three</b> <b>dollars</b> in damages. The XFL was created in 2001 by Vince McMahon and lasted for only one season. Despite television contracts with NBC and UPN and high expectations, the XFL suffered from poor television ratings and a low quality of play. The United Football League (UFL) began in 2009, but folded after suspending its 2012 season, due to financial issues.|$|E

25|$|The dollar {{replaced}} the pound {{at a rate}} of 1 dollar = 7 shillings in 1966, 7 years before independence. This rate allowed the establishment of parity with the U.S. dollar, due to the sterling/dollar rate then being fixed at £1 = $2.80. To aid in decimalization, three-dollar bills and fifteen-cent coins were created, as <b>three</b> <b>dollars</b> was roughly equivalent to one pound, and fifteen cents to a shilling, at the time of transition.|$|E

25|$|Representatives of the Cloud City Miners' Union (CCMU), Local 33 of the Western Federation of Miners, {{asked for}} a wage {{increase}} of fifty cents per day for all mine workers not already making <b>three</b> <b>dollars</b> per day. The union felt justified, for fifty cents a day had been cut from the miners' wages during the depression of 1893. Negotiations broke down and 968 miners walked out. Mine owners, who had formed a Mine Owners' Association with a secret anti-union agreement, locked out another 1,332 mine workers.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} highly {{profitable}} aspects of the Royal Canadian Mint’s enterprise is in its Numismatic product line. The euphoria surrounding the year 2000 led to the birth of the Millennium 25-cent coin program. The numismatic line included proof quality coins sold individually or as a complete set. This level of excess would come to signify the coming decade. The number of numismatic releases would increase on an annual basis starting in 2003. Numismatic three cents, five cents, and ten cents would be introduced, along with numismatic <b>three</b> <b>dollars</b> and eight dollars. Luxury coins would not be immune to the dramatic increases that ensued. Coins with face values of 250, 300 and 350 dollars would be introduced by 2006.|$|E
25|$|Violence {{occurred}} in later strikes as well. At Cripple Creek, Colorado, after mine owners increased the working day from eight hours to ten, miners dynamited mine buildings and equipment. The county sheriff hired thousands of armed deputies, and then {{lost control of}} them. This 1894 struggle {{was one of the}} few strikes in which a state militia was called out to protect striking miners from an armed group supporting mine owners. Further violence was averted by the owners' agreement to return to the eight-hour day and improve miners' pay to <b>three</b> <b>dollars</b> a day – the standard that the union fought for across the west from that point forward. That success enabled the WFM to expand dramatically over the next decade, to the point where it had over two hundred locals in thirteen states.|$|E

As of July 2010, with the company's nine stock splits, any IPO shares would be multiplied by 288; {{if one were to}} buy the IPO today given the splits and other factors, it would cost about 9cents. The stock price peaked in 1999 at around $119 ($60.928 adjusting for splits). The company began to offer a dividend on January 16, 2003, starting at eight cents per share for the fiscal year followed by a dividend of sixteen cents per share the subsequent year, switching from yearly to quarterly dividends in 2005 with eight cents a share per quarter and a special one-time payout of <b>three</b> <b>dollars</b> per share for the second quarter of the fiscal year.

500|$|Modern Life Is Rubbish was {{released}} in the United States by Blur's American record label SBK in December 1993—seven months after the album's UK release. This delay was because SBK's alternative-music department had closed down; Blur manager Chris Morrison later quipped, [...] "When I asked [...] why, {{they said it was}} because the girl had left." [...] Despite fears that Modern Lifes overt Englishness would be lost on the American market, SBK insisted on marketing the album to MOR stations and aimed for Top 40 airplay. The label largely ignored Morrison's arguments that Blur's best chance of exposure in America would be to court college radio-stations. SBK's strategy was to list the album at a developing-artist price (around <b>three</b> <b>dollars</b> less than standard), send the band on an intensive tour in 1994 and to target modern rock airplay with debut single [...] "Chemical World". The record company believed this would help expand on the base audience who bought Leisure, and eventually open Blur to Top 40 radio. Further, to lessen the anglocentric feel of the record, SBK added additional songs to the track-listing—including [...] "Popscene". The plan fared rather poorly, as Modern Life barely had any impact in the US; the album didn't chart on the US Billboard 200 and sold only 19,000 copies, a sharp decline compared to the 87,000 units that Leisure shifted.|$|E
