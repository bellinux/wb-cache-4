You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E

According to Heller, [...] "They are the only two ordinary soldiers mentioned by Caesar in his book, so the idea was to do a sort of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern take. I essentially took the seed of that idea to try to tell a big historical epic, but from the street level, the everyman's point of view." ...|$|E

For B-boys n'girls who come from {{the core of the}} hard, this is the hip-hop album you've been waiting for". Rolling Stones review was decidedly ambivalent, praising the album's sound, but noting that [...] "Wu-Tang... are more ciphers than masterful creations. In refusing to commodify themselves, they leave blank the ultimate canvas—the self." [...] Entertainment Weekly was more enthusiastic, giving the album an A, and writing that [...] "With its rumble jumble of drumbeats, peppered with occasional piano plunking, Enter has a raw, pass-the-mike flavor we haven't heard since rap was pop's best-kept secret." [...] Touré declared of the album, that [...] "This is hip-hop you won't find creeping up the Billboard charts but you will hear booming out of Jeep stereos in all the right neighborhoods." [...] However, Enter the Wu-Tang had surprising chart success, despite its raw, underground sound. It peaked at number 41 on the Billboard 200 chart and reached number eight on Billboards Top R/Hip Hop Albums chart. The album continued to sell steadily and was eventually certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on May 15, 1995.|$|E

Lebrón appeared as a witness at the [...] "International Tribunal on Violations of Human Rights in Puerto Rico and Vieques" [...] held on November 17–21, 2000, {{on the island of}} Vieques. According to the local newspaper El Vocero, her audience applauded when Lebrón said {{at the end of her}} deposition [...] "I had the honor of leading the act against the U.S. Congress on March 1, 1954, when we demanded freedom for Puerto Rico and we told <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are an invaded nation, occupied and abused by the United States of America. I feel very proud of having performed that day, of having answered the call of the motherland". On June 26, 2001, Lebrón was among a group of protesters that were arrested for trespassing in the restricted area in Vieques. On July 19, 2001, she was sentenced to 60 days of prison on the charge that she was trespassing on Navy property. Lebrón had already served 23 days in jail since her June arrest, leaving her to serve 37 additional days. Less than two years after Lebron's Vieques protest, on May 1, 2003, the U.S. Navy left Vieques and turned over its facilities to the government of Puerto Rico. Following this, she continued her participation in other pro independence activities. Lebrón was among the political leaders that opposed the Democratic Party's primary that took place on June 1, 2008. The group anticipated a low voter turnout in the event, while declaring that Puerto Rico [...] "deserves sovereignty". On June 10, 2008, Lebrón suffered a fracture in her hip and a wrist after accidentally falling in her house. She underwent corrective surgery at a San Juan hospital. A film inspired by Lebrón's life is currently in the works, with actress Eva Longoria being involved.|$|E
500|$|During the 1890s, Walker became {{active in}} politics. [...] Walker's {{activism}} was heightened by {{an incident in}} June 1897 in which residents of Urbana, Ohio, formed a lynch mob, removed a black man named [...] "Click" [...] Mitchell from the town jail, and publicly killed him by hanging. [...] Believing that Ohio's Republican Governor Asa Bushnell had failed to conduct an appropriate investigation into the lynching, Walker and other African Americans in Ohio left the Republican Party and formed the Negro Protective Party. [...] As {{a member of the}} party's Executive Committee, Walker helped organize the party's convention at Columbus, Ohio in September 1897. [...] The party adopted a platform demanding [...] "an immediate recognition of our rights as citizens such as have been repeatedly pledged and as often violated," [...] and declaring an intention [...] "to take immediate political action that we may show to <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are no longer the plaything of politicians or chattels for sale to the highest bidder." [...] The party also began publishing [...] "The Negro Protector" [...] as its official organ. [...] When former slave and Republican Party official, Nelson T. Gant, attacked Walker and the Negro Protective Party, Walker responded with an open letter that was published in Ohio newspapers. [...] In the letter, Walker wrote:Notwithstanding N. T. Gant there are many [...] "intelligent Negroes" [...] who will support the Negro protective ticket and will hurl back at him with contempt his insults to their manhood that they are not free to leave the republican party without being branded as [...] "betrayers of their party" [...] and [...] "ungrateful to their Creator and their race." [...] Such fumings are manifestly the strongest evidence of an enslaved mind... Republicans... believe, or make pretense of believing, that the Negro owes eternal allegiance to the G. O. P. no matter what the issue... We shall not trespass further upon your valuable space, except to say that the Negro Protective party will live and its supporters hope never to regret the stand taken for free and independent manhood as a protest against every disregard, from whatever source, of the rights and privileges of the Negro as an American citizen.|$|E

In Nelson Goodman???s definition, relativism appears as a theoretical concept, in which a single object can be viewed from different perspectives, all resulting from the cognitive orientation of the individual yet considered equally valid. The activity of analysis or the project of urban architecture is influenced by both a myriad of aspects of life of spatial, political and socioeconomic nature, as also by their impact on the perception that the individual has of the constructed environment. As a subject of study, Naples can be related through an indefinite number of perceptions that are evidently equal in the level of volatility and conflictuality of the city, ever changing. Often alternative visions of the urban environment and its elements are the starting point for analysis, survey and representation of the space: from many points of view the city relates, represents and subdivides. The continuing transformation represented by the collective structure of the city to which is entrusted the vision of urban form and an invariant design primarily connected to strategic locations, capable of providing the framework on which to prefigure images of themes and actions at all scales...|$|R
