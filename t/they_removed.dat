5|$|Gambira started {{attending}} school at age five, but the 1988 pro-democracy protests caused school closings that interrupted Gambira's schooling. According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), {{he ran away}} from home at age 12 and was recruited as a child soldier by a military unit in Yangon. Once his parents located him, <b>they</b> <b>removed</b> him from the unit and returned with him to their home in Pauk Township. When the authorities came to investigate, Gambira's parents enrolled him in a local monastery to protect him from arrest or conscription into further military service.|$|E
5|$|It {{also led}} to the birth and {{diffusion}} of small independent record labels, often an extension of record shops and independent recording studios, which sometimes produced both punk and metal releases. Indie labels are considered important to the movement's evolution, because <b>they</b> <b>removed</b> the intrusion of corporate business which had hindered rock music in the late 1970s, giving local bands the chance to experiment with more extreme forms of music.|$|E
5|$|On 4 November Italian troops entered Pola {{and seized}} Tegetthoff and Prinz Eugen. The Italians kept Tegetthoff {{for their own}} use. She was {{featured}} in the movie Eroi di nostri mari ("Heroes of our seas") about the sinking of Szent Istv√°n., and was broken her up in 1924 following the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. Prinz Eugen became French property. <b>They</b> <b>removed</b> the main armament for inspection and used the ship to test aerial bombardment attacks. She was finally used as a target ship by the battleships , , and , and sunk in the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|After {{complaining}} of headaches and suffering slurred speech beginning in early 1943, McNary {{went to the}} Bethesda, Maryland, Naval Hospital on November 8, 1943, where doctors diagnosed a malignant brain tumor. <b>They</b> <b>removed</b> it that week, and McNary {{was released from the}} hospital on December 2, but the cancer had already spread to other parts of his body. He and his family departed for Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to spend the winter. He partly recovered from the surgery, but by February 24, 1944, when he was re-elected as Republican Senate leader, he was comatose. Charles L. McNary died in Fort Lauderdale, and he was buried in Belcrest Memorial Cemetery in Salem. He was given a state funeral during which his body lay in state in the chamber of the Oregon House of Representatives at the Oregon State Capitol, Salem.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Rosendo Pascual {{and colleagues}} {{described}} a lower jaw of Sudamerica, which had previously only been known from isolated teeth. This jaw fragment showed that Sudamerica had four molariform teeth {{on each side}} of the lower jaws, more than any multituberculate, and consequently <b>they</b> <b>removed</b> gondwanatheres from Multituberculata and regarded their affinities as uncertain. As a consequence, Kielan-Jaworowska and colleagues excluded Gondwanatheria from multituberculates, but identified the jaw fragment and a few upper premolars of Ferugliotherium as indeterminate multituberculates in a 2001 paper and a 2004 book. However, in 2009 Yamila Gurovich and Robin Beck identified these fossils as Ferugliotherium and argued in favor of a close relationship between gondwanatheres (including Ferugliotheriidae) and multituberculates.|$|E
5|$|The details {{surrounding}} Warkworth Castle's {{role in the}} English Civil War are unclear, but {{the conflict}} resulted in further damage to the structure. Initially held by Royalist forces, the castle was still important enough that when the Scots invaded in 1644 they forced its surrender. Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland, supported Parliament, which may have prevented the Scots from doing much damage to the castle. Parliamentarian forces took over the castle in 1648; when they withdrew <b>they</b> <b>removed</b> the castle's doors and iron {{so that it could}} not be reused by the enemy. They may also have partially demolished some of the castle, and may be responsible for its present state. Algernon Percy unsuccessfully applied for compensation in 1649 for the damage.|$|E

5|$|The police {{continued}} the investigation, {{under pressure to}} finish quickly. Two reconstructions of the murder were conducted, drawing hundreds of spectators. One was done with Sumaji {{playing the role of}} the murderer, without his lawyers' knowledge; when the counsel found out, <b>they</b> <b>removed</b> him from the reconstruction. Eventually, police agreed to a deal with the counsel, in which Sumaji's pre-trial release was guaranteed in exchange for a promise from his lawyers to not sue for wrongful arrest. Sumaji was released on 17 December, awaiting trial. In early 1997, Sumaji's case was refused by the prosecutor's office several times due to weak evidence.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower was}} placed into the {{guardianship}} of the Ministry of Works in 1948. The ministry carried out extensive repairs, attempting {{to retain a}} mixture of the medieval and newer features in the building. <b>They</b> <b>removed</b> the old medieval elm and oak foundations {{and replaced them with}} concrete supports, and installed a replacement roof in 1949, removing the first floor entrance and reinstalling the spiral staircase from the ground floor in 1953. The inside of the tower was rendered to hide the traces of the various work. The Jewel Tower was opened for tourists in 1956, and drew between 500 and 800 visitors each week.|$|E

The 1st Commando Brigade carried out a preliminary move across the river over a railway bridge some distance away from their objective and after forcing their way across, <b>they</b> <b>removed</b> the explosives that had been placed on the bridge and dug in on the other side. Over the course of about three-and-a-half hours they repelled a number of determined counterattacks, before No. 6 Commando, supported by Vickers machine guns fixed bayonets and charged the German marines that were defending the bridge, and inflicting heavy casualties upon them.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the New Kingdom, Egypt {{had entered}} a long period of {{political}} and economic decline. The priests at Thebes grew more powerful, and they effectively administered Upper Egypt, while kings ruling from Tanis controlled Lower Egypt. Some attempt at using the open tombs was made {{at the start of the}} Twenty-first Dynasty, with the High Priest of Amun, Pinedjem I, adding his cartouche to KV4. The Valley began to be heavily plundered, so during the Twenty-first Dynasty the priests of Amun opened most of the tombs and moved the mummies into three tombs in order to better protect them. <b>They</b> <b>removed</b> most of the treasure in order to further protect the bodies from robbers. Most of these were later moved to a single cache near Deir el-Bari (known as TT320). Located in the cliffs overlooking Hatshepsut's famous temple, this mass reburial contained a large number of royal mummies. They were found in a great state of disorder, many placed in other's coffins, and several are still unidentified. Other mummies were moved to the tomb of Amenhotep II, where over a dozen mummies, many of them royal, were later relocated.|$|E
5|$|Illustrator and {{designer}} Kory Heinzen worked on pre-visualization, concept and character design {{on the video}} game , developed by Naughty Dog. Heinzen's initial concept differed from the finished character. The production staff drew inspiration from the pulp adventure genre when creating the video games in the Uncharted series, and based Drake on the stereotypical characters of adventure films and novels, giving him wit, resourcefulness, and strong principles. Naughty Dog wanted to highlight Drake's personality through his interactions with the environment during gameplay. To do this, they developed {{a wide range of}} animations for Drake, allowing him to display reactions and his snarky disposition in context. These animations were designed to be fluid and believable; <b>they</b> <b>removed</b> any animation that did not promote this fluidity or took a large amount of time to execute. The blended animation system in the game, with more than 30animations comprising one movement, was implemented to make Drake a more relatable character.|$|E
5|$|On 12 May 2005, Red Football {{announced}} that it had reached an agreement with shareholders J. P. McManus and John Magnier to purchase Cubic Expression's 28.7% stake in the club, which gave the Glazers a controlling stake with just under 57% of the club's shares. They then managed to secure the stake of the third-largest stakeholder, Scottish mining entrepreneur Harry Dobson, taking their share total to 62% of the club. By 13 May, the Glazers had bought a further 12.8% stake taking their total ownership to 74.81%, just shy of the 75% threshold {{that would allow them}} to end the club's public limited company (PLC) status and delist it from the London Stock Exchange. On 16 May, the Glazers took their shareholding in Manchester United to 75.7%, and a month later, on 22 June, <b>they</b> <b>removed</b> the club's shares from the stock exchange for the first time in 14 years.|$|E

5|$|The North American and European {{releases}} of Dirge of Cerberus received a major overhaul as the developers were not completely {{satisfied with the}} final Japanese version of the game. They also {{wanted to make the}} game more single-player oriented, and as such, <b>they</b> <b>removed</b> Online Multiplayer support, primarily {{due to the lack of}} popularity of PlayOnline outside Japan, and lack of PS2 HDD support in the U.S. Missions from the Multiplayer Mode were reworked into unlockable secret missions in the English-language versions of the game, although none of the additional storyline presented in the Japanese Multiplayer Mode featured in the English versions. The Easy Mode, which was originally featured in the Japanese version to assist gamers not overly familiar with shooter games, was also removed. On September 11, 2008, the English-language version was released in Japan as , as part of Square's Ultimate Hits lineup.|$|E
5|$|When the Indiana Territory {{was first}} created, no {{provision}} was {{allowed for the}} creation of popularly elected government. Congress granted the President power to appoint a General Court to serve as a legislative and judicial branch of the territorial government. The court consisted of five members, and the President delegated the task of choosing the members to the Governor of the territory. This remained the form of government until 1805 when Congress granted the territory the right to legalize slavery if they so choose. In doing so, <b>they</b> <b>removed</b> the court's legislative powers, leaving it with only judicial authority, but still to be appointed by the President through the Governor. The formation of a new legislative council was approved and each county in the territory was granted the right to elect one representative to it. The council had the authority to pass laws, but they all had to be approved by the Governor before they could be enacted.|$|E
5|$|Writer Mike Scully came up {{with the}} idea for the plot because he used to live in West Springfield, Massachusetts and he would ask his parents if he could take the bus to Springfield, Massachusetts and they finally agreed to let him one day. The {{production}} team faced several challenges during development of this episode. The animators had to come up with a special mouth chart to draw Bart's mouth with the joke teeth in. The pile of dead animals in the back of Cletus' truck originally included dead puppies, but the animators thought it was too sad, so <b>they</b> <b>removed</b> them. Scully used to write jokes for Yakov Smirnoff so he called him up to get the signs in Russian. Dan Castellaneta had to learn proper Russian pronunciation so he could speak it during the chess scene in which he voiced the Russian chess player.|$|E

5|$|Magnavox {{designed}} {{the exterior of}} the machine, and re-engineered some the internals with some consultation from Baer and Harrison; <b>they</b> <b>removed</b> the ability to display color, used only the three dial controller, and changed the system of selecting games from a dial to separate game cards that modified the console's circuitry when plugged into the console. At the time, color televisions were still seen as a luxury item, and the ability to show color would have added additional expense and time spent dealing with FCC testing and regulations. The internal circuitry had been designed with discrete components rather than integrated circuits due to cost concerns; these concerns were no longer valid by 1971, but Magnavox did not have enough time to redesign every internal component of the machine prior to the planned production start date. Magnavox named the console first as the Skill-O-Vision while testing, and then released it as the Odyssey. The rifle game was turned into a separately sold add-on game, Shooting Gallery, and Magnavox added paper money, playing cards, and poker chips to the console, {{to go along with the}} plastic overlays for the games that enhanced the primitive visuals. The new additions helped raise the price of the console to US$99.99. Baer was upset with the board game additions, which he felt were pointless add-ons that would go unused by players. Magnavox announced the system's launch date of September 1972, and demonstrated it for months prior to Magnavox dealerships and media.|$|E
5|$|The {{early years}} of the new canal were marred by legal {{disputes}} with the Conservators of the River Tone. The connection to the Tone at Taunton had been made forcibly, by the Canal Company breaching the bank of the river. In August 1827 they announced that they were taking over the Tone, and evicted William Goodland, the river superintendent, from his cottage. Despite a ruling by the Court of King's Bench that their action was illegal, the Canal Company held on to the river until a High Court judgement in February 1830. The Conservators promptly built a dam, to prevent boats reaching the river and water entering the canal, which <b>they</b> <b>removed</b> after further legal action and an Order of the Chancery Court. Reconciliation finally came in late 1831, when the two parties proposed a new Act of Parliament to authorise the sale of the Tone Navigation to the Canal Company. This was obtained in July 1832, and required the Canal Company to erect a new iron bridge to replace the existing North Town Bridge, which hampered access to the wharfs in Taunton. They also had powers to construct a lock and a short length of canal at French Weir, to connect with the Grand Western Canal, while the Conservators were allowed to conduct an annual inspection of the canal, and to resume their ownership of the river if the canal was not maintained in good order.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was intended}} to stay true to the Dragon Quest formula within the design necessities and limitations of an MMORPG. During an earlier development phase, the UI featured {{a large amount of}} information showing the various player statuses, but seeking to streamline and simplify the game, <b>they</b> <b>removed</b> most of the display. A different gameplay challenge was presented by the move from turn-based to real-time battles, which went against the traditions of the Dragon Quest series. Fujisawa wanted to implement the classic battle system, but was opposed by Horii and other staff members, who successfully pushed for a real-time combat system. Elements of that battle system, such as the ability to halt enemy momentum as a battle mechanic, proved extremely challenging for the developers. Speaking about the difference between Dragon Quest X and Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, Yoshida said that they needed to preserve the atmosphere of a normal Dragon Quest title despite MMORPGs not being designed for solo playing. It was for this reason that the loaning of player characters as NPC party members was incorporated. During later development, and following the game's release, the main focus was on balancing the various elements, items and weapons so as to create a level playing field, in addition to keeping the in-game economy balanced. Several features featured in earlier entries, such as the Casino and Coliseum, needed to be kept back for a later time.|$|E
