5|$|A {{performing}} arts centre, the Dwight Centre, {{was completed in}} April 2003 with facilities for English and music teaching, drama and music technology. The most recent additions to the school are a new sixth form centre (the Hazel Centre), <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> astroturf pitch and a new refectory.|$|E
5|$|Boucherett {{paid for}} <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> family seat in 1790; Willingham House was {{a larger and}} grander mansion than the family's {{previous}} seat closer to Willingham, and was constructed in the neoclassical style, most likely by Robert Mitchell, two {{miles west of the}} earlier house.|$|E
5|$|Funding for {{the city}} hall came from several sources. In 1889, the Oregon Legislative Assembly {{approved}} a sale of $175,000 worth of bonds by the City of Portland to finance <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> city hall. The building ultimately cost $575,000.|$|E

50|$|As {{with all}} varieties, the {{category}} of semigroups with involution admits free objects. <b>The</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> free semigroup (or monoid) with involution is based on that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> free semigroup (and respectively that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> free monoid). Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> free group can easily be derived by refining <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> free monoid with involution.|$|R
5|$|In 1949, the Board of Transportation {{issued a}} $504,000,000 plan to {{increase}} capacity on several subway lines through <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> trunk line under Second Avenue.|$|E
5|$|In October 2007, Mayor Daley {{appointed}} Chico {{as president}} of the Chicago Park District Board of Commissioners. Chico supported <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> soccer field in Lincoln Park despite opposition from local residents. In 2010, he stepped down.|$|E
5|$|In September 2015, Parker {{announced}} {{the launch of}} his own basketball academy {{in the city of}} Lyon.

50|$|Nepal and the Soviet Union had {{established}} diplomatic relations on June 5 - July 9, 1956. In April 1959, the countries signed several agreements, including {{the ones on}} economic and technical aid (foresaw free assistance in <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hydroelectric power station with a power line, a sugar mill, a cigarette factory, and assistance in conducting prospecting works for <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> highway), and on free aid to Nepal for <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hospital. In 1964, the Soviet Union and Nepal signed an agreement on free aid for <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> agricultural machinery plant.|$|R
30|$|Key to the {{distinction}} between <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MSPF and <b>the</b> GMSF, children’s simultaneous coordination of units was documented as a developmental prerequisite for <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> GMSF; however, simultaneous coordination of units was {{not found to be}} a developmental prerequisite for <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MSPF. Although <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MSPF was found to be positively related with the simultaneous coordination of three levels of units, several students were documented to have constructed a MSPF without simultaneously coordinating three levels of units. However, no students were found to have constructed a GMSF without first being able to simultaneously coordinate three levels of units. This finding is consistent with the proposed learning progression, in that some children who are only able to coordinate a three-level structure sequentially as two two-level structures can still solve tasks like that presented in Fig.  4 (a task designed to indicate <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MSPF). However, this sequential coordination of units is not sufficient for <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> GMSF, which is required for tasks like the one presented in Fig.  5.|$|R
50|$|In 1908 {{the federal}} {{government}} established the law that authorized <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> railway line from Las Rosas to Bouquet. After obtaining the land, work started in 1910 including <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small town adjacent to the railway station.|$|R
5|$|After 1952, Willamette Law {{received}} a large Lady Justice statue when the Marion County Courthouse was demolished {{to make way}} for a new one. In 1959, the school started a law review, while enrollment increased to 185 by the mid-1960s. Because of the increased enrollment, the College of Law Foundation was created by the university's trustees in 1959 to explore <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> facility. Willamette switched to the awarding of the Juris Doctor from the bachelor of laws, phased in beginning in 1965.|$|E
5|$|An {{advisory}} committee {{was formed by}} the city council in 1956 to propose sites for a new city hall and civic center campus. The city council placed a $250,000 bond issue on the November 1956 ballot to fund <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> city hall, but voters defeated the proposition. City offices instead moved to a former hardware store near the Bellevue Square shopping center in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Behind the sea wall, {{the marshes}} were drained after the war, and reverted to farmland, but {{the bank was}} {{breached}} in the North Sea flood of 1953, returning the whole area to tidal saltmarsh dominated by sea aster. <b>The</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> sea wall across the reserve created a shallow freshwater lagoon, with a reed bed on its northern side and a vegetation-free brackish marsh.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> free {{restriction}} category can {{be broken}} into two steps: <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> free stable semilattice fibration followed by <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> free restriction category for this fibration. Restriction categories produced from such fibrations are “unitary”, in a sense which generalizes that from the theory of inverse semigroups. Characterization theorems for unitary restriction categories are derived. The paper ends with <b>an</b> explicit description <b>of</b> the free restriction category on a directed graph. 1...|$|R

5|$|For 24-year-old Hanshin Tigers fan Masaya Shitababa, the 2003 celebration was a tragedy. He {{drowned in}} the canal, with all reports being {{that he had been}} shoved in by the revelers. To prevent future incidents, the Osaka city council ordered <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Ebisubashi bridge {{beginning}} in 2004, which will {{make it more difficult for}} fans to take the celebratory leap should the Curse of the Colonel be broken and the Tigers win again.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, {{the resort}} {{benefited from a}} £14million (2011:£) {{investment}} and improvement scheme, following which the resort was known as Funcoast World. Around this time, many of the structures were subject to change with the demolition of many chalets and some central buildings including the Windsor dining hall and Empire theatre. The 1980s saw {{the removal of the}} miniature railway and chairlift system, but also saw <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> indoor swimming pool named the Funsplash and an outdoor fun pool.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{construction}} {{began on}} the Quonset Freeway, a relocated Route403 that serves the Quonset Business Park from Route4. The project included the reconstruction and reworking of exit7 off Route4, which was a southbound-only exit serving both Route403 and Route402 when constructed. The exit was converted into a trumpet interchange with new ramps between Route4, Route403 and Route402 and was completed in December 2008, one year ahead of schedule. The project included <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> northbound exit7 serving Route403 east.|$|E

50|$|In 2000, <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> PLC {{building}} {{was started in}} Abu Dis, but the project was never finished. In late December 2003, Israel started <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> separation wall just few meters away from the planned headquarters, separating Abu Dis from East Jerusalem.|$|R
5|$|In 2011, the UT Board of Regents {{approved}} <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> 13 story {{hospital that}} will be located next to John Sealy Hospital. Construction will begin {{in the fall of}} 2011, with the demolition of the old Jennie Sealy and Shriners hospitals, and continue until completion in 2016. The facility will have 250 room, 20 operating suites and 54 intensive care beds. When the new hospital is complete, along with the renovations at John Sealy, both complexes will have around 600 beds.|$|E
5|$|In early 1345, Kantakouzenos sent Franciscan monks to the regency to make {{an offer}} of conciliation, but it was rejected. Despite this show of confidence, the regency's {{position}} remained insecure. The defections of the previous winter had weakened their control of the capital, and in response Apokaukos launched a series of proscriptions. He also ordered <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> prison to house political prisoners. On 11 June 1345, while undertaking an inspection of the prison unaccompanied by his bodyguard, Apokaukos was lynched by the prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> harbour had begun, the Kidwelly and Llanelli Canal Company {{constructed}} a tramway from Llanelli to Pwll colliery. Another tramway was built from Burry Port to the coal levels at New Lodge, with a branch to Kilrhos. The company planned to link New Lodge to Pwll in due course, {{so that there}} would be a tramway link from Burry Port harbour to Llanelli; the connection was eventually opened on 8 July 1837.|$|E
50|$|Since 2013, the Ameropa Foundation {{has been}} {{providing}} humanitarian support to Roma children in Roșia, Sibiu.

5|$|Popper {{eventually}} relented, after {{admitting that}} the larger dreadnought type design would also warrant <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> floating dry dock, which would significantly increase {{the cost of the}} project. The design board selected the fifth design, though during refinement of the design, the secondary guns were increased in caliber from 19cm to 24cm. The 30.5cm gun was chosen because the breech of the new 28cm was unreliable. The resulting design was the last pre-dreadnought type of battleship built by the Austro-Hungarian navy.|$|E
5|$|Possibly {{present at}} King William's {{death in a}} hunting accident, Warelwast served as a diplomat to the king's successor, Henry I. After the {{resolution}} of the Investiture Controversy, Warelwast was rewarded with the bishopric of Exeter in Devon, but he continued to serve Henry as a diplomat and royal judge. He began <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> cathedral at Exeter, and he probably divided the diocese into archdeaconries. Warelwast went blind after 1120, and after his death in 1137 was succeeded by his nephew, Robert Warelwast.|$|E
