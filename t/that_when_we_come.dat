6000|$|Let us {{endeavor}} so to live <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to die even [...] the undertaker will be sorry. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's [...] Calendar ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why,' {{said the}} young Duke, 'I {{am not a}} believer in the perfectibility of the species; and you know, <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to a certain point----' ...|$|E
6000|$|It shineth in his glazing eye, [...] It burneth on his face; [...] God send <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to die [...] We {{know that}} sign of grace! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My gracious, did <b>we</b> {{jump over}} <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> this way?" [...] queried the senator's son, as all {{gazed at the}} wide opening, which was of unknown depth.|$|R
60|$|Therefore it was <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> {{each day}} on the green {{in front of my}} uncle's house to go through such {{manoeuvres}} as our instructor thought necessary, we had in our hands only those harmless wooden guns.|$|R
5000|$|... "These people haven't heard heavy metal. They can't take it. If {{you play}} it for 24 hours, your brain and body {{functions}} start to slide, your {{train of thought}} slows down and your will is broken. <b>That's</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> in and talk to them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> and see you," [...] said Madame Grandoni, [...] "we must be {{sure and}} bring our smelling-bottles. And pray have a few soft sofas {{conveniently}} placed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{the best}} part of it all. Mr Hall is such a brick, <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> back from the Isle of Wight he is going to take us all in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! Well, the war cannot {{last for}} ever. You may have Wellington {{here before the}} year is out. Give me your address, so <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come,</b> I may find you out." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{never so}} much as asked me about my fortune or estate, but assured me <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to Dublin he would {{jointure}} me in #600 a year good land; and that we could enter into a deed of settlement or contract here {{for the performance of}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... "My brother {{declared}} that he, and Mr. Fielding, I think, was the name, were the greatest geniuses in England; and {{often used to}} say, <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to Europe, his first pilgrimage would be to Mr. Richardson," [...] cried Harry, always impetuous, honest, and tender, when {{he spoke of the}} dearest friend.|$|R
60|$|We {{arrived back}} at the cross-roads sodden and dripping, and, finding the train waiting, climbed into it with some relief. The officer on this train could speak nothing but Flemish, but he {{understood}} the name Mechlin, and indicated <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to Mechlin Station he would put us down, which, after the right interval of time, he did.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know, Robert, I {{have been}} {{thinking}} {{so much about the}} future, and I think <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> back from our travels we ought to put aside almost all our money to do good with." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ye were right," [...] said Hoseason to Alan. [...] "Ye {{have saved}} the brig, sir. I'll mind <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to clear accounts." [...] And I believe he not only meant what he said, but would have done it; so high a place did the Covenant hold in his affections.|$|E
60|$|CHRIS. I know you: Gehazi {{was your}} great-grandfather, and Judas your father, {{and you have}} trod in their steps. It is but a devilish prank that thou usest: thy father was hanged for a traitor, and thou deservest no better reward. Assure thyself <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to the King, we will tell him of this thy behavior. Thus they went their way.|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot but mind, your worship, <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> up the Orinoco, the Indians told us terrible {{stories of}} those mountains, {{how far they}} stretched, and how {{difficult}} they were to cross, by reason of the cliffs aloft, and the thick forests in the valleys. And have we not lost five good men there already?" ...|$|R
60|$|Before {{we reached}} the plain of Phutra we were {{discovered}} by a company of Sagoths, who at first stood to give battle; but upon seeing the vast numbers of our army they turned and fled toward Phutra. The result of this was <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> in sight of the hundred towers which mark the entrances to the buried city we found a great army of Sagoths and Mahars lined up to give us battle.|$|R
60|$|We took up at a rural bar-room, {{after we}} had gone a few miles, an {{intoxicated}} gentleman who climbed upon the roof among the luggage, and subsequently slipping off without hurting himself, {{was seen in the}} distant perspective reeling back to the grog-shop where we had found him. We also parted with more of our freight at different times, so <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to change horses, I was again alone outside.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Not much,' says Jone, givin' a pull {{which brought}} me {{right up to}} the top o' the wall an' almost clean down the other side, with one jerk. 'I never knowed no {{officers}} that would do that. But,' says he, a kind o' shuttin' his eyes so that she shouldn't see he was lyin', 'we'll talk about <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> back.' ...|$|E
60|$|CHR. I know you; Gehazi {{was your}} great-grandfather, and Judas your father; {{and you have}} trod in their steps (2 Kings 5:20; Matt. 26:14, 15; 27:1-5). It is but a devilish prank that thou usest; thy father was hanged for a traitor, and thou deservest no better reward. Assure thyself, <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to the King, we will do Him word of this thy behaviour. Thus they went their way.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe there}} is no one in the whole world," [...] he said, after a pause, [...] "whose {{friendship}} is more to me than yours is. I think of it so often, Mary. Say <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> back it shall be between us as it used to be." [...] Then he put out his hand for hers, and she could not help giving it to him. [...] "Of course there will be people," [...] he said, [...] "who talk nonsense, and one cannot help it; but I will not put up with it from you." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2003 Sergeant Mark Hadsell {{claimed to}} have used loud music during the {{interrogation}} of Iraqi prisoners: [...] "These people havent heard heavy metal. They cant take it. If you play it for 24 hours, your brain and body functions start to slide, your train of thought slows down and your will is broken. <b>Thats</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> in and talk to them." [...] Other reports {{of the use of}} music during interrogation have occasionally plagued PSYOP.|$|R
6000|$|... "Be jabers, Terence," [...] O'Grady said, as {{the coach}} drove into Athlone, [...] "one {{might think that}} it was only {{yesterday}} that we went away. There are the old shops, and the same people standing at their doors to see the coach come in; and I think I could swear even to that cock, standing at the gate leading into the stables. What games we had here. Who would have thought <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> back, you would be my senior officer!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The trouble is," [...] resumed the captain, [...] "that all our firelocks, {{great and}} little, {{are in the}} round-house under this man's nose; {{likewise}} the powder. Now, if I, {{or one of the}} officers, was to go in and take them, he would fall to thinking. But a lad like you, David, might snap up a horn and a pistol or two without remark. And if ye can do it cleverly, I'll bear it in mind when it'll be good for you to have friends; and <b>that's</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to Carolina." ...|$|R
60|$|And then, {{when they}} parted, the two clergymen {{of the parish}} shook hands with each other again, having perhaps less {{animosity}} against each other than they had ever felt before. There had been a joke or two over the table, at which both had laughed. The priest had wisely shown some deference to the parson, and the parson had immediately returned it, by referring some question to the priest. How often does it not happen <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> across those whom we have hated and avoided all our lives, we find {{that they are not}} quite so bad as we had thought? That old gentleman of whom we wot is never so black as he has been painted.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed I {{think that}} you can do no better," [...] said Percy heartily, [...] "and I swear to you on {{jeopardy}} of my soul that I will stand by you in the matter! I doubt not <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> deep into their land they will draw together and do what they may to make head against us; but up to now I swear by all the saints of Lindisfarne that I should have seen more war in a summer's day in Liddesdale or at the Forest of Jedburgh than any that Brittany has shown us. But see, yonder horsemen are riding in. They are our own hobblers, are they not? And who are these who are lashed to their stirrups?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Those are {{beautiful}} verses, {{and they have}} remained in my memory all my life. But if the closing lines are true, let us hope <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to answer the call and deliver the land from its errors, we shall secrete from it some of our high-civilization ways, {{and at the same}} time borrow some of its pagan ways to enrich our high system with. We have a right to do this. If we lift those people up, we have a right to lift ourselves up nine or ten grades or so, at their expense. A few years ago I spent several weeks at Tolz, in Bavaria. It is a Roman Catholic region, and not even Benares is more deeply or pervasively or intelligently devout. In my diary of those days I find this: ...|$|E
5000|$|As {{the filmmakers}} began {{to cast the}} film, they faced the realities of a {{language}} in decline. Co-director Alí Allié {{said that they were}} [...] "shocked that there was almost no one under 18 years old who spoke the language, and that was something we were kind of in denial about. And <b>that’s</b> <b>when</b> the film took on more urgency, and <b>that’s</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> up with the title, Garifuna in Peril." [...] All of the cast members were of Garifuna descent from Honduras and Belize, with the film being their first time performing {{for the majority of the}} cast.|$|R
60|$|I shall {{say no more}} of {{the journey}} than <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to those frightful mountains, the Alps, there was no {{travelling}} in our coaches, so he ordered a horse-litter, but carried by mules, {{to be provided for}} me, and himself went on horseback. The coaches went some other way back to Lyons. Then we had coaches hired at Turin, which met us at Suza; so that we were accommodated again, and went by easy journeys afterwards to Rome, where his business, whatever it was, called him to stay some time, and from thence to Venice.|$|R
60|$|At {{nine o'clock}} <b>that</b> night, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> {{out through the}} gates of the big, noisy station, the {{children}} were awaiting us. They had changed, they had grown. Biddy kissed me shyly, and stood staring up at me.|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet there's this futility.... You know, my dear lady, I don't {{know what}} to do. One feels on the one hand, that here is a cloud of witnesses, great men, sainted men, subtle men, figures {{permanently}} historical, before whom one can do nothing but bow down in the utmost humility, here is a great instrument and organization--what would the world be without the witness of the church?--and {{on the other hand}} here are our masses out of hand and hostile, our industrial leaders equally hostile; there is a failure to grip, and that failure to grip is so clearly traceable to the fact that our ideas are not modern ideas, <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to profess our faith we find nothing in our mouths but antiquated Alexandrian subtleties and phrases and ideas that may have been quite alive, quite significant, quite adequate in Asia Minor or Egypt, among men essentially orientals, fifteen hundred years ago, but which now--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How do {{you make}} that out, father?" [...] I asked. He had been very rude over {{the matter of the}} death-duties of his own estate, though it is entailed and I must inherit. So I {{determined}} to let him see that I know a good deal more than he does--of law, at any rate. [...] "I fear <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to look into it closely that dog won't fight. In the first place, that may be all arranged in the letter to St. Leger, which {{is a part of the}} Will. And if that letter should be inoperative by his refusal of the conditions (whatever they may be), then the letter to the attorney begins to work. What it is we don't know, and perhaps even he doesn't--I looked at it as well as I could--and we law men are trained to observation. But even if the instructions mentioned as being in Letter C fail, then the corpus of the Will gives full power to Trent to act just as he darn pleases. He can give the whole thing to himself if he likes, and no one can say a word. In fact, he is himself the final court of appeal." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now {{it is an}} irritating and pathetic {{thing that}} the three most popular phrases about Shaw are false. Modern criticism, like all weak things, is {{overloaded}} with words. In a healthy condition of language a man finds {{it very difficult to}} say the right thing, but at last says it. In this empire of journalese a man finds it so very easy to say the wrong thing that he never thinks of saying anything else. False or meaningless phrases lie so ready to his hand that it is easier to use them than not to use them. These wrong terms picked up through idleness are retained through habit, and so the man has begun to think wrong almost before he has begun to think at all. Such lumbering logomachy is always injurious and oppressive to men of spirit, imagination or intellectual honour, and it has dealt very recklessly and wrongly with Bernard Shaw. He has contrived to get about three newspaper phrases tied to his tail; and those newspaper phrases are all and separately wrong. The three superstitions about him, it will be conceded, are generally these: first that he desires [...] "problem plays," [...] second that he is [...] "paradoxical," [...] and third that in his dramas as elsewhere he is specially [...] "a Socialist." [...] And the interesting thing is <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to his philosophy, all these three phrases are quite peculiarly inapplicable.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I hardly {{expected}} <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> back <b>we</b> {{should have}} found the peace still unbroken between Wango and Hane, but it is. Though not very good friends, they are still at peace. In the chief's house I was presented {{with a piece of}} pork, about two pounds, and a dish of tauma (their favourite), a pudding made of yams, nuts, and cocoa-nut milk, and cooked by steaming. Fortunately, good manners allowed me to take it away. Before we left the village, it took two women to carry our provisions. A little boy came back with us, to stay with Taki. The two boys who ought to have come last year are very anxious to do so still.|$|R
60|$|Then I {{told him}} <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> back, {{if one of}} those things was missing I would kill him and his people by witchcraft; and if we died and he tried to steal the rifles I would come and haunt him and turn his cattle mad and his milk sour till life was a weariness, and would make the devils in the guns come out and talk to him in a way he did not like, and {{generally}} gave him a good idea of judgment to come. After that he promised to look after them as though they were his father's spirit. He was a very superstitious old Kafir and a great villain.|$|R
60|$|This {{made them}} very glad, {{for it was}} {{certainly}} so that we had passed for three French men-of-war, {{and they were so}} assured of it, that they went afterwards boldly up the coast, and made several very good prizes. We then found also {{that it was one of}} these ships that looked into the road, as above, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were here before, and seeing us then with French colours, took us for the men-of-war they had heard of; and, they added, <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> in upon them again, they gave themselves up for lost men, but were resolved to have fought it out to the last, or rather to have sunk by our side, or blown themselves up, than be taken.|$|R
