5|$|The Sole Survivor investigates a pre-War {{amusement}} park, Nuka-World, when radio advertisements are broadcast {{into the}} Commonwealth. Porter Gage, a veteran raider, contacts the Sole Survivor after boarding a monorail and tells {{them that they}} are walking into a death trap. Upon arrival, the Sole Survivor must navigate an increasingly-deadly obstacle course called <b>the</b> <b>Gauntlet,</b> which culminates in a fight with the raider leader, Overboss Colter. Gage reveals that the fight is rigged as Colter is wearing invulnerable electrically-charged armor, and that no-one survives <b>the</b> <b>Gauntlet.</b> Gage aids the Sole Survivor by helping them exploit the Achilles heel in Colter's armor, becoming the first person to survive <b>the</b> <b>Gauntlet.</b> Following the death of Colter, Gage explains the leaders of the three raider gangs conspired to usurp him, using the broadcast and <b>the</b> <b>Gauntlet</b> to find possible replacements. The Sole Survivor is offered to become the Overboss, but must balance the competing needs of each gang of raiders while conquering the outlying areas of the park. Once the entire park is under raider control, the Sole Survivor sets about expanding raider influence in the Commonwealth by conquering settlements, restoring power to Nuka-World to make the park self-sufficient, and thwarting attempts by the Gunnersa band of amoral mercenariesto seize control of Nuka-World for themselves.|$|E

5|$|Overwatch {{announcement}} video, in 2014, {{contained a}} stray {{reference to a}} gauntlet. Following its obsessive popularity with fans, the developer, Blizzard Entertainment, expanded <b>the</b> <b>gauntlet</b> into a full-fledged, playable character. This period included a series of teasers from the developer and a campaign by actor Terry Crews to voice the character. Doomfist was ultimately voiced by Sahr Ngaujah. In Doomfist's fictional backstory, the playable character became the third generation to wield <b>the</b> <b>gauntlet,</b> and {{is presented as a}} villain after killing his predecessor and becoming a leader of Talon, the game's nemesis group. A digital comic accompanied the character's release.|$|E

5|$|This {{iteration}} of Razer {{competed in}} the second series of Robot Wars, successfully passing <b>the</b> <b>Gauntlet</b> and Trials stages of its heat before being defeated in battle by a robot called Inquisitor. The cause of Razer's immobilisation in this fight was the shearing of nylon cush drives—cushioning blocks designed to prevent stress fractures—in the machine's drive wheels; these were replaced with more robust metal ones for future competitions. As the Robot Wars television series evolved and grew, Razer's design was revised and refined to counter weaknesses {{and take advantage of}} rule changes; by series four, Lewis estimated that Razer had taken 1,500 hours to build, at a cost of £1,600.|$|E
5|$|When {{the group}} reached the village, Alder learned why {{his life had}} been spared. One of the Mingo chiefs, Succohanos, and his wife, Whinecheoh, were an aging couple who had lost their son, and planned to adopt Alder as a replacement. Alder was forced to run <b>the</b> <b>gauntlet,</b> as a rite of passage, and after he {{exhibited}} bravery during the trial, he was adopted and cared for by Whinecheoh.

5|$|From series {{three of}} Robot Wars, <b>the</b> <b>Gauntlet</b> and Trial stages of each heat were dropped, {{with the whole}} of the main {{competition}} formed around direct combat. Razer's first battle of the series was against Backstabber. Scott lowered Razer's arm into an extrusion on Backstabber, and Lewis pushed their opponent into the 'pit', an open hole in the arena floor. In the second round, despite causing damage to Aggrobot, Razer lost due to a mechanical failure: the valve which controls the direction of hydraulic fluid in the arm jammed, causing Razer's arm to raise to its full height and refuse to lower. With its rear wheels off the ground, Razer was weaponless and immobile, and eliminated early from the main competition once more. Outside of the main UK championship, Razer won the concurrent Pinball Warrior Tournament side event and retained the Best Design award.|$|E

[...] CBR ranked <b>The</b> Infinity <b>Gauntlet</b> as <b>the</b> second greatest Thanos story.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Azrael costume worn by Jean-Paul Valley {{consists of}} red and gold armor. After becoming an [...] "Agent of the Bat", he dons silver and black armor with a red cape and a stylized red bat symbol on the chest. Later on, he dons red armor with golden gauntlets, boots, shoulder pads and a blue cape. He sometimes carries a flaming sword, and also uses two retractable daggers hidden in <b>the</b> <b>gauntlets</b> of his costume that can be charged with thermal energy to increase their destructive power. In Batman: The Ultimate Guide to the Dark Knight, Scott Beatty implied that Azrael's changing costumes were reflections {{of the changes in}} Azrael's life from an agent of St. Dumas to an agent of the Batman to his own man. <b>The</b> <b>gauntlets</b> were taken by Kate Spencer, the current Manhunter, and are used in her outfit. The New 52 version of Jean-Paul wears a similar costume, and his weapon is a flaming knight sword called Murasame. He also possesses <b>the</b> familiar <b>gauntlet</b> blades as well.|$|R

5|$|Razer {{made its}} debut in the fourth heat of series two of Robot Wars, which was viewed by almost six million people on BBC Two. It had been {{finished}} late {{the night before the}} recording. Radio interference caused Razer to be hard to control in <b>the</b> <b>Gauntlet</b> stage of the competition, but it successfully navigated the obstacle course and progressed to the Trial. This phase was a robotic football match, wherein Razer scored the first goal to reach the heat semi-final. Its opponent for this one-on-one battle was Inquisitor, a box-shaped robot equipped with a rotating flail. Whilst Razer made the stronger start, crumpling Inquisitor's flail support, the cush drives in its motors sheared after an impact on the arena floor. This rendered Razer immobile and ended a promising run.|$|E
5|$|The Brothers {{took part}} in <b>the</b> <b>gauntlet</b> match at Glory By Honor 2, which was held to fill the tag team {{championship}} left vacant by Red suffering a serious knee injury. They defeated and eliminated the Special K team of Hydro and Angeldust as well as The Ring Crew Express, before being eliminated by the other Special K team in the match, Izzy and Dixie, due to outside interference from Angeldust. After Izzy and Dixie later won the tag team title, the Brothers were granted a shot at it, at Main Event Spectacles. The reason given in the storyline was they were given the shot since they only lost in <b>the</b> <b>gauntlet</b> match because Special K cheated. In the opening segment of that event, they were aligned with Jim Cornette, because, in the storyline, Cornette wanted to create new champions. They attacked his former client, Samoa Joe, who Cornette abandoned since he already was a champion. They {{went on to win}} the belts later in the show. At The Conclusion, The Battle Lines Are Drawn, and The Last Stand, which was by stipulation Joe's last shot at the tag team title for as long as the Briscoe Brothers held it, they retained the belts over Joe and a different partner each time, A.J. Styles, Bryan Danielson, and Jerry Lynn respectively. Since Joe took pinfalls at The Conclusion (to Mark) and The Last Stand (to Jay), both brothers subsequently earned shots at his world title. Both fell; Mark at Final Battle 2003 and Jay at At Our Best in a memorable and bloody steel cage match.|$|E
5|$|Rupert {{arrived in}} England {{following}} his period of imprisonment and final release from captivity in Germany. In August 1642, Rupert, {{along with his}} brother Prince Maurice {{and a number of}} professional soldiers, ran <b>the</b> <b>gauntlet</b> across the sea from the United Provinces, and after one initial failure, evaded the pro-Parliamentary navy and landed in Newcastle. Riding across country, he found the King with a tiny army at Leicester Abbey, and was promptly appointed General of Horse, a coveted appointment at the time in European warfare. Rupert set about recruiting and training: with great effort he had put together a partially trained mounted force of 3,000 cavalry by the end of September. Rupert's reputation continued to rise and, leading a sudden, courageous charge, he routed a Parliamentarian force at Powick Bridge, the first military engagement of the war. Although a small engagement, this had a propaganda value far exceeding the importance of the battle itself, and Rupert became an heroic figure for many young men in the Royalist camp.|$|E
