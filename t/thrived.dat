40|$|This paper {{reports the}} two phases of an evaluative study {{looking at the}} impact of <b>Thrive</b> training. A small Local Authority (LA) in the South West of England {{commissioned}} this study. In phase-one, <b>Thrive</b> trainees completed Likert-type questionnaires about the three areas below: •	Perceived relationships with children with BESD; •	Self-efficacy in managing children’s BESD; and •	Causes to which BESD can be attributed. Data were taken from <b>Thrive</b> trainees who attended either the one-day <b>Thrive</b> training or the nine-day <b>Thrive</b> training. <b>Thrive</b> trainees (n= 60) completed questionnaires before training began and after training had finished. The questionnaire comprised three established scales, investigating the three areas listed above. Data gathered was quantitative and analysis was designed to show differences between participants’ ratings before and after completing the <b>Thrive</b> training. For the nine-day training, results show an overall increase in trainees’ perceived relationship quality, and self-efficacy in managing children’s BESD. It was also seen that <b>Thrive</b> trainees attributed the existence of challenging behaviour to causes thought to be beyond the child’s control yet within the provision control. Findings were less evident for the one-day training. These results are related to past research and conclusions are drawn about {{the efficacy of the}} <b>Thrive</b> training. In phase-two, eight participants were randomly selected from the sample used in phase-one. Participants were interviewed through the process of hierarchical questioning and contextual focusing and qualitative data was gained. The focus of phase-two was to investigate what changes (if any) <b>Thrive</b> trainees identified as occurring due to their attendance on the <b>Thrive</b> training as well as which factors (if any) within the <b>Thrive</b> training particularly facilitated change in each of the areas measured in phase-one (perceived relationship building, self-efficacy and causal-attributions). Thematic analysis was used to draw themes from participants’ responses. Results show that <b>Thrive</b> trainees discussed changes in their behaviour; thoughts; feelings; and personal attributes. Results also found that <b>Thrive</b> trainees attributed these changes, as well as changes relating to the three areas measured quantitatively in phase-one, to specific factors within the <b>Thrive</b> training. These include: •	The delivery style; •	The <b>Thrive</b> model and specific training content; and •	Other mediating factors. Results are discussed with reference to past research; conclusions are drawn about the efficacy of the <b>Thrive</b> training and some general implications for the LA for whom the current research was conducted, as well as for educational psychology practice, are reported...|$|R

50|$|<b>Thriving</b> in {{positive}} psychology definitely aims to promote growth beyond survival, {{but it is}} important to note that some of the theories surrounding the causes and effects of it are more ambiguous. Literature by Carver indicates that the concept of <b>thriving</b> is a difficult one to define objectively. He makes the distinction between physical and psychological <b>thriving,</b> implying that while physical <b>thriving</b> has obvious measurable results, psychological <b>thriving</b> does not as much. This is the origin of much ambiguity surrounding the concept. Carver lists several self-reportable indicators of thriving: greater acceptance of self, change in philosophy, and a change in priorities. These are factors that generally lead a person to feel that they have grown, but obviously are difficult to measure quantitatively.|$|R
