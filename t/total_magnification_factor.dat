40|$|We {{report the}} {{discovery}} of a very bright (r = 20. 16), highly magnified, and yet intrinsically very luminous Lyα emitter (LAE) at z = 2. 82. This system comprises four images in the observer plane with a maximum separation of 6 " and it is lensed by a z = 0. 55 massive early-type galaxy. It was initially identified in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Emission-Line Lens Survey for GALaxy-Lyα EmitteR sYstems (BELLS GALLERY) survey, and follow-up imaging and spectroscopic observations using the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) and William Herschel Telescope (WHT) confirmed the lensing nature of this system. A lens model using a singular isothermal ellipsoid in an external shear field reproduces quite well the main features of the system, yielding an Einstein radius of 2. 95 " +/- 0. 10 ", and a <b>total</b> <b>magnification</b> <b>factor</b> for the LAE of 8. 8 +/- 0. 4. This LAE is one of the brightest and most luminous galaxy-galaxy strong lenses known.

40|$|We present new mass {{models for}} the {{gravitational}} lens system B 1938 + 666, using multiwavelength data acquired from Keck adaptive optics (AO) and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations. These models are the first results from the Strong lensing at High Angular Resolution Program (SHARP), a project designed to study known quadruple image and Einstein ring lenses using high-resolution imaging, in order to probe their mass distributions in unprecedented detail. Here, we specifically highlight differences between AO- and HST-derived lens models, finding that at least when the lens and source galaxies are both bright and red, and the system has {{a high degree of}} circular symmetry AO-derived models place significantly tighter constraints on model parameters. Using this improved precision, we infer important physical properties about the B 1938 + 666 system, including the mass density slope of the lensing galaxy (gamma = 2. 045), the projected dark matter mass fraction within the Einstein radius (Mdark/Mlens = 0. 55) and the <b>total</b> <b>magnification</b> <b>factor</b> of the source galaxy (similar to 13). Additionally, we measure an upper-limit constraint on luminous substructure (MV > 16. 2), based on the non-detection of bright satellite galaxies in all data sets. Finally, we utilize the improved image resolution of the AO data to reveal the presence of faint arcs outside of the primary Einstein ring. The positions and orientations of these arcs raise the intriguing possibility that B 1938 + 666 has a second source galaxy, located at a more distant redshift. However, future work is needed to verify this hypothesis...|$|E

40|$|Context. The {{gravitational}} magnification {{provided by}} massive galaxy clusters {{makes it possible}} to probe the physical conditions in distant galaxies that are of lower luminosity than those in blank fields and likely more representative of the bulk of the high-redshift galaxy population. Aims. We aim to constrain the basic properties of molecular gas in a strongly magnified submm galaxy located behind the massive Bullet Cluster (1 E 0657 - 56). This galaxy (SMM J 0658) is split into three images, with a <b>total</b> <b>magnification</b> <b>factor</b> of almost 100. Methods. We used the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) to search for (CO) -C- 12 (1 - 0) and (CO) -C- 12 (3 - 2) line emission from SMM J 0658. We also used the SABOCA bolometer camera on the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) telescope to measure the continuum emission at 350 mu m. Results. CO(1 - 0) and CO(3 - 2) are detected at 6. 8 sigma and 7. 5 sigma significance when the spectra toward the two brightest images of the galaxy are combined. From the CO(1 - 0) luminosity we derive a mass of cold molecular gas of (1. 8 +/- 0. 3) x 10 (9) M-circle dot, using the CO to H- 2 conversion factor commonly used for luminous infrared galaxies. This is 45 +/- 25 % of the stellar mass. From the width of the CO lines we derive a dynamical mass within the CO-emitting region L of (1. 3 +/- 0. 4) x 10 (10) (L/ 1 kpc) M-circle dot. We refine the redshift determination of SMM J 0658 to z = 2. 7793 +/- 0. 0003. The CO(3 - 2) to CO(1 - 0) brightness temperature ratio is 0. 56 (- 0. 15) (+ 0. 21), which is similar to the values found in other star-forming galaxies. Continuum emission at 350 mu m from SMM J 0658 was detected with SABOCA at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. 6. The flux density is consistent with previous measurements at the same wavelength by the Herschel satellite and BLAST balloon-borne telescope. We study the spectral energy distribution of SMM J 0658 and derive a dust temperature of 33 +/- 5 K and a dust mass of 1. 1 (- 0. 3) (+ 0. 8) x 10 (7) M-circle dot. Conclusions. SMM J 0658 is one of the least massive submm galaxies discovered so far. As a likely representative of the bulk of the submm galaxy population, it is a prime target for future observations...|$|E

40|$|Summary. The <b>magnification</b> <b>factor</b> (M) of {{the retina}} is the linear extent of visual striate cortex {{to which each}} degree of the retina projects. It has been {{suggested}} that <b>magnification</b> <b>factor</b> is directly proportional to visual acuity, but <b>magnification</b> <b>factor</b> measured in monkeys was compared with visual acuity in man. Here we first describe calculation of the <b>magnification</b> <b>factor</b> in man, and then compare it to human visual acuity. We calculated 3 / [for the first 30 degrees of the lower visual field by using infor mation provided by Brindley and Lewin (1968), who plotted the distribution of phosphenes evoked by stimulation of visual cortex in a human patient with electrodes implanted on the visual cortex. Since the inter-electrode distance was specified it was possible to calculate M for each of many pairs of electrodes by measuring the angular separation and mean eccentricity of the corresponding pairs of phosphenes. For the lower visual field, M was approximately 4 ram/degree at 2 degrees eccentricity and declined monotonically to 0. 5 ram/degree at 25 degrees eccentricity. The results indicated that the reciprocal of M is directly proportional to the minimum angle of resolution and, correspondingly, that the <b>magnification</b> <b>factor</b> is directly proportional to visual acuity in man. By extrapolating this function for the whole of the visual field it was possible to estimate the area of striate cortex. The total extent of striate cortex estimated in this way agreed closely with previous direct measurements, suggesting that the measurements of M are accurate.
