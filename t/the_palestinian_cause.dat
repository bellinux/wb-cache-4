5|$|Arafat's long {{personal}} and political survival was taken by most Western commentators {{as a sign of}} his mastery of asymmetric warfare and his skill as a tactician, given the extremely dangerous nature of politics of the Middle East and the frequency of assassinations. Some commentators believe his survival was largely due to Israel's fear that he could become a martyr for <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>cause</b> if he were assassinated or even arrested by Israel. Others believe that Israel refrained from taking action against Arafat because it feared Arafat less than Hamas and the other Islamist movements gaining support over Fatah. The complex and fragile web of relations between the US, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab states contributed also to Arafat's longevity {{as the leader of the}} Palestinians.|$|E

The local village elder Abu Kamal (Makram Khoury) advises her to give in, but Salma decides {{to work with the}} young lawyer Ziad Daud (Ali Suliman). They take their case {{all the way to the}} Supreme Court. Mira Navon (Rona Lipaz-Michael), the minister's wife, sympathizes with Salma. The court case receives notable media attention, and Mira gives a news interview that her husband regrets. Mira believes that the Israeli military overreacted, and she also shares Salma's sense of personal loneliness. Although they never speak, a complex human bond develops between the two women. As <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>cause</b> is dismissed, Mira decides to leave her husband and a concrete wall is built between Salma's land and the Defense Minister's house. A final camera shot reveals the lemon trees have been pruned.|$|E

The US also imposed economic sanctions and prohibited all Hamas-related financial transactions.

As a result, the international community suspended its international aid to <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians,</b> <b>causing</b> big damage to <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> economy.

Abnaa el-Balad was one of many groups to help organize the Land Day (Yom Al Ard) demonstration on 30 March 1976 as a way of defending Palestinian rights to the land and defying and challenging Israeli land confiscation policies.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Union, {{after long}} {{peering through the}} keyhole of a closed door on what it {{considered}} a Western sphere of influence, now found itself invited over the threshold {{as a friend of}} the Arabs. Shortly after it reopened, the canal was traversed by the first Soviet warships since World War I. The Soviets' burgeoning influence in the Middle East, although it was not to last, included acquiring Mediterranean bases, introducing multipurpose projects, supporting the budding Palestinian liberation movement and penetrating the Arab countries. Nasser claimed to be the defender of <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>cause,</b> but his anti-Israel warlike rhetoric damaged the Palestinians since it convinced a lot of the Israelis to oppose reconciliation with the Palestinians.|$|E

Glazer also says, [...] "Israeli public opinion has maintained that as the Arabs planned to massacre the Jews, when the Jews began winning the war the Arabs fled, fearing the same treatment would be suffered on them." ...|$|R
25|$|The PLO took {{advantage}} of its control of southern Lebanon in order to launch Katyusha rocket attacks at Galilee villages and execute terror attacks on the northern border. At {{the beginning of the}} 1970s the Palestinian terror organizations, headed by the PLO and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine waged an international terror campaign against Israelis, primarily in Europe. In an attempt to publicize <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>cause,</b> frustrated Palestinian guerrilla groups in Lebanon attacked Israeli civilian 'targets' like schools, buses and apartment blocks, with occasional attacks abroad—for example, at embassies or airports—and with the hijacking of airliners. The peak of the Palestinian terrorism wave against Israelis occurred in 1972 and took form in several acts of terrorism, most prominently the Sabena Flight 572 hijacking, the Lod Airport massacre and the Munich massacre.|$|E

Prior to his emigration to Kuwait in 1956 for another teaching job, al-Hout obtained Lebanese citizenship, despite reservations by his father. It was during his brief stay in Kuwait that he met Yasser Arafat and other Palestinian activists. Two years later, after correspondence with Salim al-Lawzi, he returned to Lebanon where he was given the post of chief editor at the Lebanese magazine al-Hawadeth run by al-Lawzi. He soon gained a reputation of being a Nasserist—a supporter of Egyptian president at the time, Gamal Abdel Nasser—journalist.|$|E
25|$|By early 2003, as Israel and the United States {{refused to}} {{negotiate}} with Yasser Arafat, {{it was thought that}} Abbas would be a candidate for the kind of leadership role envisaged by both countries. As {{one of the few remaining}} founding members of Fatah, he had some degree of credibility within <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>cause,</b> and his candidacy was bolstered by the fact that other high-profile Palestinians were for various reasons not suitable (the most notable, Marwan Barghouti, was a prisoner in Israeli jail after having been convicted on charges of being responsible for multiple murders by an Israeli court). Abbas's reputation as a pragmatist garnered him favor with the West and some members of the Palestinian legislature. Under international pressure, on 19 March 2003, Arafat appointed Abbas Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority. According to Gilbert Achcar, the United States imposed Abbas on Arafat, the democratically elected leader, though the majority of Palestinians thought of the former as a Quisling.|$|E

5000|$|While {{still an}} {{undergraduate}} in 1983, Tsujimoto founded the Peace Boat with fellow university students and pacifist activists, such as Makoto Oda, the Representative of Beheiren ("Betonamu ni Heiwa o Shimin Rengo" [...] — Citizens League for Peace in Vietnam). Peace Boat is a grass-roots international friendship organization {{that works to}} promote peace, human rights, equal and sustainable development {{and respect for the}} environment by organizing educational global voyage. With its growing international recognition and support, it attained Special Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. As a Japan-based group it criticizes the Japanese governments silence on its aggressive past; the Peace Boats first voyage was to countries that had been invaded by Japan in World War II and it has consistently worked for reconciliation between Japan and these countries. Its passengers also met Yasser Arafat several times; because of its support for <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>causes,</b> Israel refused <b>the</b> Peace Boat entry into the country in 2002. Tsujimoto also worked in Osaka as a non-profit organization coordinator, and attended the Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 representing an NGO.|$|R

25|$|Palestinians {{have held}} diverse views and {{perceptions}} of the peace process. A key starting point for understanding these views is {{an awareness of the}} differing objectives sought by advocates of <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>cause.</b> 'New Historian' Israeli academic Ilan Pappe says the cause of the conflict from a Palestinian point of view dates back to 1948 with the creation of Israel (rather than Israel’s views of 1967 being the crucial point and the return of occupied territories being central to peace negotiations), and that the conflict has been a fight to bring home refugees to a Palestinian state. Therefore, this for some was the ultimate aim of the peace process, and for groups such as Hamas still is. However Slater says that this ‘maximalist’ view of a destruction of Israel in order to regain Palestinian lands, a view held by Arafat and the PLO initially, has steadily moderated from the late 1960s onwards to a preparedness to negotiate and instead seek a two-state solution. The Oslo Accords demonstrated the recognition of this acceptance by the then Palestinian leadership of the state of Israel’s right to exist in return for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and West Bank. However, there are recurrent themes prevalent throughout peace process negotiations including a feeling that Israel offers too little and a mistrust of its actions and motives. Yet, the demand for the right of return by the Palestinian refugees to Israel has remained a cornerstone of the Palestinian view and has been repeatedly enunciated by Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas who is leading the Palestinian peace effort.|$|E

40|$|The {{stakes are}} very high, {{not just for}} Mr. Yasser Arafat's {{political}} survival but, more important, {{for the future of}} <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians.</b> Mr. Arafat confronts daunting tasks in responding to Hamas' bloody methods and in seizing the political initiative from the seasoned and effective Islamists. In the final analysis and regardless of the brutality of the Israeli military occupation, Hamas and Islamic Jihad have done considerable damage to <b>the</b> legitimate <b>Palestinian</b> <b>cause,</b> internally and externally. Their strategy of establishing a 'balance of terror' with the right-wing government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has been costly to Palestinians and Israelis alike and counterproductive as well. Mr. Sharon feels emboldened with a popular mandate to invade Palestinian-controlled territory and threatens to destroy <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Authority and <b>the</b> prospects for genuine peace. Despite his waning popularity, Mr. Arafat is still viewed as a powerful symbol of Palestinian nationalism and retains a deep residue of support within Palestinian society. He can be most effective by using <b>the</b> symbols of <b>Palestinian</b> nationalism to redefine the political debate less as a zero sum game, as Hamas and Islamic Jihad would like <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> to believe, and more as a give-and-take bargaining process...|$|R
