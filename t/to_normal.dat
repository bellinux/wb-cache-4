40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that insulin and IGF- 1 both increase lumbar sympathetic nerve activity (LSNA) and decrease mean arterial pressure (MAP). We hypothesized that the peripheral responses to insulin and IGF- 1 are mediated, at least in part, via the central nervous system. In this study we determined the effects of the peripheral administration of both insulin and IGF- 1 on cardiovascular dynamics and LSNA following removal of the area postrema (APX), a major site of blood-brain communication. Insulin infusion in normal rats decreased MAP but increased HR and LSNA. When insulin was infused in APX rats it also decreased the MAP but the MAP recovered rapidly and plateaued at a level equivalent <b>to</b> <b>normals</b> after 40 min. Insulin significantly increased the HR and LSNA in the APX rats compared <b>to</b> <b>normals.</b> However, when hypoglycemia was prevented by glucose infusion, the HR and LSNA responses to insulin in the APX rats were similar <b>to</b> <b>normals.</b> IGF- 1 also decreased MAP and to a greater extent in the APX rats compared <b>to</b> <b>normals</b> but the increased LSNA in APX rats was equivalent <b>to</b> <b>normals.</b> The APX rats when compared <b>to</b> <b>normals</b> had a greater sensitivity to insulin-induced hypoglycemia while IGF- 1 decreased the plasma glucose to a lesser degree in APX rats. We conclude that insulin and IGF- 1 entry into the CNS at least via the area postrema does not contribute significantly to the hypotensive response and that the greater depressor response to IGF- 1 is likely due to enhanced vascular sensitivity in APX rats. The increased HR and LSNA following insulin were likely mediated by an increased reflexive response to hypoglycemia...|$|R

5|$|A common neo-creationist {{objection}} to evolution is that evolution does not adhere <b>to</b> <b>normal</b> scientific standards—that {{it is not}} genuinely scientific.

5|$|Across Ulithi, 29homes were destroyed, 64were damaged, and the {{remaining}} 33were intact. Of the 79non-residential structures, only 4were left standing. All four schools and medical buildings were destroyed, with nearly all medical supplies being washed away. Agriculture saw extensive losses with nearly the entire taro crop devastated and more than 75% of the food crop was ruined. Roughly 23% of the coconut trees were destroyed and 45% were damaged. It took approximately two years for the coconut crop to return <b>to</b> <b>normal.</b> Banana and breadfruit trees were temporarily useless, though they were in recoverable statuses.|$|E

5|$|After the storm, {{officials}} in Réunion declared a disaster {{area for the}} island. The government started an emergency relief fund to provide assistance to the affected families. The European Economic Community donated ₣1.42million francs ($222,000 1989USD) due to the storm. Residents on the island assisted each other by providing lodging and donating clothing. France sent 15,000ration kits, 1,500beds and blankets, and 20cisterns to the island {{in the aftermath of}} Firinga. In addition, 400troops and 50vehicles were dispatched from an insular military base in order to assist the affected populations. Within two days, crews in Réunion restored water access to about 20,000people. Conditions returned <b>to</b> <b>normal</b> in northern Réunion within about a day. In the southern portion, however, it took up to four weeks for life to return <b>to</b> <b>normal.</b> The significant amount of flooding damaged the coral reef system due to excessive runoff.
