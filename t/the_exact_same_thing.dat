5000|$|In conclusion, and as {{was pointed}} out by Captain Lanthier, an officer with the Canadian armed forces who served with UNPROFOR from April to November 1993, {{who was able to}} visit many of the villages in the Kiseljak enclave after the hostilities: What had {{happened}} in the Kiseljak pocket is what is known as ethnic cleansing, where deliberately the citizens had been attacked, that is, those citizens of Muslim origin and only them. The others had been left untouched. It wasn't specifically the villages that were attacked but specifically people within the villages. That was what allowed me - that is the conclusion I came to. … In my mind, it was clear, and even more so in retrospect, that the operations that were carried out in the Vitez and Kiseljak pockets constituted ethnic cleansing of the Muslim population living there. They were carried out in the military fashion. The tactics utilised {{and the use of the}} land and all the other factors, which I have already mentioned, indicates quite clearly that situation was not that one day to the next, a farmer decides to exterminate his neighbours, but rather a systematic extermination … When you look at what happened in Vitez two days later, this thing continued in the Kiseljak pocket, and then several days later, in Breza, in this 302nd Brigade, I was told that the same thing was being prepared for Vareš and Stupni Do. And I was told by this brigade that he feared for Stupni Do. History showed later on that <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> was to happen there.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} my design {{is to create}} a look that is simple and easy to wear while still being superbly unique and daring. My {{ultimate}} goal was to create a garment to be worn in a festival setting where there are no rules or boundaries according to dress and personal style. I wanted to create something that would stand out in a crowd and still be wearable and flattering. Process: The process of designing this piece was really quite simple. I knew I wanted to have a basic and flattering silhouette, which I achieved with a slightly flared skirt. But I wanted there to be drama to the piece, which I incorporated with a plunging neckline and low cut back. The drama of my garment is the tie-dyed pattern, which I created by hand. I knew at the beginning of my designing process that I wanted to have something that really stood out and was unique in comparison to anything else that will be seen on the runway. I hope to achieve that with my one-of-a-kind dyed fabric. Techniques: Draping was used to create this garment. Once I completed the drape, I adjusted the pattern to give the skirt a larger flare to achieve more fullness and volume. A challenge I ran into was the absence of a dress form with similar measurements to my model, so I had to rely on the fittings with my model to create a truly custom-fitted garment. This process is more time consuming but it gave the dress a more accurate fit and, thus, an overall more flattering look. Contribution: Tie-dying is not only pretty to look at, but it is a bonding experience between friends and even with oneself, because creating something, especially art, is a soul gratifying experience. I hope to bring personal creativity back into the picture of fashion and show people that you don’t have to have <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>exact</b> <b>thing</b> as <b>the</b> next person in order to be fashionable, but rather be completely and truly yourself. Materials: 100 percent cotton knit, polyester plain weave lining, polyester thread, braided fabric. This is one in a line of three garments; the entire line can be seen at the Apparel, Textiles, and Merchandising spring fashion show, May 30, at 3 : 00 p. m. and 7 : 00 p. m. in Milo Smith Theater in McConnell Hall...|$|R
5000|$|In 1937, Cooley {{started his}} career with the {{forestry}} service. At this point in time the forestry was looking for ways to improve the methods used to fight fires. Terrain in the mountains in the 1930s was almost inaccessible, and the roads almost nonexistent. (Bramwell). The challenge became focused on finding a way to get to the fire quicker. The service came up with an idea on attaching “water bombs” to a plane to drop on the fire. Although the idea was tested several times, it proved ineffective and was cancelled. (NY times) Cooley thought he could do something with the plane and brought up the idea of smokejumping - parachuting out of an airplane into a fire to get it under control. This had been tried and appeared to prove true in other countries including Russia and Germany. (Bramwell) Many American pilots were unsure about the idea of dropping firefighters into a fire from the air. There are many factors that can go wrong and they were reluctant and hesitant at the idea. Cooley and a partner by the name of Rufus Robinson began to toil with the notion.On July 12, 1940, Cooley and Robinson got their chance to test their idea. The twenty-eight-year-old who had been building roads, towers, and various other structures for the service was ready for the challenge. A forest fire had sprung up along Martin Creek in the Naz Perce National Forrest. Robinson jumped first followed by Cooley. (Bushey) Their supplies were dropped on the planes’ next pass. (NY times) The next day when the four-man crew reached them, they had the fire under control. They turned around and hiked the 28 miles back to camp. (Bushey).After the service set up the smokejumpers, Cooley began training other young men on how to do <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> he did. He trained men for what the National Service called “10’o clock men”. The idea was that they could have the fire put out by 10’o clock the next morning after being dispatched. (Bramwell) ...|$|E

To which MØ replied: [...] "that's so true.. My mom actually called me right this moment and said <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing.</b> Wise women". Despite Azalea's response and announcement of their American Music Awards performance, MØ was absent from all the rapper's subsequent live performances of [...] "Beg for It". On 25 November 2014, MØ elaborated on her Saturday Night Live performance, saying, It taught me two things, one of which I already knew: I already knew that technical problems happen and you'll never figure out why, but there's a problem and you dunno what to do… And maybe if I was more trained in doing that kind of thing I could have faked it, but I got confused from the moment I opened my mouth because I couldn't hear my timing so I was just lost. And I'm very bad at looking like I own it if I don't. I don't wanna be that perfect hero that does everything right because I'm not. I always fucking walk into a wall and stuff like that. I'm very clumsy and that's fine.|$|E

[...] According to Staples, “Bobby, our bass player, knew the guy Scott {{who was one of}} the co-writers of that song,” [...] The Gaunga Dyns {{recorded}} the songs on their next single on separate dates later that year with Cosmo Matassa. “Jeb and the engineer and Joe produced the first record,” says Staples. Beau Bremmer sang lead on all four of their Busy-B sides, with Steve Staples adding vocal harmonies. [...] "Clouds Don’t Shine" [...] b/w [...] "No One Cares" [...] was their next Busy-Bee release. [...] “The second record, he let us produce it ourselves,” says Staples, who wrote it after a painful breakup. [...] “My girlfriend at the time, her name was Suzette,” he says. “She was going to break up with me, and she did break up with me.” King’s majestic guitar was key to the track’s power. “He was playing through a Vox Viscount amp and a Maestro Fuzztone, so he had the Vox on distortion and the Maestro on distortion.” “That’s why you had all this overbleeding through cool distortion. It’s like double distortion, is what it actually is. And he was playing a Gibson ES-330. We both had <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing.</b> Well, not the exact same guitar, but the same model. Mine was a little different than his, but he got one because he liked the one that I got.” [...] On the flip side was [...] "No One Cares." [...] According to Staples, “...Mike and I went and wrote that song, and then came back in and we rehearsed it once and recorded it.” And it’s killer because of what Ricky did. He just made that drum solo up. The song is a drum solo. And he made the whole thing up right on the spot. And he went on to play drums with some band—I can’t remember the name of the band, but they were touring in Europe, opening for Steppenwolf in the early ‘70s. And Steppenwolf’s drummer got sick, and they hired Ricky to play drums for both acts on the tour.” ...|$|E
40|$|Celebration of Undergraduate Excellence (2013) Autism and Alexithymia are two {{disorders}} {{characterized by}} deficiencies in interpersonal and emotional processing. For example, {{both of these}} disorders are associated with deficits {{in the ability to}} identify and judge the emotions of others. For diagnosis, patients are typically assessed for such deficiencies using published tests of emotion perception (e. g., the DANVA- 2, the MSCEIT, the PONS) that require one to assess the emotion being displayed by a target person in a photograph or brief film clip. These tests are well known and used often, but it is rare for researchers or clinicians to ever give more than one of them to an individual. Although all three look like they are assessing the same skill, a systematic study of their agreement to show convergent validity has yet to be undertaken. The {{purpose of this study is}} to cross validate three measures of emotion perception ability. High correlations between these tests will increase the confidence researchers and clinicians will have in their validity to assess one’s skill in emotion perception and validate current diagnostic procedures for detecting disorders of interpersonal and emotional processing (e. g., autism or alexithymia). This study had 189 undergraduate psychology students take the PONS, DANVA- 2, and MSCEIT. The PONS features video clips of various facial, body and voice expressions, where participants identify the emotional context. The DANVA- 2 features face and body pictures, as well as voice clips, where participants identify what emotion is expressed. The MSCEIT features face and environmental pictures for emotional quantification by participants. As expected, all three tests of emotion processing skill correlated significantly with each other, thus providing evidence of their general validity. However, an unexpected result was observed as subscales that were most comparable in content (e. g., “reading faces for emotion”) did not show the strongest level of agreement with each other. Specifically, none of three tests subscale for perceiving emotional expressions in faces correlated significantly despite being the subtest that looked the most familiar across tests. This implies each test may be assessing different aspects of emotion processing that have not been recognized by researchers or even the test creators. Until the convergent validity for the subscales of these three tests can be established, the DANVA- 2, MSCEIT, and PONS should not be considered interchangeable. They may be diagnosing aspects of emotional intelligence relevant to disorders such as Autism or Alexithymia, but they are not assessing <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>exact</b> <b>thing...</b>|$|R
