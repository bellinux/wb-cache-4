5|$|Bradman practised batting incessantly {{during his}} youth. He invented his own solo cricket game, using a cricket stump for a bat, and a golf ball. A water tank, {{mounted on a}} curved brick stand, stood on a paved area behind the family home. When hit into the curved brick facing of the stand, the ball rebounded at high speed and varying angles—and Bradman would attempt <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> again. This form of {{practice}} developed his timing and reactions to a high degree. In more formal cricket, he hit his first century {{at the age of}} 12, with an undefeated 115 playing for Bowral Public School against Mittagong High School.|$|E
5|$|Federer {{plays with}} a single-handed backhand, which gives him great variety. He employs the slice, {{occasionally}} {{using it to}} lure his opponent to the net and deliver a passing shot. Federer can also fire topspin winners and possesses a 'flick' backhand with which he can generate pace with his wrist; this is usually used to pass the opponent at the net. His serve is difficult to read because he always uses a similar ball toss, regardless of what type of serve {{he is going to}} hit and where he aims <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it,</b> and turns his back to his opponents during his motion. He is often able to produce big serves on key points during a match. His first serve is typically around 200km/h (125mph); however, he is capable of serving at 220km/h (137mph). Federer is also accomplished at serve and volleying, and employed this tactic frequently in his early career.|$|E

25|$|In World War II, much of Southampton {{was devastated}} by enemy bombing during the blitz. Although the other {{churches in the}} central town, Holyrood and All Saints, were both {{destroyed}} in 1940, St. Michael's escaped with only minor damage, allegedly because the spire {{was used by the}} German bombers as a landmark and their pilots were ordered not <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|By {{virtue of}} winning the 1 vs. 2 game, Jennifer Jones would start the game with hammer, {{and they had the}} right to choose the colour of stones. Jones picked red, giving Saskatchewan yellow. On Jones' first rock, she makes a double take out to sit two. Amber Holland {{attempts}} a freeze on the shot rock, but ends up rolling off of it into the open. This allows Jones the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it,</b> which she does, sticking her rock and scoring three.|$|E
25|$|Warwickshire {{survived a}} scare as a virtual second XI still beat the Cambridge {{students}} by 18 runs. The {{first day at}} Fenner's was ruined by rain, with only 6 overs possible. Warwickshire batted first, losing three wickets for no runs to collapse to 48 for 4, but Jonathan Trott's three-hour 150 not out lifted the visitors to 296 for 6 declared. In reply, Zohail Sharif made an unbeaten fifty as the students {{made their way to}} 109 for 1 in just 24 overs. An overnight declaration from the students was followed by an equalling blazing accumulation of runs from Warwickshire led them to 127 for 1. In the reply, Cambridge came too close for comfort, though, and at 281 for 6 with 34 runs left <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> looked like they could do it - but opening batsman and off spinner Alex Loudon came to the rescue with three wickets for 48, as Cambridge collapsed to 296 all out and lost the match by 18 runs.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the cruiser's signal, Detmers ordered that Kormorans disguise be dropped, for the Dutch flag {{to be replaced by}} the Kriegsmarine ensign, and for the guns and torpedoes to open fire. Accounts disagree on which ship fired first, but agree that both opened fire almost simultaneously. The first shots from Sydney, a full, eight-shell salvo from the main guns, were reported in most accounts to have passed over Kormoran, although some of the Germans said that shells punched through the funnel and the wireless office at bridge level without exploding, and hit the water {{on the far side of}} the raider. One analysis claims that this was either a warning shot just over the superstructure, or an attempt to destroy the raider's bridge as a prelude to capture. With Kormorans opening salvo (which consisted of two shells instead of four because the raider's two centreline guns were slower to decamouflage), the gunnery officer attempted to bracket the cruiser's bridge but failed <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it,</b> with the shells striking other parts of the ship or missing completely. Two torpedoes from Kormorans starboard above-water tubes were launched simultaneously with the raider's attack, and the close proximity of the target allowed the use of the anti-aircraft and close defence guns to rake Sydneys flank, thus preventing the use of the cruiser's secondary weapons.|$|E
25|$|When {{the ball}} was bowled along the ground, the batsman used his curved bat to attack it and try <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> away, usually with the {{intention}} of lofting it over the fielders. There was, as such, no defensive technique other than the most rudimentary and instinctive attempt to stop a ball that had deceived him. The pitched delivery made the curved bat obsolete and the straight bat lent itself to the deployment of a defensive stroke. As the aim of the batsman with a curved bat was to hit the ball over the fielders, low scores were normal. If he did not time his shot correctly, the chances were high that he would miss the ball and be bowled or stumped; or else if he hit it poorly, he would not clear the fielder and be caught out. In addition, the pitches of the time were little more than rough tracks which were to the bowler's advantage. One of the greatest players of the pioneering period was Richard Newland of Slindon and Sussex. In July 1745, he scored 88 for All-England against Kent at the Artillery Ground. It is not absolutely certain that he did this in one innings as it may have been his match total (there is a parallel here with Small in a 1768 match). If it was one innings, it is the highest individual score recorded during the pioneering period and, for its time, was a very high score which could equate in real terms to a modern triple-century.|$|E
25|$|Born 1 October 1900 in Gloucester, Goddard joined Gloucestershire in 1922 as a fast bowler, Goddard {{met with}} so little success in his first six years {{that he was not}} re-engaged by Gloucestershire for 1928. However, {{determined}} to succeed, he joined the ground staff at Lord's and switched to off spin. With his massive hands and steep bounce due to his height (about 190 centimetres or six feet three inches), he was an immediate success and Gloucestershire re-engaged him for 1929. Even on the best of wickets Goddard was able to turn the ball substantially, and when the turf was worn or sticky he could spin to a remarkable degree. He earned a reputation as a voracious appealer, a sworn enemy of batsmen. Owing to his high trajectory, he could be easy <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> (<b>it</b> is estimated he was hit for 70 sixes a season between 1934 and 1938), and it is probable that this is why he was so expensive against the incomparable 1948 Australian side, and in some cases in county cricket. He played only once against Australia (in 1930) and only eight times against all countries – for much of Goddard's time, Hedley Verity was the preferred England spin bowler, and it is often thought that leg spinners rather than off spinners were favoured at this time in Tests. His successes in the matches he played (he did a hat-trick against South Africa in 1938–39) suggests he might have done well with more opportunities. He finished with six hat-tricks, the same as Parker and only one less than the all-time record of seven, held by D. V. P. Wright of Kent.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of his career, Koufax worked with coaches to eliminate his tendency to [...] "tip" [...] pitches (i.e. reveal which pitch was coming due to variations in his wind-up). Late in his career, and especially as his arm problems continued, this variation—usually in the position he held his hands {{at the top of the}} wind-up—became even more pronounced. Good hitters could often predict what pitch was coming, but were still unable <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} evening hours of 1 January 1967 [...] {{along with two}} U.S. Navy vessels, PCF-68 and PCF-71, intercepted a trawler {{attempting}} to land supplies on the Cau Mau Peninsula. After running the trawler aground the PCFs managed <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> with several mortar rounds while Point Gammon kept the trawler illuminated. Several secondary explosions occurred and the trawler disappeared. Investigations later concluded that the trawler could have successfully escaped to a nearby river although heavily damaged.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Journalist Joshua Prager {{published}} {{that the}} Giants secretly learned opponents' finger signals, when several players told the Wall Street Journal that beginning on July 20, 1951, the team used a telescope and buzzer wire {{to steal the}} finger signals of opposing catchers careless enough to leave their signs unprotected. Giants catcher Sal Yvars told Prager that he relayed to Thomson the stolen sign for Branca's fastball. Thomson always insisted {{that he had no}} foreknowledge of Branca's pitch. Branca had been aware of the rumors and was skeptical of Thomson's denial, but later told The New York Times in 2001, [...] "I didn't want to diminish a legendary moment in baseball.

500|$|Trautmann {{excelled at}} shot-stopping, {{particularly}} penalties, saving 60% {{of those he}} faced {{over the course of}} his career. The Manchester United manager Matt Busby mentioned Trautmann's anticipation in his pre-match team talks: [...] "Don't stop to think where you're going <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> with Trautmann. Hit it first and think afterwards. If you look up and work it out he will read your thoughts and stop it." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by the Manchester City forward Neil Young, who recalled that [...] "the only way to beat him with a shot in training was to mis-hit it". As a former handball player, Trautmann was adept at throwing the ball long distances, an attribute he used to start attacking moves, particularly after witnessing the Hungarian goalkeeper Gyula Grosics use such tactics to good effect in Hungary's 6–3 victory over England in 1953.|$|E
500|$|In Scranton, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) sets up Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) on {{a double}} date with her {{neighbor}} Alan (Robert Bagnell), a cartoonist {{for the local}} newspaper.

500|$|Trott {{was able}} to obtain turn from all types of pitches bowling his loopy leg spinners, through varying his pace and flight. He was noted for giving young batsmen a full toss on the leg side, {{allowing}} the batsman <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> to the boundary. [...] The next ball would seem identical, but for a subtle change {{in the position of}} a fielder, resulting in a catch and the comment, [...] "That first ball was to give you confidence, son. [...] The second to teach you a lesson." [...] Warwick Armstrong, a childhood admirer and later team-mate of Trott, said [...] "Trott had an almost uncanny knowledge of batsman who were likely to succumb to his wiles and after he had met with a success, he would at once take himself off and put on some other bowler of a different type." [...] Wisden thought his bowling was [...] "too slow to be effectual against good batsmen" [...] and [...] "that though he may now and then get a wicket, runs are sure to come at the rate of six or eight an over".|$|E

500|$|The next {{international}} {{visitors to}} Australia were the English team of 1924–1925, under the captaincy of Arthur Gilligan. In the First Test at Sydney, Collins opened the batting and scored 114. Batting {{with a young}} Victorian in his début Test, Bill Ponsford, Collins was confident enough to shelter him from the brilliant swing bowling of Maurice Tate. Ponsford went on to make a century (110) on début. Ponsford later said [...] "I was most grateful for Herbie taking [...] until I was settled in. I doubt I would have scored a century but for his selfless approach." [...] In the Second Test at Melbourne, chasing 600, the English pair of Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe batted throughout the third day for an unbroken partnership of 283. Before play commenced the next day, Collins said to his profligate leg spinner, [...] "You're going straight on to get Hobbs if we're to have a chance". The first ball of the day, Mailey bowled a full toss. Collins moved the field, leaving {{a gap in the}} offside field. The next ball was another full toss and Hobbs, looking <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> into the gap, missed it all ends up and was bowled for 154.|$|E

She calls the number, pretends to be the Jamaican dental receptionist, and asks the man to come back to see Dr. Kaplan. At the appointed time, she returns to the dentist's office, but does not recognize anyone there; so she calls the number again. When the man (Michael Sheen) answers, she sees him and hangs up. Unbeknownst to Liz, her number is already listed in his cellphone under [...] "future wife". He calls her back upon seeing she called, and they arrange a date; she learns that his name is Wesley.
