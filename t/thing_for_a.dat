25|$|There {{is another}} game divided into as many parts {{as there are}} months in the year. A table has three pieces on either side; the winner must get all the pieces in a {{straight}} line.

25|$|It's {{a complex}} {{question}} to answer, really. As musicians {{you try to}} find a name for your band that represents you and you never really do, because, basically, names for bands lose their meaning after a while. They become a series of sounds that you associate with people in music. The most important <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> name is that you can imagine forty-thousand people screaming it in unison.|$|E

Three shots were needed to persuade the 3,268 ton Gladys Royle, carrying coal from Cardiff to Buenos Aires, to heave to. Her crew was taken off unharmed, and she was scuttled.|$|E

She adopted her new duties as a wife that took up most of her time, she wrote to her friends telling them that Nicholls was a good and attentive husband, but that she nevertheless felt a kind of holy terror at her new situation.

25|$|During {{this entire}} period, {{there had been}} a {{constant}} stream of Errata, and later Addenda (which amounted to the same <b>thing).</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> long time, {{the vast majority of the}} mail received was from the top few fanatical SFB players, who constantly campaigned for new rules, rules fixes, and rules changes. This became a source of discontent for most of the rest of the players, who did not appreciate a game that changed every few months, and needed a sheaf of notes along with the voluminous rules. However, it was generally believed nearly impossible to repair the damage by properly re-writing and re-integrating such a large and complex system into a new edition before doomsday, especially without bringing the product line to a halt while only new versions of old products were released.|$|E

A posting on the Comedy Central show's blog read: [...] "This was a fascinating look {{behind the scenes of}} the show even for us, and a surprisingly cool <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Presidential candidate to do.

[...] After the visit Dodd campaigned in New Hampshire and Nevada finishing the month at a forums in Las Vegas and Washington, D.C. At the Las Vegas Forum, he discussed health care with the other Democratic candidates and voiced his support for a system of Universal Health Care.

500|$|Shortly after, the Parents Television Council (PTC) {{threatened}} to file indecency complaints with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) against any station that played the song between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. PTC President Tim Winter said [...] "there is no misinterpreting {{the lyrics to}} this song, and it's certainly not about a girl named Amy.

[...] RBR.com reported that [...] "interestingly, Circus was reviewed by Common Sense Media, another organization whose mission is to help parents manage their children's media consumption. It rated it appropriate for age 13 and up, but made no specific mention of 'If U Seek Amy'. Even more interestingly, reputed incoming FCC Chair Julius Genachowski is a founding board member of Common Sense." [...] The threats of the PTC were later extended to cable music channels that played the music video; however, the FCC does not have control over cable.|$|E
500|$|The Diamondback, the university's student newspaper, had criticized Ward {{for moving}} the team into one dormitory, which forced some other {{students}} out.

Ward and his assistants monitored the players' academic performance, enforced class attendance, and placed curfews on perceived troublemakers. Ward stated that, in his first year, only two of his players failed out of the school that he claimed had a history of poor athlete academics. He complained that he was a scapegoat and that there had been poor communication between him and Kehoe. In fact, Penn State head coach Joe Paterno was concerned with the situation surrounding Ward's resignation and {{sent a letter to the}} American Football Coaches Association demanding an investigation. Paterno said:"I don't know who's right or wrong, but...I don't think it's a good <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> squad to fire a coach. As an association, we ought to know what happened.
