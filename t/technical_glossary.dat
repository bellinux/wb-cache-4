Education about the craft and profession {{has always been an}} integral aspect of Farber’s professional life. In his books during this period Natural Beauty (2001) and American Mood (2004) he includes a <b>technical</b> <b>glossary</b> of the locations, camera, film speeds and processing for each photograph, a consistent theme throughout his literary oeuvre. When describing his teaching methods with the magazines Photo Insider and the British Journal of Photography he also emphasizes the unique perspective of every photographer: “I like sharing how I do my work. But even in the exact same settings, no two pictures turn out identically. All photographs reflect the photographer, the technical is just one side.” And further in his introduction to Natural Beauty: “Of course, many powerful images are technically perfect, but that is not what makes them great. If the viewer is taken in by a perfect exposure, then the image lacks what is most important: the soul of its creator. All this translates as sensitivity: sensitivity to the subject, whether it be human or otherwise. A spark in the eyes is not merely a reflection of light, just as a tear is more than a drop of water. You have to feel your subject {{in the same way that}} a dancer has to feel the music.” ...|$|E

Correct translations from English for specific purposes into other languages is crucial in various industries and legal systems.  Inaccurate translations can lead to 'translation asymmetry' or conceptual misunderstandings {{which can lead to}} miscommunication. Many <b>technical</b> <b>glossaries</b> of English translations exist to combat this issue in the medical, judicial, and technological fields.|$|R

40|$|The TermFinder {{project is}} {{a new kind of}} {{collaboration}} between academic specialists/teachers and applied linguists/terminographers in creating specialized online termbanks for pedagogical purposes. Although there are <b>technical</b> <b>glossaries</b> on the internet, their ad hoc definitions do not target the needs of novices in the discipline, or those with limited English. Specialized terminology remains a substantial barrier for tertiary students grappling with the foundation concepts, overshadowed by the recent emphasis on generic skills. TermFinder termbanks are customized for designated courses, and informed by a computerized corpus of lecture materials and reading texts used by the lecturer. The terminographer uses the corpus to identify the key terms by frequency and to source natural examples of their usage: their grammar as well as their technical sense(s) and connections with other terms in the discipline. The methodology is new for terminography (ie the description of terminology), though well established in general lexicography. This corpus-informed terminography is also pedagogically-informed, in that the selection and definitions of terms are reviewed in consultation with disciplinary teaching staff. It ensures that (a) necessary lower frequency terms are included; and (b) the definitions drafted by the terminographer are conceptually adequate for the level of student.

40|$|Until recently, the {{synthesis}} of DNA has been a tedious, time consuming, expensive and experimentally challenging task. But advances in automated instrumentation and improved chemistry have now {{made it possible to}} make any moderate-length sequence of DNA in any quantity. The ease of automated chemical synthesis of DNA has triggered a whole new industry of low-cost DNA suppliers around the globe. The convenience of ordering DNA sequence by mail has opened new avenues in research both in academia and in the healthcare products developed by pharmaceutical companies. At the same time, these advances have made it theoretically possible to synthesize DNA {{that could be used to}} do harm. This article aims to describe the first stages of DNA synthesis, from readily available raw materials to medium-sized segments with a desired sequence (oligonucleotides), and examines whether there are points at which such activities could be, for example, monitored or controlled.

One of the important features of the glossary is its bilingual structure which realization has faced instability of domestic terminology. The avionics, avia- and rocket construction have been chosen as a subject domain for the first stage of the dictionary. The lexical base of the dictionary has been constructed based on the analysis of original professionally focused texts and consultations with experts. The experience accumulated in such a way will save effort to the readers interested in the specified subject domain. Sensible illustrative character of the dictionary will promote increase of adequacy of professional communication of his users. The dictionary has been located on a portal of electronic resources at G. I. Denisenko Scientific and Technical Library by NTUU "KPI" and is available to wide circles of users. First these are teachers of English of the professional direction.

40|$|Main Purpose The {{study is}} {{primarily}} a contribution {{to a question of}} strategy rather than {{the development of a new}} method. It explores the circumstances in which the use of generalized additive models can be recommended. It is thus a contribution to answering the question "When is it a good idea (or not so good an idea) to use GAMs?" Content Following an introductory exposition in which they are compared to generalized linear models, subsequent chapters deal with evidence that could support possible recommendations: 1. A survey of recent studies, in which GAMs have been used and recommended, regarded with greater reserve, or compared to other methods. 2. Original case studies in which the applicability of GAMs is investigated, namely: (a) Receiver operating characteristic curves used in medical diagnostic testing, the associated diagnostic likelihood ratios, and the modelling of the risk score. (b) A study of a possible heat wave effect on mortality in London. (c) Shorter studies, including a study of factors influencing the length of stay in hospital in Queensland, Australia, and a simulation study. 3. Diagnostics, looking in particular at concurvity, and the problems of defining and detecting it. The study ends with recommendations for the use of GAMs, and possible areas for further research.

40|$|This report, Antibiotic {{resistance}} {{threats in}} the United States, 2013 gives a first-ever {{snapshot of the}} burden and threats posed by the antibiotic-resistant germs having {{the most impact on}} human health. Each year in the United States, at least 2 million people become infected with bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics and at least 23, 000 people die each year {{as a direct result of}} these infections. Many more people die from other conditions that were complicated by an antibiotic-resistant infection. Antibiotic-resistant infections can happen anywhere. Data show that most happen in the general community; however, most deaths related to antibiotic resistance happen in healthcare settings such as hospitals and nursing homes. Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2013 is a snapshot of the complex problem of antibiotic resistance today and the potentially catastrophic consequences of inaction. The overriding purpose of this report is to increase awareness of the threat that antibiotic resistance poses and to encourage immediate action to address the threat. This document can serve as a reference for anyone looking for information about antibiotic resistance. It is specifically designed to be accessible to many audiences. For more technical information, references and links are provided. This report covers bacteria causing severe human infections and the antibiotics used to treat those infections. In addition, Candida, a fungus that commonly causes serious illness, especially among hospital patients, is included because it, too, is showing increasing resistance to the drugs used for treatment. When discussing the pathogens included in this report, Candida will be included when referencing 2 ̆ 01 cbacteria 2 ̆ 01 d for simplicity. Also, infections caused by the bacteria Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) are also included in this report. Although C. difficile infections are not yet significantly resistant to the drugs used to treat them, most are directly related to antibiotic use and thousands of Americans are affected each year. Drug resistance related to viruses such as HIV and influenza is not included, nor is drug resistance among parasites such as those that cause malaria. These are important problems but are beyond the scope of this report. The report consists of multiple one or two page summaries of cross-cutting and bacteria-specific antibiotic resistance topics. The first section provides context and an overview of antibiotic resistance in the United States. In addition to giving a national assessment of the most dangerous antibiotic resistance threats, it summarizes what is known about the burden of illness, level of concern, and antibiotics left to defend against these infections. This first section also includes some basic background information, such as fact sheets about antibiotic safety and the harmful impact that resistance can have on high-risk groups, including those with chronic illnesses such as cancer. CDC estimates that in the United States, more than two million people are sickened every year with antibiotic-resistant infections, with at least 23, 000 dying as a result. The estimates are based on conservative assumptions and are likely minimum estimates. They are the best approximations that can be derived from currently available data. Regarding level of concern, CDC has [...] for the first time [...] prioritized bacteria in this report into one of three categories: urgent, serious, and concerning. the second section describes what can be done to combat this growing threat, including information on current CDC initiatives. Four core actions that fight the spread of antibiotic resistance are presented and explained, including 1) preventing infections from occurring and preventing resistant bacteria from spreading, 2) tracking resistant bacteria, 3) improving the use of antibiotics, and 4) promoting the development of new antibiotics and new diagnostic tests for resistant bacteria. The third section provides summaries of each of the bacteria in this report. These summaries can aid in discussions about each bacteria, how to manage infections, and implications for public health. They also highlight the similarities and differences among the many different types of infections. This section also includes information about what groups such as states, communities, doctors, nurses, patients, and CDC can do to combat antibiotic resistance. Preventing the spread of antibiotic resistance can only be achieved with widespread engagement, especially among leaders in clinical medicine, healthcare leadership, agriculture, and public health. Although some people are at greater risk than others, no one can completely avoid the risk of antibiotic-resistant infections. Only through concerted commitment and action will the nation ever be able to succeed in reducing this threat.
