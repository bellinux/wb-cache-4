5|$|Avery {{became the}} first to walk <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> end-to-end, though not as a thru-hike, in 1936. In August 1937, <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> was {{completed}} to Sugarloaf Mountain in Maine, and the ATC shifted its focus toward protecting <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> lands and mapping <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> for hikers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of its journey, <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> follows the ridge line of the Appalachian Mountains, {{crossing}} many of its highest peaks, and running, {{with only a few}} exceptions, almost continuously through wilderness. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> used to traverse many hundreds of miles of private property; currently 99% of <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> is on public land.|$|E
5|$|On July 7, 2016, Alexander was waived by <b>the</b> <b>Trail</b> Blazers. The {{transaction}} was a maneuver {{to create}} salary cap space for Festus Ezeli. After he cleared waivers, <b>the</b> <b>Trail</b> Blazers added him to its NBA Summer League roster.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous wagon train <b>trail</b> was <b>the</b> Oregon <b>Trail</b> which had a span of over 2,000 miles. Other paths {{included}} <b>the</b> Santa Fe <b>Trail,</b> <b>the</b> Chisholm <b>Trail,</b> <b>the</b> California <b>Trail</b> (which split southwestward from <b>the</b> Oregon <b>Trail),</b> <b>the</b> Mormon <b>Trail,</b> and <b>the</b> Old Spanish <b>Trail.</b>|$|R
50|$|Trails in this {{district}} include the Wild Azalea National Recreation <b>Trail,</b> <b>the</b> Claiborne <b>Trails,</b> <b>the</b> Kincaid Lake <b>Trails,</b> <b>the</b> Valentine Lake <b>Trail,</b> <b>the</b> Lamotte Creek <b>Trail,</b> <b>the</b> Ouiski Chitto Creek (sometimes spelled Whiskey Chitto) Recreation <b>Trail</b> and, <b>the</b> Indian Ridge <b>Trail.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Oregon-California <b>Trail,</b> <b>the</b> Mormon <b>Trail,</b> <b>the</b> Pony Express <b>Trail</b> and <b>the</b> Sidney-Deadwood <b>Trail</b> all ran {{near the}} rocks. The pair of rock {{formations}} {{served as a}} landmark along <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> for many pioneers traveling west in the 19th century. Many travelers would stray as much as five miles (8 km) from <b>the</b> Oregon <b>Trail</b> {{just to get a}} glimpse of the rocks.|$|R
5|$|Several shale {{outcrops}} {{are visible}} along <b>the</b> <b>trail,</b> {{with views of}} the Shawangunk Ridge to the west; the skytop tower of the Mohonk Mountain House is visible {{on one of the}} cliffs. Parking for <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> is provided at a municipal lot on Farmers Turnpike in Gardiner. In New Paltz, there are parking lots at the Sojourner Truth park, off Springtown Road, at the Huguenot Historical Society, and at a Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) conference center. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> runs parallel to state routes 208 and 32; there are two park and rides on Route 32, a 63-spot lot in New Paltz, and a 58-spot lot in Rosendale. There are two bicycle shops along <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> in both Gardiner and New Paltz.|$|E
5|$|The {{first route}} through {{this portion of}} Utah was the Old Spanish Trail, a trade route between Santa Fe, New Mexico and Los Angeles, California. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> was in common use before the Mexican-American War in 1848. Although <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> serves a {{different}} route than I-70, they were both intended to connect southern California with points further east. I-70 generally parallels {{the route of the}} Old Spanish Trail west of Crescent Junction. I-15 south of the junction with I-70 also generally parallels <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>trail</b> serves hikers, joggers, bikers, horseback riders, and {{cross-country}} skiers. It {{passes through}} several historic districts, such as Huguenot Street in New Paltz, and the Binnewater Historic District and Snyder Estate in Rosendale. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> also traverses U.S. Route 44 (concurrent with State Route 55), and state routes 299 and 213. Several natural features are visible from clearing along <b>the</b> <b>trail,</b> {{such as the}} Shawangunk Ridge to the west, and the Plattekill Creek between New Paltz and Gardiner. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> passes through dense vegetation, and is frequented by many types of animals and overwintering birds.|$|E
50|$|A {{recent study}} focused on the {{benefits}} of Omaha's trails found that respondents generally perceive <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> to be economic benefits, with almost two-thirds of those surveyed reporting <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> would increase <b>the</b> selling price of their home. There is no widespread concern for safety issues on <b>the</b> <b>trails,</b> as trespassing, theft and vandalism by trail users are relatively infrequent events. A large majority of residents living along <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> think there is a positive relationship between <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> and neighborhood quality of life.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>trails,</b> except Monument Valley Park trails, may be {{used for}} equestrian traffic.

5000|$|The park also {{includes}} hiking <b>trails</b> above <b>the</b> caverns for public use. <b>The</b> longest <b>trail,</b> <b>the</b> Guindani <b>Trail,</b> is 4.2 miles, while <b>the</b> shorter <b>trail,</b> <b>the</b> Foothills Loop <b>Trail,</b> measures 2.5 miles." ...|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>trail,</b> {{like the}} Wallkill Valley Rail Trail to the north, {{is part of}} the former Wallkill Valley Railroad's rail corridor. The land was {{purchased}} by the towns of Montgomery and Shawangunk in 1985 and converted to a public trail. The portion of <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> in Shawangunk was formally opened in 1993 and named after former town supervisor Jesse McHugh. Plans to pave <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> between Walden and Wallkill were discussed since 2001, and the route was finally paved between 2008 and 2009. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> includes an unofficial, unimproved section to the north of Wallkill, and is bounded by NY 52 and NY 208.|$|E
5|$|Anderson's efforts helped spark renewed {{interest}} in <b>the</b> <b>trail,</b> and Avery (who led the charge after Perkins’ death in 1932) {{was able to bring}} other states on board. Upon taking over the ATC, Avery adopted the more practical goal of building a simple hiking trail. He and MacKaye clashed over the ATC's response to a major commercial development along the trail's path; MacKaye left the organization, while Avery was willing to simply reroute <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b> Avery reigned as Chairman of the ATC from 1932 to 1952 (he died that same year).|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>trails</b> are {{designed}} to cover many different landscapes, including farmland, urban areas, and forests. Many of <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> follow railroads. Some of these trails are paved over abandoned railways, while others follow alongside active railroads. Because of road obstacles, <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> themselves sometimes cut off before large cities and highways, and signs are placed throughout the open cities or areas, leading the followers to the next segment of <b>the</b> <b>trails,</b> which, in some cases, can be slightly hazardous.|$|R

5|$|During the 1990s, a {{broadband}} utility {{seeking to}} lay {{fiber optic cable}} paid the town {{to pass through the}} former corridor. The town used part of its payment to pave the route and open it as a public rail trail in 1997. The creation of <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> was supported by a local Rotary club, which built a pavilion along <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b> The pavilion includes a donated antique caboose. While <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> originally ended at Route44–55, it was extended eastward between 2009 and 2010, intersecting Route9W and continuing to the Poughkeepsie Bridge. The extension was paid for by stimulus funding.|$|E
50|$|If an airfoil {{with a sharp}} {{trailing}} edge begins to move with a positive angle of attack through air, the two stagnation points are initially located on the underside near the leading edge and on the topside near <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> edge, just as with the cylinder. As the air passing {{the underside of the}} airfoil reaches <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> edge it must flow around <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> edge and along the topside of the airfoil toward the stagnation point on the topside of the airfoil. Vortex flow occurs at <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> edge and, because the radius of <b>the</b> sharp <b>trailing</b> edge is zero, the speed of the air around <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> edge should be infinitely fast. Though real fluids cannot move at infinite speed, they can move extremely fast. The high airspeed around <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> edge causes strong viscous forces to act on the air adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> edge of <b>the</b> airfoil and the result is that a strong vortex accumulates on the topside of the airfoil, near <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> edge. As <b>the</b> airfoil begins to move it carries this vortex, known as the starting vortex, along with it. Pioneering aerodynamicists were able to photograph starting vortices in liquids to confirm their existence.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an acoustic {{analysis of the}} noise generated at <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> edge of a flat plate encountering low turbulence fluid flow. Experimental measurements were taken in an anechoic wind tunnel using four microphones: one mounted above <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> edge, one below <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> edge, one adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> edge and one above the leading edge. The noise spectra produced by the flat plate were recorded at the four microphone locations. Information about the strength and directivity of <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> edge noise is determined by comparing the four signals. Subtracting the out-of-phase signals at the microphones above and below <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> edge is shown to increase the airfoil self-noise spectra further above that of the ambient noise and is shown {{to be an effective}} signal extraction technique.
