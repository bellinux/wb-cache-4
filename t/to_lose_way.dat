2500|$|The {{complicated}} {{routine of}} restarting went forward smoothly and within twenty minutes Ohio was steaming at sixteen knots again. Then another salvo of bombs hit the ship, shaking every plate, {{and once more}} the engines slowed and stopped. The electric fuel pumps had been broken by the concussion. While the crew desperately tried to reconnect the electrical wires and restart the engines via the auxiliary steam system, the engine-room was filled with black smoke until the engines were properly re-lit. The ship was making alternate black and white smoke and, with oil in the water pipes {{and a loss of}} vacuum in the condenser, Ohio started <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>way</b> slowly, coming to a stop at 10.50 am. The crew abandoned ship, boarding [...] that had come to Ohios aid alongside another destroyer, [...] The latter ship was soon to leave the stricken tanker after being ordered to go in search of the cruiser , which had been crippled by Italian motor torpedo boats.|$|E

50|$|For {{the next}} five minutes, Tappahannock, the key target of the Japanese dive bombers, fought for her life. The first Japanese dive bomber came in from off the port quarter — as the ship was {{swinging}} to starboard to evade the attack — and dropped her bomb abaft the bridge. The oiler shuddered as the explosion sent up a geyser of water higher than the mainmast. Three cane fenders and a Franklin lifebuoy were carried away topside while a fountain of water showered the bridge. Below, thermo overload switches went dead in the machinery spaces, and the oiler began <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
50|$|It {{was back}} <b>to</b> <b>losing</b> <b>ways,</b> however, the {{following}} week. Blackpool travelled to Barnsley and returned empty-handed after a 2-1 reversal. Alex Stuart got the Blackpool goal.|$|R

50|$|The 2008 season saw a new Head Coach Phil de Monte {{take the}} reins from {{outgoing}} Head Coach Russ Seymour. Although the season started out {{well with a}} win, the team soon collapsed back <b>to</b> <b>losing</b> <b>ways.</b> Part way through the season Head Coach de Monte tendered his resignation and Offensive Coordinator Paul Gordon stepped up {{to carry out the}} Head Coach duties {{until the end of the}} season. The team forfeited a fixture to Cornish Sharks on grounds of safety as they lacked a sufficient number of uninjured players to compete effectively. The season ended on a 6-6 draw against Essex Spartans.|$|R

50|$|Wigan Athletic {{had a tough}} season, {{spending}} {{much of it in}} the relegation zone and often in the bottom two. They had eight consecutive losses, between 10 September and 6 November, until earning a draw against fellow strugglers Blackburn Rovers on 19 November. Wigan were rock-bottom from 15 October to 26 November, when winning against Sunderland. They started to improve afterwards, accumulating some points during the Christmas period, but returned <b>to</b> <b>losing</b> <b>ways</b> with four-straight losses, all in January. Once again, after the defeat against Tottenham Hotspur on 31 January, Wigan were bottom in the table. After winning against fellow strugglers Wanderers, Wigan remained bottom on goal difference.|$|R

50|$|The {{music is}} {{expansive}} and discursive, not sticking closely to any pre-determined form. This quality has attracted comment that Paderewski seems <b>to</b> often <b>lose</b> his <b>way,</b> and also overdevelops his themes.|$|R

5000|$|The 1969 Cubs {{broke from}} the gate quickly and {{appeared}} headed for the National League East Division championship but were overtaken by the [...] "Miracle" [...] New York Mets.

50|$|The only {{disincentive}} to Hokianga's exploitation was the harbour bar. Of {{the hundreds}} of ships that successfully negotiated it, the records show that 16 were lost. Most came to grief when leaving fully laden and became caught in the wind shadow cast by South Head where the deep water lay. A temporary lull or change in wind direction could cause a sailing-ship <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> steerage <b>way</b> and be swept onto the rocky shore.|$|R
60|$|So Rollo and the {{policeman}} walked along together.
