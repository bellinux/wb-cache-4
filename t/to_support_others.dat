25|$|Effective caregiving {{requires}} {{knowledge about}} how <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>others,</b> {{as well as}} sufficient cognitive and self-regulatory resources. For example, caregivers {{must be able to}} regulate the negative emotions aroused by witnessing another person in distress. Failure of this emotional regulation may lead the caregiver to become overcome by their personal distress, adopt the role of a needy person rather than the caregiver, or to distance him- or herself from the partner as a way of regulating that distress. Research shows that particularly severe or chronic stressors may overwhelm the caregiver and decrease his/her ability to provide support to the partner. For example, Bolger, Foster, Vinokur, and Ng (1996) found that breast cancer patients who experienced the highest levels of distress in the month immediately following their diagnosis were less likely to receive support from their husbands over the following six months.|$|E
25|$|Evidence from {{research}} on the Christchurch earthquakes reveals that increased trauma exposure is not exclusively correlated with negative outcomes. Those with relatively high exposure to earthquake damage show an increase in positive effects, including an increase in personal strength, growth in social relationships, the bringing of families closer, and realizing what's important in life. It's thought that natural disasters, such as earthquakes, are able to induce these positive effects because they affect an entire community, in comparison to an event that targets only an individual. The damage on a community can lead members to engage in pro-social behaviors which are driven by empathy and desire <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>others</b> who have endured a similar traumatizing experience. Positive effects, such as {{a greater sense of}} community connection, can aide in helping the community heal as a whole. Implemented programs can use this knowledge to help survivors focus on the positive effects, possibly working with families to help them get through the disaster with the people they feel closest with.|$|E
500|$|Vermont, then an unrecognized {{independent}} republic {{that had}} been seeking statehood independent from New York's claims to the territory, became an unexpected beneficiary of the rebellion due to its sheltering of the rebel ringleaders.

[...] He cited Vermont's de facto independence and its ability to cause trouble by providing support to the discontented from neighboring states as reasons, and introduced legislation that broke the impasse between New York and Vermont. [...] Vermonters responded favorably to the overture, publicly pushing Eli Parsons and Luke Day out of the state (but quietly continuing <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>others).</b> [...] After negotiations with New York and the passage of the new constitution, Vermont became the fourteenth state.|$|E
