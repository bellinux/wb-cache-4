25|$|Some non-absorbed carbohydrates, e.g. pectin, gum arabic, {{oligosaccharides}} and resistant starch, are fermented to short-chain {{fatty acids}} (chiefly acetic, propionic and n-butyric), and carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane. The cecal fermentation of 40–50g of complex polysaccharides will yield 400–500mmol total short-chain fatty acids, 240–300mmol acetate, and 80–100mmol of both propionate and butyrate. Almost {{all of these}} short-chain fatty acids will be absorbed from the colon. This means that fecal short-chain fatty acid estimations do not reflect cecal and colonic fermentation, only the efficiency of absorption, {{the ability of the}} fiber residue <b>to</b> <b>sequestrate</b> short-chain fatty acids, and the continued fermentation of fiber around the colon, which presumably will continue until the substrate is exhausted.|$|E

The court considered that Strauss’s frequent absences from his dwelling might be attributed as much to the demands of his occupation as to an intention to avoid payment. In the court’s view, it could not be inferred that Strauss had committed the act of insolvency alleged.|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} carbon {{sequestration}} rights has become topical following the United Nations Convention on Climate Change (United Nations 1992 at page 1414) {{and the subsequent}} Kyoto Protocol (United Nations Climate Change Secretariat 1998) which identified emissions trading {{as one of the}} mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Australian states have responded by creating a legal framework for the recognition of rights to bio-sequestered carbon. There is a lack of uniformity in the approach of each state to the recognition of these rights, which vary from the creation of new and novel interests in land to the adoption of more traditional rights such as a profit a prendre. Rights to bio-sequestered carbon are likely {{to have an impact on}} the utility, marketability, value and financing of rural land holdings. Despite the creation of the legal framework for recognition of rights <b>to</b> <b>sequestrated</b> carbon, there has been a delay in the introduction of a formalised carbon trading scheme in Australia. In the absence of an established carbon market, this paper addresses the applicability of contingent valuation theory to assess the value of bio-sequestered carbon rights to a rural land holder. Limitations and potential controversies associated with this application of contingent valuation theory are also addressed in this paper. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{described}} {{the characteristics of}} the systemic arterial supply of pulmonary sequestration (PS) in an attempt to better distinguish PS from other acquired lesions. METHODS: We identified 25 patients hospitalized at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital during January 2013 to December 2015 with the assistance of medical catalogers. Twenty-three patients with a definite diagnosis of "pulmonary sequestration" clinically or pathologically were included in the study. The medical records, imaging information, and pathological data were reviewed retrospectively. The general characteristics of the patients and the features of the anomalous arteries were summarized. RESULTS: Aberrant arterial supply of PS was found in all 23 (100 %) cases. Among them, twenty patients received surgery, including 14 (70 %) with aberrant arterial supply found before surgery, and the other 6 (30 %) found during surgery. Nineteen (82. 6 %) patients had a single systematic arterial supply, with a median diameter of 8 mm. More than one arterial supplies were found in four (17. 4 %) cases. In 21 (91. 3 %) cases, the anomalous systemic artery originated from the descending thoracic aorta just adjacent <b>to</b> the <b>sequestrated</b> lung which it supplied, without the presence of accompanying bronchi. In twenty (87. 0 %) patients who received the surgical intervention, samples of 12 (85. 7 %) were proved to have elastic vessel walls, out of the 14 samples in which the anomalous systemic arteries were available for analysis. CONCLUSIONS: There are no certain pathology diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of PS. The detecting of the aberrant systematic artery and distinguishing it from the bronchial arteries corresponded to certain lung abnormalities are the keys to the accurate diagnosis of pulmonary sequestration in adult patients. We propose that the characteristic features of the anomalous arteries include: Originating from aorta and its main branches, adjacent <b>to</b> the <b>sequestrated</b> area, directly running into the sequestrated mass without accompanying bronchus branch, being large in diameter, and having elastic vessel wall...|$|R

50|$|Enlargement of the cecum is {{a common}} finding when some dietary fibers are fed and this is now {{believed}} to be normal physiological adjustment. Such an increase {{may be due to}} a number of factors, prolonged cecal residence of the fiber, increased bacterial mass, or increased bacterial end-products.Some non-absorbed carbohydrates, e.g. pectin, gum arabic, oligosaccharides and resistant starch, are fermented to short-chain fatty acids (chiefly acetic, propionic and n-butyric), and carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane. The cecal fermentation of 40-50 g of complex polysaccharides will yield 400-500 mmol total short-chain fatty acids, 240-300 mmol acetate, and 80-100 mmol of both propionate and butyrate. Almost all of these short-chain fatty acids will be absorbed from the colon. This means that fecal short-chain fatty acid estimations do not reflect cecal and colonic fermentation, only the efficiency of absorption, the ability of the fiber residue <b>to</b> <b>sequestrate</b> short-chain fatty acids, and the continued fermentation of fiber around the colon, which presumably will continue until the substrate is exhausted.The production of short-chain fatty acids has several possible actions on the gut mucosa.

Mike Leadbetter, president of the Association of Directors of Social Services, said that many health professionals were [...] "not engaged in child protection". After the inquiry, there was a feeling that senior managers had managed to escape responsibility and that only junior staff members were punished.
