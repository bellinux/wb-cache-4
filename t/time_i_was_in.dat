She later said she had [...] "never really done a proper audition before", and added that [...] "I had such fun , that day actually {{made me want to}} pursue [...] more seriously." [...] Later that year she was cast in her first major film role as Jessica, a dogged student newspaper reporter, in [...] (2003). Although the film was panned by critics, making it was a learning experience for Nichols. She said, [...] "I was a sponge for the entire <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Atlanta [...] and freely admitted that I {{had no idea what was}} going on. I had never done a big film before, I had never been the lead in a film before and any advice anyone wanted to give me, I was more than willing to take." [...] The following year, Nichols played a member of a high school debate team in the independent film Debating Robert Lee (2004) and had a two-episode role in the crime drama television series Line of Fire (2004), which was cancelled after 11 of 13 produced episodes were broadcast. By August 2004, she was cast in supporting roles in the horror films The Amityville Horror (2005) and The Woods (2006).|$|E

[...] Gordon confiscated Jackson's passport, transferred her bank accounts into his name, hired bodyguards to watch La Toya constantly and banned her from speaking to or seeing her family, monitoring her every phone call. La Toya's father Joseph stated in his book The Jacksons that he believed Gordon brainwashed La Toya and made her fearful of her own family. Katherine also believed that La Toya had been brainwashed while Gordon claimed that Katherine had tried to kill her daughter. Sister Janet concurred with her parents saying at the time, [...] "I think this guy who is with her has brainwashed her and made her like this...

2500|$|During an {{interview}} John Stalker, Deputy Chief Constable of Greater Manchester {{in the early}} 1980s and himself a Detective Inspector in 1973, has stated that the depiction of the police [...] "has {{got nothing to do}} with real policing in the 1970s. It could not be more inaccurate in terms of procedure, the way they talk or the way they dress. In all the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the CID in the 1970s I never saw a copper in a leather bomber jacket and I never heard an officer call anyone 'guv'.... Actually, there were a few police officers in London who started to behave like Regan and Carter in The Sweeney, but that was a case of life following art, not the other way round". The journalist who interviewed Stalker, Ray King, remarks that the depiction of the police can be defended if we assume that Sam is indeed in a coma and that we are seeing his imaginary idea of 1973, filtered through 1970s cop shows.|$|E

2500|$|In 1966, Haggard {{recorded}} [...] "I'm a Lonesome Fugitive," [...] {{also written}} by Liz Anderson {{with her husband}} Casey Anderson, which became his first number-one single. When the Andersons presented the song to Haggard, they were unaware of his prison stretch. Bonnie Owens, Haggard's backup singer and then-wife, is quoted by music journalist Daniel Cooper in the liner notes to the 1994 retrospective Down Every Road: [...] "I guess I didn't realize how much the experience at San Quentin did to him, 'cause he {{never talked about it}} all that much.... I could tell he was in a dark mood ... and I said, 'Is everything okay?' And he said, 'I'm really scared.' And I said, 'Why?'

[...] Cooper notes that the news had little effect on Haggard's career: [...] "It's unclear when or where Merle first acknowledged to the public that his prison songs were rooted in personal history, for to his credit, he doesn't seem to have made some big splash announcement. In a May 1967 profile in Music City News, his prison record is never mentioned, but in July 1968, in the very same publication, it's spoken of as if it were common knowledge." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brian Viglione was {{introduced}} to the drums by his father on Christmas Day at age five with his interest quickly deepening at age nine when rock music became a primary focus and passion. A pivotal moment occurred in 1990 when Viglione's father brought him to see The Elvin Jones Jazz Machine and Viglione witnessed his first up-close exposure to the drummer who would become his principal inspiration on the instrument. [...] "I spent every possible hour jamming with my friends up in our attic from the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the fourth grade through when I graduated high school. You could hardly tear us all away from playing!" [...] At sixteen years old, Viglione began playing gigs in clubs with bands around New England before moving from New Hampshire to Boston in 1999. There, he played with several Boston punk bands on both drums and bass guitar. [...] "I knew it was 'now or never' when I moved from my small town to pursue my dream. Both of my parents understood how dedicated I was to making it come true and I was very lucky to have their encouragement through all of the craziness and uncertainty of those times." [...] Viglione played bass for a year in a and was exposed to music that played a large and influential role in his playing. [...] "I was listening to a lot of Tom Waits, Nick Cave, Black Flag, Swans, Miles Davis, Diamanda Galas, The Gun Club, Einstürzende Neubauten, Charles Mingus, and John Coltrane records. Very cathartic music that taught me a lot about the beauty of how to balance using space and aggression in music." ...|$|E

There came a time when her work in the group wasn't fulfilling her wishes", the singer's husband said.

5000|$|Paine is a {{landscape}} painter. He divides his working practice between working directly {{outside in the}} landscape and within the studio. He paints predominately from drawings, completing large oil on canvas works in the studio. Although his paintings are widely recognised for their distinctive figuration, the themes and ideas behind the paintings remain conceptually abstract. [...] I do not {{set out to make}} a ‘picture’ of a tree, instead I want to explore the colour, line, shape and light of a tree. I like to remove myself from a subject in a visual sense and direct observation because when I live with a subject day after day, the ‘realness’ of the subject remains. I can take the abstract qualities as far as I like in any given subject, but if I maintain the ‘realness’ through re-drawing each <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> front of it, the subconscious ‘real’ is always there.

I don't want him to keep his vocal cords, and I don't want to keep my own vocal cords, in incessant vibration all the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> his company. If I go to see a man, it distracts me to have to talk and it distracts me to hear him talking. I can't imagine why one should not go and sit about in people's rooms, without bothering them and without their bothering you to say all these stereotyped things.
