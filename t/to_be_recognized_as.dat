5|$|For the film, Deodato cast several inexperienced actors {{from the}} Actors Studio in New York City. Luca Giorgio Barbareschi and Francesca Ciardi were cast {{in part because}} they were Italian actors who also spoke English. Deodato decided to make the film in English to appeal to a wider {{audience}} and to lend the film credibility. However, he also needed to establish a European nationality so that the film could be more easily distributed among European countries. Under Italian law, for the film <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> Italian, Deodato had to have at least two native Italian-speaking actors to star in the film.|$|E

5|$|Halley was {{the first}} comet <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> periodic. Until the Renaissance, the {{philosophical}} consensus {{on the nature of}} comets, promoted by Aristotle, was that they were disturbances in Earth's atmosphere. This idea was disproved in 1577 by Tycho Brahe, who used parallax measurements to show that comets must lie beyond the Moon. Many were still unconvinced that comets orbited the Sun, and assumed instead that they must follow straight paths through the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|It {{has already}} proven {{difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> having standing when a fix {{is not used}} for a controversial appointment. The courts have dismissed suits contesting the appointments of Justice Hugo Black (Ex parte Levitt, 302 U.S. 633 (1937)) and Judge Abner Mikva (McClure v. Carter, 454 U.S. 1025 (1981)). Black and Mikva were members of Congress (Black of the Senate, Mikva of the House of Representatives) prior to appointment were appointed without a Saxbe fix. In both cases, the courts held that the plaintiff lacked standing to challenge the appointment. Other than these cases, most attempts to gain standing have been considered frivolous lawsuits brought by fringe groups.|$|E

Cavallo brought a number of independent economists to the cabinet, and Menem supported him by replacing Peronist politicians. Both teams complemented each other.

5|$|As deaf {{education}} and sign language research continued to evolve, {{so did the}} perception of ASL. With {{the publication of the}} Dictionary of American Sign Language, ASL began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> a legitimate language. The greater acceptance of ASL as a language led to standardization {{and the development of a}} prestige dialect, which was based upon the signs used at Gallaudet University. Despite this standardization, ASL has regional, distinct accents similar to those of spoken languages. Dialects that are different from the standard one, and especially those spoken by marginalized groups, are often stigmatized. As a non-standard dialect, BASL is stigmatized by signers and considered to be inferior to prestige dialects of ASL. This difference in prestige has led BASL speakers to code switch to a prestige dialect when speaking with different groups of people, despite BASL being mutually intelligible with other dialects of ASL.|$|E
5|$|Charles Sherrington {{published}} his influential 1906 work The Integrative Action of the Nervous System examining {{the function of}} reflexes, evolutionary development {{of the nervous system}}, functional specialisation of the brain, and layout and cellular function of the central nervous system. John Farquhar Fulton, founded the Journal of Neurophysiology and published the first comprehensive textbook on the physiology of the nervous system during 1938. Neuroscience during the twentieth century began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> a distinct unified academic discipline, with David Rioch, Francis O. Schmitt, and Stephen Kuffler playing critical roles in establishing the field. Rioch originated the integration of basic anatomical and physiological research with clinical psychiatry at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, starting in the 1950s. During the same period, Schmitt established the Neuroscience Research Program, an inter-university and international organisation, bringing together biology, medicine, psychological and behavioural sciences. The word neuroscience itself arises from this program.|$|E

5|$|Sheep {{were among}} the first animals to be domesticated by {{humankind}} (although the domestication of dogs may be over 20,000 years earlier); the domestication date is estimated to fall between 11,000 and 9,000 B.C in Mesopotamia. Their wild relatives have several characteristics, such as a relative lack of aggression, a manageable size, early sexual maturity, a social nature, and high reproduction rates, which made them particularly suitable for domestication. Today, Ovis aries is an entirely domesticated animal that is largely dependent on humans for its health and survival. Feral sheep do exist, but exclusively in areas devoid of large predators (usually islands) and not on the scale of feral horses, goats, pigs, or dogs, although some feral populations have remained isolated long enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> distinct breeds.|$|E
5|$|The Marshall Islands and Tuvalu gained National Olympic Committee {{status in}} 2006 and 2007 respectively, and 2008 {{was the first}} games {{in which they were}} {{eligible}} to participate. The states of Serbia and Montenegro, which participated at the 2004 Games jointly as Serbia and Montenegro, competed separately for the first time. The Montenegrin Olympic Committee was accepted as a new National Olympic Committee in 2007. Neighboring Kosovo, however, did not participate. After the declaration of independence in Kosovo, the IOC specified requirements that Kosovo needs to meet before being recognized by the IOC; most notably, it has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> independent by the United Nations. China and the United States had the largest teams, with 639 athletes for China and 596 for the United States.|$|E
5|$|Following their conquest in 1211–1212, {{the cities}} were granted as a fief to Otto de la Roche, Duke of Athens, by Geoffrey I of Villehardouin, Prince of Achaea. The lordship {{remained}} {{in the possession of}} the de la Roche and the Brienne Dukes of Athens even after the conquest of the Duchy of Athens by the Catalan Company in 1311, and the Brienne line continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> Dukes of Athens there. Walter II of Brienne was largely an absentee lord, spending most of his life in his European domains, except for a failed attempt in 1331 to recover Athens from the Catalans. After his death in 1356 the lordship was inherited by his sixth son, Guy of Enghien. Guy took up residence in Greece, and in 1370–1371 Guy and his brothers launched another, also failed, invasion of the Catalan domains. When Guy died in 1376, the lordship then passed to his daughter Maria of Enghien and her Venetian husband Pietro Cornaro, who would also reside there until his death in 1388. The lordship became a de facto Venetian dependency during this period, and shortly after his death, Marie sold the two cities to Venice, where she retired. Before Venice could take possession, Argos was seized by the Despot Theodore I Palaiologos, while his ally, Nerio I Acciaioli seized Nauplia. The latter city was soon captured by Venice, but Argos remained in Byzantine hands until 1394, when it too was handed over to Venice.|$|E
