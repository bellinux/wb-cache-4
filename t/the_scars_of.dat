5|$|To a {{significant}} extent, the royal administration had achieved territorial stability by battening onto minsters. Well might late tenth-century polemicists blame kings of Wessex and their magnates, {{even more than}} the Vikings, for despoiling the Church's resources. <b>The</b> <b>scars</b> <b>of</b> the Viking raids had healed, but the secularization of minsters continued on its slow, consistent course.|$|E
5|$|Kurosawa {{now turned}} to a more {{conventional}} story with Rhapsody in August—the director's first film fully produced in Japan since Dodeskaden over twenty years before—which explored <b>the</b> <b>scars</b> <b>of</b> the nuclear bombing which destroyed Nagasaki {{at the very end}} of World War II. It was adapted from a Kiyoko Murata novel, but the film's references to the Nagasaki bombing came from the director rather than from the book. This was his only movie to include a role for an American movie star: Richard Gere, who plays a small role as the nephew of the elderly heroine. Shooting took place in early 1991, with the film opening on 25 May that year to a largely negative critical reaction, especially in the United States, where the director was accused of promulgating naïvely anti-American sentiments, though Kurosawa rejected these accusations.|$|E

25|$|At 7:15a.m. on 30 June 1908, {{millions}} of trees were felled near the Podkamennaya Tunguska (Stony Tunguska) River in central Siberia in the Tunguska Event.

25|$|Culp's Hill {{became a}} prime tourist {{attraction}} after the battle. It {{was close to}} the town and, unlike most battles in open fields, it was heavily wooded and the extreme firepower took a very visible toll on the trees, some of which were completely sheared off.

25|$|Knock Murton and Kelton Fell bear <b>the</b> <b>scars</b> <b>of</b> mining activity, {{having been}} {{the site of}} {{extensive}} haematite workings. Between 1853 and their closure in 1914 these mines produced anything up to 60,000 tons of ore per year. A railway, the Rowrah and Kelton Fell Line, was built up the valley between the two hills, the line of which can still be traced. A further working, the Croasdale Iron Mine, operated {{to the south of}} Kelton Fell.|$|E
25|$|Today {{the mines}} are all closed, though <b>the</b> <b>scars</b> <b>of</b> mining still {{remain on the}} landscape.

The museum closed in 1991 and the site became a local nature reserve. It was {{declared}} a scheduled monument by English Heritage in 1993. The abandoned subterranean mines are inaccessible, though they still add complications to many building projects and occasionally cause minor tremors, detectable only by specialised equipment.|$|E

25|$|During {{the process}} of {{drafting}} the plan, many residents expressed a desire for a national chain retailer or restaurant to be enticed to locate near or in downtown as a draw. The plan considers this ill-advised and unlikely to happen for several reasons. Chains {{do not like to}} pioneer a new area, instead preferring to cluster with each other, and this leads to the development of large strip malls, impractical and undesirable in downtown Ossining, which still shows <b>the</b> <b>scars</b> <b>of</b> previous demolitions for urban renewal. Ossining as a whole is also geographically undesirable for chains, since not only is it neither affluent enough or accessible enough from major highways, the Hudson River cuts the potential trade area for such stores in half.|$|E
25|$|The North York Moors is {{the only}} source for British jet. It has been mined in the area from prehistoric times but the {{industry}} grew {{in the middle of}} the 19th century in response to a fashion for the jewellery produced from it. In the 1880s cheap imports produced a decline in the industry which was focused on Whitby. The remains of alum quarries are to be found to the north of the area and along the coast. Alum was important to the textile industry because it was used as a mordant or fixative for dyes that were used to colour cloth. The industry thrived in the region from the early 17th century until 1871. Its decline came when chemical dyes were discovered. <b>The</b> <b>scars</b> <b>of</b> industrial activity on the moors make it an interesting area in which to pursue industrial archaeology.|$|E
500|$|A {{byproduct}} of these extraction methods was that {{large amounts of}} gravel, silt, heavy metals, and other pollutants went into streams and rivers.

40|$|Abstract Background Squamous cell {{carcinoma}} of the scrotum is rare and its development in <b>the</b> <b>scar</b> <b>of</b> Fournier's gangrene is still rarer. Case presentation A 65 -year-old gentleman presented with a small non-healing ulcer developing on right hemi-scrotum {{two years after the}} treatment for Fournier's gangrene. On histological examination it was found to be squamous {{cell carcinoma}}. He was successfully managed by surgery in the form of wide local excision and ilio-inguinal lymph node dissection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Conclusions Squamous cell carcinoma can develop in <b>the</b> <b>scar</b> <b>of</b> Fournier's gangrene after a long delay, which differentiates it from other scar carcinomas or Marjolin's ulcer. </p...|$|R

500|$|In {{reviewing}} the first performance for The Independent, Nick Kimberley {{felt that the}} Twice Through the Heart [...] "w <b>the</b> <b>scars</b> <b>of</b> a difficult birth" [...] with Sally Burgess [...] "strain to find specific expression in the sharp angles and steep slides Turnage provided" [...] in a work that Kimberley considered less natural than its relatively quickly written companion piece. For this critic, the instrumental writing came over far more successfully than the vocal part with Kimberley praising the use of colour and finding the [...] "draining" [...] final climax particularly effective. Michael Kennedy, in contrast to Kimberley, found the scena [...] "the more dramatic and musically more inventive" [...] of the two works performed that night.|$|E
500|$|The use of {{anamorphic}} widescreen (rather than shooting full-frame [...] "flat" [...] and cropping later) gave ILM {{no extra}} room to re-frame shots; {{it was a}} challenge to show both nine-foot-tall aliens and smaller humans in the same space. Instead, Guyett said, they shot more areas in case portions of the shots were lost. In filming the gun battle between the cowboys and aliens, in which the aliens move at twice the speed of the humans, actors were required to ride through the scene on horseback and shoot at men in gray suits and three-foot-tall hats; they aimed at faces drawn by Jon Favreau {{on the top of the}} hats. A big challenge for ILM's texture artists was to show the aliens in both a dark cave environment and harsh sunlight. The creatures were rendered in high resolution for close-ups; dirt and wounds were added to the aliens to emphasize the injuries they sustained in battle. After Favreau requested that the aliens experience a very unpleasant biological reaction to being wounded on Earth, the texture team created a yellow fungus-like look on <b>the</b> <b>scars</b> <b>of</b> the aliens. To design the fungus, texture supervisor Martin Murphy searched the Internet for real pictures of mold and growth on trees and eventually designed a [...] "fried egg pattern". The heads of the aliens were based on those of sea turtles, after Favreau encountered sea turtles during a trip to Hawaii.|$|E
