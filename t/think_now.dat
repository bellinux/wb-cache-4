[...] He was listed by Time as one of the 25 Winter Olympians to watch during the games, and he was placed as a 500–1 shot for the gold medal. In the slalom, Nkrumah-Acheampong registered times of 1:09:08 and 1:13:52 in his two runs, resulting in a final position of 47th overall. This was one place behind Azzimani of Morocco.|$|E

Albini later observed the use of studio banter on Surfer Rosa: [...] "It's on their record forever so I <b>think</b> <b>now</b> they are obliged to say that they're ok with it, but I honestly don't know that that idea would've ever come up if I hadn't done it.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Murphy commented {{on the structure of}} the series' first season. [...] "I loved how it began. I loved it in the middle and I loved the end. The only thing really frustrating for me, to be honest with you, is that sometimes people would write this idea that we were making it up as we went along and I wanted to say, 'Really?' But I <b>think</b> <b>now</b> people are writing and saying, 'Oh yeah!' I'm excited for people to see it on DVD, because now that they know how it ended, [...] go back and see all of the little things, like people who have no reflections in mirrors. When you go back, you will see everything was set up." [...] When asked if the House [...] "pulled" [...] the Harmons to it, Murphy responded, [...] "I don't know if they were targeted. I don't think the Internet site had any supernatural pull to it...although that would have been hilarious. I thought it was two things: it was house porn because I think that house really is extraordinary. And also I think there's always that allure in American lives of the fresh start, moving West, starting fresh." ...|$|E
500|$|Bosworth {{was cast}} as {{reporter}} Lois Lane in Bryan Singer's superhero film Superman Returns (2006). She starred {{along with her}} Beyond the Sea co-star Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, as well as newcomer Brandon Routh as Superman. The film was a box office success and received mostly positive reviews. Bosworth's performance however, was not well received among critics; Anthony Lane of The New Yorker noted, [...] "The new Lois Lane, Kate Bosworth, is not a patch on Margot Kidder, or, for that matter, on Teri Hatcher, in the [...]" [...] San Francisco Chronicle film critic Mick LaSalle felt that Bosworth, {{at the age of}} 22 years, was too young to portray Lois Lane, and the climax did not [...] "match the potential of the tiring 154 minute long film". Although Bosworth's performance was ambivalently received, she herself loved the experience of working on the movie. As she told Teen Vogue in August 2006, [...] "You know how you have an experience, a time in your life when you feel you've come into your own? When you grow up a bit, and <b>think,</b> <b>Now</b> I get it? [...] That's how I feel. I feel a little bit more complete." [...] The movie grossed $52million during its opening weekend in North America and went on to earn $391million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Producers of Mad Men {{approached}} January Jones {{to portray}} Betty Draper, Don's {{wife and the}} mother of their two children. Jones avouched that portraying the character would give the audience an opportunity to see a dark side of her nature. She initially auditioned for the role of Peggy Olson, which was later given to fellow cast member Elisabeth Moss. [...] "It got down between Elisabeth Moss and myself, and it was obviously more suited to her, but Matthew had said, you know, there’s this other role, of the wife." [...] Jones signed a seven-year contract with the show, although her character originally had two lines in [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes." [...] Weiner eventually edited the script to accommodate her desires. [...] "It’s such a testament to his ability," [...] Jones stated. [...] "He just took something out of thin air, which makes me <b>think</b> <b>now</b> that he had to have had an idea that the wife was {{going to be part of}} the show, because I kind of took the job with the promise that Betty would be a part of the show. When you sign a seven-year contract, you want to make sure you’re in the show." [...] Christina Hendricks was brought in to play Joan Holloway, the office manager and head of Sterling Cooper's secretarial pool. While Hendricks had previously made recurring appearances on ER before being on Mad Men, her acting career had been largely inactive, and Hendricks' agent urged her not to participate in the project. [...] "They said to me, 'AMC [...] doesn't have any other big shows—why would you do this instead of taking something that's a better bet?' I said, 'Look, I've gone with the one that's the better bet in the past—let's go with the really good script this time.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Burnside {{originally}} planned to cross his army east of Fredericksburg at Skinker's Neck, but an advance movement by Federal gunboats to there was fired upon and drew Early's and D.H. Hill's divisions into that area, a movement spotted by Union balloon observers. Now assuming that Lee had anticipated his plan, Burnside guessed that the Confederates had weakened their left and center to concentrate against him on their right. So {{he decided to}} cross directly at Fredericksburg. On December 9, he wrote to Halleck, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>now</b> the enemy will be more surprised by a crossing immediately in our front than {{any other part of}} the river. ... I'm convinced that a large force of the enemy is now concentrated at Port Royal, its left resting on Fredericksburg, which we hope to turn." [...] In addition to his numerical advantage in troop strength, Burnside also had the advantage of knowing his army could not be attacked effectively. On {{the other side of the}} Rappahannock, 220 artillery pieces had been located on the ridge known as Stafford Heights to prevent Lee's army from mounting any major counterattacks.|$|E

Philip Deignan (...) rode his way to 24th, a time {{that would make him}} lose 3 spots, from fifth to eighth. Cameron Meyer (...) put in a good performance with a time of 50' 20", which translated in a jump from sixth place to third. Michael Rogers (...) then signed what would become the fourth fastest time of the day, saying afterward that the wind played a big role. Being the overall classification leader, Van Garderen rolled off the ramp last, and confirmed his overall ambitions by crushing the stage, registering the only time below 49 minutes (48' 52", 22 seconds faster than Westra). It was Van Garderen's first victory of the year despite some notable results earlier in the season and he declared after the event: [...] "I don't want to count my chickens before they hatch, but I'm ready to win, and I think it's about time.

2500|$|Miller was {{determined}} the production {{not become a}} farce, and in that vein, two keys texts were Lawrence Stone's The Family, Sex and Marriage in England: 1500-1800 and Michael Walzer's The Revolution of the Saints, which he used to help ground his interpretation in recognisably Renaissance-esque societal terms; Petruchio's actions are based on accepted economic, social and religious views of the time, as are Baptista's. In tandem with this interpretation, the song sung {{at the end of}} the play is a musical version of Psalm 128 ("Blessed is everyone that feareth the Lord"), which was often sung in Puritan households at the end of a meal during Shakespeare's own day, and which praised a peaceful family life. Speaking of the addition of the psalm, Miller states [...] "I had to give [...] an explicitly religious format, so people could see it as not just simply the high-jinks of an intolerantly selfish man who was simply destroying a woman to satisfy his own vanity, but a sacramental view of the nature of marriage, whereby this couple had come to love each other by reconciling themselves to the demands of a society which saw obedience as a religious requirement." [...] Along these lines, Miller was also insistent that to interpret the play in light of twentieth century feminism was a flawed approach; [...] "what we <b>think</b> <b>now</b> is really quite beside the point. If everything is done in the light of what we think, it's a sort of historical egocentricity, which is quite intolerable." [...] Diana E. Henderson was unimpressed with this approach, however, writing [...] "it was the perfect production to usher in the neo-conservative 1980s" [...] and [...] "this BBC-TV museum piece unabashedly celebrates the order achieved through female submission." ...|$|E
