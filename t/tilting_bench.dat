50|$|The {{aircraft}} carriage is {{a simple}} frame design with a central canopy attachment, built from bolted aluminium tubing. In flight steering is accomplished via foot pedals that actuate the canopy brakes, creating roll and yaw. On the ground the aircraft has nosewheel steering. The main landing gear incorporates spring rod suspension. The design employs a <b>tilting</b> <b>bench</b> seat to allow the pilot and passenger to see up and backwards to ensure that canopy inflates correctly.|$|E
40|$|A Closed Loop Pulsating Heat Pipe made of {{a copper}} tube bent into a 2 -D {{serpentine}} of 32 parallel channels and filled with FC- 72, has been tested on ground and in micro/hyper gravity conditions during the 58 th ESA Parabolic Flight Campaign. The device has been investigated both in horizontal and in vertical positions and at different heat loads (from 40 to 100 W). Beyond the standard thermal characterization, dynamic investigations have been performed on ground by changing the device orientation at constant heat input levels. Results show that in the vertical position the PHP thermal behavior is strongly affected by the variation of gravity field both on ground and on flight tests. In particular, during a parabolic flight, the first hypergravity period slightly assists the flow motion, while, during microgravity, the device undergoes a sudden temperature increase in the evaporator zone; the following hypergravity phase is then able to bring the PHP back to the previous thermal regime. The PHP in the horizontal position does not show any sensitive thermal variation during the parabola. A further analysis with a <b>tilting</b> <b>bench</b> in the ground lab proves that microgravity thermal behavior {{is comparable to the}} horizontal operation on ground: therefore for capillary closed loop pulsating heat pipes microgravity tests are not strictly necessary for the space application assessmen...|$|E
5000|$|Judge Michael Gableman {{was elected}} with 51% of the vote, {{defeating}} incumbent Justice Louis Butler with 49% of the vote. [...] The heavy spending of outside interest groups in this race, including Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, has inspired some {{to call for}} reforms to Wisconsin election law and the selection of judges. [...] The ascendancy of Michael Gabelman to the <b>bench</b> <b>tilts</b> the Court in a more conservative direction.|$|R
6000|$|... "Next {{day it was}} {{my watch}} on deck from eight to twelve. At breakfast the captain observed, 'It's {{wonderful}} how that smell hangs about the cabin.' About ten, the mate being on the poop, I stepped down on the main-deck for a moment. The carpenter's bench stood abaft the mainmast: I leaned against it sucking at my pipe, and the carpenter, a young chap, came to talk to me. He remarked, 'I think we have done very well, haven't we?' and then I perceived with annoyance the fool was trying to <b>tilt</b> the <b>bench.</b> I said curtly, 'Don't, Chips,' and immediately became aware of a queer sensation, of an absurd delusion,--I seemed somehow {{to be in the}} air. I heard all round me like a pent-up breath released--as if a thousand giants simultaneously had said Phoo!--and felt a dull concussion which made my ribs ache suddenly. No doubt about it--I was in the air, and my body was describing a short parabola. But short as it was, I had the time to think several thoughts in, as far as I can remember, the following order: 'This can't be the carpenter--What is it?--Some accident--Submarine volcano?--Coals, gas!--By Jove! we are being blown up--Everybody's dead--I am falling into the after-hatch--I see fire in it.' ...|$|R
50|$|The {{perspective}} {{from which the}} room is viewed is unusually steep and positions the viewer {{as if he is}} on a lower floor to the Virgin and looking up at her. It has been identified as influenced by van Eyck's Washington Annunciation painted just a few years earlier. The painting contains a number of vanishing points stretching from the lower right hand to the open window serve to emphasise the panel's depth. The steep angle of the panel from the viewer's point of view is achieved through the <b>tilt</b> of the <b>bench,</b> side board, line of the fireplace, and shutters of the window. According to Walther Ingo, the dramatic angle of these elements serves to demote the figure of St Barbara to secondary importance to an examination of the anatomy of the space itself.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{coal-dust}} {{suspended in}} {{the air of the}} hold had glowed dull-red at the moment of the explosion. In the twinkling of an eye, in an infinitesimal fraction of a second since the first <b>tilt</b> of the <b>bench,</b> I was sprawling full length on the cargo. I picked myself up and scrambled out. It was quick like a rebound. The deck was a wilderness of smashed timber, lying crosswise like trees in a wood after a hurricane; an immense curtain of soiled rags waved gently before me--it was the mainsail blown to strips. I thought, The masts will be toppling over directly; and {{to get out of the}} way bolted on all-fours towards the poop-ladder. The first person I saw was Mahon, with eyes like saucers, his mouth open, and the long white hair standing straight on end round his head like a silver halo. He was just about to go down when the sight of the main-deck stirring, heaving up, and changing into splinters before his eyes, petrified him on the top step. I stared at him in unbelief, and he stared at me with a queer kind of shocked curiosity. I did not know that I had no hair, no eyebrows, no eyelashes, that my young moustache was burnt off, that my face was black, one cheek laid open, my nose cut, and my chin bleeding. I had lost my cap, one of my slippers, and my shirt was torn to rags. Of all this I was not aware. I was amazed to see the ship still afloat, the poop-deck whole--and, most of all, to see anybody alive. Also the peace of the sky and the serenity of the sea were distinctly surprising. I suppose I expected to see them convulsed with horror.... Pass the bottle.|$|R
