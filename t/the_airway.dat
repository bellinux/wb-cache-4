5|$|Damage to {{the brain}} (such as from a massive stroke, {{non-penetrating}} head injury, intoxication or poisoning) {{may result in a}} depressed level of consciousness. When this becomes severe to the point of stupor or coma (defined as a score on the Glasgow Coma Scale of less than 8), dynamic collapse of the extrinsic muscles of <b>the</b> <b>airway</b> can obstruct <b>the</b> <b>airway,</b> impeding the free flow of air into the lungs. Furthermore, protective airway reflexes such as coughing and swallowing may be diminished or absent. Tracheal intubation is often required to restore patency (the relative absence of blockage) of <b>the</b> <b>airway</b> and protect the tracheobronchial tree from pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents.|$|E
5|$|Actual or {{impending}} airway obstruction is {{a common}} indication for intubation of the trachea. Life-threatening airway obstruction may occur when a foreign body becomes lodged in the airway; this is especially common in infants and toddlers. Severe blunt or penetrating injury to the face or neck may be accompanied by swelling and an expanding hematoma, or injury to the larynx, trachea or bronchi. Airway obstruction is also common in people who have suffered smoke inhalation or burns within or near <b>the</b> <b>airway</b> or epiglottitis. Sustained generalized seizure activity and angioedema are other common causes of life-threatening airway obstruction which may require tracheal intubation to secure <b>the</b> <b>airway.</b>|$|E
5|$|Diagnostic or {{therapeutic}} {{manipulation of}} <b>the</b> <b>airway</b> (such as bronchoscopy, laser therapy or stenting of the bronchi) may intermittently {{interfere with the}} ability to breathe; intubation may be necessary in such situations.|$|E

5|$|Horses {{are subject}} to equine {{recurrent}} laryngeal neuropathy, a disease of the axons of the recurrent laryngeal nerves. The cause is not known, although a genetic predisposition is suspected. The length of the nerve is a factor since it {{is more common in}} larger horses, and the left side is affected almost exclusively. As the nerve cells die, there is a progressive paralysis of the larynx, causing <b>the</b> <b>airway</b> to collapse. The common presentation is a sound, ranging from a musical whistle to a harsh roar or heaving gasping noise (stertorous), accompanied by worsening performance. The condition is incurable, but surgery can keep <b>the</b> <b>airway</b> open. Experiments with nerve grafts have been tried.|$|E
5|$|Lesions can be transverse, {{occurring}} {{between the}} rings of the trachea, longitudinal or spiral. They may occur along the membranous {{part of the}} trachea, the main bronchi, or both. In 8% of ruptures, lesions are complex, occurring {{in more than one}} location, with more than one type of lesion, or on both of the main bronchi and the trachea. Transverse tears are more common than longitudinal or complex ones. The laceration may completely transect <b>the</b> <b>airway</b> or it may go only partway around. Partial tears that do not go {{all the way around the}} circumference of <b>the</b> <b>airway</b> do not allow a lacerated airway to become completely detached; tears that encircle the whole airway can allow separation to occur. Lacerations may also be classified as complete or incomplete. In an incomplete lesion, a layer of tissue surrounding the bronchus remains intact and can keep the air in <b>the</b> <b>airway,</b> preventing it from leaking into the areas surrounding the airways. Incomplete lacerations may require closer scrutiny to detect and may not be diagnosed right away.|$|E
5|$|Several {{treatments}} can {{be administered}} via bronchoscopy {{for the management}} of airway obstruction or bleeding. If an airway becomes obstructed by cancer growth, options include rigid bronchoscopy, balloon bronchoplasty, stenting, and microdebridement. Laser photosection involves the delivery of laser light inside <b>the</b> <b>airway</b> via a bronchoscope to remove the obstructing tumor.|$|E

5|$|TBI is {{frequently}} difficult to diagnose and treat. Early diagnosis {{is important to}} prevent complications, which include stenosis (narrowing) of <b>the</b> <b>airway,</b> respiratory tract infection, and damage to the lung tissue. Diagnosis involves procedures such as bronchoscopy, radiography, and x-ray computed tomography to visualize the tracheobronchial tree. Signs and symptoms vary based on the location and severity of the injury; they commonly include dyspnea (difficulty breathing), dysphonia (a condition where the voice can be hoarse, weak, or excessively breathy), coughing, and abnormal breath sounds. In the emergency setting, tracheal intubation {{can be used to}} ensure that <b>the</b> <b>airway</b> remains open. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to repair a TBI.|$|E
5|$|Tracheobronchial injury (TBI) is {{damage to}} the tracheobronchial tree (<b>the</b> <b>airway</b> {{structure}} involving the trachea and bronchi). It can result from blunt or penetrating trauma to the neck or chest, inhalation of harmful fumes or smoke, or aspiration of liquids or objects.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of TBI varies {{based on}} the {{location}} and severity of injury and whether the patient is stable or having trouble breathing, but ensuring that <b>the</b> <b>airway</b> is patent so that the patient can breathe is always of paramount importance. Ensuring an open airway and adequate ventilation may be difficult in people with TBI. Intubation, one method to secure <b>the</b> <b>airway,</b> {{may be used to}} bypass a disruption in <b>the</b> <b>airway</b> in order to send air to the lungs. If necessary, a tube can be placed into the uninjured bronchus, and a single lung can be ventilated. If there is a penetrating injury to the neck through which air is escaping, the trachea may be intubated through the wound. Multiple unsuccessful attempts at conventional (direct) laryngoscopy may threaten <b>the</b> <b>airway,</b> so alternative techniques to visualize <b>the</b> <b>airway,</b> such as fiberoptic or video laryngoscopy, may be employed to facilitate tracheal intubation. If the upper trachea is injured, an incision can be made in the trachea (tracheotomy) or the cricothyroid membrane (cricothyrotomy, or cricothyroidotomy) in order to ensure an open airway. However, cricothyrotomy may not be useful if the trachea is lacerated below the site of the artificial airway. Tracheotomy is used sparingly because it can cause complications such as infections and narrowing of the trachea and larynx. When it is impossible to establish a sufficient airway, or when complicated surgery must be performed, cardiopulmonary bypass may be used—blood is pumped out of the body, oxygenated by a machine, and pumped back in. If a pneumothorax occurs, a chest tube may be inserted into the pleural cavity to remove the air.|$|E
50|$|Prevention {{techniques}} {{focuses on}} preventing the tongue from falling back and obstructing <b>the</b> <b>airways,</b> such as head-tilt/chin-lift and jaw-thrust maneuvers, while {{use of the}} recovery position mainly prevents aspiration of things like stomach content or blood. If head-tilt chin-lift and jaw-thrust maneuvers are performed with any objects in <b>the</b> <b>airways</b> it may dislodge them further down <b>the</b> <b>airways</b> and thereby cause more blockage and harder removal.|$|R
40|$|In {{the adult}} lung the {{pulmonary}} arteries run alongside <b>the</b> <b>airways</b> and <b>the</b> pulmonary veins show a similar branching pattern to the arteries, though separated from them. During early fetal development <b>the</b> <b>airways</b> {{act as a}} template for pulmonary blood vessel development in that the vessels form by vasculogenesis around <b>the</b> branching <b>airways.</b> In later lung development the capillary bed is essential for alveolar formation. This paper reviews evidence for the interaction of <b>the</b> <b>airways</b> and blood vessels in both normal and abnormal lung development...|$|R
50|$|Further {{obstruction}} to <b>the</b> <b>airways</b> {{is caused}} by more goblet cells in <b>the</b> small <b>airways.</b> This is typical of chronic bronchitis.|$|R
5|$|Bronchial {{injuries}} {{are divided into}} those that are accompanied by a disruption of the pleura {{and those that are}} not; in the former, air can leak from the hole in <b>the</b> <b>airway</b> and a pneumothorax can form. The latter type is associated with more minor signs; pneumothorax is small if it occurs at all, and although function is lost in the part of the lung supplied by the injured bronchus, unaffected parts of the lungs may be able to compensate.|$|E
5|$|Certain medical {{procedures}} can also injure the airways; these include tracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, and tracheotomy. The {{back of the}} trachea may be damaged during tracheotomy. TBI resulting from tracheal intubation (insertion of a tube into the trachea) is rare, and the mechanism by which it occurs is unclear. However, one likely mechanism involves an endotracheal tube catching in a fold of membrane and tearing it as it is advanced downward through <b>the</b> <b>airway.</b> When an endotracheal tube tears the trachea, it typically does so at the posterior (back) membranous wall. Unlike TBI that results from blunt trauma, most iatrogenic injuries to <b>the</b> <b>airway</b> involve longitudinal tears {{to the back of}} the trachea or tears on the side that pull the membranous part of the trachea away from the cartilage. Excessive pressure from the cuff of an endotracheal tube can reduce blood supply to the tissues of the trachea, leading to ischemia and potentially causing it to become ulcerated, infected, and, later, narrowed.|$|E
5|$|If cancer growth blocks a short {{section of}} bronchus, {{brachytherapy}} (localized radiotherapy) {{may be given}} directly inside <b>the</b> <b>airway</b> to open the passage. Compared to external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy allows a reduction in treatment time and reduced radiation exposure to healthcare staff. Evidence for brachytherapy, however, is less than that for external beam radiotherapy.|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{mechanisms}} whereby recent exposure to cigarette smoke augments the toxicity of common air contaminants: the total pollutant burden is increased, there is cumulative irritation of <b>the</b> <b>airways,</b> pollutants are deposited selectively in <b>the</b> <b>airways,</b> ventilatory patterns are altered, mucus production is increased, ciliary function is depressed, mucosal characteristics are altered, macrophage activity is depressed and specific allergic reactions may occur. In {{the longer term}} adverse changes of form and function may develop in the lining of <b>the</b> <b>airways...</b>|$|R
40|$|SummaryInvasive methods {{involving}} bronchoscopy allow {{identification of}} <b>the</b> site of <b>airway</b> inflammation, although within <b>the</b> peripheral <b>airways</b> further distinctions are difficult. The method of induced sputum refers only to <b>the</b> central <b>airways,</b> and <b>the</b> analysis of exhaled NO to <b>the</b> <b>airways</b> as a whole. Therefore {{there is still}} a need for more refined tools to asses airway inflammation...|$|R
40|$|Substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA), and {{calcitonin}} gene-related peptide (CGRP) have potent proinflammatory {{effects in}} <b>the</b> <b>airways.</b> They are released from sensory nerve endings originating in jugular and dorsal root ganglia. However, the major sensory supply to <b>the</b> <b>airways</b> originates from <b>the</b> nodose ganglion. In this study, we evaluated changes in neuropeptide biosynthesis in <b>the</b> sensory <b>airway</b> innervation of ovalbumin-sensitized and -challenged guinea pigs at the mRNA and peptide level. In <b>the</b> <b>airways,</b> a three- to fourfold increase of SP, NKA, and CGRP, was seen 24 h following allergen challenge. Whereas {{no evidence of}} local tachykinin biosynthesis was found 12 h after challenge, increased levels of preprotachykinin (PPT) -A mRNA (encoding SP and NKA) were found in nodose ganglia. Quantitative in situ hybridization indicated that this increase could {{be accounted for by}} de novo induction of PPT-A mRNA in nodose ganglion neurons. Quantitative immunohistochemistry showed that 24 h after challenge, the number of tachykinin-immunoreactive nodose ganglion neurons had increased by 25 %. Their projection to <b>the</b> <b>airways</b> was shown. Changes in other sensory ganglia innervating <b>the</b> <b>airways</b> were not evident. These findings suggest that an induction of sensory neuropeptides in nodose ganglion neurons is crucially involved in <b>the</b> increase of <b>airway</b> hyperreactivity in <b>the</b> late response to allergen challenge...|$|R
5|$|Some {{forms of}} goitre are {{associated}} with pain, whereas many do not cause any symptoms. Enlarged goitres may extend beyond the normal position of the thyroid gland to below the sternum, around <b>the</b> <b>airway</b> or esophagus. Goitres {{may be associated with}} hyperthyoidism or hypothyroidism, relating to the underlying cause of the goitre. Thyroid function tests may be done to investigate the cause and effects of the goitre. The underlying cause of the goitre may be treated, however many goitres with no associated symptoms are simply monitored.|$|E
5|$|Those {{with severe}} {{encephalopathy}} (stages 3 and 4) {{are at risk}} of obstructing their airway due to decreased protective reflexes such as the gag reflex. This can lead to respiratory arrest. Transferring the person to a higher level of nursing care, such as an intensive care unit, is required and intubation of <b>the</b> <b>airway</b> is often necessary to prevent life-threatening complications (e.g., aspiration or respiratory failure). Placement of a nasogastric tube permits the safe administration of nutrients and medication.|$|E
5|$|Though rare, TBI is {{a serious}} condition; it may cause {{obstruction}} of <b>the</b> <b>airway</b> with resulting life-threatening respiratory insufficiency. Other injuries accompany TBI in about half of cases.

5000|$|Methods {{used for}} {{pulmonary}} hygiene include suctioning of <b>the</b> <b>airways,</b> chest physiotherapy, blow bottles, and nasotracheal suction. [...] Bronchoscopy, {{in which a}} tube is inserted into <b>the</b> <b>airways</b> so that an examiner can view them, can be used therapeutically as part of pulmonary hygiene. Incentive spirometry and use of analgesics (pain medications) that do not inhibit breathing are also parts of pulmonary toilet. [...] Coughing is also important for ridding <b>the</b> <b>airways</b> of secretions, so healthcare providers are careful not to oversedate patients, because that could inhibit coughing. [...] Tracheotomy facilitates pulmonary toilet. Percussion, another method, loosens secretions and allows the cilia of <b>the</b> <b>airways</b> to remove material. Positioning is another method for promoting drainage of secretions; sometimes patients are placed in a prone position to aid in this purpose.|$|R
5|$|Tracheal {{collapse}} {{is caused}} by a weakening of the tracheal rings in the windpipe. It occurs when the rings that normally hold the shape of the windpipe collapse, closing <b>the</b> <b>airway.</b> The symptoms of a collapse include a honking cough that can sound similar to a goose honk, an intolerance to exercise, fainting spells and a cough that is worsened by hot weather, exercise and excitement. The tendency for episodes of tracheal collapse typically increases in frequency and severity as the dog ages.|$|E
5|$|After the trachea {{has been}} intubated, a balloon cuff is {{typically}} inflated {{just above the}} far end of the tube to help secure it in place, to prevent leakage of respiratory gases, and to protect the tracheobronchial tree from receiving undesirable material such as stomach acid. The tube is then secured to the face or neck and connected to a T-piece, anesthesia breathing circuit, bag valve mask device, or a mechanical ventilator. Once there is no longer a need for ventilatory assistance and/or protection of <b>the</b> <b>airway,</b> the tracheal tube is removed; this is referred to as extubation of the trachea (or decannulation, in the case of a surgical airway such as a cricothyrotomy or a tracheotomy).|$|E
5|$|If {{a seizure}} lasts longer than 5minutes {{or if there}} are more than two {{seizures}} in an hour without a return to a normal level of consciousness between them, it is considered a medical emergency known as status epilepticus. This may require medical help to keep <b>the</b> <b>airway</b> open and protected; a nasopharyngeal airway may be useful for this. At home the recommended initial medication for seizure of a long duration is midazolam placed in the mouth. Diazepam may also be used rectally. In hospital, intravenous lorazepam is preferred. If two doses of benzodiazepines are not effective, other medications such as phenytoin are recommended. Convulsive status epilepticus that does not respond to initial treatment typically requires admission to the intensive care unit and treatment with stronger agents such as thiopentone or propofol.|$|E

50|$|Asthma is an obstructive {{lung disease}} where <b>the</b> {{bronchial}} tubes (<b>airways)</b> are extra sensitive (hyperresponsive). <b>The</b> <b>airways</b> become inflamed and produce excess mucus and the muscles around <b>the</b> <b>airways</b> tighten making <b>the</b> <b>airways</b> narrower.
