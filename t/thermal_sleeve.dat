5|$|The bore {{evacuator}} and the gun's <b>thermal</b> <b>sleeve,</b> {{designed to}} regulate {{the temperature of the}} barrel, are made of glass-reinforced plastic, while the barrel has a chrome lining to increase barrel life. Originally the gun had an EFC barrel life of ~1,500 rounds, but with recent advances in propellant technology the average life has increased even further. The gun's recoil mechanism is composed of two hydraulic retarders and a hydropneumatic assembly.|$|E
25|$|M-55S - T-55 {{modernization}} {{developed by}} the STO RAVNE company and engineers of the Israeli company Elbit. Slovenia modernized 30 T-55 tanks in the inventory of its armed forces. The last T-55 was modernized to the M-55S standard in May 1999. The original 100mm tank gun {{was replaced by the}} 105mm one with a <b>thermal</b> <b>sleeve.</b> The armour protection of the tank was improved considerably by attaching Rafael ERA blocks to the hull and the turret. A digital ballistic computer was installed in order to improve the fire control system (FCS). The gunner has the Fotona SGS-55 two-axis stabilized day-and-night sight with an integral laser rangefinder. In addition to the integral optic sight the commander has the Fotona COMTOS-55 sight with an independent line-of-sight stabilization, which allows him to acquire targets and lay the gun independently if required. The driver has the Fotona CODRIS combined day/night observation periscope. The LIRD-1A laser illumination warning receiver was mated with front-mounted IS-6 smoke grenade launchers (of which there are six in two clusters, one per side of the turret) and can be automatically activated in an emergency. Modernization of the V-12 diesel engine resulted in an increase in power from 520hp to 600hp. The running gear has rubber side skirts and the tank was outfitted with new rubber and metal tracks. Improvements were also made to the communications aids.|$|E
25|$|The Leclerc is {{equipped}} with a GIAT (Nexter) CN120-26 120mm smoothbore cannon. This cannon is capable of firing the same NATO standard 120mm rounds as the German Leopard 2 and US M1 Abrams, but in practice only French-produced ammunition is issued. The gun is insulated with a <b>thermal</b> <b>sleeve</b> and has an automatic compressed-air fume extraction system instead of the usual bore evacuator. The Leclerc has a unique autoloading system which was specifically designed for it, and reduces the crew to three by eliminating the human loader. The turret of the Leclerc was designed around the auto-loading system {{in order to avoid the}} problems common to other tanks with an autoloader. The Leclerc autoloader allows a rate of fire of 12 shots per minute and holds 22 rounds of ready ammunition; it can accommodate up to six different types of ammunition at once, although like most autoloader systems it cannot change ammunition types once a round has been loaded. The most common types are the armour piercing fin-stabilised discarding sabot (APFSDS) with a tungsten core and the high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) round. There are 18 other rounds available for reload. A Leclerc tank can fire while traveling at a speed of 50km/h on a target 4,000 metres away. The gun is 52 calibres long instead of the 44 calibres common on most tanks of the Leclerc's generation, giving the rounds a higher muzzle velocity.|$|E

50|$|Between 1983 and 1987, the Centurions had {{a midlife}} {{renovation}} and modification (REMO) done, which included {{among other things}} night vision equipment, targeting systems, laser range finders, improved gun stabilisation, <b>thermal</b> <b>sleeves</b> on the barrel and exhaust pipes and reactive armour developed by the Swedish FFV Ordnance.|$|R
50|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>sleeves</b> were {{originally}} simply insulators. They would prevent ambient {{conditions such as}} bright sunlight or winds from heating or cooling {{one side of a}} barrel more than the other which would cause a thermal distortion (bending or drooping), reducing accuracy. More modern variants contain concentric inner and outer insulating sleeves with a gap in between. Versions have been created which are detachable from a given barrel {{so that they can be}} re-used with a replacement barrel. Proposals exist for types that have advanced external thermal and radar profiles, reducing their thermal and radar signatures making the barrel and thereby the tank harder to detect.|$|R
500|$|Rheinmetall {{introduced}} a larger 130mm tank gun at Eurosatory 2016 in June 2016. [...] Development commenced in 2015, financed entirely using internal funding, {{as a response}} to the Russian introduction of new generation armored vehicles like the T-14 Armata tank, and the first technical demonstrator (TD) was completed in May 2016. [...] The new 130mm gun has an L/51 chrome-lined smoothbore barrel with a vertical sliding breech mechanism, increased chamber volume, no muzzle brake, a <b>thermal</b> <b>sleeve,</b> and a muzzle reference system (MRS) enabling it to be bore sighted on a more regular basis without the crew needing to leave the platform. [...] Compared to the 2700kg 120mm gun, the 130mm has a [...] barrel and an all-up weight of 3000kg including the recoil system.|$|E
2500|$|Fitted with a quick-attachable/detachable Advanced Armament Corporation sound {{suppressor}} with muzzle brake to reduce recoil and jump and audible and visible signature with an available <b>thermal</b> <b>sleeve</b> that reduces mirage effect on heated suppressors.

2500|$|T-55AM was a 1980s {{modernization}} {{of the basic}} T-55 tank. The 144 T-55AM tanks received Czechoslovak-produced [...] "Kladivo" [...] fire control system, <b>thermal</b> <b>sleeve</b> on gun, new mounting for 12,7mm HMG, a laser rangefinder, mounted over the barrel, inside a large rectangular armoured box. Hungarian tanks fitted with BDD add-on armour blocks on the turret front-sides area and glacis (known as the [...] "horse-shoes" [...] or the [...] "Brezhnev's eyebrow" [...] armour). The BDD armour panels consist of armoured steel boxes filled with Penpolyurethane and thin HHS steel plates. The BDD semi-reactive armor adding 120mm of protection against APDS and 200-250mm of protection against HEAT ammunition, thus these tanks had similar protection as early versions of T-72 (similary to the Czech AM2s). The type was partly unsuccessful due to the unreliable Kladico FCS and inadequate mobility (Hungarian vehicles never received new engines). T-55AM tanks were withdrawn from service {{during the early years}} of the 2000s (decade), some scrapped, some mothballed, leaving only a handful of T-72B and T-72M vehicles in active Hungarian army service.|$|E
5000|$|Higher {{pressure}} {{combined with}} higher temperature {{and also a}} higher temperature rise across the core (compared to PWR/BWRs) result in increased mechanical and thermal stresses on vessel materials {{that are difficult to}} solve. A LWR type design, reactor pressure vessel inner wall is cooled by the inlet coolant as a PWR. Outlet coolant nozzles are equipped with <b>thermal</b> <b>sleeves.</b> A pressure-tube design, where the core is divided up into smaller tubes for each fuel channel, has potentially fewer issues here, as smaller diameter tubing can be much thinner than massive single pressure vessels, and the tube can be insulated on the inside with inert ceramic insulation so it can operate at low (calandria water) temperature.|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a review of}} nuclear industry efforts to manage thermal fatigue, flow-accelerated corrosion, and water hammer damage to pressurized water reactor (PWR) feedwater nozzles, piping, and feedrings. The review includes an evaluation of design modifications, operating procedure changes, augmented inspection and monitoring programs, and mitigation, repair and replacement activities. Four actions were taken: (a) review of field experience to identify trends of operating events, (b) review of technical literature, (c) visits to PWR plants and a PWR vendor, and (d) solicitation of information from 8 other countries. Assessment of field experience is that licensees have apparently taken sufficient action to minimize feedwater nozzle cracking caused by thermal fatigue and wall thinning of J-tubes and feedwater piping. Specific industry actions to minimize the wall-thinning in feedrings and <b>thermal</b> <b>sleeves</b> were not found, but visual inspection and necessary repairs are being performed. Assessment of field experience indicates that licensees have taken sufficient action to minimize steam generator water hammer in both top-feed and preheat steam generators. Industry efforts to minimize multiple check valve failures that have allowed backflow of steam from a steam generator and have {{played a major role}} in several steam generator water hammer events were not evaluated. A major finding of this review is that analysis, inspection, monitoring, mitigation, and replacement techniques have been developed for managing thermal fatigue and flow-accelerated corrosion damage to feedwater nozzles, piping, and feedrings. Adequate training and appropriate applications of these techniques would ensure effective management of this damage...|$|R

50|$|The Ariete's main {{armament}} {{is a local}} {{version of}} the smoothbore Rheinmetall 120 mm gun, produced by Oto Melara, autofrettaged and stress-hardened to increase durability over extended periods of firing, allowing the use of APFSDS-T and HEAT ammunition. The gun is also adapted to fire most NATO-standard rounds of the same calibre. It carries 42 rounds, 27 of which are stored in a special magazine inside the hull, {{to the left of}} the driver's station. The remaining ammunition is stored in the rear turret bustle, separated from the crew compartment with an armoured door. The gun barrel has a <b>thermal</b> insulating <b>sleeve</b> and a fume extractor; it is fully stabilized in both azimuth and elevation by an electro-hydraulic drive system.|$|R

50|$|The Challenger 2 is {{equipped}} with a 120 mm 55-calibre long L30A1 tank gun, the successor to the L11 gun used on Chieftain and Challenger 1. The gun is made from high strength electro-slag remelting (ESR) steel with a chromium alloy lining and, like earlier British 120 mm guns, it is insulated by a <b>thermal</b> <b>sleeve.</b> It is fitted with a muzzle reference system and fume extractor, and is controlled by an all-electric control and stabilisation system. The turret has a rotation time of 9 seconds through 360 degrees.|$|E
50|$|A single Challenger 2 {{was fitted}} with the L55 and {{underwent}} trials in January 2006. The smoothbore gun {{is the same}} length as the L30A1, and is fitted with the rifled gun's cradle, <b>thermal</b> <b>sleeve,</b> bore evacuator and muzzle reference system. Early trials apparently revealed that the German tungsten DM53 round was {{more effective than the}} depleted-uranium CHARM 3. The ammunition storage and handling arrangements will need to be changed to cater for the single-piece smoothbore rounds, instead of the separate-loading rifled rounds. In 2006, a figure of £386 million was estimated to fit all Challengers in the British Army with the Rheinmetall 120 mm gun.|$|E
50|$|The {{armament}} {{consists of}} a 105 mm main gun with a rifled, 52-calibre barrel, developed by OTO Melara exclusively for this vehicle. The cannon {{is equipped with a}} <b>thermal</b> <b>sleeve,</b> fume extractor and a semi-automatic breech mechanism and is aimed in both vertical and horizontal axes with an electro-hydraulic drive system. The main gun however is not stabilized. The cannon uses NATO-standard 105 mm ammunition with APDS (1470 m/s muzzle velocity), HEAT (1170 m/s), HESH (730 m/s), incendiary and smoke rounds. Two 7.62 mm machine guns make up the secondary armament: an electrically fired coaxial machine gun slaved to the main cannon and a second gun on an anti-aircraft pintle installed next to the loader's hatch on the turret.|$|E
50|$|The K1A1 {{can easily}} be {{distinguished}} from the K1 by {{the shape of the}} gun, location of the co-axial machinegun, shape of the commander's panoramic sight, and overall angular shape of the turret.

The 120 mm smoothbore gun of K1A1 is thicker than the K1's 105 mm rifled gun and has a thicker <b>thermal</b> <b>sleeve</b> {{a third of the way}} from the base of the gun. The co-axial machinegun on K1A1 is located at a much higher point compared to the K1. The K1A1 also features a somewhat cone-shaped day/night KGPS compared to day-only sight of the K1, which has a plain, tube-like appearance to it.|$|E
