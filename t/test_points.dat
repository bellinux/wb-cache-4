On 27 November 2010 Dan Carter scored a penalty against Wales to pass Jonny Wilkinson's {{previous}} world record of 1,178 points.

5|$|The 1987 World Cup champions were {{coached by}} Sir Brian Lochore who had {{represented}} New Zealand in 25 tests between 1964 and 1971, including 17 as captain. He was knighted in 1999 for his lifetime services to rugby. Four of the 1987 World Cup squad {{that he had}} coached are also inductees in the Hall of Fame. Sir John Kirwan played a total of 63 tests between 1984 and 1994, scoring 35 tries, an All Blacks record at the time. In the 1987 World Cup opener against Italy, Kirwan raced 90 meters to score one of the tries of the tournament. An All Black from 1984 to 1993, Grant Fox was one of New Zealand's greatest point-scorers with 1067 points, including 645 <b>test</b> <b>points.</b> Fox played 46 tests, including the 1987 World Cup final against France. Known as The Iceman, Michael Jones {{was one of the}} greatest open side flankers of all time. Born in Auckland, New Zealand, Jones first played international rugby for Samoa, then for New Zealand, playing 55 tests between 1987 and 1998. Due to his Christian faith, Jones never played rugby on Sundays, resulting in him not playing in the 1991 World Cup semi-final against Australia, and also in him not being picked for the 1995 World Cup squad. The team's captain, David Kirk, was inducted into the World Rugby Hall alongside Lochore; all other World Cup-winning captains through 2007 (minus the already-inducted Australian John Eales) were also enshrined at this ceremony.|$|E

40|$|Golden section search {{strategies}} (GSSS), dichotomous search strategies (DSS), and Z-score strategies (ZSS) {{are simple}} and robust computerized adaptive testing strategies. GSSS, DSS, and {{one version of}} ZSS are similar in that statistical hypothesis testing occurs at each successive <b>testing</b> <b>point</b> in determining the current ability estimates. After each item is administered, the examinee 2 ̆ 7 s obtained score is compared with the expected score at successive <b>testing</b> <b>points.</b> If the examinee 2 ̆ 7 s obtained score does not exceed a confidence interval of an expected score at a <b>testing</b> <b>point,</b> the examinee 2 ̆ 7 s current ability estimate {{is assumed to be}} equal to that of the <b>testing</b> <b>point.</b> Otherwise, a hypothesis testing will be conducted at the next <b>testing</b> <b>point</b> and the process is continued until the examinee 2 ̆ 7 s current ability estimate is determined and the next item is selected. The three strategies differ in the successive <b>testing</b> <b>points</b> 2 ̆ 7 allocation. Each middle point of successive golden search regions is a <b>testing</b> <b>point</b> in GSSS; each middle point of successive dichotomous search regions is a <b>testing</b> <b>point</b> in DSS; each Z-score estimate evaluated at the previous <b>testing</b> <b>point</b> is the next <b>testing</b> <b>point</b> in ZSS. No hypothesis testing is involved in another version of ZSS in which the current ability estimate is the Z-score estimate evaluated at the previous ability estimate. Results of Monte Carlo studies in three hypothetical item pools and one SAT Verbal item pool showed that GSSS, DSS, and ZSS were computationally efficient, precise throughout the ability continuum, and robust against aberrant responses. Optimal measurement occurs using moderate size confidence intervals. Both versions of ZSS measured well under general conditions. GSSS, DSS, and ZSS provided more accurate and efficient ability estimates than did maximum likelihood estimate strategies (MLES) whenever guessing effect existed. GSSS, DSS, and ZSS were more efficient but not more accurate than MLES whenever guessing was not a factor. For GSSS, DSS, and ZSS, there were no differences in measurement accuracy, but occasional differences in measurement efficiency. GSSS, DSS and ZSS were more robust against guessing and inaccuracy of item parameters and took less time to execute than did MLES...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel <b>test</b> <b>point</b> insertion method for pseudorandom built-in self-test (BIST) {{to reduce the}} area overhead. The proposed method replaces dedicated flip-flops for driving control points by existing functional flip-flops. For each control point, candidate functional flip-flops are identified by using logic cone analysis that investigates the path inversion parity, logical distance, and reconvergence from each control point. Four types of new control point structures are introduced based on the logic cone analysis results to avoid degrading the testability. Experimental {{results indicate that the}} proposed method significantly reduces <b>test</b> <b>point</b> area overhead by replacing the dedicated flip-flops and achieves essentially the same fault coverage as conventional <b>test</b> <b>point</b> implementations using dedicated flip-flops driving the control points.

50|$|The {{drawback}} of {{the above}} approach was that we assumed that the sample points are distributed about the center of mass in a spherical manner. Were the distribution to be decidedly non-spherical, for instance ellipsoidal, then we would expect the probability of the <b>test</b> <b>point</b> belonging to the set to depend {{not only on the}} distance from the center of mass, but also on the direction. In those directions where the ellipsoid has a short axis the <b>test</b> <b>point</b> must be closer, while in those where the axis is long the <b>test</b> <b>point</b> can be further away from the center.|$|R
50|$|Putting {{this on a}} {{mathematical}} basis, the ellipsoid that best represents the set's probability distribution can be estimated by building the covariance matrix of the samples.

25|$|The {{two most}} common methods used for testing {{centrifugal}} compressors is to test along lines of constant shaft speed or along lines of constant throttle. If the shaft speed is held constant, <b>test</b> <b>points</b> are taken along a constant speed line by changing throttle positions. In contrast, if a throttle valve is held constant, <b>test</b> <b>points</b> are established by changing speed (common gas turbine practice). The map shown in Figure 5.2 illustrate {{the most common}} method; lines of constant speed. In this case we see data points connected via straight lines at speeds of 50%, 71%, 87%, and 100% RPM.

40|$|In {{supervised}} learning problems, global and local learning algorithms are used.

50|$|However, we {{also need}} to know if the set is spread out over a large range or a small range, so that we can decide whether a given {{distance}} from the center is noteworthy or not. The simplistic approach is to estimate the standard deviation of the distances of the sample points from the center of mass. If the distance between the <b>test</b> <b>point</b> and the center of mass is less than one standard deviation, then we might conclude that it is highly probable that the <b>test</b> <b>point</b> belongs to the set. The further away it is, the more likely that the <b>test</b> <b>point</b> should not be classified as belonging to the set.|$|R

This prediction is based on a statistical regression based mapping of the test response waveform to the specifications of the circuit under test.
