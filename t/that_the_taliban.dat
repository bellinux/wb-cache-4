5|$|The {{day after}} the shooting, Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> gunman who shot Yousafzai had been identified.

50|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> {{allegedly}} makes Afghanistan's opium business easy, offering credit, {{seeds and}} fertilizer to farmers to grow <b>the</b> drugs <b>that</b> fuel <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> insurgency, <b>the</b> US authorities {{are determined to}} change that momentum by offering similar incentives to steer farmers away from the drug trade and toward alternative, legitimate crops, like grapes, wheat and saffron.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the initial}} success in driving the Taliban from power in Kabul, by early 2003 the Taliban was regrouping, {{amassing}} new funds and recruits. The 2005 failure of Operation Red Wings showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> had returned. In 2006, the Taliban insurgency appeared larger, fiercer and better organized than expected, with large-scale allied offensives such as Operation Mountain Thrust attaining limited success. As a result, Bush commissioned 3,500 additional {{troops to the}} country in March 2007.|$|E
25|$|On February 8, 2009, U.S. {{commander}} of operations in Afghanistan General Stanley McChrystal {{and other officials}} said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> leadership was in Quetta, Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|While UN, American and Afghan {{officials}} quickly {{hailed the}} election as a success, evidence from observers {{on the ground}} and from journalists suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> had succeeded in deterring many Afghans from voting.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Taliban</b> {{are not a}} {{force to}} be {{considered}} invincible. They are distanced from the people now. They are weaker than in the past. There is only the assistance given by Pakistan, Osama bin Laden and other extremist groups <b>that</b> keep <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> on their feet. With a halt to that assistance, it is extremely difficult to survive.|$|R
3000|$|Then when <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> collapsed, <b>the</b> Holland {{government}} {{sent some}} people to me, saying <b>that</b> now <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> is not a threat.

25|$|By {{the end of}} 2008, {{some sources}} {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> had severed any remaining ties with al-Qaeda, while others cast doubt on this.

25|$|Abdul Haq, who {{was killed}} by the Taliban on October 26, 2001, enjoying strong popular support among Afghanistan's Pashtuns, wanted to create and support a popular {{uprising}} against the Taliban - also dominantly Pashtuns - among the Pashtuns.

25|$|He {{asserted}} that the Derunta camp was a non-al Qaeda camp, that dated back to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, that it was originally run by the Hezbi Islami, and that after his attendance there the Derunta camp {{was one of the}} many non-al Qaeda camps <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> shut down at al Qaeda's request.|$|E

25|$|On 5 April 2007, when {{commenting on}} the {{kidnapping}} of two Frenchmen by the Taliban in Afghanistan, Royal called for sanctions to be imposed by the United Nations against regimes like the Taliban. This comment was widely interpreted as indicating that Royal did not understand <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> no longer formed the Afghan government {{and that she was}} clueless on international matters.|$|E
25|$|On July 23, 2007, Dahle became {{subject to}} media {{attention}} {{when he said}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> and other Afghan rebels had the full right to fight Norwegian soldiers stationed in Afghanistan. The attention occurred only days later {{with the death of}} a Norwegian army officer in the Logar Province as a Norwegian military unit came under hostile fire. Dahle later replied to the criticism, saying that he did not support the death of Norwegian military personnel.|$|E
25|$|In August 2008, the Taliban began {{operating}} {{closer to}} the provincial capital of Lashkar Gah, attacking government positions in Marja (town) and Nad Ali Districts, just 10 kilometers from the city. The local authorities were at first reluctant {{to call for help}} from ISAF forces, for fear their intervention might cause civilian casualties. In September, after both districts had fallen to the Taliban, British Army officials said these setbacks were caused by the defection of pro-government militias linked to local drug-trafficking mafias, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> had promised to protect from poppy-eradication programs.|$|E
50|$|On 4 October, Taliban fighters {{claimed to}} have recaptured the {{majority}} of Kunduz.

According to a police spokesperson, while <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> still threatened, their primary battle line had been broken.|$|R
50|$|When night fell, <b>the</b> {{surviving}} <b>Taliban</b> halted <b>the</b> {{attack and}} attempted to retire from the battlefield.

Witnesses stated that each land-owning family had to provide one young man and $500 in expenses. In August of that year 5000 students aged between 15 and 35 left madrassas in Pakistan to join <b>the</b> <b>Taliban.</b>|$|R

As {{a result of its}} Northerly {{situation}} it is unlikely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> were involved. The gunman attacked the soft-skinned 4x4 vehicle that the soldiers were travelling in, the vehicle was situated just a few hundred yards from the famous blue mosque. The gunman was arrested straight after the incident and has since been charged and jailed for the murder of LCpl Sherwood.|$|E

Lastay Kulang ended on June 14, with the strategic outcome unclear. NATO stated that their forces cleared Sangin and Gereshk of Taliban and thus secured the Kajaki District. In contrast, the Taliban claimed that they still control much of Kajaki, and some of the Sangin districts. These claims were confirmed by the local residents, who complain <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> returned as soon as NATO and ANA troops had left.|$|E

25|$|In {{the wake}} of recent {{terrorist}} attacks in India, there have been growing concerns about fundamentalist organisations such as the Taliban seeking to expand their activities into India. During the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup which was co-hosted in India, Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik and Interpol chief Ronald Noble revealed that a terrorist bid to disrupt the tournament had been foiled; following a conference with Noble, Malik said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> had begun to base their activities in India with reports from neighboring countries exposing their activities {{in the country and}} a Sri Lankan terrorist planning to target cricketers was arrested in Colombo. In 2009, the Times of India called for India to reassess its Taliban threat.|$|E
25|$|When the Taliban {{emerged in}} the mid-1990s, Karzai {{initially}} recognized them as a legitimate government because he thought that they would stop the violence and corruption in his country. He was requested by the Taliban to serve as their ambassador but he refused, telling friends that he felt Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) was wrongly using them. He lived in the Pakistani city of Quetta among the Afghan refugees, where he worked to reinstate former Afghan King Zahir Shah. In July 1999, Karzai's father, Abdul Ahad Karzai, was gunned down {{early in the morning}} while coming home from a mosque in the city of Quetta. Reports suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> carried out the assassination. Following this incident, Karzai decided to work closely with the Northern Alliance, which was led by Ahmad Shah Massoud.|$|E
25|$|After seizing Garmsir, the Marines pushed {{further south}} {{into an area}} where the insurgents had built bunkers and tunnels capable of {{withstanding}} coalition airstrikes. They ran into stiff resistance and the operation, expected to take a few days, lasted more than a month to complete. This alerted the ISAF commander that the town was important to the insurgents, so he ordered the Marines to remain in the area, rather than clear the town and leave. He was also concerned <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> would emerge after the Marines left, falsely claiming that they had run ISAF forces off. With the original mission changed, the Marines transitioned from combat operations to civil operations. The 24th MEU commander Colonel Peter Petronzio focused on protecting the local Afghans as they began {{to return to their homes}} after having been displaced by the Taliban. The Marines also continued their combat operations in the area, killing more than 400 insurgents between April and July 2008, according to governor Gulab Mangal.|$|E
50|$|On 5 June 2017, {{a quartet}} {{composed}} of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic ties with Qatar. The main reason cited for the severing of links was Qatar's alleged financing and hosting of Islamic extremist groups, including <b>the</b> <b>Taliban.</b> In response, a Qatari government official denied <b>that</b> Qatar supported <b>the</b> <b>Taliban,</b> and claimed <b>that</b> they hosted <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> after being requested {{to do so}} by the US government. On 31 July 2017, hacked emails of the UAE ambassador to Washington, Yousef Al Otaiba, revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> UAE, a member of the quartet, had lobbied the US to appoint <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> office in Abu Dhabi. Qatar's selection to host the office over the UAE reportedly angered Emirati officials. Ambassador Otaiba has denounced Qatar's hosting of Taliban officials, mentioning it as one of the quartet's reasons for cutting ties with Qatar.|$|R
