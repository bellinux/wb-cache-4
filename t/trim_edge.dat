40|$|Nowadays, most of {{the tools}} of Volvo Cars Body Components (VCBC) in Olofström are {{hardened}} by flame hardening or induction hardening process. Indeed, VCBC has developed their own equipment for flame and induction hardening: However, Volvo has detected that 74 % of {{the total cost of}} one year maintenance was caused by trim dies and the main reason is actually <b>trim</b> <b>edge</b> problems which represent 26 % of year maintenance. This is why the R&D Forming &amp; Material department is investigating some ways to reduce those excessive costs caused by cutting tools. As a consequence, in this project, we will study the laser hardening of cutting tools. The aims of this project were to investigate: * The laser hardening process * The limits of different tool materials with this laser process This master thesis should give a beginning of answer to the following question: Is the laser hardening process a suitable alternative to induction hardening process for trim dies at VCBC ? This work has been conducted at Volvo Cars Body Components in the R&D Forming &amp; Material department. This report is divided in four main parts. The two first parts deal with theories about laser and selective hardening processes. The two last ones are the report of my experimental investigation that I run during the thesis at VCBC in Olofström. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|Dual-Phase (DP) steels, part of {{the group}} of Advanced High Strength Steels (AHSS), are used by car {{manufactures}} due to its large strength to weight ratio. The high strength of the DP steel does {{have a negative impact on}} the formability during sheet metal forming and stretch forming, e. g. fractures often appear in shear cut edges during forming of blanks made of DP steel.   The main objective with this thesis is to develop a new punch for Volvo Cars that concentrates the strain to the sheared edges of a test specimen made from different types of DP steel. This is done to be able to measure and obtain maximum fracture strain during stretch forming tests in a press. The newly developed test method is called CTEST (Concentrated <b>Trim</b> <b>Edge</b> Strain Test).   The tests are performed with DP steel specimens with three different qualities of the shear cut edges; fine cut, medium cut and worn cut. DP steels tested are DP 600 GI, DP 600 UC and DP 800 GI from three different suppliers. 10 different types of DP steels are tested in this study with different thickness. Thickness of specimens tested are 1 mm, 1. 1 mm, 1. 5 mm and 2 mm and all specimens tested have a lengthwise (RD) rolling direction.   The quality of the sheared cut edge has a great impact to the formability and maximum fracture strain of the specimen. A specimen with a fine cut endures higher fracture strain than medium cut and a worn cut for all types of DP steel with different thickness. A 1 mm thick specimen endures a lower fracture strain than 1. 5 mm and 2 mm specimen for all cut qualities.   Further, the impact of the orientation of the burr zone of a shear cut edge is studied. With the burr zone facing upwards from the CTEST punch the formability of the specimens is decreased compared to a burr zone facing downwards, especially for a worn cut specimen with micro cracks and imperfections in the edge surface.   ARAMIS Digital Image Correlation (DIC) system is used to analyze the specimen edges during press experiments. The ARAMIS results unveil that several small fractures appear in the sheared edges of a specimen just before the specimens split into two pieces. This phenomenon was seen for specimen with worn and medium shear cut qualities.   Finite Element (FE) simulations of the CTEST is performed in AutoForm to determine maximum values of the true strain for the three different cut qualities. The simulation in AutoForm does show a slightly higher value of the force and press depth than the value from the press test before maximum fracture strain in reached. The small fractures seen in ARAMIS just before the specimen split into two pieces cannot be seen in the simulation in AutoForm...|$|E

40|$|Carbon fiber {{reinforced}} polymers (CFRPs) {{have found}} wide-ranging applications in numerous industrial {{fields such as}} aerospace, automotive, and shipping industries due to their excellent mechanical properties that lead to enhanced functional performance. In this paper, an experimental study on <b>edge</b> <b>trimming</b> of CFRP was done with various cutting conditions and different geometry of tools such as helical-, fluted-, and burr-type tools. The investigation involves the measurement of cutting forces for the different machining conditions {{and its effect on}} the surface quality of the <b>trimmed</b> <b>edges.</b> The modern cutting tools (router tools or burr tools) selected for machining CFRPs, have complex geometries in cutting edges and surfaces, and therefore a traditional method of direct tool wear evaluation is not applicable. An acoustic emission (AE) sensing was employed for on-line monitoring of the performance of router tools to determine the relationship between AE signal and length of machining for different kinds of geometry of tools. The investigation showed that the router tool with a flat cutting edge has better performance by generating lower cutting force and better surface finish with no delamination on <b>trimmed</b> <b>edges.</b> The mathematical modeling for the prediction of cutting forces was also done using Artificial Neural Network and Regression Analysis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} a novel {{approach}} towards automation of robotized laser metal-wire deposition (RLMwD) is described. The RLMwD technique is being developed at University West in cooperation with Swedish industry for solid freeform fabrication of fully dense metal structures. The process utilizes robotized fiber laser welding and metal wire filler material, together with a layered manufacturing method, to create metal structures directly from a CAD drawing. The RLMwD process {{can also be used}} for repair or modification of existing components. This paper faces the challenge of designing a control system for maintaining stable process variables, such as a constant layer height and a stable component temperature, during the entire manufacturing process. Several problems are identified and discussed in the paper, e. g. the difficulty of obtaining the bead height in the weld pool environment. The case study is a repair application for stamping tools, where worn out <b>trim</b> <b>edges</b> are to be repaired. Issues regarding the control design, system identification, and the practical implementation of this application are discussed...|$|R
