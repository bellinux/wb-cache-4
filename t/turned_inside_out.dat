25|$|Richard Griffin {{was born}} August 31, 1916. He was a 29-year-old war veteran who was {{discharged}} from the Seabees in November 1945. He was a carpenter and painter and handled his own contracting. He was living with his mother, Mrs. R. H. Griffin, at 155 Robison Courts which was built for servicemen returning from World War II and has since been demolished. Griffin attended school in Linden, Texas and Union Chapel, Cass County. He was last seen alive around 10 p.m. on Saturday, March 23, in a West 7th street (US Highway 67 West) cafe with his sister, Eleanor, and her boyfriend J. A. Proctor. He was also seen earlier at another West 7th street cafe by friends around 2 p.m. He was found fully clothed on his knees between the front seats of his 1941 Oldsmobile sedan with his pockets <b>turned</b> <b>inside</b> <b>out</b> and his head resting on his crossed hands.

25|$|Judenplatz (English:Jewish Square) is a {{town square}} in Vienna's Innere Stadt that {{was the center of}} Jewish life and the Viennese Jewish Community in the Middle Ages. It is located in the {{immediate}} proximity of Am Hof square, Schulhof, and Wipplingerstraße. It exemplifies the long and eventful history {{of the city and the}} Jewish community focused on this place. Archaeological excavations of the medieval synagogue are viewable underground by way of the museum on the square, Misrachi-Haus. Two sculptural works, a carved relief and several inscribed texts are located around the square that all have subject matter relating to Jewish history. One of these sculptures is a statue of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. The other is a memorial to Austrian Holocaust Victims, a project based on an idea of Simon Wiesenthal and unveiled in 2000. Created by British artist Rachel Whiteread, the memorial is a reinforced concrete cube resembling a library with its volumes <b>turned</b> <b>inside</b> <b>out.</b> The Judenplatz is the location of the Constitutional Court of Austria and the Administrative Court of Austria.|$|E
25|$|Children's {{clothing}} (mikelnguut aturait) {{was made}} of soft skin of younger animals. Reindeer fawn and dog puppy skin parkas, with the fur inside, were made for babies (irniaq) and small children (mikelnguq). Puppies one and two months old were killed for the purpose. Fawn and puppy skins were <b>turned</b> <b>inside</b> <b>out,</b> scraped, hung out to dry, and then put away. When needed the skins were taken from storage, rubbed between the hands with a rotary motion, and chewed as necessary to soften and loosen tissue that had not previously been removed. For a sealskin parka, one skin was required for a three-year-old, two for a five- or six-year-old, and three for a child of 10 or 12 years. A small child's sealskin parka was often decorated with tassels of the same material stitched to the upper center of the back. A baby's boots were always made with the fur inside but otherwise were similar in construction to adult boots. In former times, babies wore long boots and no pants. When a child was toilet trained, pants separate from boots were put on a boy, while girls were given trouser-boots like those worn by women.|$|E

25|$|Black bear {{predation}} {{on adult}} deer is rare {{but has been}} recorded. They may even hunt prey up {{to the size of}} adult female moose, which are considerably larger than themselves, by ambushing them. There is at least one record of a male black bear killing two bull elk over the course of six days by chasing them into deep snow banks where their movement is impeded. In Labrador, black bears are exceptionally carnivorous, living largely off caribou, usually sickly, young or dead specimens, and rodents such as voles. This is believed to be due to a paucity of edible plant life in this sub-Arctic region and a local lack of competing large carnivores (including other bear species). Like brown bears, black bears try to use surprise to ambush their prey and target the sickly animals in herds. Once a deer fawn is captured, it is frequently torn apart alive while feeding. If able to capture a mother deer in spring, the bear frequently begins feeding on the udder of lactating females, but generally prefers meat from the viscera. Black bears often drag their prey to cover, preferring to feed in seclusion. The skin of large prey is stripped back and <b>turned</b> <b>inside</b> <b>out</b> with the skeleton usually left largely intact. Unlike wolves and coyotes, black bears rarely scatter the remains of their kills. Vegetation around the carcass is usually matted down by black bears, and their droppings are frequently found nearby. Black bears may attempt to cover remains of larger carcasses, though they do not do so with the same frequency as cougars and grizzly bears. They will readily consume eggs and nestlings of various birds and can easily access many tree nests, even the huge nest of the bald eagle. Black bears have been reported stealing deer and other animals from human hunters.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the same}} basic {{components}} are present in all vertebrate brains, some branches of vertebrate evolution have led to substantial distortions of brain geometry, especially in the forebrain area.

500|$|Rodents {{generally}} have well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and vision. Nocturnal species often have enlarged eyes {{and some are}} sensitive to ultraviolet light. Many species have long, sensitive whiskers or vibrissae for touch or [...] "whisking". Some rodents have cheek pouches, which may be lined with fur. These can be <b>turned</b> <b>inside</b> <b>out</b> for cleaning. In many species, the tongue cannot reach past the incisors. Rodents have efficient digestive systems, absorbing nearly 80% of ingested energy. When eating cellulose, the food is softened in the stomach and passed to the cecum, where bacteria reduce it to its carbohydrate elements. The rodent then practices coprophagy, eating its own fecal pellets, so the nutrients can be absorbed by the gut. Rodents therefore often produce a hard and dry fecal pellet. In many species, the penis contains a bone, the baculum; the testes can be located either abdominally or at the groin.|$|E

2500|$|The Tears Dress, {{a slender}} pale blue evening gown printed with a Dalí design of trompe l'oeil rips and tears, worn with a thigh-length veil with [...] "real" [...] tears {{carefully}} cut out and lined in pink and magenta, {{was part of}} the February 1938 Circus Collection.

Richard Martin saw the Tears Dress as a memento mori produced in response to the Spanish Civil War and the spread of Fascism, declaring that to [...] "tear the dress is to deny its customary decorum and utility, and to question the matter of concealment and revelation in the garment." [...] He noted that even if the tears in the dress were mere ornament like slashing, the real tears on the veil negated this, offering visual disagreements between reality and pretence.|$|E
