5|$|Not all ticks in an infective {{area are}} {{infected}} with pathogens, and both attachment of the tick and a long-feeding session seem to be necessary for transmission of these diseases to take place. Thus tick bites often do not lead to infection, especially if the ticks are removed within 36 hours. Adult ticks can be removed with fine-tipped <b>tweezers</b> or proprietary tick removal tools, disinfecting the wound. It is also possible to freeze them off with a medical wart remover. If the tick's head and mouthparts break off during removal, they can be removed with <b>tweezers</b> like a splinter.|$|E

5|$|Excavations in the 1990s {{confirmed}} {{the presence of}} a linear settlement, stretching along the Fosse Way for perhaps a kilometre, comprising cobbled streets, wooden and stone workshops and houses (some with two storeys) containing hearths and ovens, industrial areas, and a stone-lined well. A great many artefacts were found, including local and imported pottery (such as samian ware), items of jewellery such as brooches, rings and bracelets, toilet items including <b>tweezers,</b> ear scoops and nail cleaners, bronze and iron tools, and a lead ingot which probably originated from the Roman lead mines on the Mendip Hills. Coins minted across the Roman empire were also found. The finds on the site indicate occupation from the late-1st or early-2nd centuries to the late-4th or early-5th centuries. As no public buildings were found, the settlement was probably not a town.|$|E

5|$|A general {{principle}} concerning dental abscesses is ubi pus, ibi evacua ("{{where there is}} pus, drain it"), which applies to any case {{where there is a}} collection of pus in the tissues (such as a periodontal abscess, pericoronal abscess, or apical abscess). The pus within the abscess is under pressure, and the surrounding tissues are deformed and stretched to accommodate the swelling. This leads to a sensation of throbbing (often in time with the pulse) and constant pain. Pus may be evacuated via the tooth by drilling into the pulp chamber (an endodontic access cavity). Such a treatment is sometimes termed open drainage. Drainage can also be performed via the tooth socket, once the causative tooth is extracted. If neither of those measures succeeds, or they are impossible, incision and drainage may be required, in which a small incision is made in the soft tissues directly over the abscess at the most dependent point. A surgical instrument such as a pair of <b>tweezers</b> is gently inserted into the incision and opened, while the abscess is massaged to encourage the pus to drain out. Usually, the reduction in pain when the pus drains is immediate and marked as the built up pressure is relieved. If the pus drains into the mouth, there is usually a bad or offensive taste.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{implementation}} of an optical <b>tweezer</b> system for controlled transport of ultracold atoms along a narrow, static confinement channel. The <b>tweezer</b> system is based on high-efficiency acousto-optical deflectors and offers two-dimensional control over beam position. This opens up the possibility for tracking the transport channel when shuttling atomic clouds along the guide, forestalling atom spilling. Multiple clouds can be tracked independently by time-shared <b>tweezer</b> beams addressing individual sites in the channel. The deflectors are controlled using a multichannel direct digital synthesizer, which receives instructions on a sub-microsecond time scale from a field-programmable gate array. Using the <b>tweezer</b> system, we demonstrate sequential binary splitting of an ultracold ^ 87 Rb cloud into 2 ^ 5 clouds. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figures, 1 movie lin...|$|R

40|$|A {{library of}} diamidopyridine derived <b>tweezer</b> receptors with peptidic side-arms has been prepared. Screening {{experiments}} with {{the library and}} a dye-labelled tripeptide L-Glu-L-Ser-L-Val-OH showed excellent selectivity (strong binding of the dye-labelled guest to similar to ~ 0. 2 % of resin-bound library members was observed) {{and led to the}} identification of a <b>tweezer</b> receptor structure, which was shown to bind the tripeptide with good selectivity over related tripeptide sequences. Analogous screening experiments with the side-chain protected tripeptide L-Glu((OBu) -Bu-t) -L-Ser(Bu-t) -L-Val-OH, showed little selectivity for any particular library member. The results are discussed in relation to previous screening experiments, using the same tripeptide guests, with related <b>tweezer</b> receptor libraries, which differ by one methylene in the separation of the diamidopyridine unit from the peptidic side-arms of the <b>tweezer</b> receptors...|$|R
40|$|A novel type of <b>tweezer</b> {{molecule}} containing electron-rich 2 -pyrenyloxy arms {{has been}} designed to exploit intramolecular hydrogen bonding in stabilising a preferred conformation for supramolecular complexation to complementary sequences in aromatic copolyimides. This tweezer-conformation is demonstrated by single-crystal X-ray analyses of the <b>tweezer</b> molecule itself and of its complex with an aromatic diimide model-compound. In terms of its ability to bind selectively to polyimide chains, the new <b>tweezer</b> molecule shows very high sensitivity to sequence effects. Thus, even low concentrations of <b>tweezer</b> relative to diimide units (< 2. 5 mol%) are sufficient to produce dramatic, sequence-related splittings of the pyromellitimide proton NMR resonances. These induced resonance-shifts arise from ring-current shielding of pyromellitimide protons by the pyrenyloxy arms of the tweezer-molecule, and the magnitude of such shielding {{is a function of the}} tweezer-binding constant for any particular monomer sequence. Recognition of both short-range and long-range sequences is observed, the latter arising from cumulative ring-current shielding of diimide protons by <b>tweezer</b> molecules binding at multiple adjacent sites on the copolymer chain...|$|R
