5|$|Baldwin and {{his group}} arrived at Tyre on 16 September 1190. Richard did not arrive in Syria until 1191. It is unclear exactly why they were sent ahead of the king; perhaps it was <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the king's {{interests}} while Richard took a more leisurely route, or perhaps to rid the king's entourage of a family grouping around Glanvill that the king did not trust. Baldwin was not a member or close associate of the Glanvill faction, so most likely he was sent ahead {{to look after the}} king's interests, whatever the reasons for the inclusion of his companions. Another concern may have been to get help to the Kingdom of Jerusalem as quickly as possible after the king learned of Frederick Barbarossa's death {{on the way to the}} Holy Land.|$|E
5|$|Jeffries, {{realising}} his {{force was}} suffering heavy casualties, quickly organised a bombing party of fourteen men {{and set about}} outflanking the pillboxes. Accompanying Jeffries was Sergeant James Bruce, a 39-year-old Scottish-born miner {{who had worked for}} Jeffries' father at the Abermain Collieries. According to popular legend, Bruce had promised <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> his boss's son, and remained at Jeffries' side throughout the attack. Working around the position, the party attacked the emplacement from the rear, capturing four machine guns and thirty-five prisoners; thus reviving the advance. Jeffries then led his company forward under heavy artillery and machine gun fire to reach their first objective.|$|E

The {{last was}} named when a relief ship sent by MacNeil of Barra {{was sent to}} {{discover}} why communications from the island had ceased. A crewman called Macphee was sent ashore and returned to report that the residents had all died of disease. Fearing the plague, his shipmates refused to allow him back on board.

5|$|Marlene (Merle Dandridge) is {{the leader}} of the Fireflies, a militia {{movement}} hoping to wrest control of the Quarantine Zones from the military. She was tasked by Ellie's mother, a close friend of hers, <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> her daughter, but Ellie only met her after her infection. After being wounded in Boston, she offers to sell Joel and Tess the merchandise Robert stole from them and sold to her in return for smuggling Ellie out of the Quarantine Zone. Joel meets Marlene again at the Firefly hospital in Salt Lake City, where scientists are running tests on Ellie. Marlene reveals that they will operate on Ellie, which will result in her death; Joel disagrees with the operation and fights back. After Joel rescues Ellie, Marlene tries to stop him from leaving, insisting that taking Ellie will merely delay her death until a more gruesome one occurs, and Ellie's return to her would help to create a cure against the infection. Joel disregards her and instead shoots her in the stomach. She begs for her life, but Joel executes her with a shot to the head, ensuring that no-one is left to come after them.|$|E
5|$|Vytautas, {{supported}} by a few Polish banners, started {{an assault on the}} left flank of the Teutonic forces. After more than an hour of heavy fighting the Lithuanian light cavalry began a full retreat. Jan Długosz described this development as a complete annihilation of the entire Lithuanian army. According to Długosz, the Knights assumed that victory was theirs, broke their formation for a disorganized pursuit of the retreating Lithuanians and gathered much loot before returning to the battlefield to face the Polish troops. He made no mention of the Lithuanians, who later returned to the battlefield. Thus Długosz portrayed the battle as a single-handed Polish victory. This view contradicted Cronica conflictus and has been challenged by modern historians. Starting with an article by Vaclaw Lastowski in 1909, they proposed that the retreat was a planned, strategic maneuver borrowed from the Golden Horde. A false retreat was used in the Battle of the Vorskla River of 1399, where the Lithuanian army was dealt a crushing defeat and Vytautas himself barely escaped alive. This theory gained wider acceptance after the discovery and publication of a German letter by Swedish historian Sven Ekdahl in 1963. The letter, written a few years after the battle, cautions the new Grand Master <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> false retreats of the kind that were used in the Great Battle. Stephen Turnbull asserted that the Lithuanian retreat did not quite fit the tried formula of a false retreat. Such a retreat was usually staged by one or two units (as opposed to almost an entire army) and was swiftly followed by a counterattack (whereas the Lithuanians returned late in the battle).|$|E

By counting the number of moves until checkmate (assuming the opponent doesn't get to move) for both Black and White, this will help to influence decisions on whether to attack or defend. A simple mistake can change the flow of the game drastically.

25|$|In general, {{participation}} in a triathlon requires an athlete to register and sign up {{in advance of the}} actual race.

Athletes will either be provided or briefed on details of the course, rules, and any problems <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> (road conditions, closures, traffic lights, aid stations). At a major event, such as an Ironman or a long course championship, triathletes may be required to set up and check-in their bike in the transition area a day or two before the race start, leaving it overnight and under guard.|$|E
