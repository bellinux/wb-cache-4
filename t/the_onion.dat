5|$|The {{geographic}} {{origin of}} <b>the</b> <b>onion</b> is uncertain because the wild onion is extinct and ancient records of using onions span western and eastern Asia. The first cultivated, farmed onions {{are the subject}} of much debate, but the two regions that many archaeologists, botanists, and food historians will point to are central Asia or Persia. They were probably simultaneously domesticated by peoples all over the world, as there are species of <b>the</b> <b>onion</b> found the world over. Food uses of onions date back thousands of years in China, Egypt and Persia.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>onion</b> {{plant has}} {{a fan of}} hollow, bluish-green leaves and its bulb {{at the base of}} the plant begins to swell when a certain day-length is reached. The bulbs are {{composed}} of shortened, compressed, underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale (leaves) that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem. In the autumn (or in spring, in the case of overwintering onions), the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become dry and brittle. The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage. The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases, particularly <b>the</b> <b>onion</b> fly, <b>the</b> <b>onion</b> eelworm, and various fungi cause rotting. Some varieties of A. cepa, such as shallots and potato onions, produce multiple bulbs.|$|E
5|$|Allen's final home, on <b>the</b> <b>Onion</b> River (now {{called the}} Winooski River), {{is a part}} of the Ethan Allen Homestead and Museum. Situated in Burlington, Allen's {{homestead}} is open for viewing via guided tours.|$|E

5000|$|Vidalia is {{best known}} for its [...] "sweet" [...] <b>onions.</b> <b>The</b> Vidalia <b>onion</b> was first {{produced}} about 1931 when a farmer named Mose Coleman discovered that <b>the</b> <b>onions</b> he produced were sweeter than other onions. Other farmers started growing the same crop, and in the 1940s <b>the</b> Vidalia <b>onion</b> became an item sold to tourists.|$|R
5|$|An iOS port of the DS remake was {{released}} on March 24, 2011 on the App Store. Both the gameplay and graphics were improved, and the sound was remastered. However, the Mail/Mognet to other players was removed, with <b>the</b> <b>Onion</b> Knight job available via another quest.|$|E
5|$|Onions {{suffer from}} a number of plant disorders. The most serious for the home {{gardener}} are likely to be <b>the</b> <b>onion</b> fly, stem and bulb eelworm, white rot, and neck rot. Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut, downy mildew, and white tip disease. The bulbs may be affected by splitting, white rot, and neck rot. Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasant-smelling slime. Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants. The larvae of <b>the</b> <b>onion</b> leaf miner or leek moth (Acrolepiopsis assectella) sometimes attack the foliage and may burrow down into the bulb.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the eighteenth}} century, the Russian Orthodox Church did not assign any {{particular}} symbolism to the exterior {{shape of a}} church. Nevertheless, onion domes are popularly believed to symbolise burning candles. In 1917, noted religious philosopher Prince Yevgeny Trubetskoy argued that <b>the</b> <b>onion</b> shape of Russian church domes may not be explained rationally. According to Trubetskoy, drums crowned by tapering domes were deliberately scored to resemble candles, thus manifesting a certain aesthetic and religious attitude. Another explanation has it that <b>the</b> <b>onion</b> dome was originally regarded as a form reminiscent of the edicula (cubiculum) in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.|$|E
50|$|Quirke Export {{exported}} 2 {{shipments of}} <b>onions</b> to Taiwan. <b>The</b> size of <b>the</b> <b>onions</b> were important, with <b>the</b> <b>onions</b> {{required to be}} of a minimum size of between 2.25 and 2.5 inches, in order to suit the processing equipment in fast food restaurants.|$|R
5000|$|Onions and {{scrambled}} eggs - another variant of scrambled eggs eaten in <b>the</b> Philippines. <b>The</b> <b>onions</b> are either fried first then the egg mixture is poured over them to cook, or <b>the</b> <b>onions</b> {{are mixed with}} the egg mixture and then poured over the pan.|$|R
5|$|Some {{authors have}} used the name A. cepa var. viviparum (Metzg.) Alef. for <b>the</b> {{triploid}} <b>onion,</b> but this name has also been applied to <b>the</b> Egyptian <b>onion.</b> <b>The</b> only name unambiguously connected with <b>the</b> triploid <b>onion</b> is A. Ã—cornutum.|$|R
5|$|A central Food Production Committee, set up {{in early}} 1942, {{organised}} the conscripted labourers and attempted to help the white farmers to grow all the crops they could. Maize production grew by 40% between 1942 and 1944, the potato harvest doubled and <b>the</b> <b>onion</b> crop grew sixfold {{by the end of}} the war. Production of the colony's most important cash crop, tobacco, was high throughout the war, averaging about 40million pounds (18million kg) annually.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, onions may be bred {{and grown}} to mature at smaller sizes. Depending on the mature {{size and the}} purpose for which <b>the</b> <b>onion</b> is used, these may be {{referred}} to as pearl, boiler, or pickler onions, but differ from true pearl onions which are a different species. Pearl and boiler onions may be cooked as a vegetable rather than as an ingredient and pickler onions are often preserved in vinegar as a long-lasting relish.|$|E
5|$|Eye {{irritation}} can {{be avoided}} by cutting onions under running water or submerged in a basin of water. Leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as <b>the</b> <b>onion</b> base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds {{than the rest of}} the bulb. Refrigerating the onions before use reduces the enzyme reaction rate and using a fan can blow the gas away from the eyes. The more often one chops onions, the less one experiences eye irritation.|$|E
50|$|Many various {{ingredients}} {{may be used}} in preparations of onion sauce, such as cream, milk, butter, chicken broth, wine, port wine, beer, lemon juice, flour, salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, nutmeg, dry mustard, {{sage and}} other herbs, mushroom ketchup, bread crumbs, bacon and others. Preparation generally involves slicing or dicing and then cooking <b>the</b> <b>onions,</b> adding additional ingredients, and then continuing to cook or simmer the mixture to create a sauce. Some preparations involve frying <b>the</b> <b>onions</b> until they are browned, while others do not brown <b>the</b> <b>onions.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>onions</b> {{are named}} Vidalia because {{of where they}} are grown: Vidalia, Georgia. The growing of Vidalia onions there started in the early 1930s. The {{different}} varieties are unusually sweet, due to the low amount of sulfur in the soil in which <b>the</b> <b>onions</b> are grown.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Onion</b> Knight and the Cloud of Darkness are the {{respective}} hero and villainess representing Final Fantasy III in Dissidia Final Fantasy, {{where they are}} voiced by Jun Fukuyama and Masako Ikeda, respectively, in the Japanese version, and by Aaron Spann and Laura Bailey, respectively, in English. The characters reprise their roles in the sequel, Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>onion</b> eelworm (Ditylenchus dipsaci), a tiny {{parasitic}} soil-living nematode, causes swollen, distorted foliage. Young {{plants are}} killed and older ones produce soft bulbs. No cure is known and affected plants should be uprooted and burned. The site {{should not be}} used for growing onions again for several years and should also be avoided for growing carrots, parsnips, and beans, which are also susceptible to the eelworm.|$|E
5|$|Traces {{of onions}} {{recovered}} from Bronze Age settlements in China suggest that onions {{were used as}} far back as 5000 BCE, not only for their flavour, but the bulb's durability to store and transport. Ancient Egyptians revered <b>the</b> <b>onion</b> bulb, viewing its spherical shape and concentric rings as symbols of eternal life. Onions were used in Egyptian burials, as evidenced by onion traces found in the eye sockets of Ramesses IV.|$|E
5000|$|The next {{exercise}} {{is using the}} Smith Gun (an artillery piece unique to the Home Guard) to repel an assault by Ramsey's regular troops. The ammunition for the gun lies behind {{the same type of}} electrified fence the platoon were meant to have learnt how to scale in the previous test. Meanwhile, Hodges and the Verger have finally got the key to Jones's van from Walker, and they rush off to transfer <b>the</b> <b>onions</b> to Hodges's van. The platoon suddenly realise that they could use <b>the</b> <b>onions</b> instead of <b>the</b> ammunition for the Smith Gun. They rush to Hodges's van with Mainwaring demanding <b>the</b> <b>onions</b> [...] "in <b>the</b> name of the King", but is forced to buy them off Hodges. They rush back to the Smith Gun, load and fire <b>the</b> <b>onions</b> at <b>the</b> advancing troops, who retreat in confusion. The platoon are jubilant. Ramsey returns and congratulates Mainwaring, saying he has never seen such initiative displayed by a Home Guard unit and awards them 12 stars outright. They all then rush to retrieve <b>the</b> fallen <b>onions.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{his later}} years, {{independent}} Vermont continued to experience rapid population growth, and Allen sold {{a great deal}} of his land, but also reinvested much the proceeds in more land. A lack of cash, complicated by Vermont's currency problems, placed a strain on Fanny's relatively free hand on spending, which was further exacerbated by the cost of publishing Reason, and of {{the construction of a new}} home near the mouth of <b>the</b> <b>Onion</b> River. He was threatened with debtors' prison on at least one occasion, and was at times reduced to borrowing money and calling in old debts to make ends meet.|$|E
5|$|The Daily Mash is a British satirical website {{providing}} parodic {{commentary on}} current affairs and other news stories. Neil Rafferty (a former political correspondent for The Sunday Times) and Paul Stokes (former business editor of The Scotsman), created the website in 2007 and remain the lead writers. Both writers earn salaries from the enterprise and also employ freelance contributors. The publication has garnered praise for its absurd, scatological humour and insightful political satire. The current editor is comedy writer and former BBC journalist Tim Telling. The Daily Mash {{has often been}} compared to the US publication <b>The</b> <b>Onion.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{architectural}} {{style of the}} main building {{is a combination of}} Southern German and local Arabic. The tile roof and onion-dome tower mounted on a square base reflects the former, while wide, rounded arches for doors and windows reflect the latter. A lightning rod extends from <b>the</b> <b>onion</b> dome. The H-shaped main building has two interior courtyards which held a water cistern, garden and play area. The entire building covers an area of 50,590 square feet (4,700 square meters). At three stories, the main building housed the central dining room, a kitchen, a study hall, a library, a reading room, a small museum, and a Lutheran church in which students and staff worshipped.|$|E

50|$|When {{the sauce}} {{is used to}} {{accompany}} sautÃ©ed meat or poultry, it is made directly in the sautÃ© pan in which these items were cooked. <b>The</b> <b>onions</b> or shallots are sautÃ©ed in the pan and the red wine is added {{which is used to}} dissolve and incorporate the residue from the cooking of <b>the</b> meat. <b>The</b> <b>onions</b> may also be cooked {{at the same time as}} the meat.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>onion</b> fly (Delia antiqua) lays eggs on {{the leaves}} and stems {{and on the ground}} close to onion, shallot, leek, and garlic plants. The fly is {{attracted}} to the crop by the smell of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning. Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack. The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow. The bulbs are disfigured and rot, especially in wet weather. Control measures may include crop rotation, the use of seed dressings, early sowing or planting, and the removal of infested plants.|$|E
5|$|The remake takes {{advantage}} of the Wi-Fi feature of the Nintendo DS {{in the form of a}} Mail/Mognet system similar to Final Fantasy IX. Various moogles in the game allow the player to send email to others. Players are also able to send mail to various characters in the game as well as to other players. Side quests can also be unlocked using this system, such as the quest to unlock <b>the</b> <b>Onion</b> Knight. An interruption-save option is also available that lets the player turn off the DS and continue when turning it back on. Like in the original, there is no way to make permanent saves while inside a dungeon.|$|E
5|$|Frances is {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to impact the entire archipelago since 1866. On September 4, teams from the Ministry of Works, the Department of Environmental Health Services, the Royal Bahamas Defence Force and the Royal Bahamas Police Force were used to clear roadways of tree debris while utilities attempted to restore power and water in New Providence. The Family Islands were surveyed on September 5 and 6, when {{it was noted that}} major damage occurred within the island group. Telecommunications were restored to most of the island chain within 24 hours. As of September 21, electricity had been restored to half of the Bahamians who had lost power. Western sections of Grand Bahama Island remained without power into Hurricane Jeanne, which was the most significantly impacted island. <b>The</b> <b>onion</b> crop was expected to be late in 2005 due to the loss of seedbeds and seedlings during the storm.|$|E
