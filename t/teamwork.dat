5|$|The men {{actively}} {{market their}} act to corporate events, where they demonstrate {{the concept of}} <b>teamwork</b> by bringing executives and employees to the stage and by using the company's products and logos {{as part of their}} act. They have performed to stress the value of <b>teamwork</b> for such diverse organizations as Boeing, Deloitte and Touche, Hewlett-Packard, Mattel and the United States Army.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the rise}} of the Knicks, the 1974 {{championship}} returned to the Celtics, as a newly formed cohort of players led by Dave Cowens demonstrated excellent <b>teamwork</b> and resilience to win in seven games to secure another title.|$|E
5|$|Players earn {{credits for}} {{knocking}} out opponents, scoring points, and impressing {{the crowd with}} violence and skill. The credits can be used towards player enhancements such as black market performance-enhancing drugs. A crowd meter displays audience support, which boosts the player's team abilities when filled. IGN found the game to heavily rely on <b>teamwork.</b> Computer players on teams rated with low <b>teamwork</b> will not take initiative to pursue the disc or to help teammates in need. This attribute can be raised {{over the course of}} a game. Players can call plays including physical offense, fast offense, neutral, defense, and goal defense.|$|E
5|$|Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege {{received}} positive reviews. Critics generally {{praised the}} game's destructive environment, tactical nature, map design, and {{its focus on}} <b>teamwork.</b> However, the lack of content and the game's microtransactions were subjected to criticism.|$|E
5|$|Tactical Realism: a {{variation}} of the standard competitive multiplayer modes, added with the release of the Operation Skull Rain DLC. The game mode features a heavier emphasis on realism and <b>teamwork,</b> removing most of the heads-up display (HUD) elements, the ability to mark opponents, and the ability to see teammates' contours through walls, while also featuring the addition of a realistic ammo management system.|$|E
5|$|Andrews {{delivers}} motivational speeches for corporations, conferences, {{community groups}} and schools, usually on {{the topics of}} individual potential {{and the importance of}} <b>teamwork</b> in achieving goals, and drawing on the values of the Olympic movement. She {{is a member of the}} U.S. Olympic Committee, and has served as a volunteer for the U.S. Olympic Alumni Association since 2004. She is also a veteran celebrity swimmer for Swim Across America (SAA), a charitable organization that uses former Olympic swimmers to raise funds for cancer research, and has participated in SAA events for nine years.|$|E
5|$|Beilein {{is known}} for his Princeton {{offensive}} system, which emphasizes constant motion, passing, disciplined <b>teamwork,</b> and precision shooting. The offense usually starts out with four players outside the three-point arc, and one player {{at the top of the}} key (though at times a post player may operate closer to the basket). From this formation, Beilein's teams not only try to open up space for players to cut to the basket, but also are known for their high number of three-point attempts. On defense, Beilein has become known for employing the 1–3–1 halfcourt zone defense, which is considered to be an unconventional zone defense – though he also regularly employs man-to-man and 2-3 zone defenses.|$|E
5|$|City won {{immediate}} promotion as Second Division champions in 1902–03, with Meredith scoring 22 {{goals in}} 37 appearances and claiming a hat-trick against Chesterfield Town. Maley {{managed to find}} him a suitable inside-right partner in Jimmy Bannister, who was unselfish in his play and willing to feed the ball through to Meredith. He also played Sammy Frost at half-back, {{who was able to}} win the ball and bring Meredith into the play, and signed outside-left Frank Booth to balance the attack. Maley encouraged <b>teamwork,</b> meaning there was less pressure on Meredith from opposition defenders.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Henson and {{his wife}} moved to New York City, where the newly formed Muppets, Inc., would reside for some time. Jane quit {{performing}} to raise their children. Henson hired writer Jerry Juhl in 1961 and puppet performer Frank Oz in 1963 to replace her. Henson later credited both with developing much of the humor and character of his Muppets. Henson and Oz developed a close friendship and a performing partnership that lasted 27 years; their <b>teamwork</b> is particularly evident in their portrayals of the characters of Bert and Ernie, Kermit and Miss Piggy, and Kermit and Fozzie Bear.|$|E
5|$|In Ellicott, New York, Arlen Sacks {{is killed}} by an unknown {{creature}} that sprays venom on its victims, and his son Gary goes missing. In the meantime, at the FBI headquarters, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), preparing for maternity leave, packs up her belongings at the X-Files office. Scully finds a medallion commemorating the Apollo 11 space flight {{that was given to}} her for her birthday by Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). Scully gives John Doggett (Robert Patrick) the medallion, explaining that it symbolizes <b>teamwork.</b> After Scully leaves, Special Agent Leyla Harrison arrives and tells Doggett that she is his new partner. The two are soon assigned to investigate Sacks' bizarre murder.|$|E
5|$|In the book's opening, {{the title}} {{character}} and her mate ambush a herd of Astrodon, which are large herbivorous sauropods. The Astrodon are surprised, thinking that their bulk deters smaller predators. Utahraptor, however, are much larger than any resident raptor, and proceed to take down an Astrodon with <b>teamwork.</b> When Red's mate climbs onto the dead Astrodon, the corpse rolls in the mud, trapping the male under {{the bulk of the}} animal. Despite Red's best efforts, her mate suffocates. Despondent, Red wanders around the floodplain, nearly starving since a Utahraptor cannot successfully hunt big game on its own.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} season, {{the format of}} the show changed drastically. The maximum age dropped from 31 to 28. The cast of season two were given {{mandatory}} non-profit jobs to help them build a work ethic and to experience the stabilizing effect of being interdependent with others, for example in <b>teamwork</b> and commitment, to equip them for success in later life. Quitting the job or failure to attend resulted in mandatory removal from the show. The girls were given the jobs of planning, decision making, and building cooperation. Season two was the first and only season of the Bad Girls Club to do this, and was also the last to air 30-minute episodes.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns holds a {{fire drill}} at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant; the {{employees}} panic {{and fail to}} evacuate the plant within 15 minutes. Outraged, Burns declares that everyone will be subjected to a <b>teamwork</b> competition at a mountain. Homer is partnered with Burns while Smithers has to journey on his own. The objective of the competition is to reach a cabin {{at the top of}} the mountain; the last team to arrive will be fired.|$|E
5|$|Scout, Tenderfoot, Second Class, and First Class is {{designed}} to teach the boy Scoutcraft skills, <b>teamwork,</b> and self-reliance. Scout is the first rank, awarded when a boy first joins the Scouts, and requires just a rudimentary knowledge of Scouting's ideals. Further ranks have progressive requirements {{in the areas of}} Scoutcraft, physical fitness, citizenship, personal growth, and Scout Spirit. Scouts with a permanent mental or physical disability may use alternate requirements, based on their abilities and approved by the council.|$|E
5|$|There are 150 unique {{players on}} 18 teams, each with {{thematic}} personalities in appearance, play style, and profanity. Teams also vary in skill set, and attributes such as defense, speed, strength, and <b>teamwork.</b> Examples include the Sea Cats (fast all-female team with European accents), the Marines (who wear camouflaged garb and use military jargon), the Demons (high strength attribute with demonic language), and the Black Dragons (ninjas with high agility and combat skills). Teams battle in 32 arenas—one half with traditional, open-style stadiums, {{and the other}} half with environmental obstacles, such as the underground mines. Minor power-ups including health, credits, and skill augments for individual players regenerate regularly on the field.|$|E
5|$|When Bjarne Riis {{took over}} in winter 2000, he hired the former Danish Ranger Corps soldier B.S. Christiansen as advisor and they gave CSC a {{distinct}} philosophy and training methods. The team works with four values: communication, loyalty, commitment and respect, {{with the aim of}} improving <b>teamwork.</b> The team rides for the rider in the best shape on the day, and separates the function of team captain (the rider making decisions) and team leader (the rider trying to win) to avoid pressure on a single rider.|$|E
5|$|After Extreme Rules, Orton began pairing with Daniel Bryan {{despite their}} poor {{relationship}} {{to face a}} common enemy in the Shield. On the June 14 SmackDown, Orton teamed with Bryan and Kane to end the Shield's unpinned and unsubmitted streak in televised six-man tag matches. Three days later at Payback, Orton and Bryan's poor <b>teamwork</b> resulted in an unsuccessful challenge for Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins' WWE Tag Team Championships. The following night on Raw, Orton and Bryan faced off in a no disqualification match, which Orton won via referee stoppage after Bryan suffered a legitimate nerve injury. Four days later on SmackDown, Orton was defeated by Bryan in a singles match via countout. Orton and Bryan faced {{each other for the}} third time on the next Raw, but their match ended in a no-contest after both men were counted out. Later that night, Orton was defeated by Bryan in a Street Fight Match after he was forced to submit to the Yes! Lock with a kindo stick applied to the move.|$|E
5|$|After a {{short time}} in jail, they are {{released}} by a social worker named Gabriel, whom Homer mistakes for an angel sent from Heaven. Gabriel moves in with the family to help them be functional again. After observing the family's quirks, Gabriel takes the family to a forest and diagnoses the family's problems accordingly: Marge tries to prove her self-worth to the family by medicating them with food, Bart is addicted to doing crazy stunts for attention, and Homer is simply a drunken buffoon. Gabriel then sets up a challenge to teach the Simpsons the importance of <b>teamwork</b> by setting up a picnic basket in a tree. The object is for the family to work {{together as a team}} to get it down. After a harrowing rescue involving Bart driving the family car and Homer nearly becoming prey for wild predators, the Simpsons succeed and Gabriel congratulates them on working together as a family and becoming functional during their drive home.|$|E
5|$|Flowing from Auerbach's {{emphasis}} on <b>teamwork,</b> what was also striking about his teams {{was that they}} never {{seemed to have a}} dominant scorer: in the 1960–61 NBA season, for instance, the Celtics had six players who scored between 15 and 21 points per game, but none made the Top 10 scoring list. In 1964, he sent out the first-ever NBA starting five consisting of an African-American quintet, namely Russell, Willie Naulls, Tom Sanders, Sam Jones, and K. C. Jones. Auerbach would go a step further in the 1966–67 NBA season, when he stepped down after winning nine titles in 11 years, and made Bill Russell player-coach. Auerbach also popularized smoking a victory cigar whenever he thought a game was already decided, a habit that became cult-like in popularity in the Boston area. Furthermore, having acquired a reputation as a fierce competitor, he often got into verbal altercations with officials, receiving more fines and getting ejected more often than any other coach in NBA history.|$|E
5|$|For {{some time}} Zwingli had accused mendicant orders of {{hypocrisy}} and demanded their abolition {{in order to}} support the truly poor. He suggested the monasteries be changed into hospitals and welfare institutions and incorporate their wealth into a welfare fund. This was done by reorganising the foundations of the Grossmünster and Fraumünster and pensioning off remaining nuns and monks. The council secularised the church properties (Fraumünster handed over by Zwingli's acquaintance Katharina von Zimmern) and established new welfare programs for the poor. Zwingli requested permission to establish a Latin school, the Prophezei (Prophecy) or Carolinum, at the Grossmünster. The council agreed and it was officially opened on 19 June 1525 with Zwingli and Jud as teachers. It served to retrain and re-educate the clergy. The Zurich Bible translation, traditionally attributed to Zwingli and printed by Christoph Froschauer, bears the mark of <b>teamwork</b> from the Prophecy school. Scholars have not yet attempted to clarify Zwingli's share of the work based on external and stylistic evidence.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to punishing soldiers, tightening dismissal regulations {{and reducing the}} number of Vietnamese servicemen in France, the French decided to improve the military intelligence service. This was to be achieved by strengthening military intelligence through closer coordination with the Sûreté, and by raising internal standards. An inquiry into the mutiny at showed that cooperation between Resident Massimi and Commandant Le Tacon did not exist despite multiple requests, and that it was partly responsible for the uprising. The relationship between the civilian and military authorities were traditionally poor, but Yen Bay stood out in the total lack of military-civilian cooperation. Further VNQDĐ conspiracies to foment mutinies in other garrisons, such as Kiến An, were detected and scotched at late notice. It was decided that the <b>teamwork</b> with the Sûreté had to be raised to greater heights to prevent future Yen Bay style rebellions. The rebellion allowed the civilian authorities an opportunity to involve themselves in military matters.|$|E
5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) asks Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) to {{accompany}} him to the Six Sigmas Retreat in Croton-on-Hudson, New York, following his Bush administration and CEO debacles. There, Jack meets with the Six Sigmas, six men who each embody a core feature of Six Sigma: <b>teamwork,</b> insight, brutality, male enhancement, hand-shake-fulness and play-hard. They disapprove of Liz's antics during the team building exercises and demand that Jack distance himself from her {{if he wants to}} succeed, which he does. Before his dinner speech, Jack psyches himself up in the men's room, completely forgetting that he is wearing a microphone and that everyone can hear him. Liz quickly takes the stage to draw attention away from Jack's embarrassment and finally ends up ripping her blouse open and dancing in front of everyone. She succeeds, and is banned from the retreat forever.|$|E
5|$|Ripken {{has made}} {{donations}} to many various charitable causes, including donations supporting research on Lou Gehrig's disease. After he broke Gehrig's record, the Orioles, along with private donors, created the Cal Ripken/Lou Gehrig Fund for Neuromuscular Research at Johns Hopkins University. Along {{with his brother}} Billy, he formed the Cal Ripken Sr., Foundation in 2001 to give underprivileged children the opportunity to attend baseball camps {{around the country and}} learn the game. The Foundation is a branch of Ripken Baseball. In addition to controlling these camps and Ripken's minor league teams, Ripken Baseball operates for-profit camps and designs ballfields for youth, college, and professional teams. He gives speeches about his time in baseball and some of the lessons he has learned. Between 2001 and 2004, inclusive, Ripken served as commissioner of the White House Tee Ball Initiative of President George W. Bush, in which capacity he worked to promote the value of <b>teamwork</b> amongst players and volunteership amongst the public and helped to teach tee ball fundamentals to teams of children at the White House.|$|E
5|$|Team {{effectiveness}} (also {{referred to}} as group effectiveness) is the capacity a team has to accomplish the goals or objectives administered by an authorized personnel or the organization. A team {{is a collection of}} individuals who are interdependent in their tasks, share responsibility for outcomes, and view themselves as a unit embedded in an institutional or organizational system which operates within the established boundaries of that system. Teams and groups have established a synonymous relationship within the confines of processes and research relating to their effectiveness (i.e. group cohesiveness, <b>teamwork)</b> while still maintaining their independence as two separate units, as groups and their members are independent of each other's role, skill, knowledge or purpose versus teams and their members, who are interdependent upon each other's role, skill, knowledge and purpose.|$|E
5|$|The Balkan intermezzo {{was short}} and the {{detachment}} relocated back to Gela beginning on 8 April. Müncheberg claimed two Hurricanes of No. 261 Squadron on 11 April and another one on 23 April. A reconnaissance Bf109 detected a four-engine Short Sunderland at RAF Kalafrana on 27 April. Müncheberg led his 7. Staffel in the attack, destroying the Sunderland. The victory was not credited to any individual pilot but was considered <b>teamwork</b> of the 7. Staffel. On 29 April, 7. Staffel provided fighter protection for Junkers Ju 88 bombers attacking Malta. 7. Staffel claimed two Hurricanes shot down, one by Münchberg, {{for the loss of}} one Ju 88. The German actress and Ufa star, Carola Höhn, wife of bomber pilot Arved Crüger, on a mission to provide entertainment to the troops, visited the pilots at Gela. According to Röll, Müncheberg was especially attracted to the actress and personally accompanied her during her visit.|$|E
5|$|Queen's Park {{took the}} {{advantage}} {{early on in}} the second half, and a series of rapid attacks followed the break. The Scottish team were only prevented from scoring in one goal mouth scramble by the <b>teamwork</b> of Arthur and Suter. Rovers appeared to have switched to a defensive posture, and conceded a further corner kick, but nothing came of it as Gow kicked it behind the goal. A further handball just inside the Queen's Park half resulted in a solitary attack for Blackburn, ending in Brown sending the ball over the crossbar. Further attacks Queen's Park followed, but one further attack from Blackburn led to a shot from Brown which many in the crowd thought crossed the line before Gillespie cleared it. Blackburn dominated the final five minutes of the game, and the match ended 2–1; all three goals were scored in the first half. The medals and trophy had been expected to be awarded by Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, however due to his death on the day before the final, they were not presented publicly. Instead, Major Marindin handed them over in the dressing rooms.|$|E
5|$|To {{promote the}} game, Valve has {{produced}} three machinima trailers depicting {{the game in}} play. The trailers are themed around wartime propaganda news reports for both Germany and the United States. To convey this effect, the trailers make extensive usage of the Source engine's capabilities for film grain, color correction, motion blur and depth of field, as well as sepia toning. The first trailer was released {{as part of the}} game's post-release marketing on December 20, 2005. Entitled Prelude to Victory, the trailer depicted a large firefight in the game as a report from the German perspective, complete with a commentator speaking in the German language. Two further trailers were released to promote the major update to Day of Defeat: Source {{in the second quarter of}} 2006. The trailers, both from the American viewpoint, displayed how the new detonation gameplay worked, emphasising <b>teamwork</b> as the key to success, as well as introducing the viewer to the two new maps added by the update. To further create interest in the game, Valve has opened Day of Defeat: Source to three free weekends, the first taking place on February 10, 2006, the second on July 8, 2006 and the third on July 4, 2008, where anyone with a Steam account could download and play the game for a maximum of 48 hours free of charge.|$|E
5|$|While {{few other}} purely Expressionistic films were made, Caligari {{still had a}} major {{influence}} over other German directors, {{and many of the}} film's Expressionist elements – particularly the use of setting, light and shadow to represent the dark psychology of its characters – became prevalent in German cinema. Among the films to use these elements were Murnau's Nosferatu (1922) and The Last Laugh (1924), G. W. Pabst's Secrets of a Soul (1926), and Lang's Metropolis (1927) and M (1931). The success of Caligari also affected the way in which German films were produced during the 1920s. For example, the majority of major German films {{over the next few years}} moved away from location shooting and were fully filmed in studios, which assigned much more importance to designers in German cinema. Robinson argues this led to the rise of a large number of film designers – such as Hans Dreier, Rochus Gliese, Albin Grau, Otto Hunte, Alfred Junge, Erich Kettelhut and Paul Leni – and that effect was felt abroad as many of these talents later emigrated from Germany with the rise of the Nazi Party. Additionally, the success of Caligaris collaborative effort – including its director, set designers and actors – influenced subsequent film production in Germany for many years, making <b>teamwork</b> a hallmark of German cinema in the Weimar Republic.|$|E
