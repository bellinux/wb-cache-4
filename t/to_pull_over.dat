5|$|Timoshenko and his partner, Officer Herman Yan, {{had been}} driving in a marked 71st precinct police car on a routine patrol in Crown Heights, with Timoshenko riding as the {{passenger}} when they spotted a 2003 black BMW sports utility vehicle headed westbound on Lefferts Avenue at 2:30 am. The officers scanned the BMW's license plate on a computer in their police car. When the check came back, it indicated that the plate was assigned to a 2007 Mitsubishi Outlander, not the BMW. Timoshenko and Yan signaled for the vehicle <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>over,</b> and the driver complied, turning north onto Rogers Avenue, where both officers got out of their car and approached the stopped vehicle.|$|E
5|$|It was Hamilton's {{teammate}} {{and defending}} race winner Rosberg who topped the time sheets {{at the second}} session on Friday afternoon, setting a 1:12.385 lap time. He led Hamilton by almost half a second, with the two Ferrari cars of Vettel and Räikkönen about a second adrift. Slight rain saw most drivers head out early, but the conditions never became wet enough to require intermediate tyres. After starting on the medium compound tyres, many drivers switched to the softer compound for race simulations, only for the session to be red flagged shortly after when Fernando Alonso spun at turn four, only <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>over</b> {{at the side of}} the road with smoke coming from his car some corners later. Valtteri Bottas was sixth fastest, behind Daniel Ricciardo, suffering a spin at turn nine.|$|E
25|$|Emergency vehicle {{lighting}} is generally used {{to clear the}} right of way for emergency vehicles, or to warn approaching motorists of potential hazards, such as a vehicle that is stopped or moving slower than the rate of traffic, or a car that has been pulled over. It may also be used to provide specific directions to motorists, such as a command <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>over.</b> Some vehicles incorporate a small arrow board to direct traffic.|$|E

25|$|On 4 July 1991, Chang {{was shot}} {{twice in the}} head in a failed {{extortion}} attempt. His body was found slumped in the gutter next to his car in the Sydney suburb of Mosman. Two Malaysian men, Chew Seng (Ah Sung) Liew and Choon Tee (Phillip) Lim, ran their car into Chang's vehicle, forcing him <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>over.</b> After getting into an argument with Chang who refused to give them money, Liew fired the fatal shots; the first entered near the right cheek and exited below the right ear, while the fatal second, fired from point-blank range, entered the right temple and passed through the brain. Police investigators initially suspected the involvement of Triad syndicates, but later concluded the killing was an amateur act.|$|E
25|$|On May 22, 2015, {{a three-hour}} shootout broke {{out between the}} Mexican Federal Police and alleged members of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) in Tanhuato and Ecuandureo, Michoacán, leaving 43 dead. One of the {{fatalities}} was a Federal Police officer, while the others were suspected to be organized crime members. The confrontation started when the Federal Police spotted a suspicious vehicle on a highway. The authorities had received information {{that one of the}} properties in the area had been overrun by criminals. Unconfirmed reports suggested that the CJNG leader Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes was in the area. When they tried <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>over</b> the vehicle, however, the men onboard opened fire at the police units. A vehicle chase ensued and the security forces made their way into a large, rural property where the shootout intensified. The Federal Police then called for ground and air reinforcements and neutralized the situation.|$|E
25|$|The {{color of}} {{emergency}} vehicle lighting is blue. Vehicles using flashing blue lights and siren have {{right of way}} over all other vehicles. Only designated emergency/priority vehicles may use blue lights; this includes police, fire brigade, ambulance service and a few other, smaller services such as the blood bank and some lifeguard organizations. Dutch police vehicles have an LED matrix display, which can show different texts in red lighting. Most often used are STOP POLITIE (ordering a driver <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>over</b> and stop) or VOLGEN POLITIE (ordering driver to follow the police vehicle). Standard Dutch police cars often have the text bar incorporated in the light bar, vans and motorcycles usually have a separate sign {{on the front of}} the vehicle. On ambulances, a green beacon indicates the command vehicle when multiple units are responding to an incident - usually this is the first vehicle that arrives on the scene. Newer ambulance models also have a text display that will alternate the words ‘Ambulance’ and ‘Spoed’ (‘urgent’). When ever the vehicles are on scene (usually fire brigade vehicles and some police vans), or staying in place for an other reason, they need to switch to amber lighting to signal that they are not moving.|$|E

500|$|Trucks {{have been}} {{prohibited}} for the [...] "safety {{and welfare of}} the public" [...] since 1934 because of the state's approval of a local ordinance that was championed by Frank Hague, mayor of Jersey City. They are detoured to use U.S. Route1/9 Truck, along {{the route of the}} Lincoln Highway that carried traffic before the skyway's construction. Pedestrians and cyclists are banned, as the road has no dedicated lanes or sidewalks. The speed limit on the skyway is , but is generally not enforceable as there is nowhere for police <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>over</b> speeders because of the absence of shoulders.|$|E
500|$|On 16 September 1939, the Rudyard Kipling left Fleetwood for {{a routine}} fishing trip {{to an area}} off {{the west coast of}} Ireland. The trawler, under the command of Skipper Charles Robinson and with a crew of 12 men, was about [...] west of the Irish town of Donegal when [...] came {{alongside}} and ordered them <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>over</b> to the submarine and surrender. The German crew then took the Rudyard Kiplings food, including sugar, bread and fish, as well as the trawler's wireless radios, and transferred them over to the U-boat. Timed explosive charges were then placed on the trawler and three minutes later, at 15:53, the trawler exploded and sank.|$|E
500|$|The dissent argued that, for {{a section}} 1983 {{claim to be}} valid, [...] "harm alone is not enough; {{it has to be}} the right kind of harm." [...] Thomas {{provided}} an example of a law allowing police <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>over</b> any driver without cause. This would obviously violate the Fourth Amendment rights of anyone stopped, but people stuck in traffic who were injured by the collateral damage of unconstitutional actions {{would not be able to}} sue because none of their rights was violated. Similarly, it is not enough for Heffernan to have shown injury but violation of an actual right as well. For the dissent, even if the dismissal was for the wrong reason and harm was suffered, the dismissal cannot infringe upon rights he never exercised.|$|E

500|$|The {{remaining}} expressway {{portion of}} SR54 {{was replaced by}} a freeway in two phases in the late 1990s and the 2000s. The first phase corresponded with construction of SR125 north of Jamacha Boulevard to SR94; construction began in 1996 and was completed in 2003. The second phase consisted of the construction of the SR125 toll road and opened on November 19, 2007. While California Transportation Ventures owned the franchise on the tolled portion of SR125, the interchange with SR54 was constructed with $160million (about $ in [...] dollars) of public funding. From 2005 to 2007, [...] of rock were blasted through in 160 separate explosions to allow for the interchange to be built. The project to convert the HOV lanes to regular mixed traffic lanes was authorized in 2006. Caltrans determined that the lack of space for law enforcement <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>over</b> carpool lane violators, as well as a missing barrier separating the HOV lanes from regular traffic, made the lanes less effective.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{emergency}} vehicles use signs {{made up of}} a large number of light sources (usually LEDs), which can be programmed to display messages to other road users. [...] This can be used to request other vehicles <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>over,</b> indicate a special instruction, or just to display the name of the operating service (e.g. ‘Police’).|$|E
2500|$|German police lightbars {{often have}} ‘POLIZEI’ written in white over the dome, and usually {{incorporate}} an LED text display that can read, in mirrored writing if towards the front, ‘STOP POLIZEI’ or ‘BITTE FOLGEN’ (‘please follow’), to signal drivers <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>over.</b> In the newest generation, the text display changes between German and English (STOP [...] POLIZEI → STOP POLICE and BITTE FOLGEN → FOLLOW ME).|$|E
2500|$|In the 1880s the reaper and {{threshing}} machine were combined into the combine harvester.

2500|$|The state Department of Transportation {{commonly}} {{sends out}} work crews {{twice a year}} to drive along {{both sides of the}} parkway at 5mph (8km/h) in search of decrepit trees. [...] Trees that had been scheduled to be cut down in five or ten years would be removed sooner. [...] Some more trees also would be removed, as the shoulder of the parkway is being widened to eight feet in order to give drivers room <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>over.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Onley's {{appointment}} as Lieutenant Governor was announced on July 10, 2007; he was privately informed of this after a July 4, 2007, taping of Home Page: [...] "I just {{had reached the}} top of the Don Valley Parkway... and there was no place <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>over.</b> And when the Prime Minister of your country calls, all you can try to do is stay in the same lane, avoid any fender-benders and have a meaningful conversation, which I did." ...|$|E
2500|$|A St. Anthony {{police officer}} patrolling Larpenteur Avenue radioed {{to a nearby}} squad that he planned <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>over</b> the car and check the IDs of the driver and passenger, saying, [...] "The two {{occupants}} just look like people that {{were involved in a}} robbery. The driver looks more like one of our suspects, just because of the wide-set nose. I couldn't {{get a good look at}} the passenger."

50|$|Many tops, {{including}} turtlenecks, mock turtlenecks, {{and similar}} sweaters, have back zippers. The zippers {{do not need}} to be open in order for the top <b>to</b> be <b>pulled</b> <b>over.</b> But the zipper allows the top to be widely open when being <b>pulled</b> <b>over</b> in order <b>to</b> not disturb one's hair style. These tops are usually marketed to older adults, who are more likely to have delicate hair styles that can be damaged by <b>pulling</b> a garment <b>over.</b>|$|R
2500|$|May was {{hampered}} by the Jaguar's limited fuel range and an unreliable petrol gauge which caused him to make frequent filling station stops {{out of fear of}} running out of fuel. Hammond had attempted to prolong his fuel stops to the very last possible moment by employing the Vincent's reserve fuel tank. This backfired after his fuel stop [...] south of Doncaster, as Hammond was forced <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>over</b> in the rain after breaking down. Having failed to close the reserve tank tap, sludge from the fuel tank had entered the fuel lines and blocked the left hand carburettor.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} cases where criminals have pulled over motorists while {{pretending to be}} driving unmarked police cars, a form of police impersonation. Some US police {{officers}} advise motorists {{that they do not}} have <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>over</b> in a secluded location and instead can wait until they reach somewhere safer. In the UK, officers must be wearing uniform in order to make traffic stops. Motorists can also ask for a police badge. [...] Motorists often have the option to call a non-emergency number (like Police 101 in the UK) or, if the country does not have one, the emergency number. This telephone call can then be used verify that the police car ( [...] and officer(s) [...] ) is genuine.|$|E
2500|$|On the highway, {{the police}} tried <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>over</b> the vehicle, but the gunmen opened {{fire at the}} police units and {{attempted}} to escape, initiating a vehicle chase. The gunmen then fled to the original destination of the authorities, the [...] "Rancho del Sol" [...] ranch, where other gunmen were hiding. Inside the property, the organized crime members exited the vehicle and started shooting at the Federal Police units. The other gunmen that were inside the property joined them. The Federal Police commissioner [...] stated that the police asked for the gunmen to surrender through a megaphone, {{as part of the}} law enforcement protocol, but most of the gunmen ignored the request and continued the confrontation. Only three of them surrendered and turned themselves in.|$|E
