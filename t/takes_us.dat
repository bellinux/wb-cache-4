5|$|Ruiz {{notes that}} writing {{also has the}} power to {{transform}} reality. It brings the reader back to the past, allowing the reader to comprehend myths or distorted stories told by historians. Ruiz contends that knowing the past is crucial to one's understanding of the present that <b>takes</b> <b>us</b> to postmodernism, and argues that The Feast of the Goat can thus be seen as a postmodern discourse that gives power to history recreation.|$|E

When the mall Santa leaves for the night and Brian demands that he let Stewie sit in his lap, Santa mentions he will be at Applebee's. Stewie says that Santa leaving before he got a chance to sit in his lap felt like a bigger betrayal than the betrayal of Gary Busey by reality; this <b>takes</b> <b>us</b> to Busey looking himself in the mirror asking his reflection, {{in the form of a}} crazed clown, how he is doing.|$|E

The two mountains were used to symbolize the significance of the commandments and serve as a warning to whoever disobeyed them.|$|E
25|$|The third first-person {{narration}} from Alhambra follows, {{which is}} much the same as the second. We then have “The End”, which <b>takes</b> <b>us</b> to the Smart home once they return from holiday. The house has been emptied of all possessions – we must assume, as the family do, by Amber – leaving nothing but the answering machine, which contains messages forcing Magnus, Michael and Eve to face up to their past. Magnus and Astrid seem freed and excited by the experience of losing their possessions, their past – Michael also seems to find some redemption. Eve, however, runs away from the family, embarking on a round-the-world tour – eventually ending up in America, where she goes in search of her old family home. “The End” ends, ominously, with Eve seeming to take up Amber’s mantle, arriving at someone’s house as an uninvited guest. The book then finishes with a short section from Alhambra, reinforcing her connection to the cinema.|$|E

From the style of their dress and the wonky-TV effects on the video, one might guess that Bruno and his friends are partying in the '70s.

She later explained choosing which producers to work with, saying [...] "All of these people have a reputation for being visionaries and knowing them well, I felt 'Okay, now it's time to put together a project that not only <b>takes</b> <b>us</b> to another place, another dimension, but highlights these sights.'

500|$|In May 1915, the Turkish {{force that}} would confront the New Zealanders was {{provided}} by the 19th Division, comprising the 57th, 72nd and 77th Infantry Regiments, all under the command of Colonel Mustafa Kemal. Kemal was noted as [...] "the most imaginative, most successful officer to fight on either side" [...] during the Gallipoli Campaign. How the Turks viewed the invasion can be judged by Kemal's orders to his troops following the initial landings; [...] "Men, I am not ordering you to attack. I am ordering you to die.

The album is produced by Markus Dravs, who worked on previous album, 2007's Neon Bible and was engineered by Marcus Paquin, who has also previously worked with the band. A track-by-track review ahead of The Suburbs release by The Quietus website said, [...] "The progression is similar to the one William Blake <b>takes</b> <b>us</b> through in Songs of Innocence and of Experience that suggests forward momentum and maturity."

500|$|The film explores {{controversial}} themes such as racism, {{abuse of}} power, and rape. Voyeurism {{is also a}} major element due to the protagonist's extensive use of SQUID technology. The fact that the film was directed by a woman was even more controversial, with film critic Michael Mirasol noting that had Strange Days been directed by a man, these scenes would likely have been criticized as sexist and misogynistic. Nevertheless, Bigelow insisted that the film does not glorify violence {{and that it has}} a positive purpose. According to her, [...] "I wanted to treat 'the system' fairly, because if it's the enemy, then we're the enemy, since by not changing it we're reproducing it... The film ends in a strong insistence on hope. Ultimately it's humanity - not technology - that <b>takes</b> <b>us</b> into the next century and the next millennium." ...|$|E

[...] Journalist Graham Fraser said in the Toronto Star that Harper's speech was [...] "one of the most monarchist speeches a Canadian prime minister has given since John Diefenbaker."

[...] Regarding the chorus of the song, Millard said [...] "the whole idea of the chorus and the sense that it brings in, with the tons of voices singing, is the fact that there's a day thats going to come when we are going to worship and be as one." ...|$|E
