40|$|Abstract — Though {{enormous}} improvement {{has occurred}} in the field of <b>transmission</b> <b>media</b> <b>layer</b> for which gigantic amount of data can be transferred but there is bottleneck problem at the upper layer protocol stack so that eventually the data transmission process becomes slower. Data may be transferred by optical fiber as a physical media which have large bandwidth but at the intermediary system the O-E-O process is accomplished for routing purpose which makes the system slower. At the intermediate nodes there are also buffering problem for this conversion. So beneath the IP layer a process called MPLS is proposed for removing the extra processing at the intermediary system. At the optical layer the point-to-point WDM technology is enhanced with light path known as wavelength routing resolves O-E-O processing and buffering problem. It also enhanced the node processing capability and protocol transparency. There is also a challenge of wavelength assignment for the limitation of wavelength. So, a wavelength routing algorithm is used for the purpose of wavelength assignment and route selection various important concerns still need to be addressed regarding IP/WDM integration. This include light path routing coupled with tighter inter networking with IP routing and resource management protocols, survivability provisioning, framing / monitoring solutions and others...|$|E

High-speed links using different predetermined <b>transmission</b> <b>media</b> {{have been demonstrated}} in the past [1 - 3]. This, however, restricts user's ability to use an integrated link interface with other <b>transmission</b> <b>media</b> once the chip is fabricated. For example, traditional transceivers for copper interconnects typically transmit baseband data, which is incompatible with a free-space wireless channel that is bandpass in nature and often uses RF carriers. A multi-modality transceiver block compatible with different <b>transmission</b> <b>media</b> is highly desirable as it offers great versatility by allowing the exact same interface circuitry {{to be used with}} different <b>transmission</b> <b>media.</b> Such a versatile interface can relax the board and system design requirements and enable the reuse of the same transceiver core with different media, reducing the time and cost overhead of re-designing and re-manufacturing...|$|R

The complex mechanical interaction between blood flow and wall dynamics in a three-dimensional arch model of an aorta was studied by means of computational coupled fluid-structure interaction analysis. The results show that stresses in the <b>media</b> <b>layer</b> are highest in three layers and that shear stress is concentrated in the <b>media</b> <b>layer</b> near to the adventitia layer. Hence, the difference in the elastic properties of the layers could be responsible for the pathological state in which a tear splits across the tunica media to near to the tunica adventitia and the dissection spreads along the laminar planes of the <b>media</b> <b>layer</b> where it is near the adventitia layer...|$|R

The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate quantitative changes and HSP 70 expression of irradiated neck recipient vessels and transplant vessels used for microsurgical anastomoses. Methods Of 20 patients included in this study five patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiation, another five received conventional radiotherapy and 10 patients where treated without previous radiotherapy. During surgical procedure, vessel specimens where obtained by the surgeon. Immunhistochemical staining of HSP 70 was performed and quantitative measurement and evaluation of HSP 70 was carried out. Results Conventional radiation and neoadjuvant chemoradiation revealed in a thickening of the intima layer of recipient vessels. A increased expression of HSP 70 could be detected in the <b>media</b> <b>layer</b> of the recipient veins as well as in the transplant veins of patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Radiation and chemoradiation decreased the HSP 70 expression of the intima layer in recipient arteries. Conventional radiation led to a decrease of HSP 70 expression in the <b>media</b> <b>layer</b> of recipient arteries. Conclusion Our results showed that anticancer drugs can lead to a thickening of the intima layer of transplant and recipient veins and also increase the HSP 70 expression in the <b>media</b> <b>layer</b> of the recipient vessels. In contrast, conventional radiation decreased the HSP 70 expression in the intima layer of arteries and the <b>media</b> <b>layer</b> of recipient arteries and veins. Comparing these results with wall thickness, it was concluded, that high levels of HSP 70 may prevent the intima layer of arteries and the <b>media</b> <b>layer</b> of vein from thickening. </p...|$|R
