40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: T 2 {{relaxation}} times {{provide a}} continuous measure {{of changes in}} intervertebral disk biochemistry. The purpose of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> was to <b>correlate</b> <b>T</b> 2 relaxation times in lumbar disks with patient age and stage of degeneration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sagittal T 1 - and T 2 -weighted images and axial images were acquired in 20 patients referred for MR imaging for back pain or radiculopathy. Two readers inspected these images and assigned a Pfirrmann grade to each disk. An additional sagittal multiecho FSE image sequence was obtained, and T 2 relaxation times were calculated for a each lumbar disk. T 2 relaxation times were correlated with Pfirrmann grade. T 2 relaxation times in nondegenerated disks were correlated with patient age. Statistical significance was tested by ANOVA, ad hoc tests, and Pearson coefficients. RESULTS: T 2 relaxation times were calculated for 95 lumbar disks in 19 patients and discarded for 5 disks in 1 patient due to motion artifacts. Forty-four disks were classified as Pfirrmann grade II; 34, as grade III; 14, as grade IV; and 3, as grade V. Mean T 2 relaxation times of the central region decreased from 108 ms for grade II to 53 ms for grade IV disks. T 2 relaxation times correlated significantly with Pfirrmann grade. For grade II disks, T 2 relaxation times of the central region decreased significantly {{from an average of}} 132 ms for patients in their 20 s to 86 ms for those in their 60 s...|$|R
