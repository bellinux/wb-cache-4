Instead, the train would stop immediately after passing Necropolis Junction, and the carriages would be uncoupled from the engine. A team of black horses would then haul the carriages down the sloping branch line to the two cemetery stations. While the train was on the branch line the engine would be repositioned so as to be at the front of the train once the horses drew it back out of the branch and onto the main line.|$|E

Michaline Babich, executive producer, commented that Alex was okay with the comments and that Alex, Babich, and other executive producers decided to keep the bi-phobic comments in the show to bring awareness to bisexuality and bisexual discrimination. Babich also commented, [...] "Girls give each other a hard time if they smoke or wear <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> lipstick.

2500|$|The basic {{knitted fabric}} (as in the diagram, and usually called a {{stocking}} or stockinette pattern) has a definite [...] "right side" [...] and [...] "wrong side". [...] On the right side, the visible {{portions of the}} loops are the verticals connecting two rows which are arranged in a grid of V shapes. [...] On <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> side, <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the loops are visible, both the tops and bottoms, creating a much more bumpy texture sometimes called reverse stockinette. (Despite being the [...] "wrong side," [...] reverse stockinette is frequently used as a pattern in its own right.) [...] Because the yarn holding rows together is all on the front, and the yarn holding side-by-side stitches together is all on the back, stockinette fabric has a strong tendency to curl toward the front {{on the top and}} bottom, and toward the back on the left and right side.|$|R

Somerset's season began brightly, including a county-record 850/7 declared against Middlesex in their first Championship match, but {{a few weeks later}} Somerset were on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a huge total when they conceded 801/8 declared to Derbyshire. However, they recovered well from this set-back and achieved promotion, returning to Division One of the Championship {{for the first time since}} 2002, after beating Essex at Chelmsford with five sessions to spare. They were also promoted to Division One of the Pro40 league.|$|E
25|$|Despite the defeat, Ferguson {{was back}} in the ring shortly afterwards. He was matched against Mercer yet again, who this time came in shape at 223. Although the fight was closer, Ferguson still {{appeared}} to outpunch Mercer and get the better of him. Once again Ferguson was on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a close decision as Mercer was awarded a split decision that was even jeered by his hometown crowd at Atlantic City. In 1994 Ferguson travelled to the U.K. to fight Frank Bruno, who was returning after his loss to Lennox Lewis. The overweight Ferguson collapsed in one round in a passionless performance. A year later Bruno would outpoint Oliver McCall and win the WBC heavyweight title.|$|E
60|$|L. No; of bronze, or copper, or some {{of their}} foul patent metal--it is no matter what. I meant a model of our chief British eagle. Every feather was made separately; and every {{filament}} of every feather separately, and so joined on; and all the quills modelled of the right length and right section, and at last the whole cluster of them fastened together. You know, children, I don't think much of my own drawing; but take my proud word for once, that when I go to the Zoological Gardens, and {{happen to have a}} bit of chalk in my pocket, and the Gray Harpy will sit, without screwing his head round, for thirty seconds,--I can do a better thing of him in that time than the three years' work of this industrious firm. For, during the thirty seconds, the eagle is my object,--not myself; and during the three years, the firm's object, in every fibre of bronze it made, was itself, and not the eagle. That is the true meaning of the little Pthah's having no eyes--he can see only himself. The Egyptian beetle was not quite the full type of him; our northern ground beetle is a truer one. It is beautiful to see it at work, gathering its treasures (such as they are) into little round balls; and pushing them home with <b>the</b> strong <b>wrong</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> it,--head downmost all the way,--like a modern political economist with his ball of capital, declaring that a nation can stand on its vices better than on its virtues. But away with you, children, now, for I'm getting cross.|$|R
6000|$|... "What liberty?" [...] Nick looked now quite {{innocent}} of care, and indeed his visitor's allusion was not promptly clear. He was thinking for the instant all of Biddy, of whom and whose secret inclinations Grace {{had insisted on}} talking to him. They were none of his business, and if he wouldn't for the world have let the girl herself suspect he had violent lights on what was most screened and curtained in her, much less would he have made Peter a clumsy present of this knowledge. Grace had a queer theory that Peter treated Biddy badly--treated them all somehow badly; but Grace's zeal (she had plenty of it, though she affected all sorts of fine indifference) almost always {{took the form of}} her being unusually wrong. Nick wanted to do only what Biddy would thank him for, and he knew very well what she wouldn't. She wished him and Peter to be great friends, and the only obstacle to this was that Peter {{was too much of a}} diplomatist. Peter made him for an instant think of her and of the hour they had lately spent together in the studio in his absence--an hour of which Biddy had given him a history full of items and omissions; and this in turn brought Nick's imagination back to his visitor's own side of the matter. That general human complexity of which the sense had lately increased with him, and to which it was owing that any thread one might take hold of would probably be <b>the</b> extremely <b>wrong</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> something, was illustrated by the fact that while poor Biddy was thinking of Peter it was ten to one poor Peter was thinking of Miriam Rooth. All of which danced before Nick's intellectual vision for a space briefer than my too numerous words.|$|R

25|$|In 1981, Belize {{exploded}} into internal turmoil with the Heads of Agreement uprisings in March, and Amandala offered full coverage of events as they unfolded, making its name well known throughout the nation. Toward {{the end of}} 1981, it published an article linking Prime Minister Price and Minister Louis Sylvester to a report from Mexico about drugs in Belize. For {{the second time in}} its publishing life, Amandala went to court on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> lawsuits for libel, and was hit with separate judgements for BZ $10,000 and BZ $7,500 in 1982 and 1983. These debts crippled the newspaper but Amandala fought on. Relief arrived briefly with the ascension of the UDP to power in 1984, but the UDP and Amandala soon found themselves at loggerheads.|$|E
25|$|Ince was {{expected}} to retire {{at the end of}} the 2004–05 season, but he changed his mind halfway through the season following the appointment of Glenn Hoddle as manager of a Wolves side who were struggling at <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the league. Wolves climbed up to ninth in the final table, proving themselves very hard to beat under Hoddle's management, although they drew too many games to be able to make a late run to the playoff places. In June 2005, he signed a new one-year contract with Wolves. In April 2006, he announced that he wanted to continue playing for Wolves for a further season after speaking with his close friend Teddy Sheringham. However, following Ince's failure to get the manager's job at Wolves in July 2006 on Hoddle's resignation, the newly appointed manager, Mick McCarthy, decided not to offer Ince a new contract. Upon leaving, Ince declared his intention to return, at some point in the future, as manager of Wolves.|$|E
25|$|They {{would remain}} outside the top flight {{for the next}} 12 years, {{although}} they did qualify for the play-offs under Bassett's successor Howard Kendall in 1997 and caretaker manager Steve Thompson in 1998. They were struggling at <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Division One when Neil Warnock was appointed manager in December 1999, and a financial crisis was preventing the club {{from being able to}} boost their squad, but in 2002–03 they enjoyed their most successful season for a decade, reaching the semi-finals of both domestic cups and also reaching the Division One play-off final, where they were beaten 3–0 by Wolverhampton Wanderers. Three years later, however, Warnock delivered a Premier League return as the Blades finished runners-up in the rebranded Championship. They lasted just one season back amongst the elite, before being relegated from the Premier League amidst the controversy surrounding Carlos Tevez, the player who was controversially signed by West Ham United and whose performances played a big part in their remarkable escape from relegation. Neil Warnock resigned as manager after the Blades went down.|$|E

500|$|Some reviews {{were less}} favorable. David Ansen of Newsweek said, [...] "While one respects the filmmaker's small-is-beautiful philosophy, this story {{may indeed be}} too small for its britches.... Beresford's nice little movie seems so afraid to make a false move that it runs the danger of not moving at all." [...] Linda Beath of The Globe and Mail said Duvall's {{performance}} was [...] "fabulous," [...] but that the film was [...] "very slight" [...] compared to Beresford's Australian pictures. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post panned the film, criticizing its mood and tempo and describing Buckley as its only true asset: [...] "Tender Mercies fails because of an apparent dimness of perception that frequently overcomes dramatists: they don't always know when they've got ahold of <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the story they want to tell." ...|$|E

In 2005, {{the suggestion of}} a reunion for the 1987 team was met with uncomfortable silence and [...] "I don't think so" [...] from Hockey Canada officials. Immediately following the tournament, Canadian officials were seen as trying to distance themselves from the team: [...] "The CAHA (Canadian Amateur Hockey Association) didn't do anything for these kids", reporter Jim Cressman said. [...] "These kids were good enough to make this team. They gave up their holidays, did their best, risked getting hurt and ended up on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a bad decision - and the CAHA basically handed them their tickets." [...] Winnipeg Jets assistant general manager Mike Smith was in the Vienna airport while the Canadian juniors were waiting for their flight, and took the opportunity to criticize them for their play at the tournament as well as the brawl.|$|E

500|$|Former {{team captain}} Andy Hessenthaler was {{appointed}} player-manager, having previously served as player-coach, {{and led the}} club to league finishes of 13th, 12th and 11th in his first three seasons in charge. [...] In contrast, the 2003–04 season saw the club escape relegation by the narrowest of margins, with a last day goalless draw keeping Gillingham above Walsall on goal difference, with just one goal separating the two teams. [...] John Gorman was appointed to help Hessenthaler as the side started the 2004–05 season poorly, but as the team continued to struggle at <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the table Hessenthaler resigned as manager in late November. Somewhat unusually he continued to be employed as a player. [...] Gorman succeeded Hessenthaler in a caretaker capacity but left the club to take the manager's job at Wycombe Wanderers. [...] Gillingham then appointed former Burnley boss Stan Ternent as manager, but despite a late run of positive results, he couldn't prevent the Gills' relegation to League One {{on the last day}} of the season. [...] In a reversal of the previous season's fortunes, Crewe Alexandra, the team immediately above Gillingham in the table, survived by just one goal.|$|E
500|$|The {{third round}} draw for the FA Cup paired Argyle with Newcastle United, which left {{assistant}} manager John Carver with mixed emotions. Neither side could break the deadlock {{in a competitive}} contest at Home Park. Argyle striker Rory Fallon forced a good save from Tim Krul before the visitors had chances of their own, the majority of which went to Fabrice Pancrate. Newcastle looked likely {{to win the game}} late on but were denied by goalkeeper Romain Larrieu, who tipped a looping volley from Nicky Butt over the crossbar. The match saw the return of Chris Barker to the Argyle defence after a lengthy spell on the sidelines because of injury, and manager Paul Mariner was full of praise for his performance. [...] "For him to come and do what he did against such a high powered, attacking team as Newcastle and playing 90 plus minutes was pretty remarkable. He's a very strong character and very experienced." [...] The replay at St James' Park was Argyle's next match due to the wintry weather, and they were on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a 3–0 scoreline. Newcastle striker Peter Løvenkrands gave the home side a two-goal lead at half-time and completed his hat-trick after 72 minutes. [...] "His timing of his runs is pretty special and for the first goal, his finish was fantastic," [...] said Mariner. The match on Tyneside was to be the last in an Argyle shirt for Cillian Sheridan who returned to Celtic in Scotland the next day when his loan spell with the club finished, having made 13 appearances, scoring no goals.|$|E
