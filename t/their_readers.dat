5|$|Reviewers {{recommended}} the original ZX Spectrum Underwurlde release. They noted its expansive game world and appreciated the parts where Sabreman travelled by bubble. Later critics {{commented on the}} game's frustrating difficulty. While the Commodore 64 version {{was similar to the}} original, reviews were mixed—one critic thought the title had aged poorly in the year between releases. Your Sinclair placed Underwurlde within its top 20 for the ZX Spectrum, though <b>their</b> <b>readers</b> put it near the bottom of their top 100. The game was later included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E

5|$|The Malay Archipelago {{attracted}} many reviews, {{with interest}} from scientific, geographic, church and general periodicals. Reviewers noted and sometimes disagreed with various of his theories, especially {{the division of}} fauna and flora along what soon {{became known as the}} Wallace line, natural selection and uniformitarianism. Nearly all agreed that he had provided an interesting and comprehensive account of the geography, natural history, and peoples of the archipelago, which was little known to <b>their</b> <b>readers</b> at the time, and that he had collected an astonishing number of specimens. The book is much cited, and is Wallace's most successful, both commercially and as a piece of literature.|$|E

25|$|Authors of such {{novels are}} {{also able to}} receive {{feedbacks}} and new ideas from <b>their</b> <b>readers</b> through e-mails or online feedback channels.

25|$|Khaled Diab {{argues that}} Muslims cannot impose their own values on {{people of other}} faiths. Freedom of {{expression}} should permit people to express whatever opinions they have, {{even if they are}} offensive, he argues.

25|$|The {{abuse that}} Beckham was {{receiving}} from English supporters peaked during England's 3–2 defeat by Portugal in Euro 2000, a match where Beckham set up two goals, {{when a group}} of England supporters taunted him throughout the match.

25|$|Some NESARA detractors {{claim that}} NESARA is a cult {{designed}} primarily {{to provide an}} income to Goodwin and others. They {{point to the fact}} that Goodwin, Lee, and Nidle frequently asked <b>their</b> <b>readers</b> to donate money. Goodwin, who also asked readers to donate their frequent flyer miles, claimed that she needed and had used the funds to travel to various locations around the world to secretly meet with high-level government officials about getting NESARA announced.|$|E

25|$|Some {{writers in}} their manner and stance {{intentionally}} provoke challenge and criticism from <b>their</b> <b>readers.</b> Others just {{invite you to}} think. Baudrillard's hyperprose demands only that you grunt wide-eyed or bewildered assent. He yearns to have intellectual influence, but must fend off any serious analysis of his own writing, remaining free to leap from one bombastic assertion to the next, no matter how brazen. Your place is simply to buy his books, adopt his jargon, and drop his name wherever possible.|$|E
40|$|In {{this letter}} to the editor, Michael Cross takes up an issue with The Springfield News about their {{apparent}} support for librarian’s worried about censorship. He then challenges the newspaper to print portions of the books that are being challenged and have <b>their</b> <b>reader</b> base exposed to the contents of these works. He challenges that they won’t do it because <b>their</b> <b>reader</b> base couldn’t handle it. He then makes a claim that the newspaper will not print letters that pertain to national issues even if they pertain to the reading audience. The editor replied back with a statement saying the newspaper {{does not have a}} policy about printing letters about national issues. It does give preference to letters about local and state issues...|$|R

25|$|Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University {{thinks that}} {{leaflets}} {{that can only}} contain a relatively short text are unlikely to convince <b>their</b> <b>readers</b> and as such are ineffective in comparison to, for instance, radio programs. Professor Lee Jung-hoon from Yonsei University is not convinced that an organization such as North Korean People's Liberation Front is able to truly destabilize the North Korean regime, whatever methods they used, {{as they would have}} challenges trying to infiltrate North Korean society and posing {{as an alternative to the}} regime.|$|E
25|$|The {{prominence}} of failed prophecy also lends {{support to the}} cult theory. NESARA supporters often tell <b>their</b> <b>readers</b> that the NESARA announcement {{is going to happen}} in a matter of days. These claims have been made too many times to enumerate, without ever coming to fruition. According to the documentary Waiting For NESARA, the claim was also made prior to March 2003 that George Bush was planning the war with Iraq only to further delay the NESARA announcement. It was prophesied that spiritual beings and UFOs would intervene with Bush's plans and prevent the war.|$|E
25|$|The Frankfurt School avoided {{taking a}} stand on the precise {{relationship}} between the materialist and transcendental methods, which led to ambiguity in their writings and confusion among <b>their</b> <b>readers.</b> Habermas's epistemology synthesizes these two traditions by showing that phenomenological and transcendental analysis can be subsumed under a materialist theory of social evolution, while the materialist theory makes sense only {{as part of a}} quasi-transcendental theory of emancipatory knowledge that is the self-reflection of cultural evolution. The simultaneously empirical and transcendental nature of emancipatory knowledge becomes the foundation stone of critical theory.|$|E
