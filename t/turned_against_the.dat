5|$|Alexander I Aldea (14311436) was {{the first}} Romanian ruler {{to be forced to}} render {{military}} service to the Ottomans. Two decades later, Vlad III the Impaler (1448, 14561462, 1476), notorious as the model for the Dracula legend, <b>turned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman Empire. He carried out a series of attacks across the Danube in the winter of 14611462. The response was a massive invasion led by Mehmed II who drove Vlad III from the throne and replaced him with his brother, Radu III the Fair (14621475). Due to the frequent military operations, the Wallachian Plain was heavily depopulated {{after the end of the}} 14thcentury. On the other hand, Wallachia received a steady flow of immigrants, mostly from the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the attack}} on his family, Captain Pipe {{said that he would}} not seek vengeance. Instead, in September 1778, {{he was one of the}} signers of the Treaty of Fort Pitt between the Delawares and the United States. Americans hoped this {{agreement}} with the Delawares would enable American soldiers to pass through Delaware territory and attack Detroit, but the alliance deteriorated after the death of White Eyes, the Delaware chief who had negotiated the treaty. Eventually, Captain Pipe <b>turned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Americans and moved his followers west to the Sandusky River, where he received support from the British in Detroit.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union in 1941, the tide gradually <b>turned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Nazis, who suffered major military defeats in 1943. Large-scale aerial bombing of Germany escalated in 1944 and the Axis powers were pushed back in Eastern and Southern Europe. Following the Allied {{invasion of}} France, Germany was conquered by the Soviet Union from {{the east and the}} other Allied powers from the west and capitulated within a year. Hitler's refusal to admit defeat led to massive destruction of German infrastructure and additional war-related deaths in the closing months of the war. The victorious Allies initiated a policy of denazification and put many of the surviving Nazi leadership on trial for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials.|$|E

5|$|In August 1814, British forces {{attacked}} Washington, D.C. {{and burned}} the White House.

5|$|In early 1643, Parliament placed Newark under siege, and the {{garrison}} at Ashby {{was sent to}} relieve it.

He started a campaign against the Turks {{in the autumn of}} 1594, conquering several citadels near the Danube, including Giurgiu, Brăila, Hârşova, and Silistra, while his Moldavian allies defeated the Turks in Iaşi and other parts of Moldavia. Mihai continued his attacks deep within the Ottoman Empire, taking the forts of Nicopolis, Ribnic, and Chilia and even reaching as far as Adrianople.|$|E

5|$|The Song dynasty {{was founded}} by Zhao Kuangyin (Emperor Taizu) (r. 960–976) in 960, before the Song {{completely}} reunified China proper by conquest—excluding only the Sixteen Prefectures. The Song fought a series of wars with the Liao dynasty (1125–1279), ruled by the Khitans, over the possession of the Sixteen Prefectures of northern China. The Liao regime was toppled in 1125 in a joint conquest by Song forces and the Jurchens led by Wuqimai (Emperor Taizong) (r. 1123–1134). However, the Jin quickly <b>turned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Song and invaded Song's northern territory.

5|$|This {{painting}} is considered among Matejko's most famous works {{and is also}} one of his largest canvases. It portrays an event of significant political triumph for Poland, the Prussian Homage, in which Poland was able to enforce its will over Prussia. Prussia latter gained independence and <b>turned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, becoming one of the nations that divided Poland among them. Matejko's painting was created during the partition period, when independent Poland had ceased to exist, and like many of Matejko's other works, it aimed to remind the Polish people of their most famous historical triumphs.|$|E
5|$|When the English Civil War {{broke out}} in 1642, Portland was {{initially}} controlled by Parliamentary forces. The castle was captured in 1643 {{by a group of}} Royalists who gained access by pretending to be Parliamentary soldiers. As the war <b>turned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> King in the south-west, Parliamentary forces besieged the castle for four months in 1644, and once again the following year. The castle finally surrendered to Vice-Admiral William Batten in April 1646. It is uncertain why the castle, which was not easily defensible on the landward side, proved so difficult to take; the historian Peter Harrington has suggested that its low-lying position may have made it difficult for Parliament to bombard it from the sea.|$|E
5|$|As the war <b>turned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Austrians, the {{garrison}} in Bologna left {{early in the}} morning on 12 June 1859. By the end of the same day the papal colours flying in the squares had been replaced with the Italian green, white and red, the cardinal legate had left the city, and a group styling itself Bologna's provisional government had proclaimed its desire to join the Kingdom of Sardinia. Bologna was promptly incorporated as part of the province of Romagna. The Archbishop Michele Viale-Prelà attempted to persuade the citizenry not to co-operate with the new civil authorities, but had little success. One of the new order's first official acts was to introduce freedom of religion and make all citizens equal before the law. In November 1859 the governor Luigi Carlo Farini issued a proclamation abolishing the inquisition.|$|E

The by-election, scheduled for 9 February, was contested by – in addition to the major political parties in Scotland – an Abolish Forth Bridge Tolls Party. It was won by Liberal Democrat candidate Willie Rennie, overturning a large Labour majority on a 16% swing. In the aftermath of the by-election defeat, media speculation suggested the Executive had <b>turned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> proposals, and Tavish Scott eventually confirmed their rejection and the retention of the existing toll structure on 1 March 2006. FETA condemned the decision, while local opposition MSPs charged the minister that his tolling review short-changed Fifers as tolls were axed on the Erskine Bridge leaving tolls on only the Forth and Tay Road Bridge.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1842, {{popular opinion}} had <b>turned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Mormons. After an unknown assailant shot and wounded Missouri {{governor}} Lilburn Boggs in May 1842, anti-Mormons circulated rumors that Smith's bodyguard, Porter Rockwell, was the shooter. Though {{the evidence was}} circumstantial, Boggs ordered Smith's extradition. Certain he would be killed if he ever returned to Missouri, Smith went into hiding twice during the next five months, before the U.S. district attorney for Illinois argued that Smith's extradition to Missouri would be unconstitutional. (Rockwell was later tried and acquitted.) In June 1843, enemies of Smith convinced a reluctant Illinois Governor Thomas Ford to extradite Smith to Missouri on an old charge of treason. Two law officers arrested Smith, but were intercepted by a party of Mormons before they could reach Missouri. Smith was then released on a writ of habeas corpus from the Nauvoo municipal court. While this ended the Missourians' attempts at extradition, it caused significant political fallout in Illinois.|$|E

Fleets were gathered at the ports of Portsmouth in the south and Orwell on the east coast, and a raiding force of 1,600 men was sent across the English Channel into Normandy as a diversionary attack. Edward issued a nationalistic appeal for his subjects to defend the kingdom, but with little impact. The regime's hold on power at the local level was fragile, the Despensers were widely disliked, and many of those Edward entrusted with the defence of the kingdom proved incompetent, or promptly <b>turned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> regime. Some 2,000 men were ordered to gather at Orwell to repel any invasion, but only 55 appear to have actually arrived.|$|E
