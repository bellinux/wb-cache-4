40|$|People {{generally}} tend {{to advance}} gains and postpone losses in intertemporal choice. Jiang, Hu, and Zhu (2014) recently showed that adding upfront <b>losses</b> <b>or</b> <b>gains</b> to both smaller and sooner (SS) and larger and later (LL) rewards can decrease people’s discounting. To {{account for this}} decrease, they proposed the salience hypothesis, which states that introducing upfront <b>losses</b> <b>or</b> <b>gains</b> makes the money dimension more salient than not, thus increasing people’s preference for LL rewards. Considering that decreasing the discounting of delayed losses is imperative and that most previous {{studies have focused on}} intertemporal choices with gains, in the current paper we conducted two experiments and used hypothetical money outcomes to examine whether the effect of upfront money could be extended to intertemporal choices with losses. The results showed that when both SS and LL intertemporal losses were combined with an upfront <b>loss</b> <b>or</b> <b>gain,</b> people’s discounting rate decreased and the preference for the SS option increased. This finding further supports the salience account...|$|R

This study, utilizing data from Korean manufacturing-sector SMEs, explores whether cooperative social value orientations of SMEs’ BSIs influence the effects of collaborative buyer-supplier initiatives. The results suggested that the performance implication of decision-sharing initiative increases when BSIs have a high level of cooperative social value orientation.

40|$|Telomeres, the {{terminal}} chromosomal structure crucial for maintaining genomic integrity, shorten with deoxyribonucleic acid replications in most human somatic cells. Chromosomes carrying critically short telomeres tend to form end-to-end fusions, which {{are subject to}} breakage during cell division. However, it remains obscure how such telomere-mediated fusions are resolved {{during the process of}} immortalization, which is an early and indispensable step toward cancer. It has been hypothesized that the breakage could occur at either the microtubule or chromatid, causing numerical or structural chromosome instability, respectively. In this paper, we show that although the distributions of chromosomal segment <b>losses</b> <b>or</b> <b>gains</b> involved in structural aberrations were significantly correlated with the profiles of critically short telomeres in human epithelial cells undergoing immortalization, no such association was detected for whole-chromosome <b>losses</b> <b>or</b> <b>gains</b> in either metaphase or interphase cells. By distinguishing between homologues, we further showed that the specific homologues with critically short telomeres and frequent end-to-end fusions were not preferentially involved in respective whole-chromosome <b>losses</b> <b>or</b> <b>gains.</b> Our data therefore demonstrate that microtubule breakage is not a major mechanism for resolving chromosomal end-to-end fusions in human cells undergoing immortalization. An important implication of this finding is that microtubule-kinetochore attachment is stronger than the chromosome structure. © Springer-Verlag 2007. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
