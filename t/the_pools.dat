5|$|An ephemeral/fluctuating pool natural {{community}} {{known as}} the Edgewood Vernal Pools is located on and near Nescopeck Mountain. It consists of dozens of vernal pools created by glaciation. Numerous amphibian species breed in <b>the</b> <b>pools</b> and hardwood trees and hemlock are present on {{the southern edge of}} the pool system. A globally rare species of invertebrate was observed in <b>the</b> <b>pools</b> in 1990. Another system of vernal pools {{known as the}} Briggsville Vernal Pools are found north of the ridge.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 {{an appeal}} to raise £3 million was {{launched}} to restore <b>the</b> <b>pools.</b> The fundraising has been supported by The Prince's Trust. The project aims not just to preserve the existing architecture, but also to reopen it as an outdoor lido. This is hampered by poor access to the site {{and the possibility of}} flooding. It is intended to make the work sustainable and environmentally friendly, with renewable sources of energy including water source heat pumps using latent heat from the River Avon. A small landing stage is being proposed to enable access to <b>the</b> <b>pools</b> from river craft.|$|E
5|$|In the Georgian period Bath {{had grown}} in {{popularity}} as a spa town. The opening of Pulteney Bridge enabled {{the development of}} Bathwick and land {{to the east of}} the River Avon. <b>The</b> <b>pools</b> were built next to the river on the site of old marl pits. The developers went bankrupt ten years after opening <b>the</b> <b>pools</b> but they were sold had operated privately until they were taken over by the local corporation in the 1890s. They then operated as a public swimming baths until the 1970s. The pool closed in 1984 and was used for a short time as a trout farm before closure and falling into disrepair. In 2005 a trust was formed to raise funds for renovation and reopening of <b>the</b> <b>pools.</b> Public support and grants from bodies such as the Heritage Lottery Fund have aided regeneration of the site, which is expected to reopen in 2018.|$|E
50|$|In Spring 2012 the City of Austin rebuilt <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> due {{to severe}} leaking and {{cracking}} of <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> slab. Work crews removed and replaced, or capped over with new reinforced concrete, <b>the</b> entire <b>pool</b> bottom. <b>The</b> <b>pool's</b> west end was lengthened and a beach-type (zero-depth) entry was added. The project also included repair of <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> walls, widening of <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> deck, and adding new coping around <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> edge. <b>The</b> <b>pool</b> side pump house building was removed and replaced, {{and a new}} storage building {{was added to the}} east of <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b>|$|R

5|$|As the IIHF grew, more teams {{began to}} {{participate}} at the World Championships, so more pools were introduced. Pool C games were first played in 1961 and Pool D {{was introduced in}} 1987. In 2001, <b>the</b> <b>pools</b> were renamed: Pool B became Division I, Pool C became Division II and Pool D became Division III.|$|E
5|$|Species present {{all year}} round include little and great crested grebes, lapwing, redshank, tufted duck, gadwall, kingfisher, reed bunting, great spotted woodpecker, {{sparrowhawk}} and little owl. In the spring, passage waders visit <b>the</b> <b>pools</b> alongside the estuary; these include whimbrel, common, wood and green sandpipers, spotted redshank, common greenshank, avocet, godwit, little gull and black tern, and other migrants arriving at the reserve include wheatear, whinchat, redstart and black redstart.|$|E
5|$|The mounded prairie {{region is}} located {{on top of the}} plateaus, {{characterized}} by many species grasses and wildflowers around the vernal pools, with mounds of soil created by erosion. The dwarf woolly meadowfoam, a plant endemic to the Table Rocks, grows near these pools. They bloom for about ten days in April. When filled in the winter and early spring, <b>the</b> <b>pools</b> are also a known habitat for the vernal pool fairy shrimp (Branchinecta lynchi), a threatened species.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pool</b> Water Treatment and Cooling System {{is located}} in the Waste Handling Building (WHB), and is {{comprised}} of various process subsystems designed to support waste handling operations. This system maintains <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> water temperature within an acceptable range, maintains water quality standards that support remote underwater operations and prevent corrosion, detects leakage from <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> liner, provides <b>the</b> capability to remove debris from <b>the</b> <b>pool,</b> controls <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> water level, and helps limit radiological exposure to personnel. <b>The</b> <b>pool</b> structure and liner, <b>pool</b> lighting, and <b>the</b> fuel staging racks in <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> are not within the scope of <b>the</b> <b>Pool</b> Water Treatment and Cooling System. Pool water temperature control is accomplished by circulating <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> water through heat exchangers. Adequate circulation and mixing of <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> water is provided to prevent localized thermal hotspots in <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> Treatment of <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> water is accomplished by a water treatment system that circulates <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> water through filters, and ion exchange units. These water treatment units remove radioactive and non-radioactive particulate and dissolved solids from the water, thereby providing the water clarity needed to conduct waste handling operations. The system also controls pool water chemistry to prevent advanced corrosion of <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> liner, pool components, and fuel assemblies. Removal of radioactivity from <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> water contributes to the project ALARA (as low as is reasonably achievable) goals. A leak detection system is provided to detect and alarm leaks through <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> liner. <b>The</b> <b>pool</b> level control system monitors the water level to ensure that the minimum water level required for adequate radiological shielding is maintained. Through interface with a demineralized water system, adequate makeup is provided to compensate for loss of water inventory through evaporation and waste handling operations. Interface with the Site Radiological Monitoring System provides continuous radiological monitoring of <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> water. <b>The</b> <b>Pool</b> Water Treatment and Cooling System interfaces with the Waste Handling Building System, Site-Generated Radiological Waste Handling System, Site Radiological Monitoring System, Waste Handling Building Electrical System, Site Water System, and the Monitored Geologic Repository Operations Monitoring and Control System...|$|R

5000|$|Water is {{typically}} drawn from <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> via a rectangular aperture in the wall, connected {{through to a}} device fitted into one (or more) wall/s of <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> <b>The</b> internals of the skimmer are accessed from <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> deck through a circular or rectangle lid, about one foot in diameter. If <b>the</b> <b>pool's</b> water pump is operational water is drawn from <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> over a floating hinged weir (operating from a vertical position to 90 degrees angle away from <b>the</b> <b>pool,</b> {{in order to stop}} leaves and debris being back-flooded into <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> by wave action), and down into a removable [...] "skimmer basket", the purpose of which is to entrap leaves, dead insects and other larger floating debris.|$|R
5|$|Throughout the campus, {{numerous}} fountains provide {{white noise}} as a background.

5|$|Four {{overlapping}} ecological regions {{have been}} identified on the Table Rocks, with considerable differences in the variety of wildlife found in each. From the outermost base of the rocks, three regions consisting of oak savanna, chaparral, and mixed woodland surround the relatively flat tops. The andesite cap is covered by the fourth region, mounded prairie. This region formed when the caps were slowly eroded by the freezing and thawing of water that seeped into the ground (ice erosion), which created layers of mounded soil. Vernal pools fill in from October to June in the mounded prairie area due to the andesite's impermeability. <b>The</b> <b>pools</b> support species of plants and animals.|$|E
5|$|The {{buildings}} in the southeast were scarcely affected by the 19th century restoration apart from the chapel. Many of {{the walls of the}} 12th century tower have survived, partly rebuilt in the 15th century, and there are traces of a Romanesque chapel. The park was redesigned in the 19th century, enclosed in dry stone walls with several entrances. These have since been removed, as have the luxuriant gardens of the 18th century. Some traces remain in the form of boxwood, some alleys, <b>the</b> <b>pools</b> on the two terraces and the rockery.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>pool</b> {{is usually}} {{open to the}} public from 5:00am to 10:00pm, Friday through Wednesday. During this time, the {{floodgates}} on <b>the</b> <b>pool's</b> dam are closed, and Main Barton Spring fills <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> to a maximum depth of more than 18 feet.

5|$|The {{rocks are}} home to over 70 species of animals and 340 species of plants, which {{includes}} over 200 species of wildflowers. Vernal pools atop the plateaus fill {{during the rainy season}} in winter and spring because the andesite is impermeable. The dwarf woolly meadowfoam, a species of wildflower, grows around these pools, and is endemic to the rocks. <b>The</b> <b>pools</b> are also one of only a few places where the federally threatened species of fairy shrimp, Branchinecta lynchi, can be found. To protect these and other threatened species, the Bureau of Land Management has listed the rocks as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern since 1984.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} wildflower {{species in the}} uplands and rock outcroppings of the Turkey Hill Oxbow. These include white baneberry, northern maidenhair fern, spikenard, blue cohosh, foamflower, false Solomon's seal, purple trillium, and wild columbine. Animals inhabiting the areas surrounding <b>the</b> <b>pools</b> include pickerel frogs, green frogs, wood ducks, and snapping turtles. Plants in this location include broadleaf arrowhead, northern blueflag, manna grasses, water starwort, and several varieties of sedges. Japanese knotweed has been seen near Interstate 80 on the northern edges of the Turkey Hill Oxbow.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} poison dart frogs are {{dedicated}} parents. Many poison dart frogs in the genera Oophaga and Ranitomeya carry their newly hatched tadpoles into the canopy; the tadpoles {{stick to the}} mucus {{on the backs of}} their parents. Once in {{the upper reaches of the}} rainforest trees, the parents deposit their young in <b>the</b> <b>pools</b> of water that accumulate in epiphytic plants, such as bromeliads. The tadpoles feed on invertebrates in their nursery, and their mother will even supplement their diet by depositing eggs into the water. Other poison frogs lay their eggs on the forest floor, hidden beneath the leaf litter. Poison frogs fertilize their eggs externally; the female lays a cluster of eggs and a male fertilizes them afterward, in the same manner as most fish. Poison frogs can often be observed clutching each other, similar to the manner most frogs copulate. However, these demonstrations are actually territorial wrestling matches. Both males and females frequently engage in disputes over territory. A male will fight for the most prominent roosts from which to broadcast his mating call; females fight over desirable nests, and even invade the nests of other females to devour competitor's eggs.|$|E
50|$|In 1994 Aberdeenshire Council {{had plans}} to close <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> but a local {{campaign}} (Friends of Stonehaven Open Air Swimming Pool) successfully lobbied to save <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> This organisation is now a SCIO (Scottish Charitable Incorporated organisation) and works {{in partnership with the}} council.

5|$|Since {{the early}} 20thcentury, when Swan Falls Dam was {{constructed}} {{on the middle}} Snake River upstream of Hells Canyon, the fifteen dams and reservoirs on the river have posed an increasing problem for migrating salmon. Agricultural lands and their resulting runoff have also {{had a significant impact}} on the success rate of migrating fish. Salmon can travel up the Snake River as far as Hells Canyon Dam, using the fish passage facilities of the four lower Snake River dams, leaving the Clearwater, Grande Ronde and Salmon river to sustain spawning salmon. Rising in several forks in the Clearwater Mountains of central Idaho, the Clearwater and Salmon River watersheds are nearly undeveloped with the enormous exception of Dworshak Dam on the North Fork Clearwater River. The watershed of the Grande Ronde in northeastern Oregon is also largely undeveloped. The four reservoirs formed by the lower Snake River dams—Lake Sacagawea, Lake Herbert G. West, Lake Bryan, and Lower Granite Lake—have also formed problems, as the downstream current in <b>the</b> <b>pools</b> is often not enough for the fish to sense, confusing their migration routes.|$|E
5|$|There were {{attempts}} to create royal naval {{forces in the}} fifteenth century. James IV founded a harbour at Newhaven and a dockyard at <b>the</b> <b>Pools</b> of Airth. He acquired a total of 38 ships including the Great Michael, {{at that time the}} largest in Europe. Scottish ships had some success against privateers, accompanied the king on his expeditions to the islands, and intervened in Scandinavia and the Baltic, but were sold after the Flodden campaign. Scottish naval efforts subsequently relied on privateering captains and hired merchantmen. Despite truces with England there were periodic outbreaks of a guerre de course. James V built a new harbour at Burntisland in 1542. The chief use of naval power in his reign were a series of expeditions to the Isles and France. The Union of Crowns in 1603 ended conflict with England, but England's foreign policy opened up Scottish shipping to attack. In 1626 a squadron of three ships were bought and equipped for protection and there were marque fleets of privateers. In 1627, the Royal Scots Navy and privateers participated in the major expedition to Biscay. The Scots also returned to West Indies and in 1629 took part in the capture of Quebec.|$|E

5|$|Various {{types of}} aquatic {{habitats}} {{are used by}} different crocodilians. Some species are relatively more terrestrial and prefer swamps, ponds, and the edges of lakes, where they can bask {{in the sun and}} there is plenty of plant life supporting a diverse fauna. Others spend more time in the water and inhabit the lower stretches of rivers, mangrove swamps, and estuaries. These habitats also have a rich flora and provide plenty of food. The Asian gharials find the fish on which they feed in <b>the</b> <b>pools</b> and backwaters of swift rivers. South American dwarf caimans inhabit cool, fast-flowing streams, often near waterfalls, and other caimans live in warmer, turbid lakes and slow-moving rivers. The crocodiles are mainly river dwellers, and the Chinese alligator is found in slow-moving, turbid rivers flowing across China's floodplains. The American alligator is an adaptable species and inhabits swamps, rivers, or lakes with clear or turbid water. Climatic factors also affect crocodilians' distribution locally. During the dry season, caimans can be restricted to deep pools in rivers for several months; in the rainy season, much of the savannah in the Venezuelan llanos is flooded, and they disperse widely across the plain. Desert crocodiles in Mauritania have adapted to their arid environment by staying in caves or burrows in a state of aestivation during the driest periods. When it rains, the reptiles gather at gueltas.|$|E
