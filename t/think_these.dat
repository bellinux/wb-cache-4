5|$|One point {{still at}} issue is the {{position}} of Ch'olan and Q'anjobalan–Chujean. Some scholars <b>think</b> <b>these</b> form a separate Western branch (as in the diagram below). Other linguists {{do not support the}} positing of an especially close relationship between Ch'olan and Q'anjobalan–Chujean; consequently they classify these as two distinct branches emanating directly from the proto-language. An alternative proposed classification groups the Huastecan branch as springing from the Ch'olan-Tzeltalan node, rather than as an outlying branch springing directly from the proto-Mayan node.|$|E
25|$|Many {{scholars}} <b>think</b> <b>these</b> {{numbers are}} exaggerated (records are inadequate, {{they are much}} larger than those from similar societies, soldiers were paid {{by the number of}} enemies they killed and the Han dynasty had an interest in exaggerating the bloodiness of the age before China was unified). Regardless of exaggeration, it seems clear that warfare had become excessive during this period. The bloodshed and misery of the Warring States period goes a long way in explaining China's traditional preference for a united throne.|$|E
500|$|Many politicians, {{mostly from}} the Labor {{government}} of New South Wales, reacted to the security breach with concern and unease. Police Minister David Andrew Campbell expressed disappointment and concern over the stunt, arguing that there were [...] "21 world leaders arriving in the city at the one time {{and it needs to}} be taken seriously". Then New South Wales Premier Morris Iemma said that while he was a fan of the show, those involved would have to face the full force of the law. The then Federal Opposition Leader Kevin Rudd, also from the Labor Party, voiced similar concerns, saying that [...] "I'm a fan of The Chaser... but I <b>think</b> <b>these</b> guys have crossed the line." ...|$|E

At the very least, they’re forms of harassment ... We now have three parties involved. Anonymous, Scientology and law enforcement." [...] Kent stated that [...] "The hacker community has been angry at Scientology for (their) attempts to block free speech on the Internet." [...] Reaction to the denial of service attack on the Church of Scientology websites was mixed in message board forums for PC World. Some readers praised the actions of Anonymous, while others commented that the DDoS attacks bring more attention to Scientology. The Economist likened the DDoS attacks used by Project Chanology to [...] "cyberwarfare techniques normally associated with extortionists, spies and terrorists", and referred to Anonymous as [...] "internet activists".|$|E
500|$|While writing [...] "Tabula Rasa", Damon Lindelof {{suggested}} that John Locke {{was in a}} wheelchair {{before going to the}} island, and {{while the rest of the}} writing team initially reacted with shock, they embraced the idea. Lindelof wanted to embrace how [...] "what you <b>think</b> <b>these</b> people are is actually entirely different", particularly since [...] "Tabula Rasa" [...] did not have many developments on Kate's backstory or why she was a fugitive, [...] "the Locke thing was a huge, big, reveal". To enhance the plot twist, all the flashbacks were shot in a way that disguised the presence of a wheelchair. In the scene where Locke is sitting in his bed, the paralysis is alluded by the electromedical nerve stimulation machine on his nightstand. Lindelof also created a title for the episode, [...] "Lord of the Files", a pun on Lord of the Flies and Locke's off-island occupation, but the writers had already settled on [...] "Walkabout".|$|E
500|$|At {{the podium}} interview, {{conducted}} by former {{track and field}} athlete Edwin Moses, race winner Lewis Hamilton acknowledged [...] "a fantastic job by the team" [...] and expressed disappointment over the late safety car, calling it [...] "kind of an anti-climax {{when you have a}} good race like that". During the press conference after the race, Nico Rosberg accused his teammate of deliberately slowing down during the middle stint of the race and compromising his race in the process. Hamilton declared, when asked about the radio message telling him to speed up, that he [...] "wasn't controlling his [...] race, I was controlling my own race". Rosberg reacted to that statement by saying: [...] "It's just now interesting to hear from you, Lewis, that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front, and necessarily that was compromising my race." [...] Hamilton was subsequently backed up by Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda, who said: [...] "Sure, everyone drives selfish. [...] What do you <b>think</b> <b>these</b> guys are here to do? I call them egocentric bastards. That {{is the only way to}} win and the only way to win the Championship, they are all the same." ...|$|E

500|$|Founder Ted Frank {{has said}} that [...] "the whole reason I started this is {{because there is a}} high {{probability}} of district courts rubber-stamping settlements. I <b>think</b> <b>these</b> are very bad settlements that the [...] will provide guidance for when judges should or shouldn’t approve settlements.” He has also said [...] "the class action landscape has long included some “professional settlement objectors” who target large cases in hopes of extracting a percentage of the attorney fees as a reward. But that doesn’t solve the problem. The niche isn’t being filled unless you find somebody crazy like me who is willing to spend dozens of hours of his own time and hundreds of dollars of his own money to make a claim he can’t benefit from." [...] Frank said in an objection in a case at the Court of the United States District Court Northern District of Ohio of the CCAF, [...] "while the Center focuses on bringing objections to unfair class action settlements, it makes no effort to engage in quid pro quo settlements to extort attorneys, and has never settled an objection. The Center analyses complaints from consumers aggrieved by class actions settlement notices to determine whether a settlement is objectionable under the law because it favors attorneys over class members." ...|$|E
500|$|Also in 1908, Jack London {{broke his}} silence on his {{condemnation}} during the controversy by publishing {{an essay in}} Collier's Weekly entitled [...] "The Other Animals". Directly addressing Roosevelt's past criticism of his novels, London called the President [...] "homocentric" [...] and [...] "amateur". He further wrote: [...] "I have been guilty of writing two animal—two books about dogs. The writing of these two stories, on my part, was in truth a protest against the 'humanizing' of animals, of which {{it seemed to me}} several 'animal writers' had been profoundly guilty. Time and again, and many times, in my narratives, I wrote, speaking of my dog-heroes: 'He did not <b>think</b> <b>these</b> things; he merely did them,' etc. And I did this repeatedly, to the clogging of my narrative and in violation of my artistic canons; and I did it in order to hammer into the average human understanding that these dog-heroes of mine were not directed by abstract reasoning, but by instinct, sensation, and emotion, and by simple reasoning. Also, I endeavored to make my stories in line with the facts of evolution; I hewed them to the mark set by scientific research, and awoke, one day, to find myself bundled neck and crop into the camp of the nature-fakers." ...|$|E
500|$|Barkley is {{an outspoken}} {{supporter}} of gay rights. In 2006, he told Fox Sports: [...] "I'm a big advocate of gay marriage. If {{they want to}} get married, God bless them." [...] Speaking to Wolf Blitzer on CNN two years later, he said: [...] "Every time I hear the word 'conservative,' it makes me sick to my stomach, because they're really just fake Christians, as I call them. That's all they are. ... I think they want to be judge and jury. Like, I'm for gay marriage. It's none of my business if gay people want to get married. I'm pro-choice. And I <b>think</b> <b>these</b> Christians, first of all, they're not supposed to judge other people. But they're the most hypocritical judge of people we have in the country. And it bugs the hell out of me. They act like they're Christians. They're not forgiving at all." [...] During a 2011 Martin Luther King, Jr. Day double-header on TNT, Barkley responded to a statement made by Dr. King's daughter Bernice, by saying, [...] "People try to make it about black and white. [...] he talked about equality for every man, every woman. We have a thing going on now, people discriminating against homosexuality in this country. I love the homosexuality people.

500|$|Cooder {{recorded}} most of Election Special at Drive-By Studios, {{the living}} room of engineer Martin Pradler's house in North Hollywood. Sessions also took place at Wireland Studios in Chatsworth, California. Pradler later mixed and mastered the album at both recording locations. The album was produced entirely by Cooder. He performed most of the album himself, playing bass, guitar, and mandolin. His son Joachim contributed on drums, and session musician Arnold McCuller sung harmony vocals on the song [...] "Take Your Hands off It". At Drive-By Studios, Cooder recorded songs in a series of unrehearsed, single-take performances, which he felt helped him channel the songs' respective characters more efficiently. He later said of his approach to developing the songs, [...] "The way I <b>think</b> <b>these</b> songs can work is if you don't ponder over it too hard, because the tunes wanna have a spontaneous-combustion effect. What I want to do is get a certain attitude in the voice, and I can only do that once. By take two, I'm startin' to think about it. By take three, I'm startin' to map it out – it's gone. It's spoiled, y'see? So I need to get through this fast." [...] He first recorded the song [...] "The Wall Street Part of Town" [...] in November 2011. On June 7, 2012, the album's release was announced for a date in August, intended to be a week before the 2012 Republican National Convention.|$|E
500|$|Several months later, the Oxford Union invited Griffin {{to speak}} at a forum on the limits of free speech, along with other {{speakers}} including David Irving. The invitation was condemned by the Equality and Human Rights Commission head Trevor Phillips {{and the president of}} the Oxford Students' Union. The Conservative MP Dr Julian Lewis resigned his membership of the Union. A rally against the invitation was held at Oxford Town Hall on 20 November, and included the Oxford Students' Union president, the National Union of Students black students' officer, and the Trades Union Congress south east regional secretary. Representatives of Unite Against Fascism also attended, as well as the University of Oxford's Jewish student chaplain. Several Holocaust survivors spoke at the rally. Stephen Altmann-Richer, co-president of the Oxford University Jewish Society, said [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>these</b> people should be invited to the Oxford Union, by having them speak, it legitimises their views..." [...] On the night of the debate, about 50 protesters forced their way into the venue, and a crowd of hundreds gathered outside carrying banners bearing anti-racist slogans and voicing anti-BNP chants. Police blocked the entrances to the building, and removed the protesters encamped inside. Griffin was accompanied into the premises by security guards. The event was eventually split between two rooms, with Griffin speaking in one, and Irving in the other; many Union Society members were unable to gain access. Although many present found the debate objectionable, some were supportive of both Griffin and Irving's right to freedom of speech. The Oxford Union later endorsed the debate as a success.|$|E
500|$|... "Vision of Love" [...] {{has been}} lauded by {{contemporary}} music critics for its lyrical content, vocals, {{and use of}} melisma. In a retrospective review on the album in 2005, Entertainment Weekly called the song [...] "inspired" [...] and complimented Carey's use of the whistle register in the song. In 2006, Sasha Frere-Jones from The New Yorker named the song [...] "the Magna Carta of melisma" [...] for both the song's and Carey's influence on pop and R singers and American Idol contestants. Additionally, Rolling Stone said that [...] "the fluttering strings of notes that decorate songs like [...] "Vision of Love," [...] inspired the entire American Idol vocal school, for better or worse, and virtually every other female R singer since the nineties." [...] Slant Magazine critic Rich Juzwiak, wrote [...] "I think [...] was {{a vision of the}} future world of American Idol." [...] In a separate review from Slant, RJ wrote [...] "The last half of [...] "Vision Of Love" [...] (starting with the belted bridge) is a series of crescendos that get so intense that another Mariah has to step in to keep up the momentum." [...] Additionally, RJ complimented the usage of the whistle register in the song [...] "And then there's the whistle note. And then there's the final vocal run that's more like a roller-coaster track. If you <b>think</b> <b>these</b> aren't climaxes, she proves you wrong with her denouement, the way the last word, [...] "be," [...] sort of wanes into an [...] "mm hmm hmm."
