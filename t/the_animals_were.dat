5|$|Broad Ripple Park Carousel is {{an antique}} {{carousel}} in The Children's Museum of Indianapolis. It {{was installed in}} 1917 at an amusement park near the White River in Indianapolis, Indiana, where it remained until the building housing it collapsed in 1956. The ride's mechanism was destroyed, but <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> relatively unscathed and put into storage by the park's owners, the Indianapolis Department of Parks and Recreation. <b>The</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> carved by the Dentzel Carousel Company some time before 1900 but were assembled by the William F. Mangels carousel company, which also supplied the engine powering the ride.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study of}} the dietary habits of the wildebeest, <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> found to be feeding on the three {{dominant}} grasses of the area, namely : Themeda triandra, Digitaria macroblephara and Pennisetum mezianum. The time spent grazing increased by about 100% during the dry season. Though the choice of diet remained the same in both the dry and the wet season, <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> more selective during the latter.|$|E
5|$|Ice's pet wallaroo, Bucky, and pet goat, Pancho, {{escaped from}} his Port St. Lucie, Florida home in November 2004. After {{wandering}} around local streets {{for over a}} week, <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> caught and returned to Ice. He paid a $220 fine for expired pet tags and an undisclosed fine for the escape of the animals.|$|E
25|$|In most cases, the Purkinje neurons {{begin to}} die off shortly after <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> born and <b>the</b> {{condition}} <b>is</b> noticeable when <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> {{less than six}} months old, though sometimes the onset of symptoms <b>is</b> gradual and <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> much older before the owner or caretaker notices a problem.|$|R
40|$|On Feb. 15, 1954, the cadaver of a 3 -year-old female St. Bernard was {{admitted}} to Stange Memorial Clinic for diagnosis. There was a history of occasional straining and frequent scanty urination. The abdomen was greatly distended and before death <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> quite depressed. <b>The</b> owner thought <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> pregnant; however, there was no increase in mammary development. Since <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> dead on arrival there was no clinical diagnosis made...|$|R
50|$|In a judging ring, <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> will <b>be</b> walking. When <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> walking freely, <b>the</b> back hooves {{should step}} into the front hooves' footprints.|$|R
5|$|Percy Powell-Cotton {{was born}} in 1866, and was a Major in the Northumberland Fusiliers. His expeditions were {{conducted}} for scientific research, and would sometimes take 18 months. In 1896, Major Powell-Cotton founded the Powell-Cotton Museum at Quex Park to display his collection of mammals and artefacts acquired on his expeditions to Africa and Asia. <b>The</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> mounted by the noted taxidermist Rowland Ward.|$|E
5|$|Another {{indication}} that feet and other tetrapod traits evolved while <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> still aquatic {{is how they}} were feeding. They {{did not have the}} modifications of the skull and jaw that allowed them to swallow prey on land. Prey could be caught in the shallows, at the water's edge or on land, but had to be eaten in water where hydrodynamic forces from the expansion of their buccal cavity would force the food into their esophagus.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological, biogeographical, and {{linguistic}} evidence {{suggest that the}} donkey was first domesticated by nomadic pastoral people in North Africa over 5,000 years ago. <b>The</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> used to help cope with the increased aridity of the Sahara and the Horn of Africa. Genetic evidence finds that the donkey was domesticated twice based on two distinct mitochondrial DNA haplogroups. It also points to a single ancestor, the Nubian wild ass. Attempts to domesticate zebras were largely unsuccessful, though Walter Rothschild trained some to draw a carriage in England.|$|E
5000|$|After slaughter, both {{require that}} <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>be</b> {{examined}} {{to ensure that}} it is fit for consumption. Dhabiha guidelines generally say that the carcass should be inspected, while kashrut says that <b>the</b> <b>animal's</b> internal organs must be examined [...] "to make certain <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> not diseased".|$|R
50|$|The S.F.A.A. {{follows the}} rules {{imposed by the}} International Game Fish Association related to the catch and release of <b>animals.</b> <b>The</b> release of <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most {{important}} rule in <b>the</b> association, <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> not caught to not affect the marine fauna.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> an evenly light ochreous {{cream in}} color. The mantle {{is up to}} 30 mm long. <b>The</b> whole <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> up to 55 mm long.|$|R
5|$|Execution by {{elephant}} was {{a common}} method of capital punishment in South and Southeast Asia, particularly in India, where Asian elephants were used to crush, dismember, or torture captives in public executions. <b>The</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> trained and versatile, able to kill victims immediately or to torture them slowly over a prolonged period. Most commonly employed by royalty, the elephants were used to signify both the ruler's absolute power {{and his ability to}} control wild animals.|$|E
5|$|Game hunting was a {{familiar}} beneficial skill to the colonists when they immigrated to the New World. Most northern colonists depended upon hunting, whether they hunted themselves or purchased game from others. As a method of obtaining protein for consumption, hunting was preferred over animal husbandry as domestic animals were expensive and more work was required to defend domestic animals against natural predators, Native Americans, or the French. Commonly hunted game included deer, bear, buffalo, and turkey. The larger parts of <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> roasted and served with currant and other sauces, while smaller portions went into soups, stews, sausages, pies, and pasties.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Major William A. Welch ordered 75 elk from Yellowstone National Park; however, {{some had}} died en route. The {{remaining}} elk {{were kept in}} a wired cage between Arden and Southfields. By 1935, some of <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> still alive. However, by 1942, all of the elk had died. The remaining area {{is now known as}} the Elk's Pen Trailhead, which serves the Appalachian and ArdenSurebridge Trails. The remains of the pen still currently stand.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> usually black.|$|R
50|$|Spoor {{can be used}} in hunting. For example, {{a hunter}} can stick their finger in an animal's scat to measure its temperature. If the scat <b>is</b> cold, <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> likely far and if the scat <b>is</b> warm, <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> likely close.|$|R
50|$|In {{the event}} of forfeiture, <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> shelter may {{determine}} whether <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> suitable for adoption and if adoption can <b>be</b> arranged for <b>the</b> <b>animal.</b> <b>The</b> <b>animal</b> may not <b>be</b> adopted by the defendant or by any person residing in the defendant's household. If <b>the</b> adopted <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> a dog used for fighting, <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> shelter shall notify any persons adopting the dog of the liability provisions for owners of dangerous dogs under Article 1A of Chapter 67 of the General Statutes. If no adoption can be arranged after the forfeiture, or <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> unsuitable for adoption, the shelter shall humanely euthanize <b>the</b> <b>animal.</b>|$|R
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} {{of the history of}} the animals before their {{installation}} in the 1917 carousel assembly. During the 1960s newspaper reports stated that it was believed that the animals had arrived in Indianapolis in 1917, imported from Germany by two brothers named Mangels, but later research revealed <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> manufactured by the Dentzel carousel company. Also included in the installation were oil paintings on the canopy over the animals and mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Opponents to the {{shut-down}} {{maintained that}} most of <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> unable {{to survive in the}} wild and would perish, and that the zoo's facilities had become one of the last possibilities for future generations of Navajos to see the sacred creatures and thereby relate to traditional stories, {{due to the fact that}} most younger Navajos are more accustomed to dealing with domesticated livestock rather than untamed animals.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} Malagasy {{hippopotamus}} (also known as Malagasy dwarf hippopotamus or Malagasy pygmy hippopotamus or Madagascan instead of Malagasy) {{lived on the}} island of Madagascar but are now believed to be extinct. <b>The</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> very similar to the extant hippopotamus and pygmy hippopotamus. The fossil record suggests that at least one species of hippopotamus lived until about 1,000 years ago, and other evidence suggests that the species may have survived until much more recently. The taxonomy of these animals is not resolved and not widely studied. The various species are believed to have survived into the Holocene era.|$|E
50|$|On 20 February, the State Government denied {{allegations}} that a dolphin {{had been caught}} on a drum line. <b>The</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> covered by a tarpaulin, a management response that activists had not seen previously. The Government stated that <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> a tiger shark.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{technique}} that zooarchaeologists use is lab analysis. [...] This analysis can include comparing the skeletons found on site with already identified animal skeletons. [...] This not only helps {{to identify what}} <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is,</b> but also whether <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> domesticated or not.|$|R

5|$|Subsequently, {{during his}} first days in office, Bluehouse's successor, Kelsey A. Begaye, {{received}} more complaints and letters protesting the zoo's closure than concerning any other political issue. After temporarily reversing Bluehouse's decision, Begaye then summoned {{a meeting with the}} Navajo Nation's Hataałii Advisory Council to discuss the situation; the group, however, refused to consider the matter while <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> in hibernation and postponed any advice or decision until April of the following year. Options under consideration were releasing the animals into the wild, not accepting new animals and closing the zoo after the last one had died, or renaming the zoo to a term that would be considered more respectful to the animals.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> {{restored}} between 1975 and 1977 by Bill and Caroline Von Stein of Cincinnati, Ohio. The Von Steins {{were experienced}} with {{other types of}} museum conservation work, but had never restored carousel animals. Because of the animals' poor condition, no attempt was made to restore them to their original paintwork; instead, the restorers were allowed to use their judgment on color choices and other decorations. The museum's only requirements were that they use reasonably natural decorative schemes and no high-gloss paint.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} human interaction with hippos comes from butchery cut marks on hippo bones at Bouri Formation dated around 160,000 years ago. Later rock paintings and engravings showing hippos being hunted {{have been found}} in the mountains of the central Sahara dated 4,000–5,000 years ago near Djanet in the Tassili n'Ajjer Mountains. The ancient Egyptians recognised the hippo as a ferocious denizen of the Nile and representations on the tombs of nobles show that <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> hunted.|$|E
50|$|American Humane {{certifies}} farms after evaluating {{them on a}} five point criteria. The criteria {{demands that}} <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> free from hunger, discomfort, pain, and fear, and that <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> able to express normal behaviors. Farms that meet this criteria receive an American Humane Certified label.|$|R
40|$|Summary. Responses were {{recorded}} from isolated neurons {{in the visual}} cortex of rhesus monkeys while they performed an orientation match to sample task. In each trial <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> first cued with randomly selected orientation, and then presented with a sequence of gratings whose orientations <b>were</b> randomly selected. <b>The</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> required to release a switch when it saw a grating that matched the cued orientation. For some recordings <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> given a tactile cue by having it feel the orientation of a grooved plate {{that it could not}} see. In other experiments the cue orientation was presented visually on the screen in front of <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> and then removed before the sequence of gratings was presented. Using this task it was possible to determine if a neuron's response to a particular orientation was affected by {{whether or not it was}} the orientation for which <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> looking. Over half the neurons examined in V 4 (110 / 192) responded differently to the visual stimuli when <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> cued to look for different orientations. For some neurons responses to all stimuli <b>were</b> strong when <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> cued to look for a particular orientation, but weak when the same stimuli were presented in trials where <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> had <b>been</b> cued to look for another orientation. This type of sensitivity was found in neurons recorded while <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> given a tactile cue, and also in other neurons tested when a visual cue was used, suggesting that the activity was not of direct sensory origin. In support of this, neurons in V 4 were not strongly affected when <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> felt <b>the</b> grooved plate while not performing the orientation matching task. The prevalence of behavioral effects that was found using the orientation matchin...|$|R
50|$|A crush is a {{permanent}} fixture in slaughterhouses, because <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> carried on a conveyor restrainer under its belly, with its legs dangling in a slot on either side. Carried in this manner, <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> unable to move either forward or backward by its own volition.|$|R
5|$|The first {{evacuation}} of the 20th century occurred in 1915 when {{the horses were}} evacuated from Lipica due to World War I and placed at Laxenburg and Kladrub. Following the war, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was broken up, with Lipica becoming part of Italy. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> divided between several different studs in the new postwar nations of Austria, Italy, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia. The nation of Austria kept the stallions of the Spanish Riding School and some breeding stock. By 1920, the Austrian breeding stock was consolidated at Piber.|$|E
5|$|The {{trials that}} the Donner Party {{had so far}} endured {{resulted}} in splintered groups, each looking out for themselves and distrustful of the others. Grass was becoming scarce, and <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> steadily weakening. To relieve the load of the animals, everyone was expected to walk. Keseberg ejected Hardkoop from his wagon, telling the elderly man {{that he had to}} walk or die. A few days later, Hardkoop sat next to a stream, his feet so swollen that they split open, and he was not seen again. William Eddy pleaded with the others to find Hardkoop, but they all refused, swearing that they would waste no more resources on a man who was almost 70 years old.|$|E
5|$|Venison was {{the most}} popular game. The {{plentiful}} meat was often potted or jerked, and its tripe was popular as well. Venison was especially popular during the Thanksgiving season. Buffalo was an important protein source until roughly 1770, when <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> over-hunted in the eastern United States. Bear were numerous in the northern colonies, especially in New York, and many considered the leg meat to be a delicacy. Bear meat was frequently jerked as a preservation method.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A 6 -year-old, male {{southern}} chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica) had {{an absence}} of flight response and was captured by hand in the Catalan Pyrenees in northeast Spain. On clinical examination, <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> in good body condition, and only atrophy of the right eye was observed. Blood samples were collected and hematologic analysis performed, but no alterations <b>were</b> observed. <b>The</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> sent to a Wildlife Rescue Centre, where it developed chronic wasting and died after 32 days in captivity. At necropsy, <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> cachectic and had edematous, mottled lungs. Histopathologic examination revealed systemic toxoplasmosis and acute Gram-negative septicemia.
