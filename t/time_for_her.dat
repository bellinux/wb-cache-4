5|$|Competing at {{her first}} Summer Olympics, Aicha Fall {{qualified}} for the London Games as a wildcard, as she had set no <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> event, the 800 meters. She was {{to compete in the}} 2012 World Junior Championships in Athletics 800 meters but did not start the event. She competed on August 8 in Heat 5 against seven other athletes. She posted a time of 2 minutes and 27.97 seconds, finishing sixth and setting a national record in the process. She placed ahead of Palestine's Woroud Sawalha (2 minutes and 29.16 seconds) and behind Canada's Melissa Bishop (2 minutes and 09.33 seconds) in a heat led by Ukraine's Nataliia Lupu (2 minutes and 8.35 seconds). Overall, Fall was 24.12 seconds behind the slowest athlete that progressed to the semi-finals and therefore did not advance.|$|E
5|$|Reïna-Flor Okori, at age 36, was {{the only}} Equatoguinean female competitor. She had {{previously}} competed at the previous three Summer Games but with the French Olympic team. She was notable for being the flag bearer for the opening and closing ceremonies. Okori qualified for the Games via a wildcard because she had not recorded a qualifying standard <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> event, the women's 100 metres hurdles. She spent time training in Equatorial Guinea and France preparing for the Games. In an interview before the Games Okori said she aimed to reach {{the final stage of}} her event and earn Equatorial Guinea's first Olympic gold medal. She was due to compete in the contest's sixth heat on 16 August alongside seven other participants but was unable to start the event because of a ruptured popliteal cyst.|$|E
5|$|Though widely {{respected}} in her later years, Roosevelt was a controversial First Lady at the <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> outspokenness, particularly her stance on racial issues. She {{was the first}} presidential spouse to hold regular press conferences, write a daily newspaper column, write a monthly magazine column, host a weekly radio show, and speak at a national party convention. On a few occasions, she publicly disagreed with her husband's policies. She launched an experimental community at Arthurdale, West Virginia, {{for the families of}} unemployed miners, later widely regarded as a failure. She advocated for expanded roles for women in the workplace, the civil rights of African Americans and Asian Americans, and the rights of World War II refugees.|$|E

5|$|Competing at {{her first}} Summer Olympic Games, Pramila Rijal {{was the oldest}} person to compete for Nepal at the London Olympic Games {{at the age of}} 27. She {{attained}} qualification to the Games {{with the use of a}} wildcard because she had not set any previous <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> event, the 100 metres. Rijal revealed that she had problems with the starting block but hoped the training in Kent would aid her in setting a new Nepalese national record. She took part in the event's fourth heat on 3 August, finishing sixth out of nine competitors, with a time of 13.33 seconds. The result was attributed to Rajal having back pain in the days before the event and required painkillers to help her cope. She finished in front of Janice Alatoa of Vanuatu (13.60 seconds) and Mihter Wendolin from Micronesia (13.67 seconds) but behind Lidiane Lopes of Cape Verde (12.72 seconds) in a heat led by Papua New Guinea's Toea Wisil (11.60 seconds). Rajal finished 71st out of 78 runners overall, and was 1.11 seconds slower than the slowest competitor who advanced to the first round and did not make the later rounds.|$|E
5|$|In 1830, the Duchess of Kent and Conroy took Victoria {{across the}} centre of England to visit the Malvern Hills, {{stopping}} at towns and great country houses along the way. Similar journeys {{to other parts of}} England and Wales were taken in 1832, 1833, 1834 and 1835. To the King's annoyance, Victoria was enthusiastically welcomed in each of the stops. William compared the journeys to royal progresses and was concerned that they portrayed Victoria as his rival rather than his heir presumptive. Victoria disliked the trips; the constant round of public appearances made her tired and ill, and there was little <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to rest. She objected {{on the grounds of the}} King's disapproval, but her mother dismissed his complaints as motivated by jealousy, and forced Victoria to continue the tours. At Ramsgate in October 1835, Victoria contracted a severe fever, which Conroy initially dismissed as a childish pretence. While Victoria was ill, Conroy and the Duchess unsuccessfully badgered her to make Conroy her private secretary. As a teenager, Victoria resisted persistent attempts by her mother and Conroy to appoint him to her staff. Once queen, she banned him from her presence, but he remained in her mother's household.|$|E
5|$|Repairs to Vittorio Veneto were {{completed}} in <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to join Littorio on {{attacks on the}} convoys Vigorous and Harpoon, which had departed Alexandria and Gibraltar to reinforce Malta simultaneously in mid-June. Combat {{was limited to the}} opposing light forces, and Littorio and Vittorio Veneto did not see action; the British nevertheless broke off Operation Vigorous due to the ships' presence and heavy air attacks. While returning to port, Littorio was hit by a bomb from an American B-24 Liberator heavy bomber; the bomb struck the forward gun turret, though it did minimal damage. Before returning to port, a British Wellington bomber torpedoed the ship. The torpedo struck her starboard bow, though she returned to port. Repairs {{were completed}} and on 12 December, both ships were moved from Taranto to La Spezia in response to the Allied landings in North Africa. Roma joined the fleet shortly after the attacks on the two convoys, and joined her sisters for the move to La Spezia. There, she replaced Littorio as the fleet flagship.|$|E
