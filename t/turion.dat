25|$|Bladder traps are {{exclusive}} to the genus Utricularia, or bladderworts. The bladders (vesicula) pump ions {{out of their}} interiors. Water follows by osmosis, generating a partial vacuum inside the bladder. The bladder has a small opening, sealed by a hinged door. In aquatic species, the door has a pair of long trigger hairs. Aquatic invertebrates such as Daphnia touch these hairs and deform the door by lever action, releasing the vacuum. The invertebrate is sucked into the bladder, where it is digested. Many species of Utricularia (such as U. sandersonii) are terrestrial, growing in waterlogged soil, and their trapping mechanism is triggered {{in a slightly different}} manner. Bladderworts lack roots, but terrestrial species have anchoring stems that resemble roots. Temperate aquatic bladderworts generally die back to a resting <b>turion</b> during the winter months, and U. macrorhiza appears to regulate the number of bladders it bears in response to the prevailing nutrient content of its habitat.|$|E
2500|$|AMD {{has also}} {{introduced}} 64-bit processors into its embedded product line {{starting with the}} AMD Opteron processor. [...] Leveraging the high throughput enabled through HyperTransport and the Direct Connect Architecture these server class processors have been targeted at high-end telecom and storage applications.

2500|$|Red {{pondweed}} is {{a perennial}} herb anchoring {{in the mud}} substrate via a creeping rhizome. It produces a cylindrical unbranched stem, up to 2.8 m in [...] length. It has sessile lance-shaped submerged leaves that are typically 70–180mm long and 10–25mm wide with 4-7 lateral veins on either side and a slightly hooded apex, with an untoothed margin. Floating leaves may also be produced. The inflorescence is a spike of flowers a few centimeters long rising above the water surface. Turions are absent, but in winter each stem dies back to a resting bud with a short length of root, which acts as a functional <b>turion.</b>|$|E
50|$|Spirodela polyrhiza, {{living in}} pond, differs in their {{development}} from terrestrial plants in their morphology and physiology. They do mainly vegetative growth called fronds {{in spring and}} summer time, while they switch into a dormant phase represented by <b>turions</b> in autumn and winter due to nutrition starvation and freezing temperature. <b>Turions</b> could also be induced by plant hormone ABA in the lab. Researchers reported that <b>turions</b> were rich in anthocyanin pigmentation and had a density that submerged them {{to the bottom of}} liquid medium. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of <b>turions</b> showed in comparison to fronds shrunken vacuoles, smaller intercellular space, and abundant starch granules surrounded by thylakoid membranes. <b>Turions</b> accumulated more than 60% starch in dry mass after two weeks of ABA treatment.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Basic {{respiration}} {{characteristics were}} measured in <b>turions</b> of six aquatic plant species differing greatly in their ecological and overwintering characteristics {{both before and}} after overwintering, i. e., in dormant and non-dormant state: non-carnivorous Hydrocharis morsus-ranae and Caldesia parnassifolia and carnivorous Aldrovanda vesiculosa, Utricularia australis, U. ochroleuca, and U. bremii, and in non-dormant winter apices of three Australian (sub) tropical populations of Aldrovanda and of two temperate North American Utricularia species, U. purpurea and U. radiata. Respiration rate of autumnal (dormant) <b>turions</b> at 20 ◦C ranged from 0. 36 to 1. 3 µmol O 2 kg− 1 (FM) s− 1 and, except for U. bremii, increased by 11 – 114 % after overwintering. However, this increase was statistically significant only in two species. Respiration Q 10 in dormant <b>turions</b> ranged within 1. 8 – 2. 6 and within 2. 3 – 3. 4 in spring (non-dormant) <b>turions.</b> <b>Turions</b> of aquatic plants behave as typical storage, overwintering organs with low respiration rates. No relationship was found between respiration rate of <b>turions</b> and overwintering strategy. In spite of their low respiration rates, <b>turions</b> can usually survive only from one season to another, due to their limited reserves of respiratory substrates for long periods. Contrary to true <b>turions,</b> respiration rates in non-dormant winter apices both in Australian Aldrovanda populations and temperate U. radiata and U. purpurea, in sprouting <b>turions,</b> and growing shoot apices of Aldrovanda were high and ranged from 2. 1 to 3. 1 µmol kg− 1 (FM) s− 1, which is comparable to that in aquatic plant leaves or shoots.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{protein synthesis}} during germination of <b>turions</b> (dormant body), the <b>turions</b> were induced by nitrogen-limiting medium from the greater duckweed, Spirodela polyrrhiza. During germination of the <b>turions,</b> fresh weight and intracellular components such as amino acids, proteins, RNA, and DNA were estimated. Effects of several antimetabolites added at various germination stages on the germination and {{the incorporation of}} radioactive amino acid into proteins were estimated. These {{results indicate that the}} dormant <b>turions</b> should preserve long-lived messenger RNAs which are required for early protein synthesis because protein synthesis was not inhibited by cordycepin and 2 -thiouracil. Pulse labeling experiments with 35 S-methionine showed that the proteins synthesized after 48 h of the germination appeared to be dependent upon newly transcribed mRNAs, since protein bands in SDS-polyacryamide gel electropho· resis and autoradiogram were markedly different between before 24 h and after 48 h of the germination.

5000|$|Some {{aquatic plant}} species produce {{overwintering}} <b>turions,</b> {{especially in the}} genera Potamogeton, Myriophyllum, Aldrovanda and Utricularia. These plants produce <b>turions</b> in response to unfavourable conditions such as decreasing day-length or reducing temperature. They are derived from modified shoot apices and are often rich in starch and sugars enabling them to act as storage organs. Although they are hardy (frost resistant), {{it is probable that}} their principal adaptation is their ability to sink to the bottom of a pond or lake when the water freezes. Because water expands anomalously at lower temperatures, water at [...] is denser than colder water and stays at the bottom, and in this water <b>turions</b> over-winter before rising again in the spring. Some <b>turions</b> or aquatic plants also exhibit drought resistance allowing them to survive in temporary pools.|$|R
