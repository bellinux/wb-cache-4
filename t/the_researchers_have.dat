5|$|The {{earliest}} {{remains of}} a syrinx, which has enough mineral content for fossilization, {{was found in a}} specimen of the duck-like Vegavis iaai dated 69-66 million year ago, and this organ is unlikely to have existed in non-avian dinosaurs. However, in contrast to Senter, <b>the</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> suggested that dinosaurs could vocalize and that the syrinx-based vocal system of birds evolved from a larynx-based one, rather than the two systems evolving independently. A 2016 study suggests that dinosaurs produced closed mouth vocalizations like cooing, which occur in both crocodilians and birds as well as other reptiles. Such vocalizations evolved independently in extant archosaurs numerous times, following increases in body size. The crests of the Lambeosaurini and nasal chambers of ankylosaurids have been suggested to function in vocal resonance, though Senter states that the presence of resonance chambers in some dinosaurs is not necessarily evidence of vocalization as modern snakes have such chambers which intensify their hisses.|$|E

25|$|An almost {{inaccessible}} cave, dubbed Yoram Cave, {{located on}} the sheer southern cliff face 100 m below the plateau, {{has been found to}} contain numerous plant remains, of which 6,000-year-old barley seeds were in such good state of preservation that their genome could be sequenced. This {{is the first time that}} this succeeded with a Chalcolithic plant genome, which is also the oldest one sequenced so far. The result helped determine that the earliest domestication of barley, dated elsewhere in the Fertile Crescent to 10,000 years ago, happened further north up the Jordan Rift Valley, namely in the Upper Jordan Valley in northern Israel. The Yoram Cave seeds were found to be fairly different from the wild variety, proof for an already advanced process of domestication, but very similar to the types of barley still cultivated in the region - an indication for remarkable constancy. Considering the difficulty in reaching the cave, whose mouth opens some 4 m above the exposed access path, <b>the</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> speculated that it was a place of short-term refuge for Chalcolithic people fleeing an unknown catastrophe.|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, Susan Scott and Christopher Duncan, {{respectively}} a demographer and zoologist from Liverpool University, {{proposed the}} theory that the Black Death might have been caused by an Ebola-like virus, not a bacterium. Their rationale was that this plague spread much faster and the incubation period was much longer than other confirmed Y. pestis–caused plagues. A longer period of incubation will allow carriers of the infection to travel farther and infect more people than a shorter one. When the primary vector is humans, as opposed to birds, this is of great importance. Epidemiological studies suggest the disease was transferred between humans (which happens rarely with Yersinia pestis and very rarely for Bacillus anthracis), and some genes that determine immunity to Ebola-like viruses are much more widespread in Europe than {{in other parts of the}} world.

2500|$|Mechanical {{force can}} provide a source of energy used by a desired {{chemical}} reaction. To create such materials, mechanically sensitive chemical groups called mechanophores are built into the chemical structure of the polymer. In one set of experiments, researchers used spiropyran molecules to detect mechanical stress. The spiropyran (SP) mechanophore was covalently bonded into a stretchy barbell-shaped polymer called polymethyl acrylate (PMA) and a small, glasslike bead-shaped polymer called polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). SP transformed into a fluorescent merocyanine (MC) form in response to stress. [...] The orientation of the MC subspecies relative to the tensile force could be characterized based on the anisotropy of the fluorescence polarization. [...] Spiropyrans were normally colorless but turned vivid shades of red or purple when stressed. They also fluoresce. <b>The</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> also demonstrated that mechanical force can power a chemical response in the polymer, changing the covalent bonding. A next step in this research is to explore the potential to use mechanochemical reactions to activate chemical pathways in materials to respond to shock waves in positive ways, by altering or enhancing properties of the material.|$|E

Peter Fonagy and Mary Target have attempted to bring attachment theory and psychoanalysis into a closer relationship by way of such aspects of cognitive science as mentalization, the ability to estimate what the beliefs or intentions of another person may be. A [...] "natural experiment" [...] has permitted extensive study of attachment issues, as researchers have followed the thousands of Romanian orphans who were adopted into Western families {{after the end of}} Nicolae Ceauşescu's regime. The English and Romanian Adoptees Study Team, led by Michael Rutter, has followed some of the children into their teens, attempting to unravel the effects of poor attachment, adoption and new relationships, and the physical and medical problems associated with their early lives. Studies on the Romanian adoptees, whose initial conditions were shocking, have in fact yielded reason for optimism.

2500|$|Spirits dead wheel {{turned out}} to be a mixed blessing. As it was {{traveling}} in March 2007, pulling the dead wheel behind, the wheel scraped off the upper layer of the Martian soil, uncovering a patch of ground that scientists say shows evidence of a past environment that would have been perfect for microbial life. It is similar to areas on Earth where water or steam from hot springs came into contact with volcanic rocks. On Earth, these are locations that tend to teem with bacteria, said rover chief scientist Steve Squyres. [...] "We're really excited about this," [...] he told a meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU). The area is extremely rich in silica–the main ingredient of window glass. <b>The</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> now concluded that the bright material must have been produced in one of two ways. One: hot-spring deposits produced when water dissolved silica at one location and then carried it to another (i.e. a geyser). Two: acidic steam rising through cracks in rocks [...] stripped them of their mineral components, leaving silica behind. [...] "The important thing is that whether it is one hypothesis or the other, the implications for the former habitability of Mars are pretty much the same," [...] Squyres explained to BBC News. Hot water provides an environment in which microbes can thrive and the precipitation of that silica entombs and preserves them. Squyres added, [...] "You can go to hot springs and you can go to fumaroles and at either place on Earth it is teeming with life – microbial life." ...|$|E
2500|$|All {{experiments}} {{are carried out}} at 60°C. Changes in the equilibrium constant (K) are used to determine what type of lipid interactions are occurring within the modeled membrane as well as observe liquid-ordered versus liquid-disorder regions. The value of the equilibrium constant determine the following: 1) if monomers are mixed ideally (K = 4.0) 2) when the monomers are mixed homogenously {{also referred to as}} an homo-association (K < 4.0) and 3) if the monomers have interchanged heterogeneously which is referred to as an hetero-association ( [...] K > 4.0) A plot of (K) is then created versus the cholesterol mol%. Each plot has similar trends in which the value of the equilibrium constant increased as the mol% increased with and without the presence of ethanol indicating a linear regression. Initially all the model membranes were organized in a liquid order phase but as the addition of cholesterol increase a liquid-disorder phase was observed. The following was determined regarding the liquid-order and liquid-disordered transitions during the addition of cholesterol in the presence of ethanol in each model membrane: 1) 0–15nbsp&mol% cholesterol a liquid-disordered phase was present 2) from 15 to 30nbsp&mol% there was a co-existence of both phases and 3) above 27 mole% of cholesterol the model membrane completed converted back to the original liquid-order phase within a two-hour time frame. The linear regression maxed out at 30nbsp&mol% of cholesterol. It's important to mention that ESR studies were also performed that show a coexistence of the liquid-order/liquid-disorder phase from 0 to 8 mole% and as well as 8–27nbsp&mol%. The model membrane containing DPPC, cholesterol, and exchanging lipids 1 and 2 show a drastic increase in the linear relationship between (K) versus the mol% of cholesterol. At approximately 8nbsp&mol% of cholesterol the start of the liquid-disordered phase begins. This same relationship is observed in the DSPC, cholesterol, and exchanging lipids 2 and 3 but the start of the liquid-disorder phase occurs at approximately 5.2 mole% with and without the presence of ethanol. Also, there is a higher equilibrium constant value in which the studies relate it to the stronger acyl chain interactions due to this region having longer carbon chains which results in a higher melting point as well. This study not only proves that in the presence of ethanol a reorganization or induced phase change takes place between the cholesterol-phospholipid interaction but that by using higher concentrations of sterol compounds like cholesterol it can hinder the effects of ethanol. The research also suggests that ethanol enhances the association between cholesterol-phospholipids within the liquid-ordered bilayers. The mechanism on how ethanol induces the liquid-disorder phase as well as enhances the cholesterol-phospholipid association is still not understood. <b>The</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> mentioned that part of the liquid-disorder formation occurs possibly be interrupting the hydrophobic region of the phospholipids, by binding closely towards the hydrophilic region of the phospholipid, and acting as [...] "filler" [...] since ethanol cannot closely align with the neighboring phospholipids. All of these possible mechanisms can be contributed to ethanol's amphiphilic nature.|$|E
