5|$|To {{the east}} von Falkenhayn, held his reserve force of 3rd Cavalry Division (Seventh Army's III Corps) and 19th Division (Eighth Army reserve) {{in front of}} Beit Jibrin. They waited {{throughout}} the day for the main attack to make progress before beginning their own advance, but the opportunity never eventuated. This powerful Ottoman counterattack had been contained and had not forced any rearrangement of the invading forces, whose preparations and concentration on the plain were now complete. But von Falkenhayn was forced to halt his Seventh Army's attack and then to <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> it the 16th Division plus one regiment.|$|E
5|$|There is {{reliance}} on repetition of themes within {{the plot of}} Thalaba. Three times he attained a paradise {{that turns out to}} be false, and this is followed by the death of a woman who are gone until the very end when Thalaba is awarded entrance into a true paradise. The seeking out of mythic figures to guide him onto the next part of the tale is equally repetitive and has little result for the plot. Various instances of the sorcerers and sorceresses are added to the story to emphasise the evil of magic along with tempting Thalaba with power. However, the emphasis on magic hides the moral within Thalaba's temptations. Although Thalaba does achieve his goal through moral submission, many of the quests and actions are arbitrary and repetitive. As such, they <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> any Islamic truth that could be found within the actions.|$|E
5|$|Levels in {{the console}} {{versions}} of Underground were significantly {{larger than those}} of earlier Tony Hawk's games. Neversoft expanded each level until it ceased to run correctly, then shrunk it slightly. Most of the levels were modelled closely after real-world locations; the designers traveled to locales representative of each city {{in the game and}} took photographs and videos as reference. The New Jersey level was a replication of a neighborhood where team artist Henry Ji had grown up as a young skater. Neversoft wanted the player to become familiar with the basic game mechanics quickly and to notice Undergrounds differences from previous Tony Hawk's titles immediately. To accomplish this, they introduced the ability to travel on foot, and the ability to climb along ledges in the first few missions of the game. While Neversoft wanted to keep Underground realistic and relatable for the most part, they added driving side-missions as an enjoyable diversion and to push the boundaries of freedom in skateboarding games. However, these missions were intended not to <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the main experience of skateboarding.|$|E

25|$|Wilberforce is {{the main}} villain of Gideon Defoe's novel The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists, where his {{opposition}} to Darwin is based in his part-ownership of a circus freakshow. He feels that Darwin's discovery (depicted in this book as teaching a chimpanzee to talk using note cards) will <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> his attraction's popularity, which he uses to kidnap young women {{and turn them into}} soap, hence his nickname.|$|E
25|$|Cho {{ended the}} year with two titles just like last. He {{went on to the}} Honinbo title, then lost the Tengen against the same person that he took the Honinbo from Rin Kaiho. Cho was happy to win the Honinbo once more, but Kobayashi still held to Kisei and Meijin titles, which Cho desired to <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> his rival. His record for this year was 29 wins and 18 losses.|$|E
25|$|In Game 1, the Cardinals' ace Bob Gibson threw a shutout, {{striking}} out 17 batters, as St. Louis won 4–0. As of 2011, Gibson's 17 strikeouts {{is still the}} record in a World Series game.

25|$|Non-food crops like Camelina, Jatropha, {{seashore}} mallow and mustard, {{used for}} biodiesel, can thrive on {{marginal agricultural land}} where many trees and crops won't grow, or would produce only slow growth yields. Camelina is virtually 100 percent efficient. It can be harvested and crushed for oil and the remaining parts {{can be used to}} produce high quality omega-3 rich animal feed, fiberboard, and glycerin. Camelina does not <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> land currently being utilized for food production. Most camelina acres are grown in areas that were previously not utilized for farming. For example, areas that receive limited rainfall that can not sustain corn or soybeans without the addition of irrigation can grow camelina and add to their profitability.|$|E
25|$|Oldcastle's {{religious}} beliefs were considerably influenced by Lollard cleric William Swynderby, who preached in Almeley during his youth. Lollardy was a politico-religious movement initiated by prominent theologian John Wycliffe in the 1370s during his {{service in the}} University of Oxford. Lollard beliefs were outlined in the 1395 The Twelve Conclusions of the Lollards, which dealt with their opposition to capital punishment, rejection of religious celibacy, and belief {{that members of the}} Clergy should be held accountable to civil laws. The Conclusions also rejected pilgrimages, ornamentation of churches, and religious images because these were said to <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the true nature of worship, focus on God. Also denounced in the Conclusions were war, violence, and abortion.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of AD 17, Germanicus returned to the capital and on May 26 he celebrated a triumph for his victories over the Germans. He had captured a few important prisoners, but Arminius was still at large. It was far from clear that Germanicus had won the war. Nonetheless, this did not <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the spectacle of his triumph: a near contemporary calendar marks 26 May as the day in [...] "which Germanicus Caesar was born into the city in triumph", while coins issued under his son Gaius (Caligula) depicted him on a triumphal chariot, with the reverse reading [...] "Standards Recovered.

And I just had such a great experience that I wanted to take something from that experience. The number 18, in Judaism, it means 'chai'... and it's the symbol for life and good fortune in Judaism. And I thought that was something to <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Israel and let them know I'm still representing them." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews. Ahsan Haque of IGN {{rated the}} episode a 10/10, saying [...] "Overall, this episode easily ranks {{as one of}} the best episodes in the series. Almost every joke succeeds, and the far-fetched alternate reality storyline thoroughly entertains. Despite the fact that all of the events in the episode are revealed to be a dream, it doesn't <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the high degree of amusement provided." [...] Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number sixteen on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and described it as [...] "classic bonkers Family Guy". He added that the episode was [...] "potentially the first time fans realised this wasn't just a Simpsons ripoff." ...|$|E

To close her analysis, she said: [...] "The best lesson that one can <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> reading this book: that even the most terrible person can have a change of heart and make their own choices to do what is right." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{total of}} 10–11 UN peacekeepers were {{killed during the}} {{operation}} while 77 were wounded. This relatively low casualty rate greatly relieved Thant and his advisers. Total statistics on Katangese Gendarmerie and mercenary casualties are unknown. A total of seven UN fighter aircraft and a single reconnaissance aircraft were damaged by fire from the ground. In return, the Katangese Air Force had lost almost a dozen of its Harvards, Magisters, and de Havilland Vampires, most while on the ground. All Katangese combat aircraft, except {{for one or two}} Harvards, were recorded as destroyed by UN forces at the conclusion of Grandslam. General Christian Roy Kaldager, commander of the ONUC Air Force, later said of the Grandslam air campaign, [...] "We are very proud of it—it is the best memory I <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Congo." ...|$|E
500|$|Spencer McIlvaine at Nintendo Life was {{disappointed}} {{in how the}} Wii version only had a single use for motion controls, and how low-resolution graphics from handheld versions of the game were used. Dan Whitehead at Eurogamer similarly thought that the motion controls were only a minor addition, and {{was disappointed}} in how little effort Capcom had put into the port compared to LucasArts' remake of The Secret of Monkey Island. Craig Harris at IGN called it [...] "incredibly lazy", wishing that it had included improved art and sharper text. Cara Ellison at Eurogamer called the Trilogy HD port [...] "perfunctory", saying that animations are slow at times, that the high-definition graphics <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the charm of the pixel art in previous versions, {{and that there is}} a delay after button presses.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the failure}} of two of her {{commercial}} releases, Zinta began working with art film directors, and turned towards neo-realistic films, known in India as Parallel Cinema. She acted in her first English film, Rituparno Ghosh's The Last Lear, as a struggling film actress opposite Amitabh Bachchan. The film premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival, and was received well. Later reviews in India were approving, with Rajeev Masand writing, [...] "Preity Zinta gets through her scenes competently, never allowing her cute-as-a-button image to <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the impact she makes here as a conflicted, mature woman." [...] Initially dismissive of art films, Zinta eventually spoke of her first venture into the genre, confessing, [...] "I did think with art films that they don't pay you, they don't feed you, but I was wrong, and I'm {{so happy to be}} here." ...|$|E
500|$|On the {{direction}} of the film, Selick reflected, [...] "It's as though he [...] laid the egg, and I sat on it and hatched it. He wasn't involved in a hands-on way, but his hand is in it. It was my job {{to make it look like}} 'a Tim Burton film', which is not so different from my own films." [...] When asked on Burton's involvement, Selick claimed, [...] "I don't want to <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Tim, but he was not in San Francisco when we made it. He came up five times over two years, and spent no more than eight or ten days in total." [...] Walt Disney Feature Animation contributed with some use of second-layering traditional animation. Burton found production somewhat difficult because he was directing Batman Returns and in pre-production of Ed Wood.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{were mixed}} in their {{opinions}} on the gameplay; Roper said that [...] "simply see what's next" [...] was enjoyable, but acknowledged that the game's activities were limited beyond this aspect. Leadbetter went further, saying that Flow [...] "feels like a tech demo in many ways", and that its small amount of gameplay existed primarily [...] "to act as a tour guide" [...] through the visuals and audio. Freeman said that [...] "it would not be unfair to describe Flow as empty and without substance." [...] Navarro concluded that Flow was enjoyable for the few hours needed to complete it, but that it lacked [...] "a lasting gameplay experience"; he attributed this to the game's [...] "heavy emphasis on aesthetics over gameplay".
