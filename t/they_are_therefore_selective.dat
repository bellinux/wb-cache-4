40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{properties}} of 3 -methyl isoquinoline, 3, 4 -dihydropapaverine, tetrahydropapaverine and tetrahydropapaveroline were {{compared with those of}} papaverine and laudanosine. The work includes functional studies on rat isolated aorta contracted with noradrenaline, caffeine or KC 1, and a determination of the affinity of the compounds for α 1 -adrenoceptors and calcium channel binding sites, with [#H]-prazosin, [#H]-nitrendipine and [#H]-(+) -cis-diltiazem binding to rat cerebral cortical membranes. The effects of papaverine derivatives on the different molecular forms of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDE) isolated from bovine aorta were also determined. The three papaverine derivatives show greater affinity than papaverine for the [#H]-prazosin binding site. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> more <b>selective</b> as inhibitors of [#H]-prazosin binding as opposed to [#H]-(+) -cis-diltiazem, while papaverine appears to have approximately equal affinity for both. [#H]-nitrendipine binding was not affected by either papaverine or papaverine derivatives in concentrations up to 100 [*]μM. 3 -Methylisoquinoline had no effect on any of the binding sites assayed. Contractions evoked by noradrenaline (1 [*]μM) in rat aorta were inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by 3, 4 -dihydropapaverine, tetrahydropapaverine and with a lower potency, by tetrahydropapaveroline. In Ca 2 +-free solution, tetrahydropapaverine and to a lesser extent, tetrahydropapaveroline, inhibited the noradrenaline (1 [*]μM) evoked contraction in a concentration-dependent manner and did not modify the phasic contractile response evoked by caffeine (10 [*]mM). This suggests that these alkaloids do not act at the intracellular level, unlike papaverine which inhibits the contractile response to caffeine and noradrenaline. Inositol phosphates formation induced by noradrenaline (1 [*]μM) in rat aorta was inhibited by tetrahydropapaverine (100 [*]μM) and tetrahydropapaveroline (300 [*]μM), thus suggesting that α 1 D-adrenoceptors are coupled to phosphoinositide metabolism in rat aorta. Unlike papaverine, which has a significant effect on all the PDE isoforms, the three alkaloids assayed did not have an inhibitory effect on the different forms of PDE isolated from bovine aorta. These results provide evidence that papaverine derivatives with a partially or totally reduced isoquinoline ring have a greater affinity for α 1 -adrenoceptors and a lower affinity for benzothiazepine sites in the Ca 2 +-channel than papaverine. This structural feature also implies a loss of the inhibitory activity on PDE isoforms. The planarity of the isoquinoline ring (papaverine) impairs the interaction with the α 1 -adrenoceptor site and facilitates it with the Ca 2 +-channels and PDEs, whereas the more flexible tetrahydroisoquinoline ring increases the binding to α 1 -adrenoceptors...|$|R
