The derivation method of weight formulae of wing, which takes account the wing off-loading more exactly has been suggested, the mathematical model <b>of</b> <b>aeroplane</b> with two-fuselage scheme, which includes the derived weight formula of wing has been suggested, the optimum properties <b>of</b> <b>aeroplane</b> with two-fuselage scheme have been obtained. The obtained weight formula may be used at the design <b>of</b> <b>aeroplane</b> mass <b>of</b> non-traditional scheme number, the data about the optimum properties <b>of</b> <b>aeroplanes</b> with two-fuselage scheme may be used at the scheme choice.
