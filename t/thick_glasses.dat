5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous proponent of the Bates method was the British writer Aldous Huxley. At the age of sixteen Huxley had an attack of keratitis, which, after an 18-month period of near-blindness, left him with one eye just capable of light {{perception}} {{and the other with}} an unaided Snellen fraction of 10/200. This was mainly due to opacities in both corneas, complicated by hyperopia and astigmatism. He was able to read only if he wore <b>thick</b> <b>glasses</b> and dilated his better pupil with atropine, to allow that eye to see around an opacity {{in the center of the}} cornea.|$|E

He is a nerd—he has a significant overbite, wears <b>thick</b> <b>glasses,</b> is very eager and sensitive. He is often appalled by the behaviour of the other lodge members (and even Red himself), and he {{puts a lot of}} effort into trying to change everyone's behaviour, usually with little or no success.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{having to}} wear <b>thick</b> <b>glasses</b> to {{compensate}} for his myopia, {{he had a long}} career as a batsman in university, club and first-class cricket. He played five first-class matches as a middle-order batsman for Bihar between 1951 and 1960. He made his highest score, 33, in his first innings in 1951–52. Returning to the side for Bihar's last Ranji Trophy game in 1958–59, he made the equal top score for the match, 17 not out, in the second innings in a match in Patna in which only 188 runs were scored for the loss of 32 wickets. After being dismissed for 49 in their first innings, Bihar needed 45 to beat Orissa and were 19 for 2 when Mukherjee came to the wicket and shared an unbroken partnership of 27, the highest partnership of the match, to take Bihar to victory.|$|E

40|$|The glass {{cooling rate}} during forming process has {{significant}} effect on the crystallization behavior and structural uniformity of Li 2 O―Al 2 O 3 ―SiO 2 (LAS) glass―ceramics. Finite element analysis indicated that the cooling rate of 10 mm <b>thick</b> <b>glass</b> was notably lower than that of 2 mm <b>thick</b> <b>glass.</b> The central temperature of LAS glass was still above 700 ¡䟥ven after the sample was cooled for 15 s, which {{led to the formation of}} crystal stones in the parent glass. The microstructure of LAS glass and glass―ceramics with different thickness were analyzed using DTA, IR and SEM. Since the 8 mm <b>thick</b> <b>glass</b> cooled slowly, primary crystal nuclei were generated in the glass interior. After heat treatment, a&beta;―spodumene phase was formed in the interior, while a&beta;―quartz solid solution phase formed on the surface. On the contrary, primary crystal nuclei were not generated in the 3 mm <b>thick</b> <b>glass</b> due to its high cooling rate. A single and uniform&beta;―quartz solid solution phase was found after heat treatment. Therefore, the high glass cooling rate and the temperature uniformity of glass are very important for the preparation of structurally uniform LAS glass―ceramics...|$|R
25|$|As a child, Berdella was intelligent, but {{a classic}} loner who rarely played outside his own home, and seldom had friends visit his home to socialize with him. He was also {{severely}} nearsighted (resulting in his {{being required to}} wear <b>thick</b> <b>glasses</b> {{from the age of}} five) and afflicted with a slight speech impediment. Furthermore, as a child, he would be diagnosed as suffering from a high blood pressure, for which he was prescribed several medications. In part because of this diagnosis, Berdella was largely unathletic, whereas his younger brother, Daniel (b. 1956), displayed an aptitude for various sports from an early age. As Berdella's father valued sports and physical education, he viewed his older son's lack of interest in sports as a sign of failure on Berdella's part, and would often compare him unfavorably with his younger brother. Occasionally, Berdella's father would also become physically and emotionally abusive against his children, and is known to have beaten them with a leather strap.|$|E

Instead, it's a goofy-looking guy named Ned Flanders on the animated sitcom known as The Simpsons. The mustache, <b>thick</b> <b>glasses,</b> green sweater, and irrepressibly cheerful demeanor of Ned Flanders, Homer Simpson's next-door neighbor, have made him an indelible figure, the evangelical known most intimately to nonevangelicals." ...|$|E

In 1938, Mikan attended the Chicago Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary and originally wanted to be a priest, but then moved back home to finish at Joliet Catholic. Mikan did not seem destined to become an athlete.

500|$|Glee costume {{designer}} Lou Eyrich described Rachel's costuming {{in an interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Originally, the inspiration for her look was Tracy Flick from Election—very buttoned-down, preppy, obnoxious, squeaky clean, nerdy. But she's got at least 12 costume changes each episode. That same look all the time just gets boring for the screen and for the actress to wear, so we spread it out a lot. We try to have her buttoned-up or wearing a nerdy sweater over a cute dress, like she doesn't quite get it right. Or she takes that sweater and tucks it into the skirt and pairs it with knee highs and flats. She makes it her way, which is more quirky. The popular girls {{find a way to make}} it look cool, but Rachel makes it look nerdy. But it's not old-school nerdy with <b>thick</b> <b>glasses</b> and pocket protectors. She thinks she's taking a trend and making it cool, but she wears it wrong." ...|$|E

Dr. Hibbert tells Comic Book Guy that he needs to take a break from running the store and to leave it in the care of friends. Since he actually doesn't have any friends, Comic Book Guy reluctantly leaves the store in Bart and Milhouse's care.

He has an IQ of 197it was 199 before he sustained a concussion during the collapse of Springfield's brief intellectual juntaand {{is a member of}} the Springfield chapter of Mensa.

[...] and [...] "FLAVIN" [...] and impulsively shouting other words that have no relevance to the situation at hand. He also occasionally refers to the importance of remembering to [...] "carry the one" [...] in various mathematical calculations. When he rambles he often speaks incoherently in run-on sentences without pauses. Frink also has a tendency to over-complicate simple matters and/or invent scientific terminology while expressing various concepts, e.g. [...] "Father and I got along like positrons and antineutrinos!" [...] or, [...] "microcalifragilistics".|$|E

Disney's Michael Eisner explains, [...] "Estelle Getty made our three women into girls. And that was, to me, what made it seem like {{it could be a}} contemporary, young show." [...] As surprising as it may sound, Estelle Getty continuously battled her stage fright. During an interview in 1988, Getty commented on her phobia and expressed how working with major stars, such as Arthur and White, made her even more nervous. At times, she even froze on camera while filming.|$|E

Over time, and with advances in medical technology, her eyesight did improve such that with <b>thick</b> <b>glasses,</b> she could attend school and even ride a bicycle. However, before that happened, her mother, the Princess, clinging to any thread that offered some hope for a cure, came under the strong influence of Greet Hofmans, a faith healer with heterodox beliefs, who was considered by [...] "her many detractors" [...] to be a sham.|$|E

Jan Wong wrote extensively about the whole experience in her book Out of the Blue, A Memoir of Workplace Depression, Recovery, Redemption and Yes, Happiness. In it, Jan Wong described in detail the backlash she received immediately after her article published, how the Globe and Mail management, in her view, abandoned her in front of the torrent of negative reactions from all sides, and how she spiraled down into depression. [...] She described when she found the ‘exact moment I began my descent into depression’ when she was shattered by racial attack.
