5|$|As {{with most}} breeds of dog, the Russian Toy can suffer from patellar luxation, {{which is where}} the knee cap slips out of place when the knee bends as <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> that {{normally}} holds it in place is too shallow. It is usually an inherited defect, which occurs during the development of the foetus and rarely by trauma.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} easily {{distinguishable}} from other Chinese hares, having longer ears than the South Chinese Hare. Like the Woolly hare (Lepus oiostolus) and the South Chinese hare, {{an examination of}} the skull shows <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> on the front face of the upper incisors is filled with cement.|$|E
5000|$|Researchers {{suggest that}} <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> are [...] "stretch marks" [...] caused by tidal forces. This idea {{is based on}} the model that Phobos is a rubble pile {{surrounded}} by a 100 m layer of powdery regolith. Stress fractures calculated for this model line up with <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> on Phobos. <b>The</b> model is supported with the discovery that some of <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> are younger than others, implying that the process that produces <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> is ongoing.|$|R
40|$|The age, surface density, and {{association}} with the 10 -km crater Stickney of <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> (long linear depression) on Phobos are investigated, and the results support the cratering hypothesis of groove formation and seem to rule out a tidal mechanism. The appearance of <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> is described. <b>The</b> age of <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> is estimated from the density of superimposed impact craters; the density of impact craters within <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> is compared with the average value for all of Phobos. The old age of <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> {{as well as their}} evident {{association with}} the crater Stickney are considered to be inconsistent with the tidal hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|We have {{obtained}} optical second harmonic (SH) intensity {{images of a}} silver grating surface.

We have found that the strongest SH radiation comes from the bottoms of <b>the</b> <b>grooves.</b> On <b>the</b> other hand, the strong linear reflection comes from the slope of <b>the</b> <b>grooves.</b> We suggest that the enhancement of the electric field at the bottoms of <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> has led to the observed strong SH radiation...|$|R
5|$|Patellar luxation, {{also known}} as luxating patella, is a {{hereditary}} disorder affecting the knees. It is where the kneecap slips off <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> on which it normally sits. The effects can be temporary with the dog running while holding its hind leg in the air before running on it again once the kneecap slipped back into place as if nothing has happened. Dogs can {{have a problem with}} both rear knees, and complications can include arthritis or torn knee ligaments. Severe cases can require surgery.|$|E
5|$|Sea anemones {{have what}} can be {{described}} as an incomplete gut; the gastrovascular cavity functions as a stomach and possesses a single opening to the outside, which operates as both a mouth and anus. Waste and undigested matter is excreted through this opening. The mouth is typically slit-like in shape, and bears a groove at one or both ends. <b>The</b> <b>groove,</b> termed a siphonophore, is ciliated, and helps to move food particles inwards and circulate water through the gastrovascular cavity.|$|E
5|$|The Miracles {{recorded}} the song first and included their version on their 1968 album, Special Occasion. The Marvin Gaye version {{was placed on}} his 1968 album In <b>the</b> <b>Groove,</b> where it gained the attention of radio disc jockeys, and Motown founder Berry Gordy finally agreed to its release as a single in October 1968, when {{it went to the}} top of the Billboard Pop Singles chart for seven weeks from December 1968 to January 1969 and became for a time the biggest hit single on the Motown label (Tamla).|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> rebated <b>grooves</b> where <b>the</b> wedge was {{inserted}} were either 'L' shaped, rarely like a 'Y' with one branch missing or even 'U' shaped. Usually <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> faced <b>the</b> same direction although some examples (see photograph) have <b>the</b> centre <b>groove</b> facing <b>the</b> other direction {{that were used}} between fields so that the centre spar would resist being dislodged from the other side. <b>The</b> <b>grooves</b> were cut quite deeply to reduce the chance of the spar becoming dislodged. <b>The</b> <b>grooves</b> were sometimes neatly cut with the skill of a stonemason or rather roughly formed by farm workers, etc.|$|R

5|$|For {{owners of}} 33rpm LPs and 45singles, loud and deep bass was {{limited by the}} ability of the {{phonograph}} record stylus to track <b>the</b> <b>groove.</b> Some hi-fi aficionados solved the problem by using reel-to-reel tape players which were capable of delivering accurate, naturally deep bass from acoustic sources, or synthetic bass not found in nature. With the popular introduction of the compact cassette and the CD, it became possible to add more low frequency content to recordings, and satisfy a larger number of consumers. Home subwoofers grew in popularity, as they were easy to add to existing multimedia speaker setups and they were easy to position or hide.|$|E
5|$|Marvin Gaye's {{version was}} {{recorded}} in spring 1967, and is the second known recording, though was also rejected by Gordy as a single, and would also later go onto an album, In <b>the</b> <b>Groove.</b> The third recording was in 1967 with Gladys Knight and the Pips in a new, faster arrangement. Gordy accepted the new arrangement and the Gladys Knight version was released as a single in September 1967, reaching number 2 in the charts. When Gaye's album with his version of Grapevine was released in August 1968, radio disc jockeys were playing the song, so Gordy had it released as a single in October, and it went to number one in December.|$|E
5|$|Relatively new {{cells in}} a groove {{on the edges}} of the mantle secrete {{material}} that extends the periostracum. These cells are gradually displaced to the underside of the mantle by more recent cells in <b>the</b> <b>groove,</b> and switch to secreting the mineralized material of the shell valves. In other words, {{on the edge of the}} valve the periostracum is extended first, and then reinforced by extension of the mineralized layers under the periostracum. In most species the edge of the mantle also bears movable bristles, often called chaetae or setae, that may help defend the animals and may act as sensors. In some brachiopods groups of chaetae help to channel the flow of water into and out of the mantle cavity.|$|E

50|$|The {{teeth of}} the {{variator}} pulley of an iCVT are formed by pins that extend from one pulley half to the other pulley half and slide in <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> of <b>the</b> pulley halves of the variator pulley. Here torque from the chain is transferred to the pins and then from the pins to the pulley halves. Since the pins are round and <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> are curved, line contact between the pins and <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> are used to transfer force from the pins to <b>the</b> <b>grooves.</b> <b>The</b> amount of force that can be transmitted between two parts depend on the contact area of the two parts. Since the contact areas between the pins and their grooves are very small, the amount of force that can be transmitted between them, and hence also the torque capacity of an iCVT, is limited.|$|R
5|$|Small lymphatic {{networks}} called plexuses exist beneath each of {{the three}} layers of the heart. These networks collect into a main left and a main right trunk, which travel up <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> between the ventricles that exists on the heart's surface, receiving smaller vessels as they travel up. These vessels then travel into the atrioventricular groove, and receive a third vessel which drains the section of the left ventricle sitting on the diaphragm. The left vessel joins with this third vessel, and travels along the pulmonary artery and left atrium, ending in the inferior tracheobronchial node. The right vessel travels along the right atrium and the part of the right ventricle sitting on the diaphragm. It usually then travels in front of the ascending aorta and then ends in a brachiocephalic node.|$|E
5|$|The {{shell is}} {{composed}} of two calcareous valves held together by a ligament. The valves are made of either calcite, {{as is the case}} in oysters, or both calcite and aragonite. Sometimes, the aragonite forms an inner, nacreous layer, {{as is the case in}} the order Pterioida. In other taxa, alternate layers of calcite and aragonite are laid down. The ligament and byssus, if calcified, are composed of aragonite. The outermost layer of the shell is the periostracum, a skin-like layer which {{is composed of}} a conchiolin. The periostracum is secreted in <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> between the outer and middle layers of the mantle, and is usually olive or brown in colour and easily abraded. The outer surface of the valves is often sculpted, with clams often having concentric striations, scallops having radial ribs and oysters a latticework of irregular markings.|$|E
5|$|The type {{specimen}} preserves the right canine. Like other therocephalians, the canine of Euchambersia was very large, {{resulting in a}} specialized predatory lifestyle that incorporates a sabertooth bite into prey killing. It is round in cross-section, and bears a prominent ridge {{on the side of}} its front surface. Immediately beside this ridge is a shallow depression that becomes wider {{near the top of the}} tooth, which is probably the same structure as <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> interpreted by some authors. Theriodonts usually replace their teeth in an alternating (or distichial) pattern, such that the canine tooth is always functional; both skulls of Euchambersia show no sign of any replacement teeth developing, suggesting that Euchambersia was reliant on having both canines present and functional simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|Since the Brunswick used a round {{that was}} {{specifically}} designed to be mated with <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> in <b>the</b> rifle, {{it had to be}} oriented properly in order to be loaded.

50|$|The area imaged by the {{microscope}} is 40 × 40 µm, {{small enough to}} fit on an eyelash. <b>The</b> <b>grooves</b> in this substrate are 14 µm in apart, from center to center. The vertical dimension is exaggerated in the image to make surface details more visible. <b>The</b> <b>grooves</b> are 300 nm in deep.|$|R
5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{was the use}} of a dummy head to {{find the}} location of an enemy sniper. The tempting target of a realistic papier-mâché head was raised above the parapet on a stick running in a groove on a fixed board. To increase the realism, a lit cigarette could be inserted into the dummy's mouth and be smoked by a soldier via a rubber tube. If the head was shot, it was dropped rapidly, simulating a casualty. The sniper's bullet would have made a hole in the front and back of the dummy's head. The head was then raised in <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> again, but lower than before by the vertical distance between the glasses of a trench periscope. If the lower glass of a periscope was placed before the front bullet hole, its upper glass would be at exactly the same height as the bullet had been. By looking through the rear hole in the head, through the front hole and up through the periscope, the soldier would be looking exactly along the line the bullet had taken, and so would be looking directly at the sniper, revealing his position.|$|E
5|$|For vertebrates, {{the early}} stages of neural {{development}} are similar across all species. As the embryo transforms from a round blob of cells into a wormlike structure, a narrow strip of ectoderm running along the midline of the back is induced to become the neural plate, the precursor of the nervous system. The neural plate folds inward to form the neural groove, and then the lips that line <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> merge to enclose the neural tube, a hollow cord of cells with a fluid-filled ventricle at the center. At the front end, the ventricles and cord swell to form three vesicles that are the precursors of the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. At the next stage, the forebrain splits into two vesicles called the telencephalon (which will contain the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures) and the diencephalon (which will contain the thalamus and hypothalamus). At about the same time, the hindbrain splits into the metencephalon (which will contain the cerebellum and pons) and the myelencephalon (which will contain the medulla oblongata). Each of these areas contains proliferative zones where neurons and glial cells are generated; the resulting cells then migrate, sometimes for long distances, to their final positions.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to deep fractures and grooved lanes, Enceladus has several {{other types of}} tectonic terrain. Many of these fractures are found in bands cutting across cratered terrain. These fractures probably propagate down {{only a few hundred}} meters into the crust. Many have probably been influenced during their formation by the weakened regolith produced by impact craters, often changing the strike of the propagating fracture. Another example of tectonic features on Enceladus are the linear grooves first found by Voyager 2 and seen at a much higher resolution by Cassini. These linear grooves can be seen cutting across other terrain types, like <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> and ridge belts. Like the deep rifts, they are among the youngest features on Enceladus. However, some linear grooves have been softened like the craters nearby, suggesting that they are older. Ridges have also been observed on Enceladus, though not nearly to the extent as those seen on Europa. These ridges are relatively limited in extent and are up to one kilometer tall. One-kilometer high domes have also been observed. Given the level of resurfacing found on Enceladus, it is clear that tectonic movement has been an important driver of geology for much of its history.|$|E
40|$|Families of lineaments in the Gilomesh and Ninki basins of Ganymede imply post impact tectonic activity. <b>The</b> <b>grooves,</b> {{previously}} considered <b>the</b> youngest tectonic features, {{are estimated}} to have formed between 3. 8 and 3. 1 Gyr ago. One rayed crater however, is probably less than 1 Gyr old, implying tectonic activity on Ganymede has extended nearly to the present. Like <b>the</b> <b>grooves,</b> <b>the</b> lineaments appear to be extensional. The parallel trends and nearly contiguous associations of the lineaments with <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> imply that both are products of the same stress systems. The young inferred age of the lineaments implies that they (and presumably also <b>the</b> <b>grooves)</b> are not associated with stresses in the cooling of fresh deposits of bright terrain, but are probably associated with underlying convective stress patterns, the long implied duration of an extensional stress regime in Ganymede's lithosphere {{is consistent with the}} stress models of derived assuming a differentiated interior...|$|R
5|$|Twin helical strands {{form the}} DNA backbone. Another double helix {{may be found}} tracing <b>the</b> spaces, or <b>grooves,</b> between <b>the</b> strands. These voids are {{adjacent}} to the base pairs and may provide a binding site. As the strands are not symmetrically located with respect to each other, <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> are unequally sized. One <b>groove,</b> <b>the</b> major <b>groove,</b> is 22Å wide and the other, <b>the</b> minor <b>groove,</b> is 12Å wide. The width of <b>the</b> major <b>groove</b> means that <b>the</b> edges of the bases are more accessible in <b>the</b> major <b>groove</b> than in <b>the</b> minor <b>groove.</b> As a result, proteins such as transcription factors that can bind to specific sequences in double-stranded DNA usually {{make contact with the}} sides of the bases exposed in <b>the</b> major <b>groove.</b> This situation varies in unusual conformations of DNA within the cell (see below), but the major and minor grooves are always named to reflect the differences in size that would be seen if the DNA is twisted back into the ordinary B form.|$|R
50|$|A {{complicated}} slipper {{bearing system}} {{was used in}} the Le Rhône engine. The master rod was of a split-type, which permitted assembly of the connecting rods. It also employed three concentric grooves, designed to accept slipper bearings from the other cylinders. The other connecting rods used inner-end bronze shoes, which were shaped to fit in <b>the</b> <b>grooves.</b> <b>The</b> master rod was numbered as number one and the shoes of numbers two, five and eight rode in <b>the</b> outer <b>groove,</b> <b>the</b> shoes of three, six and nine in <b>the</b> middle <b>groove</b> and four and seven in <b>the</b> inner <b>groove.</b> Although this system was complex, the Le Rhône engines worked very well.|$|R
5|$|Problems on the backstraight {{had been}} mostly {{rectified}} although a wet track {{surface in the}} first and fourth turns appeared caused by water coming from under the grandstands. Race officials deliberated {{on the morning of the}} race before declaring the track safe following the completion of repairs. The drivers took to the track at 11:15a.m local time for a ten-minute practice session. Carpentier set the fastest time with a lap of 27.075 seconds; Franchitti was second and Jimmy Vasser rounded out the session's top three drivers. A second session, lasting 90 minutes, began at 12:20p.m. local time. Kanaan recorded the session's fastest lap with a time of 24.719 seconds, ahead of Bräck in second and Tracy third. Three yellow caution flags were shown: the first was for Max Papis who cut his right-rear tyre, the second was for Maurício Gugelmin who slid out of <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> and hit the turn one outside barrier. His car slid across the wall and stopped at the corner's exit. The final stoppage was for a track inspection after Castroneves' pit crew reported the driver's right rear tyre was cut.|$|E
5|$|When the lophophore is extended, cilia (little hairs) on {{the sides}} of the tentacles draw water down between the tentacles and out at the base of the lophophore. Shorter cilia on the inner sides of the tentacles flick food {{particles}} into a groove in a circle under and just inside the tentacles, and cilia in <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> push the particles into the mouth. Phoronids direct their lophophores into the water current, and quickly reorient to maximize the food-catching area when currents change. Their diet includes algae, diatoms, flagellates, peridinians, small invertebrate larvae, and detritus. Unwanted material can be excluded by closing the epistome (lid above the mouth) or be rejected by the tentacles, whose cilia can switch into reverse. The gut uses cilia and muscles to move food towards the stomach and secretes enzymes that digest some of the food, but the stomach digests the majority of the food. Phoronids also absorb amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) through their skins, mainly in summer. Solid wastes are moved up the intestine and out through the anus, which is outside and slightly below the lophophore.|$|E

40|$|In this {{experimental}} work, it {{is shown}} that the geometric shape of <b>the</b> farming <b>grooves</b> could {{play an important role}} in sediment dynamics. From these results, it appears that, for slopes less than 40 %, <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> with a sinus shape export the least sediment mass. For steeper slopes, agricultural furrows in a circle lead to the minimum of sediment transport. The rheological behaviour of the solid discharge depends also strongly on the geometry of <b>the</b> <b>grooves...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this study, an {{experimental}} investigation on <b>the</b> effects of <b>grooves</b> on thrust washer bearings is investigated. Eight equally sized grooves are machined about 100 µm deep into {{one side of}} a flat-faced steel washer. This thrust washer bearing is lo-cated between a helical gear and its carrier and is tested on a test rig capable of measuring frictional torque and the temperature of the bearing at different speeds. It is found that <b>the</b> <b>grooved</b> washers had lower bearing temperatures and failed at signifi-cantly higher loads than the control washer with no grooves. For a test procedure with varying operating conditions, the co-efficient of friction is also significantly lower for <b>the</b> <b>grooved</b> washers. However, <b>the</b> <b>grooved</b> washers had about the same co-efficient of friction as the control washers at each step when the speeds are very high. The results from various tests sug-gest that the increased amount of lubricant passing through <b>the</b> <b>grooved</b> surface of <b>the</b> washer removes heat from the washer bearing by convection. This decrease in stored heat conducted from friction deters thermoelastic instabilities and the reduction of hydrodynamic stiffness due to the decrease in viscosity. En-hanced hydrodynamic load-carrying capacity is also evident in <b>the</b> <b>grooved</b> washers test results...|$|R
25|$|Cylinder phonographs {{generally}} used a {{worm gear}} to move the stylus in synchronization with <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> of <b>the</b> recording, whereas most disc machines relied on <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> to pull <b>the</b> stylus along. This resulted in cylinder records played {{a number of times}} having less degradation than discs, but this added mechanism made cylinder machines more expensive.|$|R
