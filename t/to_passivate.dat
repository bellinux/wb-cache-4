Fluorine piping is generally made of nickel or Monel (nickel-copper alloy). Care must be taken <b>to</b> <b>passivate</b> all surfaces frequently and to exclude any water or greases.

50|$|Pure {{aluminium}} naturally forms a thin {{surface layer}} of aluminium oxide on contact with {{oxygen in the}} atmosphere through a process called oxidation, which creates a physical barrier to corrosion or further oxidation in most environments. Aluminium alloys, however, offer little protection against corrosion. There are three main ways <b>to</b> <b>passivate</b> these alloys: alclading, chromate conversion coating and anodizing. Alclading {{is the process of}} metallurgically bonding a thin layer of pure aluminium to the aluminium alloy. Chromate conversion coating is a common way of passivating not only aluminum, but also zinc, cadmium, copper, silver, magnesium, and tin alloys. Anodizing forms a thick oxide coating. This finish is more robust than the other processes and also provides good electrical insulation, which the other two processes do not.|$|E

50|$|Tannic acid {{is used in}} the {{conservation}} of ferrous (iron based) metal objects <b>to</b> <b>passivate</b> and inhibit corrosion. Tannic acid reacts with the corrosion products to form a more stable compound, thus preventing further corrosion from taking place. After treatment the tannic acid residue is generally left on the object so that if moisture reaches the surface the tannic acid will be rehydrated and prevent or slow any corrosion. Tannic acid treatment for conservation is very effective and widely used but it does have a significant visual effect on the object, turning the corrosion products black and any exposed metal dark blue. It should also be used with care on objects with copper alloy components as the tannic acid can have a slight etching effect on these metals.|$|E
5000|$|Metal alloy anodes made of {{antimony}} (Sb), tin (Sn), phosphorus (P), germanium (Ge) {{and lead}} (Pb) have been studied.

50|$|Chromate {{conversion}} coating {{is a type}} of {{conversion coating}} used <b>to</b> <b>passivate</b> steel, aluminum, zinc, cadmium, copper, silver, magnesium, and tin alloys. It is primarily used as a corrosion inhibitor, primer, decorative finish, or to retain electrical conductivity. The process is named after the chromate found in chromic acid, also known as hexavalent chromium, the chemical most widely used in the immersion bath process whereby the coating is applied. However, hexavalent chromium is toxic, thus, highly regulated, so new, non-hexavalent chromium-based processes are becoming more readily available at a commercial level. One alternative contains trivalent chromium. In Europe the RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) Directive is commonly referred to regarding elimination of hexavalent chromium in electrical and electronic equipment, and the REACH ("Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals") Directive to wider applications including chromate conversion coating processes, paint primers and other preparations.|$|E
40|$|The anodic {{oxidation}} of sulphur dioxide dissolved either in distilled water or in acid solutions of copper sulphate has been studied, {{on account of}} the notable lowering of anodic polarization that this reaction can lead to in the extraction electrolysis of copper. The behaviour of different isolated electrodes in presence of SO 2 (passivated lead, graphite, stainless steel, cobalt-chrome-iron alloy UMCO 50, platinum) was studied, and the anodic polarization curves have been established by intensiodynamic, potentiodynamic and intensiostatic methods. The mechanism of {{anodic oxidation}} of sulphur dioxide on polished platinum was suggested by the existence of a transition time linked both to the depolarizer diffusion phenomena, and by the modification of the electrode surface at different polarizations. Contrary <b>to</b> <b>passivated</b> lead, stainless steel makes possible, like platinum, the oxidation of sulphur dioxide, the reaction being similarly inhibited at high polarizations.
