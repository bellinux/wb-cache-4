50|$|It {{had been}} the {{intention}} that the permanent pier railway would be worked by electric <b>traction,</b> <b>supplied</b> by overhead lines, but this was never implemented.

25|$|Conduit operation, {{in which}} trams took {{electricity}} from a conduit below {{and between the}} tracks, though very successful in locations such as town or city centres, proved to be very problematic on a line {{so close to the}} coast. During bad weather, sea water washed over the track and into the conduit where it short circuited the <b>traction</b> <b>supply</b> and operated the circuit breakers in the power station. Sand from the beaches was blown across the tracks and filled up the conduits. It was constantly necessary to remove this sand, as the addition of sea water would leave the conduits filled with wet sand which short circuited the supply. Another problem was that electrical resistance was greater than anticipated and the voltage in portions of the conduit was far less than that generated at Blundell Street – 230V dropped to 210V at the junction with the main line on the Promenade, 185V at Cocker Street and 168V at South Pier (then Victoria Pier).|$|E

30|$|Unlike the {{traditional}} <b>traction</b> power <b>supply</b> system which enables the electrified railway traction substation {{to be connected}} to power grid in a way of phase rotation, a new generation <b>traction</b> power <b>supply</b> system without phase splits is proposed in this paper. Three key techniques used in this system have been discussed. First, a combined co-phase <b>traction</b> power <b>supply</b> system is applied at traction substations for compensating negative sequence current and eliminating phase splits at exits of substations; design method and procedure for this system are presented. Second, a new bilateral <b>traction</b> power <b>supply</b> technology is proposed to eliminate the phase split at section post and reduce the influence of equalizing current on the power grid. Meanwhile, power factor should be adjusted to ensure a proper voltage level of the traction network. Third, a segmental power <b>supply</b> technology of <b>traction</b> network is used to divide the power supply arms into several segments, and the synchronous measurement and control technology is applied to diagnose faults and their locations quickly and accurately. Thus, the fault impact can be limited to a minimum degree. In addition, the economy and reliability of the new generation <b>traction</b> power <b>supply</b> system are analyzed.|$|R

50|$|The {{traction}} current has no direct earth point, {{but there are}} two resistors connected across the <b>traction</b> <b>supply.</b> The centre tap of the resistors is earthed, establishing the reference point between the positive and negative rails by voltage division. The resistors are large enough to prevent large currents flowing through the earthed infrastructure. The positive resistor is twice as large as the negative resistor, since the positive rail carries twice the voltage of the negative rail.|$|E
50|$|A key {{difference}} between the Class 56s and the earlier designs of the 1950s and 1960s {{is the use of}} self-exciting alternators rather than direct current (DC) generators for the generation of traction current and auxiliary supply. This produces a far more robust power unit, and greatly reduces the risk of flash-overs and other earth faults. <b>Traction</b> <b>supply</b> was rectified since the type employs DC traction motors. Many auxiliary machines (such as compressors and traction motor blowers) used the unrectified 3-phase AC output of the auxiliary alternator, and therefore run at a speed proportional to engine r.p.m.|$|E

50|$|The {{infrastructure}} of the London Underground includes 11 lines, with 270 stations. There {{are two types of}} line on the London Underground: services that run on the sub-surface network that is just below the surface and use larger trains, or the deep-tube lines, that are for the most part self-contained and use smaller trains. All of the lines emerge onto the surface outside the central area. The oldest train running on the Underground was introduced in 1972. The Underground is electrified using a four-rail system, the DC <b>traction</b> <b>supply</b> being independent of the running rails. Planned improvements include new stations, line extensions and more lines with automatic train operation (ATO).|$|E
50|$|Each {{motor car}} is fitted with two series DC motors, {{one on each}} of the two bogies and are {{designed}} to operate from the 630 volt <b>traction</b> <b>supply.</b> Each motor has an output of approximately 250 horsepower.

This system allows the master controller {{at one end of the}} train to simultaneously operate the switchgear on all the motor cars in a similar manner to the system developed by Sprague for the Elevated railway in Chicago, Illinois some 46 years earlier. This same supply is also used to power the train lighting as well as some other auxiliary circuits.|$|E

50|$|The London Underground O and P Stock {{electric}} {{multiple units}} were {{used on the}} London Underground from 1937 to 1981. O Stock trains were built for the Hammersmith & City line, using metadyne control equipment with regenerative braking, but the trains were made up entirely of motor cars and this caused technical problems with the <b>traction</b> <b>supply</b> so trailer cars were added. P Stock cars were built to run together with the O Stock cars now surplus on Metropolitan line Uxbridge services. The trains had air-operated sliding doors under control of the guard; the O Stock with controls in the cab whereas the P Stock controls in the trailing end of the motor cars. The P Stock was introduced with first class accommodation, but this was withdrawn in 1940.|$|E
50|$|The {{electrical}} system {{differs from the}} SNCF BB 36000 Astride locomotives: current collection is via one of two pantographs, one used for AC electrification supply, the other for DC supply. Under 25kV AC the supply voltage is stepped down by a transformer with four 1375 kW 1520V secondary windings for traction; the <b>traction</b> <b>supply</b> is actively rectified using a pulse chopper circuit. Under 3kV DC electrification the supply voltage is regulated by a chopper to 2200V, producing the same intermiediate DC supply voltage as when under 25kV AC electrification. The intermediate DC link powers four individual three phase GTO-based, heat pipe cooled inverters (one per traction motor); the traction motors are force cooled four pole, three phase asynchronous machines (4FXA4-559B) rated at 1280 kW. The {{electrical system}} allows regenerative braking, except under 1.5kV DC electrification, under which the locomotives operate at reduced power.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} use {{of these}} locomotives has been to haul trains using power from the rails until they reach the area where work is to be undertaken, where they switch to battery operation if the <b>traction</b> <b>supply</b> has been isolated. They are also used for transporting diesel powered equipment such as track tamping machines through tunnel sections. Normally one locomotive is marshalled {{at each end of}} the train, allowing the train to be reversed easily. The connections between different Underground lines often require reversals on route. Early locomotives were not allowed to operate on their own as they only had a single air compressor, but twin compressors were fitted to vehicles built from 1964 onwards, to allow single operation.With the building of the Jubilee line diesel-powered locomotives manufactured by Schöma of Germany in 1996 took over some of the duties of the battery locomotives.|$|E

40|$|As {{regenerative}} braking technology {{is widely used}} in urban rail transit system, there is an interest to find an optimization method for energy-saving train operation {{based on the information}} from <b>traction</b> power <b>supply.</b> To study such method, this paper introduces an integrated hardware-in-loop simulation platform, which has a model integrating train operation control and <b>traction</b> power <b>supply.</b> In this model, the train operation optimal control model provides train operation information for a <b>traction</b> power <b>supply</b> model, and the <b>traction</b> power <b>supply</b> model generates data of voltage and current based on the characteristics of <b>traction</b> power <b>supply,</b> which is needed by the train operation optimal strategy. Based on the model, an energy-saving optimal algorithm for train control is proposed. The algorithm adds third-rail voltage into inputs. When the third-rail voltage rises, the algorithm will judge whether nearby trains under control of the same substation meet the conditions to accelerate and will adjust train operation mode (accelerate) if possible to realize the maximum utilization of {{regenerative braking}} energy. In order to ensure schedule adherence, the proposed model adjusts running time in the next inter-station. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified on the integrated hardware-in-loop simulation platform based on field test of Yizhuang line, Beijing Subway. The result shows that the proposed algorithm has little effect on punctuality rate and it can save 7. 34 % on energy for traction at the most...|$|R
