5|$|Railway traffic {{throughout}} the state was paralyzed, as some train bridges collapsed, and extensive damage {{was found in the}} track ballast in multiple rail lines. Kansas City Southern Railway reported it expected a net loss of five cents per share on its annual earnings due to the stoppage affecting its Mexican subsidiary. The company later reported a drop of $33 million (2010 USD) in revenue due to hurricane damage. <b>The</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> railway infrastructure caused automotive part shortages throughout North America. General Motors was forced to cancel shifts at plants in Michigan, Missouri and Kansas. Ford also idled production in its Oakville, Ontario assembly plant, and suffered two-week delays in U.S. deliveries of its Fiesta model due to the rail track damage. <b>The</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> road system paralyzed a route used by 40% of the trade between the United States and Mexico, as 22,000 trucks were stalled after damage to the Nuevo LaredoMonterrey highway.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack on}} Truk was {{considered}} successful for the Allied force, with the ships and air units gaining useful experience while suffering two fatalities {{and the loss}} of seven aircraft to combat and accidents. <b>The</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Japanese facilities in the atoll, which had been repeatedly attacked during 1944 and 1945, was modest.|$|E

5|$|The embassy {{building}} was severely damaged by fire. It {{was more than}} a decade before the British and Iranian governments came to an agreement whereby the United Kingdom would repair <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> embassy in London and Iran would pay for repairs to the British embassy in Tehran, which had been damaged during the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Iranian diplomats began working from 16 Princes Gate again in December 1993.|$|E
5|$|Alexios's son John II Komnenos succeeded him in 1118 {{and ruled}} until 1143. John was a pious and {{dedicated}} Emperor who {{was determined to}} undo <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> empire suffered at the Battle of Manzikert, half a century earlier. Famed for his piety and his remarkably mild and just reign, John was an exceptional example of a moral ruler {{at a time when}} cruelty was the norm. For this reason, he has been called the Byzantine Marcus Aurelius.|$|E
5|$|Engineers Stimers and Newton {{soon began}} {{repairing}} <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pilot house and reconfigured the sides from an upright position to a slope of thirty degrees to deflect shot. During this time, Mrs. Worden personally brought news of her husband's progress and recovery and was optimistic, informing the crew his eyesight would soon return {{but he would}} be laid up for some time. She also informed them President Lincoln had personally paid Worden a visit extending his gratitude. However Worden was later taken to his summer home in New York and remained unconscious for three months. He returned to Naval service in 1862 as Commander of , another ironclad.|$|E

5|$|For 11days, the JTWC on Guam {{was unable}} to {{continue}} operations, relying on a backup agency. <b>The</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> airport radar prompted the NEXRADa network of high-resolution weather radarsto be installed earlier than scheduled, in February 1993, and limited incoming and outgoing flights to the daytime. On August30, a naval ship docked at Apra Harbor to provide a temporary mobile radar. By September15, both ships that had been washed ashore were refloated. In {{the aftermath of the}} destruction, insurance companies decided to stop issuing new policies for structures not made of concrete. In January 1996, former Governor Carl Gutierrez issued an executive order, mandating that homes or storm shutters on the island withstand winds of at least 250m/h (155mph).|$|E
5|$|In 1890 the Prison Commissioners {{agreed to}} declare Clifford's Tower a {{national}} monument and to conserve it as a historic location. In 1902 Clifford's Tower {{was given to}} the York Corporation, together with a grant of £3,000 (£242,000 at 2009 prices) arranged by Lord Wenlock for conservation and repairs. The removal of the talus and <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> castle stonework in the 16th century had put excessive pressure on the supporting motte, causing a recurrence of the 14th century subsidence. Sir Basil Mott, a leading Victorian engineer, installed concrete underpinnings to stabilise the structure beneath the gatehouse. By the early 20th century, Clifford's Tower was regularly open to visitors, and in 1915 it was passed to the Office of Works as a national monument.|$|E
5|$|In Bishop, {{intensity}} VI effects included {{broken windows}} and cracked walls in commercial and government buildings. Items fell from store shelves at grocery markets, streets were cracked, and wells had {{changes in the}} flow of water. <b>The</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mobile homes in Chalfant was also consistent with intensity VI shaking, with some of the homes moving laterally as much as 18 inches. Also in this classification was damage to pipe supports along a portion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct between the Upper, Middle, and Control Gorge Power Plants southeast of Crowley Lake. Intensity V (Moderate) effects (including cracked windows and broken underground pipes) were present in the Central Valley, Death Valley, and Carson City, Nevada.|$|E

5|$|In January 2014, Knut's full autopsy {{results were}} {{published}} by the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in the Journal of Comparative Pathology. It was the most in-depth post-mortem ever carried out on an animal. The autopsy revealed that <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bear’s brain was so severe {{that even if he}} had not fallen into the water and drowned he would have died anyway. Experts hypothesized that he was suffering from a virus that caused the encephalitis.|$|E
5|$|Kunivas' {{condition}} worsens, and Korris, Konmel, and Worf {{are present}} when he dies, {{and the three}} let out a fierce roar as per Klingon custom. As they return to the Klingons' quarters, Konmel is disappointed that Kunivas was not killed by an enemy, leading Worf to question {{the nature of the}} attack on the freighter; Korris and Konmel quickly change the subject. Worf forces Korris to reveal the truth: the three had commandeered the freighter, in order to seek out a place they could live as true Klingons, and <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> freighter was a result of a battle with a Klingon ship. When the two are seen near the ship's battle bridge, hoping to steal the drive section and escape the crew on the saucer, they are placed in the brig.|$|E

He made staff members job descriptions more flexible, encouraging staff members to take the initiative to perform a wide range of tasks. A corporate day care system was established, allowing staff to bring their children to work. Staff members were allowed to take off as much time as needed to reestablish themselves and corporate dress codes were relaxed. The company brought in counselors, insurance experts, tax consultants, child care advisers and construction companies to help the staff reorient themselves. The company also {{went so far as to}} arrange emergency loans for its employees.|$|E

5|$|On July 10—when {{the storm}} was {{approaching}} or at its peak intensity with winds of —the Bowditch encountered severe hurricane conditions which destroyed both of her masts and washed her entire crew overboard. Her captain was able to climb back aboard, where he survived for over a week with no food or water until he was rescued by a schooner. The Echo and Creole both sustained significant damage, and the crew and captain of the latter ship had to be rescued after she began taking on water. The extent of <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> three ships served {{as the basis for}} evaluating the storm's intensity in Partagás's paper. The hurricane ultimately passed between Bermuda and the United States before dissipating after July 12.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of , a fire {{broke out in the}} Old Building. It caused {{widespread}} damage to {{a large part of the}} structure, including the two oldest rooms in the school, School Room and Big School. The main concern was to prevent the books contained within the chained library from being damaged, either by fire or water from the fire brigade's hoses. <b>The</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> building was so great that rebuilding took over 2 years, with the unusually cold winter of 1962–1963 delaying the restoration. Lessons, however, continued throughout on the Allen House side of the high street.|$|E

5|$|Over 40% of French {{grape vines}} and {{vineyards}} were devastated over a 15-year period, {{from the late}} 1850s to the mid-1870s. The French economy was badly hit by the blight; many businesses were lost, and wages in the wine industry were cut to less than half. There was also a noticeable trend of migration to, among other places, Algiers and America. The production of cheap raisins and sugar wines caused problems for the domestic industry that threatened to persist even after the blight itself. <b>The</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> French economy, is estimated to have been slightly over 10billion Francs.|$|E
5|$|Syrian {{government}} forces supported by Russian airstrikes recaptured Palmyra on 27 March 2016 after intense fighting against ISIL fighters.

Following the recapture of the city, Russian de-mining teams began clearing mines planted by ISIL {{prior to their}} retreat. Following heavy fighting, ISIL reportedly reoccupied the city on 11 December 2016, prompting an offensive by the Syrian Army which retook the city on 2 March 2017.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> citadel, {{especially}} to its northern and western walls, was only repaired in 1407. In 1414, governor of Damascus Nawruz al-Hafizi, sought {{refuge in the}} citadel against the army of Sultan Al-Mu'ayyad Shaykh. The citadel was bombarded by trebuchet and cannon. The siege ended when a treaty of surrender was signed. In 1461, the southwest tower collapsed in a fire when missiles were fired from it to force the rebellious governor of Damascus to leave the city. This tower and four others were rebuilt in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, indicating that the repairs of 1407 had been carried out in haste.|$|E
