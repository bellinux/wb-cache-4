5|$|The growing {{consensus}} about the endothermy of dinosaurs (see dinosaur physiology) helps <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>their</b> full extinction {{in contrast with}} their close relatives, the crocodilians. Ectothermic ("cold-blooded") crocodiles have very limited needs for food (they can survive several months without eating) while endothermic ("warm-blooded") animals of similar size need much more food to sustain their faster metabolism. Thus, under the circumstances of food chain disruption previously mentioned, non-avian dinosaurs died, while some crocodiles survived. In this context, the survival of other endothermic animals, such as some birds and mammals, could be due, among other reasons, to their smaller needs for food, related to their small size at the extinction epoch.|$|E
5|$|Cathedral {{officials}} also described {{the use of}} guns in a city which has a gun crime problem as irresponsible. The Bishop of Manchester, the Right Reverend Nigel McCulloch, stated that it was well known that Manchester had a gun crime problem, {{and that it was}} beyond belief that a global manufacturer would re-create one of their Cathedrals with photo-realistic quality. Insomniac, the game's developer, declined to comment, referring all inquires to Sony Computer Entertainment Europe. Sony Computer Entertainment Europe issued a statement, stating that they were aware of the concerns expressed by the Bishop of Manchester and the Cathedral authorities, and take them seriously. However, they added that Resistance: Fall of Man is a fantasy science fiction game and not based on reality and that they believed they had sought and received all permissions necessary. Sony also stated that it would be contacting the Cathedral on 11 June 2007 <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>their</b> concerns in more detail. David Wilson, a Sony spokesman, told The Times that it was game-created footage, and not video or photography. Further, he compared it to science fiction shows such as Doctor Who, claiming that it was not based on reality at all.|$|E
5|$|The series {{revolves}} around the lives of Jaypaw, Lionpaw and Hollypaw, kits of Brambleclaw and Squirrelflight and grandchildren of the ThunderClan leader Firestar. The three slowly {{come to terms with}} their unique paths in life; Lionpaw worries about his thirst for blood on the battlefield, Hollypaw considers {{what it means to be}} truly loyal to her Clan, and Jaypaw is bitter that he was born blind. One day, Jaypaw unintentionally discovers a prophecy that he believes refers to him and his siblings. The three attempt <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>their</b> new destinies, and realize that Lionpaw has the power to never be harmed in battle, whilst Jaypaw can walk in the dreams and read the minds of other cats. Hollypaw, on the other hand, struggles to determine what her unique power is. Hollypaw and Lionpaw are made warriors, becoming Hollyleaf and Lionblaze respectively, whilst Jaypaw becomes a medicine cat and is later given the name Jayfeather. They seek the advice of a mysterious loner named Sol, who promises to give them the answers to their destinies; however, they eventually realize him to be a deceptive liar, and he is banished from the forest. Although uncertain of their powers, the three cats are always secure in the knowledge that they are deeply loved by their parents. This safe haven is shattered when they are forced into a fire by Ashfur, another ThunderClan warrior. Ashfur wishes to murder the three cats in order to punish their mother, Squirrelflight, for rejecting his love years earlier. However, Squirrelflight admits that the three cats are not her offspring, and Ashfur lets them go. The siblings are deeply distressed by this confession, and attempt to discover who their true parents are. They eventually learn that their mother is Leafpool, the ThunderClan medicine cat, and their father is Crowfeather, a WindClan warrior. Hollyleaf is devastated by this, and murders Ashfur in revenge. Unsatisfied, she then publicly announces to the rest of the Clans the true story of her heritage. When the Clans do not praise her for her honesty, but rather react with shock and confusion, Hollyleaf runs away into a series of collapsing tunnels. Presuming her to be dead, and numb with grief for their sister, Lionblaze and Jayfeather realize that Hollyleaf never had a power in the first place. They instead turn their eyes to two kits newly born in the Clan, one of whom could fulfill the third role in the prophecy.|$|E

Believers are described as those strictly adhering to the prescribed times, performing them with due regard to their pre-requisites, conditions and articles with clean body and dress, and necessary ablutions. Believers are required to not regard their prayers as an unnecessary burden, completing the task mechanically, but are <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>their</b> recital while being conscious that they are supplicating like humble servants.|$|E
25|$|Each {{test was}} able to {{simultaneously}} illuminate many targets, allowing them to test the amount of x-ray energy needed by placing the targets at different distances from the bomb. Another question was how large the fuel assembly {{had to be in}} order for the fuel to self-heat from the fusion reactions and thus reach ignition. Initial data were available by mid-1984, and the testing ceased in 1988. Ignition was achieved for the first time during these tests, but the amount of energy {{and the size of the}} fuel targets needed to reach ignition was far higher than predicted. During this same period, experiments began on Nova using similar targets <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>their</b> behaviour under laser illumination, allowing direct comparison against the results obtained from the bomb tests.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} climate in Japan was also undergoing changes during this time.

In 1919, Den Kenjirō was appointed to be the first civilian Governor-General of Taiwan. Prior to his departure for Taiwan, he conferred with Prime Minister Hara Takashi, where both men agreed to pursue a policy of , where Taiwan would be viewed as an extension of the Home Islands, and the Taiwanese would be educated <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>their</b> role and responsibilities as Japanese subjects.

By 2050 they are projected to make up one-third of more than 100 million U.S. children. This highlights that children of immigrants in mixed status families are growing in the United States. Therefore, it is of high importance <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>their</b> experiences {{in this country and}} the impact that a mixed status has on the children growing up in these families facing unique needs and challenges. Mixed immigrant families’ rights are being violated. When there is family separation through immigration practices, children in mixed status household are denied the right to grow up with their families. They are dehumanized, based on status of their parents.|$|E

25|$|Molecular {{evolution}} {{gives rise}} to families of related proteins with similar sequence and structure. However, sequence similarities can be extremely low between proteins that share the same structure. Protein structures may be similar because proteins have diverged from a common ancestor. Alternatively, some folds may be more favored than others as they represent stable arrangements of secondary structures and some proteins may converge towards these folds {{over the course of}} evolution. There are currently about 110,000 experimentally determined protein 3D structures deposited within the Protein Data Bank (PDB). However, this set contains many identical or very similar structures. All proteins should be classified to structural families <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>their</b> evolutionary relationships. Structural comparisons are best achieved at the domain level. For this reason many algorithms have been developed to automatically assign domains in proteins with known 3D structure; see 'Domain definition from structural co-ordinates'.|$|E
