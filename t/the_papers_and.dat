5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) starts {{dating a}} Brussels sprout farmer, Esther Bruegger (Nora Kirkpatrick), while {{negotiating}} {{the purchase of}} a tractor with her father Henry (Allan Havey). Dwight does poorly in the negotiations, yielding to all of Henry's terms. During the haggling, Esther's sisters flirt with Clark Green (Clark Duke) and try to coax him into buying farming equipment. Clark stops Dwight from signing <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> <b>and</b> takes him aside to tell him that he thinks Esther and her sisters are too physically attractive to be interested in men like them, and that Esther is probably just dating him so that her father can take advantage of him on the tractor deal. Dwight sees the logic in Clark's suspicion. However, Esther appears and tells Dwight that he should not sign the contract and negotiate for a better deal. Dwight realizes that Esther does care for him after all, much to Angela's dismay.|$|E

25|$|The {{rivalry between}} the two new states {{presented}} a dilemma of {{which was to be}} admitted first. Harrison directed Secretary of State James G. Blaine to shuffle <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> <b>and</b> obscure from him which he was signing first and the actual order went unrecorded, thus no one knows which of the Dakotas was admitted first. However, since North Dakota alphabetically appears before South Dakota, its proclamation was published first in the Statutes At Large. Since then, it has become common to list the Dakotas alphabetically and thus North Dakota is usually listed as the 39thstate.|$|E

25|$|In 1946, Loeb secured {{funding from}} Ridder Publications {{to buy the}} Manchester Union and the Evening Leader from Annie Reid Knox, the widow of former Navy Secretary William Franklin Knox. Mrs. Knox later regretted the sale, {{claiming}} {{she had not seen}} how Loeb handled his Vermont newspapers, and claiming that Loeb did not mention the involvement of the Ridder family. Loeb used $250,000 in funding from his mother's accounts to fund the purchase of his share in <b>the</b> <b>papers,</b> <b>and</b> in 1948 used an additional $300,000 to buy out other shareholders and gain complete control of the papers, which he then merged into the Union Leader.|$|E
25|$|Although {{war crimes}} {{committed}} during the Algerian War are amnestied in France, this was publicised by the newspapers Le Canard Enchaîné, Libération, and Le Monde, and by Michel Rocard (ex-Prime Minister) on TV (TF1 1993). Le Pen sued <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> <b>and</b> Michel Rocard. This affair ended in 2000 when the Cour de cassation (French supreme jurisdiction) {{concluded that it}} was legitimate to publish these assertions. However, because of the amnesty and the statute of limitations, {{there can be no}} criminal proceedings against Le Pen for the crimes he is alleged to have committed in Algeria. In 1995, Le Pen unsuccessfully sued Jean Dufour, regional counselor of the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur (French Communist Party) for the same reason.|$|E
25|$|On April 10, 2006, John Lott {{filed suit}} for {{defamation}} against Steven Levitt and HarperCollins Publishers over the book Freakonomics and against Levitt over {{a series of}} emails to John McCall.

In the emails to economist John McCall, who had pointed to a number of papers in different academic publications that had replicated Lott's work, Levitt wrote that the work by several authors supporting Lott in a special 2001 issue of the Journal of Law and Economics had not been peer reviewed, Lott had paid the University of Chicago Press to publish <b>the</b> <b>papers,</b> <b>and</b> that papers with results opposite of Lott's had been blocked from publication in that issue.|$|E

25|$|On November 17, 1975, {{the police}} began to set forth action {{in order to}} bring down the {{powerful}} Dubois Brothers; they established police task forces and began pressuring the Brothers. After some time the pressure began to deteriorate the Dubois Brothers organization through undercover operations and some of the organizations most notorious and loyal associates began to slip away, become informants or had met violent deaths. <b>The</b> <b>papers</b> <b>and</b> police began stating that never before has the criminal underworld’s law of silence been broken by so many criminals, especially those who were so loyal to the organizations core. Among these numerous informants was Donald Lavoie {{who was one of the}} Dubois Brothers most trusted hitman whose previous occupation had been to eliminate anyone suspected of snitching as well as anyone who they told him to eliminate. It was Donald Lavoie who played the biggest part in the fall of the Dubois Brothers power, when Claude Dubois who had put a bounty on Lavoie’s head, which he just nearly escaped, forcing Lavoie to testify for protection.|$|E

His advance in the {{business}} world was attracting wider notice, and in 1887 he was invited by the Liberal Party in Hornsey to be their candidate in a parliamentary by-election. He accepted, and although defeated, fought a strong campaign which won him a congratulatory letter from William Gladstone. His business affairs were proceeding less serenely; he quarrelled with his partner Douglas MacRae, and the two decided to separate. Bottomley described the [...] "Quixotic impulse" [...] that led him to let MacRae divide the assets: [...] "He was a printer, and I was a journalist—but he took <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> <b>and</b> left me the printing works".|$|E

[...] After the first attempts to ignite the petrol did not work, Linge went back inside the bunker and returned with a thick roll of papers. Bormann lit <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> <b>and</b> threw the torch onto the bodies.

500|$|After graduation, Bengough {{tried his}} hand {{at a number of}} jobs, {{including}} photographer's assistant, and he articled to a lawyer for some time before getting a typesetting job at the Whitby Gazette. [...] The Gazettes editor was George Ham, an extroverted journalist who later worked as public relations chief for the Canadian Pacific Railway. [...] Bengough contributed short local-interest articles. [...] In mid-1870, Ham issued a four-page daily to capitalize on interest in the Franco-Prussian War and commissioned Bengough to provide a serialized novel for it. [...] The popular reception of The Murderer's Scalp (or The Shrieking Ghost of the Bloddy Den) encouraged Bengough to devote himself to a journalism career.

[...] The quality of his drawings varied depending on {{his interest in the}} subject of the assignment, whether or not he agreed with the sentiments portrayed, and on events in his personal life. [...] For example, in March 1914 he was subjected to a blackmail plot by a Mrs. Lambkin, who was seeking a divorce from her husband. [...] Lambkin alleged that McCay's wife Maude was seeing her husband. [...] With McCay's level of fame, such a story would likely be in <b>the</b> <b>papers,</b> <b>and</b> Mrs. Lambkin and her husband told McCay that she would keep it secret for $1,000. [...] McCay did not believe the allegations, and gave testimony at the Lambkins' divorce trial. [...] The blackmail failed, and the divorce was not granted.|$|E
