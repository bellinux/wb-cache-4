50|$|The {{form of an}} <b>object</b> that <b>the</b> mind assumes, {{after coming}} into contact with that object or {{enveloping}} it, is called Vritti. The process of enveloping is called Vritti-Vyapti.

5|$|Cory Shankman et al. {{examined}} {{the consequences of}} a distant massive perturber on the TNOs used to infer the planet's existence. They simulated clones (objects with similar orbits) of 15 objects with semi-major axis > 150 AU and perihelion > 30 AU under the influence of a 10 Earth-massed Planet Nine in Batygin and Brown's best fit orbit. While longitude of perihelion alignment of <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> with semi-major axis > 250 AU was observed in their simulations, the alignment of the arguments of perihelion was not. The simulations also revealed an increase in the inclinations of many objects, thereby predicting a larger reservoir of high-inclination TNOs. These objects should have been detected in existing surveys but are still unseen so far—suggesting there is a currently missing or unseen signature of Planet Nine. A previously published paper concluded that current observations are insufficient to identify this signature, however. The perihelia of many of <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> also rose and fell smoothly, inconsistent with the current absence of extreme TNOs with perihelia between 50 AU and 70 AU. Their perihelia also reached values where <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> would not be observed and, after declining, fell low enough for <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> to enter planet-crossing orbits leading to their ejection from the Solar System. These factors would require a population of Sednas significantly larger than current estimates, and inconsistent with current models of the early Solar System, to explain current observations. Based on these challenges Shankman et al. concluded that the existence of Planet Nine is unlikely and that the currently observed alignment of the existing TNOs is a temporary phenomenon that will disappear as more objects are detected.|$|E

5|$|Planet Nine modifies {{the orbits}} of extreme trans-Neptunian objects via a {{combination}} of secular and resonant dynamics. The secular dynamics acts on very long timescales and causes {{the distance of the}} perihelia of anti-aligned objects to rise and fall while the directions of their perihelia oscillate. The resonant dynamics acts on shorter timescales and provides phase protection, maintaining the stability of <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> by preventing close approaches. The inclination of Planet Nine's orbit weakens this protection, resulting in a chaotic variation of semi-major axes as objects hop between resonances. The orbital poles of <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> circle that of the Solar System's Laplace plane, which is bent toward the plane of Planet Nine's orbit, causing their poles to be clustered toward one side.|$|E

30|$|As stated earlier, {{the methods}} of {{deciding}} the position and direction to push <b>the</b> <b>object,</b> its tilt angle, {{and the location of}} installation of the handcarts are determined by using the method shown in Ref.

Summary of the method is as follows: in calculating the push position and the direction upon <b>the</b> <b>object,</b> several constraints are considered: for <b>the</b> <b>object,</b> pushing position and direction need to be determined for <b>the</b> <b>object</b> not to slide on the floor. They also need to be within the movable range of the end effector. By setting the performance index as to minimize the risk of slip between <b>the</b> <b>object</b> and floor and between <b>the</b> <b>object</b> and <b>the</b> end effector during tilting of <b>the</b> <b>object,</b> <b>the</b> push position and direction on <b>the</b> <b>object</b> are determined. <b>The</b> location of installation of the handcarts under <b>the</b> <b>object</b> is determined to minimize the risk of overturning of <b>the</b> <b>object.</b>|$|R

40|$|A novel {{system and}} method for {{treating}} an object with sonic waveforms.

5|$|The {{remaining}} {{objects in}} the collection display a high quality of craftsmanship such that scholars doubt an indigenous origin.

25|$|Object {{creation}} {{is a process}} in two phases, creation and insertion.

From then on, the lifetime of <b>the</b> <b>object</b> is handled by <b>the</b> <b>object</b> manager, and it's up to the subsystem to keep <b>the</b> <b>object</b> in a working condition until being signaled by <b>the</b> <b>object</b> manager to dispose of it.|$|R
40|$|Systems {{and methods}} for imaging an object using {{backscattered}} radiation are described.

Thus, each detector segment can isolate the desired component of the backscattered radiation. By moving independently of each other about <b>the</b> <b>object,</b> <b>the</b> source and detector can collect multiple images of <b>the</b> <b>object</b> at different angles of rotation and generate a three dimensional reconstruction of <b>the</b> <b>object.</b> Other embodiments are described...|$|R
50|$|An object, when {{deposited}} into a space, {{needs to}} be registered with an <b>Object</b> Directory in <b>the</b> <b>Object</b> Space.

5|$|A {{group is}} a {{mathematical}} structure consisting {{of a set of}} objects together with a binary operation, that is, an operation combining any two objects to a third, subject to certain requirements.

5|$|Although Christ, like man, {{is made in}} {{the image}} of God, he alone shares the {{likeness}} of God the Father. Christ is both sinless and apathetic, and thus by striving to imitate Christ, man can achieve salvation. To Clement, sin is involuntary, and thus irrational , removed only through the wisdom of the Logos. God's guidance of us away from sin is thus a manifestation of God's universal love for mankind. The word play on λόγος and αλόγον is characteristic of Clement's writing, and may be rooted in the Epicurean belief that relationships between words are deeply reflective of relationships between <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> they signify.|$|E
