The RBC plan was first proposed in January 1986, and its final form was announced on July 11, 1988.

40|$|The {{subprime}} crisis {{revealed that the}} adoption of suitable systems {{for the management of}} credit risk is of utmost concern. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2009) advises banks to use credit portfolio models with caution when assessing the capital adequacy.

In other words, do credit portfolio models serve as a relevant determinant for banks to adjust their capital allocation? To empirically test the relationship we measure the average treatment effect by conducting a quasi-natural experiment in which we employ a propensity-matching approach to panel data. We find that the adoption of credit portfolio models positively and significantly affects regulatory capital decisions of banks both directly following the introduction as well as over a longer time horizon. By now it is commonly accepted that overreliance on credit portfolio models composes a fundamental cause of the current financial crisis.

The analysis covers the 15 OECD countries whose banking sectors were most severely hit by the crisis and that provided the largest public bailouts relative to their national gross domestic product (GDP). We show that {{the design of the}} interventions varied considerably across banks and countries. Larger and higher loss-absorbing capital injections were targeted at weaker banks and at banks of 'systemically relevant' size, when the state of public finances allowed. Our results encourage theoretical research with respect to non-linear and potentially adverse effects of bailouts, as well as further investigation into the link between the loss absorbing properties of bank capital and loan growth. With respect to bank lending, we find that only large recapitalizations and infusions of common equity are associated with higher <b>total</b> regulatory <b>capital</b> <b>ratios</b> and sustained loan growth. We find no significant relationship between public capital provisions and interbank lending and challenge the view that local banks increase loan growth relatively more in response to a recapitalization. - Mike Mariathasan and Ouarda Merrouchestatus: publishe...|$|R

The empirical results show that the mean TE of the industry is 1. 50, implying that the cost of inefficiency of the MCCP is 50 percent above the costs defined by the frontier and also provide that the such firm specific factors as the borrowing to <b>total</b> <b>capital</b> <b>ratio,</b> the service to intermediate cost ratio, ownership and location are the determinants of TIE of the chemical industry. Based on the TE analysis, some policy implications are proposed for a better performance of TE in the MCCP. The manufacture of chemicals and chemical products - MCCP, is an important industry that seems to attract the relatively considerable attention of the State of Vietnam. Despite of certain achievements that contribute to scientific and economic development of Vietnam, according to the Ministry of Industry, the chemical industry is of low competitiveness, backward technology, leading to high production costs, high consumption of raw materials, then high prices and poor quality of products. The TE improvement involves the identification of TE level and determinants of TIE, raising the need for the quantitative study on the industry's efficiency performance.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} debate about land {{acquisition}} for infrastructure and industries in many densely populated countries. In this context, the present paper assesses {{the impact of the}} historical land ceiling legislations, largely implemented during 1960 - 85 to promote distributional equity, on corporate investment in India. We argue that the implementation of the land ceiling legislations had increased the transaction costs of buying land and also the price premium firms pay when acquiring land, thus inducing firms to invest less in land and capital. The detrimental ceiling effect is more pronounced when the ceiling size is more restrictive as for the most fertile land. Arguing that the variation in land ceiling size across the Indian states over time was largely dependent on choice of crops or soil fertility and as such could be treated as independent of the state authorities, our results support the conjecture that more restrictive land ceiling size has led to lower investment in both fixed and <b>total</b> <b>capital</b> output <b>ratios</b> at the state-level (1960 - 85). Further analysis of firm-level (1996 - 2012) data confirms that the ceiling effect persists in the long run, thus identifying an unintended consequence of land ceilings for investment and economic growth in the Indian states...|$|R
