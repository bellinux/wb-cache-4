40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in the context of litigation, which occurs with {{reasonable}} frequency in commercial law. The <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> after pendency arises when a litigant assigns his rights or obligations to a third party while the action is pending. This is illustrated by the following short example: A – the owner of some jewelry – brings a suit against B, claiming the restitution of the jewelry, which he lent to B. During the lawsuit, B sells the jewelry to C and tells him about the pending lawsuit, and that A had sold the jewelry to him. However, <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> is not only employed when an individual litigant transfers an asset; it is also relevant in a corporate context when a business organization merges or dissolves pendente lite. As a result, another legal entity is created and, thus, becomes the successor. In this example, the question arises how different legal systems treat the problem of <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> The answers vary and give cause for shedding more light on the respective rules in a civil law country like Germany, whose procedures are characterized as “inquisitorial,” and a common law country, like the U. S., whose procedure is described as “adversarial. ” The procedural rules concerning the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> play a considerable role in modern civil procedure and interestingly have not been subject to any comparative analysis so far. This article will analyze the different concepts of <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> It will focus on the various criteria for substitution and its effects. Furthermore, it will discuss the central objectives of the rules and differences in the legal cultures. Cite as: 19 Annl. Survey Int 2 ̆ 7 l. Comp. L. 301 (2013) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{importance}} of manifolds and Riemannian geometry is spreading to applied fields {{in which the}} need to model non-linear structure has spurred wide-spread interest in geometry. The <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> has created demand for methods for computing classical constructs of geometry on manifolds occurring in practical applications. This paper develops initial value problems for the computation of the differential of the exponential map and Jacobi fields on parametrically and im-plicitly represented manifolds. It is shown how the solution to these problems allow for determining sectional curvatures and provides upper bounds for injectivity radii. In addition, when combined with the second derivative of the exponential map, the initial value problems allow for numerical computation of Principal Geodesic Analysis, a non-linear version of the Principal Component Anal-ysis procedure for estimating variability in datasets. The paper develops algorithms for computing Principal Geodesic Analysis without the tangent space approximation previously used and, thereby, {{provides an example of}} how the constructs of theoretical geometry apply to solving problems in statistics.

40|$|Systems of {{land law}} must balance {{competing}} goals of securing title for existing interests in land with facilitating their transfer. Title registration systems operate to facilitate <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> in land. They reflect {{a choice to}} enhance the security <b>of</b> <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests,</b> providing what has been characterized as dynamic security {{at the expense of}} the static security <b>of</b> existing <b>interests.</b> One <b>of</b> the cardinal principles of title registration is the abolition of the doctrine of notice. In equity, if purchasers <b>of</b> a legal <b>interest</b> have notice <b>of</b> a prior equitable interest, then they take their interest subject to that prior interest.

40|$|The oil {{industry}} {{is no doubt}} facing challenges following the low crude price that since mid 2014 have affected the market. This has likely increased the need to monetize assets, vertically integrate businesses or seek other companies (even competitors) {{for the purpose of}} deepen market and technical expertise and grow market share. As a consequence, mergers and acquisitions in the {{oil industry}} have increased. Participating interest in petroleum projects are also transferred among actors through sale, assignment, encumbrance or other disposition of rights and obligations. Successfully managing a transfer of a participating interest can be very challenging. Recognizing some specific issues early on in a deal will simplify the process and drive these deals for success. One of the key elements to address is rights of pre-emption. This preferential mechanism is commonly found in Joint Operating Agreements (JOAs) in order to grant existent parties to the petroleum project a preferential right to acquire the interest being transferred by one of their co-venturers. However, the inclusion of pre-emption clauses requires careful considerations by the parties to the JOA about the risks associated with pre-emption rights. It may very well be that standardised clauses do not cover innovative methods of transferring interests to parties outside of the JOA. In addition, the interference of the governing law in the construction and interpretation of the contract as well as the hindrances associated with political contexts where the contract area resides will be of most importance when a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> is to take place...|$|E

40|$|This paper extends {{previous}} studies of futures markets to highlight the role of expectations {{in the analysis of}} supply and interest rate shocks. Shocks which are expected to be permanent generally will create larger movements in spot and futures prices than shocks which are regarded as transitory. Further, the reactions of spot and futures prices may differ both qualitatively and quantitatively depending on whether new information refers to events in the current period or to likely developments in some future period. The results demonstrate the potential importance ot capturing expectations effects in empirical studies of futures market behavior. Key words: commodity prices, expectations, futures markets, interest rates. This paper develops a simple analytical framework for examining the responses of spot and futures prices to supply and interest rate shocks. The analysis focuses on the role of expectations as a source of market adjust-ment and draws a clear distinction between the effects of shocks which occur in the cur-rent period and those which are expected to occur in some later period. The analytical framework builds on an earlier contribution by Stein and incorporates recent developments in rational expectations modeling. The results of this paper cast additional light on two issues relevant to the operation of commodity futures markets. The first issue is the role of news concerning the future ex-pected supply of the commodity in question and the effect this has on current prices, in-ventories, and consumption. Most futures markets are regularly supplied with informa-tion relating to current and expected availabil-ity of the commodity, and the results of this analysis provide insight into the implications of these information flows. The second issue addressed in this paper is the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> rate shocks from finan-cial markets to commodity markets. Empirical results presented in Frankel and Hardouvelis highlight the sensitivity of commodity prices to money market shocks, and this paper ana-lyzes these linkages through a portfolio model Gary E.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{reported}} how new credit risk transfer vehicles have {{made it easier to}} reallocate large amounts of credit risk from the financial sector to the non-financial sector of the capital markets. In this article, we describe one of these new credit risk transfer vehicles, the collateralized debt obligation. Synthetic credit debt obligations utilize credit default swaps, another relatively new credit risk transfer vehicle. Financial institutions face five major risks: credit, interest rate, price, currency, and liquidity. The development of the derivatives markets prior to 1990 provided financial institutions with efficient vehicles for the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> rate, price, and currency risks, as well as enhancing the liquidity of the underlying assets. However, it is only in recent years that the market for the efficient transfer of credit risk has developed. Credit risk is the risk that a debt instrument will decline in value {{as a result of the}} borrower's inability (real or perceived) to satisfy the contractual terms of its borrowing arrangement. In the case of corporate debt obligations, credit risk encompasses default, credit spread, and rating downgrade risks. The most obvious way for a financial institution to transfer the credit risk of a loan it has originated is to sell it to another party. Loan covenants typically require that the obligor be informed of the sale. The drawback of a sale in the case of corporate loans is the potential impairment of the originating financial institution's relationship with the obligor of the loan sold. Syndicated loans overcome the drawback of an outright sale because banks in the syndicate may sell their loan shares in the secondary market. The sale may be through an assignment or through participation. While the former mechanism for a syndicated loan requires the approval of the obligor, the latter does not since the payments are merely passed through to the purchaser and therefore the obligor need not know about the sale. Another form of credit risk transfer (CRT) vehicle developed in the 1980 s is securitization [Fabozzi and Kothari (2007) ]. In a securitization, a financial institution that originates loans pools them and sells them to a special purpose entity (SPE). The SPE obtains funds to acquire the pool of loans by issuing securities. Payment of interest and principal on the securities issued by the SPE is obtained from the cash flow of the pool of loans. While the financial institution employing securitization retains some of the credit risk associated with the pool of loans, the majority of the credit risk is transferred to the holders of the securities issued by the SPE. Two recent developments for transferring credit risk are credit derivatives and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). For financial institutions, credit derivatives allow the transfer of credit risk to another party without the sale of the loan. A CDO is an application of the securitization technology. With the development of the credit derivatives market, CDOs can be created without the actual sale of a pool of loans to an SPE using credit derivatives. CDOs created using credit derivatives are referred to as synthetic CDOs. In this article, we discuss CDOs. We begin with the basics of CDOs and then discuss synthetic CDOs. The issues for regulators and supervisors of capital markets with respect to CDOs, as well as credit derivatives, are also discussed.
