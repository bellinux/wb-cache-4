5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century as <b>telephone</b> <b>lines</b> became available, it became popular to add {{telegraph}} onto <b>telephone</b> <b>lines</b> with an earth return phantom circuit. An LC filter was required to prevent telegraph clicks being heard on the telephone line. From the 1920s onwards, <b>telephone</b> <b>lines,</b> or balanced lines dedicated to the purpose, were used for FDM telegraph at audio frequencies. The first of these systems in the UK was a Siemens and Halske installation between London and Manchester. GEC and AT also had FDM systems. Separate pairs were used for the send and receive signals. The Siemens and GEC systems had six channels of telegraph in each direction, the AT system had twelve. All of these systems used electronic oscillators to generate a different carrier for each telegraph signal and required a bank of band-pass filters to separate out the multiplexed signal at the receiving end.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To analyze {{differences}} in sociodemographic characteristics associated with health in individuals {{with and without}} a residential <b>telephone</b> <b>line.</b> METHODS: Data from the ISA-Capital 2003 (2003 Health Survey), a study performed {{in the city of}} São Paulo, Southeastern Brazil, were analyzed. Residents who had a residential <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> were compared to those who reported not having a <b>telephone</b> <b>line,</b> according to sociodemographic, lifestyle, health status and health service use variables. Bias associated with noncoverage of the population without a <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> was estimated, decreasing after the use of post-stratifi cation adjustments. RESULTS: Of all the 1, 878 interviewees aged more than 18 years, 80. 1 % had a residential <b>telephone</b> <b>line.</b> By comparing groups, the main sociodemographic differences among individuals who did not have a residential <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> were the following: younger age, greater proportion of black and mixed individuals, smaller proportion of married interviewees, and greater proportion of unemployed individuals with a lower level of education. Residents without a residential <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> had fewer health tests performed and smoked and drank more. In addition, this group took less medication, considered themselves to be in worse health conditions and used the SUS (National Health System) more frequently. When excluding the population without a <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> from the analysis, estimates of dental consultations, alcoholism, drug use and SUS use to have a Papanicolaou test performed were those showing the highest bias. After post-stratifi cation adjustment, there was a decrease in the bias of estimates for the variables associated with ownership of a residential <b>telephone</b> <b>line.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The exclusion of residents without a <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> {{was one of the main}} limitations to the studies performed in this way. However, the use of statistical techniques of post-stratifi cation adjustment enables a reduction in non-coverage bias...|$|R

5|$|Although an {{air-cooled}} {{design was}} chosen for the reactor at Oak Ridge to facilitate rapid construction, it was recognized {{that this would be}} impractical for the much larger production reactors. Initial designs by the Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont used helium for cooling, before they determined that a water-cooled reactor would be simpler, cheaper and quicker to build. The design did not become available until 4 October 1943; in the meantime, Matthias concentrated on improving the Hanford Site by erecting accommodations, improving the roads, building a railway switch line, and upgrading the electricity, water and <b>telephone</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1943, {{a special}} {{branch of the}} Kempeitai under Lieutenant Colonel Haruzo Sumida was charged with finding the culprits {{responsible}} for acts of sabotage in Singapore, mainly the cutting of <b>telephone</b> <b>lines</b> and the burning of warehouses. Sumida strongly suspected that the saboteurs were being organised by internees in Changi Prison, and made preparations for a raid on the prison to catch the ringleaders. Sumida's chief suspect was British barrister Rob Heeley Scott, a prominent Foreign Office employee who had previously been detained for his anti-Japanese propaganda, released by the Kempeitai, and then later sent to Changi Prison.|$|E
5|$|One of Snedden's first actions was to readdress the paper's {{stance on}} Alaska statehood. Lathrop and the News-Miner had been {{strongly}} opposed to statehood, but after Snedden took control, he analyzed {{the issue and}} came out strongly in favor of Alaska statehood. The News-Miner continually published editorials in favor of statehood, and encouraged other newspapers across the U.S. to do the same. In 1955 and 1956, when the Alaska Constitutional Convention {{took place at the}} University of Alaska Fairbanks, the News-Miner set up special <b>telephone</b> <b>lines</b> from the convention chambers to the newspaper's office. Daily reports were printed, recording the delegates' progress.|$|E

The African Lakes' Company weapons store in Blantyre was raided by a force of around 100 rebels at around 02:00 on 24 January, before the general alarm had been raised by news of the Magomero and Mwanje attacks. The {{defenders}} mobilised after an African watchman was shot dead by the rebels. The insurgents were repulsed, but not before they had captured five rifles and some ammunition, which was taken back to Mbombwe.

5|$|The {{threat of}} the storm {{prompted}} hurricane warnings in the southeastern United States, resulting in the evacuation of tourists on Labor Day Weekend. Able produced heavy rainfall from Florida through New England, which caused widespread flooding. The city struck by the hurricane was heavily damaged and briefly isolated due to downed power and <b>telephone</b> <b>lines.</b> Overall damage in the United States totaled $2.75million (1952USD, $ USD), mostly from crop damage in South Carolina. Further north, Able produced flooding and gusty winds, which washed out {{a portion of the}} Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.|$|E

5|$|After the {{collapse}} of public enterprises during the late 1980s, privatisation became strongly popular. Menem privatised almost everything the state owned, except {{for a couple of}} banks. In terms of service there were indisputable improvements. For example, before the telephone privatisation, to get a new line it was not unusual to wait more than ten years, and apartments with <b>telephone</b> <b>lines</b> carried a big premium in the market. After privatisation the wait was reduced to less than a week. Productivity increased as investment modernised farms, factories and ports. However, in all cases, there were large outlays of employees. In addition, the process of privatisation was suspected of corruption in many cases. Ultimately, the privatised enterprises became private (rather than public) monopolies. Their tariffs on long-term contracts were raised in line with American inflation, even though prices in Argentina were falling.|$|E
5|$|By 27 April, Berlin was cut {{off from}} the rest of Germany. Secure radio {{communications}} with defending units had been lost; the command staff in the bunker had to depend on <b>telephone</b> <b>lines</b> for passing instructions and orders and on public radio for news and information. On 28 April, a BBC report originating from Reuters was picked up; a copy of the message was given to Hitler. The report stated that Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler had offered to surrender to the western Allies; the offer had been declined. Himmler had implied to the Allies that he had the authority to negotiate a surrender; Hitler considered this treason. During the afternoon his anger and bitterness escalated into a rage against Himmler. Hitler ordered Himmler's arrest and had Hermann Fegelein (Himmler's SS representative at Hitler's headquarters in Berlin) shot.|$|E
5|$|Chauvel assumed {{command of}} the newly formed Anzac Mounted Division on 16 March 1916, the day after it {{relieved}} the 1st Division on the Suez Canal defences. Chauvel was again mentioned in despatches {{for his part in}} the defence of the Canal. His division was committed to No. 3 Section of the Suez Canal Defences, {{the northern part of the}} Canal, under Major General H. A. Lawrence. Arrangements were far from ideal. The mounted troops were parcelled out so that only two brigades of the Anzac Mounted Division remained under Chauvel's command. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade had been placed under No. 2 Section by General Sir Archibald Murray GHQ Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF). Lawrence was too far away to control the battle, especially once the <b>telephone</b> <b>lines</b> were cut. Murray, in Ismailia, was even further back.|$|E
