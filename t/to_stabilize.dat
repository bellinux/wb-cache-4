5|$|The domes {{and drums}} {{typically}} incorporated wooden tension rings at several levels to resist deformation in the mortar {{and allow for}} faster construction. Metal clamps between stone cornice blocks, metal tie rods, and metal chains were also used <b>to</b> <b>stabilize</b> domed buildings. Timber belts at the bases of domes helped <b>to</b> <b>stabilize</b> the walls below them during earthquakes, but the domes themselves remained vulnerable to collapse. The surviving ribbed or pumpkin dome examples in Constantinople are structurally equivalent and those techniques were used interchangeably, {{with the number of}} divisions corresponding to the number of windows. Aided by the small scale of churches after the 6th century, such ribbed domes could be built with formwork only for the ribs. Pumpkin domes could have been built in self-supporting rings and small domical vaults were effectively corbelled, dispensing with formwork altogether.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} {{switching}} the dominant use of household-specific sticky wages in the New Keynesian model (Erceg, Henderson, and Levin 2000) for firm-specific sticky wages has {{qualitative and quantitative}} consequences. First, the model with firm-specific sticky wages incorporates endogenous changes {{in the rate of}} unemployment, whereas there is no unemployment with household-specific sticky wages. Secondly, business-cycle fluctuations of wage inflation and the real wage are clearly distinguishable. In particular, the real wage is countercyclical after a demand shock under any sensible calibration with firm-specific sticky wages, whereas the model with household-specific sticky wages requires larger wage stickiness than price stickiness. Finally, optimal monetary policy is more oriented <b>to</b> <b>stabilizing</b> price inflation with firm-specific sticky wages, and is more oriented <b>to</b> <b>stabilizing</b> the output gap and wage inflation with household-specific sticky wages. ...|$|R

The earthquake severely damaged three of the four pinnacles (corner spires) on the central tower of the Washington National Cathedral, cracked some of its flying buttresses, and caused additional damage. As the cathedral's insurance policy did not cover earthquake damage, cathedral officials stated that they would need to raise millions of dollars to fully evaluate the damage and <b>to</b> <b>stabilize</b> and repair its limestone exterior.|$|E
