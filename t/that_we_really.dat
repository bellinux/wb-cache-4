It's {{a way for}} me to remain blessedly free of conscience. But for me the beauty of that scene was <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> dared to get into it. Typically in TV shows we skim over the edges of issues like water spiders, spouting platitudes and spouting unearned 'clarifying' emotions. But there were no violins strumming in 'Black and Blue'." ...|$|E

500|$|We {{really wanted}} to spend time, immerse ourselves, drive {{for hours and hours}} aimlessly with a camera, jumping out and {{shooting}} things that caught my eye. We didn't want to go there and just shoot Frenchy's Chicken and call it an [...] "authentic video." [...] There was tons of hanging out, getting the feel, all with cameras ready. We hooked up with our dude Scotty who was a great help, plus Bun B's brother Truck, and Paul Wall. The city was so receptive, so willing to help, so open, and that leant a lot to the fact <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> got to glimpse of the real character of Houston.|$|E
500|$|I have no {{argument}} with someone having a fundamentalist belief in Christianity or Islam or Judaism or Buddhism or anything else, but I {{do have a}} serious objection to people trying to impose their values on other people. [...] And that's what this episode is about. No one {{has the right to}} force anyone to believe the things that they believe. That's one of the beautiful things about Gene Roddenberry's vision of IDIC (Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations), {{and that was one of}} the things <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> wanted to hammer home here. Sisko does everything he can not to impose his values on the Bajorans, but Vedek Winn is determined to impose her values on everyone.|$|E
500|$|Daniel Hales, {{brother of}} the organisation's {{worldwide}} leader Bruce Hales, described the book {{as part of a}} trend of what he said were lies told about his group by critics and disaffected former members. He said such criticism showed it is [...] "open season to kill us". [...] "We're happy to live our lives in anonymity, just quietly in our neighbourhoods in our low-key way. We're quite happy to have our beliefs questioned, ethically debated, and points of religion looked at. That's not a problem. We don't mind being criticised. We don't even mind being despised because of it. But once it starts to be charged that we're acting criminally, we're acting illegally, we're acting immorally, we're acting against society, then we felt <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> had to put our point of view. We felt that it wasn't fair to our members," [...] said Daniel Hales to The West Australian.|$|E

500|$|Rubin {{encouraged}} a [...] "back to basics" [...] approach and wanted {{the group to}} bring finished songs to the studio. This approach conflicted with U2's freeform recording style, by which they improvised material in the studio. The Edge said, [...] "we sort of hadn't really finished the songs. It's typical for us, because it's {{in the process of}} recording <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> do our writing." [...] Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "once we have a song, we're interested in the atmospherics and the tones and the overdubs and the different stuff you can do with it... things that Rick was not in the slightest bit interested in. He was interested in getting it from embryonic stage to a song that could be mixed and put on a record." [...] They ultimately decided to shelve the material recorded with Rubin, but expressed interest in revisiting it in the future.|$|E
500|$|Having {{fulfilled}} {{their creative}} intentions with The Revival, Tony! Toni! Toné! wanted {{to pay homage}} to their musical influences with Sons of Soul. In a 1993 interview for The New York Times, Wiggins elaborated on their direction for the album, stating [...] "We're paying homage to a lot of older artists who paved the way for us artists like the Temptations, Sly and the Family Stone, Earth, Wind and Fire. They're the people who inspired us when we were growing up, people like Aretha Franklin, James Brown. We feel we're the sons of everything and all those people who came before us." [...] He also explained the album's title as a declaration of them being descendants of those artists, [...] "not in a grandiose sense, but from the standpoint <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> are the musical offspring of all that's come before us... paying homage to our past, but creating in a contemporary environment." ...|$|E
500|$|Most of xx was {{recorded}} from late December to late January before McDonald and Smith began an exhaustive mixing process, which lasted two weeks. For each song, they mixed {{one or two}} tracks of each instrument and used Waves Audio components to equalize the recordings. Having enjoyed how the demos captured unintended background noises such as street sounds, McDonald deliberately left certain sounds that would have otherwise been unwanted in the final mix. [...] "I wanted it to sound like people in a room, rather than this polished kind of perfect crystalline thing", he explained. [...] "It was all the small details <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> liked." [...] In February, the group wrote and recorded [...] "Fantasy", [...] "Shelter", and [...] "Infinity" [...] before finishing xx by month's end. Sim sang his vocals for [...] "Infinity" [...] {{on the side of}} the studio opposite from Croft after his microphone had been unintentionally moved there, which resulted in a distant-sounding vocal exchange on the song. While recording [...] "Shelter", a mechanical part from the guitar amplifier loosened and caused it to make a clattering sound, which McDonald and the xx chose to retain. [...] "It was just like this missing piece of percussion that the track needed!", McDonald recalled.|$|E

500|$|A {{music video}} was {{produced}} for the song, {{but it was}} never officially released. Stefani's long time collaborator, Sophie Muller, directed the music video during Gwen's first concert tour entitled Harajuku Lovers Tour. A minute long clip of the video surfaced on YouTube on October 13, 2006. At the beginning of the clip, Stefani and her dance troupe, the Harajuku Girls, are shown dancing on various rooftops in a city. The women also appear in front of a yellow building advertisement that reads [...] "Cash Loan" [...] in a red font, followed by [...] "Buy · Sell · Trade" [...] in a green font below. The ladies sport [...] "'80s hairstyles", to which a critic from Spin predicted was in an attempt [...] "to rival some of the best videos from two decades ago". Other parts of the video display the dancers wearing jumpsuits or camouflage outfits; Stefani also wears a denim skirt or a pair of white shorts with a matching tank top. The clip was featured in a list compiled by VH1's Christopher Rosa, titled [...] "8 Amazing Unreleased Music Videos <b>That</b> <b>We</b> <b>Really</b> Need To See". Rosa noted that the video [...] "is now virtually unfindable on the Web", and was disappointed by stating: [...] "We wanted some Madonna realness, Gwen!" ...|$|E
500|$|Burt is {{the father}} of glee club member Kurt Hummel. Colfer has {{credited}} his off-screen relationship with O'Malley with improving the quality of their scenes together, and O'Malley has said the same about working with Colfer. Burt loves Kurt, and openly accepts his son after Kurt tells him that he is gay in the show's fourth episode, [...] "Preggers". Murphy took the scene verbatim from his own experience of coming out to his father. He called the father-son relationship [...] "One of the stories <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> love on the show", and one that is [...] "very personal" [...] to him, as he wishes his own father had acted more like Burt. During the first season, Kurt has cause to wonder whether his father truly accepts him. Colfer offered the insight that his character is [...] "more concerned with being OK in his dad's eyes than with anyone else", and said that the bond between them would continue to strengthen as the series progressed. From O'Malley's point of view, [...] "There's a lot at stake in their relationship and [...] trying to show other people how it can be, in a positive way. I'm not saying hey, let's go to Greenwich Village and be in the parade. This is very very difficult, but he loves his son." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the record}} neared {{completion}} by August 2003, the band performed {{for a short}} time for the armed forces in the Middle East and premiered more new songs at their Reading and Leeds sets. The trio shot small, home-made videos for several songs on Blink-182, as well as the official music video for [...] "Feeling This", the song they picked as the first single. The band spent time to finalize the CD booklet and album artwork in September. Mark Hoppus stated that the album was so [...] "personal to all three of us <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> wanted to be involved in every aspect of it." [...] The release date kept getting missed and pushed back to the point where Jordan Schur, then-president of Geffen Records, made calls asking, [...] "What is the absolute last possible second that we can turn this thing in and still make our release date?" [...] DeLonge described the final days of mixing the album as [...] "crazy stressful", with [...] "literally hours to turn [...] to have it come it out on time." [...] The album was in production so late that final mixes were still being judged by Hoppus, DeLonge, and Barker the night before the album was sent to the pressing plant. For Barker, he later considered it his favorite time in the band's history, commenting, [...] "That was a good time in my life. I was smoking just enough weed and taking just enough pills." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviews for [...] "Right Round" [...] {{were mostly}} negative. A {{reviewer}} for The New York Times called the song [...] "ionic and empty". In {{a review of}} R.O.O.T.S., Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe stated, [...] "His music is pure ear candy that must make Britney [...] envious, yet he wants to come off as a thug." [...] He continued that {{it is unlikely that}} [...] "Right Round" [...] would have gone over well in Brooklyn in the '80s, calling it [...] "as hard as Jell-O." [...] Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy stated in his review of the song, [...] "It's pretty difficult to ruin a pop classic, but Flo Rida gives it a pretty good stab here." [...] He added that [...] "Right Round" [...] is [...] "illed with more misogyny than a 1970s working mens' club", and called it [...] "an unpleasant affair that's only saved from the trashcan by its sample." [...] Fletcher concluded, [...] "The fuzzy synths, electro beats and infectious chorus hook sung by Kesha are almost enough to fool the casual listener into enjoying themselves. But sadly it's never too long before Flo Rida turns up again to spoil things." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly called the song [...] "a horrendous rap remake of Dead or Alive's 'You Spin Me Round (Like a Record).'" [...] Noting that the song was, at the time, the number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100, he added, [...] "What does all this say about us as a society? Mainly <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>really,</b> really enjoy cheesetastic '80s hair-pop hits in whatever form we can get 'em, I guess." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{contains}} {{a scene in}} which the survivors pull a bloated walker out of a well in order to prevent contamination of the water. Such attempts prove to be unsuccessful, as all of the water retention severs the walker in half. Greg Nicotero, the special effects director for The Walking Dead, collaborated with KNB Efx Group to produce the sequence. Nicotero {{received a phone call from}} staff members of the company two hours after leaving production offices. They devised and expressed plans of creating a scenario in which a walker falls into a well. Nicotero worked with KNB Efx Group in several other films in the past. [...] "One of the things we've noticed—looking at some morgue research and cadaver research—is that everything gets really swollen," [...] he articulated. [...] "The liquid saturates the skin so much that it swells up, and the skin starts to split. That was one of the things <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> wanted to play up." [...] A costume was sculpted using a body and a head cast. It was composed of three layers; a thin skin-like substance covers the exterior of the suit, followed by a layer of silicone and a layer of foam in the costume's center. A mask that was previously utilized in the action horror film Grindhouse (2007) was used as part of the costume. Nicotero inserted water balloons between the silicone and foam layering. He explained that as the performer begins to move, the liquid transfers from one side of the costume to another. Nicotero added: [...] "If we made it out of foam latex, it would've been stiff. But we used silicone that was heavily plasticized—which means that the silicone was really soft." [...] The suit weighed approximately sixty pounds.|$|E

Ranaldo said, [...] "It was the first record company we were on <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> would have given anything to be on." [...] Sonic Youth eventually signed to the label in early 1986 and began recording EVOL with Martin Bisi in March of that year.|$|E

He's really destructive, which we love to see. He's flexible - he can bat close to the top or in the lower order. And he's a handy offspin bowler, and that was an area where we felt we needed a bit more cover." ...|$|E

[...] I think {{for those of us who}} believe in inclusion, that comes from a point of view <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> believe that Jesus was for inclusion; we believe that God is for inclusion; and we believe in a God of love.
