But my conviction is that I have suffered for things that I am guilty of. I am suffering because I am a radical and indeed I am a radical; I have suffered because I am an Italian and indeed I am an Italian...if you could execute me two times, and if I could be reborn two other times, I would live again to do what I have done already.|$|E
500|$|Discussing his onscreen {{relationship}} with Yang, McKidd said: [...] "It's {{not going to}} be easy for <b>them.</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> read when I read the season premiere, and this is just my take on it, is that it was very much two very analytical people, Owen and Cristina. They're very similar in a way, I think, as people. Two analytical people see each other over a crowded ER room and their eyes meet." [...] On the topic of Yang's triumphs and challenges in the eighth season, Oh said: [...] "It has been an extremely challenging year that has had a lot of ups and downs, both challenging and exhilarating. We would shoot all our scenes for a day or two straight, and that was extremely challenging because emotionally and physically it becomes really exhausting." ...|$|E
500|$|Through {{the early}} 19th century, Thompson {{continued}} to trade furs throughout the Kootenay region for the North West Company, {{and for the}} few years {{when he had a}} total monopoly over the Canadian fur trade west of the Rockies, he outlawed alcoholic drinks altogether. He was known to have written [...] "I had made it a law to myself that no alcohol should pass the mountains in my company". When two of Thompson's trading partners tried to make him take two barrels of rum to Kootanae House, Thompson [...] "placed the two kegs on a vicious horse and by noon the kegs were empty and in pieces, the horse rubbing his load against the rocks {{to get rid of it}} … I told <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had done, and that I would do the same to every keg of alcohol." [...] Of course, wine, beer, rum and other intoxicating drinks were imported in time.|$|E

6000|$|... "It’s been {{worrying}} me ever since, sir," [...] persisted Tim, who {{was half}} fainting. [...] "I’ve been wondering whether I {{ought to have}} answered them ladies’ questions, and told <b>’em</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did tell ’em." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So on Saturday I gave ’em a week’s notice," [...] {{continued}} her husband, [...] "and after Potts and Co. had listened while <b>I</b> told <b>’em</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> thought of <b>’em,</b> they said they’d {{do without the}} week’s notice." ...|$|R
2500|$|I wasn't trying to, quote, [...] "Americanize" [...] <b>them...</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> {{was trying}} to do is translate, which I think is different. I {{wanted to make sure that}} an American kid reading the book would have the same {{literary}} experience that a British kid would have." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{team was}} on a {{campaign}} and I didn't want to jeopardise it so I just tried to keep myself up. I had a few talks with Bob [...] and Bruce [...] but I didn't tell <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> thought it was. I didn't want to worry anyone because we all had a job to do... and we did the job." ...|$|E
2500|$|His former ELP bandmates, Carl Palmer and Greg Lake, both issued {{statements}} on his death. Palmer said, [...] "Keith was a gentle soul whose love {{for music and}} passion for his performance as a keyboard player will remain unmatched {{for many years to}} come." [...] Lake said, [...] "As sad and tragic as Keith's death is, I would not want this to be the lasting memory people take away with <b>them.</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> will always remember about Keith Emerson was his remarkable talent as a musician and composer and his gift and passion to entertain. Music was his life and despite some of the difficulties he encountered I am sure that the music he created will live on forever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But just wait," [...] he said, {{to some of}} the students. [...] "I'll show <b>'em</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can do when we get {{to playing}} hockey." [...] And that very night he started in to {{organize}} an ice-hockey team. He did not consult Mr. Dodsworth or Andrew Dale, fearing that they would not favor his selection of players.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Most certain!' she exclaimed, {{with full}} sincerity; 'I am {{not at all}} ready for <b>them.</b> <b>What</b> should <b>I</b> do with them to entertain?' ...|$|R
30|$|Some {{informants}} had overlapping {{roles that}} spanned {{more than one}} category. In these cases <b>I</b> assigned <b>them</b> to <b>what</b> <b>I</b> considered to be their primary category.|$|R
60|$|We {{began to}} talk about my aunt's losses, and I told <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had tried to do that morning.|$|E
60|$|I felt {{foolish and}} angry. I tried and found I {{could not tell}} <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had seen. They laughed again at my broken sentences.|$|E
6000|$|... "Got me on both sides. Darn it! Well, {{when they}} haul {{me up on}} the carpet I'll have the {{pleasure}} of telling <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> think of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{a moment}} it had gone and I was telling <b>them</b> of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had learned. They listened till I had finished. Then Anscombe said slowly-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Casual curiosity {{prompted}} me {{to decipher}} <b>them,</b> but <b>what</b> <b>I</b> read carried no immediate meaning to my mind. There were {{three sets of}} characters, one below another: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Trust him for that, sir!' said Betty, cheerfully. 'Though he had {{need to be}} {{something}} quick about it, for I'm a getting {{to be an old}} one. But I'm a strong one too, and travel and weather never hurt me yet! Now, be so kind as speak for me to your lady and gentleman, and tell <b>'em</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> ask of their good friendliness to let me do, and why I ask it.' ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. BRADMERE. My goodness! Yes! The men are all {{up at the}} inn. Go {{and tell}} <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> said--it's not to get about. Go at once, Burlacombe.|$|E
6000|$|How could I even {{attempt to}} follow such a speaker with {{any hope of}} success? I simply told <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had already done {{in the way of}} help, saying: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now tell <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{have come}} for, Abdul, and please keep the {{umbrella}} well up. I think I shall reserve myself for my little vernacular {{speech at the}} end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, no. Nonsense. Upon my word I've {{no right}} to draw the commission,' said the doctor, 'I haven't really. It's picking your pocket. I don't {{recommend}} anybody here. <b>I</b> only say <b>what</b> <b>I</b> know. My patients ask me <b>what</b> <b>I</b> know, and <b>I</b> tell <b>'em</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> know. Nothing else. Caution is my weak side, that's the truth; and always was from a boy. That is,' said the doctor, filling his glass, 'caution in behalf of other people. Whether I would repose confidence in this company myself, if I had not been paying money elsewhere for many years--that's quite another question.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What is {{the meaning}} of this foolery?' he asked, {{pointing}} to Psmith's gloves and hat. 'Suppose Mr Bickersdyke had come round and seen <b>them,</b> <b>what</b> should <b>I</b> have said?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, let <b>them!</b> <b>What</b> do <b>I</b> care? Suppose, for argument's sake, {{that these}} Voices do come {{from my father}} and my grandfather. What do they know of this great city? They were country folks. How can they direct me in <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can tell}} <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> said," [...] said the youth; [...] "And {{they may find}} it to their {{interest}} to call up Mr. Belright Fogg before they give you orders." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Lillie, I am {{interested}} in my Sunday school. I know all my people, and they know me; {{and no one else}} in the world could do for <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> could." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, come on, what's the use {{of talking}} to them?" [...] growled Link Merwell. [...] "Some day I'll show <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can do!" [...] And he moved on along the ledge.|$|E

6000|$|There the youth's look {{of utter}} horror and misery shocked and startled them all, and he groaned rather than said, 'Left there! Left to <b>them!</b> <b>What</b> have <b>I</b> done {{to leave her}} there?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pooh!" [...] {{interrupted}} the sailor, [...] "that's not the luck I'm thinkin' of. Havin' overhauled Roarin' Bull an' {{his little girl}} in time to help rescue <b>them,</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> call luck--d'ee see?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They are as they are," [...] {{replied the}} professor. [...] "I shall do for <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can--when I am gone they must look to themselves. I can see {{no way out}} of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's my way too, Tom," [...] said my burly neighbour. [...] "If {{they put}} down a guinea on the counter--which they do if they 'ave been drinkin' very 'eavy--I give <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> think is about a guinea's worth and take the money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Hartley was not {{particularly}} communicative about your affairs," [...] said the General; [...] "nor do I wish {{to give you the}} pain of entering into <b>them.</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> desire to know is, if you are pleased with your destination to Madras?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But <b>what</b> am <b>I</b> {{to say to}} <b>them?</b> <b>What</b> {{explanation}} can <b>I</b> give? <b>What</b> {{story can}} <b>I</b> tell them? Can't you see what a hole you've put me in?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did I do that, Sam? Oh, what {{a foolish}} thing to do! Yes, we must help <b>them!</b> <b>What</b> shall <b>I</b> do? I'll jump down after {{them if you}} say so!" [...] And Tom started forward.|$|R
60|$|My sister told me (when we said good-by) to be {{particular}} in writing down my true {{opinion of the}} Staveleys. Helena wishes to compare what she thinks of <b>them</b> with <b>what</b> <b>I</b> think of <b>them.</b>|$|R
