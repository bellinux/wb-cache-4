500|$|The {{video is}} similar in {{thematic}} content to Mötley Crüe's video for the single [...] "Girls, Girls, Girls". But in contrast, this video tells the story from Madonna's point of view. [...] She looks down into the cubicles <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> with the men but {{they are unable to}} return it. She also looks assertively into the camera, making eye contact with the viewer. With these scenes Madonna portrays her holding power over the men and the ability to pursue them. Madonna represents an assertive woman searching for a lover who can accept her as a human being. Author Bruce Forbes notes that the men in the cubicles are proved unworthy of her and there is an undertone of mockery when Madonna addresses them as 'baby' while shaking her body.|$|E

500|$|A {{few members}} of Cho's family, those who {{remained}} in South Korea, had concerns about his behavior during his early childhood. Cho's relatives {{thought that he was}} selectively mute or mentally ill. According to Cho's uncle, Cho [...] "didn't say much and did not mix with other children." [...] Cho's maternal great-aunt described Cho as [...] "cold" [...] and a cause of family concern from as young as eight years old. According to his great-aunt, who met him twice, Cho was extremely shy and [...] "just would not talk at all." [...] He was otherwise considered [...] "well-behaved," [...] readily obeying verbal commands and cues. The great-aunt said she knew something was wrong after the family's departure for the United States because she heard frequent updates about Cho's older sister but little news about Cho. During an ABC News Nightline interview on August 30, 2007, Cho's grandfather reported his concerns about Cho's behavior during childhood. According to Cho's grandfather, Cho never looked up to him <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>eye</b> <b>contact,</b> never called him grandfather, and never moved to embrace him.|$|E
500|$|A common {{feature of}} this form of {{diagnosis}} within attachment therapy {{is the use of}} extensive lists of [...] "symptoms" [...] which include many behaviours that are likely to be a consequence of neglect or abuse, but are not related to attachment, or not related to any clinical disorder at all. Such lists have been described as [...] "wildly inclusive". The APSAC Taskforce (2006) gives examples of such lists ranging across multiple domains from some elements within the DSM-IV criteria to entirely non-specific behavior such as developmental lags, destructive behaviors, refusal <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>eye</b> <b>contact,</b> cruelty to animals and siblings, lack of cause and effect thinking, preoccupation with fire, blood and gore, poor peer relationships, stealing, lying, lack of a conscience, persistent nonsense questions or incessant chatter, poor impulse control, abnormal speech patterns, fighting for control over everything, and hoarding or gorging on food. Some checklists suggest that among infants, [...] "prefers dad to mom" [...] or [...] "wants to hold the bottle as soon as possible" [...] are indicative of attachment problems. The APSAC Taskforce expresses concern that high rates of false positive diagnoses are virtually certain and that posting these types of lists on web sites that also serve as marketing tools may lead many parents or others to conclude inaccurately that their children have attachment disorders." ...|$|E

50|$|Much like DI and HI, Duo Interpretation pieces have {{at least}} two parts, to be {{performed}} by two people. The principles are generally the same, except there are two performers instead of just one. In Duo, the actors are not allowed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> physical or <b>eye</b> <b>contact,</b> or use props. They are also not permitted to touch the ground with anything but their feet. Remember that rules will vary with district regulations. Many High school districts, in many states, have yet to add the event for competitors. Some states such as Texas (TFA) are altering duo for duet as a permanent change.|$|R
5000|$|This {{exploration}} in reducing {{dance to the}} essentials climaxed with one of Rainer’s most famous pieces, Trio A (1966), initially {{part of a larger}} work entitled The Mind Is a Muscle. Something of a paradigmatic statement that questioned the aesthetic goals of postmodern dance, Trio A was a short dance that consisted of one long phrase. In Trio A, Rainer attempted to remove objects from the dance while simultaneously retaining a workmanlike approach of task-based performance. During this time, Rainer was invested in making dance [...] "easier to see", or otherwise more accessible to the viewer. Her choice in [...] "Trio A" [...] to execute movements with an even distribution of energy, reflected such a desire. However, though Rainer also used repetition in earlier works as a device <b>to</b> <b>make</b> movement easier <b>to</b> read, she decided to break away from previous choreographic choices and not repeat any movements in the piece. Trio A {{is often referred to as}} a task-oriented performance, due to this style of energy distribution, as well as an emphasis on a neutral approach to movement execution and a lack of interaction with the audience. The dancer was <b>to</b> never <b>make</b> <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> with her observers, and in the case that the movement required the dancer to face the audience, the eyes were to be averted from the audience or the head was to be involved in movement. As the Museum of Modern Art describes it: [...] "It freed the dancer's body from the rigid fragmentation and artificiality of choreographed movement." [...] The first time the piece was performed it was entitled The Mind is a Muscle, Part 1, and was performed by a set of three simultaneous solos by Rainer, Steve Paxton, and David Gordon. Trio A has been widely adapted and interpreted by other choreographers.|$|R
2500|$|In a seeming anachronism, the {{painting}} shows sheep being shorn with blade shears {{rather than the}} machine shears which started to enter Australian shearing sheds in the late 1880s. Art historian Terry Smith's suggestion that Roberts presented a deliberately historical vision of shearing has been questioned on account of there being no evidence that electric shears had been introduced to [...] "Brocklesby" [...] {{at the time of}} {{the painting}}'s composition. The young man carrying the fleece on the left of the painting alludes to the figure of Esau in Ghiberti's Gates of Paradise at the Florence Baptistery.
