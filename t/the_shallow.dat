5|$|The jacanas are a {{group of}} {{tropical}} waders in the family Jacanidae. They are found throughout the tropics. They are identifiable by their huge feet and claws which enable them to walk on floating vegetation in <b>the</b> <b>shallow</b> lakes that are their preferred habitat.|$|E
30|$|The {{accuracy}} of the simulated result in <b>the</b> <b>shallower</b> region may not be well guaranteed. Furthermore, the modeled fault does not reach the free surface. These factors result in an underestimation of the final slips in <b>the</b> <b>shallower</b> region compared to the inversion results. However, we point out that a significant effect from <b>the</b> <b>shallower</b> region is not required for the multi-event generation.|$|R
30|$|Our results {{indicate}} that the stress state is very different between <b>the</b> <b>shallower</b> and deeper regions. Though the initial stress in <b>the</b> <b>shallower</b> region is barely above the dynamic strength, the reflected waves inside the front wedge induce a high transient stress drop and large final slip, but no significant overshoot is found. Based on the consistency of our result and the observations, we infer that the initial stress in <b>the</b> <b>shallower</b> region is very low compared to the static strength. Thus, {{it would be difficult to}} nucleate an earthquake in <b>the</b> <b>shallower</b> region, but <b>the</b> final slip will always be amplified once the rupture propagates through. This behavior should naturally exist in shallow subduction events. A lower initial stress (e.g. equal to the dynamic strength) still allows the rupture to break up to the trench, but leads to a small final slip (< 50 m) in <b>the</b> <b>shallower</b> region.|$|R

5|$|Admiral Chichagov, {{named for}} Admiral Vasily Chichagov, was ordered on 4 June 1865 from the Semiannikov & Poletika Shipyard, Saint Petersburg, {{although}} the formal keel-laying {{was not until}} 20 November 1866. Construction was delayed by changes to the design and late deliveries of components. She was launched on 28 August 1868 and then transferred to Kronstadt for fitting out as <b>the</b> <b>shallow</b> waters around Saint Petersburg prevented deep-draft ships from being completed. This added more delays as the dockyard there lacked the equipment to efficiently fit out the ships, and she officially entered service in 1869 {{at the cost of}} 1,177,500 rubles.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} {{blacktip reef shark}} (C. melanopterus) and the whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon obesus), the grey reef shark {{is one of the}} three most common sharks inhabiting Indo-Pacific reefs. They {{actively}} expel most other shark species from favored habitats, even species larger in size. In areas where this species co-exists with the blacktip reef shark, the latter species occupies <b>the</b> <b>shallow</b> flats, while the former stays in deeper water. Areas with a high abundance of grey reef sharks tend to contain few sandbar sharks (C. plumbeus), and vice versa; {{this may be due to}} their similar diets causing competitive exclusion.|$|E
5|$|During the Kimmeridgian, Europe {{was covered}} by <b>the</b> <b>shallow</b> inland Tethys Ocean, with exposed landmasses being a series of {{scattered}} archipelagos. Highly variable sea levels supported a highly diverse insular crocodilian fauna, with biodiversity (that of atoposaurids in particular) being driven strongly by allopatric speciation. The two species of Knoetschkesuchus were part of similar faunas, in both of which they functioned as small predators ecologically partitioned from the other contemporary crocodilians; {{it is likely that}} these faunas originated through dispersal over larger landmasses. A similar faunal exchange occurred with the Wessex-Weald Basin of England.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} half of the 17th century, Swedish {{warships}} were built in the Dutch manner, with a flat, rectangular bottom with a small draft. This shipbuilding style was adapted mainly for smaller ships in <b>the</b> <b>shallow</b> coastal waters of the Netherlands, and allowed for quick construction, but these less sturdy vessels were generally unsuitable as warships and somewhat unstable in rough seas. When Kronan was built, the English approach to building had prevailed, giving hulls a more rounded bottom and greater draft, as well as a sturdier frame and increased stability. The stern was more streamlined below the waterline, which lessened resistance.|$|E

5|$|For {{that entire}} day the Comanches plundered and burned buildings, draping {{themselves}} grandly in top hats and stolen linens.

5|$|It {{is often}} {{held that the}} Renown and Courageous classes were {{designed}} for Fisher's plan to land troops (possibly Russian) on the German Baltic coast. Specifically, they were designed with a reduced draught, which might be important in <b>the</b> <b>shallow</b> Baltic. This is not clear-cut evidence that the ships were designed for the Baltic: it was considered that earlier ships had too much draught and not enough freeboard under operational conditions. Roberts argues that {{the focus on the}} Baltic was probably unimportant at the time the ships were designed, but was inflated later, after the disastrous Dardanelles Campaign.|$|E

An intensive German barrage decimated the occupants of the second-line trenches, while the 10th's temporary commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel E.G. Thin, was wounded by gunfire. The remainder of the Liverpool Scottish continued onto the third-line with portions of the Royal Scots Fusiliers and 1st Northumberland Fusiliers.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises, {{along with}} whales and dolphins, are {{descendants}} of land-living ungulates (hoofed animals) that first entered the oceans around 50 {{million years ago}} (Mya). During the Miocene (23 to 5 Mya), mammals were fairly modern, meaning they seldom changed physiologically from the time. The cetaceans diversified, and fossil evidence suggests porpoises and dolphins diverged from their last common ancestor around 15 Mya. The oldest fossils are known from <b>the</b> <b>shallow</b> seas around the North Pacific, with animals spreading to the European coasts and Southern Hemisphere only much later, during the Pliocene.|$|E

5|$|Sauropelta {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} known nodosaurids. All specimens of S. edwardsorum were recovered from the Little Sheep Mudstone section of the Cloverly Formation in Wyoming and Montana, which has been dated to 108.5 million years ago, during the Early Cretaceous. Sauropelta lived in wide floodplains around rivers that drained into <b>the</b> <b>shallow</b> inland sea to the north and east, carrying sediment eroded from the low mountains to the west. Periodic flooding of these rivers covered the surrounding plains with new muddy sediments, creating the Cloverly Formation and burying the remains of many animals, some of which would be fossilized. At the end of Cloverly times, <b>the</b> <b>shallow</b> sea would expand to cover the entire region and would eventually split North America completely in half, forming the Western Interior Seaway. Abundant fossil remains of coniferous trees suggest that these plains were covered in forests. Grasses would not evolve until later in the Cretaceous, so Sauropelta and other Early Cretaceous dinosaurian herbivores browsed from a variety of conifers and cycads. Nodosaurids like Sauropelta had narrow snouts, an adaptation seen today in animals that are selective browsers as opposed to the wide muzzles of grazers.|$|E
