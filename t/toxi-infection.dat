Staphylococci are pathogen bacteria and conditioned pathogen bacteria with a pronounced tropism for cutaneous tissue causing therefore infections at this level. Also they can invade other tissues and organs and can provoke septicaemias and food toxi-infections. Staphylococci food <b>toxi-infection</b> that refers this paper was track down during an epidemiologic investigation accomplished by Sălaj Sanitary-Veterinary and Food Safety Department (DSVSA) to a milk processing centre. Epidemiologic investigation carried out by DSVSA inspectors together with samples analyses made into microbiology laboratory by the same institution brought out that an employee was responsible of staphylococci infection. This person transmitted the staphylococci through palm teguments. Also the responsibility belongs to the supervisor that had not verified periodical medical analyses and had not observed the lack of theme.

40|$|Abstract. Salmonella {{is one of}} {{the major}} sources of <b>toxi-infection</b> in humans in France and United States. The {{incidence}} of human salmonellosis has considerably increased over the past 20 years and this can be largely attributed to epidemics of S. enteritidis phage type 4 in poultry in numerous countries. In this article, we formulate and analyse a model in which the transmission of the disease is determined by contact between hens and Salmonella in the environment...|$|E
40|$|International audienceis one of {{the major}} sources of <b>toxi-infection</b> in humans, most often because of {{consumption}} of poultry products. The main reason for this association is the presence in hen flocks of silent carriers, i. e. animals harbouring without expressing any visible symptoms. Many prophylactic means have been developed to reduce the prevalence of carrier-state. While none allows a total reduction of the risk, synergy could result in a drastic reduction of it. Evaluating the risk by modeling would be very useful to estimate such gain in food safety. Here, we propose an individual-based model which describes the spatio-temporal spread of within a laying flock and takes into account the host response to bacterial infection. The model includes the individual bacterial load and the animals' ability to reduce it thanks to the immune response, i. e. maximum bacterial dose that the animals may resist without long term carriage and, when carriers, length of bacterial clearance. For model validation, we simulated the spread under published experimental conditions. There was a good agreement between simulated and observed published data. This model will thus allow studying the effects, on the spatiotemporal distribution of the bacteria, of both mean and variability of different elements of host response...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{evaluate}} {{the public health}} impact of milk contamination in Bamako, Mali. METHODS A case-control study assessed the risk-factors for food-borne <b>toxi-infections</b> with diarrhoea and vomiting as main clinical picture. A total of 131 schoolchildren between 5 and 20 years of age were interviewed by trained interviewers in schools in Bamako. A structured questionnaire was used to record health problems, food and particularly milk consumption habits and socio-economic indicators. RESULTS Final {{multivariate logistic regression analysis}} identified regular consumption of boiled milk [odds ratio(OR) = 4. 38; 95 1. 15 - 16. 71], age between 5 and 10 years (OR vs. age group 11 - 15 years = 3. 28; 95 household (OR = 7. 65; 95 diarrhoea and vomiting. Other milk products and the socio-economic level of the household were not significantly associated with the outcome. Many people were unaware of the potential risks of milk consumption. CONCLUSIONS Milk products may be a risk factor for food-borne <b>toxi-infections.</b> Attention has to be paid to products considered `safe`, such as boiled or pasteurized milk. The low awareness of potential risks of many people may increase the risk of milk consumption. To achieve a sustainable increase in local milk production in Africa, milk quantity and production and transformation quality should be improved simultaneously...|$|R

40|$|Salmonella enterica {{subspecies}} enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) {{has been}} recently {{recognized as a}} prevalent cause of alimentary <b>toxi-infection</b> worldwide. Its widespread presence {{could be explained by}} intensification and globalization of traffic, global trade, and the rest of socioeconomic processes. However, no matter to global spreading of S. Enteritidis, there is unequal distribution of certain phage types (PT) where PT 4 and 8 are predominant. Salmonella is considered as a cause of various diseases from acute enterocolitis to typhoid fever. All bacteria from this species have numerous virulence factors such as: adhesins, toxins, virulence plasmids, and cell wall lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Similar to other salmonella serotypes, S. Enteritidis has a virulence plasmid. It allows a bacterium to persist inside the reticuloendothelial cells, while strains without it are eliminated quickly. In the last few years several virulent S. Enteritidis strains of PT 4 were described and considered to be of the same origin. The domination of PT 4 is probably subjected to the resistance of certain strains to nitrofurantoin which is used in poultry rising. The increased significance of S. Enteritidis refers not only to its association with pandemic problems but to frequent reports about extraintestinal infectious processes caused by this bacterium. Taking into consideration that eggs are very important source of infection besides poultry meat, the advised efficient preventive measures, among others, should be some changes in poultry meat preparation, investigation of outbreak-related flocks and devastation of infected ones, as well as egg pasteurization...|$|E
40|$|The Bacillus cereus group {{includes}} several species displaying distinct virulence spectra {{as diverse as}} mammal anthrax caused by Bacillus anthracis, food <b>toxi-infection</b> due to B. cereus or the entomopathogenic activity of Bacillus thuringiensis. Many of these differences are associated with Mobile Genetic Elements (MGE), including plasmids, insertion sequences or transposons. However, {{little is known about}} the potential contribution of MGE, and particularly phages, to the adaptation of the B. cereus group to diverse niches. Tectiviridae, one of the phage families preying on the B. cereus group, includes tail-less temperate bacteriophages where the dsDNA is located within a lipid-containing membrane, covered by an icosahedral protein capsid. For instance, GIL 01, GIL 16 and Bam 35 are tectiviruses infecting B. thuringiensis, while AP 50 has been reported to infect B. anthracis. Additionally, GIL 01, GIL 16 and Bam 35 exhibit a strong similarity to the B. cereus linear plasmid pBClin 15. Since these tectiviruses are able to reside as linear plasmid into their host cells, establishing long-term relationships, it is important to understand the selective pressures displayed by bacteria when facing these bacteriophages. Therefore, the aim of this work was to study the different bacterial resistance phenotypes shown against GIL 01 and GIL 16 tectiviruses. Several B. thuringiensis strains were subjected to a selection pressure after repeated propagation with GIL 01 and GIL 16 clear plaque (CP) mutants. These CP mutants elicited an elevated killing efficiency since they propagate exclusively lytically. Bacterial mutants, displaying complete resistance to the CP phages, were found at low frequency. They exhibited various colony morphotypes and showed distinct adaptation features, as illustrated by their biofilm formation and exopolysaccharide production, sporulation rate and long-term survival capacity. These observations indicate that phages can drive the ecological adaptation of the B. cereus group members. These results will shed new light on bacteriophages receptor(s) and on the bacterial adaptation strategies to virus life-styles...|$|E
40|$|Background: One of {{the most}} common {{pathogens}} causing alimentary <b>toxi-infections</b> is Staphylococcus aureus (S aureus). The presence of S aureus in food, indicates flaws during food manipulations. For this reason most sanitary norms require the detection of S aureus carriers. Aim: To determine the carriage rate of enterotoxin producing S aureus strains in food handlers, and to evaluate the antibiotic susceptibility to six antimicrobial agents. Materials and Methods: A total of 102 food handlers from 19 restaurants in Santiago, were analyzed. Samples for microbiological analysis were obtained with a swab from the retropharynx. Results: S aureus grew in 35 out of the 102 samples obtained (34 %). Further analysis revealed that 19 / 35 (54 %) strains were able to produce enterotoxins. Therefore the corrected carriage rate was 19 % (19 / 102). The most frequently detected enterotoxin was the type A (12 / 19). All S aureus isolates were resistant to penicillin and susceptible to oxacillin, clindamycin, kanamycin, vancomycin and linezolid. Conclusions: The carriage rate of S aureus in food handlers is similar to the rate reported in the general population in our country. These results confirm the need for education and training programs in food safety, directed to food handlers (Rev Méd Chile 2002; 130 : 859 - 64...|$|R
40|$|Animal Welfare (AW) {{issues are}} {{becoming}} an increasing concern for food-producing and laboratory animals. Risk Assessment (RA) is usually {{used to describe}} and quantify the risk of introduction of infections, <b>toxi-infections</b> or residues coming from veterinary medicines, by importing live animals and their products or to identify options for the control of epidemic or endemic diseases. Recently, RA methods have been sought {{to be applied to}} AW as well. However, considering that this is a newly emerging area, for which no general guidelines have been produced, the above mentioned RAs cannot be always directly transferred. The use of a RA approach to evaluate issues related to AW can be useful to better identify and rank welfare risk factors, and to prioritise possible management measures. Possible approaches to AW RA are described and differences and similarities with the classical RA are discussed as well as the problems identified concerning the use of RA methodology for AW. A significant difficulty in AW RA consists in the quantification of the severity and of the probability of exposure of the identified hazards to welfare. Furthermore, data from different expert opinions are not always expressed using the same scale. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has launched RA studies in which AW was considered as endpoint of interest. Examples are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSalmonella {{is one of}} {{the major}} sources of <b>toxi-infections</b> in humans. The {{association}} between egg consumption and Salmonella outbreaks is a serious economic and public health problem. To control the incidence of Salmonella in poultry flocks, many prophylactic means have been developed but none allows a total reduction of the risk. In a previous study, we derived mathematical models for Salmonella transmission and used them to appreciate the most important factors of variation of egg contamination rate and thus of risk of human contamination. Thanks to recent data of a selection experiment for increased or decreased rate of carrier-state (also called divergent selection), we showed that mixing, in an equal proportion, animals issued from a line selected for a lower (denoted Sal-) or higher propensity to carry Salmonella (denoted Sal+) results in a reduction by half of the maximal percentage of contaminated animals but does not accelerate the extinction of the disease. Vaccination and selection should be synergic, since a former contamination reduces the maximal prevalence by  45 and 71 %, respectively, in Sal+ or Sal- flocks respectively. These results show the interest in the introduction, even at a rather moderate percentage, of animals selected for a reduced rate of Salmonella carrier-state within commercial flocks. This could be achieved by using one or more selected lines in commercial crosses. These results must be confirmed experimentally while the mathematical model could be extended with minor modifications to other animal species or pathogenic species...|$|R
40|$|The Bacillus cereus group {{includes}} several species displaying distinct virulence spectra {{as diverse as}} mammal anthrax caused by Bacillus anthracis, food <b>toxi-infection</b> due to B. cereus or the entomopathogenic activity of Bacillus thuringiensis. Many of these differences are associated with Mobile Genetic Elements (MGE), including plasmids, insertion sequences or transposons and phages. Nevertheless, {{little is known about}} the potential contribution of MGE, and particularly phages, to the adaptation of the B. cereus group members to diverse ecological niches. One interesting phage family infecting the B. cereus group is Tectiviridae comprising non-enveloped tail-less phages with a double-layer capsid where the ~ 15 kb linear dsDNA is located within a lipid-containing membrane covered by a rigid icosahedral protein capsid. This family contains two groups of phages: the lytic PRD 1 infecting Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, and the temperate ones preying on Gram-positive bacteria belonging to the Bacillus cereus sensu lato (s. l.) group. Phages Bam 35 (or GIL 01), GIL 16 and AP 50 are representatives of the latter tectivirus group. Additionally, these phages exhibit a strong similarity to the B. cereus linear plasmid pBClin 15. Although the biology of PRD 1 is well studied, {{little is known about the}} interactions taking place between tectiviruses and their respective Gram-positive hosts. Therefore, this work aimed at characterizing the interactions between tectiviruses and their B. cereus s. l. host cells. Due to the fact that temperate tectiviruses are able to reside as linear plasmid, the occurrence of tectiviral elements was addressed among nearly 2, 000 B. cereus s. l. strains and very closely related bacteria isolated worldwide. PCR and propagation tests revealed that tectiviral elements occurred in less than 5 % of the examined strains. Despite this limited distribution, some novel tectivirus were found, and DNA sequencing of variable regions indicated that a greater diversity exist within the Tectiviridae. In an effort to assess the host range of GIL 01, GIL 16 and their new cousins, 100 strains of B. cereus s. l. devoid of tectiviral-like elements were tested. The results showed that ca. 30 % of the bacteria were sensitive to the tectiviruses tested. Interestingly, some strains were susceptible to both GIL 01 and GIL 16, whereas others could be infected only by one representative. These results strongly suggest that more than one molecule can act as tectivirus receptor on the bacterial surface. For studying adsorption properties and identification of tectivirus receptors, spontaneous as well as transposon-induced bacterial mutant libraries were obtained and mutants displaying either complete or specific phage resistances were obtained. Bacterial mutants displaying complete resistance to tectivirus exhibited various colony morphotypes and showed distinct adaptation features, as illustrated by their biofilm formation and exopolysaccharide production, changes in conjugation frequency of some B. thuringiensis plasmids, sporulation rate and long-term survival capacity. These observations indicate that tectiviruses may drive life-trait changes and ecological adaptations in the B. cereus group members. These results will shed new light on bacteriophages receptor(s) and on the bacterial adaptation strategies to phage life-styles...|$|E

40|$|In Senegal, the {{red meat}} is {{considered}} as a first choice food because of its nutritional value. Its value in proteins and its nature made it an indispensable food for a well-proportioned food intake. This sector of activity is very worthy and has permitted the development of others activities like butchering and restaurants commonly called 'dibiteries'. In these dibiteries, meat is served to clients after many manipulations and a wood fire grilling process. However, despites its nutritional qualities, this meat is a favorable environment of bacterial proliferation. People working in slaughter-houses and dibiteries ignored hygienic practices and so contributed to the dissemination and the multiplication of pathogen germs during the production and commercialization process and by affecting the microbiological quality of this meat. This contamination can cause alimentary <b>toxi-infections</b> to consumers. The general objective {{of this study is}} to analyze the contamination risks of small ruminants meat produced within slaughterhouses and sold in dibiteries of Dakar. To do so, risk analysis of contamination of the meat in slaughterhouses and dibiteries has been done following the OIE method. A transversal survey conducted in slaughterhouses, slaughter areas and dibiteries of Dakar has permitted to get informations about the quality of the meat from the slaughter to consumption. Questionnaires have been completed and samples of meat have been tested to evaluate the number of germs responsible of the contamination. Thereby, 138 samples of meat (crude and grilled) have been analyzed to search for fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, sulfite-reducing anaerobic agents and total aerobic mesophilic flora. The contamination in slaughterhouses and in slaughter areas has shown an acceptable level for faecal coliforms, E. coli and mesophilic flora but has been satisfactory for sulfite-reducing anaerobic agents and Staphylococcus. Concerning data collected from dibiteries, 20 / 40 are unsatisfactory for the fecal coliforms, 18 / 40 for E. coli and 20 / 40 for the mesophile flora. Sulfite-reducing anaerobic agents were to be neglected. The assessment of the risk has taken into account the factual paths integrating all kind of steps occurring in any bacterial contamination of the meat within slaughterhouses or felling areas, during the transportation, preparation within dibiteries and the consequences that result from that. So, three levels of risks for the consumers have been determined: (i) From enough high to very high (50. 52 %), (ii) From very weak to a bit high (48. 95 %) and (iii) Quasi-nil to extremely weak (0. 52 %) These results allowed us to formulate some prescriptions to the different actors for the improvement of the quality of meat produced within slaughterhouses and sold in dibiteries...|$|R
