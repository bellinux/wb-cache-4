5|$|Final Fantasy XIII: Episode I, a short novel set {{immediately}} after XIII, shows Lightning uneasy about whether her battle is over or not. She leaves to save Fang and Vanille, but first gives her blessing to Snow and Serah's marriage. Eventually, Lightning finds herself {{caught in a}} dark void, but she decides <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>moving</b> forward.|$|E
5|$|After {{building}} boats, Lochry {{and his men}} set {{off from}} Wheeling, hoping {{to catch up with}} the main body of the expedition. Meanwhile, Clark left Major Charles Cracraft with provisions and a small group of men on Camp Three Island to await Lochry's arrival. Further down the Ohio, Clark stopped at the mouth of the Kanawha River, but again he decided <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>moving</b> in order to prevent desertion. Clark left a letter fastened to a pole which instructed Lochry to keep following.|$|E
5|$|In {{his search}} for the lime, Scott discovers a strange, {{swirling}} cloud of dust that absorbs moisture. He follows it until he collapses {{in front of a}} lake bed. He has a brief hallucination where he engages in a spiritual conversation with a priest he knew on Earth. Meanwhile, the cloud moves up to him and condenses into water, waking him. Realizing what he's found, Scott shovels as much of the lime as possible into his bag and makes his way to the Gate. Greer, having set out to look for him, finds him along the way and helps carry the lime. Wallace sticks his arm into the wormhole to delay the countdown. The team returns with the lime successfully, which is used to repair the CO2 scrubbers. In the end, a recovering Scott tells Chloe that his parents and the priest died when he was young, and {{that the best way to}} deal with the grief is <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>moving</b> forward. As everyone starts to breathe easier, a ship detaches itself from the Destiny.|$|E

25|$|Each soldier had {{two to four}} horses—so when a horse tired {{they could}} change {{to one of the}} others. This made them one of the fastest armies in the world, but also made the Mongol army {{vulnerable}} to shortages of fodder. Campaigning in arid regions such as Central Asia or forested regions of Southern China were thus difficult and even in ideal steppe terrain, a Mongol force had <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>moving</b> to ensure sufficient grazing for its massive horse herd.|$|E
25|$|Two forts on the Outer Banks (Fort Clark and Fort Hatteras) {{had been}} built by the Confederates, to protect their commerce-raiding activity. But these were lightly-defended, and their {{artillery}} could not engage the bombarding fleet under Flag Officer Silas H. Stringham, commandant of the Atlantic Blockading Squadron, which had been ordered <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>moving,</b> to avoid presenting a static target. Although held up by bad weather, the fleet was able to land troops under General Ben Butler, who took the surrender of Flag Officer Samuel Barron.|$|E
25|$|Combat in Mass Effect: Andromeda {{takes place}} in real-time, and unlike {{previous}} installments in the series, pausing the game to aim or use skills from a menu {{is no longer a}} feature. During action sequences, the player has direct control of Ryder from an over-the-shoulder perspective, who can move around the battlefield in a variety of ways, including a side-to-side dash or vertical leap into the air using a jetpack. When the player approaches an object, Ryder will automatically take cover, providing the player with protection in battle. The game encourages players <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>moving</b> during combat with large, open battlefields and enemies that attack from all angles, but also allows for both aggressive and defensive strategies.|$|E

25|$|The fleet {{moved to}} the attack on November 7, after more delays caused by the weather during which {{additional}} troops were brought into Fort Walker. Flag Officer Du Pont ordered his ships <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>moving</b> in an elliptical path, bombarding Fort Walker on one leg and Fort Beauregard on the other; the tactic had recently been used effectively at the Battle of Hatteras Inlet. His plan soon broke down, however, and most ships took enfilading positions that exploited a weakness in Fort Walker. The Confederate gunboats put in a token appearance, but fled up a nearby creek when challenged. Early in the afternoon, most of the guns in the fort were out of action, and the soldiers manning them fled to the rear. A landing party from the flagship took possession of the fort.|$|E
25|$|Network Projection is used {{to detect}} and use network-connected projectors. It {{can be used to}} display a {{presentation}}, or share a presentation with the machine which hosts the projector. Users can do this over a network so multiple sources can be connected at different times without having <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>moving</b> the sources or projectors around. The network projector can be connected to the network via wireless or cable (LAN) technology to make it even more flexible. Users can not only connect to the network projector remotely but can also remotely configure it. Network projectors are designed to transmit and display still images, such as photographs and slides —not high-bandwidth transmissions, such as video streams. The projector can transmit video, but the playback quality is often poor. Binary %windir%\system32\NetProj.exe implement Network Projection feature.|$|E
25|$|Richthofen's forces quickly {{established}} {{air superiority}} in the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula, destroying 82 enemy fighters {{within the first}} day. Richthofen arrived at his command post as the bombs first fell. He {{was impressed with the}} 2,100 sorties flown on 7 May. Inter service communication was facilitated by Fliegerverbindungsoffizier (air liaison officers or Flivos), specially trained air force officers attached to ground units. They advised the air Corps on the situation and intentions of the ground forces and also advised the army of the best use of air power. This operational style was effective against fixed targets in slow-moving operations, but was more difficult in fast-moving operations such as Bustard Hunt. The advance meant Richthofen had <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>moving</b> forward. He complained bitterly about the inability of his signals teams to set up new telephone and radio communications quickly enough.|$|E

25|$|Kōsuke Fujishima's manga series Ah! My Goddess {{featured}} {{a play on}} Schrödinger's Cat. During one storyline, a storage room was expanded to infinite proportions and the main characters encountered a Schrödinger's Whale, an extremely rare species {{with the ability to}} travel through space-time in a five-dimensional quantum state. The male lead in the series, Keiichi Morisato, befriends the whale and teaches it songs by real-life musical group The Carpenters (in the original English translation, it was Matthew Sweet) - but their time spent together is short, for the whale must move on or risk its safety as its wave function collapses. Because of this need <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>moving</b> through quantum states, Schrödinger's Whales hardly ever meet, the reason they are so thin on the ground— but miraculously, Keiichi secured the future of the species by teaching it the songs. After discovering the whale had gone, he found out that it had learned Only Yesterday by itself (Missing Time in the translation) - this gave the whales a call that they could locate each other by.|$|E
25|$|Zaken, in {{the second}} tank, tried to reach his company commanders on the radio, but got no reply. He called the crewmen and told and learned {{that many of the}} commanders were either dead or wounded. He told them <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>moving</b> {{to get out of the}} ambush and fire all weapons. The {{battalion}} made it to the square at the end of the streets and lined up facing the sources of fire. One tank commander Captain Menashe Goldblatt, who had been hit in the shoulder and lost his consciousness, recovered and was asked by Zaken to go from tank to tank and talk to the crews. He found that many of the commanders were either dead or wounded, and that many of the men were in shock. He appointed gunners and loaders as tank commanders, assigned them fire sectors and told them to switch their radio frequency from the company frequency to the battalion frequency so that they could speak directly to Zaken. One tank commander was not wounded but refused to take his head out of the turret and Goldblatt warned him that he would personally fire a shell at him if he didn't start functioning.|$|E
25|$|A light sail or {{magnetic}} sail {{powered by}} a massive laser or particle accelerator in the home star system could potentially reach even greater speeds than rocket- or pulse propulsion methods, because it would not need to carry its own reaction mass and therefore would only need to accelerate the craft's payload. Robert L. Forward proposed a means for decelerating an interstellar light sail in the destination star system without requiring a laser array {{to be present in}} that system. In this scheme, a smaller secondary sail is deployed {{to the rear of the}} spacecraft, whereas the large primary sail is detached from the craft <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>moving</b> forward on its own. Light is reflected from the large primary sail to the secondary sail, which is used to decelerate the secondary sail and the spacecraft payload. In 2002, Geoffrey A. Landis of NASA's Glen Research center also proposed a laser-powered, propulsion, sail ship that would host a diamond sail (of a few nanometers thick) powered with the use of solar energy. With this proposal, this interstellar ship would, theoretically, be able to reach 10 percent the speed of light.|$|E

25|$|The battle {{took place}} {{less than a}} month after Britain's {{declaration}} of war against Germany on 5 August 1914. Initially, the war on land went badly for the French and their allies, with German forces invading France and an urgent need to gather all possible troops to send to France to resist them. The British government was in a position of having nothing but bad news, and looked to the navy, the largest in the world and traditionally the mainstay of British military power, for some success to report. British naval tactics had typically involved a close blockade of enemy ports, taking the fight to the enemy, and this had been the British plan for war against Germany up to 1913. Such an approach was still expected by the British population. However, it was realised that the advent of submarines armed with torpedoes and mines hidden in open sea meant that any operations involving stationing capital ships near enemy ports would place them at great risk of surprise attack and loss. Then, there was the issue of fuel: powered ships, obliged <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>moving</b> to reduce their vulnerability as sitting targets, were continuously using fuel and had to return to port every few days.|$|E
25|$|However, as the English forces encircled Snowdonia and {{his people}} starved he was soon moving desperately from one fort to another as {{effective}} resistance was systematically crushed. Dolwyddelan, which was at risk of becoming encircled, was first abandoned on 18 January 1283. After this Dolbadarn Castle served as his base but by March this noble site {{in the heart of}} Snowdonia was also threatened forcing his departure. Finally, Dafydd moved his headquarters south to Castell y Bere near Llanfihangel-y-pennant. As the situation deteriorated it seems most likely that Dafydd and his family hoped to remain at Y Bere just long enough to avoid the worst of the Welsh winter before they were compelled to evacuate the site at the end of March in advance of the English forces who were manoeuvering to place it under siege. From this point forwards the prince, his family and the remains of his government were fugitives sleeping outdoors, forced <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>moving</b> from place to place to avoid capture. Castell Y Bere's starving garrison would eventually surrender on 25 April. After the fall of Y Bere, Dafydd's movements are speculative but he is recorded in May 1283 leading raids from the mountains supported to the bitter end by Goronwy ap Heilin, Hywel ap Rhys and his brother Rhys Wyndod.|$|E
25|$|Lü Meng {{rejected}} the coins and gold, but Sun Quan {{insisted that he}} accept. He became ill again before he was enfeoffed as a marquis. Sun Quan was at Gong'an County then so he had Lü Meng brought to his personal residence to stay with him. He also offered 1,000 jin of gold as a reward to any person who could cure Lü Meng. Sun Quan became more worried as Lü Meng's condition deteriorated over time. He wanted to see Lü Meng but {{felt that it was}} too troublesome <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>moving</b> around, so he had a hole drilled in the wall to observe Lü Meng's room. He was happy when he saw Lü Meng having his meals, but could not sleep at night when he saw that Lü Meng did not eat anything. When Lü Meng's condition improved slightly, he was so happy that he ordered his subjects to visit Lü Meng and wish him well. He even invited Taoist priests to perform rituals to increase Lü Meng's lifespan. Despite Sun Quan's efforts, Lü Meng eventually died in Gong'an County at the age of 42 (by East Asian age reckoning). Sun Quan was extremely grieved by Lü Meng's death. Before Lü Meng died, he had instructed his family to store all their priced possessions – including gifts from Sun Quan – in a vault and return them to his lord after his death. He had also asked for a simple funeral. Sun Quan felt even more sad when found out that Lü Meng had made such arrangements before his death.|$|E
