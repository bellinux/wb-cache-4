5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} {{is closely related}} to the water pipit and <b>the</b> <b>meadow</b> pipit, and is rather similar in appearance. Compared to <b>the</b> <b>meadow</b> pipit, the Eurasian rock pipit is darker, larger and longer-winged than its relative, and has dark, rather than pinkish-red, legs. The water pipit in winter plumage is also confusable with the Eurasian rock pipit, but has a strong {{supercilium}} and greyer upperparts; it is also typically much warier. The Eurasian rock pipit's dusky, rather than white, outer tail feathers are also a distinction from all its relatives. The habitats used by Eurasian rock and water pipits are completely separate in the breeding season, and there is little overlap even when birds are not nesting.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian rock pipit's song is a {{sequence}} of about twenty tinkling cheepa notes followed by a rising series of thin gee calls, and finishing with a short trill. The shrill pseep flight call is intermediate between the soft sip sip sip of <b>the</b> <b>meadow</b> pipit and the water pipit's short, thin fist.|$|E

5|$|The {{agriculture}} of {{the parish}} is chiefly confined to grazing, and would be more materially benefited by draining; but the tax upon brick, a most essential article in this process, {{has been a very}} great hindrance to it. The use of lime—imported from Wales, and brought by the inland navigations to the neighbourhood of our collieries—has become very general in the improvement of <b>the</b> <b>meadow</b> and pasture lands.|$|E
5|$|The {{water pipit}} {{is closely related}} to the Eurasian rock pipit and <b>the</b> <b>meadow</b> pipit, and is rather similar to both in appearance. Compared to <b>the</b> <b>meadow</b> pipit, the water pipit is longer-winged and longer-tailed than its relative, and has much paler underparts. It has dark, rather than pinkish-red, legs. The water pipit in winter plumage is also confusable with the Eurasian rock pipit, but has a strong supercilium, greyer upperparts, and white, not grey, outer tail feathers; it is also {{typically}} much warier. The habitats used by Eurasian rock and water pipits are completely separate in the breeding season, and there is little overlap even when birds are not nesting. There is also little mixing with breeding meadow pipits, although since 1960 some overlapping territories have been found where the species coexist.|$|E
5|$|The water pipit's song is {{delivered}} from a perch or in flight, {{and consists of}} four or five blocks, each consisting of about half a dozen repetitions of a different short note. In comparison, the Eurasian rock pipit's song is a sequence of about twenty tinkling cheepa notes followed by a rising series of thin gee calls, and finishing with a short trill. The call of the water pipit is a single or double sharp “dzip” or similar, slightly harsher than soft sip sip sip of <b>the</b> <b>meadow</b> pipit or the shrill pseep of the Eurasian rock pipit. The short, thin fist flight call is intermediate between the sip of <b>the</b> <b>meadow</b> pipit and the rock pipit's feest. The differences between the calls of the pipit species are very subtle, and not diagnostic in the absence of other evidence. The flight call of the subspecies A. s. coutellii is shorter and more buzzing than that of the nominate race.|$|E

The fighting climaxed with the tower losing its magical properties and bursting into flames. In another spectacle, singing sirens swam past the king, and Neptune floated by in a chariot drawn by seahorses.|$|E
5|$|In autumn and winter, the {{extensive}} flood plain of the Shannon Callows supports {{a large number}} of waders, swans, wildfowl and other bird life. The most obvious of all Shannon birds is the mute swan. Also seen are the coot, moorhen and little grebe (or dabchick). The kingfisher is widespread as are <b>the</b> <b>meadow</b> pipit and pied wagtail.

5|$|In the {{northern}} part of its range, the species often occurs with <b>the</b> <b>meadow</b> vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus), but no evidence shows they compete with each other. In the south, the hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) and the rice rat regularly occur together; water levels are known to influence relative abundance of these two species in Florida. The cotton rat is mainly active during the day, which may help differentiate its niche from that of the rice rat.|$|E

The couple had three sons – Hugh, Matt and Charlie; Charlie became a successful event rider. Matt and Hugh had a career in auto racing.|$|E
5|$|The family Motacillidae {{consists}} of the wagtails, pipits and longclaws. The largest {{of the three groups}} is the pipits in the genus Anthus, which are typically brown-plumaged terrestrial insectivores. Their similar appearances have led to taxonomic problems; the water pipit and the buff-bellied pipit were both formerly considered subspecies of the Eurasian rock pipit. Of these, the rock pipit is the more closely related to the water pipit, based on external and molecular characteristics. Other near relatives are <b>the</b> <b>meadow,</b> red-throated and rosy pipits.|$|E

5|$|Bambi is a {{roe deer}} fawn {{born in a}} thicket to a young doe in late spring one year. Over {{the course of the}} summer, his mother teaches him about the various {{inhabitants}} of the forest and the ways deer live. When she feels he is old enough, she takes him to <b>the</b> <b>meadow</b> which he learns is both a wonderful but also dangerous place as it leaves the deer exposed and in the open. After some initial fear over his mother's caution, Bambi enjoys the experience. On a subsequent trip, Bambi meets his Aunt Ena, and her twin fawns Faline and Gobo. They quickly become friends and share what they have learned about the forest. While they are playing, they encounter princes, male deer, for the first time. After the stags leave, the fawns learn that those were their fathers, but that the fathers rarely stay with or speak to the females and young.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eastern}} Baltic region of Livonia, people {{designated}} as werewolves went underground {{in the shape}} of dogs to fight against sorcerers who stole the shoots of the grain. If the werewolves failed to wrest the shoots, there would be famine. In Romania, strigoi were people born with a caul, which they donned upon reaching adulthood; this made them invisible. They then travelled in animal form to <b>the</b> <b>meadow</b> {{at the end of the}} world. There they fought each other all night, becoming reconciled in the morning. The reason for the fight is not specified. The Circassians told that, on a certain night of the year, their sorcerers fought with the sorcerers of the Abkhaz people, trying to suck each other's blood.|$|E

5|$|The {{club was}} founded in March 1886 {{in an area of}} south Belfast known as Sandy Row by workers at the Ulster Spinning Company's Linfield Mill. Originally known as Linfield Athletic Club, the team played on ground {{at the back of the}} mill known as <b>the</b> <b>Meadow.</b> However, success on the field meant that the club had to {{accommodate}} bigger crowds, so this brought about a move to Ulsterville Avenue in 1889. In 1890, Bob Milne signed for the club from the Gordon Highlanders. The Scot would soon become a key member of the team, helping the Blues to lift the Irish Cup at the young age of 20. The club stayed at Ulsterville for five years before housing development on the ground in 1894 meant that the club had to move on once again. Between 1894 and 1897, Linfield played all of their home games at opponents' grounds until the president of the club, Robert Gibson – who had donated the Gibson Cup trophy to the Irish League for the championship – along with other club members eventually secured a ground lease at Myrtlefield in the Balmoral area of the city.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebee {{species are}} declining in Europe, North America, and Asia {{due to a}} number of factors, {{including}} land-use change that reduces their food plants. In North America, pathogens are possibly having a stronger negative effect especially for the subgenus Bombus. A major impact on bumblebees was caused by the mechanisation of agriculture, accelerated by the urgent need to increase food production during the Second World War. Small farms depended on horses to pull implements and carts. The horses were fed on clover and hay, both of which were permanently grown on a typical farm. Little artificial fertiliser was used. Farms thus provided flowering clover and flower-rich meadows, favouring bumblebees. Mechanisation removed the need for horses and most of the clover; artificial fertilisers encouraged the growth of taller grasses, outcompeting <b>the</b> <b>meadow</b> flowers. Most of the flowers, and the bumblebees that fed on them, disappeared from Britain by the early 1980s. The last native British short-haired bumblebee was captured near Dungeness in 1988. This significant increase in pesticide and fertilizer use associated with the industrialization of agriculture has had adverse effects on the Bombus genus. The bees are directly exposed to the chemicals in two ways: by consuming nectar that has been directly treated with pesticide, or through physical contact with treated plants and flowers. The species Bombus hortorum in particular {{has been found to be}} impacted by the pesticides; their brood development has been reduced and their memory has been negatively affected. Additionally, pesticide use negatively impacts colony development and size.|$|E
