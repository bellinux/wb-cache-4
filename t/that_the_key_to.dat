5|$|Gandhi based Satyagraha on the Vedantic {{ideal of}} self-realization, ahimsa (nonviolence), vegetarianism, and {{universal}} love. William Borman states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> his satyagraha {{is rooted in}} the Hindu Upanishadic texts. According to Indira Carr, Gandhi's ideas on ahimsa and satyagraha were founded on the philosophical foundations of Advaita Vedanta. I. Bruce Watson states that some of these ideas are found not only in traditions within Hinduism, but also in Jainism or Buddhism, particularly those about non-violence, vegetarianism and universal love, but Gandhi's synthesis was to politicise these ideas. Gandhi's concept of satya as a civil movement, states Glyn Richards, are best understood {{in the context of the}} Hindu terminology of Dharma and Ṛta.|$|E

A 2007 study saw inflammatory lesions reduced by 39 percent in subjects using a combination of butenafine and benzoyl peroxide, compared with 34 percent in those using Proactiv containing only benzoyl peroxide.

5|$|On July 4, David {{demonstrates}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> {{defeating the}} aliens lies in deactivating their force fields, and devises {{a way to}} do so by uploading a computer virus into the mothership. He proposes using the refurbished alien fighter to implement the plan, which Steven volunteers to pilot. The two are able to upload the virus and deploy a nuclear weapon on board the mothership. With military pilots in short supply, Thomas enlists the help of volunteers with flight experience, including Russell, and leads an attack on a saucer bearing down on Area 51. With the aliens' shields deactivated, the fighters are able to inflict damage, but their supply of missiles is quickly exhausted. As the saucer prepares to fire on the base, Russell has one last missile to spare, but his attempt of firing it jams, leaving him no choice but to sacrifice his own life. He flies his plane kamikaze-style into the directed-energy weapon port, which results in an explosion that destroys the saucer. Human resistance forces around the world successfully destroy the other saucers using this vulnerability. As humankind is rejoicing in victory, Steven and David return to Area 51 unharmed and reunite with their families. They and military officers nearby accompany Thomas and his daughter in watching the wreckage from the mothership burn up, resembling a fireworks display as it enters Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

Half the participants heard the fake psychic suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> continued <b>to</b> bend after it had been put down on a table and half did not. Additionally, participants were exposed to either a negative social influence (a stooge co-witness reporting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> did not continue to bend), no social influence, or a positive social influence (a stooge co-witness reporting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> did continue <b>to</b> bend). Participants {{who were exposed to}} the verbal suggestion were significantly more likely <b>to</b> report <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> continued <b>to</b> bend. Additionally, more participants reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> continued <b>to</b> bend in the positive social influence condition compared to the other two social influence conditions.

5|$|On {{his arrival}} in Cairo, Clarke began to build a network of useful contacts. He befriended Lieutenant-Colonel Raymund Maunsell, who {{operated}} Security Intelligence Middle East (SIME), the agency in charge of counter-espionage in the region. Maunsell later worked closely with Clarke, helping to feed misinformation to the enemy via double agents. Clarke's first deception was a scheme to mislead Italian forces into expecting an invasion of Italian Somaliland instead of Eritrea, the real Allied target. Operation Camilla fooled the Italian leadership completely but instead of diverting troops as the British hoped, they withdrew their forces into Eritrea. From this failure Clarke learned a first lesson, one he would teach to many other deception officers during the war: <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> deception was not to make your enemy think what you wish but {{to get them to}} do what you want.|$|E
5|$|One {{early and}} {{influential}} theory of scientific explanation is the deductive-nomological model. It {{says that a}} successful scientific explanation must deduce the occurrence of the phenomena in question from a scientific law. This view {{has been subjected to}} substantial criticism, resulting in several widely acknowledged counterexamples to the theory. It is especially challenging to characterize what is meant by an explanation when the thing to be explained cannot be deduced from any law because {{it is a matter of}} chance, or otherwise cannot be perfectly predicted from what is known. Wesley Salmon developed a model in which a good scientific explanation must be statistically relevant to the outcome to be explained. Others have argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> a good explanation is unifying disparate phenomena or providing a causal mechanism.|$|E
5|$|The UN counterattack at Inchon {{collapsed}} the North Korean {{line and}} forced {{them back on}} all fronts. On 16 September, however, 25th Infantry Division was still fighting North Korean forces behind its lines, and North Korean strong points existed on the heights of Battle Mountain, P'il-bong, and Sobuk-san. Kean felt that the division could advance along the roads toward Chinju only when the mountainous center of the division front was clear. He therefore believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> the advance of the 25th Division lay in its center where the North Koreans held the heights and kept the 24th Infantry Regiment under daily attack. The 27th Infantry {{on the left and}} the 35th Infantry on the right, astride the roads between Chinju and Masan held their positions and could not advance until the situation in front of the 24th Infantry improved.|$|E

50|$|A 2007 {{study by}} National Center for Policy Analysis {{outlined}} {{a case for}} improved healthcare quality and lower cost resulting from increased patient consumerism. <b>The</b> study found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> <b>to</b> realizing <b>the</b> value of consumerism are two-fold. First, patients need to act as consumers since they are paying a larger out-of-pocket proportion of their healthcare. Second, consumers must have access to pricing information from providers before the service is rendered.|$|R
5|$|The {{understanding}} of thermodynamics was limited {{at the start}} of the 19th century, when it was believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> the successful storage to ice was the construction of underground ice houses, where it was believed, incorrectly, that it would always be cool enough to store ice successfully. European ice houses were based on this theory, and used underground chambers, often built at considerable expense, to store the winter harvest. Some farmers in Virginia, however, had developed much cheaper icehouses, elevated off the ground, built from wood and insulated with hay. In addition to the temperature that ice was held at, there was also a need to efficiently drain off the melted water, as this water would further melt the remaining ice much faster than warm air would do.|$|E

Ultimately, according to the job-based theories, the key to finding motivation through one's job is being able to derive satisfaction from the job content.|$|E

25|$|The Duke of Lerma (and to a {{large extent}} Philip II) had been uninterested in the affairs of their ally, Austria. In 1618, the king {{replaced}} him with Don Baltasar de Zúñiga, a veteran ambassador to Vienna. Don Balthasar believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> restraining the resurgent French and eliminating the Dutch was a closer alliance with Habsburg Austria. In 1618, beginning with the Defenestration of Prague, Austria and the Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand II, embarked on a campaign against the Protestant Union and Bohemia.

25|$|Internal politics, {{diplomacy}} and leadership also key factors in military evolution. Some scholars maintain <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> understanding African warfare {{lies in the}} political institutions and processes of the African landscape, where a massive number of small polities greatly outnumbered large empires or nations. The consolidation of these small polities into larger units sparked a growth in mass-recruited armies, a development that was more decisive overall than the appearance of gunpowder weapons. The Asante for example rose to power first through larger mass armies equipped with traditional bows, arrows and spears. Firearms were only to come later, after the crucial formative period. The key driver {{in the development of}} African military systems is thus the internal dynamics of particular indigenous states or kingdoms. The deployment of technology was ultimately shaped in this context.|$|E
25|$|While most big cat {{species are}} individual, ambush predators, Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) are pursuit predators. Widely {{known as the}} fastest {{terrestrial}} animal, with speeds reaching 61–64 miles per hour, cheetahs {{take advantage of their}} speed during chases. However, their speed and acceleration also have disadvantages, as both can only be sustained for short periods of time. Studies show that cheetahs can maintain maximum speed for a distance of approximately 500 yards. Due to these limitations, cheetahs are often observed running at moderate speeds during chases. There are claims <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> cheetahs' pursuit success may not be just their speed. Cheetahs are extremely agile, able to maneuver and change directions at very high speeds in very short amounts of time. This extensive maneuverability can make up for unsustainable high speed pursuit, as it allows cheetahs to quickly close the distance between prey without decreasing their speed when prey change direction.|$|E
