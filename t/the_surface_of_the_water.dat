5|$|Arctic terns {{sometimes}} dip down to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> {{to catch}} prey {{close to the}} surface. They may also chase insects in the air when breeding. It is also thought that Arctic terns may, {{in spite of their}} small size, occasionally engage in kleptoparasitism by swooping at birds so as to startle them into releasing their catches. Several species are targeted—conspecifics, other terns (like the common tern), and some auk and grebe species.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Dal Sasso et al.. {{reported}} {{the results of}} X-ray computed tomography of the MSNM V4047 snout. As the foramina on the outside all communicated with a space {{on the inside of}} the snout, the authors speculated that Spinosaurus had pressure receptors inside the space that allowed it to hold its snout at <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> to detect swimming prey species without seeing them.|$|E
5|$|Open {{water is}} {{unrestricted}} water {{such as a}} sea, lake or flooded quarry, where the diver has direct vertical access to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> {{in contact with the}} atmosphere. Open water diving implies that if a problem arises, the diver can directly ascend vertically to the atmosphere to breathe air.|$|E
40|$|A {{sharp edge}} is formed on an optical device {{by placing the}} optical device in a holding mechanism; {{grinding}} one surface so that it and a <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holding mechanism are co-planar; and polishing both <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optical device and <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holding mechanism with felt until an edge on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optical device adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holding mechanism obtains a desired sharpness...|$|R
40|$|An {{article is}} welded, as in weld repair of a defect, by {{positioning}} a weld lift-off block {{at a location}} on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article adjacent to <b>the</b> intended location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weldment on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article. The weld lift-off block has a wedge shape including a base contacting <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article, and an upper face angled upwardly from the base from a base leading edge. A weld pool is formed on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article by directly heating <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article using a heat source. The heat source is moved relative to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article and onto <b>the</b> upper <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weld lift-off block by crossing <b>the</b> leading edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wedge, without discontinuing <b>the</b> direct heating <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article by the heat source. <b>The</b> heating <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article with the heat source is discontinued only after the heat source is directly heating <b>the</b> upper face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weld lift-off block, and not the article...|$|R
40|$|To enhance <b>the</b> staying quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> copperplate, {{the laser}} hybrid {{cladding}} {{technology can be}} used to clad Ni-Cr alloy on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> copperplate. By the traditional laser cladding technology, it is hard to directly form good coat on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> copperplate. In the article, the coat is made on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> copperplate by the laser hybrid cladding technology, and the staying quality tests are made for samples by several methods, and the micro-hardness and <b>the</b> staying quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coat are far higher than the cooper substrate, and coat has good roughness <b>of</b> <b>surface.</b> And <b>the</b> test result indicates that the method adopting the laser hybrid cladding technology can prepare the alloy coat on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deep copperplate...|$|R
5|$|Since cats lack lips {{to create}} suction, {{they use a}} lapping method with the tongue to draw liquid upwards into their mouths. Lapping {{at a rate of}} four times a second, the cat touches the smooth tip of its tongue to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> and quickly retracts it, drawing water upwards.|$|E
5|$|The {{painted turtle}} hunts along water bottoms. It quickly juts its head {{into and out}} of {{vegetation}} to stir potential victims out into the open water, where they are pursued. The turtle holds large prey in its mouth and tears the prey apart with its forefeet. It also consumes plants and skims <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> with its mouth open to catch small particles of food.|$|E
5|$|Because {{its feet}} are located so far {{back on its}} body, the red-throated loon is quite clumsy walking on land, but it can use its feet to shove itself forward on its breast. Young use this method of {{covering}} ground when moving from their breeding pools to larger bodies of water, including rivers and the sea. It is the only species of loon able to take off directly from land. If frightened, it may submerge until only its head or bill shows above <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> spread <b>of</b> a {{malignancy}} into {{body cavities}} can occur via penetrating <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peritoneal, pleural, pericardial, or subarachnoid spaces. For example, ovarian tumors can spread transperitoneally to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liver.|$|R
30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, TBA is adsorbed onto <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electrode {{before the}} PEC oxidation starts, and therefore, the instantaneous photocurrent values could reflect the adsorption and degradation behavior on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electrode.|$|R
50|$|Electrocardiography (ECG or EKG) records <b>the</b> {{electrical}} activity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart, across <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thorax skin. The signals are detected by electrodes attached to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skin and recorded by a device {{external to the}} body.|$|R
5|$|Cockroaches {{are among}} the fastest insect runners and, at full speed, adopt a bipedal run to reach a high {{velocity}} in proportion to their body size. As cockroaches move very quickly, {{they need to be}} video recorded at several hundred frames per second to reveal their gait. More sedate locomotion is seen in the stick insects or walking sticks (Phasmatodea). A few insects have evolved to walk on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> especially members of the Gerridae family, commonly known as water striders. A few species of ocean-skaters in the genus Halobates even live on the surface of open oceans, a habitat that has few insect species.|$|E
5|$|In {{traditional}} tales {{the blue}} men {{have the power}} to create severe storms, but when the weather is fine they sleep or float just under <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> They swim with their torso from the waist upwards raised out of the sea, twisting and diving in a similar way to a porpoise. To amuse themselves the creatures play shinty when the skies are clear and bright at night. They are able to speak and converse with mariners and are especially vocal when soaking vessels with water spray, roaring with laughter as vessels capsize.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary role}} of the goalkeeper is to block shots at the goal. After saving the ball, the goalkeeper has the {{responsibility}} to keep possession of the ball {{in order to stop}} opposing players regaining possession. They must make sure that whenever the opposition appears to be ready to make a shot on goal, their hands are near or above <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> They also possess the job to pass down the pool accurately in order to retain possession of the ball, often starting the team's counterattack.|$|E
50|$|Equation (3.3) is not {{strictly}} correct, since the tangential electric field is zero only on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PEC scatterers. This inexactness {{will be resolved}} presently when we test with the current basis functions, defined as residing on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scatterer.|$|R
50|$|A Moon landing is <b>the</b> arrival <b>of</b> a {{spacecraft}} on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon. This includes both manned and unmanned (robotic) missions. The first human-made object to reach <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon was the Soviet Union's Luna 2 mission, on 13 September 1959.|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} {{applying}} a physical barrier to suppress thermal decomposition near a <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> a thermoelectric material including applying a continuous metal foil to a predetermined portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thermoelectric material, physically binding the continuous metal foil to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thermoelectric material using a binding member, and heating in a predetermined atmosphere the applied and physically bound continuous metal foil and the thermoelectric material to a sufficient temperature {{in order to}} promote bonding between the continuous metal foil and <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thermoelectric material. The continuous metal foil forms a physical barrier to enclose a predetermined portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> Thermal decomposition is suppressed at <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thermoelectric material enclosed by the physical barrier when the thermoelectric element is in operation...|$|R
5|$|The red-legged running frog (Kassina maculata) has short, slim hind limbs unsuited to jumping. It {{can move}} fast {{by using a}} running gait {{in which the two}} hind legs are used alternately. Slow-motion {{photography}} shows, unlike a horse that can trot or gallop, the frog's gait remained similar at slow, medium, and fast speeds. This species can also climb trees and shrubs, and does so at night to catch insects. The Indian skipper frog (Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis) has broad feet and can run across <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> for several metres (yards).|$|E
5|$|To {{strengthen}} the defence further, by 1881, mines were {{laid in the}} waters between the two forts and the eastern entrance of the harbour. The mines were tethered to the seabed but floated dangerously under <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> unseen to any enemy marine vessels. To enable safe passage of ships, a 'friendly safe channel' was created through the minefields. The work involved in the laying of minefields under the narrow channel (just 240 m apart) had actually led to rumours that tunnels running under the channels were constructed to link the two forts. There are, however, no archival records to prove that these tunnels were ever constructed.|$|E
5|$|When diving, {{this bird}} pulls its {{head back and}} then arches it forward into the water, with the body {{following}} and a slight springing. The legs only start moving when they are underwater. When swimming on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> the body of this grebe is relatively high, although none of the underparts are seen. The neck is held straight up in a relaxed manner, with the bill being held forward and parallel to the water. Each of the feet perform strong alternating strokes.|$|E
50|$|A {{ground track}} or ground trace is <b>the</b> path on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth {{directly}} below an aircraft or satellite. In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> a satellite, it is <b>the</b> projection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> satellite's orbit onto <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth (or whatever body the satellite is orbiting).|$|R
30|$|A third {{strategy}} is to locate the Au NPs on <b>the</b> outer <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liposomes. The particles are either tethered to <b>the</b> outer <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liposomes or directly deposited on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liposomes <b>surface</b> by lipid vesicle metallization process. On the deposited Au NPs, a gold shell can be further grown.|$|R
40|$|On <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> (5) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> floor {{covering}} micro-craters (6) statistically distributed {{are produced by}} <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> laser impulses, which are invisible to the human eye and have a suction pad effect. In a second process stage, <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thus produced laser-structured {{floor covering}} is subjected to a hydro-mechanical post-treatment. The hydro-mechanical post-treatment is only carried out in <b>the</b> cavities (6) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> floor covering or plates. This treatment is so effected that <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laser-structured floor covering is at least twice sprayed with fluid, whereby the last spraying process serves to clean and/or neutralise <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> covering or plates of previous spray fluids. ADVANTAGE - Process increases slip-preventing effect...|$|R
5|$|A typical {{sea anemone}} {{is a single}} polyp {{attached}} to a hard surface by its base, but some species live in soft sediment and a few float near <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> The polyp has a columnar trunk topped by an oral disc with a ring of tentacles and a central mouth. The tentacles can be retracted inside the body cavity or expanded to catch passing prey. They are armed with cnidocytes (stinging cells). In many species, additional nourishment comes from a symbiotic relationship with single-celled dinoflagellates, zooxanthellae or with green algae, zoochlorellae, that live within the cells. Some species of sea anemone live in association with hermit crabs, small fish or other animals to their mutual benefit.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from their}} blue colour, the mythical creatures {{look much like}} humans, and {{are about the same}} size. They have the power to create storms, but when the weather is fine they float {{sleeping}} on or just below <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> The blue men swim with their torsos raised out of the sea, twisting and diving as porpoises do. They are able to speak, and when a group approaches a ship its chief may shout two lines of poetry to the master of the vessel and challenge him to complete the verse. If the skipper fails in that task then the blue men will attempt to overturn the ship and capsize it.|$|E
5|$|By late December 1946, {{the ship}} was in very bad condition; on 21 December, she began to list severely. A salvage team could not be brought to Kwajalein in time, so the US Navy {{attempted}} to beach the ship to prevent her from sinking, but on 22 December, Prinz Eugen capsized and sank. Her main battery gun turrets fell out of their barbettes when the ship rolled over. The ship's stern, including her propeller assemblies, remains visible above <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> The US government denied salvage rights {{on the grounds that}} it did not want the irradiated steel entering the market. In August 1979, one of the ship's screw propellers was retrieved and placed in the Laboe Naval Memorial in Germany. The ship's bell is currently held at the National Museum of the United States Navy, while the bell from Tegetthoff is held in Graz, Austria.|$|E
25|$|Impurities and defects on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> billet affect <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extrusion. These defects {{ruin the}} piece if {{it needs to}} be {{anodized}} or the aesthetics are important. In order to get around this the billets may be wire brushed, machined or chemically cleaned before being used.|$|R
30|$|After heat-treated, P 1 {{was more}} smooth, and the layered {{structure}} disappeared. In contrast, <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original (P 2) cokes were smooth and dense in texture, with a barely porous structure. However, <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heat-treated petroleum cokes were more rough with more fold structure and some porous structure.|$|R
500|$|Lake Vostok {{is located}} at <b>the</b> {{southern}} Pole <b>of</b> Cold, beneath Russia's Vostok Station under <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central East Antarctic Ice Sheet, which is at [...] above mean sea level. <b>The</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> this fresh water lake is approximately [...] under <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ice, which places it at approximately [...] below sea level.|$|R
5|$|Crocodilians are large, low-slung aquatic {{reptiles}} {{with long}} snouts and {{large numbers of}} teeth. The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed. It undulates {{from side to side}} to force the animal through the water when swimming. The tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull. The nostrils, eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> when the animal is floating. Valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged. Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.|$|E
5|$|Egg-laying {{takes two}} {{different}} forms {{depending on the}} species. The female in some families has a sharp-edged ovipositor with which she slits open a stem or leaf of a plant {{on or near the}} water, so she can push her eggs inside. In other families such as clubtails (Gomphidae), cruisers (Macromiidae), emeralds (Corduliidae), and skimmers (Libellulidae), the female lays eggs by tapping <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> repeatedly with her abdomen, by shaking the eggs out of her abdomen as she flies along, or by placing the eggs on vegetation. In a few species, the eggs are laid on emergent plants above the water, and development is delayed until these have withered and become immersed.|$|E
5|$|Frank and {{the group}} reach the sub, and they take control of it. After betraying the Man in Black, Widmore's men attack, but they manage to submerge. Jack then discovers the Man in Black planted the C4 in Jack's bag. Sayid sacrifices himself and runs off with the C4 {{as far away from}} the others as he could until it explodes. The {{explosion}} causes the submarine to sink, and Frank is knocked out after a door hits him. Frank revives and makes it to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> He is found by Richard and Miles as they head for Hydra Island to blow up the Ajira plane. Frank convinces them to steal the plane and let him fly it. After much repair work and picking up Kate, Claire, and Sawyer, the plane takes off and heads for home.|$|E
30|$|The highest {{occupied}} {{molecular orbital}} (HOMO) should be located far from <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conduction band <b>of</b> TiO 2 {{and the lowest}} unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) should be placed as close to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TiO 2, and subsequently should be higher {{with respect to the}} TiO 2 conduction band potential.|$|R
30|$|Polymer {{adsorption}} {{can simply}} {{be defined as}} the interaction between <b>the</b> solid <b>surface</b> (soft rock) and the polymer molecules. It allows the polymer to be physical adsorbed to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solid, hydrogen bond and van der Waal’s forces acting on the molecules and solid <b>surface.</b> <b>The</b> polymer usually adsorbs on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solid, and if <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solid is large, the higher <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> adsorption (Sorbie 1991; Sheng 2011).|$|R
30|$|In case of {{adsorption}} by solids {{from the}} solutions, mostly the solute is adsorbed on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solid adsorbent so that <b>the</b> concentration <b>of</b> solute on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adsorbent {{is greater than}} in the bulk. This is known as positive adsorption. In some cases, the solvent from the solution may be absorbed by the adsorbent so that <b>the</b> concentration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solution increases than the initial concentration. This is called negative adsorption. Hence, if <b>the</b> concentration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adsorbate is less on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adsorbent than in the bulk, it is known as negative adsorption.|$|R
