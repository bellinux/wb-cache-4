5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>Stranger</b> {{continues}} {{to explore the}} island, books linking to more Ages are discovered hidden behind complex mechanisms and puzzles. <b>The</b> <b>Stranger</b> must visit each Age, find the red and blue pages hidden there, and return to Myst Island. These pages can then {{be placed in the}} corresponding books. As <b>the</b> <b>Stranger</b> adds more pages to these books, the brothers can be seen and heard more clearly. After collecting four pages, the brothers can talk clearly enough to tell <b>the</b> <b>Stranger</b> where the fifth and final missing page for their book is hidden; if <b>the</b> <b>Stranger</b> can complete either book, that brother will be set free. The clearer dialog also allows the player to more accurately judge each brother's personality. <b>The</b> <b>Stranger</b> is left with a choice to help Sirrus, Achenar, or neither.|$|E
5|$|Sirrus and Achenar beg <b>the</b> <b>Stranger</b> not {{to touch}} the green book that is stored in the same {{location}} as their final pages. They claim {{that it is a}} book like their own that will trap <b>the</b> <b>Stranger.</b> In truth, it leads to D'ni, where Atrus is imprisoned. When the book is opened, Atrus asks <b>the</b> <b>Stranger</b> to bring him a final page that is hidden on Myst Island; without it, he cannot bring his sons to justice. The game has several endings, depending on the player's actions. Giving either Sirrus or Achenar the final page of their book causes <b>the</b> <b>Stranger</b> to switch places with the son, leaving the player trapped inside the Prison book. Linking to D'ni without the page Atrus asks for leaves <b>the</b> <b>Stranger</b> and Atrus trapped on D'ni. Linking to D'ni with the page allows Atrus to complete his Myst book and return to the island. Upon returning to the library, the player finds the red and blue books gone, and burn marks on the shelves where they used to be.|$|E

Dorian said that Khali was just an ally of <b>the</b> <b>strangers.</b> Trace may have allied herself with one of <b>the</b> <b>Strangers</b> when Durzo used the black ka'kari's magic to kill her. Khali uses the power of the Ka'kari's compulsion powers to control Khalidor and others.|$|R
5|$|As Atrus is {{preparing}} to leave for Releeshahn, a mysterious man appears in Atrus' study, steals the Releeshahn book and leaves behind another. Following the thief, <b>the</b> <b>Stranger</b> arrives at J'nanin, an Age that Atrus had written long before {{as a way to}} teach the Art to his sons. Because the thief has caused considerable damage to the J'nanin book, Atrus cannot accompany <b>the</b> <b>Stranger.</b>|$|E
5|$|As in {{previous}} games, the player assumes {{the role of}} <b>the</b> <b>Stranger,</b> a friend of Atrus. A member of the D'ni race, Atrus can create links to other worlds called Ages by writing descriptive books. In Exile, Atrus has written an Age for the D'ni to live on while rebuilding their civilization; it is stolen, however, by a mysterious figure. <b>The</b> <b>Stranger</b> pursues the thief {{in an attempt to}} reclaim Atrus' book.|$|E
5|$|Atrus calls <b>the</b> <b>Stranger</b> to {{his home}} in Tomahna to request his friend's assistance. Atrus is the writer of special books, which serve as links to worlds known as Ages. Twenty years earlier, his two sons, Sirrus and Achenar, {{destroyed}} his library on Myst and trapped their parents in order to plunder the wealth of Atrus' Ages. The Stranger's intervention saved Atrus, who had imprisoned his sons via traps intended for thieves. Atrus' wife Catherine hopes that, after twenty years, they have finally repented for their crimes. Atrus is not as sure his sons have reformed, and so wishes <b>the</b> <b>Stranger</b> to act as an impartial judge. After being knocked unconscious by an explosion, <b>the</b> <b>Stranger</b> realizes that Yeesha, Atrus' daughter, has disappeared.|$|E

Ten years later, Atrus asks for the Stranger's help in determining if his sons have repented after their lengthy imprisonment; <b>the</b> <b>Stranger</b> saves Yeesha from Sirrus' machinations, but Sirrus and a repentant Achenar are killed.

5|$|Basil Mitchell {{responded to}} Flew's falsification {{principle}} {{with his own}} parable. He described an underground resistance soldier who meets a stranger who claims to be leading the resistance movement. <b>The</b> <b>stranger</b> tells the soldier to keep faith in him, {{even if he is}} seen to be fighting for the other side. The soldier's faith is regularly tested as he observes <b>the</b> <b>stranger</b> fighting for both sides, but his faith remains strong. Mitchell's parable teaches that although evidence can challenge a religious belief, a believer still has reason to hold their views. He argued that although a believer will not allow anything to count decisively against his beliefs, the theist still accepts the existence of evidence which could count against religious belief.|$|E
