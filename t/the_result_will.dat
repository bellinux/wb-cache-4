5|$|Damage to the {{trochlear nerve}} (IV) {{can also cause}} {{diplopia}} with the eye adducted and elevated. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>will</b> be an eye which can not move downwards properly (especially downwards when in an inward position). This is due to impairment in the superior oblique muscle, which is innervated by the trochlear nerve.|$|E
5|$|As this {{scenario}} continues, by 100 million {{years from the}} present the continental spreading will have reached its maximum extent and the continents will then begin to coalesce. In 250 million years, North America will collide with Africa while South America will wrap around {{the southern tip of}} Africa. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>will</b> be the formation of a new supercontinent (sometimes called Pangaea Ultima), with the Pacific Ocean stretching across half the planet. The continent of Antarctica will reverse direction and return to the South Pole, building up a new ice cap.|$|E

25|$|First {{check to}} see if the {{multiplier}} is negative. If so, negate (i.e., take the two's complement of) both operands before multiplying.

25|$|On 9 May 2008, Diageo {{announced}} that the St James's Gate brewery will remain open and undergo renovations, but that breweries in Kilkenny and Dundalk will be closed by 2013 when a new larger brewery is opened near Dublin. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>will</b> be a loss of roughly 250 jobs across the entire Diageo/Guinness workforce in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Using an {{ordinary}} two-flute twist drill bit {{to enlarge the}} hole resulting from a casting core will not produce a clean result, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>will</b> possibly be out of round, off center and generally of poor finish.

25|$|Formally, the gluing {{is defined}} by a {{bijection}} between the two boundaries. Two points are identified when they are mapped onto each other.

25|$|The {{standard}} {{range of}} the whistle is two octaves. For a D whistle, this includes notes from D5 to D7; that is, from the second D above middle C to the fourth D above middle C.

25|$|ISSR (for inter-simple {{sequence}} repeat) is {{a general}} term for a genome region between microsatellite loci. The complementary sequences to two neighboring microsatellites are used as PCR primers; the variable region between them gets amplified. The limited length of amplification cycles during PCR prevents excessive replication of overly long contiguous DNA sequences, so <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>will</b> be a mix {{of a variety of}} amplified DNA strands which are generally short but vary much in length.|$|E

25|$|The {{justification}} for this definition {{is to preserve}} {{the sign of the}} result in case of arithmetic underflow. For example, in the single-precision computation 1/(x/2), where x = ±2−149, the computation x/2 underflows and produces ±0 with sign matching x, and <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>will</b> be ±∞ with sign matching x. The sign will match that of the exact result ±2150, but the magnitude of the exact result is too large to represent, so infinity is used to indicate overflow.|$|E
25|$|The axioms {{of a group}} formalize the {{essential}} aspects of symmetry. Symmetries form a group: they are closed because {{if you take a}} symmetry of an object, and then apply another symmetry, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>will</b> still be a symmetry. The identity keeping the object fixed is always a symmetry of an object. Existence of inverses is guaranteed by undoing the symmetry and the associativity {{comes from the fact that}} symmetries are functions on a space, and composition of functions are associative.|$|E
25|$|The best {{representation}} of {{this difference is}} e=−1; s=4.877000, which differs more than 20% from e=−1; s=4.000000. In extreme cases, all significant digits of precision can be lost (although gradual underflow ensures that <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>will</b> not be zero unless the two operands were equal). This cancellation illustrates the danger in assuming {{that all of the}} digits of a computed result are meaningful. Dealing with the consequences of these errors is a topic in numerical analysis; see also Accuracy problems.|$|E

25|$|In the Chinese rules, {{there is}} no penalty for playing within one's {{territory}} {{at the end of}} the game, for example to kill and remove dead enemy groups.

25|$|We are {{now living}} in a G-Zero world, one in which no single country or bloc of {{countries}} has {{the political and economic}} leverage—or the will—to drive a truly international agenda. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>will</b> be intensified conflict on the international stage over vitally important issues, such as international macroeconomic coordination, financial regulatory reform, trade policy, and climate change. This new order has far-reaching implications for the global economy, as companies around the world sit on enormous stockpiles of cash, waiting for the current era of political and economic uncertainty to pass. Many of them can expect an extended wait.|$|E

It's sometimes a nightmare to work with him in the studio because of the pride he puts into the smallest details. If he's not in the right mood or doesn't find the correct words we get nothing done.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. The proposed research will implement {{a new approach}} to study reading by functionally synchronising state-of-the-art eyetracking and electrophysiological (EEG) apparatus. The project will examine well-known word frequency and contextual predictability effects in reading, when target words of interest are processed both parafoveally (from the prior eye fixation) and subsequently, foveally (from the target fixation). It is expected that <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>will</b> provide a better psychological and neurophysiological understanding of parafoveal preview benefit, foveal processing, and oculomotor (eye movement) control in reading. In terms of psychological processes, the methods employed will reveal a fine-grained temporal structure of these basic components of reading. Although computationally complex, the proposed approach relies on key features which contrast with traditional techniques and which provide greater statistical reliability. There are novel findings which can only be obtained by using this methodology. First <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>will</b> help to discriminate current and contentious hypotheses about how a reader's visual attention is allocated during reading (serial versus parallel). Second <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>will</b> provide a detailed time course of eye movement motor programming. Finally <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>will</b> further inform theories of reading and reading disorders. From a neuroscience perspective, this approach will help reveal the cerebral dynamics of natural reading...|$|R
