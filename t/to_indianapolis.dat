5|$|In the B story, April (Aubrey Plaza) {{is working}} as Chris' (Rob Lowe) {{assistant}} until {{he goes back}} <b>to</b> <b>Indianapolis.</b> April's cynical personality clashes with Chris' relentless optimism and happiness. In {{an attempt to get}} fired, April purposely neglects to tell Ann (Rashida Jones) that Chris cannot make a lunch date. When Ann arrives to confront Chris, she quickly realizes April's ploy. Ann reveals she is very happy dating Chris, and would even probably move with him <b>to</b> <b>Indianapolis</b> if asked. Andy (Chris Pratt), who is still trying to win back April's affections, gives Chris an obviously forged letter from the FBI claiming April must immediately return to the parks department. Chris sees through the ruse and tells April she can go back, but that remaining his assistant may provide her career opportunities. He invites her to return with him <b>to</b> <b>Indianapolis</b> and she seems interested, leaving both Ann and Andy stunned and jealous.|$|E
5|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) and Ron (Nick Offerman) head up <b>to</b> <b>Indianapolis</b> {{to receive}} a {{commendation}} at the Indiana Statehouse for reestablishing the Pawnee Harvest Festival, although Ron is only interested in eating at Charles Mulligan's Steak House, his favorite restaurant. Ann (Rashida Jones) tells Leslie her last talk with Chris (Rob Lowe) reassured her their relationship was fine, {{but he has been}} acting distant since then. She asks Leslie to look for signs of whether Chris is cheating on her, since he has since returned <b>to</b> <b>Indianapolis.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Chris tells Ben {{they have}} been called back <b>to</b> <b>Indianapolis</b> for a new assignment, but both agree to seek an {{extension}} to stay in Pawnee longer. Although both claim they want to help organize the Harvest Festival, it is hinted they really want to stay because of Leslie and Ann.|$|E

5|$|In 1888, Indiana Senator Benjamin Harrison, {{grandson}} of territorial Governor William Henry Harrison, was elected President after an intense battle that attracted more than 300,000 partisans <b>to</b> <b>Indianapolis</b> {{to hear him}} speak from his famous front porch. Fort Benjamin Harrison was named in his honor. Six Hoosiers have been elected as Vice-President. The most recent was Mike Pence, elected in 2016.|$|E

5|$|The {{relocation}} <b>to</b> <b>Indianapolis</b> was {{an arduous}} task. At {{the time it}} was an eleven-day journey by horseback from Corydon to the new capital. To complicate matters, no road existed and a path for the wagons had to be cut through the dense forests during the winter transit as the long caravan moved north. The caravan was large because it contained the state treasury, state library, state records, the furniture of the General Assembly, Supreme Court, and ExecutIve Offices, along with a whole host of other implements to aid the caravan on its long journey. Colonel Samuel Merrill, the state treasurer, was authorized by the General Assembly to oversee the move. Ultimately, it took more than a month to relocate the government <b>to</b> <b>Indianapolis.</b> The first session of the General Assembly convened there in January 1825.|$|E
5|$|After the Gas Boom {{began to}} sweep {{the state in the}} 1880s, Lilly and other Commercial Club members {{advocated}} the creation of a public corporation to pump natural gas from the ground, pipe it <b>to</b> <b>Indianapolis</b> from the Trenton Gas Field, and provide it at low cost to businesses and homes. The project {{led to the creation of}} the Consumer Gas Trust Company, which Lilly named. The gas company provided low-cost heating fuel that made urban living much more desirable. The gas was further used to create electricity to run Indianapolis's first public transportation venture, a streetcar system.|$|E
5|$|Against his father's wishes, Peter Fluor {{expanded}} Fluor's business {{outside of}} California in the 1930s. It built refineries in Texas, {{as well as}} oil pipelines and compressor stations from Panhandle, Texas, <b>to</b> <b>Indianapolis,</b> Indiana, for the Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Company. Fluor constructed the Escondida in Chile, which is the second-largest copper mine in the world. In 1942, Fluor constructed cooling towers and other facilities in Hanford, Washington, for the Manhattan Project. It built {{an expansion of the}} Dhahran Airfield in Saudi Arabia for the United States Army in the 1950s and accepted its first international project for ARAMCO in the Middle East.|$|E

5|$|Chris tells Ann {{that after}} Indianapolis, {{he will be}} sent to a {{different}} city. The two agree they need to talk about the future of their relationship. Meanwhile, Andy's difficult day of running errands for April culminates with him getting arrested after April's sister Natalie (Minni Jo Mazzola) claims he is kidnapping her when he is merely picking her up from school. Ron approaches April and tells her that she should either forgive Andy or cut him loose, believing that she is only stringing Andy along and going <b>to</b> <b>Indianapolis</b> to spite him. When Andy returns, April finally forgives him and kisses him.|$|E
5|$|During {{the ensuing}} {{assassination}} investigation, suspicion naturally focused on deposed governor Taylor, who fled <b>to</b> <b>Indianapolis,</b> Indiana under the looming threat of indictment. The governor of Indiana refused to extradite Taylor, {{and he was}} thus never questioned about {{his knowledge of the}} plot to kill Goebel. Taylor became a successful lawyer in Indiana, and was pardoned in 1909 by Beckham's successor, Republican Augustus E. Willson.|$|E
5|$|Financially {{strapped}} by {{the costs}} of challenging the election, Taylor became an insurance executive and practiced law. Shortly after arriving in Indiana, his wife died. In 1912, he briefly returned to Kentucky to marry Nora A. Myers. The couple returned <b>to</b> <b>Indianapolis</b> and had a son together. Taylor died of heart disease on August 2, 1928, and was buried at the Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis.|$|E

5|$|Following the Supreme Court ruling, Taylor fled <b>to</b> <b>Indianapolis,</b> Indiana, fearing {{he would}} be implicated in Goebel's assassination. Beckham became acting governor, {{but because of the}} unusual {{circumstances}} surrounding the election, a special election was held November 6, 1900, to determine who would complete Goebel's unexpired term. Beckham (now of age) won the election over Republican John W. Yerkes by fewer than 4,000 votes. Shortly following the special election, Beckham married Jean Raphael Fuqua of Owensboro. The couple had two sons.|$|E
5|$|In 1824 the Supreme Court {{relocated}} <b>to</b> <b>Indianapolis</b> {{with the}} rest of the state's government. Initially the Court shared space on the second floor of the Marion County Courthouse, before moving to the third Indiana Statehouse. In 1865 the Court was given its own building on lot number one in Indianapolis, where it remained until 1888, moving to its present location in the fifth Indiana Statehouse. As of 2012 the Court occupies the entire north wing of the third floor of the Indiana Statehouse.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Shafer {{signed with}} Cap Anson's Chicago White Stockings. However, {{he had left}} Indianapolis the {{previous}} year with some unpaid debts. The White Stockings traveled <b>to</b> <b>Indianapolis</b> to play an exhibition game in June, and the local sheriff was waiting for both him and teammate Silver Flint. After the game, Shafer and Flint escaped the ballpark in a horse-drawn carriage to avoid arrest, and only their manager, Anson, was taken to jail.|$|E

5|$|In 1885 the Democrats redistricted the Indiana state legislature, which {{resulted}} in an increased Democratic majority in 1886, despite an overall Republican majority statewide. In 1887, {{largely as a result}} of the Democratic gerrymandering of Indiana's legislative districts, Harrison was defeated in his bid for reelection. Following a deadlock in the state senate, the state legislature eventually chose Democrat David Turpie as Harrison's successor in the U.S. Senate. Harrison returned <b>to</b> <b>Indianapolis</b> and resumed his law practice, but stayed active in state and national politics.|$|E
5|$|In 1909 the Art Association {{campaigned for}} a major retrospective, the Augustus Saint-Gaudens Memorial Exhibition, to be brought <b>to</b> <b>Indianapolis.</b> The exhibition, also {{referred}} to as the Saint-Gaudens Memorial Exhibition of Statuary, attracted 56,000 visitors during its three-month run, well beyond the board's goal of attracting 50,000 visitors. A 1937 exhibition, Dutch Paintings of the Seventeenth Century, included loans from the Cincinnati Art Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam. The six-week exhibition presented 65 pieces, including several Rembrandts, and was considered the beginning of the museum's rise to connoisseurship.|$|E
5|$|In {{its first}} two decades, the General Assembly laid the {{foundation}} of the state. They created the framework for the state's public school system, began construction on the State Seminary and of roads {{in the southern part of}} the state. Initially, the General Assembly was faced with low tax revenues. In response to the problem, they created the Bank of Indiana and sold nine million acres (36,000km²) of public lands to finance their projects. The General Assembly relocated the capitol <b>to</b> <b>Indianapolis</b> in 1824, and in 1831 they authorized the construction of the first dedicated statehouse.|$|E
