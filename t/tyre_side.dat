50|$|The weather {{remained}} dry and hot for the Saturday morning practice sessions. Coulthard set {{the fastest}} {{time of the}} third practice session, a 1:15.965. Häkkinen was second fastest, almost two-tenths of a second off Coulthard's pace. The two Jordan drivers were running quicker; Trulli in third and Frentzen in fourth. Both Jaguars continued to be quick with Irvine fifth and Herbert eighth. The two were separated by Michael Schumacher and Button. Barrichello and de la Rosa rounded out the top ten. In the final practice session, Coulthard was unable to improve his time because of an engine failure though he remained fastest. Häkkinen managed to set a quicker time and remained with the second quickest lap. Barrichello ran quicker and was third fastest, in front of Ralf Schumacher. The Jordan drivers remained fastest-Trulli was fifth and Frentzen sixth-their best times two thousands of a second apart. Irvine was seventh quickest, ahead of Michael Schumacher who concentrated on qualifying set-up. Button and Herbert completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. My first run was spot on {{and that is the}} main reason I took pole, because others seemed to improve on their later runs. The car was good so we did not need to make many changes in between the runs. So far the weekend is going well, partly because of the good work we did here last week. But you cannot rely on the testing as conditions change so quickly here, especially on the <b>tyre</b> <b>side.</b> You must be prepared to change the car according to what conditions you find. There have been some comments about the problem of the position of the pit lane exit, but with the extra speed at which the cars will leave the pits in the race, I don’t {{think it will be a}} problem tomorrow. Michael Schumacher, commenting on taking pole position. Saturday's afternoon qualifying session lasted for an hour. Each driver was limited to twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap to qualify for the race. The qualifying session was held in dry and hot weather conditions. Michael Schumacher clinched his fourth pole position of the season, his third at the circuit, with a time of 1:15.632. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Coulthard with his fastest time was 0.102 seconds slower and used his team's spare monocoque while the McLaren mechanics fitted his race car with a new fuel pump. Barrichello secured third having changed his car's set-up during the session which garnered confusion over changes in the ride height. Häkkinen took fourth and was pushed down to his position by Barrichello with the Finn struggling in the slow speed corners. Ralf Schumacher qualified fifth and was happy with his starting position. Irvine was pushed down by Ralf Schumacher to sixth in the closing stages of qualifying. BAR driver Jacques Villeneuve managed seventh. The Jordan drivers of Trulli and Frentzen took seventh and eighth positions respectively although both drivers were disappointed with their performance. Button rounded out the top ten fastest qualifiers. Herbert, who took eleventh, missed out in qualifying in the top ten by nearly three-tenths of a second. Salo captured twelfth on the grid with his fastest time set when air and track temperatures were lowered by cloud cover. He was ahead of de la Rosa in the faster of the two Arrows. Fisichella started from 14th position, nearly one-tenth of a second in front of Benetton teammate Alexander Wurz; both drivers complained that their cars had balance and grip issues. The two were split by Pedro Diniz in the other Sauber and Heidfeld. Alesi followed up in 18th. Ricardo Zonta set the 19th fastest time and used BAR's spare car when an engine failure on his race car occurred. Verstappen and the two Minardi drivers Marc Gené and Gastón Mazzacane qualified at the rear of the grid, covering positions 20 to 22. After the qualifying session, but before the warm-up period, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) safety delegate, Charlie Whiting announced that he had banned practice starts at the pit lane exit after observing the drivers' behaviour in the area during the Saturday free practice sessions.|$|E

50|$|Australian road {{transport}} {{has a reputation}} for using very large trucks and road trains. This is reflected in the most popular configurations of trucks generally having dual drive axles and three axles on the trailers, with four tyres on each axle. This means that Australian single semi-trailer trucks will usually have 22 tyres, which is generally more than their counterparts in other countries. Super single tyres are sometimes used on tri-axle trailers. The suspension is designed with travel limiting, which will hold the rim off the road for one blown or deflated <b>tyre</b> for each <b>side</b> of the trailer, so a trailer can be driven at reduced speed to a safe place for repair. Super singles are also often used on the steer axle in Australia to allow greater loading over the steer axle. The increase in loading of steer tyres requires a permit.|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, Rosberg got off the line well and overtook {{teammate}} Hamilton for the lead going into turn one. Coming out of the following turn, Kimi Räikkönen was caught out by heavy wheelspin on his harder <b>tyre</b> compound going <b>side</b> by side and swept to the outside of the track, crashing into Fernando Alonso's McLaren, who was lifted on top of the Ferrari. Both drivers were able to walk away unharmed from the incident. The collision brought out the safety car. At the end of the lap, Daniil Kvyat made a pit stop to replace a damaged front wing, while Will Stevens retired from the race with an oil leak. When the safety car came back into the pit lane on the end of lap six, Rosberg was able to defend his lead against Hamilton and quickly built a gap, leading him by 2.3 seconds by lap eleven. Lap twelve saw the second McLaren of Jenson Button retiring with an intake system sensor failure.|$|R

40|$|A {{spring is}} defined as an elastic body, whose {{function}} is to compress when loaded and to recover its original shape when the load is removed. A spring is a flexible element used to exert a force or a torque and, at the same time, to store energy. The force can be a linear push or pull, {{or it can be}} radial. In two wheelers we used to see helical suspension at the front and rear <b>tyres</b> on both <b>sides.</b> But the new model bikes are replacing the rear double suspension with the single heavy duty suspension.

By seeing the results, Comparison is done for four materials to validate better material for suspension system by doing analysis on spring with help of ANSYS software for find out which material is best for the suspension system. And also we modified the actual model and also conducting the same analysis on it and validating that which model is better. The modeling done in Creo- 5 and analysis is done Ansys package...|$|R

Saturday afternoon's qualifying session ran for 60 minutes was divided into four groups of five cars. Each group was determined by a lottery system and were permitted six minutes of on-track activity. All drivers were limited to two timed laps with one at maximum power. The fastest five competitors in the four groups were scheduled to participate in a [...] "Super Pole" [...] session with one driver on track at any time and went out in reverse order. Each of the five drivers were limited to one timed lap and the starting order was determined by the competitors fastest times. The driver and team who recorded the fastest time were awarded three points towards both championships. Qualifying was held in warm weather conditions. The modifications to the kerb and a dirty track resulted in lap times being at least one second slower than had been observed in qualifying and Super Pole was cancelled following several long delays caused by drivers crashing their cars and the starting order was determined by the fastest overall times in the four groups.|$|R
40|$|Traffic is a {{major source}} of green house gases. The {{transport}} field stands for 32 % of the energy consumption and 28 % of the total CO 2 emissions, where road transports alone causes 84 % of these figures. The energy consumed by a car traveling at constant speed, is due to engine ineffiency, internal friction, and the energy needed to overcome resisting forces such as aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance. Rolling resistance plays a rather large role when it comes to fuel economy. An improvement in rolling resistance of 10 % can yield fuel consumption improvements ranging from 0. 5 to 1. 5 % for passenger cars and light trucks and 1. 5 to 3 % for heavy trucks. The objective of this thesis is to estimate the power consumption in the tyres. To do this a car tyre is modeled with waveguide finite elements. A non-linear contact model is used to calculate the contact forces as the tyre is rolling on a rough road. The contact forces combined with the response of the tyre is used to estimate the input power to the tyre structure, which determines {{a significant part of the}} rolling resistance. The tyre model accounts for: the curvature, the geometry of the cross-section, the pre-stress due to inflation pressure, the anisotropic material properties and the rigid body properties of the rim. The model is based on design data. The motion of the <b>tyre</b> belt and <b>side</b> wall is described with quadratic anisotropic, deep shell elements that includes pre-stress and the motion of the tread on top of the tyre by quadratic, Lagrange type, homogenous, isotropic two dimensional elements. To validate the tyre model, mobility measurements and an experimental modal analysis has been made. The model agrees very well with point mobility measurements up to roughly 250 Hz. The eigenfrequency prediction is within five percent for most of the identified modes. The estimated damping is a bit too low especially for the antisymmetric modes. Above 500 Hz there is an error ranging from 1. 5 dB up to 3. 5 dB for the squared amplitude of the point mobility. The non proportional damping used in the model is based on an ad hoc curve fitting procedure against measured mobilities. The contact force predictions, made by the division of applied acoustics, Chalmers University of Technology, are based on a non-linear contact model in which the tyre structure is described by its flexibility matrix. Topographies of the surface are scanned, the tread pattern is accounted for, and then the tyre is ’rolled’ over it. The contact forces are inserted into the tyre model and the response is calculated. The dissipated power is then calculated through the injected power and the power dissipated within each element. Results are promising compared to literature and measurements. QC 20101112 </p...|$|R
40|$|When an {{articulated}} tipper unit {{is being}} loaded or is tipping, {{it is unlikely}} to be standing on perfectly level ground. Also, the centre of gravity of the load is unlikely to be in the centre of the body. Hence the loads carried by the suspension and <b>tyres</b> on one <b>side</b> of the tipper will be greater than those on the other side. This uneven loading will cause the tyres and suspension {{on one side of the}} tipper unit to deform more than those on the other side. It will also cause the chassis to deform; the twisting about its longitudinal axis being the most significant mode of deformation. As a result of these deformations caused by the uneven loading, the position of the centre of gravity will be shifted even further towards the more heavily loaded side. This will cause even more uneven loading and further deformations. Under stable conditions a situation will exist at which the position of the centre of gravity, the deformations and the forces transmitted through the system are compatible. Instability, resulting in roll-over would occur if the overall centre of gravity of the load, body, chassis etc. were to fall outside the area bounded by the contact of the wheel with the ground, before a stable condition was reached. Many factors influence the roll stability. To increase stability, an understanding of the influence of components of the lorry on the stability is required. In order to achieve this, a theoretical model of an articulated tipper was developed which will allow roll-over predictions to be made for a given lorry in likely attitudes. In this model dimensions and stiffness of the lorry components can be altered to assess their influence on roll stability. The previous theoretical roll-over models were based on lumped mass systems, representing various parts of the lorry inter-connected by compliant elements. Certain flexibilities such as the tyres, suspension units, etc. could be obtained from the respective components manufacturers but the tractor and trailer chassis flexibilities are unknown. To overcome this problem the flexibilities were obtained from full scale static tilt tests. This is a very expensive undertaking, providing a limited means in which to assess those elements of trailer design which are important in improving stability, without further recourse to more tilt tests. It was decided that the finite element method should be used to model the tractor and trailer, in order to determine the important deformations. Once the finite element model is created it is relatively straight forward to make changes to the structure. Hence an assessment of component contribution to roll stability can be undertaken relatively inexpensively. Whilst a vehicle operator should always endeavour to discharge the payload with the vehicle standing on level ground, practical situations arise where this is not possible. This may be due to the absence of level ground or poor judgement by the operator, which may result in the vehicle being tipped on a lateral ground slope. As a result of this, the maximum ground slope angle considered for the theoretical model is limited to eight degrees, as this position is at least twice the severity of ground slope on which a vehicle should normally be tipped. For each trailer design, the magnitude of the load, position of the load, ram length and ground slope can be varied in any combination. Four payloads and up to nine payload positions are considered, varying the ground slope from 0 to 8 degrees and varying the ram length from 2 to 8 meters. Also, three further chassis configurations, based on the reference chassis were modelled to investigate the contribution of important component flexibilities on roll stability...|$|R
