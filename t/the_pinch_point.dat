5000|$|Classical pinch-analysis {{primarily}} calculates {{the energy}} {{costs for the}} heating and cooling utility. At <b>the</b> <b>pinch</b> <b>point,</b> where the hot and cold streams are the most constrained, large heat exchangers are required to transfer heat between the hot and cold streams. Large heat exchangers entail high investment costs. In order to reduce capital cost, in practice a minimum temperature difference (Δ T) at <b>the</b> <b>pinch</b> <b>point</b> is demanded, e.g., 10 °F. It is possible to estimate the heat exchanger area and capital cost, and hence the optimal Δ T minimum value. However, the cost curve is quite flat and the optimum may be affected by [...] "topology traps". The pinch method is not always appropriate for simple networks or where severe operating constraints exist. Kemp (2006) discusses these aspects in detail.|$|E

50|$|The {{process data}} is {{represented}} {{as a set of}} energy flows, or streams, as a function of heat load (kW) against temperature (deg C). These data are combined for all the streams in the plant to give composite curves, one for all hot streams (releasing heat) and one for all cold streams (requiring heat). The point of closest approach between the hot and cold composite curves is <b>the</b> <b>pinch</b> <b>point</b> (or just pinch) with a hot stream pinch temperature and a cold stream pinch temperature. This is where the design is most constrained. Hence, by finding this point and starting the design there, the energy targets can be achieved using heat exchangers to recover heat between hot and cold streams in two separate systems, one for temperatures above pinch temperatures and one for temperatures below pinch temperatures. In practice, during the pinch analysis of an existing design, often cross-pinch exchanges of heat are found between a hot stream with its temperature above the pinch and a cold stream below the pinch. Removal of those exchangers by alternative matching makes the process reach its energy target.|$|E
5000|$|Mechanical punch presses {{fall into}} two {{distinct}} types, {{depending on the type}} of clutch or braking system with which they are equipped. Generally older presses are [...] "full revolution" [...] presses that require a full revolution of the crankshaft for them to come to a stop. Full revolution clutch presses are known to be dangerous and outlawed in many countries unless <b>the</b> <b>pinch</b> <b>point</b> is fully guarded. This is because the braking mechanism depends on a set of raised keys or [...] "dogs" [...] to fall into matching slots to stop the ram. A full revolution clutch can only bring the ram to a stop at the same location- top dead center. Newer presses are often [...] "part revolution" [...] presses equipped with braking systems identical to the brakes on commercial trucks. When air is applied, a band-type brake expands and allows the crankshaft to revolve. When the stopping mechanism is applied the air is bled, causing the clutch to open and the braking system to close, stopping the ram in any part of its rotation. Modern part revolution clutch & brake units are normally combined units that operate in a fail safe mode, a dual air safety valve engages clutch and starts slide motion and brake is applied by springs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this note}} we {{construct}} strange attractors {{in a class}} of skew product dynamical systems. A dynamical system of the class is a bundle map of a trivial bundle whose base is a compact metric space and the fiber is the non-negative half real line. The map on the base is a homeomorphism preserving an ergodic measure. The fiber maps either are strictly monotone and strictly concave or collapse at zero (<b>pinching</b> condition). <b>The</b> <b>points</b> on the base space whose fibers collapse are <b>the</b> <b>pinched</b> <b>points</b> of <b>the</b> skew product. We also assume that <b>the</b> set of <b>pinched</b> <b>points</b> has zero measure, {{and that there is a}} <b>pinched</b> <b>point</b> whose orbit is dense in the base space. Moreover, we assume that the zero-section is a super-repeller, in the sense that it is invariant and its Lyapunov exponent is +∞. For such a skew product dynamical system, we prove the existence of a measurable but non-continuous invariant graph, whose Lyapunov exponent is negative. We will refer to such an object as a strange attractor. Since the dynamics on the strange attractor is the one given by the base homeomorphism, we will say that it is a strange chaotic attractor or a strange non-chaotic attractor depending on the fact that the dynamics on the base is chaotic or non-chaotic. 1...|$|R

Research of the S-CO 2 cycles is ongoing at the Czech Technical University (CTU) as well. Research on CTU is focused on <b>the</b> <b>pinch</b> <b>point</b> analysis.

40|$|The main {{theme of}} this paper is to study the {{flammability}} suppression of hydrocarbons by blending with carbon dioxide, and to evaluate these mixtures as possible working fluids in organic Rankine cycle for medium temperature concentrated solar power applications. The analysis takes into account inevitable irreversibilities in the turbine, the pump, and heat exchangers. While the isopentane + CO 2 mixture suffers from high irreversibility mainly in the regenerator owing to a large temperature glide, the propane + CO 2 mixture performs more or less the same as pure propane albeit with high cycle pressures. In general, large temperature glides at condensing pressures extend the heat recovery into the two-phase dome, which is an advantage. However, at the same time, the shift of <b>the</b> <b>pinch</b> <b>point</b> towards the warm end of the regenerator is found to be a major cause of irreversibility. In fact, as the number of carbon atoms in alkanes decreases, their blend with CO 2 moves <b>the</b> <b>pinch</b> <b>point</b> to the colder end of the regenerator. This results in lower entropy generation in the regenerator and improved cycle efficiency of propane + CO 2 mixtures. With this mixture, real cycle efficiencies of 15 - 18 % are achievable at a moderate source temperature of 573 K. Applicability for a wide range of source temperatures is found to be an added advantage of this mixture...|$|E
40|$|In synthesizing optimal heat {{recovery}} networks, Composite Curve (CC) plots and Problem Table Algorithms (PTAs) {{have been the}} most popular tools for determining the minimum energy targets, whereas Grid Diagrams (GDs) have been widely utilized for heat exchanger network (HEN) design.

40|$|International audienceThe {{mathematics}} of gauge theories {{lies behind}} {{many of the}} most profound advances in physics in the past 200 years, from Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism to Einstein's theory of general relativity. More recently it has become clear that gauge theories also emerge in condensed matter, a prime example being the spin-ice materials which host an emergent electromagnetic gauge field. In spin-ice, the underlying gauge structure is revealed by the presence of pinch-point singularities in neutron-scattering measurements. Here we report the discovery of a spin-liquid where the low-temperature physics is naturally described by the fluctuations of a tensor field with a continuous gauge freedom. This gauge structure underpins an unusual form of spin correlations, giving rise to pinch-line singularities: line-like analogues of <b>the</b> <b>pinch</b> <b>points</b> observed in spin-ice.
