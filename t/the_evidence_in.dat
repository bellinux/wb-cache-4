5|$|Confident {{that the}} results of the 1795 {{election}} would be reversed, Benjamin Logan was the first to declare his candidacy for the governorship in 1799. Garrard and Thomas Todd declared their respective candidacies soon after. Former U.S. Representative Christopher Greenup also sought the office. Many of the recent settlers in Kentucky were unaware of his illustrious military record and unimpressed with his unsophisticated speaking skills. Although the candidates themselves rarely spoke negatively of each other, opponents of each candidate independently raised issues that they felt would hurt that candidate. John Breckinridge, Garrard's long-time political nemesis, tried to goad Garrard into making another impassioned plea for emancipation of slaves, which was a minority position in the state, but Garrard recognized Breckinridge's tactics and refused to express any bold emancipationist sentiments during the campaign. The fact that the slavery protections in the new constitution were even stronger than those in the previous document ensured that the incumbent's previous anti-slavery sentiments were not a major concern to most of the electorate. The family of Henry Field, a prominent leader in Frankfort, attacked Garrard for not issuing a pardon for Field, who was convicted of murdering his wife with an ax. After examining <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> the case, Garrard concluded that the verdict was reached justly and without undue outside influence, but the charge was raised so late in the campaign that Garrard's defense of his refusal to issue a pardon could not be circulated widely.|$|E

25|$|The {{comparative}} {{efficacy of}} duloxetine and established pain-relief medications for DPN is unclear. A systematic review noted that tricyclic antidepressants (imipramine and amitriptyline), traditional anticonvulsants and opioids have better efficacy than duloxetine. Duloxetine, tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants have similar tolerability while the opioids caused more side effects. Another review in Prescrire International considered the moderate pain relief achieved with duloxetine to be clinically insignificant {{and the results}} of the clinical trials unconvincing. The reviewer saw no reason to prescribe duloxetine in practice. The comparative data collected by reviewers in BMC Neurology indicated that amitriptyline, other tricyclic antidepressants and venlafaxine may be more effective. However, the authors noted that <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> favor of duloxetine is much more solid. A Cochrane review concluded that <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> support of duloxetine's efficacy in treating painful diabetic neuropathy was adequate, and that further trials should focus on comparisons with other medications.|$|E

Vincent Courtillot analyses <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> for cataclysmic geological change. Monica Grady considers <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> for life <b>in</b> space. Brian Greene discusses superstring theory and the quest for a unified theory of the universe. Philip Dawid explores the uses and abuses of statistical <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> landmark legal cases while Cherie Booth looks at <b>the</b> role of <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> domestic and international law.

25|$|Shankar also appealed on {{the ground}} that the Disciplinary Committee, by virtue of its {{excessive}} intervention in the case, had descended into the arena and adopted an inquisitorial role, which had impaired its judgment and ability to properly evaluate and weigh <b>the</b> <b>evidence.</b> <b>In</b> addressing this submission, Judicial Commissioner Menon noted that this was a wholly separate ground of appeal, although it often overlaps with the issue of apparent bias and courts do not always distinguish the two.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> {{the ancient}} sources {{does not make}} clear how the {{relation}} between the two principles should be understood.

This implies a monistic interpretation of the two principles and fits with assertions in the dialogues that suggest a monistic philosophy. Plato's Meno says that everything in nature is related, and the Republic states that there is an origin (archḗ) for all things, which can be grasped by reason.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{into the}} neurodevelopmental and {{neurodegenerative}} aspects of schizophrenia {{have led to}} the use of lesion models to investigate these aspects. A lesion is damage to an area of tissue by any cause. The evidence for the neurodegenerative theory is a reduction in the volume of the cerebral cortex and an increase in the volumes of the ventricles (cavities in the brain containing cerebrospinal fluid) associated with schizophrenia. Most neurodegenerative diseases produce increased levels of glial cells such as astrocytes, this is not found in schizophrenia. <b>The</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> favour of the neurodevelopmental theory includes the connection of some physical abnormalities with schizophrenia.|$|E

25|$|Dog {{fighting}} is a felony in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. While dog fighting statutes exist independently of general anti-cruelty statutes and carry stiffer penalties than general state anti-cruelty statutes, {{a person can}} be charged under both or can be charged under one, but not the other—depending on <b>the</b> <b>evidence.</b> <b>In</b> addition to felony charges for dog fighting, forty-eight states and the District of Columbia, have provisions within their dogfighting statutes that explicitly prohibit attendance as a spectator at a dogfighting exhibition. Since Montana and Hawaii do not have such provisions, a person can pay an entrance fee to watch a dog-fight in either state and not be convicted under these statutes. Additionally, forty-six states, and the District of Columbia, make possessing, owning or keeping a fighting dog a felony.|$|E
25|$|Australian {{architectural}} historian John James, {{who made}} a detailed study of the cathedral, has estimated that there were about 300 men working on the site at any one time, although {{it has to be}} acknowledged that current knowledge of working practices at this time is somewhat limited.
