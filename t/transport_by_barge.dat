50|$|Contargo {{was founded}} in 2004, {{bundling}} the activities of various enterprises in container hinterland logistics, some {{of which had been}} active since 1976 in combined <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> <b>barge</b> and truck and the operation of container terminals.|$|E
5000|$|Construction of Ferrybridge A {{power station}} began in 1926 and the station began {{operating}} in 1927. The initial station covered 32 acre of the site. The main buildings contained the boilers, turbines, and offices and workshops, {{and a smaller}} building housed the electrical switchgear. Transport facilities included sidings connected to the LNER with equipment for handling wagons up to 20t, and a river wharf for <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> <b>barge.</b> Wagon unloading was by a side tipper, into an automated weigher and then conveyors, and barge unloading was by a crane into the weighing machine. The cooling water intakes were 550 ft [...] of the wharves, initially with two filtered intakes with a minimum capacity (low water) of 3000000 imp gal of water per hour.|$|E
5000|$|The {{name comes}} from the SiLozi for quench the fire, {{referring}} to nearby rapids in the Zambezi). [...] From early days (and {{before the advent of}} fire-lighting matches), there was river <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> <b>barge</b> (propelled by paddlers) along the Zambesi from Livingstone to Sesheke, on past the Ngonye Falls at Sioma, where an attempt was made in about 1905 to bypass the Falls with a canal.; barges were unloaded and dragged by oxen round the Falls. The route continued to Mongu, the administrative capital of Barotseland, and on Northwards to the settlement of Balovale (now Zambesi) in the North West of Zambia, at -13.550879, 23.115341. When the barge reached Katima Mulilo, the fire was extinguished (but embers kept), and the barge was unloaded and then dragged empty up the rapids, and re-loaded before continuing the journey - but not before the fire was re-lit.|$|E

5000|$|St. Andrew's Church {{originally}} {{stood on}} the site of the Church Missionary Society's Paihia Mission Station. [...] In 1927 the building was <b>transported</b> <b>by</b> <b>barge</b> and bullock waggon to its present site.|$|R
50|$|From Pauillac, the A380 {{parts are}} <b>transported</b> <b>by</b> <b>barge</b> through {{the centre of}} Bordeaux on the River Garonne. The barges carry the parts to Langon, where a special dock has been built to permit the {{offloading}} of the barges.|$|R
40|$|The {{problems}} of transporting {{nuclear power plant}} components to landlocked sites where the usual mode of <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> <b>barge</b> cannot be used are considered. Existing methods of ground-based overland transport are discussed and their costs presented. Components are described and traffic density projections made to the year 2000. Plots of units transported versus distance transported are provided for units booked in 1973 and booked and proposed in 1974. It is shown that, for these cases, overland transport requirements for the industry will be over 5, 000, 000 ton-miles/year while a projection based on increasing energy demands shows that this figure will increase significantly by the year 2000. The payload size, distances, and costs of existing overland modes are significant enough to consider development of a lighter than air (LTA) mode for transporting NSSS components...|$|E
30|$|To include {{transport}} prices, a {{price index}} comparing the cheapest intermodal {{route to the}} cheapest unimodal road transport route is created. The lower this index the higher the affinity for a modal shift will be. These prices are calculated using the LAMBIT model, developed by Macharis [39]. LAMBIT is a Geographic Information Systems-based model that calculates the cheapest transport alternatives based on a cheapest path algorithm, which {{is comparable to the}} shortest path algorithm developed by Dijkstra [43]. The model thus uses the existing networks of the different transport modes to calculate cheapest transport routes for all modal alternatives. These include the origin and destination locations, the road and inland waterways networks and the inland terminals which allow switching between modes. Rail transport networks can also be included but were not relevant for the case study described below. In the case study, the center points of the municipalities in the research area, as proxy for the complete entity, and the geographic center of the Port of Antwerp are considered as origins or destinations of the transport flows. The routes between origin and destinations are calculated based on distance-depended price functions which are derived from surveys. The function used for the intermodal transport simulations consists of a fixed component (e.g. transshipment prices) and two variable components, which are dependent on the distance of the main haul <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> <b>barge</b> and of the distance of the post-haul transport by truck. For transport between a port and its hinterland, the model will calculate the cheapest transport alternative by road transport and by intermodal barge transport. By comparing these prices per geographic entity (e.g. municipalities), the price index is calculated. LAMBIT has been used and tested previously to calculate the impact of policy measures on transport prices and on the market area of intermodal terminals (e.g. [18, 20]) and to determine the optimal location for new intermodal terminals [44]. The calculation of the price ratio on municipal level is described in Pekin et al. [45]. For the case study described below, the model was geographically extended to include the neighboring countries of Belgium.|$|E
5000|$|Initially, the {{railroad}} had no connections to other lines. All {{equipment and materials}} were <b>transported</b> <b>by</b> <b>barge</b> to Nolan's Point, where {{the railroad}} machine shops were located. The railroad operated its own steamship to tow barges across the lake.|$|R
5000|$|The {{floating}} platform was towed to Murmansk in Russia where the topsides facilities and main hull were de-mated. Subsequently the topsides were <b>transported</b> <b>by</b> <b>barge</b> to the Sevmash fabrication yard at Severodvinsk, {{where they were}} temporarily stored while undergoing refurbishment and refitting.|$|R
50|$|Sacred Heart Church is a Roman Catholic {{church that}} serves as the parish church of St Ives, Cambridgeshire.

50|$|Starting in Hamburg-Finkenwerder on the River Elbe, {{the ship}} loads {{the front and}} rear {{sections}} of the fuselage, from where they are shipped to the United Kingdom. The wings, which are manufactured at Filton in Bristol and Broughton, Flintshire in North Wales, are <b>transported</b> <b>by</b> <b>barge</b> to Mostyn docks, where the ship adds them to its cargo. In Saint-Nazaire in western France, the ship trades the fuselage sections from Hamburg for larger, assembled sections, some of which include the nose. The ship unloads in Bordeaux. Afterwards, the ship picks up the belly and tail sections by Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA in Cádiz in southern Spain, and delivers them to Bordeaux. From there, the A380 parts are <b>transported</b> <b>by</b> <b>barge</b> to Langon, and by the oversize road convoys of the Itinéraire à Grand Gabarit from there to the assembly hall in Toulouse.|$|R
50|$|The {{town was}} {{initially}} {{laid out in}} 1833, and incorporated March 3, 1848. West Elizabeth was a coal mining and boat-building town. Coal was <b>transported</b> <b>by</b> <b>barge</b> down the Monongahela River to industries in Pittsburgh. Coal was transported from the mine to the river by Walton's Coal Incline and the O'Neil and Company Incline.|$|R
50|$|When Hastings Mill closed, the {{building}} that housed the Hastings Mill Store was <b>transported</b> <b>by</b> <b>barge</b> {{to the foot of}} Alma Street to begin a new life as the Old Hastings Mill Store Museum.

500|$|Preparatory work on {{the bridge}} started in July 1959. The bridge was built using {{suspended}} construction, which involved building two [...] concrete towers with support cables over these. Hangers were attached to these cables and the road deck was <b>transported</b> <b>by</b> <b>barge</b> and lifted into place. Cleveland Bridge and Engineering later used the same technique to construct the first Severn Bridge.|$|R
50|$|The bridge also {{incorporates}} a 3% climbing grade, a feature lacked {{on the nearby}} St. Georges Bridge. The bridge, built between 1991 and 1994, utilized pre-cast concrete segments that were made in Cape Charles, Virginia, and <b>transported</b> <b>by</b> <b>barge</b> until it reached the job site. Once at the site, the segments were fitted into place {{like that of a}} jigsaw puzzle.|$|R
5000|$|The Landon House was {{originally}} built in 1754 near the Rappahannock River in Virginia.

He sends a force, borne by half a dozen large ship's boats, to try to blow up the barges and ammunition. He puts his best friend, Captain William Bush, in command. The raid is a success and the French force is stopped, but an {{unexpected}} explosion kills most of the British, including Bush.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of the Tarkhankut lighthouse and its twin tower on the Khersones peninsula started in 1816 to ensure safe sailing in the area. The Inkerman stone, of which the building is made, was mined near Sevastopol and <b>transported</b> <b>by</b> <b>barges.</b> No convenient mooring facilities existed at that time, so the barges had to anchor in the harbor and the load {{was moved to the}} shore by boats and then transported to the construction site across the steppe.|$|R
5000|$|A monolithic, 21 ft {{rocket motor}} was designed, which {{was too big}} to be <b>transported</b> <b>by</b> rail. A plan was devised where the rocket motors would be <b>transported</b> <b>by</b> <b>barge</b> to Cape Canaveral. To {{facilitate}} barges, a canal was dug (C-111) and a drawbridge installed for the U.S. Highway 1 crossing at mile marker 116 (...) [...] This canal became the southernmost freshwater canal in Southeast Florida and was dubbed the [...] "Aerojet Canal". A concrete silo was constructed for the rocket motor, 180 feet deep into the Everglades.|$|R
50|$|The first {{nuclear reactor}} {{produced}} by Atommash after a 29-year long hiatus was a VVER-1200, for the Belarusian nuclear power plant. According to press reports, it took 840 days (2 years and 4 months) {{to build the}} reactor; it was shipped from Atommash on October 14, 2015. After being <b>transported</b> <b>by</b> <b>barge</b> over the Tsimlyansk Reservoir, the Volga-Don Canal, the Volga-Baltic Waterway, and the Volkhov River to Novgorod, the reactor was then shipped by a special rail car to Belarus.|$|R
2500|$|Montferrand {{designed}} the {{monument to the}} late Alexander I as a column, crowned with a cross; later, he changed the cross to an angel. The cost was estimated at 1.2 million roubles.

50|$|The {{front and}} rear {{sections}} of the fuselage are loaded aboard one of the fleet in Hamburg in northern Germany, from where they are shipped to the United Kingdom. The wings, which are manufactured at Filton in Bristol and Broughton in North Wales, are <b>transported</b> <b>by</b> <b>barge</b> on the River Dee to Mostyn docks, where the ship adds them to its cargo. The Ciudad de Cadiz went aground without cargo on sandbanks outside Mostyn in January 2013, when its moorings burst during high winds.|$|R
50|$|At Tveitsund, {{the railway}} corresponded with the ferry Nissen and Dølen, which ran on Nisser. The Nissedal Municipal Council {{stated that the}} {{location}} of the station was problematic, as it was located {{on the south side of}} the river, while most access was from the north side. A bridge across the river was therefore built and opened in 1918. In 1916, a mine was opened at Søftestad on Nisser. The ore was <b>transported</b> <b>by</b> <b>barge</b> down the lake and transshipped to the railway. The passenger service with Dølen on Nisser was terminated in 1937.|$|R
50|$|For {{the surface}} {{movement}} of large A380 structural components, a complex route {{known as the}} Itinéraire à Grand Gabarit was developed. This involved {{the construction of a}} fleet of roll-on/roll-off (RORO) ships and barges, the construction of port facilities and the development of new and modified roads to accommodate oversized road convoys. The front and rear fuselage sections are shipped on one of three RORO ships from Hamburg in northern Germany to the United Kingdom. The wings are manufactured at Broughton in North Wales, then <b>transported</b> <b>by</b> <b>barge</b> to Mostyn docks for ship transport.|$|R
