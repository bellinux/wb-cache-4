40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare lower {{extremity}} muscle activity and power output during cycling outdoors overground and cycling on a stationary bike trainer at different self-perceived intensity levels. Recreational and competitive cyclists and triathletes, eight male (48. 6 ± 8. 7 years, 178. 9 ± 7. 8 cm, 87. 1 ± 8. 3 kg) and three female (40. 3 ± 6. 8 years, 158 ± 1 cm, 59. 6 ± 9. 3 kg), signed institutionally approved informed consents and participated in this study. Power data were collected using power instrumented bicycle pedals (PowerTap, Madison, WI) attached to the cyclist’s bicycle. Muscle activity was recorded using wireless electromyography (Delsys, Inc., Natick, MA) sampling at 1926 Hz. Participants were tested for maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) for all muscles tested: the rectus femoris, biceps femoris, vastus lateralis, gluteus maximus, and gastrocnemius. MVIC data were used to normalize electromyography (EMG) from each cycling condition. Participants were instructed to complete four-minute cycling trials at different self-perceived intensity levels (RPE 11, RPE 13, RPE 15) during overground and stationary cycling. For overground cycling, participants rode around a pre-marked, 400 -m loop. For stationary cycling, participant’s bicycles were fixed to a stationary bike trainer. During each condition, participants continuously pedaled for two minutes, then were instructed to coast for two seconds. They then resumed cycling for another two minutes. EMG data were processed by correcting for any zero offset, full-wave rectifying the data, and normalizing to MVIC. The two second pause was visually identified, then a twenty second average for each muscle was calculated following <b>the</b> <b>pause.</b> <b>Power</b> data were also visually inspected, and the two second pause was identified. A twenty second average was calculated for power output following the pause. A 2 (stationary versus overground) x 3 (RPE) repeated measures ANOVA was run for each dependent variable (α= 0. 05). The statistical analysis was completed using SPSS statistical software (v 24). Power output did not differ between overground and stationary, regardless of intensity (p 3 ̆e 0. 05). However, power output increased as intensity increased, regardless of mode (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). There was no significant difference between overground and stationary cycling for the rectus femoris, regardless of intensity (p 3 ̆e 0. 05). Muscle activity significantly increased as RPE level increased, regardless of mode (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Biceps femoris muscle activity was influenced by the interaction of mode and intensity. Using post hoc testing, it was determined that muscle activity increased as intensity increased during stationary cycling (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). However, there was no significant difference in muscle activity between modes of cycling and no change in activity as RPE level increased (p 3 ̆e 0. 05). There was no significant difference between overground and stationary cycling for vastus lateralis muscle activity (p 3 ̆e 0. 05). Muscle activity increased as RPE level increased, regardless of mode (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Gluteus maximus activity was significantly greater during overground cycling than stationary cycling, regardless of intensity (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Muscle activity also increased as self-selected intensity increased, regardless of mode (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). There was no significant difference between mode of cycling for gastrocnemius (p 3 ̆e 0. 05). Muscle activity increased as RPE level increased (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). The results of this study show that hip extensor and knee flexor muscles have unique responses between submaximal overground and stationary cycling...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{describe}} the kinematics of escape jumps in three species of 0. 3 – 3. 0 mm-sized planktonic copepods. We find similar kinematics between species with periodically alternating power strokes and passive coasting and a resulting highly fluctuating escape velocity. By direct numerical simulations, we estimate {{the force and}} power output needed to accelerate and overcome drag. Both are very high {{compared with those of}} other organisms, as are the escape velocities in comparison to startle velocities of other aquatic animals. Thus, the maximum weight-specific force, which for muscle motors of other animals {{has been found to be}} near constant at 57 N (kg muscle) − 1, is more than an order of magnitude higher for the escaping copepods. We argue that this is feasible because most copepods have different systems for steady propulsion (feeding appendages) and intensive escapes (swimming legs), with the muscular arrangement of the latter probably adapted for high force production during short-lasting bursts. The resulting escape velocities scale with body length to power 0. 65, different from the size-scaling of both similar sized and larger animals moving at constant velocity, but similar to that found for startle velocities in other aquatic organisms. The relative duration of <b>the</b> <b>pauses</b> between <b>power</b> strokes was observed to increase with organism size. We demonstrate that this is an inherent property of swimming by alternating <b>power</b> strokes and <b>pauses.</b> We finally show that the Strouhal number is in the range of peak propulsion efficiency, again suggesting that copepods are optimally designed for rapid escape jumps...|$|R
40|$|Frontal beta {{oscillations}} {{are associated}} with top-down control mechanisms but also change over time during a task. It is unclear whether change over time represents another control function or a neural instantiation of vigilance decrements over time, the time-on-task effect. We investigated how frontal beta oscillations are modulated by cognitive control and time. We used frontal chronic electrocorticography in monkeys performing a trial-and-error task, comprising search and repetition phases. Specific beta oscillations in the delay period of each trial were modulated by task phase and adaptation to feedback. Beta oscillations in this same period showed a significant within-session change. These separate modulations of beta oscillations did not interact. Crucially, and in contrast to previous investigations, we examined modulations of beta around spontaneous pauses in work. After <b>pauses,</b> <b>the</b> beta <b>power</b> modulation was reset and the cognitive control effect was maintained. Cognitive performance was also maintained whereas behavioral signs of fatigue continued to increase. We propose that these beta oscillations reflect multiple factors contributing to the regulation of cognitive control. Due to <b>the</b> effect of <b>pauses,</b> <b>the</b> time-sensitive factor cannot be a neural correlate of time-on-task but may reflect attentional effort...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} study, we {{examined}} <b>the</b> <b>pause</b> length which <b>the</b> storyteller sets at each sentence boundary {{in the story}} text to support children’s comprehension and proposed one method of estimating <b>the</b> <b>pause</b> length preliminarily {{to apply to the}} speech synthesis. While reading the story text, the reader constructs the situation model that is the mental microworld described in each sentence. Unlike the reader who can read the text at his own pace, however, the listener must hear the story at the storyteller’s reading pace. Therefore we assumed that the experienced storyteller can set <b>the</b> <b>pause</b> length at each sentence boundary necessary for the listener to construct the situation model. If the listener is a young child, this assumption is true. Then we focused on the relationship between the mental operations for constructing the situation model and <b>the</b> <b>pause</b> length set by the experienced storyteller to help the listener comprehend the story. Specifically, we devised a knowledge representation with multilayered frame structure corresponding to the situation model to predict the mental operations for constructing the situation model. The knowledge representation was named as the situation frame. The results indicated that the storyteller controlled <b>the</b> <b>pause</b> length on <b>the</b> basis of several operations. The formula, that can estimate <b>the</b> <b>pause</b> length from <b>the</b> operation needed to construct the situation frame, seems to provide us the reasonable method to determine <b>the</b> <b>pause</b> length in <b>the</b> synthesized speech preliminarily...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} study of silent speech pauses at three {{different}} speaking rates, based on the analysis of four hours of read speech in six European languages. Our results confirm earlier observations by Campione et al. [1] that the logarithmic duration of <b>the</b> <b>pauses</b> can be well approximated by a bi-Gaussian distribution and we found this also to be true at slow and fast speaking rates. Our analysis further shows that, as far as <b>the</b> long speech <b>pauses</b> are concerned, similar strategies for speaking slowly or rapidly are used in all languages considered. For speaking slowly, speakers increase {{the total amount of}} pauses and they effectively use a wider range of pause durations. Overall, however, besides using more pauses, there appeared to be no striking change in <b>the</b> average <b>pause</b> duration, nor in the variance of the distribution of <b>the</b> <b>pause</b> durations. For speaking rapidly, speakers decrease <b>the</b> amount of <b>pauses</b> used and they refrain from using <b>the</b> longest <b>pauses</b> that occur in their normal speech. Overall, this results in a lower average duration of <b>the</b> <b>pauses</b> and a smaller variance of <b>the</b> <b>pause</b> durations. 1...|$|R
