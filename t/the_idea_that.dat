5|$|Another {{possibility}} {{was suggested}} by Brooks: Penda might have lost power {{at some point}} after Heavenfield, and Eowa may have actually been ruling the Mercians {{for at least some}} of the period as a subject ally or puppet of Oswald. Brooks cited Bede's statement implying that Penda's fortunes were mixed during his 22 years in power and noted the possibility that Penda's fortunes were low at this time. Thus it may be that Penda was not consistently the dominant figure in Mercia during the years between Hatfield and Maserfield. argues against <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> Penda and Eowa were co-rulers, and favours <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> Eowa was ruling Mercia from c. 635 until 642.|$|E

5|$|Later Reformed theologians reacted against Barth's {{views on}} baptism by {{appealing}} to Calvin, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> baptism is a promise rather than an accomplished reality, {{and the idea of}} baptism as a replacement of circumcision. Scottish Reformed theologian T.F. Torrance emphasized <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> baptism is God's word establishing the church, and that the individual's response comes after rather than before God's act in baptism. German Reformed liberation theologian Jürgen Moltmann, on the other hand, saw infant baptism as inappropriately associated with the national church. He saw baptism as properly a free response God's call to discipleship. Reformed churches have generally maintained the practice of infant baptism despite these critiques.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately, Palmer endorses the no-contact {{version of}} the LFI.

She then deploys this philosophy in a number of imagined cases in which humans have varying relations to particular animals in need.
