5|$|Both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles {{are clearly}} visible by {{microscopy}} in brains of those afflicted by AD. Plaques are dense, mostly insoluble deposits of beta-amyloid peptide and cellular material outside and around neurons. Tangles (neurofibrillary tangles) are aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau {{which has become}} hyperphosphorylated and accumulate inside the cells themselves. Although many older individuals develop some plaques and tangles {{as a consequence of}} ageing, <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of people with AD have a greater number of them in specific brain regions such as the temporal lobe. Lewy bodies are not rare in <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of people with AD.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>brains</b> {{of humans}} and other {{primates}} contain the same structures as <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of other mammals, but are generally larger in proportion to body size. The encephalization quotient (EQ) is used to compare brain sizes across species. It {{takes into account the}} nonlinearity of the brain-to-body relationship. Humans have an average EQ in the 7-to-8 range, while most other primates have an EQ in the 2-to-3 range. Dolphins have values higher than those of primates other than humans, but nearly all other mammals have EQ values that are substantially lower.|$|E
25|$|The CSF that is {{produced}} in the ventricular system is also necessary for chemical stability, {{and the provision of}} nutrients needed by <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b> <b>The</b> CSF helps to protect <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> from jolts and knocks to the head and also provides buoyancy and support to <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> against gravity. (Since <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> and CSF are similar in density, <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> floats in neutral buoyancy, suspended in the CSF.) This allows <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> to grow in size and weight without resting {{on the floor of the}} cranium, which would destroy nervous tissue.|$|R

5|$|Slow lorises have a {{round head}} because their skull is shorter {{than in other}} living strepsirrhine. Like other lorisids, its snout does not taper towards {{the front of the}} face as it does in lemurs, making the face appear less long and pointed. Compared to the slender lorises, the snout of the slow loris is even less pointed. As with other members of Lorisidae, its interorbital {{distance}} is shorter than in lemurs. The skull has prominent crests (ridges of bone). A distinguishing feature of the slow loris skull is that the occipital bone is flattened and faces backward. The foramen magnum (hole through which the spinal cord enters) faces directly backward. <b>The</b> <b>brains</b> of slow lorises have more folds (convolutions) than <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of galagos.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>brains</b> of {{all species}} are {{composed}} primarily of two broad classes of cells: neurons and glial cells. Glial cells (also known as glia or neuroglia) come in several types, and perform {{a number of}} critical functions, including structural support, metabolic support, insulation, and guidance of development. Neurons, however, are usually considered the most important cells in the brain.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>brains</b> {{of common}} ravens count {{among the largest}} of any bird species. Specifically, their hyperpallium is large, for a bird. They display ability in problem-solving, {{as well as other}} {{cognitive}} processes such as imitation and insight.|$|E
50|$|Bassett and {{her team}} have also been {{conducting}} research regarding brain flexibility. Brain flexibility is how often a region of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> switches communication patterns. The more often <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> switches patterns, <b>the</b> more flexible <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> is. They have also found correlations between the ability for <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> to learn and the flexibility of <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b> Her research may have implications in rehabilitation, particularly in patients {{who have had a}} stroke.|$|R
50|$|The {{creatine}} phosphate {{system is}} needed for the storage and transmission of phosphate-bound energy in <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> and muscle. <b>The</b> <b>brain</b> and muscle have particularly high metabolic demands, therefore, making creatine a necessary molecule in ATP homeostasis. In regard to <b>the</b> <b>brain,</b> in order for creatine to reach <b>the</b> <b>brain,</b> it must first pass through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB separates blood from brain interstitial fluid and is, therefore, able to regulate the transfer of nutrients to <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> from <b>the</b> blood. In order {{to pass through the}} BBB, creatine utilizes creatine transporter (CRT). When present at the BBB, CRT mediates the passage of creatine from the blood to <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b> When being transported from the blood to <b>the</b> <b>brain,</b> creatine has to constantly move against the creatine concentration gradient that is present at the border between <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> and circulating blood.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>brain,</b> {{although}} {{protected by}} the blood-brain barrier, can be affected by infections including viruses, bacteria and fungi. Infection may be of the meninges (meningitis), <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> matter (encephalitis), or within <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> matter (such as a cerebral abscess). Rare prion diseases including Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and its variant, and kuru may also affect <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{most obvious}} {{difference}} between <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of mammals and other vertebrates is {{in terms of}} size. On average, a mammal has a brain roughly twice as large as that of a bird of the same body size, and ten times as large as that of a reptile of the same body size.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{brain to}} have been {{discovered}} was in Armenia in the Areni-1 cave complex. The brain, estimated to be over 5,000 years old, {{was found in the}} skull of a 12 to 14-year-old girl. Although <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> were shriveled, they were well preserved due to the climate found inside the cave.|$|E
5|$|During phylogenesis, {{cerebrospinal}} fluid is present within the neuraxis before it circulates. The CSF of Teleostei fish are {{contained within the}} ventricles of <b>the</b> <b>brains,</b> {{but not in a}} nonexistent subarachnoid space. In mammals, where a subarachnoid space is present, the CSF is present in it. Absorption of CSF is seen in amniotes and more complex species, and as species become progressively more complex, the system of absorption becomes progressively more enhanced, and the role of spinal epidural veins in absorption plays a progressively smaller and smaller role.|$|E

40|$|Other {{researchers}} {{have proposed that}} <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> parenchymal fraction (or brain atrophy) {{may be a good}} surrogate measure for disease progression in patients with Multiple Sclerosis. This paper considers various factors influencing the measure of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> parenchymal fraction obtained from dual spin-echo PD and T 2 -weighted head MRI scans. The robustness of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> parenchymal fraction is evaluated with respect to processing parameters such as the placement of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> mask border, which determines <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> intra-dural volume. An automatic segmentation method for <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> and for <b>the</b> cerebral spinal fluid is evaluated and the sensitivity of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> atrophy measure to various segmentation parameters is measured.

5|$|Expression of Hsp90A also {{correlates}} with disease prognosis. Increased levels of Hsp90A {{are found in}} leukemia, breast and pancreatic cancers {{as well as in}} patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In human T-cells, HSP90AA1 expression is increased by the cytokines IL-2, IL-4 and IL-13. HSP90, alongside other conserved chaperones and co-chaperones that interact to safeguard proteostasis, is repressed in aging human brains. This repression was found to be further exacerbated in <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of patients with age-onset neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Huntington's disease.|$|E
5|$|Little {{was known}} about {{the cause of the}} disease until 1903 when Adelchi Negri (1876–1912) first saw {{microscopic}} lesions– now called Negri bodies– in <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of rabid animals. He wrongly thought they were protozoan parasites. Paul Remlinger (1871–1964) soon showed by filtration experiments that they were much smaller than protozoa, and even smaller than bacteria. Thirty years later, Negri bodies were shown to be accumulations of particles 100–150nanometres long, now known to be the size of rhabdovirus particles– the virus that causes rabies.|$|E

5|$|Two {{groups of}} {{invertebrates}} have notably complex brains: arthropods (insects, crustaceans, arachnids, and others), and cephalopods (octopuses, squids, and similar molluscs). <b>The</b> <b>brains</b> of arthropods and cephalopods arise from twin parallel nerve cords that extend {{through the body}} of the animal. Arthropods have a central brain, the supraesophageal ganglion, with three divisions and large optical lobes behind each eye for visual processing. Cephalopods such as the octopus and squid have the largest brains of any invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Unlike their {{toothed whale}} counterparts, baleen whales {{are hard to}} study because of their immense size. Intelligence tests such as the mirror test cannot be done because their bulk and lack of body {{language}} makes a reaction impossible to be definitive. However, studies on <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of humpback whales revealed spindle cells, which, in humans, control theory of mind. Because of this, {{it is thought that}} baleen whales, or at least humpback whales, have consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales have a {{relatively}} small brain compared to their body mass. Like other mammals, their brain has a large, folded cerebrum, {{the part of the}} brain responsible for memory and processing sensory information. Their cerebrum only makes up about 68% of their brain's weight, as opposed to human's 83%. The cerebellum, {{the part of the brain}} responsible for balance and coordination, makes up 18% of their brain's weight, compared to 10% in humans, which is probably due to the great degree of control necessary for constantly swimming. Necropsies on <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of gray whales revealed iron oxide particles, which may allow them to find magnetic north like a compass.|$|E
5000|$|Furthermore, {{tracing the}} outflow of {{compounds}} injected into <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> parenchyma indicated that meningeal lymphatics function downstream of the glymphatic system.

5000|$|Cerebral contusions are bruises to <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> {{caused by}} a direct {{blow to the head}} causing <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> to bounce against the inside of the skull and bruise <b>brain</b> tissue.

5|$|He was {{particularly}} interested in dementia praecox (which he favored renaming schizophrenia), and found diffuse anatomic differences in <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of schizophrenic patients. These changes were ignored or dismissed as artifactual by other investigators for several decades. Serious attention to Southard's findings did not reemerge in the medical literature until the 1990s, but changes in diagnostic criteria complicate the application of Southard's findings to modern schizophrenic patients. Shortly before his death Southard wrote and presented Non-dementia non-praecox: note on the advantages to mental hygiene of extirpating a term, but did not live to see it published.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{scientists}} reconstructed an endocast (replica) of an Acrocanthosaurus {{cranial cavity}} using computed tomography (CT scanning) {{to analyze the}} spaces within the holotype braincase (OMNH 10146). In life, much of this space would have been filled with the meninges and cerebrospinal fluid, {{in addition to the}} brain itself. However, the general features of the brain and cranial nerves could be determined from the endocast and compared to other theropods for which endocasts have been created. While the brain is similar to many theropods, it is most similar to that of allosauroids. It most resembles <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of Carcharodontosaurus and Giganotosaurus rather than those of Allosaurus or Sinraptor, providing support for the hypothesis that Acrocanthosaurus was a carcharodontosaurid.|$|E
5|$|Many {{months before}} the coup, Đông had met Diệm's brother and adviser Ngô Đình Nhu, widely {{regarded}} as <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of the regime, to ask for reform and de-politicisation of the army.

However, a few weeks later, Dong and his collaborators were transferred to different commands and physically separated. Fearing that Diệm and Nhu were trying to throw their plans off balance, they accelerated their planning work, and decided to move on October 6. However, they were then scheduled to go into battle against the communists near Kon Tum in the II Corps in the Central Highlands, forcing a postponement. According to the historian George McTurnan Kahin, Đông was without a command {{by the time the}} coup was held.|$|E
