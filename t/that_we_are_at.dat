One road already appears clearly laid out, at least in its general orientation. That's the road {{of the loss of}} meaning, of the repetition of empty forms, of conformism, apathy, irresponsibility, and cynicism {{at the same time as}} it is that of the tightening grip of the capitalist imaginary of unlimited expansion of [...] "rational mastery," [...] pseudorational pseudomastery, of an unlimited expansion of consumption for the sake of consumption, that is to say, for nothing, and of a technoscience that has become autonomized along its path and that is evidently involved in the domination of this capitalist imaginary.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "English Socialism" [...] has {{precedents}} in his wartime writings; in {{the essay}} [...] "" [...] (1941), he said that [...] "the war and the revolution are inseparable...the fact <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> war has turned Socialism from a textbook word into a realisable policy"– because Britain's superannuated social class system hindered the war effort and only a socialist economy would defeat Adolf Hitler. Given the middle class's grasping this, they too would abide socialist revolution and that only reactionary Britons would oppose it, thus limiting the force revolutionaries would need to take power. An English Socialism would come about which [...] "will never lose touch with the tradition of compromise and the belief in a law that is above the State. It will shoot traitors, but it will give them a solemn trial beforehand and occasionally it will acquit them. It will crush any open revolt promptly and cruelly, but it will interfere very little with the spoken and written word." ...|$|E

Not only the first game, because {{that could have been}} an accident – with the weather conditions etc. No, the performance we achieved in Liverpool under bad circumstances – I've never seen such a hectic situation. <b>We</b> drew <b>that</b> game 2–2 and never really had problems.

50|$|El Jaleo is {{the most}} {{theatrical}} of Sargent's early major works.

500|$|The match {{has been}} cited as a pivotal turning point in English football. Author Jason Cowley noted how instead of rioting, as had {{occurred}} at Heysel with fatal consequences, Liverpool fans stayed on after the game and applauded Arsenal [...] "as if they understood <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> the start of something new; {{that there would be}} no returning to the ways of old". Cowley describes the match as [...] "the night football was reborn" [...] and that the event [...] "repaired the reputation of football". Dominic Fifield suggested Arsenal's win [...] "had shattered the myth that Liverpool were invincible," [...] while Si Hughes in The Daily Telegraph wrote it [...] "...set in motion the decline of one of football’s grandest institutions." ...|$|R

All the staff were invited, and before we started our festive meal he would give a speech in two parts—in the first, he told us we had all done well but <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could have done better, and, in the second, he announced <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> a crucial point for the coming year and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had to take great care to avoid spoiling everything we had achieved up till then.

25|$|At Cabinet on {{the morning}} of 30 October Lloyd {{reported}} that the USA was ready to move a motion at the UN condemning Israel, which had attacked Egypt in the Sinai the previous day, as an aggressor. Macleod and Heathcoat Amory approved of Lloyd's suggestion of postponing the attack by 24 hours (in breach, as it happens, of the secret agreement between Britain, France and Israel) in order to bring the Americans on board, although they thought it unlikely to work, but it was not adopted. Macleod was telling others of his dismay that ministers had not been fully informed of the agreement with France and Israel. Either now or at some subsequent meeting Eden apologised to the Cabinet for his reticence “in time of war”, causing Macleod to snap “I <b>was</b> not aware <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> war, Prime Minister!” The Anglo-French ultimatum was on the afternoon of 30 October.|$|R

The advances in understanding the problems and needs of end user searching of IR systems seemed transferable to OPAC use, and some online catalogs, as they evolved, were beginning to incorporate the more sophisticated keyword and Boolean search methods common in the conventional IR systems. The transformation of the library catalog into a diverse, online information resource had begun. The promise was clear: OPACs could be better library catalogs than their predecessors, and OPACs could be both powerful and usable interactive retrieval systems. Today, <b>we</b> must recognize <b>that</b> much of this promise is being fulfilled. Existing second-generation OPACs with their MARC catalog record databases can be viewed from a functional perspective as special purpose online reference retrieval systems. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R
40|$|When {{the present}} war began in September 1939, {{the evils of}} {{inflation}} so typical {{of the first world}} war induced the warring nations to adopt the principle of price control. Germany had established an over-all price ceiling in October 1936, which indicates how long ago Germany had begun to prepare her economy to withstand the shock of war. An actual price inflation constituted no serious threat to Canada {{at the start of the}} war because we had idle capital and idle labour. The amount of economic “slack” arising from developments prior to the outbreak of war is surveyed in Chapter I. Briefly, it may be described as the result of the rising period of prosperity which culminated in 1929 and the depression which followed in the 1930 ’s. Although it appeared in 1937 <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> last climbing out of the depression, we had another setback in 1938. Thus Canada entered the war with an industrial output far below her capacity. [ [...] . ...|$|R
