5|$|Although the Japanese Army's {{attack on}} the Allied Lunga {{perimeter}} was decisively defeated in this battle, the Japanese were not yet ready <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> struggle for Guadalcanal.

5|$|Constantine neither {{enjoyed his}} legal studies, nor found the work easy, but was {{determined}} to prove he could succeed. His wife kept him motivated, restricted visitors to avoid distractions and forced him to study, making him continue when he was several times tempted <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> family moved to London in 1949; between 1950 and 1954, Constantine passed the required series of examinations, and in 1954 he was called to the bar by the Middle Temple.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, U.S. {{federal judge}} Tena Campbell {{rejected}} Gardner's appeal that his attorneys were inadequate {{because they were}} unable to prove that he did not mean to kill his victim. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit rejected motions for appeal by his defense on March 8, 2010. Gardner attempted <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> process at least three times, but his attorneys convinced him to continue appealing each time. State court Judge Robin Reese signed an execution warrant on April 23 ordering the state to carry out the death sentence.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer finally agrees <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> inhalers, {{but only}} to Kate.

Kate elbows Sawyer, and an enraged Sayid attacks him, stabbing him in the arm and hitting an artery. Jack arrives to stop the bleeding and save Sawyer's life.|$|E

5|$|The Germans {{were delighted}} with this outcome, and were happy <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{sacrifice}} {{of a small}} provincial rail centre to Poland {{in exchange for the}} ensuing propaganda benefits. It spread the blame of the partition of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, made Poland a participant in the process and confused political expectations. Poland was accused of being an accomplice of Nazi Germany – a charge that Warsaw was hard-put to deny.|$|E
5|$|The Liberal Party's {{decision}} not to enter a coalition with the Conservatives, and Baldwin's unwillingness to govern without a majority, led to Ramsay MacDonald's first minority Labour government which took office in January 1924. According to Lansbury's biographer, Bondfield turned down the offer of a cabinet post; instead, she became parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Labour, Tom Shaw. This appointment meant that she had <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> TUC Council chair; her decision to do so, immediately after becoming {{the first woman to}} achieve this honour, generated some criticism from other trade unionists.|$|E

It was altogether against business etiquette for the senior partners to do such errands themselves; moreover, it was thought that it would be easier for a clerk <b>to</b> explain, without <b>giving</b> undue offence, that he could not take the responsibility of a cheque or draft, without having cashed it previously <b>to</b> <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> jewels.|$|R

5|$|At this point, both armies {{began to}} draw apart; {{although}} sporadic fighting continued as night fell, by midnight both forces had disengaged completely. Both army councils met; Essex's plan to force {{his way past}} the Royalists seemed feasible, and many Parliamentarians, loathe <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> ground they had taken, fully expected the battle to continue. The Royalists, on the other hand, were plagued by poor morale, heavy losses {{and a lack of}} supplies, having used 80 of their 90 barrels of gunpowder. Although Rupert argued for the battle to continue, he was out-voted, and the next morning Essex was allowed to bypass the Royalist force without issue and continue his retreat towards London.|$|E
5|$|By early 1645 the war {{had turned}} decisively against the King, and in February, Parliamentary forces seized the county town of Shrewsbury. This exposed {{the rest of the}} region to attack, and in June a force of 800 Parliamentary {{soldiers}} pushed south towards Ludlow, attacking Stokesay en route. The Royalist garrison, led by Captain Daurett, was heavily outnumbered {{and it would have been}} impossible for them to effectively defend the new gatehouse, which was essentially ornamental. Nonetheless, both sides complied with the protocols of warfare at the time, resulting in a bloodless victory for the Parliamentary force: the besiegers demanded that the garrison surrender, the garrison refused, the attackers demanded a surrender for a second time, and this time the garrison were able <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> castle with dignity.|$|E
5|$|By seven-thirty, {{the town}} was firmly {{in the hands of}} Major-General Hunter's force. Almost the {{entirety}} of the Mahdist garrison, excepting the cavalry, had been slain in desperate combats throughout the settlement. However, a few isolated pockets of Mahdist resistance remained in fortified houses, violently refusing <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> fight. Six men sent to capture a Mahdist sniper's position in a small house near the river were each killed, forcing Hunter to invoke his artillery. The building was shelled to ruins, but the sniper survived, evidenced by the shooting of another soldier sent to locate his body. Finally, a second barrage of artillery blasted what remained of the structure and the rubble fell silent, though the sniper's body was never found. The local inhabitants had armed themselves with clubs and spears to defend themselves during the battle, but played little role in its outcome.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Heraclius died, much of Egypt had been lost, and by 637638 {{the whole of}} Syria was {{in the hands of}} the armies of Islam. With 3,5004,000 troops under his command, 'Amr ibn al-A'as first crossed into Egypt from Palestine at the end of 639 or the {{beginning}} of 640. He was progressively joined by further reinforcements, notably 12,000 soldiers by Al-Zubayr. 'Amr first besieged and conquered Babylon, and then attacked Alexandria. The Byzantines, divided and shocked by the sudden loss of so much territory, agreed <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> city by September 642. The fall of Alexandria extinguished Byzantine rule in Egypt, and allowed the Muslims to continue their military expansion into North Africa; between 643644 'Amr completed the conquest of Cyrenaica. Uthman succeeded Caliph Umar after his death.|$|E
5|$|Eddy left Boston in September {{and sailed}} to Machias, where he {{recruited}} about 20 men. On October 13, this party sailed from Machias for Passamaquoddy Bay. Coincidentally, John Allan, {{who was working}} on a longer-term plan for military action, sailed from Campobello Island for Machias the same day. The two parties met at sea, where Allan attempted to dissuade Eddy from his plan, informing him that the Mi'kmaq (the largest tribe in Nova Scotia) would not help him. Allan extracted a promise from Eddy to wait at Campobello while he went to Machias to meet with the council there. When the Machias council learned of how little native support there was, they sent a letter to Eddy urging him <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> effort. Eddy persisted, and left Campobello, having added nine Passamaquoddy recruits to his band.|$|E
5|$|Having {{secured the}} eastern front, the King {{was able to}} {{concentrate}} on the recovery of Baltic areas lost by his father to Sweden. Władysław IV wanted {{to take advantage of the}} Swedish defeat at Nördlingen and fight for both the territories and his Swedish dynastic claims. The Poles were suspicious of his designs and war preparations and the King was able to proceed with negotiations only, where his unwillingness <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> dynastic claim weakened the Commonwealth's position. According to the Treaty of Stuhmsdorf of 1635 the Swedes evacuated Royal Prussia's cities and ports, which meant a return of the Crown's lower Vistula possessions, and stopped collecting custom duties there. Sweden retained most of Livonia, while the Rzeczpospolita kept Courland, which having assumed the servicing of Lithuania's Baltic trade entered a period of prosperity.|$|E

5|$|Houlding died in 1902, and in 1905 the {{ownership}} of the club was restructured. Of the existing 3,000 shares, 2,000 were held by the Houlding family. The club owed a debt of £10,000 to Houlding, and a further £5,000 bank overdraft was guaranteed by his family. The family offered <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> 2,000 shares and wipe out the debt, if the club relieved them of the bank loan guarantee. The board agreed, and a new share issue was released in 1906 with 15,000 shares available for £1 each. Following the share issue, McKenna became chairman of the club.|$|E
5|$|In October 1965, Leeds skipper Collins {{was injured}} in an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup game against Torino and Revie gave the {{captaincy}} to Bremner after initially handing the armband to Charlton {{for the remainder of}} the season; Charlton was keen <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> captaincy as it prevented his superstitious ritual of coming out of the tunnel last on match days. Revie and Bremner had a strong bond of trust, which was why the manager gave him the captaincy at such a young age. Leeds finished second in the league in the 1965–66 campaign to Liverpool, who had finished six points clear at the top.|$|E
5|$|In Oosterbeek, the {{situation}} was becoming more desperate. Hackett {{was wounded in the}} morning and had <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> eastern command. The RAF attempted some close support around the perimeter which just held, but shelling and sniping increased casualties by the hour. The aid stations were home to some 2,000 men, both British and German as well as Dutch civilian casualties. Because many of them were actually in the front line in homes taken over earlier in the battle, the odd situation was created where casualties were evacuated forward rather than rearwards. Without evacuation, the wounded were often injured again and some posts changed hands between the British and Germans several times as the perimeter was fought over.|$|E
