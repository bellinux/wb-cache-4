50|$|V. cholerae has two {{circular}} chromosomes, together <b>totalling</b> 4 <b>million</b> base <b>pairs</b> of DNA {{sequence and}} 3,885 predicted genes. The genes for cholera toxin are carried by CTXphi (CTXφ), a temperate bacteriophage {{inserted into the}} V. cholerae genome. CTXφ can transmit cholera toxin genes from one V. cholerae strain to another, one form of horizontal gene transfer. The genes for toxin coregulated pilus are coded by the Vibrio pathogenicity island (VPI).The entire genome of the virulent strain V. cholerae El Tor N16961 has been sequenced, and contains two circular chromosomes. Chromosome 1 has 2,961,149 base pairs with 2,770 open reading frames (ORF’s) and chromosome 2 has 1,072,315 base pairs, 1,115 ORF’s. The larger first chromosome contains the crucial genes for toxicity, regulation of toxicity, and important cellular functions, such as transcription and translation.|$|R
40|$|The late blight {{pathogen}} Phytophthora infestans can attack both potato {{foliage and}} tubers. When inoculated with P. infestans, foliage of nontransformed 'Russet Burbank' (WT) develops late blight disease while that of transgenic 'Russet Burbank' line SP 2211 (+RB) does not. We compared the foliar transcriptome responses {{of these two}} lines to P. infestans inoculation using an RNA-seq approach. A <b>total</b> of 515 <b>million</b> <b>paired</b> end RNA-seq reads were generated, representing the transcription of 29, 970 genes. We also compared the differences and similarities of defense mechanisms against P. infestans in potato foliage and tubers. Differentially expressed genes, gene groups and ontology bins were identified to show similarities and differences in foliage and tuber defense mechanisms. Our results suggest that R gene dosage and shared biochemical pathways (such as ethylene and stress bins) contribute to RB-mediated incompatible potato-P. infestans interactions in both the foliage and tubers. Certain ontology bins such as cell wall and lipid metabolisms are potentially organ-specific...|$|R
5000|$|In 1856 {{a wealthy}} US entrepreneur, Henry Lee Norris, {{established}} the North British Rubber Company in the {{buildings of the}} former Castle Silk Mill alongside the Union Canal. The company's Castle Mill premises eventually covered 20 acres {{of land in the}} area and employed thousands of workers over five generations in manufacturing a variety of products from galoshes and rubber Wellington boots to solid rubber wheels for Thomson steam traction engines (after 1870), pneumatic tyres (after 1890) and hot-water bottles. The company's design for trench boots, which was officially chosen by the War Office during the Great War, led to a lucrative government contract which saw the firm supplying up to 2750 pairs a day, reaching a <b>total</b> of 1.2 <b>million</b> <b>pairs</b> {{by the end of the}} war. Similar contracts resulted in the production of 1/4 of a <b>million</b> <b>pairs</b> of gymshoes, 47,000 pairs of heavy snow boots for the French Army, 16,000 tyres and 2.5 million feet of hosepipe. The Second World War brought another boom with the production of millions of civilian gas masks and barrage-balloon fabric. In 1958, the company produced Britain's first traffic cones for the M6 motorway. The United States Rubber Company gradually took control of the company. The United States Rubber Company was renamed Uniroyal in 1961 and North British took on this name when eventually taken-over in 1966. In that year, Uniroyal relocated the tyre manufacture to Newbridge, then outside Edinburgh. In 1957 Castle Mills began the production of Royalite thermoplastic sheeting. In 1967 Royalite production was moved to a new factory adjacent to the tyre plant at Newbridge. The manufacture of PowerGrip drive belts was relocated to the former Arrol-Johnston factory at Heathhall, Dumfries around 1970. All that remained at Castle Mills was the hose factory which continued until its closure in late 1973.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{conducted}} a regional tracking program on seabirds {{in order to}} identify major forging hotspots and potential Marine Protected Areas in the tropical western Indian Ocean. Thirty-one species of seabirds breed in the region, <b>totaling</b> 7. 4 <b>million</b> <b>pairs.</b> The main breeding grounds are in the Seychelles, in the Mozambique Channel and in the Mascarene. Seven pelagic species have been tracked so far from eight different islands of the region. Using count per sector analysis we identified five major oceanic foraging hotspots, among which three include the breeding colonies and two are oceanic areas not connected to a breeding island. We found important overlaps between most of these seabird foraging hotspots and potential threats (industrial fishery targeting surface dwelling tunas and marine pollution due to maritime routes) suggesting that in these regions seabirds may be at risk when foraging. Although this analysis is based on a limited number of tracking studies, the knowledge on seabird distribution at sea has increased tremendously in the last 6 years in the tropical western Indian Ocean, and this trend will continue, as research is ongoing. The data, we present {{here for the first time}} in a single synthesis show clear spatial patterns that identify high priority locations for designation as Marine Protected Areas in the tropical western Indian Ocean...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. February 2013. Major: Plant pathology. Advisor: Dr. James M. Bradeen. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 91 pages, appendices I. Wild potato Solanum bulbocastanum {{is a rich}} source of genetic resistance against a variety of pathogens. This project developed molecular tools and expanded biological knowledge useful for the improvement of cultivated potato (S. tuberosum) using genetic resistance from S. bulbocastanum. First, the genome structure of S. bulbocastanum relative to those of its relatives, cultivated potato and tomato (S. lycopersicon) was determined. Second, to facilitate efforts to improve cultivated potato through the introgression and deployment disease resistance derived from S. bulbocastanum, the phenotypic function and molecular mechanisms of one S. bulbocastanum disease resistance gene were explored in cultivated potato foliage and tubers. For determination of genome structure for S. bulbocastanum, Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) was employed to generate genome wide linkage maps for the species. Employing a pseudo-testcross mapping strategy, 631 DArT markers were integrated into a composite map comprising 12 linkage groups. Our results represent an over ten-fold increase of total marker density compared to previously available genetic maps for the species. Sequencing and alignment of corresponding DArT clones to reference physical maps from tomato and cultivated potato allowed a direct comparison of marker orders between species. Overall, the S. bulbocastanum genetic maps show higher collinearity with reference potato maps than tomato maps, with seven genome regions supporting a closer phylogenetic relationship between potato and S. bulbocastanum than between tomato and S. bulbocastanum. One dominant US cultivar ‘Russet Burbank’(WT; late blight susceptible in foliage and tuber) and its RB (a late blight resistance gene derived from S. bulbocastanum) transgenic line SP 2211 (+RB; late blight resistant in foliage and tuber) were compared in both tubers and foliage in their responses to late blight pathogen attack using an RNA-seq approach. In the tubers, a <b>total</b> of 483 <b>million</b> <b>paired</b> end Illumina RNA-seq reads were generated, representing the transcription of 29, 319 potato genes. Differentially expressed genes, gene groups and ontology bins that exhibited differences between the WT and +RB lines were identified. P. infestans transcripts, including those of known effectors, were also identified. Faster and stronger activation of defense related genes, gene groups and ontology bins correlated with successful tuber resistance against P. infestans. Our results suggest that the hypersensitive response is likely a general form of resistance against the hemibiotrophic P. infestans—even in potato tubers, organs that develop below ground. In the foliage, a <b>total</b> of 515 <b>million</b> <b>paired</b> end RNA-seq reads were generated, representing the transcription of 29, 970 genes. We compared the differences and similarities of responses to P. infestans in potato foliage and tubers.

40|$|International audienceWe {{present the}} first {{detailed}} information on breeding marine birds from the southern Lagoon of New Caledonia, southwest Pacific. The area under consideration, 5, 000 km 2, hosts 74 islets varying in size from ca. 0. 05 to 30 ha. We found 13 breeding seabird species, of the 23 known to breed in the New Caledonian region. The most significant seabird numbers included large colonies of Black Noddy (Anous minutus, 50, 000 - 100, 000 pairs) and espe-cially Wedge-tailed Shearwaters (Puffinus pacificus); the latter species <b>totaling</b> half a <b>million</b> <b>pairs</b> and probably the largest colony in the world. About 5, 000 pairs of Roseate Tern (Sterna dougalli) have been found. Several species of conservation concern are also breeding in appreciable numbers, e. g., Fairy Tern (Sterna nereis) and Tahiti Petrel (Pseudobulweria rostrata); both New Caledonian endemic subspecies. However, some species are now very rare (e. g., Red-footed Booby Sula sula), and others have appreciably declined {{over the last eight}} years (Fairy Tern, Black-naped Tern Sterna sumatrana and Crested Tern S. bergii). The recent increase in the frequency of visits to islets by people from Nouméa (ca. 100, 000 inhabitants), resulting from the increase in the number of leisure boats, may be the prin-cipal factor responsible for the current trends and threats. Human disturbance seems to be a major threat that may lead to desertion of seabirds on islets, or reduced breeding succes...|$|R
