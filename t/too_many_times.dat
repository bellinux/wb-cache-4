Fictional lettering, resembling Chinese and Hangul characters, fill the billboards and signs. Western gargoyles and Singapore's Merlion statues decorate the streets, and the buildings are modeled on Shinjuku structures of 2003 while blending influences from the Shōwa period. This Shinjuku is populated by humans and Japanese folklore spirits, yōkai. The humans have become indifferent to the yōkais presence, and fail to see them as they go about their lives.|$|E
5|$|Legacy Parkway {{is part of}} {{the larger}} Legacy Highway project first {{proposed}} by then-governor Mike Leavitt, which ultimately will run north from Nephi toward Brigham City. The concept of a western Davis County highway has existed since the 1960s, with some proposals routing the highway over Antelope Island or across Farmington Bay. Legacy Parkway was to extend to {{the west side of the}} Salt Lake City International Airport and connect to I-80 at 5600West; however, that plan was abandoned in October 1997. A survey taken by Valley Research for The Salt Lake Tribune in December 1997 showed 64percent of Davis County residents were in support of building the parkway, with just 19percent opposing the construction. State officials had hoped to have the parkway open in time for the 2002 Winter Olympics being held in Salt Lake City; however, construction was delayed <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> for that to occur.|$|E

5|$|The player uses a {{joystick}} and button to input commands, though home versions use a game controller with a directional pad. As the game progresses, visual cues—highlighted {{portions of the}} background or foreground—will appear on the screen to help survive the dangers that occur throughout the stage; more difficult settings omit the visual cues. Depending on {{the location of the}} cue, the player will input one of four directions (up, down, left and right) or an attack (shoot the target with a laser gun). Inputting the correct command will either avoid or neutralize the threats and progress the game, while incorrect choices result in the character's death. Reika dying <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> results in a game over. Specific moments in the game involve Reika stopping time. During these moments, players are presented with a list of three options and have seven seconds to choose the one which will save the character.|$|E
5|$|When first played, {{the game}} offers one {{difficulty}} level that is adjusted automatically if {{the game is}} too difficult for the player. For example, if the player's character dies <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>times,</b> the enemies' artificial intelligence is made less effective, while more health {{in the form of}} painkillers is made available. After completing the game once, other difficulty levels are unlocked. Two special game modes are also activated: New York Minute and Dead Man Walking. In New York Minute, the player is given a score based on the time taken to complete each level. The Dead Man Walking mode places Max in one of five scenarios, in which he must survive {{for as long as possible}} while fighting off endlessly respawning enemies.|$|E
5|$|Players {{control the}} player {{character}} Kid Klown as {{he attempts to}} rescue Princess Honey from the villain Black Jack. The game's graphics are presented in an isometric view as Kid Klown automatically moves down a path to thwart Black Jack's plans of blowing up one of his spade bombs in each level. Various obstacles cause Kid Klown to slow down if they collide with him; if Kid Klown {{does not make it}} to the bomb in time or if he is hit <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>times,</b> the level is lost. The game consists of 5 stages. In each stage, Kid Klown must find all 4 card suit orbs and stop the bomb to complete the level. At the end of each stage Kid Klown gets a key which in turn at the ending could be of use to unlock Honey's cage. If the player gets all 4 orbs in the very first turn, Kid Klown also gets a Honey heart. After the fifth stage Kid Klown must find the correct lock out of the 10 locks to unlock Honey's cage.|$|E

Although he has no prior football experience, he has natural talent and becomes the team's first star quarterback. The second break comes to the Lions when Buddy Garrity reveals to Eric that the address on file for the Panthers new prodigy running back, Luke Cafferty, is nothing more than a mailbox in front of an empty lot, and Luke is really zoned for East Dillon. Tami is faced with a struggle as the principal of West Dillon. A new character on the show, Becky, is introduced when Tim Riggins rents a trailer on her mother's property. Although she is in love with Tim, she and Luke are both shopping at a convenience store and she allows Luke to drive her home. The two have sex and Becky becomes pregnant. Even though she is a student at East Dillon, she seeks out Tami's help with the situation. Tami discusses all of the options with her and Becky decides to get an abortion. Her mother goes with her to the procedure. Parents find out about this and led by Luke's mother, seek Mrs. Taylor's dismissal as principal.

30|$|Based on the {{provided}} sampling schedule, {{the estimated}} TIACs were set as reference. However, this sampling schedule may be inherently suboptimal. If fewer measurement points are considered, {{the influence of}} each single remaining data point will become more prominent. Clearly, the number of fitting parameters limits the number of required measurements to achieve a sufficiently precise estimation of TIACs and hence absorbed doses. When looking at the estimated standard deviations of the fitting parameters (for both approaches, standard, and iterative), these increase with decreasing number of measurements (results not shown). This in turn {{was reflected in the}} estimation of the TIACs. Therefore, conducting a precise estimation of TIACs is limited if <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>time</b> points (measurements) are omitted. To overcome this problem, simulations could be performed to determine when (in contrast to how often) the biodistribution should be measured. This may reduce the standard deviations of the fitting parameters and may yield a globally optimal sampling schedule.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis work investigates solving coupled magneto-thermal {{problems}} {{through a}} proper generalized decomposition (PGD) based non-incremental approach. The magneto-dynamic and thermos-dynamic problems are strongly coupled as the electric material property changes with the temperature while the temperature field evolves {{due to the}} Joule heat generated by induced currents. A challenge to solve the coupled {{problem is that the}} electric time constant can be several orders of magnitude smaller than the thermal one. Solution through a classical time integration approach requires <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>time</b> steps especially when a long duration needs to be simulated; hence making the problem size too large to be handled. The proposed solver overcome this difficulty through decomposing unknown dynamic fields into space and time modes and solving the linearized systems in space and time iteratively, using the finite element method. The material nonlinearity can be incorporated in a straightforward way. Advantages of the proposed solver are demonstrated in solving an academic problem...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Discrete-fracture {{and rock}} matrix (DFM) {{modelling}} necessitates a physically realistic discretisation {{of the large}} aspect ratio fractures and the dissected material domains. Using unstructured spatially adaptively refined finite-element meshes, {{we find that the}} fast-est flow often occurs in the smallest elements. Flow velocity and element size vary over many orders of magnitude, disqualifying global Courant number (CFL) -dependent transport schemes because <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>time</b> steps would be necessary to investigate displacements of interest. Here, we present a higher-order accurate implicit pressure–(semi) -implicit trans-port scheme for the advection–diffusion equation that overcomes this CFL limitation for DFM models. Using operator splitting, we solve the pressure and the transport equations on finite-element, node-centred finite-volume meshes, respectively, using algebraic multigrid methods. We apply this approach to field data-based DFM models where the fracture flow velocity and mesh refinement is 2 – 4 orders of magnitude greater than that of the matrix. For a global CFL of ≤ 10, 000, this implies sub-CFL, second-order accurate behaviour in the matrix, and super-CFL, at least first-order accurate, transports in fast-flowing fractures. Their greater refinement, however, largely offsets this numerical dispersion, promoting...|$|R
