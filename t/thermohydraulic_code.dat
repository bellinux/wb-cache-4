Results on the heat transfer crisis, obtained using the <b>thermohydraulic</b> <b>code</b> RELAP- 5 /MOD 3 were compared to the experiment results. The comparison revealed, that the deviation of the critical heat flux value, obtained experimentally from the one, obtained using the code reaches 25 % in case of p = 14. 0 MPa, and the value, calculated by the code is higher. The deviation increases with the decrease of pressure: for p = 6. 0 MPa critical heat flux value, obtained using RELAP- 5 /MOD 3 exceeds the experimental value for 40 ? 50 %. Therefore, the ACEL table method, which is used as basis for the critical heat flux calculation in RELAP- 5 /MOD 3 {{turns out to be}} unacceptable for the critical heat flux calculation for hexagonal assemblies {{in a wide range of}} thermohydraulic parameters. ????????? ??????????? ?????? ?? ??????? ???????????, ??????? ???? ???????? ? ??????? ?????????? ???????????????????? ????

40|$|In {{the frame}} of the {{research}} program 1500 844 / 8 - Training of Scientists of the University of Dresden on the KESS-III Code System and Modification of Models Simulating the Thermal Behavior of WWER-Fuel Rods under Severe Accident Conditions - the core heatup phase of the WWER- 1000 reactor under severe accident conditions were analysed using the core melt code KESS-III. To compare model results a low pressure case (large break of the cold leg) using the plant of the German Risk Study Phase A / 1 / was examined. For the model analyses of severe accidents in the WWER- 1000 reactor the available data were used and the code was modified concerning the hydraulic diameter (hexagonal grid). The initial time of the core uncovery for the analysis of the WWER- 1000 was estimated, because at present no model calculations using a complex <b>thermohydraulic</b> <b>code</b> to determine this initial condition were undertaken. The comparison of model results between the low and high pressure case in the WWER- 1000 reactor showed, that besides the later onset of core uncovery the heatup rate of the fuel rods in the high pressure case is lower. Furthermore from the analysis one obtained a delayed core uncovery of the WWER- 1000 in comparison of the reference plant due to the larger coolant inventory. At least the KESS-III code was applied to bundle experiments, which were performed out-of-pile in the CORA test facility at the Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe and in-pile in the PHEBUS reactor at CEA in Cadarache.

40|$|Based on the {{equations}} of energy, mass and momentum conservation for the three-dimensional unsteady {{flow of the}} two-phase mixture, simulations were made of reactor plant disturbed cooling condition modes caused by the VVER secondary circuit using computer <b>thermohydraulic</b> <b>codes.</b> The use of computer codes to investigate these modes {{makes it possible to}} analyze transient and some emergency processes, without involving the industrial testing method; this helps create a basis for solving the problems of reliability, operational safety, and efficiency of nuclear power plants. A modern nuclear reactor is a complex system which cannot be investigated or calculated by using only simple theoretical models. Thermohydraulic calculations are an essential part of most of the design and technological developments in the nuclear power industry. Since the NPP conditions exclude the traditional technical way to check and specify the results and conclusions of an aprioristic analysis based on industrial testing, in some instances, it is possible to examine and predict the parameters of thermohydraulic processes in the reactor circulation circuit involving computer simulations. The primary objective of this work is to calculate and investigate reactor disturbed plant cooling condition modes caused by the VVER secondary circuit in order to determine whether the calculated parameters conform to the acceptance criteria established in the regulatory documents. Based on the RELAP- 5, TRAC, and TRACE software codes, reactor plant cooling condition malfunction modes caused by the VVER- 1000 secondary circuit were simulated and investigated. Experimental data on the mode with the turbine-generator stop valve closing are presented. The obtained dependences made it possible to determine the maximum values of pressure and temperature in the circulation circuit as well as estimate the Minimum Critical Heat Flux Ratio (MCHFR). It has been found that, if any of the initial events occurs, safety systems are activated according to the set points; transient processes are stabilized in time; and the Critical Heat Flux (CHF) limit is provided. Therefore, in the event of emergency associated with the considered modes, the reactor plant safety will be ensured...|$|R

40|$|As {{part of the}} IAEA’s overall {{effort to}} foster {{international}} collaborations that strive to improve the economics and safety of future water cooled nuclear power plants, an IAEA Coordinated Research Project (CRP) was started in early 2004. This CRP, entitled Natural Circulation Phenomena, Modelling and Reliability of Passive Safety Systems that Utilize Natural Circulation, focuses {{on the use of}} passive safety systems to help meet the safety and economic goals {{of a new generation of}} nuclear power plants. This CRP has been organized within the framework of the IAEA Department of Nuclear Energy’s Technical Working Groups for Advanced Technologies for Light Water Reactors and Heavy Water Reactors (the TWG-LWR and the TWG-HWR) and has provided an international cooperation on research work underway at the national level in several IAEA Member States. The use of passive safety systems was addressed in 1991 at the IAEA Conference on “The Safety of Nuclear Power: Strategy for the Future” [1 - 1]. Subsequently, experts in research institutes and nuclear plant design organizations from several IAEA Member States collaboratively presented their common views in a paper entitled “Balancing passive and active systems for evolutionary water cooled reactors” in Ref. [1 - 2]. The experts noted that a designer’s first consideration is to satisfy the required safety function with sufficient reliability, and the designer must also consider other aspects such as the impact on plant operation, design simplicity and costs. The use of passive safety systems such as accumulators, condensation and evaporative heat exchangers, and gravity driven safety injection systems eliminates the costs associated with the installation, maintenance and operation of active safety systems that require multiple pumps with independent and redundant electric power supplies. As a result, passive safety systems are being considered for numerous reactor concepts (including in Generation III and III+ concepts) and are expected to find applications in the Generation-IV reactor concepts, as identified by the Generation IV International Forum (GIF). Another motivation for the use of passive safety systems is the potential for enhanced safety through increased safety system reliability. The CRP benefits from earlier IAEA activities that include developing databases on physical processes of significant importance to water cooled reactor operations and safety [1 - 3, 1 - 4], technical information exchange meetings on recent technology advances [1 - 5 – 1 - 11], and status reports on advanced water cooled reactors [1 - 12, 1 - 13]. In the area of thermohydraulic phenomena in advanced water cooled reactors, recent IAEA activities have assimilated data internationally on heat transfer coefficients and pressure drop [1 - 3]; and have shared information on natural circulation data and analytical methods [1 - 5], and on experimental tests and qualification of analytical methods [1 - 6]. This CRP also benefits from a recent report issued by IAEA [1 - 14] on the status of innovative small and medium sized reactor designs. In order to establish the progress of work in this CRP, an Integrated Research Plan with description of the tasks addressing the objectives of the CRP was defined. These tasks are:  Establish the state of the art on natural circulation  Identify and describe reference systems  Identify and characterize phenomena that influence natural circulation  Examine application of data and codes to design and safety  Examine the reliability of passive systems that utilize natural circulation The results of the CRP work have been planned to be published in three consecutive IAEA-TECDOC reports. The activity under the first task is aimed at summarizing the current understanding of natural circulation system phenomena and the methods used experimentally to investigate and model such phenomena. In November 2005, the IAEA issued a technical document as first publication [1 - 15] in three TECDOC report series of this CRP on natural circulation, developed by the collaborative effort of the CRP participants and with major contributions from some selected experts in the CRP, aimed at documenting the present knowledge in six specific areas; advantages and challenges of natural circulation systems in advanced designs, local transport phenomena and models, integral system phenomena and models, natural circulation experiments, advanced computation methods, and reliability assessment methodology. The activity for the third task is aimed at identifying and categorizing the natural circulation phenomena of importance to advanced reactors and passive safety system operations and reliability. This task is the major link between the second and the fourth tasks. The activities related to the second task and the fourth task including the fifth task are agreed to be published in two different TECDOCs by the CRP participants. Since the third task is the backbone for both tasks, inclusion of this task in both TECDOCs in an appropriate form is a logical consequence. The aim of the second publication in this series of TECDOCs [1 - 16] was to describe passive safety systems in a wide range of advanced water cooled nuclear power plant designs with the goal of gaining insights into the system design, operation, and reliability without endorsement of the performance. This second publication has a unique feature which includes plant design descriptions with a strong emphasis on passive safety systems of the specific designs. These descriptions of the passive safety systems together with the phenomena identification (including the definitions of the phenomenon to describe in some detail the titles of the phenomenon considered) are also given in the Annexes and Appendix of the report [1 - 16], respectively. Based on the passive systems and phenomena, which are considered, a cross-reference matrix has been established and also presented in this second report. As basis for the phenomenon identification, earlier works performed within the OECD/NEA framework during 1983 – 1997 were considered. These are:  Code validation matrix of <b>thermohydraulic</b> <b>codes</b> for LWR loss of coolant accident (LOCA) and transients [1 - 17]  State of the art report (SOAR) on thermohydraulic of emergency core cooling in light water reactors [1 - 18]  Separate Effects Test (SET) Validation Matrix for Light Water Reactors [1 - 19]  Integral Facility Tests Validation Matrix for Light Water Reactors [1 - 20]  Status report on relevant thermohydraulic aspects of advanced reactor designs [1 - 21] Since the Generation III and III+ reactor designs contain technological features that are common to the current generation reactors, the phenomena identified during the work performed for first item to fourth item can be used as base knowledge. The fifth item provides the important and relevant thermohydraulic phenomena for advanced reactor designs in addition to the relevant thermohydraulic phenomena identified for the current generation of light water reactors (LWR). The list of relevant phenomena established in Ref. 1 - 21 has been taken as basis for the CRP work and has been modified according to the reactor types and passive safety systems considered in TECDOC- 1624 [1 - 16]. It is to be noted that in identifying the relevant thermohydraulic phenomena in the list which is provided in this report, expert judgement is the main contributor. The two TECDOCs (the present TECDOC and TECDOC- 1624) have been produced as consequent volumes independent of each other in their use and contents. The present TECDOC is the third publication in this series of TECDOC reports and its contents are described below. The identification and definition of the phenomena for advanced water cooled reactors with emphasis to passive safety systems is also presented in the second chapter of this TECDOC. Phenomena have been classified into two categories. These are phenomena occurring during interaction between primary system and containment; and phenomena caused by the presence of new components and systems or special reactor configurations. These descriptions are supplement to the definitions of phenomena which are developed for the current operational water cooled nuclear power plants [1 - 19, 1 - 20]. Twelve phenomena have been identified as key outcome of the process in Chapter 2 and the characterization of these additional phenomena for advanced water cooled reactors are provided in Chapter 3. The characterization of these additional phenomena includes exhaustive description of phenomena considering a comprehensive picture of the transient performance of the class of innovative reactors which are described in Ref. 1 - 16. Each of these descriptions includes outlines of models and an overview of the experimental data base that support the characterization of phenomena. The capabilities of thermohydraulics transient system codes or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes in predicting the same phenomena are evaluated and the results from the application of the codes to the analysis of experimental data are provided, as applicable to the case. After providing an overview on the phenomena and their characterization, Chapter 4 includes example cases for integral test facilities which simulate the prototypical plant design, some analysis of the experimental data obtained, use of these experimental data to help assess the predictive capabilities of the computer codes to model the phenomena that are occurring in the experimental test facilities, and application to the nuclear power plant analysis. In this chapter, a wide variety of prototypical plant designs, integral test facilities and thermohydraulics transient system codes, which are used in the analysis of plants and integral test facilities, are included. The collected and summarized information makes this chapter an excellent resource for providing understanding on the general capabilities of the integral test facilities and computer codes used for the examination of the natural circulation phenomena. As it has already been mentioned, the passive safety systems in their designs rely on natural forces to perform their accident prevention and mitigation functions once actuated and started. These driving forces are not generated by external power sources (e. g., pumped systems), as is the case in operating and some evolutionary reactor designs. Because the magnitude of the natural forces, which drive the operation of passive systems, is relatively small, counterforces (e. g. friction) can be of comparable magnitude and cannot be ignored as it is generally the case of systems including pumps. Moreover, there are considerable uncertainties associated with factors on which the magnitude of these forces and counter forces depends (e. g. values of heat transfer coefficients and pressure losses). In addition, the magnitude of such natural driving forces depends on specific plant conditions and configurations which could exist at the time a system is called upon to perform its safety function. All these uncertainties affect the thermohydraulic performance of the passive system. This particular aspect, inherent to the passive systems, has been dealt with in Chapter 5 and the methodology, which was developed within the framework of a project called Reliability Methods for Passive Safety Functions (RMPS) and performed under the auspices of the European Commission’s 5 th Framework Programme, has been presented in some detail in that chapter. To assess the impact of uncertainties on the predicted performance of the passive system, a large number of calculations with best estimate <b>thermohydraulic</b> <b>codes</b> are needed. If all the sequences where the passive system studied is involved are considered, the number of calculations can be prohibitive. For all these reasons, it is necessary to create a specific methodology to assess the reliability of passive systems. The methodology addresses the following problems:  Identification and quantification of the sources of uncertainties and determination of the important variables;  Propagation of the uncertainties through thermohydraulic models and assessment of thermohydraulic passive system unreliability;  Introduction of passive system unreliability in the accident sequence analysis. In Section 1 of Chapter 5 (Section 5. 1), each step of the methodology is described and commented and a diagram of the methodology is presented. Some improvements of this methodology, proposed after the end of the RMPS project (in early 2004) are highlighted in Section 5. 2. Alternative methodologies, which have been developed by other institutions in parallel, are presented in Section 5. 3. These methodologies are the ENEA methodology (developed by ENEA, Bologna, Italy) and Assessment of Passive System Reliability (ASPRA) (developed by BARC, India). Finally the application of the RMPS methodology, as an example, to a Passive Residual Heat Removal System (PRHRS) of a “CAREM-like” reactor has been performed within the present IAEA CRP and this application is described in Section 5. 4. The major aim of this work is to quantify the failure probability of the passive safety function associated with the system under analysis. The last chapter of this TECDOC (Chapter 6) is devoted to summarize the detailed conclusions and recommendations, which were already provided in the contents of the various chapters. These conclusions and recommendations are given in a concise form for use of further needs in research, development, and technology areas...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Computer and Electronical Engineering) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. Many {{hours are}} spent by systemand control {{engineers}} deriving reduced order dynamicmodels portraying the dominant systemdynamics of thermohydraulic systems. A need therefore exists {{to develop a}} method that will automate the model derivation process. The model format preferred for control system design and analysis during preliminary system design is the state space format. The {{aim of this study}} is therefore to develop an automated and generic state space model extraction method that can be applied to thermohydraulic systems. Well developed system identiﬁcation methods exist for obtaining state space models from input-output data, but these models are not transparent, meaning the parameters do not have any physical meaning. For example one cannot identify system parameters such as heat or mass transfer coefﬁcients. Another approach is needed to derive state space models automatically. Many commercial <b>thermohydraulic</b> simulation <b>codes</b> follow a network approach towards the representation of thermohydraulic systems. This approach {{is probably one of the}} most advanced approaches in terms of technical development. It would therefore be useful to develop a state space extraction algorithm that would be able to derive reduced order state space models from network representations of thermohydraulic systems. In this regard a network approach is followed in the development of the state space extraction algorithm. The advantage of using a network-based extraction method is that the extracted state space model is transparent and the algorithm can be embedded in existing simulation software that follow a network approach. In this study an existing state space extraction algorithm, used for electrical network analysis, is modiﬁed and applied in a new way to extract state space models of thermohydraulic systems. A thermohydraulic system is partitioned into its respective physical domains which, unlike electrical systems, have multiple variables. Network representations are derived for each domain. The state space algorithm is applied to these network representations to extract symbolic state spacemodels. The symbolic parametersmay then be substitutedwith numerical values. The state space extraction algorithm is applied to small scale thermohydraulic systems such as a U-tube and a heat exchanger, but also to a larger, more complex system such as the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor Power Conversion Unit (PBMR PCU). It is also shown that the algorithm can extract linear, nonlinear, time-varying and time-invariant state space models. The extracted state space models are validated by solving the state space models and comparing the solutions with Flownex results. Flownex is an advanced and extensively validated thermo-ﬂuid simulation code. The state space models compared well with Flownex results. The usefulness of the state space model extraction algorithm in model-based control system design is illustrated by extracting a linear time-invariant state space model of the PBMR PCU. This model is embedded in an optimal model-based control scheme called Model-Predictive Control (MPC). The controller is compared with standard optimised control schemes such as PID and Fuzzy PID control. The MPC controller shows superior performance compared to these control schemes. This study succeeded in developing an automated state space model extraction method that can be applied to thermohydraulic networks. Hours spent on writing down equations from ﬁrst principles to derive reduced order models for control purposes can now be replaced with a click of a button. The need for an automated state space model extraction method for thermohydraulic systems has therefore been resolvedDoctora...|$|R
