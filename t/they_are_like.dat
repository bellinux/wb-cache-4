5|$|Gamma: Hyde of the Dark Dimension follows Okabe, and {{is set in}} the gamma attractor field; he {{got there}} when {{attempting}} to undo the changes caused by his friend Luka Urushibara's D-mail in the Steins;Gate game. He discovers that in this world line, he is a Rounder partnered with Moeka Kiryu, and that they have just completed a mission to kill Europol agents who have discovered their identities. He runs to the laboratory to shift to the previous world line with a D-mail, but is stopped by Kurisu and Suzuha: Kurisu witnessed Okabe killing the agents, and Suzuha has in this world line traveled back in time to stop Okabe from becoming a dictator, leader of the Rounders, {{and a member of the}} Committee of 300. Kurisu calls the police, but Moeka helps Okabe escape. They visit Mayuri, who is hospitalized, and Okabe learns that they were childhood friends but got separated after the Year 2000 problem occurred, which led to a catastrophy and the death of Mayuri and Okabe's families. Learning that Mayuri has cancer and is not expected to live for much longer, Okabe leaves to clear his head. Moeka questions Luka about Okabe's D-mail, and concludes that the Year 2000 problem likely was caused by SERN. Moeka assures Okabe that they do not have to worry about Kurisu's report, as the Rounders are pressuring the police. She says that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>like</b> family in this world line, since Okabe saved her when she tried to commit suicide, and that she wants to help him even though he is different from the Okabe she knows. They receive their next mission – to take the time machine and its creators to SERN – but they decide to betray SERN, forcefully entering the laboratory prior to the scheduled mission; the other Rounders appear and shoot Okabe, but Moeka manages to send a D-mail that causes a world line shift, away from the gamma attractor field.|$|E

5|$|The {{ships which}} sail the {{southern}} sea {{and south of}} it are like houses. When their sails are spread <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>like</b> great clouds in the sky. Their rudders are several tens of feet long. A single ship carries several hundred men, and has in the stores a year's supply of grain. Pigs are fed and wine fermented on board. There is no account of dead or living, no {{going back to the}} mainland when once the people have set forth upon the caerulean sea. At daybreak, when the gong sounds aboard the ship, the animals can drink their fill, and crew and passengers alike forget all dangers. To those on board everything is hidden and lost in space, mountains, landmarks, and the countries of foreigners. The shipmaster may say 'To make such and such a country, with a favourable wind, in so many days, we should sight such and such a mountain, (then) the ship must steer in such and such a direction'. But suddenly the wind may fall, and may not be strong enough to allow of the sighting of the mountain on the given day; in such a case, bearings may have to be changed. And the ship (on the other hand) may be carried far beyond (the landmark) and may lose its bearings. A gale may spring up, the ship may be blown hither and thither, it may meet with shoals or be driven upon hidden rocks, then it may be broken to the very roofs (of its deckhouses). A great ship with heavy cargo has nothing to fear from the high seas, but rather in shallow water it will come to grief.|$|E

Although most are not pictographs in function, the early Western Zhou bronze inscriptions {{have been described as}} more pictographic in flavor than those of subsequent periods. During the Western Zhou, many graphs begin to show signs of simplification and linearization (the changing of rounded elements into squared ones, solid elements into short line segments, and thick, variable-width lines into thin ones of uniform width), with the result being a decrease in pictographic quality, as depicted in the chart below.|$|E

25|$|Frank Jackson {{formulated}} his well-known knowledge argument {{based upon}} similar considerations. In this thought experiment, known as Mary's room, he {{asks us to}} consider a neuroscientist, Mary, who was born, and has lived all of her life, in {{a black and white}} room with a black and white television and computer monitor where she collects all the scientific data she possibly can on the nature of colours. Jackson asserts that as soon as Mary leaves the room, she will come to have new knowledge which she did not possess before: the knowledge of the experience of colours (i.e., what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>like).</b> Although Mary knows {{everything there is to know}} about colours from an objective, third-person perspective, she has never known, according to Jackson, what it was like to see red, orange, or green. If Mary really learns something new, it must be knowledge of something non-physical, since she already knew everything about the physical aspects of colour.|$|E
25|$|The {{plan was}} {{formulated}} and preparations were completed by January 642. The success of plan depended upon how effectively Umar {{would be able}} to coordinate these attacks from Madinah, about 1500 kilometers from the battlefields in Persia and upon the skills and abilities of his field commanders. Umar appointed his best field commanders to conquer the Sassanid Empire and bring down his most formidable foe, Yazdegerd III. The campaign saw a different pattern in command structure. Instead of appointing a single field commander to campaign across the Persian lands, Umar appointed several commanders, each assigned a different mission. Once the mission would end the commander would become an ordinary soldier under the command of the new field commander for the latter's mission. The purpose of this strategy was to allow commanders to mix in with their soldiers and to remind them that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>like</b> everyone else; command is only given to those most competent, and once the battle is over, the commander returns to his previous position.|$|E

Reinforcing this view, Julie Gardner feels the love between Gwen and Jack to be self-evident and {{that it did not}} need to be spoken. Lynette Porter argues that Gwen's apotheosis of Jack causes him to flee Earth, as hero is a role he cannot play because he feels responsible for the deaths of those he loved. A press release ahead of the 2011 series stated that though Gwen retreats to a rural idyll with her family, she still retains feelings for Jack and misses the exciting life she once led alongside him. Ahead of the fourth series Myles explains that Gwen and Jack's relationship is a [...] "love-hate-love relationship", which she believes to be reminiscent of, concurrently, a sibling relationship, a husband and wife relationship and [...] "the best friendship known to mankind". Myles feels that Gwen is not complete without Jack and that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>like</b> [...] "two missing parts of a jigsaw" [...] and because the relationship works on so many different levels it cannot be labelled.

[...] The writer praised Browning's take on [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)", writing that it [...] "adds a lush darkness and vibrant vulnerability to the song reminiscent of Portishead's Beth Gibbons but with a flair all her own." [...] Florino awarded the album four and a half stars out of five, and concluded his review, writing, [...] "This is the kind of soundtrack that needs to be listened to from front to back, and if it's any indication, the film is destined {{to be one of the}} most mind-blowing and magnificent screen event this year, perhaps even the decade." [...] Allmusic's Heather Phares reviewed the album positively, praising Browning for [...] "deliver the soundtrack’s most affecting performances". Phares concluded her review with [...] "Sucker Punch is elaborate and sometimes overwrought, but it’s absolutely true to the film’s aesthetic." [...] Billboard reviewer Phil Gallo described the soundtrack as [...] "a rush of male-targeted female power" [...] which de Vries and Bates scored with [...] "dark, eerie and violent soundscapes". Gallo found Yoav's contribution to [...] "Where Is My Mind" [...] to be [...] "the soundtrack's most tender moment". Writing for Empire, Danny Graydon highlighted Browning's songs as [...] "seductive takes", and praised both Gugino and Isaac for [...] "an exuberant version of Roxy Music’s 'Love Is The Drug'" [...] and considering Björk's collaboration [...] "magnificently reversions 'Army Of Me' with Skunk Anansie". Jon M.
