Based on {{the analysis of the}} sealing mechanism of pipe thread, the essence of the pipe thread loosening is caused by fretting damage and fatigue. The following three methods are used to reduce the damage: the processing requirements of internal and external screw <b>thread</b> <b>tooth</b> type and size will be improved；the deformations which are made by a screwing torque to the external thread of the material itself will fill the gap in each part after internal and external screw thread are screwed together;plasticity sealing filler are put between internal and external screw thread...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the {{mechanistic}} cutting {{forces for}} thread milling of the ISO {{metric screw thread}} are predicted. The force model is composed of surface and edge force components. The cutting edge is modelled from the geometry of the milling cutter, including the helix angle and <b>thread</b> <b>tooth</b> profile. To determine the specific cutting force coefficients for surface and edge force components, the cutting forces are measured with a dynamometer along a horizontal linear path and compared with the calculated force {{by means of the}} exact uncut chip thickness which results from the modelling of chip volume per tooth at a prescribed time on the thread milling cutter. The run-out errors are considered to estimate the uneven cutting force distribution for each tooth. The measured cutting forces for the brass workpiece material (CuZn 37) for a linear path shows quite good agreement with the simulated cutting forces. The results indicate that the proposed cutting force model for thread milling can be used in order to adapt cutting parameters, such as feed per tooth and axial depth of cut for the purpose of increasing productivity in practical application...|$|E

40|$|Loading {{and contact}} stress {{distribution}} on the <b>thread</b> <b>teeth</b> in tubing and casing premium threaded connections are {{of great importance}} for design optimization, pretightening force control, and thread failure prevention. This paper proposes an analytical method based on the elastic mechanics. This {{is quite different from}} other papers, which mainly rely on finite element analysis. The differential equation of load distribution on the <b>thread</b> <b>teeth</b> was established according to equal pitch of the engaged thread after deformation and solved by finite difference method. Furthermore, the relation between load acting on each engaged thread and mean contact stress on its load flank is set up based on the geometric description of thread surface. By comparison, this new analytical method with the finite element analysis for a modified API 177. 8 [*]mm premium threaded connection is approved. Comparison of the contact stress on the last engaged thread between analytical model and FEM shows that the accuracy of analytical model will decline with the increase of pretightening force after the material enters into plastic deformation. However, the analytical method can meet the needs of engineering to some extent because its relative error is about 6. 2 %~ 18. 1 % for the in-service level of pretightening force...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThread milling {{has become}} quite popular {{in recent years}} as an {{alternative}} to tapping or other forms of threading because of diversity and complexity of parts and flexibility of the process in industries such as biomedical applications, aerospace and die-mold manufacturing. Today the design of the tooth profile is, however, predominantly feasible by the expertise and “trial and error” principle. Presented in this paper are a novel methodology to design the tooth profile of the thread mill by comparing the “to-be” thread profile and the “as-is” thread profile which is analyzed by means of NC cutting simulation. The simulation kernel enables to continually subtract the swept volume of thread milling cutter undergoing helical movement from the workpiece and to calculate the virtual workpiece (VWP). Combined with the standardized “to-be” <b>thread</b> profile, the <b>tooth</b> profile of to-be-designed thread mill is adaptively modified until the thread profile on VWP and the “to-be” thread profile become congruent with each other. The proposed methodology could be integrated into CAD/CAM systems...|$|R

When minimal bone width is present, implant placement becomes a challenge and often resulting in recession and dehiscence around the implant that leads to subsequent gingival recession. To correct such defect, the author turned to soft tissue autografting and allografting to correct a buccal dehiscence around tooth # 24 after a malpositioned implant placed by a different surgeon. A 25 -year-old woman presented with the chief complaint of gingival recession and exposure of implant <b>threads</b> around <b>tooth</b> # 24. The patient received three soft tissue grafting procedures to augment the gingival tissue. The first surgery included a connective tissue graft to increase {{the width of the}} keratinized gingival tissue. The second surgery included the use of autografting (connective tissue graft) to coronally position the soft tissue and achieve implant coverage. The third and final surgery included the use of allografting material Alloderm to increase and mask the implant from showing through the gingiva. Healing period was uneventful for the patient. After three surgical procedures, it appears that soft tissue grafting has increased the width and height of the gingiva surrounding the implant. The accomplished thickness of gingival tissue appeared to mask the showing of implant threads through the gingival tissue and allowed for achieving the desired esthetic that the patient desired. The aim of the study is to present a clinical case with soft tissue grafting procedures. Keywords: case report, connective tissue, dental implants, allograft, coronally positioned fla...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Processing through {{volumetric}} cold {{plastic deformation}} (cold rolling) with flat wedge tools is a procedure used in mass production to process profiles (circular, <b>threads,</b> grooves, <b>teeth)</b> on revolution pieces. Complex profiles obtained by cold plastic deformation with flat wedge tools have important advantages: material economy, high productivity, continuous fibre, superior mechanic properties, low {{values of the}} roughness parameters, low costs. In recent years, the simulation of processes of volumetric plastic deformation by the finite element method is used to obtain the optimization of the deformation process and {{the improvement of the}} product quality even from the design stage. By numerical simulation there is observed the evolution during the process of different parameters such as: stress and deformations in the deformed body, mode of material flow, final shape and sizes of the product etc. Therefore, it becomes possible to analyse the process even from the design stage by identifying the problems which can appear and their influence on some characteristics of the product obtained: geometry, state of deformations and stress. This paper presents the experimental determination of the deformation force at the processing of complex profiles with flat wedge tools and the influence of the friction coefficient between tool and semi-product on its value; influence established by simulating the deformation process. The process also has been simulated by means of finite element calculations using the Abaqus/Explicit code. The material behaviour is described by using a 5 -parameter strain-hardening law and by accounting for thermal effects at high strain-rates. The comparison between the values and the variation of the deformation force recorded experimentally and at simulation allows establishing the optimal value of the friction coefficient and validating the numerical model developed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{present results}} of a survey {{on the status of}} an {{implantology}} amongst implant-practicing dentist across the world in 2009. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire was sent to the members of EAO (European Association of Osseointegration), ICOI (International Congress of Osseointegrated Implants), ISOI (Indian Society of Oral Implantologists), Asian Academy of Osseointegration (AAO), Deutsche Gasellschaft Fur Orale Implantologie (DGOI), Philippines Implant Organization, Korean Society of Oral Implantologist, Japanese Association of OralIimplantologists, Chinese Dental Association, Pakistan Dental Association, asking for the personal (anonymous) background data and their implantology concepts. Specific questions dealt with level of recognition of implants, use of implants, superstructures, techniques followed, and materials used. Results: A total of 1500 (63. 6 %) of the 2358 questionnaires were answered. Dental implants were the most preferred treatment modality for restoring the missing <b>teeth.</b> <b>Threaded</b> implants were the most preferred.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{laboratory}} tests {{were performed to}} study the mechanical behaviours of newly developed high strength rock bolt components, including rebar, thread, plate, and domed washer. The characteristics of deformation and damage of each component were presented. The stress distribution of plate and domed washer was investigated through finite element modelling. The numerical {{results show that the}} yield and tensile strengths of the developed high strength rebar are 33. 6 %– 58. 3 % and 17. 2 %– 28. 7 % greater than those of the conventional rebar, respectively. The increase in yield strength was higher than that in tensile strength, suggesting an increase in yield to tensile strength ratio and a decrease in elongation. It is well-known that the thread processing may not be of high precision and accuracy as expected, which is characterised as rough <b>thread</b> surface, non-identical <b>tooth</b> height, toe stripping, and cracks in the surface. Hardening during thread processing tends to increase the thread yield and tensile strengths. In this paper, the typical deformation process of arch-shaped plate is classified into five stages. The tested plates exhibited distinct deformation characteristics and bearing capacities due to variations in shape, size, material and presence of washer. It was observed that uneven bottom surface, low bearing arch and large radius of the transitional arc connecting bearing arch and bottom surface were the major reasons accounting for low load-bearing capacity of plates. The performance of domed washer has a close relation with the shape, size, strength, and deformation compatibility with plate. Stress concentration was observed {{on the periphery of the}} contact surface between domed washer and plate, which is significantly influenced by the strength of domed washer and is considered to be 20 %– 30 % higher than that of plate. Finally, a case study in the Datong coal mining district was presented, and the support pattern and effect of the developed rock bolt were described...|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} {{thread accuracy}} in {{details of the}} machine-building production results from the improved design and manufacturing stages of threading tools. In modern industry, thread milling cutters gain an increasingly greater spread for thread manufacturing. Preliminary {{studies have shown that}} improving the accuracy of a cut thread is closely connected with the task of profiling the <b>teeth</b> of the <b>thread</b> milling cutters with helical flutes, and the accuracy of the solution depends on the face profile of the tool into the end section. In addition, the face profile of the tool is required to solve problems related to the calculation of strength thread milling cutters and evaluation of geometrical parameters of the teeth. The analysis of GOST 1336 - 77 on thread milling cutters showed that there are no geometric and structural parameters characterizing the end thread milling cutters with helical flutes. Since the standard presents thread milling cutters with a straight flutes, in which the shape of the tooth profile cutters of the second order is the same as in normal and end sections, for cutters with helical flutes it is necessary {{to solve the problem of}} conversion of normal and end sections to get the desired shape of the cutting edge. In order to assess the face profile, the end mills of high speed steel and carbide have been analyzed to show that the vast majority of the face profile of the tooth is specified in the normal section line, which is taken as an input in determining the function of the profile form for the face of the end section of the <b>teeth</b> <b>thread</b> milling cutter with helical flutes. The paper solves the problem of calculating the coordinates of the profile of the endsection of a tooth cutters with helical flutes adopted at the original tooth profile in normal section. It has been verified by modeling software CATIA V 5 R 17. An example illustrates finding the function form of the end section. Calculations have shown that in the end section of a tooth there is a curve described by a second-degree polynomial with a high degree of accuracy. The data obtained can be used to correct <b>tooth</b> profile <b>thread</b> milling cutters to improve the accuracy of the obtained thread. </p...|$|R
