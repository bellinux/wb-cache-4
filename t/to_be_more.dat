5|$|A {{study of}} {{vigilance}} behaviour of herds revealed that individuals on {{the borders of}} herds tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> cautious; vigilance decreases with group size. Group size and distance from roads and bushes {{were found to have}} major influence on vigilance, more among the grazing springbok than among their browsing counterparts. Adults were found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> vigilant than juveniles, and males more vigilant than females. Springbok passing through bushes tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> vulnerable to predator attacks as they can not be easily alerted, and predators usually conceal themselves in bushes. Another study calculated that the time spent in vigilance by springbok on the edges of herds is roughly double that spent by those in the centre and the open. Springbok were found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> cautious in the late morning than at dawn or in the afternoon, and more at night than in the daytime. Rates and methods of vigilance were found to vary with the aim of lowering risk from predators.|$|E

5|$|Agnolín and Novas (2013) found Archaeopteryx and (possibly synonymous) Wellnhoferia {{to be the}} basalmost avialans (Avialae being {{defined by}} the authors as {{including}} Archaeopteryx lithographica and Passer, their most recent common ancestor {{and all of its}} descendants), with Microraptoria, Unenlagiinae, and the clade containing Anchiornis and Xiaotingia being successively closer outgroups to the Avialae. Another phylogenetic study by Godefroit, et al., using a more inclusive matrix than the one from the analysis in the description of Eosinopteryx brevipenna, also found Archaeopteryx {{to be a member of}} Avialae (defined by the authors as the most inclusive clade containing Passer domesticus, but not Dromaeosaurus albertensis or Troodon formosus). Archaeopteryx was found to form a grade at the base of Avialae with Xiaotingia, Anchiornis, and Aurornis. Compared to Archaeopteryx, Xiaotingia was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> closely related to extant birds, while both Anchiornis and Aurornis were found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> distantly so.|$|E
