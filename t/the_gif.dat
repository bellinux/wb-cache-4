25|$|<b>The</b> <b>GIF</b> Specification allows {{each image}} within the logical screen of a GIF file to specify {{that it is}} interlaced; i.e., that {{the order of the}} raster lines in its data block is not sequential. This allows a partial display of the image that can be {{recognized}} before the full image is painted.|$|E
25|$|The {{motivation}} {{for creating the}} PNG format was in early 1995, after it became known that the Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW) data compression algorithm used in the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) format was patented by Unisys. There were also other problems with <b>the</b> <b>GIF</b> format that made a replacement desirable, notably its limit of 256 colors {{at a time when}} computers able to display far more than 256 colors were becoming common.|$|E

40|$|BDF 1 [(C 57 BL/ 6 X DBA/ 2) F 1] mice were primed with alum-absorbed {{ovalbumin}}, {{and their}} spleen cells were cultured with ovalbumin to activate antigen-primed T cells. The activated T cells were then propagated in interleukin 2 -containing medium {{in the presence}} or absence of affinity-purified glycosylation-inhibiting factor (GIF). Upon incubation with ovalbumin-pulsed macrophages, T cells propagated in <b>the</b> absence of <b>GIF</b> produced IgE-potentiating factor and glycosylation-enhancing factor. In contrast, T cells propagated in <b>the</b> presence of <b>GIF</b> produced IgE-suppressive factor and <b>GIF.</b> <b>The</b> ovalbumin-primed T cells propagated in <b>the</b> presence of <b>GIF</b> constitutively produced <b>the</b> 13 -kDa <b>GIF</b> that lacked affinity for ovalbumin. However, stimulation of the same T cells with ovalbumin-pulsed macrophages resulted in the production of 80 - and 35 -kDa GIF that had affinity for ovalbumin. Both <b>the</b> antigen-specific <b>GIF</b> and nonspecific <b>GIF</b> from <b>the</b> activated BDF 1 T cells had I-Jb determinants. Since <b>the</b> ovalbumin-specific <b>GIF</b> is derived from Lyt- 2 +, I-J+ ovalbumin-specific suppressor T cells and suppresses the anti-hapten antibody response to dinitrophenyl-coupled ovalbumin, the results strongly suggest that <b>the</b> presence of <b>GIF</b> during <b>the</b> propagation of antigen-primed T cells facilitates the generation of antigen-specific suppressor T cells...|$|R
40|$|We {{obtained}} human T-cell hybridomas {{that are}} specific for bee venom phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) and constitutively secrete glycosylation inhibiting factor (GIF). Upon crosslinking of CD 3, <b>the</b> hybridoma produced <b>GIF</b> having affinity for PLA 2. When affinity-purified PLA 2 -binding GIF {{was used as}} an immunogen, monoclonal antibodies specific for <b>the</b> antigen-binding <b>GIF</b> were obtained. Monoclonal antibody 110 BH 3 bound <b>the</b> antigen-binding <b>GIF</b> but failed to bind the 13 -kDa nonspecific GIF, as determined by both bioassay and ELISA. In contrast, 388 F 1, a monoclonal antibody against nonspecific GIF, gave ELISA signals with both <b>the</b> nonspecific <b>GIF</b> and <b>the</b> antigen-binding <b>GIF.</b> Gel filtration of affinity-purified antigen-binding <b>GIF</b> revealed <b>the</b> presence of a 72 - to 80 -kDa protein which gave ELISA signals with both 110 BH 3 and 388 F 1 and contained GIF bioactivity. Upon reduction and alkylation, <b>the</b> antigen-binding <b>GIF</b> dissociated into a 62 - to 64 -kDa protein which gave positive ELISA with antibody 110 BH 3 but no signal with antibody 388 F 1, and a 15 -kDa protein, which gave ELISA signal with the 388 F 1 but not with 110 BH 3. Immunoblotting of a PLA 2 -binding GIF preparation revealed that under reducing conditions, <b>the</b> antigen-binding <b>GIF</b> dissociated a 13 -kDa peptide which reacted with polyclonal antibodies against recombinant <b>GIF.</b> <b>The</b> results indicate that the 13 -kDa nonspecific GIF is a subunit of antigen-binding <b>GIF.</b> <b>The</b> PLA 2 -binding GIF has affinity for an epitope, representing amino acid residues 19 - 28 in PLA 2 which appears to be an external structure in the antigen...|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>GIF</b> {{encoding}} {{process can}} be modified to create a file without LZW compression that is still viewable as a GIF image. This technique was introduced originally {{as a way to}} avoid patent infringement. Uncompressed GIF can also be a useful intermediate format for a graphics programmer because individual pixels are accessible for reading or painting. An uncompressed GIF file can be converted to an ordinary GIF file simply by passing it through an image editor.|$|E
25|$|Many techniques, collectively called dithering, {{have been}} {{developed}} to approximate a wider range of colors with a small color palette by using pixels of two or more colors to approximate in-between colors. These techniques sacrifice spatial resolution to approximate deeper color resolution. While not part of <b>the</b> <b>GIF</b> specification, dithering can of course be used in images subsequently encoded as GIF images. This is often not an ideal solution for GIF images, both because the loss of spatial resolution typically makes an image look fuzzy on the screen, and because the dithering patterns often interfere with the compressibility of the image data, working against GIF's main purpose.|$|E
25|$|By default, however, an {{animation}} {{displays the}} sequence of frames only once, stopping when the last frame is displayed. Since GIF is designed to allow users to define new blocks, Netscape in the 1990s used the Application Extension block (intended to allow vendors to add application-specific information to <b>the</b> <b>GIF</b> file) to implement the Netscape Application Block (NAB). This block, placed immediately before all the animation frames, specifies {{the number of times}} {{the sequence of}} frames should be played. (The value 0 signifies continuous display.) Support for these repeating animations first appeared in Netscape Navigator version 2.0, and then spread to other browsers. Most browsers now recognize and support NAB, though it is not strictly part of the GIF89a specification.|$|E

25|$|If {{the symbol}} width is n, the codes of width n+1 fall {{naturally}} into two blocks: the lower block of 2n codes for coding single symbols, {{and the upper}} block of 2n codes {{that will be used}} by the decoder for sequences of length greater than one. Of that upper block, the first two codes are already taken: 2n for CLEAR and 2n + 1 for STOP. The decoder must also be prevented from using the last code in the upper block, 2n+1 − 1, because when the decoder fills that slot, it will increase the code width. Thus in the upper block there are 2n − 3 codes available to the decoder that won't trigger an increase in code width. Because the decoder is always one step behind in maintaining the table, it does not generate a table entry upon receiving the first code from the encoder, but will generate one for each succeeding code. Thus the encoder can generate 2n − 2 codes without triggering an increase in code width. Therefore the encoder must emit extra CLEAR codes at intervals of 2n − 2 codes or less to make the decoder reset the coding dictionary. <b>The</b> <b>GIF</b> standard allows such extra CLEAR codes to be inserted in the image data at any time. The composite data stream is partitioned into sub-blocks that each carry from 1 to 255 bytes.|$|E

[...] Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode a scathing review, only awarding it 1/10. He criticized the seriousness of the plot and wrote, [...] "Overall, this has {{to be one of the}} worst episodes of the series. In nearly every possible way, the episode fails to live up to the usual expectations. Perhaps aware of how silly the whole thing sounds, the cast and crew seem weary of it all from beginning to end.

[...] Cyriaque Lamar from i09 called the Jaguar Spirit one of [...] "The 10 Most Ridiculous X-Files Monsters" [...] and wrote, [...] "In this fairly ridiculous Season 3 episode, an Ecuadorian artifact possessed by a Jaguar Spirit (or something) causes tabbies to go bonkers and murder people.

40|$|The Earth {{was born}} in violence. Many giant {{collisions}} of protoplanets {{are thought to have}} occurred during the terrestrial planet formation. Here we investigated the giant impact stage by using a hybrid code that consistently deals with the orbital evolution of protoplanets around the Sun and the details of processes during giant impacts between two protoplanets. A significant amount of materials (up to several tens of percent of the total mass of the protoplanets) is ejected by giant impacts. We call these ejected fragments <b>the</b> giant-impact fragments (<b>GIFs).</b> In some of the erosive hit-and-run and high-velocity collisions, metallic iron is also ejected, which comes from the colliding protoplanets' cores. From ten numerical simulations for the giant impact stage, we found that the mass fraction of metallic iron in GIFs ranges from ~ 1 wt% to ~ 25 wt%. We also discussed the effects of <b>the</b> <b>GIFs</b> on <b>the</b> dynamical and geochemical characteristics of formed terrestrial planets. We found that <b>the</b> <b>GIFs</b> have <b>the</b> potential to solve the following dynamical and geochemical conflicts: (1) The Earth, currently in a near circular orbit, is likely to have had a highly eccentric orbit during the giant impact stage. <b>The</b> <b>GIFs</b> are large enough in total mass to lower the eccentricity of the Earth to its current value via their dynamical friction. (2) The concentrations of highly siderophile elements (HSEs) in the Earth's mantle are greater than what was predicted experimentally. Re-accretion of <b>the</b> iron-bearing <b>GIFs</b> onto <b>the</b> Earth can contribute to the excess of HSEs. In addition, the estimated amount of iron-bearing GIFs provides significant reducing agent that could transform primitive CO 2 -H 2 O atmosphere and ocean into more reducing H 2 -bearing atmosphere. Thus, GIFs are important for the origin of Earth's life and its early evolution. Comment: Accepted for publication in Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 33 pages, 7 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R
