5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Zappa met Ray Collins. Collins {{supported}} himself by {{working as a}} carpenter, and on weekends sang with {{a group called the}} Soul Giants. Collins got into a fight with their guitar player, who quit, leaving the band in need of a substitute, and Zappa filled in. The Soul Giants' repertoire originally consisted of R covers; though after Zappa joined the band he encouraged them to play his own original material and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> record contract. While most of the band members liked the idea, then-leader and saxophone player Davy Coronado felt that performing original material would cost them bookings, and quit the band. The Soul Giants became the Mothers and Zappa took over leadership of the band.|$|E

5|$|In November 2011, provincial government-appointed {{auditors}} {{backed up}} claims by Ocean Choice International (OCI) {{that they were}} losing millions of dollars each year operating the Marystown fish plant. On December 2, 2011, the company announced that they would permanently close their Marystown and Port Union fish processing plants and invest money into other plants throughout the province. The following week OCI asked the provincial government for an exemption to export unprocessed fish in return for nearly doubling the workforce at the company's plant in Fortune. Minister King reacted positively to the proposed idea and said the government would consider it. Negotiations on a deal would become tense, with the minister criticizing the company for using 'pressure tactics' to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> deal. OCI {{said that they were}} in damage control all around the world because of Minister King's comments. In February 2012, the government rejected a proposal to drop MPRs for the company, saying that it was not {{in the best interest of}} the province. In mid October 2012, workers at the Fortune fish plant voted unanimously in favour of allowing OCI to ship out raw fish to China for processing, in return for 110 full-time jobs at their plant. The FFAW, which represented the workers, opposed the move to ship out the raw product. Dunderdale held a cabinet shuffle on October 19, 2012, and appointed Tourism Minister Derrick Dalley as the new Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture. In a news conference held on December 21, 2012, Minister Dalley announced the government would allow Ocean Choice International to ship 75 per cent of its yellowtail flounder quota overseas for processing, along with 100 per cent of its redfish quota. In return a total of 236 year-round jobs, between the Fortune fish plant and on company vessels at sea, for at least five years.|$|E

Silverman and Seder later made a six-episode television series sequel entitled Pilot Season in which Silverman stars as the same character and Seder again directed. She made her network standup comedy debut on the Late Show with David Letterman on July 3 of 1997.|$|E

25|$|The ridge southward to Swirl How {{is named}} Top of Broad Slack, Broad Slack being a ferociously steep grass slope {{climbing}} out of Greenburn between the crags. This {{is the site of}} a wartime aircrash and bears the sad remains of a Royal Canadian Air Force Handley Page Halifax bomber. The undercarriage, together with a wooden cross and memorial cairn is {{on the top of the}} ridge with the rest of the wreckage spread down Broad Slack. During a night time navigation exercise in 1944, the RCAF Halifax from RAF Topcliffe became lost in thick cloud while over the north west of England. In an attempt to wait out the blanket of grey, they circled in hope the cloud would clear, ultimately becoming hopelessly lost. To <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> visual fix for the navigator, the pilot dropped the bomber out of the cloud base, with no knowledge of what was below him. Unfortunately, for both him, the crew and the aircraft, they were greeted by the great rising fells of Swirl How and Great Carrs. With no time to react, the aircraft hit the mountainside killing all on board. Despite the crew perishing in the impact, the bomber remained largely intact and, to prevent other aircraft from spotting it and reporting it repeatedly, the wreckage was cut into a number of smaller, moveable pieces and discarded down Broad Slack, where parts of it are still visible today. Over the years, two of the four Rolls-Royce engines were recovered from the crash site by an RAF helicopter, one of which is now on display at the Ruskin Museum in Coniston. In contrast to the craggy scarp of the east face, the western slope of the ridge descends over grass to the col of Fairfield, forming a tilted triangular plateau. Across Fairfield is the rocky top of Grey Friar.|$|E

500|$|After Wilde {{left the}} court, {{a warrant for}} his arrest was applied for on charges of sodomy and gross indecency. Robbie Ross found Wilde at the Cadogan Hotel, Knightsbridge, with Reginald Turner; both men advised Wilde to go at once to Dover and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> boat to France; his mother advised him to stay and fight. Wilde, lapsing into inaction, could only say, [...] "The train has gone. It's too late." [...] Wilde was arrested for [...] "gross indecency" [...] under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, a term meaning {{homosexual}} acts not amounting to buggery (an offence under a separate statute). At Wilde's instruction, Ross and Wilde's butler forced {{their way into the}} bedroom and library of 16 Tite Street, packing some personal effects, manuscripts, and letters. Wilde was then imprisoned on remand at Holloway where he received daily visits from Douglas.|$|E
500|$|When {{determining}} {{the style of}} 3D shooting they wanted to use, Burg felt that the audience would want several moments where objects move into the audience, comparing this to My Bloody Valentine 3D. He acknowledged that this method would be used, but {{expressed an interest in}} shooting from the victim's perspective, similar to that of first-person shooter video games being rendered in 3D. Dunstan added that [...] "It adds a whole new layer of discipline and criteria to creating these moments. We've had a very flat surface to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> reaction out of you. Now, we get to push out a bit and envelop the viewer, still maintaining the patterns that have worked and been successful, but also to raise it up a notch." [...] Commenting on the change to filming in 3D, Bell stated it would not affect his performance or methods of acting, noting that it would be an [...] "interesting experience". Mandylor called the 3D shoot [...] "more tedious and longer". Flannery described the 3D aspect as being [...] " [...] shot in 3D so that you can, perse, see blood coming directly at you. It's in 3D for the texture and the depth, for the architecture, to get a sense that you're in the scene but there's no 'we want to see blood coming at the lens' it's nothing like that. But I think we made a good movie." [...] Post-production services were provided by Deluxe.|$|E
500|$|The {{next day}} after {{defeating}} Hampshire, Somerset faced the MCC at Taunton. The MCC {{had brought a}} strong team, including eight professionals, and on winning the toss they elected to bat. After a cautious start, the second-wicket partnership of Billy Gunn and William Hearn put on 173 runs together, {{and according to the}} Western Daily Press, [...] "the Somerset bowling was completely mastered." [...] Somerset tried eight different bowlers to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> wicket, but the partnership was eventually broken when Hearn was run out for 91. Frank Hearne then joined Gunn at the crease, and the pair continued the MCC's dominance, adding a further 130 runs. Another run out, again due to the fielding of Newton, brought Gunn's innings to an end, after the MCC batsman had scored 188 runs. Wickets then began to fall more frequently; Roe collected three, while Fothergill and Winter had two apiece, and the MCC were eventually all out for 506 on the second morning. In their response, Somerset lost the early wickets of Sainsbury and Newton, but then a partnership between Fowler and Roe took the score up to 181, during which Fowler reached his century, coming in just 55 minutes. Once that partnership was ended with the dismissal of Roe, Somerset regularly lost wickets. Fowler was caught in the slips for 139, which had included three sixes, and Somerset ended their innings on 286. They followed on, and lost five early wickets before a partnership between Francis Terry, who scored 77 runs, and Fothergill steadied the innings and help Somerset secure a draw.|$|E

2500|$|Regular {{admission}} {{is a good}} choice for students who are unsure where they would like to go. One advantage is that it can help students who have improved their grades substantially in the fall of twelfth grade, since decisions are not made until March of that year. In addition, it offers students more time to make their decision about a college under somewhat less pressure than an early method. The fairly dominant view is that regular {{admission is}} more likely to result in higher offers of financial aid, particularly if students are admitted to several institutions that present different aid offers. Accordingly, one offer can be used as leverage to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> better offer at another institution, particularly if there are competing multiple acceptances. Several reports suggested that a [...] "growing number of colleges" [...] including Harvard, Cornell, and Carnegie-Mellon have stated publicly that they will consider matching offers from competing colleges.

2500|$|Environmental Golf Course Design is an {{integral}} part of Hurdzan's golf course design style, which has been appreciated by golf lovers through his design of the Widow's Walk Golf Course in Scituate, Massachusetts (opened in 1996) and the Harbor Links Golf Course in North Hempstead, New York. In Howard Richman's article Man with the plans in the Golf Course Management (GCM) Magazine of December 2012, Hurdzan explained his golf course design approach in these words: [...] "Form follows function — you'll hear that a lot around here," [...] Hurdzan says. [...] "The form is something that is a direct result of the function it has to serve. That is why I work so closely with superintendents. I ask them 'How are you going to mow that?' … 'How are you going to rake that?' … 'Are you going to be able to irrigate that?' I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> superintendent to think ahead. I don't want to leave them with problems. I want to leave them with solutions. That's why I like to get them involved." ...|$|E
