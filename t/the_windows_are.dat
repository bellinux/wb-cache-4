5|$|The building's {{southern}} facade, that of {{the original}} 1883 room, features three windows. The same room has two rear windows of the same style. <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> all double hung and of four-over-four design.|$|E
5|$|The main façade (south elevation) of Literary Hall {{is divided}} into three bays, and its west and east {{elevations}} are divided into five bays. Each of the building's bays consists of a double-hung sash wooden window, with nine panes of glass within each sash. <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> symmetrically placed within recessed brick panels that are defined at the first and second stories of the building with elementary brick ribs, or pseudo-pilasters, that form the outer surface of the building's exterior walls and provide separation of the three bays of the main façade and the five bays of the west and east elevations. <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> framed by white wooden louvered window shutters. The building's brick is laid in an American bond pattern, with five courses of stretchers between every course of headers.|$|E

5|$|The building, though {{based on}} Classical {{architecture}} {{is not entirely}} a Classical building. Its rooflines, main entrance, and the placement and style of <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> all asymmetrical in nature, {{a hallmark of the}} Arts and Crafts style. Its simple massing and noticeable lack of ornamentation throughout the structure connects the building closely to the Arts and Crafts movement. This influence is seen most prominently on the building's interior.|$|E
5|$|The {{courthouse}} is elaborately windowed. Some windows, {{mostly on}} the first floor are straight topped. On the second floor most of <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> topped with limestone arches. The original, wood-framed windows were replaced in 1972. The building's two main entrances feature stone arches over recessed doors; eleven step stairways lead to both doors. New doors were installed in both entrances in 1971.|$|E
5|$|A slender chancel arch existed {{until the}} mid-19th century and might have been pre-Conquest, but the {{earliest}} visible extant part {{of the church is}} the 13th-century north arcade, which may have been added to an earlier, now-lost, nave. The spire and tower date {{to the middle of the}} next century, roughly when the nave was rebuilt. Many of <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> reticulated in a fashion popular during the early 14th century. Several medieval bequests are known: Olivia, wife of John Rossen of Quarrington, left 12 pence to the rector and church each in 1412; a donation of wool was made by another parishioner, Joan, wife of William Ward, around the same time. Later, 8 pence was left to the churchwardens by an unknown resident.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{examination}} by {{stained glass}} experts, <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> revealed {{to have been}} designed and crafted by Louis Comfort Tiffany, {{the son of the}} founder of Tiffany & Co. [...] Twelve of <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> consisted of geometric and floral patterns mingled with religious symbols. The thirteenth and largest window depicted Jesus with his hand raised in benediction. Experts determined that <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> dedicated to E. St. Clair Thompson, a wealthy Freemason interred at Abbey Mausoleum in 1933. [...] <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> probably commissioned by the Thompson family. Many of <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> damaged by vandalism, and most had suffered cracks, fading, and missing pieces due to neglect and age.|$|R

5|$|After {{the land}} had been surveyed, the first buyer was the Education Board, {{securing}} {{land for a}} school in the market square, and a teacher's house on the adjacent section. Both these buildings were also built in concrete and exist to this day. The school was built to a northern hemisphere design and has windows {{on the south side}} only to stop children from becoming distracted, but <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> on the wrong side to utilise the sun. Since the school closed in 1938 it has been used for functions and as a hall. The former teacher's house is used as a bach. Both buildings are owned by Ashburton District Council.|$|E
5|$|Every {{window in}} the church {{contains}} coloured glass (except the two tiny windows in the chapel of St Padarn). <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> mostly narrow single lancets, and {{at the ends of}} the transepts and at the west end are arranged one and two. Some are possibly mediaeval, in the same eroded yellow stone as the quoins. The west and south gables have three windows, spaced two below and one above. The north has two only window. There are four lancets to the nave on the north, with three and the porch to the south. The transepts also have single lancet windows east and west. The north transept has a nineteenth century two-light east window with the relieving arch of an older window well above.|$|E
5|$|Rose Hill {{is largely}} {{made up of}} nineteenth-century architecture, with some {{contemporary}} buildings. The campus is home to several structures on the National Register of Historic Places, such as the University Church built in 1845 as a seminary chapel and parish church for the surrounding community. It contains the altar from Old St. Patrick's Cathedral, as well as stained glass windows given to the university by King Louis Philippe I of France. <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> particularly notable for their connection to a workshop in Sevres, France, locus of the earliest stages of the Gothic Revival. Adjacent to the church is a 138-plot cemetery where the university's nineteenth-century Jesuits, diocesan seminarians, students, and workers are interred, relocated in 1890 from its original location at today's New York Botanical Garden.|$|E
50|$|A {{few months}} later on November 1, <b>the</b> <b>window</b> {{ceremony}} <b>was</b> held and <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>was</b> put up in Main Street, U.S.A. forever leaving a mark.|$|R

5000|$|WindowShade was {{a control}} panel {{extension}} for the classic Mac OS that allowed a user to double-click a window's title bar to [...] "roll up" [...] <b>the</b> <b>window</b> like a windowshade. When <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>was</b> [...] "rolled up", only the title bar of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>was</b> visible; <b>the</b> <b>window's</b> content area disappeared, allowing easier manipulation of <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> on <b>the</b> screen.|$|R
5|$|The Church {{is built}} in the 13th century English Gothic style in coursed ragstone with a red-tiled roof and a central wooden belfry, topped by a splayed-foot spire and small dormers at the west end. The plan is of an aisle-less nave with a lower chancel, north chapel and south porch with a stair tower for the gallery (all at {{the west end of}} the church), with a sacristy linking it to the presbytery in the {{north-east}} corner. <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> of Bath stone.|$|E
5|$|The chapel walls {{have three}} {{horizontal}} tiers with six {{windows in the}} upper tier down each side. There were also two windows at each end, but these have been closed up above the altar when Michelangelo's Last Judgement was painted, obliterating two lunettes. Between <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> large pendentives which support the vault. Between the pendentives are triangularly shaped arches or spandrels cut into the vault above each window. Above {{the height of the}} pendentives, the ceiling slopes gently without much deviation from the horizontal. This is the real architecture. Michelangelo has elaborated it with illusionary or fictive architecture.|$|E
5|$|The end bays of {{the west}} (main) facade are framed in pedimented pavilions, which have {{recessed}} brick panels above the impost line, and below it are bricks coursed to resemble rustication. One glazed roundel is at the middle of each tympanum. The pedimented central bay has an arched recessed entrance {{with a pair of}} oversized double wood doors beneath a fanlight. The arch is flanked with blind roundels above the impost line, with rustication below. The bay's tympanum is undecorated. The arch impost line continues as a belt course between the pavilions and forms the sills for recessed wood-framed, fixed-sashed, nine-light windows on the building's second level. <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> divided by Doric pilasters.|$|E

30|$|Graph entropy can {{reflect the}} degree of {{difference}} in the gray values of pixels. With a smaller value of graph entropy, the spatial distribution of energy within <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>is</b> more uniform and {{the difference in the}} gray values of pixels is weaker. When the gray values of all pixels within <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> same, the graph entropy reaches the minimum that is H[*]=[*] 0. On the contrary, when the entropy value is greater, the difference in the gray values of pixels within <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>is</b> big due to the existence of blob targets.|$|R
50|$|The direct {{children}} of <b>the</b> root <b>window</b> <b>are</b> called top-level <b>windows.</b> These <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> usually drawn with a decorative frame and a title bar (which are actually added by <b>the</b> <b>window</b> manager). <b>The</b> top-level <b>windows</b> <b>are,</b> informally, <b>the</b> regular <b>windows</b> in <b>the</b> terminology of most GUIs. <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> that <b>are</b> not top-level {{are used for}} buttons, textboxes, etc.|$|R
5|$|The {{ground floor}} in Merchants Street was {{designed}} {{so as to}} house eight shops, {{four on each side}} of the main doorway. Each shop has another room above, reached by an individual spiral staircase, which space was intended as a home for the owners. These rooms above the shops have a window each, forming eight square windows on the façade, one above each entrance of a shop. <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> decorated with the symbolic crescents of Pinto. At one point, the space of one of the shops was converted to become accessible from the main building to be used as offices for the Ministry for Health. On the same street, the first floor has the same number of windows however are larger and with conspicuous window frames.|$|E
5|$|The three-storey {{north tower}} is reached by a 13th-century {{staircase}} in the hall, which leads onto the first floor. The first floor {{was divided into}} two separate rooms shortly after {{the construction of the}} tower, and contain various decorative tiles, probably from Laurence's house in Ludlow. The walls of the second floor are mostly half-timbered, jettying out above the stone walls beneath them; the tower has its original 13th-century fireplace, although the wooden roof is 19th-century, modeled on the 13th-century original, and <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> 17th-century insertions. The details and the carpenters' personal marks on the woodwork show that the hall, solar and north tower were all constructed {{under the direction of the}} same carpenter in the late 1280s and early 1290s.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{conclusive}} evidence explaining why the Dibbles chose to place Gothic {{windows on the}} upper level. <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> {{believed to have been}} purchased through the Sears catalog. There are two commonly accepted theories: the Dibbles may have wanted the windows to beautify their home at a time when rural life in Iowa was a struggle, or they could have been following a trend in which extravagant details were desirable in residences in the late nineteenth century, and the Dibbles chose windows whose costs would have been relatively reasonable at the time.|$|E

5|$|At street level, three arched entranceways line Broad Street. The central arch is {{slightly}} larger than the others to indicate {{the entrance to the}} main banking hall. Carved into the facade above the center arch is the building's name. Inside the arches and above the doorways are windows designed by d'Ascenzo Studios. Leaded panes of glass of various shades of amber are surrounded by a Renaissance-style border. Below <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> bronze doors, each with 24 high-relief panels depicting the history of commerce and civilization. Bas-relief figures decorate each of the arches' spandrels. A male figure with a hammer representing industry and a female figure with a beehive representing thrift decorate the center arch. The arch closest to Sansom Street is decorated by two figures with cornucopias to represent abundance. The arch nearer to Walnut Street is decorated by a painter and a sculptor to represent art.|$|E
5|$|Previously, the Sistine Chapel's only {{ventilation}} {{was from}} its {{windows in the}} upper level of the walls. To prevent exhaust fumes and wind-blown pollutants from entering, <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> now permanently closed and an air conditioning system has been installed. The installation is by Carrier of the United Technologies Corporation and was developed {{with the cooperation of}} the Vatican's Office of Technical Services. It has been designed to counteract the various problems specific to the Chapel, in particular the rapid changes of heat and humidity that occur with the admission of the first crowds of tourists each morning and the departure of the last visitors each afternoon. The air conditioning varies not only the heat but also the relative humidity between the summer and winter months so that changes to the atmospheric environment occur gradually. The air near the ceiling is kept at a temperate level, while the air in the lower section of the building is cooler and circulates more rapidly, with the effect that dirt particles fall towards the floor rather than being streamed upwards. Bacteria and chemical pollutants are filtered out.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{buildings}} in the new World Trade Center complex, One World Trade Center includes sustainable architecture features. Much of the building's structure and interior is built from recycled materials, including gypsum boards and ceiling tiles; around 80percent of the tower's waste products are recycled. Although the roof area of any tower is limited, the building implements a rainwater collection and recycling scheme for its cooling systems. The building's PureCell phosphoric acid fuel cells generate 4.8megawatts (MW) of power, and its waste steam generates electricity. The New York Power Authority selected UTC Power to provide the tower's fuel cell system, {{which was one of}} the largest fuel cell installations in the world once completed. The tower also makes use of off-site hydroelectric and wind power. <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> made of an ultra-clear glass, which allows maximum sunlight to pass through; the interior lighting is equipped with dimmers that automatically dim the lights on sunny days, reducing energy costs. Like all of the new facilities at the World Trade Center site, One World Trade Center is heated by steam, with limited oil or natural gas utilities on-site. One World Trade Center is expected to receive a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold Certification, making it one of the most environmentally sustainable skyscrapers in the world.|$|E

5000|$|A set {{of windows}} {{designed}} by John La Farge, {{now in the}} collection of the Detroit Institute of Arts, <b>were</b> memorial <b>windows</b> dedicated to three trustees of the First Unitarian Church of Detroit. The central grouping of <b>windows</b> <b>was</b> dedicated to Charles Merrill and features two lancets entitled [...] "Faith" [...] (center left) and [...] "Hope" [...] (center right). The inscription beneath [...] "Hope" [...] comes from Psalm 119, reading [...] "The entrance of thy words giveth light." [...] <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> created in 1899 when the First Unitarian Church of Detroit built the congregation's second site. Eventually, the building was sold to the Church of Christ and <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> removed when <b>the</b> widening of Woodward Avenue was planned in 1936, necessitating a modification and move of the church building. <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> never reinstalled and ultimately all but one of <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> donated to <b>the</b> Detroit Institute of Arts in 1959 by the Unitarian Church Trust. <b>The</b> DIA <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> restored between 1988 and 1991 by Mary Clerkin Higgins and were dedicated in April 1991.|$|R
