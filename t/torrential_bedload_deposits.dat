Central part of the thesis is devoted to the specific issues of the bedload transport on the analysed reach of Kamniška Bistrica between the Stol weir and the Titan weir, where intensive deposition process could be identified using the LIDAR DTM.

40|$|Abstract: A {{detailed}} sediment {{budget has}} been derived for Weany Creek sub-catchment (13. 5 km 2) in North Queensland using SedNet. SedNet is a GIS-based software package originally developed by CSIRO {{for use in}} the Australian National Land and Water Resources Audit (“the Audit”). It was used to assess water quality in the major catchments throughout Australia. We use the term “SubNet ” to refer to the application of SedNet at sub-catchment (or large paddock) scale. SedNet models estimate river sediment loads by constructing material budgets that account for the main sources and stores of sediment. At whole-of-catchment scale, such as in the Audit, SedNet input database requirements (eg. sediment contributors, channel size and condition, and water storage) were impractical to measure. The Audit relied on regionalisation to determine inputs to the model (i. e. used rules to relate mapped environmental/spatial factors to a database of measured/known values). In Weany Creek, we had detailed airphoto and DEM data (providing measurements of vegetation cover, slope, channel width) as well as extensive field measurements (for bank and gully erosion rates, stream flow and suspended sediment concentrations). The Weany Creek SubNet model has been able to show in detail which stream sections (or their associated watersheds) contribute most to suspended sediment loads (and whether it comes from hillslope, or combined gully/bank erosion, or both) as well as where <b>bedload</b> <b>deposits</b> are likely to accumulate. SubNet has provided valuable insight into the meso-scale dynamics of erosion and sediment transport processes and their impacts within the catchment as well as on downstream water quality...|$|R

Using a wide basin incorporating with water supply channeland a longshore current generator. Tests {{have been carried out}} under two broad categories, these being the caseswith and without longshore current. The outflow behaved like a jet at the initial stage of building up a delta. Thesize of delta was progressively advanced mainly in the longitudinal direction of theflow, with the width increased at much slower rate. The suspended sediment settleddown at place far from the river mouth and <b>bedload</b> <b>deposited</b> at its front. Afterthis initial stage of delta formation the advancing speed decreased and the deltabegan to develop laterally. Finally, the delta configuration appeared to be smoothand symmetric, with a steep inclination in the front of delta so-called "fore-set bed",then connected to a much milder slope in its lower portion, which was called"bottom-set bed". In the second category of test, the outflow was strongly affected by the long-shore current. As the center line of the outflow was forced to turn transversely, thedelta appeared to be asymmetric about the original center line. Under the interac-tion of bed configuration and outflow, self adjustment in the plan form was appar-ent, resulting, {{in the direction of the}} outflow being straightened gradually. As a result, the plan shape of the delta became symmetric similar to that ob-tained in the test without longshore current, but the bottom-set bed which wasformed by the suspeded load was always influenced by the longshore current. The grain size distribution on the delta surface was found to be coarser inupstream and finer in downstream. Analyzing the core sampling data it was alsofound that the sediment in the upper layer of the delta was coarser than that inlower layer, and a distinct boundary existed between the coarser and the finersediment...|$|R
40|$|Gravity cores {{obtained}} from isolated seamounts located within, and rising up to 300 m from the sediment-filled Peru-Chile Trench off Southern Central Chile (36 °S- 39 °S) contain numerous turbidite layers which are much coarser than the hemipelagic background sedimentation. The mineralogical composition {{of some of}} the beds indicates a mixed origin from various source terrains while the faunal assemblage of benthic foraminifera in one of the turbidite layers shows a mixed origin from upper shelfal to middle-lower bathyal depths which could indicate a multi-source origin and therefore indicate an earthquake triggering of the causing turbidity currents. The bathymetric setting and the grain size distribution of the sampled layers, together with swath echosounder and sediment echosounder data which monitor the distribution of turbidites on the elevated Nazca Plate allow some estimates on the flow direction, flow velocity and height of the causing turbidity currents. We discuss two alternative models of deposition, both of which imply high (175 - 450 m) turbidity currents and we suggest a channelized transport process as the general mode of turbidite deposition. Whether these turbidites are suspension fallout products of thick turbiditic flows or <b>bedload</b> <b>deposits</b> from sheet-like turbidity currents overwhelming elevated structures cannot be decided upon using our sedimentological data, but the specific morphology of the seamounts rather argues for the first option. Oxygen isotope stratigraphy of one of the cores indicates that the turbiditic sequences were deposited during the last Glacial period and during the following transition period and turbiditic deposition stopped during the Holocene. This climatic coupling seems to be dominant, while the occurrence of megathrust earthquakes provides a trigger mechanism. This seismic triggering takes effect only during times of very high sediment supply to the shelf and slope...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: An {{example of}} a gravelly braided river deposit s {{described}} which exhibits a rather low structural diversity as compared to other ancient and modern braided river sediments. The presented model {{is based on a}} study of the Rhine gravel, formed in front of the Wiirm stage xtension of the Rhine glacier (northern part of Switzerland). The observations in the Rhine gravel suggest that only processes which operate generally at a low topographic level of the braided river system generate a response in the geological record, i. e. (1) pool deposits produced at the junction of two channels (cross-bedded trough fills); (2) channel sediments which reflect hin <b>bedload</b> sheets <b>deposited</b> by moderate-magnitude flowstages with low suspension concentrations; (3) sheet flow deposits produced by extraordinary high-magnitude flow stages with high suspension concentrations, probably due to outbursts from glacial akes. Therefore, we postulate that in the Rhine gravel system {{only a limited number of}} braided river structures have a significant preservation potential: any deposit generated at an elevated geometric level, such as flood plain deposits or bars, are successively destroyed by channel formation and re replaced by channel deposits, which in turn may be reworked b...|$|R

40|$|Caves {{are useful}} in {{landscape}} evolution studies because they often mark the level of previous water tables and, when dated, yield incision rates. Dating caves is problematic, however, because their ages are only constrained by the oldest deposits contained within, which may be far younger than the cave itself. We dated cave deposits in the Sierra Nevada using U–Th dating of speleothems, paleomagnetic dating of fine sediment, and cosmogenic 26 Al/ 10 Be burial dating of coarse sediment. The sampled caves formed sequentially as the water table lowered, providing an important stratigraphic test for the dating methods. Large discrepancies between deposit ages from similar cave levels demonstrate that, even when accurately determined, deposit ages can seriously underestimate the timing of cave development. Drip-type speleothems are most prone to this minimum age bias because they can accumulate long after caves form, and because the U–Th method is limited to ~ 400 ka. Paleomagnetic dating requires correlation with the global reversal chronology, and is hindered {{by a lack of}} continuous stratigraphy. The fine sediment analyzed for paleomagnetism is also highly susceptible to remobilization and deposition in cave passages well above base level. Cosmogenic 26 Al/ 10 Be dates <b>bedload</b> material <b>deposited</b> when caves were at or very near river level, and can date material as old as ~ 5 Ma.

40|$|Turbidity {{currents}} {{in the ocean}} are driven by suspended sediment. Yet results from surveys of the modern sea floor and turbidite outcrops indicate that {{they are capable of}} transporting as <b>bedload</b> and <b>depositing</b> particles as coarse as cobble sizes. While bedload cannot drive turbidity currents, it can strongly influence the nature of the deposits they emplace. This paper reports on the first set of experiments which focus on bedload transport of granular material by density underflows. These underflows include saline density flows, hybrid saline/turbidity currents and a pure turbidity current. The use of dissolved salt is a surrogate for suspended mud which is so fine that it does not settle out readily. Thus, all the currents can be considered to be model turbidity currents. The data cover four bed conditions: plane bed, dunes, upstream-migrating antidunes and downstream-migrating antidunes. The bedload transport relation obtained from the data is very similar to those obtained for open-channel flows and, in fact, is fitted well by an existing relation determined for open-channel flows. In the case of dunes and downstream-migrating antidunes, for which flow separation on the lee sides was observed, form drag falls in a range that is similar to that due to dunes in sand-bed rivers. This form drag can be removed from the total bed shear stress using an existing relation developed for rivers. Once this form drag is subtracted, the bedload data for these cases collapse to follow the same relation as for plane beds and upstream-migrating antidunes, for which no flow separation was observed. A relation for flow resistance developed for open-channel flows agrees well with the data when adapted to density underflows. Comparison of the data with a regime diagram for field-scale sand-bed rivers at bankfull flow and field-scale measurements of turbidity currents at Monterey Submarine Canyon, together with Shields number and densimetric Froude number similarity analyses, provide strong evidence that the experimental relations apply at field scale as well...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Palaeochannels have {{numerous}} {{deleterious effects}} on coal mining including {{the formation of}} 'washouts', and their detection and delineation in the subsurface is of paramount importance. A palaeochannel system in {{the roof of the}} High Hazles Coal (Westphalian B) at Gedling Colliery, Nottinghamshire, is described. The roof strata of this seam are interpreted as the deposits of a lacustrine delta complex formed on an upper delta plain, with the palaeochannels constituting minor deltaic distributaries. The lacustrine delta front deposits consist of a coarsening-upwards sequence of siltstones and sandstones, which form a sheet-like body of coalescing distributary mouth bars that were laid down by friction-dominated effluents. The distributary channels were filled by a variety of processes, giving rise to complex channel <b>deposits.</b> <b>Bedload</b> deposition of sand on bars, collapse and sloughing of channel banks, and deposition of silts and muds from suspension were important mechanisms. The nature of the deposits reflects the mode of channel abandonment, rather than equilibrium channel processes. Overbank flood deposits and prodelta/lacustrine mudstones are also described from the High Hazles roof. Based on this study, criteria are suggested that may enable the successful detection and delineation of palaeochannels in mine workings elsewhere. Palaeochannels are features of many coal-bearing sequences that may have adverse effects on mining. Coal companies world-wide recognize the risks imposed by palaeochannels, and thus take steps to delineate their positions in order to minimize their effects on coal mining (e. g. Clarke 1963...|$|R
40|$|The {{morphological}} {{evolution of}} the entrances and exits of abandoned river channels governs their hydrological connectivity. The study focusses on flow and sediment dynamics in the exit of a cut-off meander where the downstream entrance is still connected to the main channel, but the upstream entrance is closed. Two similar field and laboratory cases were investigated using innovative velocimetry techniques (acoustic Doppler profiling, image analysis). Laboratory experiments were conducted with a mobile-bed physical model of the Morava river (Slovakia). Field measurements were performed in the exit of the Port-Galland cut-off meander, Ain river (France). Both cases yielded consistent and complementary results from which a generic scheme for flow patterns and morphological evolution was derived. A simple analogy with flows in rectangular side cavities was used to explain the recirculating flow patterns which developed in the exit. A decelerating inflow <b>deposits</b> <b>bedload</b> in the downstream part of the cavity, while the upstream part is eroded by an accelerating outflow, leading to the retreat of the upstream bank. In the field, strong secondary currents were observed, especially in the inflow, which may enhance the scouring of the downstream corner of the cavity. Also, fine sediment deposits constituted a silt layer in a transitional zone, located between {{the mouth of the}} abandoned channel and the oxbow-lake within the cut-off meander.

40|$|We {{conducted}} field {{monitoring of}} bedload transport rate associated with experimental sediment release {{in a natural}} channel to clarify behavior of the supplied sediment on mixed size bed. Observation of bedload rate at two sites along the 30 m channel reach revealed that downstream migration of finer particles delay compared with coarser particles. Ratio of the <b>bedload</b> sediment that <b>deposited</b> during the migration was higher for finer sediments. These behaviors of the mixed size particles were clear during passage of the sediment wave without changes in water discharge. Flashing peak of discharge that caused artificially by opening of the dam gate did not destroy channel bed structure including steps and pools formed by coarser sediments, and only small amount of bedload was mobilized. Both reach scale channel features including steps, pools, and riffles as well as fine scale features (i. e., armour coat) likely increased critical shear stress of particles and decreased bedload rate during our experiment. Extreme sediment supply induced two types of sediment deposition; (1) filling the pools in reach sales and (2) the intrusion of fine particles into the coarser sediment that formed an armour layer. The all grain size fractions can deposit as type (1) when shear stress of stream water {{is not enough to}} entrain bedload particles, while deposition type (2) occurs when finer sediment pass over channel bed on which armour coat is well-developed. Deposition of finer sediment into coarser sediment that forms armour coat is affected by grain size distribution of bed surface sediment. Thus, impact of the sediment supply on downstream channel depends on both bedforms and grain size distribution of bed surface sediment over which the supplied sediment pass...|$|R
40|$|Many ancient {{sedimentary}} basins {{are interpreted}} as endorheic basins, internally drained basins with no direct hydrological {{connection to the}} marine environment. Some of these endorheic basins are economically important because of the abundance of hydrocarbon resources. To date, many {{studies have been conducted}} on fluvial systems in endorheic basins; however, the fluvial architecture and facies distribution in ancient fluvial systems are not fully understood. Although they are an important key to rock record interpretation, modern terminal fluvial systems in semi-arid endorheic basins are rarely reported due to difficulties such as poor accessibility. The major objectives of this study are to: (1) investigate the development in space and time of the channel morphology and sediment distribution of a distal fluvial system in a semi-arid climatic setting, and (2) to build a quantitative data set {{for the construction of a}} 3 D sedimentary architecture model. The study is carried out on a river terminus system, the Río Colorado, at the edge of the world’s largest salt lake, the Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia. This unconfined and largely non-vegetated river terminus provides the opportunity to acquire a large data set including field and satellite data that enables analysing the development of channel morphologies and sediment characteristics (e. g., avulsion history, splay morphology and surface dynamics). The data acquisition consists of daily precipitation data, a Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM), a time-series Landsat imagery and high resolution WorldView- 02 and QuickBird- 02 satellite images, as well as surface and shallow sediment samples and high precision GPS data (Chapter 1). Changes in channel morphology of the terminal fluvial system are a function of the precipitation intensity in the catchment area (Chapter 2). The catchment area is characteristic of a mean slope of 0. 0008 m/m with the highest slope near the margin and gradually decreasing slope downstream, as well as higher vegetation cover in the mountainous regions than that in the tributary delta and terminal fluvial fan. Ten peak discharge events with more than 50 m 3 /s have been pinpointed between 1985 and 1999. The peak discharges resulted in massive flood-out of water and sediment onto the floodplain in the very low gradient river terminus and with a cross sectional channel area of less than 80 m 2. The development in space and time of crevasse splays and local avulsions was visualized by comparing Landsat MSS and TM images before and after peak discharge events. Crevasse splays expanded in peak discharge periods, and this led to amalgamation with adjacent crevasse splays by compensational stacking. The areal extent of the crevasse splays did not change in between peak discharge events. Multiple local avulsions were distinguished between 1975 and 2001. Crevasse splays and their crevasse channels can evolve over time to an entirely new river channel. Erosion greatly exceeds accretion on both banks of the river in the tributary catchment. The prominent river bank erosion is associated with an evolving channel planform such as meander morphology, channel morphology and river pattern development (Chapter 3). Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) analysis and field investigations suggest that non-vegetation cover and abundance of desiccation cracks and burrows are the main contributors to bank erosion. Changes in channel planform are the product of continuous lateral migration and frequent overbank flooding. Shallow channels and poor development of levees in combination with in-channel accretionary benches result in frequent overbank flooding, which lead to a high density of crevasse splays over unconsolidated river banks and accretionary benches. Avulsion and chute channels together with reactivation of partially abandoned meanders and connection of headcuts and crevasse channels produce an anabranching pattern in the study area. Crevasse splays have been categorized into three classes based on their development in space and time: new crevasse splays (NCS), changing crevasse splays (CCS) and inactive crevasse splays (ICS) (Chapter 4). The occurrence of these three types of crevasse splays shows no relationship with distance along the stream. The local gradient also shows no correlation with the number of crevasse splays. By contrast, the number of crevasse splay shows an exponential increase as the cross-sectional channel area decreases. In addition, some crevasse splays are attributed to the topographic low between adjacent crevasse splays and fill in the depression by compensational stacking. The unconfined area of the system showed great variations in sediment composition downstream. The alluvial fan segment is characterized by gravel with a fining-upward sequence, whereas the upper coastal plain segment is typified by coarse sand and some fine gravel in the upstream area, grading to fine sand downstream. Silt and clay are the dominant sediments in the lower coastal plain segment, although there is also some very fine sand. It was found that the study area is characterized by a linear decrease downstream in bedload and correspondingly an increase in suspended load deposits (Chapter 5). Thus, in the upper coastal plain <b>bedload</b> <b>deposits</b> dominate, while in the lower coastal plain suspended load deposits are prominent. A spectral library has been established for four types of surface materials using Landsat surface reflectance in combination with Landsat CDR data and field data analysis (Chapter 6). Four types of surface materials are distinguished in the river terminus: A: salty surface; B: silt-rich surface; C, clay-rich surface; D: salt. The silt-rich surface has a weak correlation with the annual precipitation while the salty surface tends to be inversely proportional to the annual precipitation. There is no relationship between the clay-rich surface and the annual precipitation. The main geomorphological changes have been identified as the formation of crevasse splays and avulsions. High annual precipitation-induced avulsions are found to lead to increased silt-rich surfaces. Channel and splay morphodynamics, longitudinal sediment dispersion pattern in the system, and surface composition in the river terminus are the focus of this study. The expected preservation potential and sequence stratigraphy of the Río Colorado system is discussed. Future work on such dryland river systems could include investigations of the mechanisms of fluvial discontinuity at the boundary between alluvial fan and upper coastal plain, the interaction between aeolian dunes and fluvial systems in the Río Colorado river system, and groundwater regimes in the coastal plain (Chapter 7) ...|$|R
