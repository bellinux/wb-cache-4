5|$|Fatty acids {{are made}} by fatty acid synthases that {{polymerize}} and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acyl group, reduce it <b>to</b> <b>an</b> alcohol, dehydrate it <b>to</b> <b>an</b> alkene group and then reduce it again <b>to</b> <b>an</b> alkane group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups: in animals and fungi, all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional type I protein, while in plant plastids and bacteria separate type II enzymes perform each step in the pathway.|$|E
