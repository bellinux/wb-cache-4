Disconnecting may also be necessary, which may involve splitting, cutting and burning work. When welding is necessary a hyperbaric welding chamber may be fitted around the pipeline so that welding {{can be done in}} an inert gaseous environment rather than wet, as this improves the weld quality. Depending on circumstances, the chamber may be large enough for the welder to work inside, but as the chamber must be accessed at depth and is under ambient pressure, the work must be done by a diver.|$|E

To solve these problems, we designed a new on-line sample preparation system. The system consists of an eluting pump, a mixing TEE connector, a 10 -port 2 -position valve and a solid-phase extraction precolumn. The eluate from the precolumn is diluted with a weak solvent from the HPLC at the <b>TEE</b> <b>connection</b> to load low hydrophobic compounds onto the analytical column. The proposed on-line sample preparation system was successfully applied to the simultaneous analysis of 21 pesticides in river water using LC/TOF-MS. In this method, the recoveries from river water samples were 67 to 126 % (mean 83 %), the reproducibility (CV%) was in the range from 1. 1 to 11 % (mean 5. 6 %), the calibration curve was linear in the range from 1 ppb to 500 ppb (r > 0. 999) and the detection limits (S/N = 3) were in the range from 0. 0034 ppb (daimuron) to 3. 3 ppb (oxine-copper). 2006 © The Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a limit analysis, {{based on the}} yield line approach, for predicting the ultimate capacity of welded <b>tee</b> end <b>connections</b> for hollow tubes. Five failure mechanisms are identified. The failure mechanisms range from simple mechanisms such as yielding of the cleat plate or the tube, to the more complex mechanisms involving a combination of hinge formation in the cap plate and local yielding in the tube. It is shown that {{the dimensions of the}} connection components involving the tube, the cap, and the cleat plate sizes determine which is the controlling failure mechanism. Results presented are applicable to welded <b>tee</b> end <b>connections</b> for hollow tubes of both circular and rectangular sections. A previous series of tests on this type of end connection was conducted on tubes of end connection was conducted on tubes of circular hollow section. In this paper, a further series of tests on tubes of square hollow section is presented. The theoretical predictions, based on the yield line approach, agree very well with test results from 36 welded <b>tee</b> end <b>connections</b> on circular and square hollow tubes...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this work was to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of using advanced composite materials to enhance double tee to double <b>tee</b> <b>connections</b> in regions of significant seismic and lateral load. This work stems partly from the unfortunate losses experienced during the 1994 Northridge California earthquake. Moreover, this work was also developed from discussions with a local precasting company, which is concerned about premature failure of the connection due to stress concentrations. The author contends that the current connection method, intermittent welded plates, does result in stress concentrations, which can effect the system 2 ̆ 7 s overall performance. The proposed connection was formed by using a grouting material in conjunction with CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer) fabrics, placed at +/- 45 ° from the axis of the joint under consideration. It is believed that this connection will not only enhance the system 2 ̆ 7 s diaphragm action and reduce stress concentrations in the connectors currently used, but it will also enhance the system 2 ̆ 7 s load distribution mechanisms. At the University of Windsor a special set of experiments were conducted in the Civil Engineering Structures laboratory. These experiments were conducted at a 1 : 4 scale based on reviewed, full scale plans from a local precasting company. These experiments involved testing of two connected double <b>tees</b> with various <b>connection</b> designs. The tests conducted included dynamic analysis and ultimate loading. The experimental work was verified using a Finite Element Model. Overall, the proposed composite connection performed well and has proven itself suitable for repair and new construction works. It should be noted that this connection 2 ̆ 7 s performance is only known for the short term, thus long term effects are not yet know.

40|$|Design and {{analytical}} modeling considerations associated with recirculating flow in piping systems with tee and Y connections are presented. Flow recirculation, in many process piping networks, can produce nonsteady flow and associated thermal conditions. In the flow recirculation discussion, experimental data is presented for a 90 degree branch piping (<b>tee</b> <b>connection)</b> using four different branch pipe sizes {{over a wide}} velocity range [Coffield and Kolar (1990) ]. The discussion also includes recent test data for a 45 degree, Y connected, branch piping design. Designers can use this information by directly applying the limiting conditions that are presented at the design stage, or in evaluating the performance of existing systems. For example, although flow recirculation may result in complicated flow patterns, it often can have the beneficial effect of mixing low velocity branch line fluid with the primary system fluid as it approaches the intersection. In branch pipe systems where flows are at different temperatures this recirculation helps attenuate the potential for large thermal stresses. The recirculation flow patterns are strongly affected by the branch angle and thus they are presented {{as a function of}} the branch angle...|$|E
40|$|Thermal fatigue is a {{significant}} long-term degradation mechanism in nuclear power plants. In particular, as operating plants become older and life time extension activities are initiated, operators and regulators need screening criteria to exclude risks of thermal fatigue and methods to determine significant fatigue relevance. In general, the common thermal fatigue issues are well understood and controlled by plant instrumentation at fatigue susceptible locations. However, incidents indicate that certain piping system <b>Tee</b> <b>connections</b> are susceptible to turbulent temperature mixing effects that cannot be adequately monitored by common thermocouple instrumentations. Therefore, in this study thermal fatigue evaluation of piping system Tee-connections is performed using the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analysis. From the thermal hydraulic analysis, the temperature distributions are determined and their results are applied to the structural model of the piping system to determine the thermal stress. Using the rain-flow method the fatigue analysis is performed to generate fatigue usage factors. The procedure for improved load thermal fatigue assessment using FSI analysis shown in this study will supply valuable information for establishing a methodology on thermal fatigue...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Elements {{of water}} supply {{systems such as}} pipes, elbows, <b>tee</b> <b>connections,</b> …etc., are made of {{polymeric}} materials. They are sub-jected to erosion by streams of water and contaminants. The objective of this work is to investigate the erosion resistance of the polymers that are locally used to produce such components. Three materials were examined, namely: High pressure PVC (HP-PVC), Low pressure PVC (LP-PVC), and Polypropylene (PP). Four types of water were used to erode the polymeric specimens: Distilled water (DiW), De-salinated water (DeW), Sea water (SW), and untreated deep ground (Well) water (WW). The effects of water stream velocity and eroding time on the erosion wear behaviour of the polymers were examined. The work was conducted under controlled environment of 23 °C tem-perature and 40 % humidity. Results show that erosive wear of all ma-terials increases {{with the increase in}} stream velocity and/or eroding time. It also indicates that at certain values of velocity and/or eroding time the increase in rate was more pronounced. In addition the pres-ence of water contaminants has drastic effects on the erosion volume. Results also show that HP-PVC has the highest erosion resistance...|$|R
40|$|Dealing {{with the}} seismic {{behavior}} of steel MRFs, in last decade, {{the adoption of}} dissipative partialstrength beam-to-column joints has started to be considered an effective alternative to the traditional design approach which, aiming to dissipate the seismic input energy at beam ends, suggests the use of full-strength joints. On the base of past experimental results, the use of dissipative Double Split <b>Tee</b> (DST) <b>connections</b> {{can be considered a}} promising solution from the technological standpoint, because they can be easily replaced after the occurrence of a seismic event. Nevertheless, their dissipation supply under cyclic loads has been demonstrated to be characterized by significant pinching and strength degradation which undermine the energy dissipation capacity. The need to overcome these drawbacks to gain competitive technological solutions has suggested an innovative approach based on the integration of beam-to-column joints by means of friction dampers located at the beam flange level. Therefore, the use of partial strength DST joints equipped with friction pads is proposed. Aiming to the assessment of the cyclic rotational response of such innovative connections, two experimental programs have been undertaken. The first one has been aimed at characterizing the dissipative performances of five frictional interfaces to be employed as dampers. The second one is aimed at the application of the same materials to DST joints specifically designed for dissipating the seismic input energy in a couple of friction dampers located at the beam flanges level. The results of the experimental analysis carried out at the Materials and Structures Laboratory of Salerno University are herein presented, showing the potential of the proposed damage-free beam-to-column joints...|$|R
