5|$|The porters {{abandon the}} group in fear when mysterious tracks are found, while Tintin, Haddock and Tharkey go on and {{eventually}} reach the crash site. Tintin sets off with Snowy to trace Chang's steps, and finds a cave where Chang has carved his name on a rock. On leaving the cave, he encounters a snowstorm and glimpses what seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> silhouette. Tharkey believes that Tintin saw the Yeti and convinces him to abandon his friend and return with him to Nepal, since the area is too large to search. Tintin spots a scarf on a cliff face, concludes Chang is nearby, and continues with only the Captain. While attempting to scale a cliff face, Haddock slips and hangs out of reach, imperilling Tintin, who is tied to him. He tells Tintin to cut the rope to save himself, but Tintin refuses. Haddock tries to cut it himself, but drops his knife, alerting Tharkey, who has returned in time to rescue them. They try to camp for the night but lose their tent and must trek onwards, unable to sleep lest they freeze, arriving {{within sight of the}} Buddhist monastery of Khor-Biyong before being caught in an avalanche.|$|E

25|$|Augustine was not preoccupied, as Plato and Descartes were, with {{going too}} much into details in efforts to explain the metaphysics of the soul-body union. It sufficed for him {{to admit that they}} are metaphysically distinct: <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> is to be a {{composite}} of soul and body, and the soul is superior to the body. The latter statement is grounded in his hierarchical classification of things into those that merely exist, those that exist and live, and those that exist, live, and have intelligence or reason.|$|E

25|$|While {{investigating}} another victim, Fronsac finds a fang made of steel, {{which increases}} his doubts of the beast's existence. A traumatised child witness swears that the beast {{is controlled by}} what seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> master. Fronsac studies the patterns of the attacks and victims, {{trying to find a}} common thread and reveal the murderer. As the investigation proves to be unfruitful, the king's weapons master, Lord de Beauterne, arrives {{to put an end to}} the beast. However, instead of doing so, Beauterne kills an ordinary wolf and tells Fronsac to alter the corpse so it resembles the monster. Fronsac hesitantly does so, and the bogus wolf is sent back to Paris, where it is put on display, much to the pleasure of the king and the French aristocracy.|$|E
25|$|There {{have also}} been {{multiple}} international groups that have issued reports addressing issues in special education. The United Nations on “International Norms and Standards relating to Disability” in 1998. This report cites multiple conventions, statements, declarations, and other reports such as: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, The Salamanca Statement, the Sundberg Declaration, the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action, and many others. One main point that the report emphasizes is the necessity for education <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> right. The report also states that the “quality of education should be {{equal to that of}} persons without disabilities.” The other main points brought up by the report discuss integrated education, special education classes as supplementary, teacher training, and equality for vocational education. The United Nations also releases a report by the Special Rapporteur that has a focus on persons with disabilities. In 2015, a report titled “Report of the Special Rapporteur to the 52nd Session of the Commission for Social Development: Note by the Secretary-General on Monitoring of the implementation of the Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities” was released. This report focused on looking at how the many countries involved, with a focus on Africa, have handled policy regarding persons with disabilities. In this discussion, the author also focuses on the importance of education for persons with disabilities as well as policies that could help improve the education system such as a move towards a more inclusive approach. The World Health Organization has also published a report addressing people with disabilities and within this there is a discussion on education in their “World Report on Disability” in 201. Other organizations that have issued reports discussing the topic are UNESCO, UNICEF, and the World Bank.|$|E

500|$|The Hustler is {{fundamentally}} {{a story of}} what it means <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> being, couched within the context of winning and losing. Describing the film, Robert Rossen said: [...] "My protagonist, Fast Eddie, wants to become a great pool player, but the film is really about the obstacles he encounters in attempting to fulfill himself as a human being. He attains self-awareness only after a terrible personal tragedy which he has caused— and then he wins his pool game." [...] Roger Ebert concurs with this assessment, citing The Hustler as [...] "one of the few American movies in which the hero wins by surrendering, by accepting reality instead of his dreams." ...|$|E

500|$|At the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, LaBeouf {{told the}} Los Angeles Times he had [...] "dropped {{the ball on}} the legacy that people loved and cherished" [...] and felt that [...] "the movie could have been updated ... we just misinterpreted {{what we were trying to}} satiate." [...] In 2011, in {{response}} to LaBeouf's comments, Harrison Ford said: [...] "I think I told [...] he was a fucking idiot ... As an actor, I think it's my obligation to support the film without making a complete ass of myself. Shia is ambitious, attentive and talented — and he's learning how to deal with a situation which is very unique and difficult." [...] LaBeouf later regretted his comments and their effect on his relationship with Spielberg: [...] "He told me there's a time <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> being and have an opinion, and there's a time to sell cars. It brought me freedom, but it also killed my spirits because this was a dude I looked up to like a sensei." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{year later}} a further {{discovery}} {{was made at}} Lindow Moss, just [...] south-west of the Lindow Woman. On 1 August 1984, Andy Mould, who {{had been involved in}} the discovery of Lindow Woman, took {{what he thought was a}} piece of wood off the elevator of the peat-shredding machine. He threw the object at Eddie Slack, his workmate. When it hit the ground, peat fell off the object and revealed it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> foot. The police were called and the foot was taken away for examination. Rick Turner, the Cheshire County Archaeologist, was notified of the discovery and succeeded in finding the rest of the body, which later became known as Lindow Man. Some skin had been exposed and had started to decay, so to prevent further deterioration of the body, it was re-covered with peat. The complete excavation of the block containing the remains was performed on 6 August. Until it could be dated, it was moved to the Macclesfield District General Hospital for storage. As the body of Malika Reyn-Bardt had still not been found, it was thought possible the body might be hers, until it was determined to be male, and radiocarbon dated. The owners of the land on which Lindow Man was found donated the body to the British Museum, and on 21 August it was transported to London.|$|E
500|$|Some critics {{called it}} {{inappropriate}} {{for the first}} lady to {{play a central role}} in matters of public policy. Supporters pointed out that Clinton's role in policy was no different from that of other White House advisors and that voters had been well aware that she would play an active role in her husband's presidency. Bill Clinton's campaign promise of [...] "two for the price of one" [...] led opponents to refer derisively to the Clintons as [...] "co-presidents" [...] or sometimes use the Arkansas label [...] "Billary". The pressures of conflicting ideas about the role of a first lady were enough to send Hillary Clinton into [...] "imaginary discussions" [...] with the also-politically-active Eleanor Roosevelt. From the time she came to Washington, Hillary also found refuge in a prayer group of the Fellowship that featured many wives of conservative Washington figures. Triggered in part by the death of her father in April 1993, she publicly sought to find a synthesis of Methodist teachings, liberal religious political philosophy and Tikkun editor Michael Lerner's [...] "politics of meaning" [...] to overcome what she saw as America's [...] "sleeping sickness of the soul"; that would lead to a willingness [...] "to remold society by redefining what it means <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> being in the twentieth century, moving into a new millennium." ...|$|E
