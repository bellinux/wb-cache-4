The woollen sector in particular showed strong continuity with the past in its business structures and institutional framework, and this helped to get communities to push for change rather than fighting it. Moreover, West Yorkshire had an extremely complex economy which, in conjunction with an open and varied social structure, created the ideal landscape for evolutionary processes to work themselves out. It is also argued that this complexity allowed the links between clothiers and merchants to act as information processing systems analogous to neural networks, and that they were capable of generating apparently intelligent strategic action at the system level without requiring central control or deliberate co-ordination. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{the last}} few years, the smart <b>textile</b> <b>area</b> has become {{increasingly}} widespread, leading to developments in new wearable sensing systems. Truly wearable instrumented garments capable of recording behavioral and vital signals are crucial for several fields of application. Here we report on results of a careful char- acterization {{of the performance of}} innovative fabric sensors and electrodes able to acquire vital biomechanical and physiological signals, respectively. The sensing function of the fabric sensors re- lies upon newly developed strain sensors, based on rubber-carbon- coated threads, and mainly depends on the weaving topology, and the composition and deposition process of the conducting rubber- carbon mixture. Fabric sensors are used to acquire the respitrace (RT) and movement sensors (MS). Sensing features of electrodes, instead rely upon metal-based conductive threads, which are in- strumental in detecting bioelectrical signals, such as electrocar- diogram (ECG) and electromyogram (EMG). Fabric sensors have been tested during some specific tasks of breathing and movement activity, and results have been compared with the responses of a commercial piezoelectric sensor and an electrogoniometer, respec- tively. The performance of fabric electrodes has been investigated and compared with standard clinical electrodes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMaterials {{nowadays}} become {{smarter and}} “more intelligent”, containing novel functionalities or sensory components. In {{all areas of}} materials science, integrating new abilities into common materials belongs to the most important topics in research and development. In the <b>textile</b> <b>area,</b> several functions {{can be achieved by}} finishing techniques, i. e. physical and/or chemical modifications of textile surfaces. The integration of electronic components, however, still suffers from incompatibilities between soft, flexible, bendable textile fabrics and rigid electronic parts. Connecting conductive yarns with electronic components, such as SMD-LEDs etc., cannot be performed by soldering nor by sewing. The typical connection technologies of both areas fail in these cases. A new possibility to achieve such electrical {{and at the same time}} mechanical connections is given by 3 D printing. In a recent project, we have studied chances and limitations of electric circuits combining textile fabrics with 3 D printing. Textile fabrics were woven and knitted from common yarns as well as wires, strands and different conductive yarns. 3 D printing was used to connect SMD elements and other small electronic parts with these base circuits and compared with soldered and sewn contacts. The influence of conductive wires, yarns or filaments integrated in the printed elements was tested. The article will give an overview of possibilities and problems in electrical contacting of small electronic components on partly conductive textile fabrics by conductive 3 D printed connections. Additionally, an outlook to other potential areas of application, such as sensors and actuators on textile fabrics, is presented...|$|E

Actually, one stays around 80 % of a day in closed areas. The photocatalytic process is now recognized as an efficient method to remove organic pollutants present in gaseous phase. However, {{there are still some}} drawbacks with current reactors as for example lightutilization limitations due to absorption and/or scattering by the reaction medium or as restricted processing capacities due to mass transport limitations. The solution proposed in this work lies in the use of a lighted textile with optical fibers. The polymer optical fibers are treated to allow a radial leak of light through several dotted lights, allowing the carrying and the supply of UV light onto the overall <b>textile</b> <b>area.</b> Once coated using a suspension of TiO 2, the textile becomes a photocatalytic materials for which UV light is carried into the bulk of the photocatalytic bed. The modifications of the fibers surface have been characterized by ESEM. The topology was characterized by optical microscopy and the radiant flux was measured by radiometry. The characteristics of the coating such as the photocatalyst content, its location and its adherence have been studied to understand the coating properties. The photocatalytic efficiency of samples coated with TiO 2 was measured using formaldehyde as model molecule. The results obtained with a such new textile are very encouraging because this innovation allows to imagine a three dimensional light sources irradiate photocatalytic bed either its surface than its bulk. New perspectives in photocatalytic process are so opened. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
