5|$|Australian ravens are {{intelligent}} birds, {{and like}} many other corvids have innovative methods of seeking out food. Foraging {{takes place in the}} early morning or late afternoon; birds rest in the hotter part of the day. Food is taken mainly from the ground, birds either finding objects while flying overhead, or by walking along and looking. However, they occasionally feed in trees—Australian ravens forage eucalypt foliage for Christmas beetles (Anoplognathus), and devote a substantial amount of <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for nests and eggs to eat. They have also been known to take golf balls from fairways, possibly mistaking them for eggs. Ravens use their bill rather than their feet to explore or turn items on the ground (rocks or sticks) over, or hold or snatch food while flying. They have also been recorded using fence posts as anvils to bash snails against before eating them. Australian ravens most often eat food where they find it unless taking food back for nestlings. Occasionally they have been observed caching carrion or a killed animal in a hole nearby to store it. They can pack shredded meat in their mouth under their tongue. Australian ravens have adapted well to eating food scraps in urban areas, such as school playgrounds, rubbish tips, bins outside supermarkets or restaurants, abattoirs, piggeries and farmyards. In one isolated study, they were observed feeding on nectar from eucalypt flowers. Australian ravens sometimes forage in mixed-species flocks with any of the other four species of Australian corvids. Sometimes they are aggressive with little ravens if both are at a food source and drive them off, though not if the smaller species greatly outnumbers the larger.|$|E

500|$|However, {{not all the}} sixth-season episodes were poorly received. The season's third episode, [...] "Triangle" [...] {{was largely}} lauded as a {{masterpiece}} by critics. The episode, which was shot in real <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like it was filmed in four uninterrupted eleven-minute takes, was called a [...] "classic" [...] standalone episode {{and one of the}} [...] "highlights of season six". The [...] "Two Fathers"/"One Son" [...] story-arc, which featured the destruction of the Syndicate, was called one [...] "of the most coherent, [...] almost unbearably tense, hours in the series' run" [...] by one critic. Finally, the Duchovny-penned [...] "The Unnatural", which featured the story of an alien who fell in love with baseball, was praised by critics for its plot, directing, and originality.

[...] His insistent demands alerted the customs officials, who notified the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau, which took a keen interest in new developments in radio technology. [...] And since it happened to be a Saturday afternoon, the Bureau's experts had ample <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> into the matter. [...] They carefully opened the box and found that it did not, in fact, contain radio equipment but a cipher machine. [...] They examined the machine minutely, then put it back into the box.|$|E

500|$|After {{negotiations}} {{with both the}} Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New York Jets, the Packers traded Favre to the Jets on August 7, 2008, {{in exchange for a}} conditional fourth-round pick in the 2009 NFL Draft with performance escalation. Favre's season with the Jets started well; in Week 4 of the 2008 season, he threw six touchdowns against the Arizona Cardinals, a personal best and one shy of the NFL record. This performance led to him being selected as the FedEx Air Player of the Week. By Week 12, the Jets had compiled an 8–3 record, including a win over the previously undefeated Tennessee Titans. However, the Jets lost four of the last five games of the season, including the final game against AFC East divisional opponent Miami, who had acquired quarterback Chad Pennington after he was released from the Jets to make room for Favre. In those five games, Favre threw eight interceptions and only two touchdown passes, bringing his season total to twenty-two of each. Favre had complained of shoulder pain and had an MRI performed on December 29, 2008, which revealed a torn biceps tendon in his right shoulder. After the 2008 season had ended, in mid January 2009, Favre told Jets General Manager Mike Tannenbaum, [...] "it may be <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> in a different direction" [...] regarding the quarterback position. On February 11, 2009, Favre informed the Jets that he was retiring after 18 seasons. He remained part of the New York Jets organization, until April 28, 2009, when the Jets released Favre from his contract, thus allowing him to sign anywhere he wanted. By May 2009, he was officially cut from the Jets Reserve/Retired list. In September 2009, Favre again made Jets news, as the NFL learned that the Jets were aware that Favre injured his arm in the eleventh game of the 2008 season, and fined the Jets $125,000 for not reporting the injury in any of the Jets' five final games.|$|E

2500|$|One Australian {{commentator}} {{noted that}} the reform of the administrative machinery of the church, the Roman Curia, was a major issue, as there was no major progressive candidate, and indeed no clear front-runners, in the dynamic between institutional-maintenance and evangelical Catholicism. Giacomo Galeazzi of La Stampa said that [...] "Apparently a sort of tsunami of non-European candidates will fall upon the Roman Curia, and this could take the pontificate far away from Rome, making it more international."

[...] "This was, of course, utterly wrong and demoralizing, but Mr. Webster came, after a <b>time,</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> upon such transactions as natural and proper.

2500|$|Inspiration for the song's lyrics came via the Internet {{generation}} and group members Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope raising children. In response to both modern jadedness {{and their children}} experiencing wonders {{of the world for}} the first time, the group wanted to write a song about natural phenomena humans experience in life which often go unacknowledged. The closing lyrics encourage listeners to take <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the world and [...] "appreciate the things that life has to offer". According to Violent J, [...] "What's a shame is how people walk around blind to it all. They lost their spirit about everything. If you can’t even see the miracle in animals, then you must have never truly loved a pet." [...] He believes that scientific explanations can sometimes kill the intriguing mysteries of the world, such as how ancient pyramids were made. Violent J admits that the song's lyrics discuss [...] "things [...] may not be actual miracles. They may have scientific facts explaining them [...] But nonetheless, these things are still incredible [...] and they should be appreciated." [...] He added that the group's use of the word 'miracle' was intended to mean [...] "something fuckin’ amazing and incredible, [...] special, awesome event, [...] a great, wonderful thing." ...|$|E
