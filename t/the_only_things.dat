5|$|Back at Kiamo Ko, Elphaba {{has already}} {{captured}} Dorothy, refusing to release {{her until she}} relinquishes Nessarose's slippers – <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>things</b> left of her dead sister. Glinda travels to Elphaba's castle to warn her of the danger and persuade her to let Dorothy go. Elphaba refuses until she suddenly receives a letter saying that Fiyero has died. The two women forgive each other for all grievances, acknowledging they have both made mistakes. To help her in her future, Elphaba gives the Grimmerie to Glinda. The two friends embrace {{for the last time}} before saying goodbye forever, and acknowledge that they are who they are because of each other ("For Good"). As the mob arrives at the castle, Elphaba tells Glinda to hide, and she watches from the shadows as Dorothy throws a bucket of water on Elphaba, who appears to melt away. Grief-stricken, Glinda sees that all that remains of her friend is her black hat and the small bottle of green elixir which she had slept with under her pillow.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s and 1940s, {{the plans}} were revised, with new plans {{such as a}} line to Staten Island and a revised line to the Rockaways. In the late 1940s and 1950s, a Queens Bypass line via the Long Island Rail Road's Main Line was first {{proposed}} as {{a branch of the}} still-planned Second Avenue Subway. In addition, capacity on existing lines would have been improved through the construction of strategic connections such as the Culver Ramp, the 60th Street Tunnel Connection, and the Chrystie Street Connection, and through the rebuilding of DeKalb Avenue Junction. These improvements were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>things</b> to come out of these plans. Eventually, these plans were modified to what became the Program for Action, which was put forth by the New York City Transit Authority in 1968. This was the last plan for a major expansion of the subway system. The plan included the construction of the Second Avenue Subway, a Queens Bypass line, a line replacing the Third Avenue El in the Bronx, and other extensions in the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn. While ambitious, very little of the plan was completed, mostly because of the financial crisis during the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Still incognito, the Commander {{traveled}} to Denver where he {{sought out the}} undercover Crimson Guard agent Fred VII, a mechanical genius. Billy eventually awoke from the coma, with acute amnesia (and a new motorized prosthetic leg built by Fred). After an encounter with the Blind Master and Storm Shadow's cousin Jinx, Billy recovered his memory and immediately rejected his father, whereupon the Commander renounced the organization he had founded, declaring that his ambitions had cost him <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>things</b> that truly mattered. Fred VII, in return, shot Cobra Commander in the back, apparently killing him.|$|E

25|$|Fifty years later, Doro {{returns to}} the seed village. His {{relationship}} with Anyanwu has deteriorated, and one of <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>things</b> keeping him from killing her is her successful marriage to Isaac. He has come home because he senses that Anyanwu’s daughter, Nweke, is fully coming into her powers. During her transition, Nweke attacks Anyanwu. Trying to protect Anyanwu, Isaac accidentally kills Nweke and suffers a heart attack. Anyanwu realizes she is too weak to heal Isaac and he dies. Afraid that Doro will kill her now that Isaac is not there to protect her, Anyanwu transforms into an animal and runs away.|$|E
25|$|After the battle, minor {{actions were}} {{fought in the}} fortifications {{surrounding}} Bucharest between the invading Germans and the Romanian reserves which had failed to arrive and {{the remnants of the}} defenders of the Sereth–Putna line, yet it was occupied by the Germans on 6 December 1916, which was the same day that southern Romania capitulated, as the monarchy had fled to Iași. Heavy rain and terrible roads were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>things</b> that saved the remainder of the Romanian Army, which began to withdraw towards the Siret River and Russia, where the campaign drew to a close in January 1917. Romanian losses during the battle on the Argeș and the fighting that preceded it were very high, with about 300,000 being lost, around 150,000 of which were captured. In this same period, the Germans had suffered about 60,000 casualties.|$|E
25|$|Soon, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>things</b> keeping most {{passenger}} trains running were legal obligations. Meanwhile, companies who {{were interested in}} using railroads for profitable freight traffic were looking for ways to get out of those legal obligations, and it looked like intercity passenger rail service would soon become extinct in the United States beyond a few highly populated corridors. The final blow for {{passenger trains}} in the U.S. came with the loss of railroad post offices in the 1960s. On May 1, 1971, the federally funded Amtrak took over (with a few exceptions) all intercity passenger rail service in the continental United States. The Rio Grande, with its Denver-Ogden Rio Grande Zephyr and the Southern with its Washington, D.C.–New Orleans Southern Crescent chose to stay out of Amtrak, and the Rock Island, with two intrastate Illinois trains, was too far gone to be included into Amtrak.|$|E

500|$|Nation of Ulysses' {{music was}} noisy and manic, {{but they also}} had a strong free-jazz influence. The group {{embodied}} {{a rejection of the}} 1960s and 1970s music and styling by rejecting drug use and advocating that punk youth dress nicely and sensibly. To this end, the liner notes of 13-Point Program to Destroy America states the band's aim [...] "To dress well, as clothing and fashion, are <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>things</b> which we -- the kids -- being utterly disenfranchised, have any control over." [...] Much of the band admitted to not knowing how to play their instruments well, stating [...] "All you need is a concept. There's no reason you have to sound like Led Zeppelin." ...|$|E
500|$|Fegelein's {{politically}} motivated marriage to Gretl Braun, Eva Braun's sister, {{took place on}} 3 June 1944 in Salzburg. Historians Kershaw and Shirer believe he courted Braun {{as a way to}} advance his career. Hitler, Himmler and Martin Bormann acted as witnesses at the ceremony. A two-day celebration was then held at Hitler's and Bormann's Obersalzberg mountain homes and the Eagle's Nest. Fegelein was a known playboy and had many extramarital affairs. Hitler's secretaries, Christa Schroeder and Traudl Junge, state Fegelein was popular socially, particularly with women. He could be funny, amusing and charming. After his marriage to Gretl, Eva was glad to have someone in the entourage with whom she could dance and flirt, as Hitler was distant in social situations and refrained from publicly showing affection. Thereafter, Fegelein worked hard to develop a friendship with Hitler's powerful private secretary, Martin Bormann. Fegelein [...] "never missed" [...] Bormann's drinking parties and told Junge that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>things</b> that mattered were [...] "his career and a life full of fun." ...|$|E
500|$|In the B story, Andy (Chris Pratt) still pines for April (Aubrey Plaza), {{who remains}} angry at Andy {{and is now}} dating the {{handsome}} Eduardo (Carlo Mendez). Chris (Rob Lowe) suggests Andy tap into the aspects of his personality April was attracted to in the first place. However, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>things</b> he can think of are that he is nice and {{he is in a}} band. Andy decides to be nice to Eduardo, and the two realize they have similar musical tastes (they both like the Dave Matthews Band) and end up bonding over a guitar session. April becomes frustrated because she only dated Eduardo to make Andy jealous. She dumps Eduardo, which Chris interprets as a sign that his efforts are succeeding. Ann (Rashida Jones), who was nervous about Andy and Chris spending time together, is relieved when Chris tells her that Andy had nothing but positive things to say about her. The episode ends with the Pawnee residents [...] including Kelly and his daughter [...] watching an outdoor screening of the Twilight film.|$|E

500|$|With Ralph Korngold's 1955 {{biography}} of Stevens, the neoabolitionist school of historians began {{to consider the}} former congressman. These professors rejected the earlier view that those who had gone South to aid the African-American after the war were [...] "rapscallion carpetbaggers" [...] defeated by [...] "saintly redeemers.” [...] Instead, they applauded those who had sought to end slavery and forward civil rights, and castigated Johnson for obstructionism. [...] They took {{the view that the}} African-American was central to Reconstruction, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>things</b> wrong with the congressional program were that it did not go far enough and that it stopped too soon. [...] Brodie's 1959 {{biography of}} Stevens was of this school. [...] Controversial in its conclusions for being a psychobiography, it found that Stevens was a [...] "consummate underdog who identified with the oppressed” and whose intelligence won him success, while his consciousness of his clubfoot retarded his social development. According to Brodie, this also made him unwilling to marry a woman of his own social standing.|$|E
500|$|MTV {{columnist}} Josh Wigler {{was disappointed}} with the presumed alien storyline and believed {{it to be a}} [...] "weak episode". Despite liking actor Lance Reddick, Wigler was displeased with his character's increased screentime, believing Broyles works better as an [...] "enigmatic figure". Wigler did however praise the villain's [...] "murderous method of choice", writing [...] "Those who've read my Fringe reviews know that I'm not big on the mystery-of-the-week element, but I have to give this episode some credit for at least making it look good." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 8.0/10, noting the [...] "great work" [...] done with the CGI and props {{while at the same time}} acknowledging the opening was not [...] "particularly exciting". Isler praised Reddick's performance, but continued [...] "besides the Broyles characterization, this episode kind of fell flat. The plot unfolds slowly, and the first sixty percent of this episode is kind of a yawner. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>things</b> that really spice up the story are Walter's antics (which are very amusing, as usual). The monster of the week, an alien stowing away in a Russian cosmonaut's body, isn't all that scary or even malevolent (it's just trying to stay alive by feeding on radiation)." ...|$|E

He continued to write that the former [...] "could very well be the disc’s highlight", but felt that Carey sounded like an unknown popstar. However, Jayanthi Daniels of The New York Sun was critical of [...] "I'm That Chick" [...] as well as [...] "Side Effects", describing them as [...] "throwaway pop tracks" [...] on a hip-hop album.
