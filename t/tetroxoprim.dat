40|$|Isostructural solvates of the 1 : 1 {{molecular}} complex between the antibacterial drugs <b>tetroxoprim</b> (TXP) and sulfametrole (SMTR) with formulae TXP. SMTR. CH 3 OH (I), TXP. SMTR. C 2 H 5 OH (II) and TXP. SMTR. H 2 O (III), were investigated {{to establish their}} propensity for guest exchange. Separate exposure of powdered (I), (II) and (III) to a saturated atmosphere of each solvent of the complementary solvate pair at ambient temperature resulted in reversible solvent exchange in all cases. DSC and TG were the methods of choice for monitoring the exchange processes since (I) -(III) have distinct onset temperatures of desolvation and characteristic mass losses. Interpretation of the results {{in terms of the}} known locations of the solvent molecules in crystals of (I) -(III) led to the conclusion that solvent exchange probably proceeds by a co-operative mechanism involving material transport through channels while the common host framework is maintained...|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} Ro 11 - 8958, {{an analog}} of trimethoprim (TMP) with improved antimicrobial and pharmacokinetic properties, other dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitors, sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and dapsone (DAP) {{in the treatment}} of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in an immunosuppressed rat model. In contrast to previous reports, high dosages of the DHFR inhibitors were used in combination with fixed, low dosages of SMX (3 mg/kg of body weight per day) or DAP (25 mg/kg/day). When administered alone at these dosages, SMX and DAP reduced the median P. carinii cyst count about 5 - to 15 -fold. Ro 11 - 8958, TMP, and diaveridine used at a dosage of 20 mg/kg/day with SMX were only slightly more effective than SMX used alone. However, administration of these DHFR inhibitors at a dosage of 100 mg/kg/day with SMX lowered the cyst count about 500 - to 1, 000 -fold, indicating a synergistic effect. Little or no synergism was found when other DHFR inhibitors (pyrimethamine, cycloguanil, and <b>tetroxoprim)</b> were combined with SMX. Regimens of Ro 11 - 8958 at a dosage of 20 mg/kg/day with DAP and of TMP or diaveridine used at a dosage of 100 mg/kg/day with DAP showed comparable anti-P. carinii activity, lowering the cyst count 100 - to 200 -fold. By contrast, Ro 11 - 8958 administered at a dosage of 100 mg/kg/day with DAP reduced the cyst count > 1, 000 -fold. Thus, the experimental approach used here enables the rat model of pneumocystosis to be used to compare synergistic combinations of antifolate drugs. The favorable results achieved with Ro 11 - 8958 indicate that it should be considered for clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>tetroxoprim</b> (TXP) and sulphadiazine (SDZ) {{were studied}} in healthy volunteers. In a single dose study TXP and SDZ were given alone and in combination. No interaction could be detected {{as a result}} of combined administration. The data was fitted for both drugs by computer analysis to a one-compartment model. After a dose of 80 mg orally. TXP was observed to have a mean plasma half-life of 5 · 1 h. The mean peak concentration was 1 · 7 mg/ 1 at 2 · 5 h. The half-life of renal excretion of unchanged TXP was 6 · 7 h, with a recovery of 40 to 60 %. Urine concentrations ranged 30 to 70 mg/ 1 in the first 4 h after the dose. The mean plasma half-life of SDZ was 12 · 6 h, with a mean peak concentration of 16 mg/ 1 at 3 · 5 h. Urinary recovery ofunchanged SDZ was 65 to 70 % of the dose, giving concentrations of 100 to 200 mg/ 1. Total recovery of unchanged plus metabolised drug was 94 to 102 %. After repeated doses of TXP 160 mg 12 -hourly, a steady-state was reached in 24 h giving peak concentration! ' of 4 · 4 mg/ 1 and nadir concentrations of 1 · 2 mg/ 1. The steady-state for SDZ was reached after 48 h of dosing at 400 mg 12 -hourly orally, the concentrations being about twice as great as those following initial doses. The plasma half-lives for SDZ did not alter significantly between the fJrSt and 4 th days of dosing. A study was conducted to ensure that TXP had no inducing effect on human metabolism. No changes in plasma antipyrene half-life, urinary D-glucaric acid excretion, or TXP plasma half-life were detected during eight days ' dosing with TXP 80 mg 12 -hourly. The bioavailabilities ofTXP and SDZ from tablet and syrup formulations were compared. They appeared to be identical for TXP; neither were there differences with SDZ between the formulations, apart from a slightly lower mean peak plasma concentration with the syrup. Although this reached the level of statistical significance, it was felt that further studies were needed before any conclusion could be drawn...|$|E
