5|$|During the referendum, 84% of the {{approximately}} 7.5 million voters approved the amendments. On November 28 of that year, President Lukashenko signed the changes into law. Other results {{not directly related to}} the voting included the expanding role of the Council of Ministers, which allowed it to deal with issues related to development of economic, social and political spheres within Belarus. The 1996 referendum was not, however, the first call <b>to</b> <b>dissolve</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Soviet. In 1991 and 1992, after the August coup in Moscow by senior CPSU officials, democratic forces in the government wanted <b>to</b> <b>dissolve</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Soviet permanently. The members of the Belarusian Popular Front pressed for a referendum, and despite achieving the number of signatures required by law at the time, the Supreme Soviet quashed the measure.|$|E

5|$|In 1953, in {{the face}} of African opposition, Britain {{consolidated}} the two Rhodesias with Nyasaland (Malawi) in the ill-fated Central African Federation, which was essentially dominated by Southern Rhodesia. Growing African nationalism and general dissent, particularly in Nyasaland, persuaded Britain <b>to</b> <b>dissolve</b> <b>the</b> Union in 1963, forming three separate divisions. While multiracial democracy was finally introduced to Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, however, Southern Rhodesians of European ancestry continued to enjoy minority rule.|$|E
5|$|In Great Britain, Lord Hillsborough, who had {{recently}} been appointed to the newly created office of Colonial Secretary, was alarmed {{by the actions of}} the Massachusetts House.

He also ordered Massachusetts Governor Francis Bernard to direct the Massachusetts House to rescind the letter. The house refused to comply.|$|E

5|$|After {{voting in}} favor of the Franco-African Community {{constitutional}} referendum of 28 September 1958, Gabon became pseudo-politically independent. Legislative elections were scheduled for 19 June 1960 through the Scrutin de Liste voting system, a form of bloc voting in which each party offers a list of candidates who the population vote for; the list that obtains a majority of votes is declared the winner and wins all the contested seats. Through the redistricting of district and constituency boundaries, the BDG arbitrarily received 244 seats, while the UDSG received 77. In the months that followed, the legislative majority was plagued by internal strife. M'ba, now President of Gabon, decided <b>to</b> <b>dissolve</b> <b>the</b> Assembly and looked to the opposition to strengthen his position.|$|E

5|$|At first, the dissenting deputies {{were often}} {{convinced}} or cowed back to withdraw their objections. Also, at first, the rule {{was used to}} strike down only individual laws, not <b>to</b> <b>dissolve</b> <b>the</b> chamber and throw out all measures passed. For example, as historian Władysław Czapliński describes in the Sejm of 1611 context, some resolutions were struck down, but others passed. From the mid-17th century onward, however, an objection to any item of Sejm legislation from a deputy or senator automatically caused other, earlier adopted legislation to be rejected. That was because all legislation that was adopted by a given Sejm formed a whole.|$|E
5|$|British colonial {{secretary}} Lord Hillsborough, {{hoping to}} prevent {{a repeat of the}} Stamp Act Congress, instructed the colonial governors in America <b>to</b> <b>dissolve</b> <b>the</b> assemblies if they responded to the Massachusetts Circular Letter. He also directed Massachusetts Governor Francis Bernard to have the Massachusetts House rescind the letter. On June 30, the House refused to rescind the letter by a vote of 92 to 17, with Adams citing their right to petition as justification. Far from complying with the governor's order, Adams instead presented a new petition to the king asking that Governor Bernard be removed from office. Bernard responded by dissolving the legislature.|$|E
5|$|By 1809 the territory's {{population}} had climbed to over 20,000. Congress passed legislation {{that allowed the}} Indiana Territory to elect a bicameral legislature and made the Legislative Council the upper house It also ordered Harrison <b>to</b> <b>dissolve</b> <b>the</b> existing one and created the Illinois Territory. The effect of these actions, was to cut the pro-slavery faction remaining in the Indiana Territory in half. The election resulted in a sweeping victory for the anti-slavery party. The new assembly quickly passed legislation revoking the indentured servitude laws of 1803, and introduced legislation to prevent its reintroduction. They also passed laws aimed at preventing slave hunters from removing escaped slaves from the state.|$|E

5|$|In March 2010, {{citing a}} drop in {{production}} and difficulty servicing significant debt {{as a result of}} the 1998 Mafco transaction, shareholder MacAndrews & Forbes agreed to a debt restructuring arrangement with Panavision's creditors. Private equity firm Cerberus Capital was the lead investor in the deal, which involved a US$140 million reduction in debt and a US$40 million cash infusion. In return the majority shareholder Ronald Perelman was required to relinquish control of Panavision, and he no longer has any equity in the company.

50|$|James Yawn, a {{well known}} amateur rocket experimentalist, advocates for <b>the</b> <b>dissolving</b> and heating method. <b>Dissolving</b> and heating <b>the</b> {{propellant}} actually <b>dissolves</b> both {{elements of the}} propellant and combines them. First, the KNO3 and sugar are placed in a pot or saucepan. Then, just enough water is added to be able <b>to</b> completely <b>dissolve</b> <b>the</b> KNO3 and the sugar. The mixture is then heated and brought to a boil until the water evaporates. The mixture will go through several stages, first boiling, then bubbling and spitting, then it will turn to a smooth creamy consistency. There are several advantages <b>to</b> <b>dissolving</b> <b>the</b> sugar and KNO3 in water before heating. One advantage is that the KNO3 and the sugar {{do not have to}} be finely powdered, because they both end up completely dissolved. This method of preparation also causes the resultant propellant to resist caramelization in the pot, giving more time to pack it into the motors.|$|R
5|$|In early January 2015, Ranariddh {{announced}} his intention <b>to</b> <b>dissolve</b> <b>the</b> CRPP {{and return to}} FUNCINPEC. At a party congress on 19 January 2015, he was reappointed as FUNCINPEC president; his half-sister and previous FUNCINPEC president, Norodom Arunrasmy became the first vice-president, while Nhek Bun Chhay was appointed as second vice-president. In March 2015, Ranariddh held another party congress where he appointed four more vice-presidents to the FUNCINPEC executive committee. He also convinced the congress to adopt a new party logo, which had a design almost identical that of the now-defunct CRPP. Ranariddh supported {{the formation of the}} Cambodian Royalist Youth Movement in July 2015, a youth organisation aimed at garnering electoral support for FUNCINPEC from younger voters, which he was appointed as its honorary president.|$|E

The Indian Election Commission ruled out early elections, citing the prevailing law and order situation, a decision the union government unsuccessfully appealed against in the Supreme Court. Elections were held in December and Modi returned to power.|$|E
5|$|Suu's {{signature}} {{was required}} to pass the ruling, but he referred the matter to the HNC to get their opinion. The HNC turned down the request. There was speculation the HNC did this {{as many of them}} were old, and therefore did not appreciate the generals' negativity towards seniors—some South Vietnamese mockingly called the HNC the High National Museum. On December 19, a Saturday, the generals moved <b>to</b> <b>dissolve</b> <b>the</b> HNC by arresting some of its members. The HNC had already ceased to function in any meaningful way, as only 9 of the 17 members were still occasionally attending its meetings, and few on a regular basis.|$|E
