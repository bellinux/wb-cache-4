Briefly returning to Britain at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, Harvey returned to the eastern seaboard of North America late in 1776 aboard HMS Mermaid, before transferring to the flagship of the North America Station HMS Eagle. From there Harvey joined HMS Liverpool on <b>temporary</b> <b>assignment,</b> only to be wrecked on Long Island aboard the frigate in 1778. Harvey rejoined Eagle after the wreck and returned to Britain in her. He was promoted to lieutenant on 25 February 1779.|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} United States Air Force combat unit {{to use the}} Silverplate B-29 was the 97th Bombardment Wing at Biggs Air Force Base in El Paso, Texas. In mid-1949 it {{received}} 27 of the aircraft from the 509th Bombardment Wing when the latter transitioned to B-50D bombers. The re-equipment of the 97th Bombardment Wing {{was part of an}} expansion of the atomic strike force to ten wings during 1949. Within a year all were converted to TB-29 trainers. One other Silverplate B-29, on <b>temporary</b> <b>assignment</b> in the United Kingdom, was converted into a weather reconnaissance aircraft (WB-29) and transferred to the 9th Bombardment Wing at Travis Air Force Base in California. The last Silverplate B-29 in service as a nuclear weapons carrier was reassigned to another role in November 1951, ending Silverplate after nearly eight years.|$|E

The Jabara family {{grocery store in}} Wichita was thronged with people for days, and both {{he and his father}} John appeared on local and national radio and television. Wichita mounted one of its most-attended parades in the city's history. Jabara was even sent on a goodwill tour with his father through the Middle East, and gave a speech in his father's hometown of Marjayoun, Lebanon. Film newsreels included footage of his aircraft and other accolades included his own song ("That Jabara Bird") and a ritual rewarding of his Distinguished Service Cross at a Boston baseball game. Jabara returned to the United States in May 1951 for <b>temporary</b> <b>assignment</b> to Air Force Headquarters, Washington, D.C. Two months later he was transferred to the Air Training Command at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. Upon his request, he returned for another tour of duty overseas, arriving in Korea in January 1953.|$|E

25|$|Ridley {{worked on}} the X-1 project until May 1948, when {{he was sent to}} the state of Washington for <b>temporary</b> <b>assignment</b> to the XB-47 program. The swept-wing Stratojet, powered by six J-47 {{turbojet}} engines and capable of high subsonic speeds, was in its way as revolutionary as the X-1 had been. His expertise proved instrumental in bringing the revolutionary jet bomber to operational status with the Strategic Air Command. A year later, the flight test engineer was permanently assigned to Muroc Army Air Field (soon to be renamed Edwards Air Force Base) where he remained, with interruptions, until 1956.|$|E
25|$|In May 1887 he {{was invited}} by the Meiji {{government}} to assume the post of first unofficial professor of sanitary engineering at Tokyo Imperial University (he lectured as an engineer), {{at a time when}} the country was dealing with several serious epidemics, notably cholera. His appointment was unusual in that Burton was largely self-educated, and did not come with the impressive educational or professional credentials that many of his contemporaries had. It is not known who recommended Burton to the Japanese government, or what inspired him to leave a promising career in London for what he believed to be a <b>temporary</b> <b>assignment</b> in Japan. He met Nagai Kyuichiro, an officer of the Sanitary Department of the Japan Home Ministry and of the Tokyo Imperial University, while Nagai was staying in London. Nagai invited him to Japan.|$|E

An apparently <b>temporary</b> <b>assignment</b> was prolonged in 1924. He signed a new contract for the following 4 years, though there was no professional progress recorded; he remained professor auxiliar temporal. It is not clear what his exact role was and in particular, whether he assumed senior teaching duties or rather performed junior academic roles; he is listed as auxiliary member of the Filosofía y Letras faculty staff in the late 1920s and in the early 1930s.|$|E
25|$|Arnold disliked {{infantry}} troop {{duties and}} volunteered to assist Capt. Arthur S.

Cowan returned to the United States following completion of the cartography detail, transferred to the Signal Corps, and was assigned to recruit two lieutenants to become pilots. Cowan contacted Arnold, who cabled his interest in also transferring to the Signal Corps but heard nothing in reply for two years. In June 1909, the 29th Infantry relocated to Fort Jay, New York, and en route to his new duty station by way of Paris, France, Arnold saw his first airplane in flight, piloted by Louis Blériot. In 1911, Arnold applied for transfer to the Ordnance Department because it offered an immediate promotion to first lieutenant.

500|$|When the new {{alignment}} for US27 {{was opened}} in early 1949, M-18 was re-extended north from Prudenville to Roscommon, where it turned northwesterly with M-76 to end at US27 south of Grayling. The completion of two freeways {{in the state}} shifted the termini of M-18 slightly in 1961. The southern terminus was moved north about a mile (1.6km) to the new US10 freeway, and the northern terminus was also shifted north about a mile to the new I-75/US27 freeway. The Michigan State Highway Department completed a freeway segment in 1970 in the Roscommon area for the modern I-75; in a <b>temporary</b> <b>assignment</b> they moved M-18/M-76 [...] onto that freeway. When {{the remainder of the}} freeway for I-75 was completed between Roscommon and West Branch in 1973, M-18 was rerouted at Roscommon to run northeasterly over the routing of M-144, a highway that had existed since 1940. Part of the former M-18/M-76 routing on the northwestern side of Roscommon was used for BL I-75.|$|E

She then sailed to San Francisco to collect 12 new Chinook and five UH-1 Iroquois helicopters for the Royal Australian Air Force, arriving in Australia with her cargo in April. In June, the carrier {{took part in}} Exercise Kangaroo in the Coral Sea, before returning to Sydney in July. On 11 July, the passenger liner SS Australis hit and damaged Melbourne in Sydney Harbour. In November, the carrier took part in disaster relief exercises. These were prophetic, as {{on the night of}} 24–25 December 1974, Cyclone Tracy destroyed the city of Darwin. Melbournes ship's company was recalled immediately from leave, the ship was loaded with supplies, and the carrier departed Sydney on 26 December in the company of [...] Melbourne, Brisbane, and eleven other ships were deployed as part of the largest peace-time rescue effort ever organised by the RAN: Operation Navy Help Darwin. Melbourne remained off Darwin until 18 January 1975, acting as operational headquarters and a helicopter base.
