500|$|Kevin Sacre, whose {{character}} was {{directly involved in}} the storyline, voiced his support for the plot stating: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that it's {{the sort of thing that}} happens in real life means it's something that should be addressed. Anyone who buries their head in the sand is a bit naïve. And I think soap is a medium where you can explore issues of real life." ...|$|E
500|$|At the Coroner's Inquest {{into the}} death of the Princess, on 13 February 2008, {{speaking}} by video-link from France, Tomlinson conceded that, after the interval of 16 or 17 years, he [...] "could not remember specifically" [...] whether the document he had seen during 1992 had in fact proposed the use of a strobe light to cause a traffic accident as a means of assassinating Milošević, although use of lights for this purpose had been covered in his MI6 training. On being told that no MI6 file on Henri Paul had been found, Tomlinson said that it [...] "would be absurd after 17 years to say I can positively disagree with it, but... I do not <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that they did not manage to find a file rules out anything either". He said he believed MI6 had an informant at the Paris Ritz but he could not be certain that this person was necessarily Henri Paul.|$|E

5000|$|Garvey {{describes}} her childhood as 'cosy, predictable and loving', and <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> her maternal grandmother {{lived with her}} family while {{she was growing up}} contributed to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> she now loves interviewing older women.Politically, she identifies as a feminist.|$|R
5000|$|Cipriano sees {{significant}} {{tension between}} {{federal and state}} product regulation, including those meant {{to protect the environment}} from contaminants that have been incorporated into products. She <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that states, not federal lawmakers, adopt and enforce most of these product regulations presents [...] "great challenges," [...] for manufacturers, distributors, and retailers in particular.|$|R
500|$|The {{tour of the}} United States faced various troubles. Ament {{said that}} the band and its crew had to [...] " [...] shows from the ground up, a venue {{everywhere}} we went." [...] In June 1995, the band was scheduled to play at San Francisco, California's Golden Gate Park in front of 50,000 people. Before the concert Vedder was forced to stay at a hospital after suffering {{from the effects of}} food poisoning. Vedder left the hospital to play the show, however {{he was not able to}} finish and ended up performing just seven out of twenty-one songs with the band. Neil Young filled in for Vedder for the rest of the show that day. Vedder said, [...] "That whole [...] thing was a blur based on some bad food. It was really, really bad. Looking back at it, it doesn't seem as intense as it was, but it was horrible. I just felt not human and looking back I should have got through that show somehow, and I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Neil [...] was there made me feel like I could get off the hook in some way and I did go out for a few songs." [...] Because of Vedder's health the band was forced to cancel the remaining dates of its tour of the United States. Some dates were reinstated while the rest were rescheduled for the fall. About canceling the dates, Vedder said, [...] "I think we all agreed that it had gotten insane, that it was no longer about the music." [...] Ament later said, [...] "We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on our own, and it pretty much killed us, killed our career." ...|$|E

There’s no mention of Satan or dancing with Satan or anything like that. There’s nothing disrespectful on this record; it’s really beautiful." ...|$|E
2500|$|After President George W. Bush {{nominated}} White House Counsel Harriet Miers on October 3, 2005, {{for a seat}} on the U.S. Supreme Court, DeWine said [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> she doesn't have judicial {{experience will}} add to the diversity of the Supreme Court.... There is no reason everyone has to have that same [...] background." [...] Opposition from conservative groups unhappy with Miers' resume ultimately sank her nomination.|$|E
5000|$|Thanks {{largely to}} Oregon's experience, many reform-minded advocates and policymakers have become persuaded that vote-by-mail stimulates {{increased}} voter turnout with few drawbacks. We <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> don't support their arguments. VBM reinforces the stratification of the electorate; it's more amenable to both fraud and manipulation than voting at polling places; and it depends {{too much on}} the reliability of the U.S. Postal Service.|$|R

'I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> do call for an explanation,' he replied. 'Well, to begin with, I wasn't after the spoons.' ...|$|R

2500|$|Sulley, {{when asked}} (in 2004) {{to pick the}} {{highlight}} of her career, said: [...] "I think it's still happening. I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> we're still doing it now. After all these years – I'm 41 now, and really, I shouldn't be in a pop group any more, but I am and it's still my job! I {{wake up in the}} morning and I haven't got to go to a nine-to-five.

Shortly before the film's release, Kean said, [...] "People in both parties didn't particularly like the commission report, and I think people in both parties aren't going to love this one". In response to one particular scene, Kean told an interviewer he [...] "was all right with the made-up scene" [...] where Clinton administration is accused of blocking a chance to kill bin Laden, saying [...] "I don’t <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> are clear." [...] Just weeks before the broadcast he [...] "asked for changes that would address complaints raised by the former Clinton aides and that ABC is considering his request." ...|$|R

5000|$|In 2012, the Guinness Book of World Records {{recognized}} Frank and Louie as the world's oldest living janus cat. This was {{an uncommon}} distinction due to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> most janus cats die within days.

"The war cannot {{have had}} much effect to your prejudice, as grain {{of all sorts}} bore a high price; and I should <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that large armies were near by, to consume {{everything}} you had to sell, and that at high prices, more than compensated for any disadvantage it might have induced.

[...] "Oh, a new religion," [...] said Flambeau, laughing; [...] "one of those new {{religions}} that forgive your sins by saying you never had any. Rather like Christian Science, I should <b>think.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> is that a fellow calling himself Kalon (I don't know what his name is, except that it can't be that) has taken the flat just above me.

6000|$|... "And that's all {{the good}} you have {{obtained}} from three perusals of the Commentaries on Scottish Criminal Jurisprudence?" [...] said his companion.

5000|$|Nicholas Kaldor {{has long}} {{recognized}} the price-stabilizing role of speculators, {{who tend to}} even out [...] "price-fluctuations due {{to changes in the}} conditions of demand or supply," [...] by possessing [...] "better than average foresight." [...] This view was later echoed by the speculator Victor Niederhoffer, in [...] "The Speculator as Hero", who describes the benefits of speculation:Let's consider some of the principles that explain the causes of shortages and surpluses and the role of speculators. When a harvest is too small to satisfy consumption at its normal rate, speculators come in, hoping to profit from the scarcity by buying. Their purchases raise the price, thereby checking consumption so that the smaller supply will last longer. Producers encouraged by the high price further lessen the shortage by growing or importing to reduce the shortage. On the other side, when the price is higher than <b>the</b> speculators <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> warrant, they sell. This reduces prices, encouraging consumption and exports and helping to reduce the surplus.|$|R
