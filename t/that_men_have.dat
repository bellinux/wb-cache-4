5|$|In 1993 the {{evolutionary}} biologist Stephen Jay Gould compared Paley to Voltaire's Doctor Pangloss, {{the man who}} could argue any case (however hopeless). Gould is struck that Paley can claim that even the agonising pain of gallstones or gout could indicate the goodness of a loving God, with the justification that it felt so good when the pain stopped. Gould makes it clear he finds Paley's argument incorrect scientifically, but states that he respects it as a coherent and well-defended philosophy. Gould particularly respects Paley's method of identifying alternative possibilities and then systematically refuting them. Gould notes that Paley envisages a Lamarckist kind of evolution and rebuts it with the observation <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>have</b> not lost their nipples through disuse. However, Gould writes, Paley did not manage to think of one more alternative, natural selection, which has no purpose at all but just kills off whatever works less well in every generation.|$|E

Her friend Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) tells Liz that she is coming off as more confident since starting {{her relationship with her}} boyfriend Carol (Matt Damon). Liz decides to use her new-found confidence to help TGS with Tracy Jordan producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) with a problem he has had with a difficult television editor named Ritchie (Paul Giamatti). Liz visits him in the editing room and hopes to convince him to get TGSs show's opener footage finished as soon as possible in which she is successful after flirting with Ritchie. Later, Liz learns that Ritchie is spreading a rumor that the two are sleeping together. She confronts Ritchie about it, he admits to starting the rumor {{in order to get the}} attention of his assistant editor Donna (Joanna Adler). Later, Liz and Ritchie have a pretend break-up in front of Donna, and Donna becomes interested in Ritchie.|$|E

25|$|Some Christians {{believe that}} the God worshiped by the Hebrew people of the pre-Christian era had always {{revealed}} himself as he did through Jesus; but that this was never obvious until Jesus was born (see John 1). Also, though the Angel of the Lord spoke to the Patriarchs, revealing God to them, some believe {{it has always been}} only through the Spirit of God granting them understanding, <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>have</b> been able to later perceive that they had been visited by God himself.|$|E
25|$|Studies suggest gender {{differences}} in the reminiscence bump. Researchers found <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>have</b> more positive life events in their thirties and that women have more positive life events in their twenties. This finding suggests that the timing of important positive life events, such as marriage or employment, differ for men and women. Most of the major life events start between the age of 15 and 30 but there is a small gender difference shown here with respect to when the event takes place. Researchers found that women have a slightly earlier bump than men. The earlier age of the bump in women may be attributed to earlier hormonal changes in adolescence.|$|E

500|$|However, {{while women}} and {{minorities}} are both viewed as [...] "subversive" [...] and are restricted by the patriarchal society depicted in the novel, Lena Grove is able to travel safely and be cared for by people who hate and mistrust her, because she plays on the conventional rule that men are responsible for a woman's wellbeing. Thus, {{she is the only}} stranger who is not alienated and destroyed by the people of Jefferson, because the community recognizes her as the embodiment of nature and life. This romantic view of women in the novel posits <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>have</b> lost their innocent connection to the natural world, while women instinctively possess it.|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Cerankowski and Milks {{edited and}} {{published}} Asexualities: Feminist and Queer Perspectives, {{a collection of}} essays intended to explore the politics of asexuality from a feminist and queer perspective. It is broken into the introduction and then six parts: Theorizing Asexuality: New Orientations; The Politics of Asexuality; Visualizing Asexuality in Media Culture; Asexuality and Masculinity; Health, Disability, and Medicalization; and Reading Asexually: Asexual Literary Theory. Each part contains two to three papers on a given aspect of asexuality research. One such paper is written by Ela Przybylo, another name that is becoming common in asexual scholarly literature. Her article, with regard to the Cerankowski and Milks anthology, focuses on accounts by self-identified male asexuals, with a particular focus on the pressures men experience towards having sex in dominant Western discourse and media. Three men living in Southern Ontario, Canada, were interviewed in 2011, and Przybylo admits that the small sample-size means that her findings cannot be generalized to a greater population in terms of representation, and that they are [...] "exploratory and provisional," [...] especially in a field that is still lacking in theorizations. All three interviewees addressed being affected by the stereotype <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>have</b> to enjoy and want sex in order to be [...] "real men." ...|$|E

It was the first song written by Milian for the album, and she worked with Bloodshy for the song's production. The album's second and final single, [...] "When You Look at Me", was written by Milian. Using her school days as the inspiration for the song, Milian said that [...] "when I was growing up, I found people were always trying to label me. The first day of school it would be like 'Here comes this girl all dressed up. She thinks she's all that' and they didn't even know me. The message behind 'When You Look At Me' is never judge a book by its cover." [...] Milian asked Ja Rule to appear on her album, however {{she did not want to}} put him [...] "on just any song", and wanted to make sure it was the right song for him. Milian hoped Ja Rule would appear on the track [...] "A Girl Like Me", but he ended up rapping on [...] "Get Away".

2500|$|At {{a recent}} {{conference at the}} American Society of Human Genetics, there was a study {{presented}} by Melissa Wilson Sayres from the University of California Berkeley which called into question the amount to which people had more female ancestors than male.

2500|$|Enough is {{a thriller}} film which also details an abusive relationship.

2500|$|One {{factor that}} shows {{insignificant}} differences {{between male and}} female aggression is in sports. In sports, the rate of aggression in both contact and non-contact sports is relatively equal. Since the establishment of Title IX, female sports have increased in competitiveness and importance, which could contribute to the evening of aggression and the [...] "need to win" [...] attitude between both genders. Among sex differences found in adult sports were that females have a higher scale of indirect hostility while men have a higher scale of assault. Another difference found is <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>have</b> up to 20 times higher levels of testosterone than women.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has also}} been {{discovered}} {{that there is no}} scientific research that directly links naturally high testosterone levels to women’s success in sports. [...] Most people assume that women with high levels of testosterone will be more athletic because they know <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>have</b> higher levels of testosterone and are usually seen to have more athletic prowess than their female counterparts. [...] Even though testosterone can be a factor in athletic ability, so can a number of other factors, like “physique, thermoregulation, biomechanics, oxygen uptake, training, and genetics, as well as the psychological and the social”. [...] The policy also does not distinguish between natural and enhanced testosterone, and many believe that only doping on testosterone should be regulated against because regulating anything else is just another form of covert discrimination.|$|E

[...] Trying to win them over by tactics, he tells them to go to his brother Gloucester, who will reward them better for his life than Edward will for his death. One murderer insists Gloucester himself sent them to perform the bloody act, but Clarence does not believe him. He recalls the unity of Richard Duke of York blessing his three sons with his victorious arm, bidding his brother Gloucester to [...] "think on this and he will weep." [...] Sardonically, a murderer says Gloucester weeps millstones – echoing Richard's earlier comment about the murderers' own eyes weeping millstones rather than [...] "foolish tears" [...] (ActI, Sc. 3).|$|E
2500|$|Some fathers' {{rights advocates}} have sought {{the right to}} prevent women from having an {{abortion}} without the father's consent, {{on the basis that}} it is discriminatory for men not {{to have the ability to}} participate in a decision to terminate a pregnancy.

[...] Advocates have also expressed the desire to have a [...] "financial abortion" [...] in which the option exists to sever all responsibility for child support for an unwanted child. Commenting on this, legal scholar Kim Buchanan states, [...] "The only way men's lack of a pregnancy opt-out can be framed as a gender injustice is to accept <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>have</b> a right to visit the consequences of unprotected sex (or contraceptive failure) exclusively on their female partners."
