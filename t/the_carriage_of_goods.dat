The population of the area remained low, and the primary income source remained <b>the</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> to and from farms.

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1820s, {{however, the}} {{economic}} climate of the country had deteriorated, and many investors were waiting to see how the new Liverpool and Manchester Railway would succeed. Moreover, not everyone shared the dream. For most people the canals were adequate for <b>the</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> while few travelled very far. Most people lived their lives within a few miles of their birthplace. The later story of the railways was a classic one of a product generating a demand, {{rather than the other way}} around. Thus, what investment that was forthcoming was for ventures for which a need could be clearly perceived, with a reasonable expectation of a good, and rapid, return. Although the surveys were useful in the planning of later lines, the three were never built.|$|E
25|$|In 1848, <b>the</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> {{earned the}} company £9,049. The railway company began {{operating}} as a carrier soon afterwards, on a fairly small scale, and this continued until 1894, {{by which time}} most of the trade was in cotton. Trade in the return direction dwindled, {{to the point where}} the operation was uneconomic, and ceased. In 1905, boats using the canal carried coal, raw cotton, grain, which was supplied to textile and flour mills, and stone, but by this time traffic volumes were small. On 29 February 1912, the canal burst its banks at Kerridge, flooding several nearby streets. The cause was the failure of a culvert that carried Tinkers Brook under the canal embankment, at about 1:00 am. By the time the bridges could be stopped with stop planks, most of the upper pound above Bosley locks had drained away. It took three weeks to repair the breach, and around 100 men were employed to fill the gap with 160 boat loads of clay puddle and other materials.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea that}} the rivers Mersey and Irwell should be made navigable from the Mersey Estuary {{in the west to}} Manchester in the east was first {{proposed}} in 1660, and revived in 1712 by the English civil engineer Thomas Steers. The necessary legislation was proposed in 1720, and the Act of Parliament for the navigation passed into law in 1721. Construction began in 1724, undertaken by the Mersey & Irwell Navigation Company. By 1734 boats [...] "of moderate size" [...] were able to make the journey from quays near Water Street in Manchester to the Irish Sea, but the navigation was only suitable for small ships; during periods of low rainfall or when strong easterly winds held back the tide in the estuary, there was not always sufficient depth of water for a fully laden boat. The completion in 1776 of the Runcorn extension of the Bridgewater Canal, followed in 1830 by the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, intensified competition for <b>the</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods.</b> In 1825 an application had been made to Parliament for an Act to allow the construction of a ship canal between the mouth of the River Dee and Manchester at a cost of £1million, but [...] "the necessary forms not having been observed", it did not become law. In 1844 ownership of the Mersey & Irwell Navigation was transferred to the Bridgewater Trustees, and in 1872 it was sold to The Bridgewater Navigation Company for £1.112million. The navigation had by then fallen into disrepair, its owners preferring instead to maintain the more profitable canal; in 1882 the navigation was described as being [...] "hopelessly choked with silt and filth", and was closed to all but the smaller boats for 264 out of 311working days.|$|E

2500|$|Whether {{or not the}} {{usefulness}} of a navigable route from the inland lake of Lough Neagh to Carlingford Lough, on the coast {{to the south of}} Lough Neagh was considered before the 1640s is unknown, but during Oliver Cromwell's campaign in Ireland at that time, a survey of the area was made, and Colonel Monk ordered that a navigable trench from Portadown to Newry should be cut. Despite the order, no work was carried out, nor was it when Francis Nevil, a tax collector for the government, made a similar survey and proposal in 1703. Shortly afterwards, the Tyrone coalfield was discovered, and there was pressure to provide a route for the coal to reach Dublin. A bill was put before parliament in 1715, for works to improve drainage and <b>the</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> but failed to become an Act of Parliament, and there was a gradual realisation that a local area such as this could provide neither the capital nor the expertise for such undertakings. [...] In order to address the situation, the Irish Parliament in 1717 offered a reward of £1,000 to the first person to produce 500 tons of native coal in Dublin and the Commissioners of Inland Navigation for Ireland were set up in 1729, consisting of three high officials from the government, four bishops, and eighty responsible persons, who would oversee all matters concerned with inland waterways.|$|E
