50|$|The male is {{distinguished}} from other species by an inconspicuous basal <b>tegular</b> projection on the palps and a tibial apophysis (i.e. a projection) with two similarly sized branches, and the retrolateral one {{is large and}} has an apical spine.|$|E
50|$|Neoheterophrictus {{is similar}} to Heterophrictus and Plesiophrictus, however the females differ by having a {{different}} spermathecae structure, which have two receptacles with many lobes/termini at the end. Males are distinguished from Plesiophrictus {{by the absence of}} a <b>tegular</b> keel on the male palpal bulb. It occurs in the Western Ghats, India.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Each tegula (a) {{overlaps}} the one {{below it}} and its raised lateral borders tapering in to nestle between its lower tile's upper border. Each curved imbrex (b) covers the side ridges of the joints formed between adjacent tegulae. Some imbrices are not shown in order to reveal {{the details of the}} <b>tegular</b> joints.|$|E
50|$|The male palp have proximal-distal axis. The tegulum is subrectangular, and the {{conductor}} and embolus together form an apical complex moving distally. The conductor is moderately sclerotized and broad with a helical ridge fringed with distinct papillae, and hooked distally. <b>Tegular</b> division is slightly {{longer than the}} embolic division. The cymbium has several prolateral macrosetae.|$|E
50|$|Male spiders {{placed in}} the genus Pandava differ from other species of Titanoecidae in {{features}} of the palpal bulb: the <b>tegular</b> process (a projection from the tegulum) is smaller; the median apophysis (one of the hardened plates making up the palpal bulb) is thumb-shaped. Females differ in features of the epigynum: the copulatory openings are more anterior.|$|E
50|$|Theridula is a genus of cobweb spiders, {{found in}} many (mostly tropical) parts of the world. Species vary in size from 1 to 3.5 mm in length.In females, the abdomen is wider than long, with a hump or horn on each side, and {{sometimes}} a posterior median horn. The pedipalp in males is simple, lacking a conductor or theridioid <b>tegular</b> apophysis.|$|E
5000|$|Fortification of {{historical}} significance, the castra of Tihău was called since the 18th century [...] "citadel of Tuhutum". Ruins on the plateau [...] "Grădiște" [...] {{shows that the}} Castra of Tihău was a Roman fort of auxiliary troop, pertaining to the northwest sector of Dacic limes. Repeated discoveries of Roman archaeological materials (pottery, tiles and bricks, arms, tools, diverse objects, <b>tegular</b> stamps, coins, even stone inscriptions etc.), advanced knowledges {{in the realm of}} history and archeology of Roman Dacia, all together, confirm the nature, the chronological placement, appurtenance and Roman military-defensive role of [...] "fort" [...] that formerly erected in this place from the confluence of Almaș and Someș River.|$|E
5000|$|Burmesarchaea grimaldii is {{only known}} {{from a single}} male {{specimen}} preserved in amber. It is a small spider, with a body length of just under 2 mm. Characteristic of the family Archaeidae, the head region is raised up from the thorax, although without the distinctive [...] "neck" [...] found in other genera in the family. It is presumed to have eight eyes (the posterior median eye is not visible); the anterior median eye is the largest. The chelicerae ("jaws") are long relative to the body at about 0.8 mm, and project forward at about 45 degrees. The longest leg, the first, is 3.3 mm long; the shortest, the third, is 1.7 mm long. All the legs are without spines. The pedipalp has a large, rounded bulb with a spoon-shaped embolus and bent <b>tegular</b> apophysis.|$|E
