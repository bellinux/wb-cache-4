3000|$|The {{situation}} is different {{for the role}} of employers’ supply in regard to employees’ participation in further training. One the one hand, the role of employers as gate-keepers is obvious: their provision of <b>training</b> <b>leave</b> and financial support encourages their employees’ inclination to engage in further training (see model 1 in Table  2). On the other hand, their provision of further training opportunities has not been affected by the trend of modernisation (see models 2 and 3 in Table  2). This means that hypothesis 3 is not confirmed empirically since it was assumed that the more pronounced the economic modernisation, {{the more likely it is}} that employers will offer their trainable employees a release from work for the duration of their further training or a financial support for the participation in further training. However, controlling for individual and structural characteristic, there is a significant period effect of labour market situation on employers’ supply in relation to employees’ participation in further education. This is partly in line with hypothesis 4 stressing that the more favourable the labour market conditions become in the course of an economic upturn, the more likely it is that employers will offer further training opportunities (<b>training</b> <b>leave</b> and financial support) to their employees. They do this solely for business reasons but not in a reaction to the requirements of modernisation in terms of technological change or tertiarisation. This conclusion will be supported by the negative life-cycle effect, which indicates that employers make this offer only for younger employers with relatively less labour force experience in order to obtain the benefits of these early and cost-effective human capital investments for the rest of their employees’ work life. 14 [...]...|$|E
30|$|Due to {{previous}} investments in firm-specific human capital, employers are obviously {{not interested in}} laying off participants in on-the-job further training. This is particularly valid for well-trained employees. If employers had invested in these employees by giving them <b>training</b> <b>leave</b> and financial support, premature dismissal would mean the employers missed out on the gains, while being left with the costs, of previous investments in human capital (model 1). In reverse, in {{a case where the}} employer released employees so they could participate in further training, or paid for them to do so, the participants are less likely to give notice or terminate an employment contract by mutual agreement (models 2 and 3). The (expected) gains of previous further training or repayment clauses might keep the employees from leaving the company (prematurely). It could be assumed that this is particularly valid for firm-specific further training since generally and vocationally educated and trained employees show higher probabilities of quitting the employment relationship (model 2) or for bringing about the consensual suspension of the labour contract (model 3).|$|E
30|$|Because of {{the costs}} {{involved}} in further training, larger—and thus usually financially more sound—companies are more capable of making such investments (Bellmann et al. 2014; Gerhards et al. 2012; Bellmann et al. 2010 : 46 – 47; Neubäumer 2008 : 35; Wolter et al. 2006). If they experience economic hardship {{as a result of}} recession then it is to be expected that they will reduce spending on professional development opportunities (Bellmann et al. 2014 : 14 – 15; Dietrich and Kruppe 2009 : 259). Due to their reduced ability to pay for costly within-firm further training arrangements in periods of economic downturn, however, small companies are expected to completely desist from investing in continuous vocational training on the job (Schömann and Becker 1995). Overall, for economic reasons, this leads to a decline in their employees’ opportunities for further training, compared to employees’ chances in bigger firms. As a consequence, in an economic downturn, a majority of employees find themselves without supplementary or new qualifications which have by that time become necessary. Consequently, companies are forced to invest in their employees’ further training in times of increasingly favourable economic cycles and labour market situations in order to meet their increasing demand for qualified manpower. Therefore, the more favourable labour market conditions become in the course of an economic upturn, {{the more likely it is}} that employers will offer further training opportunities (<b>training</b> <b>leave</b> and financial support) to their employees (Hypothesis 4).|$|E

40|$|Increased {{state and}} federal {{accountability}} measures have made the assessment of student performance {{one of the most}} critical responsibilities of classroom teachers; yet, inadequate opportunities for preservice and inservice <b>training</b> <b>leave</b> many teachers feeling ill-prepared for this task. Adding to the complexity of building teachers’ assessment literacy is the relationship between assessment beliefs and classroom assessment practices. This quantitative study utilizes a validated, online survey to examine how elementary teachers’ (n = 79) define their assessment beliefs (conceptions) and how these beliefs influence which assessment practices are valued within the classroom. Findings suggest that despite teachers’ limited exposure to assessment training, four distinct assessment beliefs exist within the elementary classroom: assessment for school accountability, assessment for student certification, assessment for improvement of teaching and learning, and assessment as irrelevant. Assessment for the improvement of teaching and learning yielded the highest composite mean and was negatively correlated with the irrelevance belief and positively related to school accountability. An analysis of the importance of assessment practices revealed authentic assessments, short answers, teacher-made assessments, and performance assessments as the most valued, while publisher assessments and major exams had the lowest means. Significant relationships were identified between demographics and beliefs and practices, with the most practical findings related to exposure to assessment training and level of degree attainment. Significant relationships were also noted between all beliefs and the value of specific assessment practices, with the exception of the irrelevance belief. No significant relationships were noted between the irrelevant belief and value of assessment practices; however, many negative correlations were documented. Results are discussed in light of other research, indicating that a greater understanding of assessment beliefs and importance of practices can contribute to the development of relevant professional development aimed at the improvement of teachers’ assessment pedagogies and practices can contribute to greater educational success...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an ethnographic study of intercultural {{education}} discourses and everyday practices {{in an urban}} Greek-Cypriot primary school. The pupil population is comprised of Greek-Cypriots, Eastern European economic migrants and increasing numbers of newlyarrived Iraqi-Palestinian asylum-seekers. Despite the introduction of intercultural education policy in 2001, the education system prescribes a monoculturalist and nationalist ethos. At the same time, the limited opportunities for intercultural education <b>training</b> <b>leave</b> teachers uncertain {{as to how to}} respond to the increasing diversity. Informed by ethnographic, discursive and intersectional approaches, this study analyses data from fieldwork conducted in this school for a total of three months over a period of three years. The analysis identifies the discursive resources from which teachers draw to talk about diversity in Greek-Cypriot society and construct the Other, mainly in essentialist and negative ways. It also identifies teachers' constructions of racism on a societal and educational level, including racism denials, minimizations and justifications. The thesis argues that teachers' constructions of racism inhibit them from recognizing and challenging institutional racism and racialized incidents they observe among their pupils. The study also demonstrates how minoritized children become differentially racialized as groups and individuals through institutional, teachers' and children's discourses and practices, regardless of intentionality. As a result, many minoritized children experience school in an environment of harassment. The study discusses the experiences of an Iraqi-Palestinian boy {{as an example of how}} intercultural education is implemented. Some teachers' resistance to the dominant discourses of colourblindness and racism denial, and minoritized children's negotiation of their racialized positionings create the spaces of ambivalence that are necessary for change. The findings bear implications for policy and practice in terms of teacher training, development of antiracist policies and supportive networks for teachers, changes in the curriculum, and, structural transformations, so that educational opportunities are equally provided to all children...|$|E
40|$|Is Australia the new {{economic}} and social model for the world, asks Peter Auer in the Australian Review of Public Affairs SOME EUROPEAN countries, led by Denmark, are successful, both economically and socially, and Australia could learn from their policy approaches. But is all the learning to be had uni-directional, now that Australia seems to be weathering the recession {{so much better than}} even the best European performers? Previously it seemed that Denmark (and some other smaller European countries, such as the Netherlands and, with some reservations, Austria, Finland and Sweden) had found the right balance between economic efficiency and social equity. Indeed, along with other European scholars, I have claimed that the Danish model had the dynamism of the United States, without its social problems. In recent decades, Denmark has developed labour market regulation combining loose employment protection, which allow for high labour market mobility, with generous income and employability protection. The Danish model also enables effective integration of working and family life through generous maternity, parental and <b>training</b> <b>leave.</b> Taken together, these measures thus constitute insurance against the different labour market risks that individuals may face over their life course, such as unemployment, transitions between jobs, between parenthood and jobs, and between jobs and retirement. This system has been called “protected mobility”, “transitional labour markets” or simply “labour market security”. However, the different elements of which it is composed—loose employment protection, generous passive and active labour market policies, ample training and family-related leaves, and the social dialogue and collective bargaining for arriving at such a package deal—have become the model for labour market reforms in the European Union under the name of “flexicurity”. The global financial crisis seems to have changed everything. In a recent column, the Sydney Morning Herald’s Peter Hartcher wrote that “Australia is the country that seems to have achieved a sweet spot, combining the vigour of American capitalism with the humanity of European welfare, yet suffering the drawbacks of neither” [...] .

40|$|Leave {{means that}} an {{employee}} works {{not at all}} or less, while the contract remains in force. During parental leave, care leave or educational leave, the employee is given time for caring responsibilities or training, but leave usually does not {{serve the interests of}} the employer. There are three types of leave arrangements: (1) the right for leave for a specific purpose when the employee meets the requirements, (2) leave saving and (3) leave after a special request when the employee does not fulfill the criterion of the law or of a collective arrangement. The legal framework for this is the standard of a good employer and a good employee. The current study investigates the juridical obstacles of taking leave. The research shows that four obstacles can be identified. Firstly, often employees do not know in advance whether an employer allows leave. This uncertainty is caused by the use of open standards. In the Dutch system an employee is oft entitled to leave after an assessment of interests of the employer and the employee. Therefore, the Dutch system is flexible, but an employee with a private duty is not always sure he can take leave. In Belgium however, the employee is entitled to leave (Tijdskrediet), in case he has fulfilled all conditions of the standard. The Belgian scheme provides certainty, but gives little room for customized solutions. A second obstacle is that generally leave is unpaid, because the employee is in principle not entitled to wages. However, some types of leave are paid according to the law, a collective agreement or an individual agreement. The obstacles of unpaid leave may be overcome by using leave savings as income provisions. Examples are the proposed concept of the so-called Levensloop-WW (life course unemployment act) of Hermans & Pennings (2006) and the proposed Work Budget (Werkbudget, Commissie arbeidsparticipatie, 2008). If the employee is paid during parental leave or <b>training</b> <b>leave,</b> in the case of change of employer a third problem may arise: the ability of the old employer to reclaim salary paid during leave. The limits under which reclaiming salary is legally acceptable are unclear. This may lead to a sense of insecurity for employees. A forth obstacle to take leave is the risk that an employee might be disadvantaged by taking leave. The case law shows that leave can lead to demotion, missing employee benefits, a deterioration of the employment relationship or dismissal. Employees with a temporary contract may fear that the contract will not be renewed. The current standards of leave are unsatisfactory for an employee with family responsibilities and a labour market where it is expected that an employees knowledge is constantly up to date...|$|E
