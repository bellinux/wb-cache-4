50|$|BRUTEs were a wheeled platform, {{generally}} with mesh {{around three}} {{sides of the}} body, the fourth side being open with canvas (or later plastic) straps for restraint of the load. The front included a panel for notes to be chalked to help sort traffic. A few BRUTEs had just the front, for carrying bulky loads {{too big for the}} cage, or two hinged ramps (no sides) to load or unload BRUTEs into railway vans. Each BRUTE had two fixed wheels at the rear and two swivelling caster wheels at the front, with polyurethane tyres and <b>taper</b> <b>bearings.</b> Coupling were at front and rear, the front being a pin, the rear a hinged loop on a sprung shaft. A lever on the front operated brakes on the rear wheels and lifted the coupling pin.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{practical}} applications of rolling cones {{is the use of}} <b>tapered</b> roller <b>bearings</b> in rotating devices. <b>Tapered</b> <b>bearings</b> can bear higher loads than ball bearings in both radial and axial directions, and therefore are more frequently used as wheel bearings in most wheeled land vehicles.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tapered</b> roller <b>{{bearings}}</b> use conical rollers {{that run}} on conical races. Most roller bearings only take radial or axial loads, but <b>tapered</b> roller <b>bearings</b> support both radial and axial loads, and generally can carry higher loads than ball bearings due to greater contact area. <b>Tapered</b> roller <b>bearings</b> are used, for example, as the wheel bearings of most wheeled land vehicles. The downsides to this bearing is that due to manufacturing complexities, <b>tapered</b> roller <b>bearings</b> are usually more expensive than ball bearings; and additionally under heavy loads the tapered roller is like a wedge and bearing loads tend to try to eject the roller; the force from the collar which keeps the roller in the bearing adds to bearing friction compared to ball bearings.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} experiments per-formed towards diagnosis of localized defects in <b>tapered</b> roller <b>bearings,</b> using High Frequency Resonance Technique (HFRT). A special {{feature of the}} work is that instead of using analog filter and envelope detector for HFRT, digital filtering and envelope detection were used. To practically test this technique, an experimental setup was designed and fabricated for testing various <b>tapered</b> roller <b>bearings</b> to obtain their vibration characteristics. For the purpose of testing, a few defect-free and defective <b>tapered</b> roller <b>bearings</b> were tested using the fabricated set up-the defective bearings tested included bearings with outer race defects, roller defects and combination of both.

Using data fusion techniques, two different monitoring technologies, oil debris analysis and vibration, were integrated into a health monitoring system for detecting bearing surface fatigue pitting damage.

40|$|This paper evaluates two {{different}} journal bearings: a cylindrical bore plain journal bearing and a tri-lobe <b>taper</b> land <b>bearing.</b> Each bearing {{has the same}} nominal diameter (89 mm) and aspect ratio (L/D = 0. 7). The shaft rotational speed ranged from 6 krpm to 14 krpm and the bearing specific load from 700 kPa to 2800 kPa. The bearings' steady-state performance is evaluated according to relative bearing and shaft displacement, bearing operating temperature and power loss. A frequency-domain analysis is used to determine bearing rotordynamic coefficients - it treats the bearing as a mass-spring-damper system. Excitation frequencies range between 20 Hz and 350 Hz. Ultimately, the tri-lobe <b>taper</b> land <b>bearing</b> offers better stability whereas the cylindrical bore plain journal bearing has a lower eccentricity and runs cooler for a given operating condition. The dynamic properties of the two bearings {{are found to be}} similar, although the higher stability of the tri-lobe <b>taper</b> land <b>bearing</b> is also reflected in the dynamic coefficients.
