5|$|Altogether, around fifty Christian {{artifacts}} {{were found}} in Hasekura's estate in 1640, such as crosses, rosaries, religious gowns and religious paintings. <b>The</b> <b>artifacts</b> were seized and stored by the Date fief. An inventory was made again in 1840 describing the items as belonging to Hasekura Tsunenaga. Nineteen books were also mentioned in the inventory, {{but they have been}} lost since. <b>The</b> <b>artifacts</b> are today preserved in the Sendai City Museum and other museums in Sendai.|$|E
5|$|During an {{excavation}} in 2004, archaeologists discovered cultural remains {{buried by}} the 1815 eruption. <b>The</b> <b>artifacts</b> were preserved in their 1815 {{positions at the}} site.|$|E

As Yotsuga walks towards the dumpsters to dispose of {{a small piece of}} <b>the</b> <b>artifact,</b> <b>the</b> world splits into two. In one world, Yotsuga tosses away the piece and <b>the</b> <b>artifact</b> is destroyed. In the other world, Yotsuga keeps <b>the</b> <b>artifact,</b> leading to <b>the</b> discovery of extraterrestrial technology that changes history.|$|R

5|$|The {{construction}} team began site excavation on March 3. Workers excavated artifacts {{dating to}} around 1150 AD. Fire pits and broken pieces of ceramic pans {{were found in}} the ground below what would be left field. Archaeologists believe the area was the site of a Native American settlement and that <b>the</b> <b>artifacts</b> were the remnants of a workshop where mineral water from underground sulfur-bearing springs was boiled to collect salt. <b>The</b> <b>artifacts</b> are on permanent display in the Tennessee State Museum's Mississippian Period exhibit. A portion of the property was used as a city cemetery in the 1800s. The interred were relocated.|$|E

5|$|After a gap {{of several}} decades, {{in the early}} 1980s, Vimala Begley studied the {{ceramics}} find of the site and proposed a preliminary version of the chronology of the occupation of the site. At {{the same time she}} started researching on the beads, organized a proper sequential display of <b>the</b> <b>artifacts</b> of the site at the Pondicherry Museum, and brought out an information brochure.|$|E
5|$|After {{sufficiently}} {{upgrading the}} ship and exploring the map, the player is allowed to buy the three powerful artifacts, which then spawn at random ports. Defeating the Ancient Guardian in a card minigame awards the player additional loot and previously unavailable upgrades. Ancient Trader does not include a saving feature, which means that all progress is lost if the game is closed. An online multiplayer mode allows for several players to simultaneously play the same map, chase <b>the</b> <b>artifacts,</b> and defeat the Guardian. The prices of <b>the</b> <b>artifacts</b> increase as other players buy them. The players can check the wealth and artifacts gained by other players. The game also includes several alternative game modes, which focus on reaching a set total wealth or cash tally before other players. The multiplayer does not include an online scoreboard.|$|E

The U.S. {{government}} agents approach him {{with regard to}} the Ark's recovery, and he sets up a meeting between them and Indiana Jones. Spielberg hired Elliott as he was a big fan of the actor, who had performed in some of his favorite British and American films.|$|E
5000|$|DeathSpank {{is set in}} {{a fantasy}} medieval world. It {{revolves}} around a character named DeathSpank, who has searched his entire life for an item known as <b>The</b> <b>Artifact,</b> a mysterious object whose purpose is equally mysterious. [...] He travels with a wizard known as Sparkles, and the duo seek to claim <b>The</b> <b>Artifact</b> and rid <b>the</b> land of evil. The story begins with <b>The</b> <b>Artifact</b> just out of DeathSpank's reach. Unable to claim it, he meets with a local witch, who promises to help him in exchange for his services. [...] He provides her with her requested items, and eventually obtains <b>The</b> <b>Artifact.</b>|$|R
50|$|The crew tracks {{down the}} signal and comes across an alien <b>artifact.</b> Suddenly, <b>the</b> <b>artifact</b> flashes {{with a bright}} light. If {{one or more of}} the Iktomi's crew is dead, <b>the</b> <b>artifact's</b> energy release {{seemingly}} kills everyone. One of the crew manages to survive long enough to send a distress call, which <b>the</b> <b>artifact</b> sends back in time, creating a causal loop. However, if all of the crew survive, then one of the crew members manages to pick up a rock and throw it at <b>the</b> <b>artifact,</b> destroying it in a massive explosion, with their ultimate fate unknown.|$|R
25|$|The {{team had}} {{three minutes to}} {{retrieve}} <b>the</b> <b>artifact</b> and leave <b>the</b> temple with it. If either contestant grabbed <b>the</b> <b>artifact,</b> all remaining temple guards vanished and all locked doors in the temple instantly opened, allowing the contestant to escape unhindered. For entering the temple, the team automatically won a prize. If a team member picked up <b>the</b> <b>artifact,</b> <b>the</b> team won a more expensive prize as well. A team that retrieved <b>the</b> <b>artifact</b> and exited <b>the</b> temple with it before time ran out earned the grand prize, {{in addition to the}} other two prizes. Starting with season 2, the temple had an actual gate that Olmec would lower before the round started.|$|R
5|$|Greek {{influence}}, {{which had}} {{made its way}} to Phoenicia during the Persian period, now became stronger. Figurines found in Kharayeb show Aegean influence on local craftsmen. This spreading Hellenization interacted with the local Semitic population substratum, which remained faithful to its gods and its language. It resulted in an artistic and architectural symbiosis best illustrated in <b>the</b> <b>artifacts</b> of Umm el 'Amed and Bustan esh Sheikh.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, {{historian}} Herbert Eugene Bolton identified an area along Garcitas Creek, near Matagorda Bay, as {{the location}} of Fort St. Louis. Other historians, before and after Bolton, argued that the fort was located on Lavaca River in Jackson County. Five decades later, the University of Texas at Austin funded a partial excavation of Bolton's site, {{a part of the}} Keeran ranch. Although several thousand items were recovered, archaeologists could not accurately distinguish between French and Spanish artifacts of the 17th century, and no report on the findings was ever issued. In the 1970s, <b>the</b> <b>artifacts</b> were reexamined by Kathleen Gilmore, an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University. She determined that while most of <b>the</b> <b>artifacts</b> were Spanish, some definitively matched artifacts recovered from French and French-Canadian excavations of the same time period.|$|E
5|$|Tell Brak was {{excavated}} by the British archaeologist Sir Max Mallowan, {{husband of}} Agatha Christie, in 1937 and 1938. <b>The</b> <b>artifacts</b> from Mallowan's excavations are now {{preserved in the}} Ashmolean Museum, National Museum of Aleppo and the British Museum's collection; the latter contain the Tell Brak Head dating to c. 3500–3300 BC.|$|E
50|$|When Tosh {{returns to}} Mary, she reveals {{herself as an}} alien, an exiled dissident, and that <b>the</b> <b>artifact</b> is a {{transporter}} that can help her to leave the planet. Tosh offers Torchwood's services to Mary, but she refuses, and instead asks Tosh {{to take her to}} Torchwood so she can retrieve <b>the</b> <b>artifact</b> herself. At <b>the</b> Hub, they find that Jack has deduced that Mary is an alien and the murderer of the skeleton and others through the century. Jack explains that <b>the</b> <b>artifact</b> is a transporter for a guard and a prisoner; when <b>the</b> <b>artifact</b> first arrived in Cardiff in 1812, Mary was able to kill her guard and took the body of a human woman, killing others to keep her human form. Mary holds Tosh at knife point, demanding <b>the</b> <b>artifact.</b> Jack, now aware of Tosh's telepathic abilities, instruct Tosh to remain still as he makes the trade with Mary. As soon as Mary takes <b>the</b> <b>artifact,</b> she and it disappear; Jack explains he programmed the device to transport her directly {{to the center of the}} sun.|$|R
50|$|Monkhouse tells Burrows <b>the</b> <b>artifact</b> {{was made}} by an ancient technologically {{advanced}} race, <b>the</b> Steltek. <b>The</b> <b>artifact</b> is half of a map; Monkhouse has the rest. Burrows agrees to explore {{the area in the}} map.|$|R
5000|$|In this context, {{the term}} [...] "virtualization" [...] refers to <b>the</b> <b>artifact</b> being {{encapsulated}} (application), {{which is quite}} different from its meaning in hardware virtualization, where it refers to <b>the</b> <b>artifact</b> being abstracted (physical hardware).|$|R
5|$|Eventually accumulating all <b>the</b> <b>artifacts,</b> the Raiders {{discover}} that the Moebius Foundation is a front for the heir apparent of the Dominion, Valerian Mengsk; though the Hyperion crew is concerned about having been working for their enemy, Valerian coaxes Raynor to accompany him in invading Char as the combined artifact may reverse Kerrigan's infestation. Although the Dominion takes heavy losses to the Zerg, the Raiders defend the artifact from Kerrigan until it can be activated; upon detonating, it destroys all nearby Zerg and leaves Kerrigan human again. However, Findlay, acting on orders from Arcturus Mengsk, attempts to kill the weakened Kerrigan, forcing Raynor to kill Findlay before tending to Kerrigan.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{developments}} for the Sampaloc campus are ongoing. The Plaza Mayor {{in front}} the Main Building, {{together with the}} Quadricentennial Square which will feature the Tetraglobal sculpture, the Quadricentennial Fountain, and the Quadricentennial Alumni Walkway were constructed in 2006. To accommodate the needs of extra space for {{the growing number of}} student activities, the UST Tan Yan Kee Student Center was built in front of the Miguel de Benavides Library. The more-than-80-year-old Main Building, and <b>the</b> <b>artifacts</b> and art works in the UST Museum of Arts and Sciences were recently placed under the preservation of the UST Heritage Conservation program in December 2008.|$|E
5|$|Seibal {{was first}} settled around 900 BC in the Preclassic Period. It {{reached its peak}} {{population}} in the Late Preclassic around 200 BC, {{at the end of}} the Cantuse ceramic phase (300-200 CE). Ceramics from the deep Middle Preclassic levels at Seibal belong to the little-known Real/Xe phase, found in the western Petén region. A cruciform Olmec-style cache consisting of a bloodletter and jade celts is similar to those found in the Olmec heartland on the Gulf Coast of Mexico, and <b>the</b> <b>artifacts</b> were probably manufactured at La Venta. This cache dates to approximately 900 BC.|$|E

5|$|As of {{that time}} and in the {{following}} decades, Western Pomerania, plus some of Greater Poland, Lower Silesia and some areas west of the middle and lower Oder River made up the Sukow-Dziedzice culture group. Its origin {{is the subject of}} debate among archeologists. First settlements appear in the early 6th century and cannot be directly derived from any other Slavic archeological culture. They reveal certain similarities to <b>the</b> <b>artifacts</b> of the Dobrodzień group of the Przeworsk culture. According to scholars such as Siedow, Kurnatowska and Brzostowicz, it might be a direct continuation of the Przeworsk tradition. According to allochthonists, it represents a variant of the Prague culture and is considered its younger stage. The Sukow-Dziedzice group shows significant idiosyncrasies, such as no graves and (typical {{for the rest of the}} Slavic world) rectangular dwellings set partially below the ground level were found within its span.|$|E
