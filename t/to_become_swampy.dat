50|$|In 1902, the President of the Emery Stake, Reuben C. Miller, {{sent the}} bishopric of Ferron {{to select a}} {{permanent}} spot for the town of Kingsville. There were two candidate locations: the homesteads and the Westingkow farm 2 mi west of that. The bishop decided it should be near the Westingkow farm because {{the lay of the}} land suggested that the old location could <b>become</b> <b>swampy.</b> Although the settlers initially disagreed, they consented, purchased the Westingkow farm, and moved their log cabins two miles to the west.|$|R
50|$|North of Stocking Stream, {{the wide}} flat valley floor <b>becomes</b> <b>swampy</b> {{and the track}} {{continues}} on a wooden boardwalk before it reaches {{the last of the}} suspension bridges. The track crosses Hooker River a third time, just below the moraine walls of Hooker Lake. A short track leads off the main path to small tarn, before the track skirts around the moraine wall as it climbs gently to the height of the moraine wall, reaching a lookout point with picnic tables, overlooking the proglacial Hooker Lake. From the lookout, a small path leads down to the shore of the lake.|$|R
50|$|The Finnish word kluuvi and the Swedish word glo mean a gloe lake - a bay that {{is closed}} up or closing up. The {{district}} was originally a bay in the Gulf of Finland, which eventually <b>became</b> <b>swampy.</b> The bay was {{filled in the}} middle of the 19th century. The odour of rotting seaweed and other plants can still be smelled near construction sites. The Helsinki Metro construction found a kluuvi in the district, when it turned out the planned site for a metro tunnel was supposed to go didn't have a solid rock base. The soft ground had to be artificially frozen before it was possible to dig through it to construct a solid base for the metro track.|$|R
2500|$|The {{ground between}} Polygon Wood and the Menin road {{contained}} the Polygonbeek, between Reutel and Cameron Covert and the Reutelbeek, which drained the south-eastern {{corner of the}} Gheluvelt Plateau. The beds of the streams had been smashed by shellfire and their courses had <b>become</b> <b>swampy</b> and in wet weather formed a mud slough about [...] wide between Reutel {{to the north and}} Cameron Covert Polderhoek Spur to the south. A ravine between the Polygonbeek and Jetty Warren was muddy but passable in most places. The fresh 45th Reserve Division, the Eingreif division of Gruppe Ypern contributed Reserve Infantry Regiment 210 (RIR 210) and the 8th Division of Gruppe Wijtshate supplied Infantry Regiment 93 (IR 93). The 4th Army Sturmbataillon provided twelve sections to attack the pillboxes and several minenwerfer companies were attached, to form a special force under General , the 17th Division commander.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{vascular}} plants {{observed in}} the area were composed {{of a total of}} 184 taxa; 74 families, 141 genus, 168 species, 10 varieties, 4 breeds and 2 sub-species. The only rare or endangered species found in the area was Phelloterus Littoralis Bentham. The four endemic plants were found growing in the area like Athyrium koryoense, Carex kobomugi Ohwi, Lespedeza maximowiczii var. elongata NAKAI and Weigela subsessilis L. H. Bailey. Specialized plants of Yeondo were a total of 48 species; 36 taxa in Grade I, 2 taxa in Grade II and 10 taxa in Grade III. There was no species in Grade IV and V. The attach of naturalized plants is slow because the island has fewer number of tourists and visitors than other islands. Temperate evergreen plants grow on rocky areas and cliffs on Yeondo, so constant monitoring is needed. The measures should be taken to protect the plants from the development. As abandoned paddy fields or fallow fields <b>become</b> <b>swampy,</b> {{there are a variety of}} aquatic plants growing. In the respect, a conservation measure are needed...|$|R

In the late 1940s, Jungle Gardens was sold to the philanthropic Allyn family, who continue to manage it.|$|R
60|$|That evening, indeed, {{the women}} began to arrive, {{and said that}} they {{believed}} all would be in on the following day. Among them was Boduoc's mother, who told Beric that her eldest daughter had started with Berenice and Cneius to meet the Romans as soon as the news of the defeat reached them. When day broke, Beric's command, with the women who had arrived, set off laden with as much grain in baskets or cloths as they could carry, and driving the cattle and pigs before them. The country soon <b>became</b> <b>swampy,</b> but their guide knew the ground well, and by a winding path led them dry footed through the bushes, though they could see water among the roots and grass on either side of them. They had, however, great difficulty with the cattle and pigs, but after several attempts to break away, and being nearly lost in the swamps, from which many of them had to be dragged out by sheer force, the whole reached the river. The men of the rear guard in charge of {{the main body of the}} swine and cattle did not arrive there until midday.|$|R

50|$|The volcano has a 300-400 m {{diameter}} crater surrounded {{on three}} sides by a 6-8 m high semi-circular tuff ring with steep inner slopes and gentler outer slopes. In places {{the crest of the}} tuff ring has been flattened off by bulldozing during subdivision in the 1990s. The tuff ring is breached to the north-east, presumably by the sea during the Last Interglacial warm period, about 130,000 years ago, when the sea level was 5-6 m above the present. The present floor of the crater is about 5 m above present high tide level and slopes down to the edge of Harania Creek estuary on the Manukau Harbour. After eruption, Boggust Crater would have become a freshwater lake, before it was breached by the sea <b>to</b> <b>become</b> an intertidal lagoon for a few thousand years, rather like Panmure Basin today. The sea level dropped about 120,000 years ago and the crater <b>became</b> a <b>swampy</b> depression until 1 m of fill was added and drainage installed to make it a recreational sports field.|$|R

Before crossing these, at Wilcox’s suggestion they each cut down a bush and beat the water with it.|$|R
50|$|At {{one time}} Amazon River flowed westward, perhaps {{as part of}} a proto-Congo (Zaïre) river system from the {{interior}} of present-day Africa when the continents were joined as part of western Gondwana. Fifteen million years ago, the Andes were formed by the collision of the South American Plate with the Nazca Plate (eastern Pacific oceanic) plate. The rise of the Andes and the linkage of the Brazilian and Guyana bedrock shields, blocked the river and caused the Amazon <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a vast inland sea. Gradually this inland sea <b>became</b> a massive <b>swampy,</b> freshwater lake and the marine inhabitants adapted to life in freshwater. For example, over 20 species of stingray, most closely related to those found in the Pacific Ocean, can be found today in the fresh waters of the Amazon.|$|R

Fifteen million years ago, the main tectonic uplift phase of the Andean chain started. This tectonic movement is caused by the subduction of the Nazca Plate underneath the South American Plate.

50|$|Paleontology in Virginia {{refers to}} paleontological {{research}} occurring within or conducted by {{people from the}} U.S. state of Virginia. The geologic column in Virginia spans from the Cambrian to the Quaternary. During {{the early part of}} the Paleozoic, Virginia was covered by a warm shallow sea. This sea would come to be inhabited by creatures like brachiopods, bryozoans, corals, and nautiloids. The state was briefly out of the sea during the Ordovician, but by the Silurian was once gain submerged. During this second period of inundation the state was home to brachiopods, trilobites and entire reef systems.
