5|$|Musker and Clements created <b>the</b> <b>Genie</b> with Robin Williams in mind; {{even though}} Katzenberg {{suggested}} actors such as John Candy, Steve Martin, and Eddie Murphy, Williams was approached and eventually accepted the role.

Unusually for an animated film, much of Williams' dialogue was ad-libbed: for some scenes, Williams was given topics and dialogue suggestions, but allowed to improvise his lines. It was estimated that Williams improvised 52 characters. Eric Goldberg, the supervising animator for <b>the</b> <b>Genie,</b> then reviewed Williams' recorded dialogue and selected the best gags and lines that his crew would create character animation to match.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{completion}} of Age of Empires, Ensemble Studios had {{signed a contract with}} Microsoft for a sequel. The design team chose to set The Age of Kings in the Middle Ages as a logical progression from the ancient era setting of Age of Empires. The design team was conscious of attempting to capture the broad appeal of the first game without making the game's design too similar. Nonetheless, they attempted to appeal to the vast demographic who played Age of Empires. The Age of Kingss design team intended to complete the game within a year by using code from the original and reusing <b>the</b> <b>Genie</b> game engine. Several months into the process they found they {{would not be able to}} complete a game of the quality they sought in that time. Ensemble Studios informed Microsoft they would need another year and instead created , an easily developed expansion pack of Age of Empires, as a compromise which could be released for Christmas 1998. To help meet the next year's deadline, additional programmers, artists, and designers were employed. To overcome another significant objection to Age of Empires—that of path finding—the team completely redesigned the game engine's movement system.|$|E
