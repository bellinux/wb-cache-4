5|$|At {{around the}} time Batch's {{squadron}} was working up for the summer cruise, Henry Abbott, the German consul in Salonika, then in the Ottoman Empire, was murdered. Further attacks on German citizens living in the area were feared, and so Batsch was ordered to sail to the Mediterranean Sea to stage a naval demonstration in June 1876. After arriving with the four ironclads, he was reinforced by three unarmored vessels. After <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> subsided in August, Batsch departed with Kaiser and Deutschland; the other two ironclads remained in the Mediterranean {{for the rest of}} the summer.|$|E
5|$|Common to all {{crimes against}} {{the person is}} the {{infringement}} {{of the right to}} bodily integrity. It extends to the touching of clothing, for example, and where no physical harm actually results. However, if all touchings were criminalised, this would interfere with the right to liberty. It is the very touching, and not the harm, that is the violation of principle. This is related to the right to privacy under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The central statute on this topic is Offences against the Person Act 1861, which brought together a multitude of difference offences, with much overlap and inconsistent terminology. These include both the actual infliction and <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence.</b> Although criticised, the Act has not been replaced.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{violence}} of the suppression, the government and local lords were relatively circumspect in restoring order after the revolt, and continued to be worried about fresh revolts for several decades. Few lords took revenge on their peasants except through the legal processes of the courts. Low-level unrest continued for several more years. In September 1382 there was trouble in Norfolk, involving an apparent plot against the Bishop of Norwich, and in March the following year there was an investigation into a plot to kill the sheriff of Devon. When negotiating rents with their landlords, peasants alluded to the memory of the revolt and <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence.</b>|$|E

25|$|Many of the Mexicans {{who were}} native {{to what would}} become a state within the United States were {{experienced}} miners, and they had great success mining gold in California.

Between 1848 and 1860, white Americans lynched at least 163 Mexicans in California alone. On July 5, 1851, a mob in Downieville, California, lynched a Mexican woman named Josefa Segovia. She was accused of killing a white man who had attempted to assault her after breaking into her home.|$|E

25|$|Ristovski also {{intended}} {{the film to}} portray social conditions in post-independence Macedonia, depicting it as a society plagued by anomie, violence and corruption. He saw these conditions {{as part of a}} larger regional unease whose history included civil conflict in former Yugoslav territories. Critics have similarly interpreted the film as an allegory of these social and regional concerns. In this context, Marko's transition from victimhood to criminality embodies the cycle of violence endemic in such conditions, while his failed hopes serve as a cautionary warning against the dangers of empty idealism in such situations. One critic saw Paris' bullet in Marko's chess set (see figure on the right) as a metaphor for <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> ever-present in their world.|$|E
25|$|The {{spring of}} 1870 saw Fort Edmonton come under <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> {{due to a}} war between the Blackfoot and Cree, {{resulting}} from the slaying of Cree Chief Maskipiton. The Blackfoot were unable to ford the North Saskatchewan due to the high spring waters, but they encamped across from Fort Edmonton and harassed it with their muskets nonetheless. Some wagons full of goods had to be abandoned by traders {{in a hurry to}} reach safety inside of the fort, and their contents were spoiled by the Blackfoot. Though the fort itself was not invaded, the men within were armed and ready to fight. Chief Factor William J. Christie chose to withstand the Blackfoot and not attack them, fearing that to do so would only invite further violence against the Hudson's Bay Company.|$|E
25|$|The Coptic Church {{has grown}} {{in recent years in}} Libya, due to the growing {{immigration}} of Egyptian Copts to Libya. As all followers of Christianity in Libya are foreigners who came to the country under work permits. There are an estimated 40,000 Roman Catholics in Libya who are served by two Bishops, one in Tripoli (serving the Italian community) and one in Benghazi (serving the Maltese community). There is also a small Anglican community, made up mostly of African immigrant workers in Tripoli; {{it is part of the}} Anglican Diocese of Egypt. People have been arrested on suspicion of being Christian missionaries, as proselytising is illegal. Christians have also faced <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> from radical Islamists in some parts of the country, with a well-publicised video released by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in February 2015 depicting the mass beheading of Christian Copts.|$|E

25|$|In tiny villages {{where there}} was no {{permanent}} Nazi military presence, such as Dąbrowa Rzeczycka, Kępa Rzeczycka and Wola Rzeczycka near Stalowa Wola, some Jews were able to openly participate in the lives of their communities. Olga Lilien, recalling her wartime experience in the 2000 book To Save a Life: Stories of Holocaust Rescue, was sheltered by a Polish family in a village near Tarnobrzeg, where she survived the war despite the posting of a 200 deutsche mark reward by the Nazi occupiers for information on Jews in hiding. Chava Grinberg-Brown from Gmina Wiskitki recalled in a postwar interview that some farmers used <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> against a fellow villager who intimated the desire to betray her safety.

500|$|Like many of Müller's books, The Land of Green Plums {{illustrates}} {{the position of}} dissidents from the German minority in Romania, who suffered a double oppression under the regime of Nicolae Ceauşescu. The rural German-speaking community tries to preserve its culture by enforcing traditional rules; once the main characters escape this environment through university study in the city, they suffer, as political dissidents, the oppression exercised by the totalitarian regime. Those who flee the country for Germany become [...] cultural outcasts: they are not considered German there but rather Eastern Europeans. Critics read the novel as testifying to abuse and the ensuing trauma. Normal human relationships are rendered impossible {{by the lack of}} freedom of expression; <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence,</b> imprisonment, and execution; and the possibility that any personal friend may be a traitor. Written in a paratactic style, full of flashbacks and time shifts, the language of the book reflects trauma and political oppression.|$|E

The Wall Street Journal felt similarly, writing that the song [...] "has sweep and drama, [...] orchestral support [...] gives it a classical timelessness that sets it apart from typical pop songs. Because it is a theme for a Bond film, after all, the song is also shot through with <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> and death". E!

[...] The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the song [...] "instantly feels like a Bond theme, with the singer's sultry voice set against a minor chord progression. Done in big, orchestral style, the mood – like the singer – is all 1960s throwback, back when Bond themes like 'Goldfinger' were smooth, seductive and larger than life".|$|E

Miriam Hopkins's coquettish [...] bar singer, Ivy Pierson, sexually teases Jekyll early in the film by displaying parts of her legs and bosom. Joy felt the scene had been [...] "dragged in simply to titillate the audience." [...] Hyde coerces her with <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> into becoming his paramour and beats her when she attempts to stop seeing him. She is contrasted with his wholesome fiancée Muriel (Rose Hobart), whose chaste nature dissatisfies March's baser alter ego.

Sex was intimately tied to horror in many pre-Code horror movies.
