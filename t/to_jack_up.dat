5000|$|Although some {{courts have}} on {{occasion}} adopted a more restrictive approach, {{the decision of}} the Lords in Jolley v Sutton London Borough Council, suggests that the liberal approach is to be preferred. The council allowed an abandoned boat to remain on its land and, over a period of time, two boys began to paint and repair it. Unfortunately, the boat fell on one of the boys, seriously injuring him. The claimant's case was that the boat represented a trap or allurement. The council accepted that it had been negligent in not removing the boat but that it had not been foreseeable that two boys would try <b>to</b> <b>jack</b> <b>up</b> the boat and so move it from the cradle upon which it lay. Lords Steyn and Hoffman stated that {{it is not necessary to}} foresee the precise injury that occurred, but injury of a given description. [...] "The foreseeability is not as to the particulars but the genus. And the description is formulated by reference to the nature of the risk that ought to have been foreseen." [...] (at para 37) So, in Hughes it was foreseeable that a child might be injured by falling in the hole or being burned by a lamp or by a combination of both. Although the injuries were not actually sustained in a foreseeable way, the injuries that actually materialised fell within the predictable range. Thus, the Wagon Mound No.2 and Hughes are compatible. The former alleged that damage by burning was not damage of a description that could reasonably have been foreseen, while the latter asserted that the injury was not reasonably foreseeable. In both cases, the claimants could recover damages.|$|E
5000|$|A {{part of the}} James A. Roberts {{design for}} the {{original}} Bull Ring Shopping Centre included a 12 storey circular office block. This was revised to 25 storeys, abandoning plans for a rooftop restaurant and a cinema. The design was approved and construction began on the 81 metre (265 ft) building in 1961. It was constructed with aid of a tower crane located {{to the side of}} the reinforced concrete central core. Due to its proximity to a railway tunnel, the main load was built on to a twin ring of piled foundations directly beneath the circular structural core. The floors are supported by the core and perimeter columns. When opened, the podium had shops and its own work of art, [...] "The Rotunda Relief" [...] at Lloyds banking hall, a circular mural designed by John Poole. [...] The building construction was unique at the time, possibly due to the lack of construction space, and was mostly built at ground floor level then 'jacked up' one floor at a time. This allowed the plant room and boiler house, located on the top floor, to have their equipment installed at ground level, making access easier than having to crane the equipment once the building was complete. The supports for the hydraulic pumps used <b>to</b> <b>jack</b> <b>up</b> the building started to shift towards the New Street Station railway lines so the building's planned height was never completed.Completed in 1965 as an office block at a cost of £1 million during the post-war rebuilding of the Bull Ring, it was initially much derided and considered a [...] "dead building".

40|$|Is {{the concept}} of aid on the way out? It could be smarter for {{agriculture}} to encourage inward investment. Like a customer checking a bag of beans for the merchant s added stones, many diplomats have a tool for checking the sincerity of policy statements at world conferences. It s called the 'Any new funds?' test, and is being used a lot at present. In the current series of world summits to eliminate poverty or halve hunger or boost agricultural research, there is usually a set of governmental and partnership promises to devote more resources to the target in question. Often such funds are neither new nor additional but are re-allocated or re-named existing funds. One frustrated ACP negotiator {{at a meeting in}} March 2002, held perhaps symbolically in an ill-lit and airless cellar room in New York, to set the agenda for the August 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) told Spore: 'Sometimes it s not even the old question of old wine in a new bottle. Sometimes they just change the label. ' The image of holding promises up to the scant light to see if they contain 'Any new funds?' is a sad reflection on the current state of international solidarity and self-interest. Everything is relative It s sad, but not fatal, this devaluation of international cooperation. Less than one-fifth of investment in most developing countries comes from outside. Contrary to many impressions, most investment comes from local financial and human capital. This is especially the case in agriculture and rural development which, if not fighting a losing battle, are witnessing an erosion of external funding. Recent World Bank figures show that expenditure on agriculture has shrunk from a quarter of the institution s budget to less than one-tenth. National inputs are barely more significant: few developing countries devote more than 10 % of their frail budgets to agriculture. In fact, as the FAO has recognised,'most investments are primarily mobilised by the farmers themselves'. Yet the sustained inability of the West to meet agreed aid targets is seen as a dire message for most ACP countries. They are used to outsourcing a small but determinant slice of their current expenditure and investment from foreign aid. That may need to change. Aid expenditure by the West has seldom done anything but shrink. In 2001, it sank to US$ 51. 4 billion (t 56. 8 billion). This represents 0. 22 % of the gross national income (GNI) of the West; ten years ago, it was 0. 33 %. The original 1970 s targets of 0. 7 % were, except for some northern European nations, truly fantastic. New promises were made at the UN Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey, Mexico, in March 2002. The United States pledged <b>to</b> <b>jack</b> <b>up</b> its aid budget by US$ 5 billion a year, of new funds, by the year 2006. European Union members made similar public promises. The net result: aid flows will rise to 0. 24 % of GNI. A pretty penny, but no more than that. The donors dilemma For donor nations, however, {{it is not just a}} question of bumping up aid budgets in the face of pressing domestic priorities and growing public resistance. If truth be told, and it is a truth any minister for finance or development will tell you in private, it is hard to properly disburse all aid funds. This leads to so-called underspends. There are organisational constraints in the way; hence the recent fads for capacity building. The donor s dilemma is to be accused either of apparently low aid pledges, or lack of focus in actual programmes: in brief, underwhelm or underspend. As it is, the aid community, official and non-governmental, is often accused of creating a parallel sector in a developing country s economy. It has its own infrastructures of education, transport, housing, priorities, grants, communications, personnel and human resource development strategies, all operating with scant regard for the sovereign state. This may, just may, buy quick results, but it scarcely enhances local development. Against this flaw-rich background, the classical practice of throwing money at a problem is not a real option to solve the needs of any sector, not even the neediest, such as agriculture. Recent talk of a Second Marshall Plan, for Africa, does not take account of the realities of insincere pledges from abroad and inadequate absorption capacity at home. The New Economic Partnership for African Development, with its emphasis on internal funding, is more realistic. Invest, invest Would development be better with less aid? Could well be so. Certainly, the alternatives seem to work better, if the playing field is level. Trade, not aid, as the 1964 slogan once said, can be more rewarding and enduring, on some tough conditions: fair trade, decent prices, realism about not exporting too much biomass too far, and abolition of insane subsidies to Western agriculture. The second alternative is direct foreign investment, already greater than all aid flows, public and private. Agriculture, however, is not rated as a sound investment, partly because income from volatile trading prices is uncertain. There are ample opportunities, nonetheless, to invest profitably in key points on the food chain: processing, packaging, distribution and marketing to name but a few. The smart farmer, farmers organisation, and research agency would all do well to target external investment, and not just aid funds, as a supplement to their own Herculean efforts. Existing experiences in micro-finance, savings, loans and insurance, can provide the basic financial skills which enable investment approaches. Making money work, instead of chasing money to make ends meet, is the next step for development finance. All it takes, really, is a new attitude.

40|$|Multiple {{strategic}} discontinuities of the {{constantly changing}} business environment are driving organizations, {{both large and}} small to seek new ways of conducting business to create wealth. The only way organizations can cope with these strategic discontinuities, in their pursuit of strategic self-renewal, is to develop and maintain strategic flexibility whereby new sources of wealth can be created through new combinations of resources. It is through such a strategic flexibility that any organization can endeavor to achieve a dynamic fit between the organization and its environment. Dynamic capabilities and their proxies are the means by which organizations can explore and exploit various resource configurations across different possible functional, cross-functional and cross-unit activities and thereby nurture their strategic flexibility in achieving this objective of strategic self-renewal, on a sustained basis. A critical literature review pertaining to resources, dynamic capabilities, competences and strategic renewal has pointed to a dearth of holistic quantitative studies of strategic renewal from a dynamic contingency perspective or a coevolutionary perspective, particularly in the Indian context. There has not been adequate literature in striking a blend of dynamic capabilities and their proxies in terms of a judicious mix of inside-out and outside-in approaches to strategy. The empirical and conceptual gaps in literature have provided us the impetus to take upon this study. On the conceptual front, there has not been any theoretical model of integrated resource leverage that links dynamic capabilities and their proxies, in the context of strategic renewal of organizations. On the empirical front, studies on dynamic capabilities till date have been predominantly qualitative anecdotal or episodic in nature and hence firm-specific or industry-specific in their outlook. It is imperative to synthesize the conceptual debates and the diverse empirical findings towards a more integrated understanding of resources and dynamic capabilities in the context of strategic self-renewal of organizations. The present study attempts to bridge these research gaps, first by developing a conceptual model and then testing it for subsequent statistical validation. It endeavors to understand the dynamics between different resource leverages and strategic renewal initiatives and their impact on organizational performance, on the dual fronts of market performance and financial performance. It also proposes a definitional framework encompassing the hierarchy of concepts viz., resources, dynamic capabilities and dynamic competences, whose definitions from the extant literature were duly synthesized for a greater and cohesive understanding of these concepts. The objectives of the current study were: •To compare and contrast the extent of implementation of various resource leverage practices and strategic renewal initiatives in different organizations of varying age, size and ownership. •To study the dynamic interactions between various resource leverages and strategic renewal initiatives and their impact on organizational performance. •To make appropriate suggestions for enhanced leverage of resources for augmented prospects of strategic renewal of organizations. A conceptual model was developed based on support from literature and a preliminary study. The model comprises several path links (hypotheses), each of which connects two variables (constructs with pertinent indicators) and their directionality. Besides establishing rationale for each of the hypotheses, the constructs were operationalized based on an existing survey instrument (Volberda, 1998) and other allied literature. All in all, a set of 38 hypotheses was identified and formulated for the current study and has been tested using Variance-Based Structural Equation Modeling (VBSEM). The conceptual model links three major aspects viz., strategic renewal initiatives, resource leverages and organizational performance. The resource leverages are the result of constant application and development of dynamic capabilities of an organization while the strategic renewal initiatives, by and large act as proxies of these dynamic capabilities. On one hand, the model focuses on different strategic renewal initiatives that tend <b>to</b> <b>jack</b> <b>up</b> the absorptive capacity of an organization from time to time, with critical inputs of information from the multiple perspectives of customers, employees, competitors and business environment in general. On the other hand, it encompasses multitudinous resource leverage practices that explore and exploit different resource configurations across various possible functional, cross-functional and cross-unit activities by virtue of dynamic capabilities. Thus, a blend of inside-out and outside-in approaches to strategy is captured in this model. Based on a critical literature review and a preliminary study entailing in-depth interviews with strategy experts and a pilot study, two complementary questionnaires were developed. The first questionnaire encompasses various resource leverage practices in terms of a firm’s dynamic capabilities, and it also includes measures of organizational performance while the second questionnaire entails strategic renewal initiatives in terms of proxies of dynamic capabilities. The first questionnaire was personally administered to the CEO while the second one to a senior level manager in each organization and their responses were garnered. The sample covered 80 multi-unit organizations (80 matched pairs of respondent executives). The first phase of data analysis comprised of computation of means and standard deviations and statistical tests of comparison for each item. Kruskal-Wallis test was used for each item, across different groups of organizations, based on age-wise, size-wise and ownership-wise modes of classification. Based on the results, i. e., wherever the results rejected the null hypothesis of the foregoing Kruskal-Wallis test, subsequently, multiple testing procedure entailing pair-wise t-tests (with Bonferroni p-value adjustment method) was adopted to further explore differences, if any, between different pairs of groups. Based on the statistical significance of these tests, conclusions were drawn as to whether nature of ownership, age and size of organizations can explain the variations in resource leverage practices, strategic renewal initiatives and firm performance across organizations. Next, the survey data were analyzed at an aggregate level to test the hypothesized conceptual model by means of a multivariate technique viz., Variance-Based Structural Equation Modeling (VBSEM). Our rationale for choosing VBSEM stems from various soft prerequisites of VBSEM such as minimal sample requirements, scope for flexible interplay of data and theory, least distributional assumptions (nonparametric approach), model complexity, theory-building and scope for accommodating both latent and emergent constructs in the model. In accordance with the recommendations of Falk and Miller (1992), model trimming was carried out based on widely accepted threshold values for loadings (for reflective indicators), path coefficients and Rvalues for endogenous constructs. In addition to this, formative indicators (at the outer model level) and exogenous constructs (independent LVs at the inner model level) were handled by duly checking for multicollinearity, using a holistic approach similar to forward stepwise regression proposed by A. Koutsoyuannis (1977) and which is a revised version of the Frisch’s Confluence Analysis. After obtaining PLS estimates for all the parameters, bootstrapping for 1000 resamples was carried out to obtain stable estimates for all these parameters of PLS. Thus, bootstrap estimates were found for all the parameters of PLS viz., weights for the formative indicators and loadings for the reflective indicators in the measurement model; and path coefficients in the structural model. Pertinent F-tests were used both for Rvalues and their respective effect sizes (f values) to test their statistical significance. Direct and indirect effects of exogenous variables on the endogenous variables in the structural model were computed. Besides these, Tenenhaus’ goodness-of-fit index for the overall model was computed and this was found to be adequate, given the complexity of the model. Concomitant to the foregoing quantitative analyses, three detailed case studies in manufacturing, service and process industries, one in each of these industries, were undertaken for the purpose of triangulation. All the three case studies were carried out and analyzed on a common theme viz., dynamic interactions between different resource leverages and strategic renewal initiatives and their impact on organizational performance. These case studies also represent three categories of ownership (one listed organization, one closely held organization and one Indian multinational) and three different age groups, and thereby provide sufficient contrast in contexts. Major conclusions of the study pointed to unexplored or under-explored or under-exploited resource leverage practices and strategic renewal initiatives in the Indian context. Some of the major ones include leverage of strategic alliances, leverage of IT, leverage of Product-Market Combinations (PMCs), modularity orientation in product design, inter-industry benchmarks, resource accumulation and resource conservation strategies in general. Based on these conclusions, appropriate suggestions were made. Major suggestions to organizations include exploration of new business opportunities via strategic alliances, exploration of white space opportunities via technological boundary-spanning activities, exploration of alternative business models in different product markets, augmentation of IT integration with business processes, enhancement of collective learning via cross-functional and cross-unit activities via practices such as job rotation and proper management of knowledge portals and increased encouragement to employees (particularly technological gatekeepers and entrepreneurial boundary-spanners) in all brainstorming sessions for generation of New Product Development (NPD) ideas. Major empirical contributions of this study include establishment of significance of different strategic variables in the Indian context, assessment of the dynamic interactions between various resource leverages and strategic renewal initiatives and their impact on organizational performance on the dual fronts of market performance and financial performance. Major conceptual contributions of this study comprise refinement, integration and operationalization of theoretical concepts drawn from the diverse yet complementary sources of literature such as resources, dynamic capabilities, competences and strategic renewal from a dynamic contingency perspective or a co-evolutionary perspective concomitant to development of a comprehensive model of integrated resource leverage via dynamic capabilities and their proxies for strategic self-renewal of multi-unit organizations Directions to future researchers include longitudinal studies for greater insights of causality in the model with feedback effects, empirical studies with multiple respondents per organization, inclusion of objective measures of performance or / and industry-specific studies with a larger sample size for gaining an enhanced understanding of resource leverage practices for strategic organizational renewal...|$|E

From the National Science Foundation (NSF).; This is a 2 -story structure with the "leading edge" facing the prevailing wind. The steel structure is elevated 10 -feet above the initial graded snow surface, supported by many 24 -inch heavywall pipe piles. These are designed to allow the structure <b>to</b> be <b>jacked</b> <b>up</b> in the future. Unlike the original elevated CAF, the jacking system {{was included in the}} design; it was even tested at the fabricator's shop before the material was shipped. In this conceptual view the ceremonial Pole is shown in the lower left corner, near a line of Pole survey markers...|$|R

Now you are an amateur kidnapper--a bright, lovable girl at whose approach people lock up their children {{and sit on the}} key. As for me, five years ago I was a heartless brute. Now I am a sober serious business-man, specially called in by your uncle <b>to</b> help <b>jack</b> <b>up</b> his tottering firm. Why not bury the dead past? Besides--I don't want to praise myself, I just want to call your attention to it--think what I have done for you. You admitted yourself that it was my influence that had revolutionised your character. But for me, you would now be doing worse than write poetry. You would be writing vers libre. I saved you from that. And you spurn me!" ...|$|R
