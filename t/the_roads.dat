5|$|<b>The</b> <b>roads</b> the Muisca {{merchants and}} xeques used to {{traverse}} the Altiplano and access surrounding areas, were dug {{in the top}} soil without pavement, making them hard to recognise in the archaeological record. <b>The</b> <b>roads</b> leading to the religious sites, such as Lake Tota, were marked with stones surrounding the pathway, which are still visible today. Cable bridges of vines and bamboo connected {{the banks of the}} many rivers of the Andes. <b>The</b> <b>roads</b> crossing the mountains of the Eastern Ranges were narrow, which created a problem for the Spanish conquistadors who used horses to travel long distances.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> safety has close {{relation}} to road alignment, and operation speed {{is the key}} factor of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> traffic safety. We should make an evaluation on the safety of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> alignment indexes after finishing the design of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> alignment to judge the reasonability of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> alignment indexes. This paper studies the traffic safety of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> alignment {{based on the idea}} of operation speed, evaluates the quality of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> alignment by <b>the</b> operation speed, make further improvement for <b>the</b> <b>road</b> alignment indexes, and test the rationality of this idea through engineering examples...|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> {{turns into}} a regular 1+1 road at Aaspere. For 6,3 kilometres, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> stays this way. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> turns into dual {{carriageway}} again at Haljala, with only one interchange (T1/T177/T24), staying it for only 2,8 kilometres. For 72,5 kilometres, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> is once again a 1+1 <b>road.</b> <b>The</b> <b>road</b> passes <b>the</b> first bigger town, Rakvere and near it intersects with the T5. Other notable intersections are with the T117 to Sonda and the T34 leading into Kiviõli. At Kohtla-Järve, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> is again a dual carriageway, staying like this for 11,8 kilometres. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> interchanges with <b>the</b> T93 on two occasions. At Jõhvi, a trumpet interchange leads to the T3. Shortly after this, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> {{turns into a}} 1+1 road, staying this way {{for the rest of}} <b>the</b> route. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> bypasses Sillamäe, a major port town. Shortly after this, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> intersects with <b>the</b> T91 leading to Narva-Jõesuu. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> reaches Narva and follows the path of Tallinna maantee. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> crosses <b>the</b> Narva river and ends at the Estonian-Russian border.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> {{network is}} one of the most {{important}} types of information on raster maps. In particular, <b>the</b> set of <b>road</b> intersection templates, which consists of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> intersection positions, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> connectivities, and <b>the</b> <b>road</b> orientations, represents an abstraction of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> network and is more accurate and easier to extract than the extraction of <b>the</b> entire <b>road</b> network. To extract <b>the</b> <b>road</b> intersection templates from raster maps, the thinning operator is commonly used to find the basic structure of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> lines (i. e., to extract the skeletons of the lines). However, the thinning operator produces distorted lines near line intersections, especially at the T-shaped intersections. Therefore, the extracted position of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> intersection and <b>the</b> <b>road</b> orientations are not accurate. In this paper, we utilize our previous work on automatically extracting road intersection positions to identify <b>the</b> <b>road</b> lines that intersect at the intersections and then trace <b>the</b> <b>road</b> orientations and refine the positions of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> intersections. We compare the proposed approach with the usage of the thinning operator and show that our proposed approach extracts more accurate road intersection positions and <b>road</b> orientations than <b>the</b> previous approach...|$|R

5|$|The race {{started at}} 14:00China Standard Time (UTC+8), and was {{scheduled}} to last until 17:30. The weather was unseasonably cool.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>roads</b> {{now making}} up the highway were {{originally}} part of several privately maintained turnpikes, which fostered settlements along the corridor. Once part of the former NY58, it has been NY32 since 1930. Only one of three letter-suffixed spur routes remains.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>roads</b> {{were just}} prairie trails which wound around bluffs, {{up and down}} hills. These roads were quite {{adequate}} for horses, but were a different story for cars; very few of <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> went on the square where <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> allowances were finally surveyed. When it rained {{there was always a}} mud puddle at the bottom of every hill and every car that went through made the ruts deeper and deeper until you were stuck. The coming of cars soon made a big difference. The prairie trails proved inadequate and road allowances were graded and built up; culverts had to be installed where the natural water runs were. The new graded roads were a big improvement but many a muddy mile was driven over the country roads. Gradually, some of the main highways would get some gravel and it was quite a pleasure to pull of a muddy country road on to a few miles of gravel—Les Moffatt.|$|E

5|$|A few of <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> {{surrounding}} {{the area that}} was Monte Ne {{on the edge of}} Beaver Lake have names reflecting what once was there.

Similarly Canal Street is nearby, named for the waterways that Harvey's gondolas once traveled. Other roads close by include Oklahoma Drive, Vinda Drive, and Monte Ne Estates Drive.|$|E
