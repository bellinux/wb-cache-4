40|$|Disordered {{optical fibers}} show novel waveguiding {{properties}} {{that can be}} used for various device applications, such as beam-multiplexed optical communications and endoscopic image transport. The strong <b>transverse</b> <b>scattering</b> from the transversely disordered optical fibers results in transversely confined beams that can freely propagate in the longitudinal direction, similar to conventional optical fibers, with the advantage that any point in the cross section of the fiber can be used for beam transport. For beam multiplexing and imaging applications, it is highly desirable to make the localized beam radius as small as possible. This requires large refractive index differences between the materials that define the random features in the disordered fiber. Here, disordered glass-air fibers are briefly reviewed, where randomly placed airholes in a glass matrix provide the sufficiently large refractive index difference of 0. 5 for strong random <b>transverse</b> <b>scattering.</b> The main future challenge for the fabrication of an optimally disordered glass-air fibers is to increase the fill-fraction of airholes to nearly 50 % for maximum beam confinement...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{multiple}} scatterings on {{the propagation of}} hard partonic jets in a dense nuclear medium is studied {{in the framework of}} deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) off a large nucleus. Power counting arguments based on the Glauber improved Soft-Collinear-Effective-Theory are used to identify the class of leading power corrections to the process of a single parton traversing the extended medium without emission. It turns out that the effect of longitudinal drag and diffusion (often referred to as straggling) is as important as <b>transverse</b> <b>scattering,</b> when relying solely on power counting arguments. With the inclusion of momentum exchanges in both transverse and longitudinal directions between the traversing hard parton and the constituents of the medium, we derive a differential equation for the time (or distance) evolution of the hard parton momentum distribution. Keeping up to the second order in a momentum gradient expansion, this equation describes in-medium evolution of hard jets which experience longitudinal drag and diffusion plus the transverse broadening caused by multiple scatterings from the medium.

In emission computations, the use of the far-zone condition overestimated the level of the brightness temperature.

40|$|Objectives. The aim of {{this work}} {{is to develop a}} {{mathematical}} tool for describing the scattering of radio signals by meteor trails associated with radio wave dispersion taking into account a range of extenuatory factors. Method The study was carried out using mathematical analysis in the application of meteorite radio wave reflection theory. Results The questions of the scattering of radio waves from undercompacted and overcompacted meteor trails, as measured by radio sounding in a continuous pulse mode, are considered separately. The mechanisms that influence the formation of the amplitude of the RF signal reflected from a meteor trail are discussed in detail. The obtained mathematical expressions enable the initial reflected signal amplitudes from undercompacted and overcompacted meteor trails to be evaluated for power capacity in the different operation modes of radio transmitting stations. Conclusion Following from the theory of the scattering of radiowaves by meteor trails, it is shown that the radiolocation calculation method for sounding meteor trails coincides with the existing theory. The results of the study may be useful for further development of transverse meteor wave propagation theory, especially for the theory of amplitude distribution reflection response.

40|$|I first review basic {{models for}} laser-plasma {{interaction}} that explain electron acceleration and beam confinement in plasma.

I then analyze the direct (a. k. a. linear) acceleration of an electron in infinite vacuum by a pulsed radially-polarized laser beam, consequently demonstrating the possibility of accelerating an initially-relativistic electron in vacuum {{without the use of}} ponderomotive forces or any optical devices to terminate the laser field. As the Lawson-Woodward theorem has sometimes been cited to discount the possibility of net energy transfer from a laser pulse to a relativistic particle via linear acceleration in unbounded vacuum, I derive an analytical expression (which I verify with numerical simulation results) defining the regime where the Lawson-Woodward theorem in fact allows for this. Finally, I propose a two-color laser-driven direct acceleration scheme in vacuum that can achieve electron acceleration exceeding 90 % of the one-color theoretical energy gain limit, over twice of what is possible with a one-color pulsed beam of equal total energy and pulse duration. by Liang Jie Wong.

40|$|Background: In {{radiation}} therapy with ion beams, lateral distributions of absorbed dose in the tissue are important. Heavy ion therapy, such as carbon-ion therapy, {{is a novel}} technique of high-precision external radiotherapy which has advantages over proton therapy in terms of dose locality and biological effectiveness. Methods: In this study, we used Monte Carlo method-based Geant 4 toolkit to simulate and calculate the effects of energy, shape and type of ion beams incident upon water on multiple scattering processes.

40|$|The {{field of}} hadron therapy is growing rapidly with several {{facilities}} currently being planned, under construction or in commissioning worldwide. In the “active scanning” irradiation technique, {{the target is}} irradiated using a narrow pencil beam that is scanned transversally over the target while the penetration depth is altered with the beam energy.

40|$|The {{magnetized}} induced Compton scattering off {{the particles}} of the ultrarelativistic electron-positron plasma of pulsar is considered. The main {{attention is paid}} to the transverse regime of the scattering, which holds in a moderately strong magnetic field. We specifically examine the problem on induced <b>transverse</b> <b>scattering</b> of the radio beam into the background, which takes place in the open field line tube of a pulsar. In this case, the radiation is predominantly scattered backwards and the scattered component may grow considerably. Based on this effect, we for the first time suggest a physical explanation of the interpulse emission observed in the profiles of some pulsars. Our model can naturally account for the peculiar spectral and polarization properties of the interpulses. Furthermore, it implies a specific connection of the interpulse to the main pulse, which may reveal itself in the consistent intensity fluctuations of the components at different timescales. Diverse observational manifestations of this connection, including the moding behavior of PSR B 1822 - 09, the peculiar temporal and frequency structure of the giant interpulses in the Crab pulsar, and the intrinsic phase correspondence of the subpulse patterns in the main pulse and the interpulse of PSR B 1702 - 19, are discussed in detail. It is also argued that the pulse-to-pulse fluctuations of the scattering efficiency may lead to strong variability of the interpulse, which is yet to be studied observationally. In particular, some pulsars may exhibit transient interpulses, i. e. the scattered component may be detectable only occasionally. Comment: 28 pages, 2 figures. Accepted for publication in Ap...|$|E
40|$|Of the cubic uranium pnictides, {{uranium nitride}} has the {{smallest}} U-U separation, the smallest magnetic moment (0. 75 µB) {{and the lowest}} Néel temperature (TN = 49. 6 ± 0. 3 K). It is of interest to know {{the nature of the}} excitation spectrum of UN to gain an understanding of the electronic structure of the uranium ion and of actinide ions in general. Such questions as whether the 5 f electrons are localized or itinerant for the metallic pnictides have not yet been answered. We report neutron inelastic scattering measurements at 4. 2 K from a single crystal of UN which reveal magnetic scattering that is weak in intensity and differs in symmetry and nature from the sharp, low-velocity, largely transverse spin waves of the 4 f cubic compounds. The magnetic response at the (110) magnetic reciprocal lattice point is a broad (FWHM = 5 ± 1 THz) distribution of intensity peaked at 4. 2 ± 0. 5 THz. Constant-frequency-transfer scans for ν between 2. 5 and 8. 0 THz show a single peak centred on the (110) point. The results indicate that UN possesses a steeply rising branch of excitations with an anisotropy gap. Measurements near (330) where the form factor is half that at (110) confirmed the magnetic character of the scattering. The symmetry of the magnetic response is primarily longitudinal. Intensity was observed where <b>transverse</b> <b>scattering</b> is anticipated, i. e. near (010), but the scattering was somewhat sharper in frequency and more than a factor two weaker than at (110). The transverse component at (110) is therefore less than 25 % of the observed response. The effect on the scattering near (110) of raising the temperature to 0. 8 TN is to enhance the low-frequency response strongly (by a factor of 4 at ν = 1. 5 THz) so as to give a broad distribution of inelastic scattering centred on ν = 0. At high frequencies this distribution is similar in form to the high-frequency part of the 4. 2 K distribution.

40|$|This thesis treats {{elastic wave}} {{scattering}} by cracks with interfacial forces. The results are of practical interest in ultrasonic testing and includes development of numerical {{methods used to}} predict such testing. First the canonical problem of two-dimensional (2 -D) diffraction from a semi-infinite crack is solved. The boundary conditions on the crack are the distributed spring boundary conditions. The solution includes integral transform techniques and scalar Wiener-Hopf calculations. Both the geometrical elastodynamic and the edge diffracted body waves are computed, the latter as high frequency approximations {{expressed in terms of}} diffraction coefficients. Similarly the diffraction coefficients for body-to-surface and surface-to-body waves are computed. Some of the quantities entering the solution are calculated numerically. The 2 -D diffraction coefficients for the distributed spring boundary conditions are implemented in the program PEDGE, which is a part of a program package from Nuclear Electric (Manchester, UK), formerly Central Electricity Generating Board. Several numerical calculations are performed for different realistic testing situations of finite, smooth and planar cracks. The boundary conditions allow a wide range of crack types and in particular a crack partially closed by a static background pressure is studied. A numerical comparison for the 2 -D horizontally polarized <b>transverse</b> <b>scattering</b> is made for a planar and a nonplanar crack. Here a numerical exact solution for the 2 -D scattering problem is obtained by use of the null field approach. The development of the null field solution also shows the importance of using the correct edge conditions. The Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (GTD) solution includes a multiply diffracted field, due to the interaction between the two cracktips, and this multiply diffracted field is shown to be of great importance. Generally the GTD solution yields accurate results even for quite low frequencies. In {{the last part of the}} thesis the full three-dimensional (3 -D) scattering problem of a plane wave from a semi-infinite crack with spring boundary conditions is solved.

40|$|Non-linear {{mechanisms}} arise {{frequently in}} plasmas and beam-plasma systems resulting in dynamics not predicted by linear theory. The non-linear mechanisms {{can influence the}} time evolution of plasma instabilities {{and can be used}} to describe their saturation. Furthermore time and space averaged non-linear fields generated by instabilities can lead to collisionless transport and plasma heating. In the case of beam-plasma systems counter-intuitive beam defocusing and scaling behavior which are interesting areas of study for both Low-Temperature and High Energy Density physics. The non-linear mode interactions in form of phase coupling can describe energy transfer to other modes and can be used to describe the saturation of plasma instabilities. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, a theoretical model was formulated to explain the saturation mechanism of Slab Electron Temperature Gradient (ETG) mode observed in the Columbia Linear Machine (CLM), based on experimental time-series data collected through probe diagnostics [1]. ETG modes are considered to be a major player in the unexplained high levels of electron transport observed in tokamak fusion experiments and the saturation mechanism of these modes is still an active area of investigation. The data in the frequency space indicated phase coupling between 3 modes, through a higher order spectral correlation coefficient known as bicoherence. The resulting model is similar to [2], which was a treatment for ITG modes observed in the CLM and correctly predicts the observed saturation level of the ETG turbulence. The scenario is further supported by the fact that the observed mode frequencies are in close alignment with those predicted theoretical dispersion relations. Non-linear effects arise frequently in beam-plasma systems and can be important for both low temperature plasma devices commonly used for material processing as well as High Energy Density applications relevant to inertial fusion. The non-linear time averaged fields generated by beam-plasma instabilities can be responsible for defocusing and distorting beams propagating in background plasma. This can be problematic in inertial fusion applications where the beam is intended to propagate ballistically as the background plasma neutralizes the beam space charge and current. We used particle-in-cell (PIC) code LSP to numerically investigate the defocusing effects in an ion beam propagating in background plasma experiences as it is exposed to the non-linear fields generated by Two-Stream instability between beam ions and plasma electrons. Supported by theory and benchmarked by the numerical solutions of governing E&M equations, the simulations were used to find and check scaling laws for the defocusing forces in the parameter space of beam and plasma density as well as the beam ion mass. A transition region where the defocusing fields peak has been identified, which should be avoided in the design of experimental devices. We further proposed a diagnostic tool to identify the presence of the two-stream instability in a system with parameters similar to the National Drift Compression Experiment II (NDCX-II) and conducted proof-of concept simulations. In the case of electron beam propagating in background plasma instability driven collisionless scattering and plasma heating is observed. 1 -D simulations conducted in EDIPIC were benchmarked in LSP to study the excitation and time-evolution of electron-electron Two-Stream instability. Coupling of electron dynamics via non-linear ponderomotive force created by instability generated fields with ion cavities and Ion-Acoustic mode excitation was observed. Furthermore 2 -D simulations of an electron-beam in a background plasma was performed. Many of the effects in observed in 1 -D simulations were replicated. Morever generation of oblique modes with transverse wave numbers were observed in the simulations, which resulted in significant <b>transverse</b> <b>scattering</b> of beam electrons and the time evolution of the turbulent spectrum was studied via Fourier techniques. It is plausible that the modes excited might be interacting non-linearly via mode-coupling, however further theoretical and numerical investigation of the turbulent spectrum is needed. The study of the more realistic 2 -D system and the spectrum is important for the understanding of collisionless heating of plasmas by beams and the underlying energy delivery which can have important applications in especially low temperature plasma systems used primarily in etching and materials processing...|$|E
40|$|Dilute {{magnetic}} semiconductors (DMS) can {{be tailored}} by doping {{a small amount}} of elements containing a magnetic moment into host semiconductors, which leads to a new class of semiconductors with the functionality of tunable magnetic properties. Recently, oxide semiconductors have attained interests for the possibility of developing room temperature dilute magnetic semiconductors. However, a large number of conflicting results have pointed towards both an intrinsic and extrinsic origin for ferromagnetism. In earlier studies of oxides in relation to DMS, the controversy originated mainly from imprudent conclusions relying on measurements of macroscopic magnetic properties without careful structural studies of secondary phases in the materials under investigation. This thesis describes the results of experiments with a broad set of complementary tools to investigate the origin of ferromagnetism in anatase Co:TiO 2, which shows room temperature magnetism and an anomalous Hall effect (AHE). In previous work carried out in the NanoElectronics group, ferromagnetism and the AHE at room temperature were observed in anatase Co:TiO 2 thin films grown under oxygen poor conditions, while the remanence and coercivity disappear for films grown under oxygen rich conditions. We employed synchrotron based techniques, namely x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), which rely on the excitation of core-level electrons by soft x-rays. One of appealing features of these techniques for DMS studies is that they can provide element specific information on the electronic and magnetic properties of materials. Here, we focused on Co-derived electronic states. We observed a suppressed XAS multiplet structure due to Co 2 + ions at Co L-edges in oxygen poor samples, as compared to oxygen rich samples. This suppressed fine structure can be explained by a larger featureless Co metal contribution superimposed on the spectral features related to Co 2 + ions. A Co metal contribution is confirmed by XMCD measurements, which show a featureless dichroism spectrum characteristic of metallic Co. Both oxygen poor and oxygen rich Co:TiO 2 showed a similar featureless XMCD spectrum, with the circular dichroism effect being significantly weaker for the oxygen rich case. These findings show that measurements of XAS L-edges alone may confirm the presence of ionic species, but cannot rule out secondary phases that may not yield a discernable fingerprint. It can thus be concluded from the XAS/XMCD measurements that the Co distribution is heterogeneous for all Co:TiO 2 films, grown under oxygen rich as well as oxygen poor conditions. Co-heterogeniety, in the form of metallic clusters, is also confirmed by energy filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM). This means that metallic Co clusters are present in all the investigated films, and that they contribute to the ferromagnetism (as shown by XMCD) and AHE (as discussed below). We conclude that XMCD and EF-TEM are especially useful tools to check for heterogeneity in DMS research. Using XAS, we also observed clear charge transfer (CT) satellite peaks at Co L edges for the thickest (160 nm) oxygen poor films. The CT peaks {{can be explained by the}} interaction of Co (3 d) electrons with donor defect states in the band gap. It is known that Co segregates to defects sites, where it may form clusters. The observation that the CT peaks become stronger for thicker films, which exhibit a higher defect density resulting from the relief of strain, may be related to defect states that are more energetically close to and significantly hybridized with the Co(3 d) states. These findings also confirm that the electronic structure of Co ions is heterogeneous, related to defect states in Co:TiO 2 thin films. The introduction of a TiO 2 buffer layer at the substrate/film interface, intended to reduce strain in Co:TiO 2, leads to a dramatic change of magnetic and structural properties in Co:TiO 2. First, a reduction of the density of Co clusters and a more homogeneous Co distribution in the thin films are confirmed by XRD, AFM and EF-TEM measurements. Second, the AHE is suppressed. These results can be explained by a cluster-induced AHE, also taking into account the results from EF-TEM analysis which showed that the location at which Co clusters form is markedly different for films with/without buffer layer. For Co:TiO 2 films without buffer layer, Co clusters formed preferentially at the substrate/film interface give rise to an anomalous transverse Hall resistivity by polarizing nearby electrons. On the other hand, for Co:TiO 2 films without buffer layer, Co clusters where mainly observed at the surface, such that they are placed outside the current path and do not contribute to the associated <b>transverse</b> <b>scattering.</b> The very small value of the ratio of the anomalous Hall resistivity to the longitudinal resistivity (10 - 4) also confirms that the AHE originates from Co clusters, since Co clusters polarize only nearby electrons. Therefore, the presence of AHE cannot be considered as a definite test for carrier mediated magnetism in dilute magnetic semiconductors. We also observed that metallic impurity band conduction and ferromagnetism occur simultaneously in both types of Co:TiO 2 films, with and without a buffer layer. Since the metallic impurity band conduction is found to co-occur with ferromagnetism due to Co clusters, we can conclude that the phenomena of impurity band conduction and ferromagnetism are not related. Last, the spin polarization of the charge carriers in ultrathin anatase Co:TiO 2 layers is investigated by studying spin-polarized tunneling in a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) configuration. It is found that the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) and junction resistance of epitaxial LSMO/STO/Co magnetic tunnel junctions changes significantly upon the insertion of ultrathin layers of Co:TiO 2 at the STO/Co interface. The magnitude of the TMR decreases but remains negative, while the junction resistance increases strongly. This is consistent with an effectively insulating and paramagnetic Co:TiO 2 adding to the tunnel barrier, with the tunneling electrons originating mostly from the Co:TiO 2 /Co interface, and experiencing spin-flip scattering by paramagnetic Co in the Co:TiO 2...|$|E

The <b>scattering</b> efficiency of the two modes is of the same order of magnitude, which goes against the common belief that antisymmetric transverse modes are “dark. ” The analysis of the reconstructed hologram in the Fourier plane allows us to estimate the angular scattering pattern for both excited modes. In particular, the antisymmetric <b>transverse</b> mode <b>scatters</b> light mostly into one half-plane, demonstrating that the quasi-static approximation breaks down in nanodisk pairs even for an interparticle distance lower than λ/ 4. 1...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the TE (<b>Transverse</b> Electric) <b>scattering</b> {{problems}} by a perfectly conducting strip grating over a grounded two dielectric layers with edge boundary condition are analyzed {{by applying the}} FGMM (Fourier Galerkin Moment Method). For the TE scattering problem, the induced surface current density is expected to the zero value at both edges of the strip, then the induced surface current density on the strip is expanded {{in a series of}} the multiplication of the Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind and the functions of appropriate edge boundary condition. The numerical results shown the fast convergent solution and goo...|$|R

The forewings are dark fuscous, slightly bronzy tinged {{and with a}} slightly curved white line {{from the middle of}} the costa to the dorsum beyond the middle, as well as a <b>transverse</b> streak of <b>scattered</b> white irroration before the termen. The hindwings are dark bronzy fuscous, lighter towards the base.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} {{detailed}} polarized small-angle neutron scattering on cubic FeGe in magnetic fields applied either along (<b>transverse)</b> the <b>scattering</b> vector or parallel (longitudinal) to the neutron beam. The ($H,T$) phase diagrams for all principal axes contain a segmented $A$-phase region {{just below the}} onset of magnetic order. Hexagonal Bragg-spot patterns were observed across the entire $A$-phase region for the longitudinal geometry. Scattering intensity was observed {{in parts of the}} A phase for both scattering configurations. Only in a distinct pocket ($A_ 1 $) vanishing scattering intensity was found in the transverse geometry.

40|$|We {{study the}} near {{field to the}} far field {{evolution}} of spin angular momentum (SAM) density and the Poynting vector of the scattered waves from spherical scatterers. The results show that at the near field, the SAM density and the Poynting vector are dominated by their transverse components. While the former (transverse SAM) is independent of the helicity of the incident circular polarization state, the latter (transverse Poynting vector) depends upon the polarization state. It is further demonstrated that the magnitudes and the spatial extent of the transverse SAM and the transverse momentum components can be controllably enhanced by exploiting the interference of the transverse electric and <b>transverse</b> magnetic <b>scattering</b> modes...|$|R
40|$|We have {{presented}} a derivation of the asymptotic equations for <b>transverse</b> magnetic multiple <b>scattering</b> coefficients of an infinite grating of penetrable circular cylinders for obliquely incident plane electromagnetic waves. We have first deducted an “Ansatz” delineating the asymptotic {{behavior of the}} <b>transverse</b> magnetic multiple <b>scattering</b> coefficients associated with the most generalized condition of oblique incidence (Kavaklıoğlu, 2000) by exploiting Schlömilch series corresponding to the special circumstance that the grating spacing is {{much smaller than the}} wavelength of the incident electromagnetic radiation. The validity of the asymptotic equations for the aforementioned scattering coefficients has been verified by collating them with the Twersky's asymptotic equations at normal incidence. Besides, we have deduced the consequences that the asymptotic forms of the equations at oblique incidence acquired in this paper reduce to Twersky's asymptotic forms at normal incidence by expanding the generalized scattering coefficients at oblique incidence into an asymptotic series {{as a function of the}} ratio of the cylinder radius to the grating spacing...|$|R
40|$|Cross section {{ratios for}} deep-inelastic {{scattering}} from 14 N and 3 He {{with respect to}} 2 H have been measured by the HERMES experiment at DESY using a 27. 5 GeV positron beam. The data cover a range in the Bjorken scaling variable x between 0. 013 and 0. 65, while the negative squared four-momentum transfer Q 2 varies from 0. 5 to 15 GeV 2. The data are compared to measurements performed by NMC, E 665, and SLAC on 4 He and 12 C, and {{are found to be}} different for x&# 60; 0. 06 and Q 2 &# 60; 1. 5 GeV 2. The observed difference is attributed to an A-dependence of the ratio R=σL/σT of longitudinal to <b>transverse</b> deep-inelastic <b>scattering</b> cross sections at low x and low Q 2...|$|R
40|$|The relaxor {{ferroelectric}} PbMg_ 1 / 3 Ta_ 2 / 3 O_ 3 was {{studied by}} single-crystal neutron and synchrotron x-ray diffraction and its detailed atomic structure has been modeled {{in terms of}} static Pb-displacements {{that lead to the}} formation of polar nanoregions. Similar to {{the other members of the}} Pb-based relaxor family like PbMg_ 1 / 3 Nb_ 2 / 3 O_ 3 or PbZn_ 1 / 3 Nb_ 2 / 3 O_ 3 the diffuse scattering in the [H, 0, 0]/[0,K, 0] scattering plane has a butterfly-shape around the (h, 0, 0) Bragg reflections and is <b>transverse</b> to the <b>scattering</b> vector for (h,h, 0) peaks. In the [H,H, 0]/[0, 0,L] plane the diffuse scattering is elongated along the directions and is <b>transverse</b> to the <b>scattering</b> vector for (h,h,h) reflections. We find that a model consisting of correlated Pb-displacements along the -directions reproduces the main features of the diffuse scattering in PbMg_ 1 / 3 Ta_ 2 / 3 O_ 3 adequately when the correlation lengths between the Pb-ion displacement vectors are longest along the and and shortest along directions.
