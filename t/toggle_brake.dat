40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to design, test and deliver a final {{manufactured}} manual wheelchair brake that would {{not interfere with the}} propulsion path of the user or injure the hand of the user in any way. Existing brakes often interfere with the individual’s propulsion stroke and require frequent adjustments. Some brakes also cause injuries to the hands that could potentially be avoided with a tuck-away brake system. The MQP team first studied the forces involved in wheelchair propulsion and the stroke patterns of an individual using the wheelchair to create a set of functional requirements for the final design. Then, twelve conceptual designs were generated that addressed the gears, the spokes, the grips, the toggle bar, the mount, and the locking mechanism of the brake system. A design matrix was applied to determine the final three brake designs and engineering drawings were produced to assist with manufacturing process. The brakes that were manufactured were the Modified Quadra, the Bicycle Brake, and the Sliding <b>Toggle</b> <b>Brake.</b> The Modified Quadra was made up of five parts including the tube, the shaft, the handle, the brass cap, and the knurl brake. The Bicycle brake was composed of the support tube, the brake arm, and the mounting bracket. The components of the Sliding <b>Toggle</b> <b>brake</b> were the base tubes, the telescoping link, the brass-bearing link, the mount, and the modified handle for a four-bar <b>toggle</b> <b>brake.</b> Each manufactured brake was tested and evaluated according to the design specifications and recommendations were made according to analysis of the results and consultation with students and caregivers at the Massachusetts Hospital School. The recommendations made for the Modified Quandra indicated that the angle of the brake should be minimized in order to decrease the amount of friction to allow smoother motion of the braking mechanism. Recommendations for the bicycle brake involved the use of a larger brake caliper to allow for better gripping of the brake, as well as easier adjustment by the user. Recommendations made for the Sliding <b>Toggle</b> <b>brake</b> involved modification of the handle to allow for more stowage underneath the seat...|$|E
50|$|The paramotor, {{weighing}} from 45 to 90 pounds (20 to 40 kg) {{is supported}} by the pilot during takeoff. After a brief run (typically 10 feet or 3 metres) the wing lifts the motor and its harnessed pilot off the ground. After takeoff, the pilot gets into the seat and sits suspended beneath the inflated paraglider wing. Control is available using <b>brake</b> <b>toggles</b> for roll and a hand-held throttle for pitch.|$|R
5000|$|The pilot {{controls}} thrust via {{a hand-held}} throttle and steers using the paraglider's <b>brake</b> <b>toggles</b> similar to sport parachutists.Paramotor wings have evolved specifically {{for use with}} power, as compared with free flight 'paraglider' wings. Such wings are typically designed for a higher speed, and may incorporate a [...] "reflex" [...] profile to aid stability in pitch, an idea taken from hang gliders of the 1980s.The Parabatix Sky Racers is an air racing event using paramotors to race round pylons in front of spectators.|$|R
50|$|A powered {{paraglider}} differs from a powered parachute (PPC) primarily in size, power, control method, {{and number of}} occupants. Powered paragliders are smaller, use more efficient (but more difficult to manage) paraglider wings, and steer with <b>brake</b> <b>toggles</b> like sport parachutists. Powered parachutes typically use easier-to-manage but less efficient wings, have larger engines, steer with their feet, and {{may be able to}} take along passengers. There are exceptions; a growing number of powered parachutes use elliptical wings, some use hand controls, and many are light single seat aircraft that meet FAA Part 103 requirements.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The design, fabrication, and {{characterization}} of an electrothermally actuated lens scanner with bistable mechanical brakes, {{for the application}} of free-space board-to-board optical in-terconnects, are presented. An electrothermally actuated stepper motor is used to scan a 2. 8 -mm-diameter lens shuttle by a maxi-mum of ± 170 μm (± 1. 57 ◦ scanning angle). Bistable mechanical <b>brakes,</b> <b>toggled</b> with U-shaped thermal actuators, will grip and hold the lens shuttle in place while dissipating zero power. The minimum frictional braking force and maximum actuator force are both measured to be 0. 75 mN. A position sensing detector is used to accurately measure the dynamics of the stepper motor and lens system, from which we verify our analytical model. Long-term testing results and solutions are also presented. We demonstrate a robust 10 -Gb/s optical link capable of maintaining connection despite a board tilting of 0. 45 ◦ while dissipating zero power.

50|$|Changing gear {{with the}} Wilson box {{relied on the}} control of the brake bands that held each epicyclic's annulus in fixed position. The brake band to be {{selected}} was controlled by a rotating cam, moved by the gear shift lever. Only one band was engaged for each gear selection. This small lever could not provide enough power to engage and lock the brake band, thus the need for the pedal The actual movement of the brake bands was controlled by the 'toggle' mechanism, a distinctive feature of the Wilson design. When the pedal was pressed and released, a series or 'busbar' of finger-like levers were pressed upwards by a strong coil spring, against a series of light linkages or 'operating struts'. The position of each linkage was controlled by the gear selection camshaft. If the cam (for each gear) held the linkage in place, rather than allowing it to swing out of the way, the busbar finger would then press, via the operating strut, onto the <b>toggles</b> controlling the <b>brake</b> bands themselves. These toggles provided the additional leverage necessary to hold the brake band in place, under the force of the coil spring, until the pedal was next pressed. A further characteristic of the Wilson design was the use of self-adjusting nuts on each band, to compensate for wear. The action of engaging and disengaging each band was sufficient to advance the ratchet nuts and so adjust for wear by taking up any slack.|$|R
