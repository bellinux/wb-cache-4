The Convention also determines which country's laws are to be applied and provides for the recognition and enforcement of measures taken in one Contracting State in all the other Contracting States. The co-operation provisions of the Convention provide the basic framework for the exchange of information and the necessary degree of collaboration between administrative authorities in <b>the</b> <b>Contracting</b> <b>States.</b> Reflecting an ever-increasing emphasis {{on the need for}} international cooperation as an essential element in the success of these measures the Convention has a full chapter on cooperation consisting of eleven articles.|$|E

2500|$|The first scientifically {{recognised}} {{occurrence of}} a non-indigenous marine species being transported in ships water {{occurred in the}} North Sea in 1903, with the Asian phytoplankton Odontella appearing. The issue became more prevalent {{with the increase in}} shipping in the late 20th century and the issue was raised {{for the first time at}} the IMO in 1988. Following several years of development, the Convention was adopted by the International Maritime Organization in 2004. [...] To enter into force, the Convention required ratification by a minimum of 30 States, representing 35% of world merchant shipping tonnage, subject to which it would enter into force 12 months later. On 8th September 2016, Finland acceded to the Convention, bringing <b>the</b> <b>contracting</b> <b>states</b> to 52 and the combined tonnage of States to 35.14%. This triggered the applicability of the entry into force date of the Convention, which occurred on the 8th September 2017. Since Finland, a number of States have continued to accede, bringing the total as of 7th July 2017 to 59 contracting States, representing 65.18% of world merchant shipping tonnage.|$|E

Debugging deployed Smart Contracts is a difficult task since once deployed, the code cannot be reexecuted and inspecting a simple attribute is not easily possible because data is encoded. In this technical report, we present SmartInspect to address the lack of inspectability of a deployed contract. Our solution analyses <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> <b>state</b> by using decompilation techniques and a mirror-based architecture to represent the object responsible for interpreting <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> <b>state.</b> SmartInspect allows developers and also end-users of a contract to better visualize and understand <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> stored <b>state</b> without needing to redeploy, nor develop any ad-hoc code...|$|R

2500|$|The BIS was {{originally}} intended to facilitate reparations imposed on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles after World War I, and to act as the trustee for the German Government International Loan (Young Loan) that was floated in 1930. The need to establish a dedicated institution for this purpose was suggested in 1929 by the Young Committee, and was agreed to in August of that year at a conference at The Hague. [...] A charter for the bank was drafted at the International Bankers Conference at Baden-Baden in November, and its charter was adopted at a second Hague Conference on January 20, 1930. According to the charter, shares in the bank could be held by individuals and non-governmental entities. [...] However, the rights of voting and representation at the Bank’s General Meeting were to be exercised exclusively by the central banks {{of the countries in}} which the shares had been initially subscribed. The BIS was constituted as having corporate existence in Switzerland on the basis of an agreement with Switzerland acting as headquarters state for the bank. It also enjoyed certain immunities in <b>the</b> <b>contracting</b> <b>states</b> (Brussels Protocol 1936).|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} of the possibility of utilizing the potential energy of <b>the</b> <b>contracted</b> <b>state</b> of corn mitochondria to drive Ca + inorganic phosphate accumulation. Contraction was obtained with succinate or NADH oxidation. In the succinate experiments <b>the</b> mitochondria were <b>contracted</b> in buffered KCl layered over sucrose in centrifuge tubes and centrifuged down through distinct wash, reactive and isotope exchange layers. In the NADH experiments, ion accumulation was initiated upon exhaustion of the substrate. The results show that mitochondria in <b>the</b> <b>contracted</b> <b>state</b> will actively bind some 45 Ca, but no real accumulation occurs until inorganic phosphate is available. Substrate powered contraction in the presence of inorganic phosphate also provides a potential for accumulation upon subsequent reaction of the mitochondria with Ca. It is deducted that contraction is due to X∼I formation, to which Ca will bind. Subsequent reaction with inorganic phosphate produces CaX∼P, which is the transport moiety. When X∼P is formed first, Ca also reacts to produce CaX∼P. Hence it is immaterial which ion reacts first with <b>the</b> <b>contracted</b> <b>state.</b> Contraction is believed to result from the action of a mechanoenzyme, presumably I∼. The stability of CaX∼I must be low for the mitochondria swell very rapidly upon exhaustion of NADH or blocking of succinate oxidation by cyanide...|$|R
