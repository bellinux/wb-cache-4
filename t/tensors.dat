5|$|As it is {{constructed}} using <b>tensors,</b> general relativity exhibits general covariance: its laws—and further laws formulated within the general relativistic framework—take {{on the same}} form in all coordinate systems. Furthermore, the theory does not contain any invariant geometric background structures, i.e. it is background independent. It thus satisfies a more stringent general principle of relativity, namely that {{the laws of physics}} are the same for all observers. Locally, as expressed in the equivalence principle, spacetime is Minkowskian, and the laws of physics exhibit local Lorentz invariance.|$|E

But these are also of mathematical interest and of potential direct physical relevance in other roles {{than that of a}} mere restriction. There were speculative theories, (<b>tensors</b> and spinors have infinite counterparts in the expansors of Dirac and the expinors of Harish-Chandra) consistent with relativity and quantum mechanics, but they have found no proven physical application.

5|$|The first paper, {{written with}} Jordan and Kundt, is a {{treatise}} {{on how to}} characterize exact solutions to Einstein's field equations in a systematic way.

This work also includes the first definition and classification of pp-waves, a class of simple gravitational waves.|$|E

A distinction is made among (authentic) <b>tensor</b> densities, pseudotensor densities, even <b>tensor</b> densities and odd <b>tensor</b> densities.

Furthermore, vector spaces furnish an abstract, coordinate-free way of dealing with geometrical and physical objects such as <b>tensors.</b> This in turn allows the examination of local properties of manifolds by linearization techniques. Vector spaces may be generalized in several ways, leading to more advanced notions in geometry and abstract algebra.|$|E
