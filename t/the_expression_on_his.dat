500|$|The press {{coverage}} of the trial included the publication on day two, by The Sun, of a notorious close-up of a half-smiling Silcott, one that [...] "created a monster to stalk the nightmares of Middle England," [...] as journalist Kurt Barling put it. Silcott {{said he had been}} asleep in a police cell when it was taken; he said he was woken up, held in a corridor with his arms pinned against a wall and photographed, and that <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face was one of fear. Its publication constituted [...] "the most gross contempt," [...] according to the trial judge, Sir Derek Hodgson (1917â€“2002), speaking to David Rose in 1992. No action was taken against the newspaper.|$|E
60|$|Bosinney {{began to}} walk about, and Soames did not like <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face.|$|E
60|$|His voice {{died away}} abruptly. <b>The</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face changed. He smiled, {{and this time}} the effort was obvious.|$|E

60|$|Aunt Jane gave a scornful snort, {{and the man}} {{responded in}} a curious way. He winked slowly and laboriously, still {{retaining}} <b>the</b> solemn <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face.|$|R
60|$|As {{he looked}} around he noticed <b>the</b> {{significant}} <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> wife's face, for the girl already had turned towards the shelf where he kept the lately purchased map.|$|R
6000|$|From <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> {{face all}} hands {{understood}} that something unpleasant had occurred, and 'Lish Davis {{asked in a}} tone of anxiety: ...|$|E
60|$|When he {{returned}} his companions knew from <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face, before {{he made a}} report, that the mission had been successful.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Hunter was in {{his office}} when the {{partners}} arrived, and <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face was not such as to inspire courage.|$|E
60|$|In an easy-chair {{opposite}} to me my listener sat and listened {{for two hours}} every evening. I interested myself by watching and attempting to analyze <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face, but what these appeared to indicate made no difference in my remarks. I do not think he liked repetitions, but if I chose to tell a thing several times, I did so. He {{had no right to}} tell me that he had heard that before. Immunity from this remark was to me a rare enjoyment.|$|R
60|$|But already <b>the</b> tense <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> {{face had}} gone. He drew {{himself up to}} his full height once more and heaved a deep breath which sounded like a sigh of satisfaction.|$|R
60|$|Dave {{faced the}} {{storekeeper}} with unflinching eyes, and Asa Dickley {{was compelled to}} look the youth over carefully. As he did this <b>the</b> positive <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face gradually changed to one of doubt.|$|R
60|$|He {{broke off}} {{suddenly}} and regarded Martin. Then, with {{a flash of}} divination, he saw the situation. <b>The</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face turned to wondering horror.|$|E
60|$|The steward came in {{very shortly}} after Mr. Walters left, and from <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face {{it was evident}} he had been rated {{severely}} for neglect of duty.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was evident}} Jim did not relish {{the idea of}} leaving {{everything}} to his companion, and the latter so understood <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> friend's face, for he said, angrily: ...|$|E
6000|$|Billy was posed again, and {{his father}} laughed at <b>the</b> perplexed <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> countenance, as he said, [...] "Never mind, boy, we'll find somethin' or other that will do instead o' hooks an' lines." ...|$|R
60|$|The little model dipped her pen in ink. Her eyes crept {{towards the}} door, where Hilary was still {{standing}} with <b>the</b> same <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face. He avoided her eyes, {{and went up to}} Mr. Stone.|$|R
60|$|He {{remained}} in the same attitude and with <b>the</b> same <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face {{for a minute or}} more; then glanced slowly round as if he had lost something; and went shivering back, towards the shed.|$|R
6000|$|She {{stopped at}} <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face. It {{was as if}} he were saying: [...] "I have left your world. Talk to your fellows; all this is nothing to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You can't {{throw it}} away, an' we must sneak off," [...] Dan said, and <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face told how distressed {{he was that}} such a {{responsibility}} had been thrust upon them.|$|E
60|$|Sam stared. From <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face it {{was evident}} that Webster {{imagined}} himself to have made a suggestion of exceptional intelligence. It struck Sam as the silliest he had ever heard.|$|E
60|$|He {{was looking}} at her in wonder; and <b>the</b> pained, puzzled <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face angered her.|$|R
60|$|When {{they got}} back to Chingford they saw Tom {{standing}} in solitude looking at them. Liza was struck by <b>the</b> woebegone <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face; {{she felt she had}} been cruel to him, and leaving the Blakestons went up to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Another great battle!" [...] screamed {{the excited}} news-boys in the streets. [...] "Another great battle!" [...] read Letty in the cottage parlor. [...] "Another great battle!" [...] cried David, {{coming in with}} <b>the</b> war-horse <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face {{a month or two}} after he enlisted.|$|R
6000|$|The negro {{looked at}} the captain and seemed frightened by <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face. For a moment he did not speak, {{and then in a}} {{trembling}} voice he asked, [...] "Where all them now?" ...|$|E
60|$|Suddenly my {{attention}} {{was arrested by}} a weedy looking young man rushing down the street at a great pace. It was <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face that was extraordinary--a curious mingling of terror and agitation.|$|E
60|$|Billy shrugged, {{and when}} their captors again urged them forward he went quietly; but <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face might have perturbed the Mexicans had they known Billy Byrne of Grand Avenue better--he was smiling happily.|$|E
60|$|He {{walked a}} little in front of us, and kept before us for some minutes. During this interval, I glanced at Ham again, and observing <b>the</b> same <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face, and his eyes still {{directed}} to the distant light, I touched his arm.|$|R
60|$|With these good-natured words, {{he strode}} away, and {{presently}} was heard, in company with Boxer, {{and the old}} horse, and the cart, making lively music down the road. What time the dreamy Caleb still stood, watching his blind daughter, with <b>the</b> same <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face.|$|R
6000|$|... "He's away in Paris," [...] Val said, {{staring at}} <b>the</b> very queer <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> uncle's face, like--like {{that of a}} snarling dog.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Mr. Carter quietly. <b>The</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face did not change, but Tommy {{caught the}} flicker of despair in his eyes. It {{convinced}} him as nothing else had done that the outlook was hopeless.|$|E
60|$|The Head {{started as}} if, supposing {{such a thing}} possible, someone had pinched him. He {{did not know what}} to make of the question. From <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face his visitor did not appear to be perpetrating a joke.|$|E
60|$|Captain Hampton made no reply, but had his {{companion}} {{turned to look}} at him he could hardly have avoided noticing that <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face expressed anything but sympathy with the tone of irritation in which he had himself spoken.|$|E
6000|$|... "On {{the roadway}} was a buggy and a horse, {{and in the}} buggy sat a smiling young woman. Why she smiled Sam could not imagine; but then, {{he could not see}} <b>the</b> comical <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own face <b>on</b> being thus {{suddenly}} aroused to a sense of his duty.|$|R
60|$|Jack {{sat down}} with a little grunt, and with <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> of dissatisfaction <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face in no way mollified.|$|R
60|$|When {{with her}} hat on she stood ready to go, {{it was getting}} dark. She {{had come out of}} her dream now, was playing at make-believe no more. And she stood with a stony smile, in the half-dark, looking between her lashes at <b>the</b> mortified <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> {{unconscious}} face.|$|R
