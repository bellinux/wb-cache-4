5|$|Directed by Eddie O'Flaherty, {{the film}} was written by J. P. Davis, who sold the script only on the {{condition}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> would play Tommy.

5|$|One of {{the biggest}} criticisms Steiner {{received}} was <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> believed what his fictive Hitler said about the Jews. It was also thought {{that at the end}} of the London theatre production, the audience were applauding Hitler and not the play.|$|E
5|$|Sigmund asks Odin why {{he would}} expect Eric {{more than any other}} king, to which Odin {{responds}} that Eric has reddened his gore-drenched sword with many other lands. Eric arrives, and Sigmund greets him, tells him that he is welcome to come into the hall, and asks him what other lords he has brought with him to Valhalla. Eric says that with him are five kings, that he will tell them the name of them all, and <b>that</b> <b>he,</b> <b>himself,</b> is the sixth.|$|E

5|$|With Soishiro Satake, Maeda {{formed the}} head of the second {{generation}} of Kodokan judoka, which had replaced the first {{by the beginning of the}} 20th century. Satake, at 175cm and 80kg, was unmatched in amateur sumo but admitted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> was not able to match Maeda in judo. Satake would later travel to South America with Maeda and settle in Manaus, Amazonas State, while Maeda continued traveling. Satake would become the founder, in 1914, of the first historically registered judo academy in Brazil. He and Maeda are considered the pioneers of judo in Brazil.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from his war service, Keenor met Muriel Griffiths, a church organist from Swansea {{who had worked}} in a munitions factory during the First World War. They were married soon after they met, on 11 November 1919, and they had their first child, Frederick, in May 1920. The couple {{would go on to}} have seven children together, their final child Graham being born in 1931. He settled his family in Whitchurch, Cardiff, in a house <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> had designed and helped build, and became a keen gardener, growing his own vegetables in the garden.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} stages of World War I, as Romania {{remained}} a neutral country, Caragiale's notes record that his friend Bogdan-Pitești was acting as a political agent of the Central Powers, and that money he made available had been provided by German propaganda funds. Nevertheless, the two figures were especially close to one another during and after 1915, and, in 1916, even visited Berlin together. At the time, Caragiale also visited the Germanophile literary circle set up by Mărgărita Miller Verghy, and borrowed a reported 10,000 lei from Bogdan-Pitești, which he never returned. Caragiale's own Germanophile preferences and traditionalist conservatism had by then extinguished his cultural Francophilia, and rumors spread <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> was a spy for the German Empire.|$|E

5|$|The genre {{entered a}} new level {{following}} the release of Little Caesar (1931), which featured Edward G. Robinson as gangster Rico Bandello. Caesar, along with The Public Enemy starring James Cagney as Tom Powers and Scarface (1932), featuring Paul Muni as Tony Comante, were, by standards of the time, incredibly violent films that created {{a new type of}} anti-hero. Nine gangster films were released in 1930, 26 in 1931, 28 in 1932, and 15 in 1933, when the genre's popularity began to subside after the end of Prohibition. The backlash against gangster films was swift. In 1931, Jack Warner announced that his studio would stop making them and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> had never allowed his 15-year-old son to see them.|$|E
5|$|Wagner's {{writings}} on Jews, including Jewishness in Music, corresponded to some existing trends of thought in Germany during the 19th century; however, despite his very public views on these themes, {{throughout his life}} Wagner had Jewish friends, colleagues and supporters. There have been frequent suggestions that antisemitic stereotypes are represented in Wagner's operas. The characters of Mime in the Ring, Sixtus Beckmesser in Die Meistersinger, and Klingsor in Parsifal are sometimes claimed as Jewish representations, though they are not identified as such in the librettos of these operas. The topic of Wagner and the Jews is further complicated by allegations, {{which may have been}} credited by Wagner, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> was of Jewish ancestry, via his supposed father Geyer.|$|E
5|$|After hearing {{news that}} Syed {{is trying to}} find his wife Amira Shah (Preeya Kalidas), Yusef visits her father, Qadim (Ramon Tikaram) at his office and offers to avenge his family for causing Amira pain. When Zainab and Yusef attend an event together, people assume they are married and Zainab does not correct them. Afterwards, Yusef admits to Zainab that he has great {{feelings}} for her but they should maintain some distance as she is married. Yusef continues to manipulate Zainab and ply her with pills, but she says she wishes to stop taking them, so Yusef crushes up a bottle of pills and conceals them in Zainab's food. Zainab passes out and is hospitalised, with her family believing she took a deliberate overdose, as was Yusef's plan. Concerned <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> is causing Zainab's worries, Masood divorces Zainab by saying the triple talaq.|$|E

5|$|Drusus {{then settled}} an {{incident}} involving {{the abuse of}} the protection afforded by icons of the princeps, in which the emperor's images were being used to shield the guilty. Gaius Cestius Gallus brought a complaint into the Senate, and claimed he was being abused under this safeguard by Annia Rufilla. Drusus was soon brought in to weigh on the matter, for the Senate felt only {{a member of the}} imperial family could speak on such a delicate matter. At the request of many senators, Drusus had Rufilla arrested and imprisoned. Later, he was given credit for the condemnation of two Roman equites, Considius Aequus and Coelius Cursor, who had attacked the praetor, Magius Caecilianus, with false charges of maiestas. It is unlikely <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> was responsible, for every verdict was given by the Senate with Tiberius' authority, but this did not prevent his popularity.|$|E
5|$|Harry learns from Snape's memories, {{that while}} Snape despised Harry's late father, James, who had bullied him, {{he loved his}} late mother, Lily. Following her death, Snape worked {{secretly}} with Dumbledore to protect Harry from Voldemort because of his love for Lily. Harry also learns Dumbledore was dying and wanted Snape to kill him, and that the Patronus doe {{he saw in the}} woods that led him to the sword had been conjured by Snape. Harry discovers <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> became a Horcrux when Voldemort originally failed to kill him and that Harry must die to destroy the piece of Voldemort's soul within him. Harry then surrenders himself to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest. Voldemort casts the Killing Curse upon Harry, who finds himself in limbo, where Dumbledore's spirit meets him and explains that the part of Voldemort within Harry was killed by Voldemort's own curse. Harry then returns to his body, determined to defeat Voldemort once and for all. He fakes being dead, and Narcissa Malfoy lies to Voldemort that Harry is dead after confirming that Draco is okay.|$|E
5|$|In February 1943, {{during the}} second phase of Case White, Lukačević and his Chetniks jointly held the town of Konjic on the Neretva river {{alongside}} Italian troops. After being reinforced by German and NDH troops and some additional Chetniks, the combined force held the town against concerted attacks by the Partisans over a seven-day period. The first attack was launched by two battalions of the 1st Proletarian Division on 19 February and was followed by repeated attacks by the 3rd Assault Division between 22 and 26 February. Unable to capture the town and its critical bridge across the Neretva, the Partisans eventually crossed the river downstream at Jablanica. Ostojić was aware of Lukačević's collaboration with the Germans and NDH troops at Konjic but, at his trial, Mihailović denied <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> was aware of it, claiming that Ostojić controlled the communications links and kept the information from him. During the fighting at Konjic, the Germans also supplied Lukačević's troops with ammunition. Both Ostojić and Lukačević were highly critical of what they described as Mihailović's bold but reckless tactics during Case White, indicating that Mihailović was largely responsible for the Chetnik failure to hold the Partisans at the Neretva.|$|E

5|$|In {{the prime}} universe, Nina Sharp helps {{to set up}} Massive Dynamic's {{resources}} to track these occurrences, preparing to deploy limited supplies of the amber substance to contain them if needed. Nina advises Olivia to find Sam Weiss, a man that William Bell had trusted and instructed Nina to also listen to. However, Sam has disappeared and cannot be found. Walter and Peter, along with Massive Dynamic staff, debate how to disable the machine, but Peter realizes <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> is the only option. Walter comes {{to recognize that the}} Observer's efforts from earlier ("The Firefly") were to prepare him to lose Peter. After preparing himself, Peter goes to touch the machine, but is sent flying by an electrical spark, wounding him and knocking him unconscious. At the hospital chapel, Walter tries to find repentance from God for his actions, while Olivia arrives after hearing the news. She steps outside to observe the sunset when Sam Weiss runs up to her and demands to be taken to the machine to stop what is already happening.|$|E
5|$|Paul's {{youngest}} son, Andrew (now {{played by}} Jordan Smith), comes {{to stay with}} his father. Paul suffers financial difficulties and embezzles money from Lassiter's. He also frames Declan for an accident at a building site, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> caused. Diana Marshall (Jane Badler) comes to Erinsborough to find evidence of Paul's embezzlement. Paul asks her to take over Lassiter's with him and they have sex. Rebecca gives Paul an ultimatum; leave Lassiter's or leave the family. He then hands over management of the hotel to Declan for six months. Paul discovers Diana is working with Declan to remove him from the company and he contacts Rosemary Daniels (Joy Chambers), who fires Diana. Meanwhile, Paul threatens Declan. When Rebecca finds out about Paul's affair and threats towards Declan, she pushes him from the Lassiter's mezzanine. Paul survives and blackmails Rebecca into staying with him, causing their marriage to deteriorate. Rebecca later convinces Paul to sign an affidavit, which states that his fall was an accident, and she leaves him and the country. Paul falls out with local councillor Ajay Kapoor (Sachin Joab) and plots to ruin Ajay's career, after the local police station is closed down and merged with another.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Ashley {{plays on}} the beach and builds sand castles. When Ashley's drunken mother phones, {{demanding}} to know where her son is, Uncle David feigns ignorance, telling her <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> is not in Sheppey but in Manchester. Taking Ashley to an abandoned military bunker, he injects an unknown substance into his nephew's vein as they kiss. Ashley enters an altered state of consciousness, and David guides him back to the caravan as they smoke marijuana. Once there, David gives Ashley a second injection, as they sit and look out at the shore. After dark, David places his near-catatonic nephew in a dog bed, showing him a copy of a picture book titled Is Britain Great?. He proceeds to give him a third and final injection, which he remarks will make Ashley lose consciousness and suffer organ failure. As Ashley dies, David professes that he has never loved anyone else as much before. The next morning, he goes onto the beach to place his nephew's body in a shallow grave, tearfully kissing the body goodbye before it is swept away by the sea.|$|E

5|$|Tijori's thriller Fox {{starring}} Arjun Rampal and Sunny Deol {{was delayed}} due to production issues. Upon release in September 2009, the film received poor reviews. In {{the same year}} {{it was announced that}} Tijori would direct a Vikram Bhatt-produced film titled Bhaag Johny. The cast included Muzzamil Ibrahim and 2 new actresses. During the film's shooting, Ibrahim had to leave the film due to his differences with Tijori and subsequently the film was shelved for a brief period. The following year, Bhatt announced <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> will direct the film, there would be a different lead actor and Tijori would play the role of a Pakistani policeman. Two years later it was reported that Tijori would direct Vikram Bhatt-produced film Love Games. His next directorial was an adult suspense thriller titled Dare You, starring debutante Alisha Khan who was selected after an audition of more than 800 girls. The film's poster was {{the first of its kind}} and featured the lead actress showing her middle finger. However, Tijori left the project due to creative differences with the film's producers. In 2013, he directed the film Rock'In Love which featured Hanif Hilal and Sandeepa Dhar in lead role. Do Lafzon Ki Kahani starring Randeep Hooda is Tijori's next directorial project.|$|E
5|$|In Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, Kain is {{introduced}} {{as a young}} human noble. In the game's prologue, he is murdered by assassins, and resurrected as a vampire by Mortanius, a necromancer. He is promised both vengeance and a cure to his vampirism if he can restore the nine Pillars of Nosgoth, edifices whose state dictates {{the vitality of the}} world; the nine guardians who symbiotically represent the Pillars were corrupted prior to his birth, and must be killed before the land can recover. During his quest, he meets the ancient vampire Vorador, who influences him to forsake his former humanity and accept his vampirism, and discovers the Soul Reaver, a legendary soul-devouring sword. Using the Reaver, he tries to alter the course of Nosgoth's history to prevent the Nemesis—a tyrant king—from coming to power. Tricked by Moebius, the guardian of time, Kain succeeds in destroying the Nemesis, but the temporal paradox this triggers results in a new timeline in which vampires have been hunted to extinction; Kain is left the last surviving vampire in Nosgoth. After systematically tracking down and killing most of the guardians, he confronts Mortanius—revealed as the guardian of death, and the orchestrator of Kain's assassination—and realizes <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> is the final guardian, and that the cure to his curse entails his own destruction. Faced with the obligation of self-sacrifice—thereby restoring the world, but ensuring the annihilation of the vampire race—or the alternative of destroying the Pillars to rule over the world in its miasmatic state, Kain opts for the latter choice, embracing vampirism as a blessing as the Pillars collapse.|$|E
5|$|Using the riddles, Bruce and his butler, Alfred, deduce the Riddler's secret identity. Chase is {{imprisoned by}} The Riddler and Two-Face in their hideout. Dick returns and becomes Batman's sidekick, Robin, after {{realising}} that the Caped Crusader {{could use a}} hand. Batman and Robin head to Riddler and Two-Face's lair, Claw Island, where they are separated. Robin encounters Two-Face and nearly kills him, but realizing {{that he does not}} have it in him to murder, Robin spares him. Two-Face gets the upper hand and captures Robin. Batman arrives at the lair, where Robin and Chase are held as hostages. The Riddler gives Batman a chance to save only one hostage, but Batman destroys the Riddler's brainwave collecting device, causing the Riddler to suffer a mental breakdown. Batman then rescues both Robin and Chase. Two-Face corners the trio and determines their fate with the flip of a coin, but Batman throws a handful of identical coins in the air, causing Two-Face to stumble and fall to his death. The Riddler is taken to Arkham Asylum and imprisoned, but he claims he knows who Batman is. Chase is asked to consult on the case, but Nygma says <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> is Batman, due to his damaged memories. Chase meets Bruce outside and tells him that his secret is safe before parting ways. Bruce resumes his crusade as Batman with Robin as his partner to protect Gotham from crime.|$|E
