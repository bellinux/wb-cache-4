5|$|But as Hohoff saw it, the {{manuscript}} {{was by no}} means fit for publication. It was, as she described it, “more a series of anecdotes than a fully conceived novel.” During the next couple of years, she led Lee from one draft to the next until the book finally achieved its finished form and was retitled <b>To</b> <b>Kill</b> <b>a</b> <b>Mockingbird.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>To</b> <b>Kill</b> <b>a</b> <b>Mockingbird</b> is a {{novel by}} Harper Lee {{published}} in 1960. It was immediately successful, winning the Pulitzer Prize, {{and has become a}} classic of modern American literature. The plot and characters are loosely based on Lee's observations of her family, her neighbors and an event that occurred near her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama, in 1936, when she was 10years old. The story is told by the six-year-old Jean Louise Finch.|$|E
5|$|Duvall, who had {{appeared}} in <b>To</b> <b>Kill</b> <b>a</b> <b>Mockingbird</b> (1962), which Foote adapted from the Harper Lee novel, was involved in Tender Mercies as an actor and co-producer from its earliest stages. He said the script appealed to him because of the basic values it underlined and because the themes were universal even though the story was local. Duvall felt it portrayed people from the central region of the United States without parodying them, as he said many Hollywood films tend to do. Duvall's early involvement led to rumors that he had requested Foote write the script for him, something that both men denied.|$|E

500|$|As {{children}} {{coming of}} age, Scout and Jem face hard realities {{and learn from}} them. Lee seems to examine Jem's sense of loss about how his neighbors have disappointed him more than Scout's. Jem says to their neighbor Miss Maudie {{the day after the}} trial, [...] "It's like bein' a caterpillar wrapped in a cocoon... I always thought Maycomb folks were the best folks in the world, least that's what they seemed like". This leads him to struggle with understanding the separations of race and class. Just as the novel is an illustration of the changes Jem faces, it is also an exploration of the realities Scout must face as an atypical girl on the verge of womanhood. As one scholar writes, [...] "To <b>Kill</b> <b>a</b> <b>Mockingbird</b> can be read as a feminist Bildungsroman, for Scout emerges from her childhood experiences with a clear sense of her place in her community and an awareness of her potential power as the woman she will one day be." ...|$|R
