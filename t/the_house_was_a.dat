5|$|Brettingham {{moved on}} to other projects. In the 1760s, he was {{approached}} by his most illustrious patron, the Duke of York (brother of King George III), to design one of the greatest mansions in Pall Mall, namely York House. The rectangular mansion that Brettingham designed was built in the Palladian style on two principal floors, with the state rooms as at Norfolk House, arranged in a circuit around the central staircase hall. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> mere pastiche of Norfolk House, but for Brettingham it had the kudos of a royal occupant.|$|E

5|$|Since 1965, George Harrison and his wife, Pattie Boyd, {{had lived}} in Kinfauns in Surrey, south of London. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{bungalow}} and too small to accommodate a home recording studio, so the couple began a year-long search for a larger property, concentrating on an area west of London encompassing the counties of Berkshire and Oxfordshire. In January 1970, Harrison purchased the 120-room Friar Park, set on 33 acres of land, just west of Henley-on-Thames. Previously the home of an order of Roman Catholic nuns, the Salesians of Don Bosco, the four-storey house and its grounds were in a dilapidated state, {{and it was not}} until the start of March that the Harrisons moved from a worker's cottage and into the main residence.|$|E

5|$|In 1970, the Ebenezer Avery House was {{in danger}} of being torn down to {{construct}} apartments and it was purchased by R. Stanton Avery. R. Stanton Avery purchased the property with the intention of turning it over to the Avery Memorial Association. Edwin Park, an architect, assessed the house as in need of extensive reconstruction and the association discussed the plan to move the house to Fort Griswold Battlefield State Park. A meeting held on the association on July 24, 1971, was held to discuss the movement plan which involved disassembling and reassembling the house at its new location. The project to move <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> shared cost between R. Stanton Avery and the Avery Memorial Association. By the 1972 meeting, the total cost of the relocation was $43,000 and the act provoked interest from the State of Connecticut. The house was donated to the State of Connecticut for use as a historic house museum.|$|E
5|$|Kenwood {{has three}} floors: {{on the ground}} floor during the Lennon period the front door opened onto an {{entrance}} hall, where Lennon placed a suit of armour and a gorilla suit. Across the hall was a large living room, which had black carpets, two 18-foot sofas and a marble fireplace. To the left of the hall was a toilet, and through the living room was a dining room, where purple, velvet wallpaper was put up. Adjacent to the dining room, at the back of <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> small sunroom. This was decorated with various pictures, caricatures and stickers, such as the one from the Safe as Milk debut album (1967) by Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band, and one advertising the Monterey Pop Festival. Photos published by The Beatles Book Monthly show the shelves of the sunroom filled with articles such as a large, ornate cross, a Mickey Mouse doll and a mortar and pestle, reportedly used by Lennon to mix various combinations of cocaine, amphetamine, barbiturates and LSD. There was also a yellow sofa or chaise-longue upon which Lennon would spend much of his time. It was a present from his aunt, Elizabeth Smith (née Stanley) also known as Mimi. Behind the sunroom was the split-level kitchen where state-of-the-art appliances were installed, so complex that a tutor had to come and give the Lennons lessons in their use.|$|E

Gabrielle and Carlos overhear Angie and Nick {{fighting}} about their secret, which prompts {{them to send}} Ana to a modeling academy in New York for her safety. Danny follows Ana without his parents' knowledge. Angie and Gabrielle travel to New York to bring Danny home and Angie confesses her past to Gabrielle in confidence. Patrick tracks Angie back to Fairview, where he hits Nick with his car. While Nick is in the hospital, Patrick moves into the Bolen home and takes Angie and Danny hostage and forces Angie to build him a second bomb. He plants the bomb inside the house and activates it with a detonator from down the street. However, the bomb in <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> decoy; Angie had planted the actual bomb in the detonator.

5|$|The family's {{fame and}} notoriety {{were to be}} short-lived. Subsequent generations settled down in Somerset to live the lives of county gentry, {{representing}} Somerset in Parliament and when necessary following occupations {{in the army and}} the church. This peaceful existence was jolted when the estate was inherited by William Phelips (1823–89), who in his early days made many improvements and renovations to Montacute. He was responsible for the Base Court, a low service range adjoining {{the south side of the}} mansion. and the restoration of the Great Chamber, which he transformed into a library. Later, he was to become insane; an addicted gambler, he was eventually incarcerated for his own good. Sadly for his family, this was after he had gambled away the family fortune and vast tracts of the Montacute Estate. In 1875, when his son William Phelips (1846–1919) took control of the estate, agricultural rents from what remained of the mortgaged estate were low, and <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> drain on limited resources. Selling the family silver and art works delayed the inevitable by a few years, but in 1911 the family were forced to let the house, for an annual sum of £650, and move out. The Phelipses never returned.|$|E
5|$|The three-story {{brick house}} {{includes}} a full elevated basement and a mansard roof with steeply pitched gabled dormers. Projecting from the roofline are plain corbeled chimneys and iron gillwork, the original roofing material was slate. The 1879 {{version of the}} Ellwood House featured dormer ornamentation with finial work. The original windows were all double-hung and of modest size, occurring both singly and in pairs while showing a variety of lintel designs. The original front (east) facade appeared much different than it does at present. The front entryway has been completely altered, due to Perry Ellwood's 1911 remodeling. The original entryway featured a one-story stone porch supported with two pilasters and two granite columns. The square projecting porch bay {{was connected to the}} ground via 12 stone stairs. In the southeast corner of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> full three-story projecting tower set at a 45° angle {{to the rest of the}} front facade.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} façade is {{the great}} south front, a two-storey colonnade of Corinthian columns superimposed on Tuscan, the whole surmounted by a central pediment. The columns are not stone, but wood coated in stucco. It is possible this facade was inspired by work done in Paris on the church of S. Sulpice by Giovanni Niccolo Servandoni who was working in England from 1747–51; some drawings made for Sir Francis Dashwood in emulation of his uncle's patronage of Palladian style, survive by him in the collection at West Wycombe. The executant architect for this elevation and {{for much of the}} work on the house appears to have been the minor architectural view painter John Donowell, who worked between 1761 and 1763 (although he had to wait until 1775 for payment). The façade, which has similarities to the main façade of Palladio's Palazzo Chiericati of 1550, was originally the entrance front. The front door is still in the centre of the ground floor leading into the main entry hall. This is a substantial deviation from the classical form of English Palladianism in which the main entrance and principal rooms would be on the first floor reached by an outer staircase, giving the main reception rooms elevated views, with the ground floor given over to service rooms. Such a radical re-arrangement was not possible here since <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> partial rebuild rather than a wholly new structure.|$|E
