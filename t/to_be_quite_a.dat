5|$|In 1962, {{the club}} {{followed}} Salisbury and {{stepped up to}} the Western League. This proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> different challenge—whereas before they had only competed against local teams in league competition, they now faced opposition from teams as far afield as Avon, Somerset and Devon as well as the reserve teams of league clubs such as Bristol Rovers, Bristol City and Torquay United. They generally fared well, only failing to finish in {{the top half of the}} table twice during their time at this level. Their first season in the Western League saw the club reach the first round proper of the FA Cup for the only time in their history after defeating Hendon 5–4 in a fourth qualifying round replay. On 3 November, Fourth Division side Gillingham came to the Walled Meadow and won 1–0 in front of 3484 spectators, a figure which would remain as the club's largest attendance for a home game. In the league Andover finished fourth, but that was their highest placing until 1969–70 when they finished as runners-up.|$|E

25|$|The litas was {{established}} at {{a value of}} 10 litų = 1US dollar and was subdivided into 100 centų. In the face of worldwide economic depression, the litas appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> strong and stable currency, reflecting the negligible influence of the depression on the Lithuanian economy. One litas was covered by 0.150462grams of gold stored by the Bank of Lithuania in foreign countries. In March 1923, the circulation amounted to 39,412,984 litas, backed by 15,738,964 in actual gold and by 24,000,000 in high exchange securities. It was required {{that at least one}} third of the total circulation would be covered by gold and the rest by other assets. By 1938, 1 U.S. dollar was worth about 5.9 litai, falling to about 20 U.S. cents before its disappearance in 1941.|$|E

25|$|The {{evolution}} of the MADS-box family has been extensively studied. These genes are present even in pteridophytes, but the spread and diversity is many times higher in angiosperms. There appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> bit of pattern into how this family has evolved. Consider the {{evolution of}} the C-region gene AGAMOUS (AG). It is expressed in today's flowers in the stamens, and the carpel, which are reproductive organs. It's ancestor in gymnosperms also has the same expression pattern. Here, it is expressed in the strobili, an organ that produces pollens or ovules. Similarly, the B-genes' (AP3 and PI) ancestors are expressed only in the male organs in gymnosperms. Their descendants in the modern angiosperms also are expressed only in the stamens, the male reproductive organ. Thus, the same, then-existing components were used by the plants in a novel manner to generate the first flower. This is a recurring pattern in evolution.|$|E

500|$|To {{depict the}} supernatural {{aspects of the}} show, the series makes use of visual, special, and make-up effects, as well as stuntwork. While various {{companies}} were contracted for the Los Angeles-based production of the pilot episode, subsequent episodes being filmed in Vancouver required a new crew to be hired. The company Entity FX performed the visual effects for the pilot episode, with Ivan Hayden taking over as visual effects supervisor {{for the rest of}} the season. The crew was required to design all of the external airplane shots in [...] "Phantom Traveler" [...] from scratch using computer-generated imagery (CGI). As well, they created a time-manipulation effect for the titular villain in [...] "Bloody Mary" [...] by altering the capture frame rate of the camera. Randy Shymkiw acted as special effects supervisor, and the department found the episode [...] "Asylum" [...] <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> challenge because one scene has the vengeful spirit collapse into dust. They made casts of the character's torso and hands, and had to find the perfect mixture in order to have the casts remain solid but disintegrate when needed.|$|E
500|$|In chapter 40, Gangleri muses that Valhalla must {{be quite}} crowded, to which High {{responds}} {{by stating that}} Valhalla is massive and remains roomy despite {{the large amount of}} inhabitants, and then quotes Grímnismál stanza 23. In chapter 41, Gangleri says that Odin seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> powerful lord, as he controls quite a big army, but he yet wonders how the Einherjar keep themselves busy when they are not drinking. High replies that daily, after they've dressed and put on their war gear, they go out to the courtyard and battle one another in one-on-one combat for sport. Then, when mealtime comes, they ride home to Valhalla and drink. High then quotes Vafþrúðnismál stanza 41. In chapter 42, High describes that, [...] "right at the beginning, when the gods were settling" [...] they had established Asgard and then built Valhalla. The death of the god Baldr is recounted in chapter 49, where the mistletoe that is used to kill Baldr is described as growing west of Valhalla.|$|E
500|$|The three DVD volumes {{released}} by Media Blasters were also reviewed by Mania.com. In {{the review of}} the first DVD, the reviewer Chris Beveridge described the anime as [...] "something different from the norm" [...] which [...] "mixes romance and comedy quite well". However, the pacing early on is felt as being [...] "awkward" [...] which [...] "takes time to really find its rhythm". For the second DVD volume, Beveridge commented that [...] "the mixing of the relationships continues to be the most interesting part of the show." [...] Beveridge goes on to state [...] "the mild moments of it are tacky and bad," [...] but [...] "when it comes to the core cast of characters, it's all solid material that is very enjoyable." [...] Finally, for the third volume, Beveridge wrote that [...] "despite the issues with how the series turns in the bonus OVA episode, Kashimashi has proven <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> lot of fun for the situations it presented." [...] The series is seen to [...] "close out rather well," [...] and [...] "not only is it good fun but it's also an enjoyable romantic show with lots of heart and emotion." ...|$|E

Sober, Gaga was still at her outlandish peak." [...] David Drake of Complex found the ArtRave <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> production but like all things Gaga does he found it to be a [...] "blend of the high-brow and the trashy, depth and superficiality, the thoughtful and the impulsive, and lots of other contradictions that make you think about the nature of philosophy and life and art." [...] He gave a positive review of the main show, praising the sound system, the performances of [...] "Gypsy" [...] and [...] "Do What U Want", and deduced that: [...] "Perhaps this kind of ambition is music's future, at least for a certain breed of artist. Although Artpop doesn't sound retro per se, Lady Gaga's project as a whole does feel like a reaction to the idea that as far as the music goes, there's nothing new under the sun." ...|$|E
500|$|She began {{performing}} at age six {{when she was}} cast in the lead singing role of [...] "Little Star" [...] in the Christmas play at her school, Fendalton Open Air School. After the show, a teacher who had watched the performance approached her parents {{to tell them that}} their daughter was [...] "pitch perfect". The teacher encouraged Westenra to learn how to play a musical instrument; Hayley soon after learned to read music and play the violin, piano, guitar, and recorder. She then began voice lessons and discovered a passion for musical theatre. By age 11, she had performed more than 40 times on stage, but was often given male parts: [...] "I got boy parts quite often. In ballet, there were not enough boys. So they ended up choosing half and half. I got chosen to wear the grey suit and the wig, and not the pretty dresses. In A Christmas Carol, I was Tiny Tim, so I got <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> sick, sick boy. There was a severe lack of singing boys and, at the time, it was quite disappointing." [...] Westenra attended Cobham Intermediate School in 1998 and 1999, where a performing arts building was later named in her honour. She won a talent quest in her first year (Year 9) at Burnside High School, which she attended from 2000 to 2003.|$|E

Get it? An appropriately hip-swaying beat swirls around the vocal, courtesy of ever-hitworthy producer Missy Elliott. This is the record that will propel Mýa to the A-list among today's pop/R icons; throughout the song, she delivers womanly strength and sass with a knowing wink. Moodring sounds like a perfect fit." ...|$|E
