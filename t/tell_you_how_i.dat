500|$|Flight attendants Lisa E. Wick and Lonnie Trumbull, both 20, were bludgeoned with a {{piece of}} lumber as they slept in their {{basement}} apartment in Seattle's Queen Anne Hill district on June 23, 1966 near the Safeway store where Bundy worked at the time, and where the women regularly shopped. Trumbull died. In retrospect, Keppel noted many similarities to the Chi Omega crime scene. Wick, who suffered permanent memory loss {{as a result of the}} attack, later contacted Ann Rule: [...] "I know that it was Ted Bundy who did that to us," [...] she wrote, [...] "but I can't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> know." [...] In the absence of incriminating evidence, Bundy's involvement remains speculative.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{begins the}} first verse {{of the song}} in a near-whisper, [...] "I thought that things like this get better with time / But I still need you / Why is that?" [...] The latter rhetorical {{question}} reappears throughout the song. In the chorus lines, she questions herself, [...] "I miss you / But if I got with you, could it feel the same?" [...] From the second verse and onwards, the song finds Beyoncé [...] "vocalizing an internal battle, alternately desperate and calm", as stated by Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle. She starts to sing in a double voice; her lower vocal notes are set as the song's base, while her voice in a heightened key is played over it. In the second verse, she sings, [...] "The words don’t ever seem to come out right / But I still mean em", pining for her ex-love interest and feeling self-conscious for doing so, [...] "It hurts my pride to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> feel, but I still need to" [...] before asking again, [...] "Why is that?". The bridge features Beyoncé chanting, [...] "No matter who you are / It is so simple / A feeling / But it’s everything." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reviewers have {{commented on}} how the book begins on a simple note (girl {{unexpectedly}} wins a school contest), and later moves into dark territory (family falls apart). In a 2005 interview at her college alma mater, Goldberg explained her motivation: [...] "I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> wrote the book. I did write it very consciously to get darker and stronger as it continues. I wanted it at first {{to be like this}} sunny, happy, Reader's Digest kind of read, and to lull people into this sense of complacency and then hit them over the head." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't insult your {{intelligence}} by <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> read that, especially as, rather {{against the}} strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do you {{remember}} that evening in the study?' she asked abruptly. 'We had been talking. <b>I</b> had been <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> had lived during those five years.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what has}} he been saying?" [...] demanded the aristocratic bully, coolly. [...] "Has he been <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> had to polish him off for {{insulting}} me?" ...|$|R
60|$|Did I ever <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> made {{acquaintance}} with Alec? In the Atlantic--about three {{hundred miles from}} land.|$|E
60|$|But I will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> {{can be an}} able {{minister}} of the New Testament, and of the Spirit who gives life.|$|E
6000|$|I {{forgot to}} <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> was. I am at present {{very well and}} my foot [...] goes but indifferently; I cannot {{perceive}} any alteration.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is the same!" [...] said Horace. [...] "Lady Janet, we {{are really}} {{interested}} in this. <b>You</b> remember my <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> first met with Grace? And you have heard more about it since, no doubt, from Grace herself?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> cannot <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> {{sincerely}} <b>I</b> {{feel for}} you in this affliction, Lady Kelsey.|$|R
6000|$|... 'To {{the end of}} {{all that}} is {{pleasant}} and easy and safe. Don't <b>you</b> remember my <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> dreaded the finish? Here I have been fairly comfortable and have in many respects enjoyed it. I have had you to talk to; {{and there has been a}} flavour of old days about it. What shall I be doing this time to-morrow?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would rather}} not <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> intend to act, sir; so that, in case of failure, you can disavow all {{knowledge}} of my proceedings." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Kenneth was my brother," [...] went on Leslie. [...] "Oh, I can't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> loved him. And he was cruelly killed. Do {{you know}} how?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Alton dryly; [...] "I'm {{afraid it}} will. Now I was a trifle {{confused}} when you helped me. Did I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> got it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear chap!' He {{shook hands}} unreservedly, {{and she gave}} back his grip without flinching. 'I can't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> pleased <b>I</b> am!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> sorry <b>I</b> am not {{to oblige}} you, Jethro, but I've {{arranged}} {{to give that}} post-office to Dave Wheelock." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all, Miss Beatrice, not at all; {{it was a}} most dreadful accident. <b>I</b> cannot <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> thankful <b>I</b> am--I can't, indeed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then,' said Mr Carker, 'I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> have {{stumbled}} on this boy of yours, and who I am, and what I {{am going to}} do for him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes." [...] She turned {{suddenly}} to Lady Janet. [...] "Let me <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> lost them," [...] she said, {{in the first}} tones of entreaty which had escaped her yet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because," [...] says he, [...] "I {{makes my}} {{livelihood}} by it. I leave you, and don't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>HOW</b> <b>I</b> make it: for {{it would make}} you none the happier to know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} very kindly treated in your lovely City, and {{everyone}} has been good to me. <b>I</b> cannot <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> grateful <b>I</b> am." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want {{to speak}} to you about the letter--to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> {{carefully}} <b>I</b> have kept it, <b>how</b> often <b>I</b> have read it," [...] said Fabio.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{shall be}} taken to Simba's town and there sacrificed to the devil Jana--I have not time to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how.</b> Therefore <b>I</b> propose to kill myself." ...|$|R
60|$|CONJURER. Doctor, {{there are}} about a {{thousand}} reasons why I should not <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> really did that trick. But one will suffice, {{because it is the}} most practical of all.|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> know. But I am sure of it!" [...] The Detective {{looked at}} her for some seconds in silence, and then threw {{a quick glance at}} me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will get}} in, uncle," [...] said I, [...] "and {{if you will}} let John drive the horses slowly around the yard, I will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> happen to be here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Crawley," [...] {{said the}} dean, [...] "I cannot <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> glad <b>I</b> am to see <b>you,</b> and <b>how</b> rejoiced <b>I</b> am that this {{accusation}} has fallen off from you." ...|$|R
6000|$|But Vanderbank, for enthusiasm, {{scarcely}} heard him. [...] "I can't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> admirable <b>I</b> think you." [...] Then eagerly, [...] "Does Nanda know it?" [...] he demanded.|$|R
6000|$|... "But it is {{necessary}} that Miss O'Mahony and you should understand each other also. My father trusts me, and <b>I</b> cannot <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> absolutely <b>I</b> obey him." ...|$|R
6000|$|Martin laughed. [...] "I shouldn't wonder," [...] he said, [...] "if we {{were about}} square. Well, if you will {{tell me how you}} found it out, I will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> did." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dick {{gave him}} a {{grateful}} look. [...] "It's difficult to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> feel about it, but I'll {{do my best to}} make good and show that you have not been mistaken." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Did he <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> pressed him?' There was no {{red tide}} this time, nor ever again whilst the {{interview}} lasted. To bow in affirmation was insufficient; {{with an effort}} he answered: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have so {{longed for}} a quiet word with you," [...] said Mrs Jehoram in a low tone. [...] "To <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> {{delightful}} <b>I</b> found your playing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't {{possible}} for me," [...] she said simply, [...] "to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> glad <b>I</b> am. Don't you yourself {{feel that you}} have done the right thing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Sheila, 'he's gone.' Lawford {{sighed and}} turned round. 'It's useless talking now, Sheila. No more questions. <b>I</b> cannot <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> tired <b>I</b> am. And my head--' ...|$|R
