5|$|By {{reaching}} the World Series with the Cardinals, <b>Tony</b> <b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> became the sixth manager to win pennants in both leagues. This was after La Russa had managed the Oakland Athletics to three straight pennants between 1988 and 1990 {{and winning the}} 1989 World Series. He would attempt to join Sparky Anderson as the only men to have managed teams to World Series championships in both leagues. He wore #10 in tribute to Anderson (who wore 10 while manager of the Cincinnati Reds) and to indicate {{he was trying to}} win the team's 10th championship.|$|E
5|$|Several {{managers}} {{have won the}} award in a season when they led their team to 100 or more wins. Lou Piniella won 116 games with the Seattle Mariners in 2001, the most by a winning manager, and Joe Torre won 114 with the New York Yankees in 1998. Sparky Anderson and <b>Tony</b> <b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> finished with identical 104–58 records in 1984 and 1988, respectively. Three National League managers, including Dusty Baker, Whitey Herzog, and Larry Dierker, have exceeded the century mark as well. Baker's San Francisco Giants won 103 games in 1993; Dierker's 1998 Houston Astros won 102 and Herzog led the Cardinals to 101 wins in the award's third season.|$|E
5|$|The lead {{would be}} {{augmented}} {{in the sixth}} when Carl Crawford hit a line drive that just cleared the right field wall for a home run. Though it appeared a fan may have reached over the wall to catch it, NL manager <b>Tony</b> <b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> did not challenge the umpires' call. The NL got a run back {{in the bottom of}} the inning when Carlos Beltrán led off with a triple and scored on a sacrifice fly by Griffey. The AL added some insurance runs in the eighth when Víctor Martínez hit a two-run home run just inside the left field foul pole to give the AL a 5–2 lead.|$|E

5000|$|Computer Gaming World in 1991 praised <b>Tony</b> <b>La</b> <b>Russa's</b> Ultimate Baseballs VGA graphics, and {{concluded}} that the game [...] "packs a tremendous amount into a single box". A 1992 review by the same author of expansion disks was less favorable. It praised the accuracy of a recreation of the 1990 Major League Baseball season, but criticized the incomplete rosters. The magazine stating that the game [...] "still falls short of its potential ... TLRUB may be a bit closer to the [...] "ultimate" [...] with these disks, but it's not there yet".

5|$|Since their 1882 establishment, the St. Louis Cardinals, {{originally}} {{known as}} the St. Louis Browns, have employed 63 managers. Ned Cuthbert was the franchise's original manager, and Mike Matheny is the team's current skipper. <b>Tony</b> <b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> leads the team in regular-season and postseason wins (1,231 and 33), regular-season and postseason losses (1,029 and 25), and playoff appearances (7). La Russa and Hall of Famer Billy Southworth won two World Series, tied for the most in club history by a single manager. Charles Comiskey leads the team in winning percentage (.685), {{and is one of}} thirteen Cardinals managers who have been elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame—three of whom (Comiskey, Southworth, Red Schoendienst) had multiple tenures with the club. La Russa and Whitey Herzog each won a Manager of the Year award with the Cardinals—Herzog in 1985 and La Russa in 2002, the fourth of his career.|$|E
5|$|The Manager of the Year Award is {{an honor}} given {{annually}} since 1983 to the best managers in the American and National Leagues. The winner is voted on by 28 members of the BBWAA. Each places a vote for first, second, and third place among the managers of each league. The manager with {{the highest score in}} each league wins the award. In 1991, Bobby Cox became the first manager to win the award in both leagues, winning with the Atlanta Braves and having previously won with the Toronto Blue Jays in 1985. <b>Tony</b> <b>La</b> <b>Russa,</b> Lou Piniella, and Jim Leyland have since won the award in both leagues. Joe Girardi is the only manager to win the award with a fourth-place team (2006 Florida Marlins); he is also the only manager to win the award after fielding a team with a losing record.|$|E
5|$|On April 13, {{pitching}} the Giants' home opener, Cain threw {{a complete}} game shut out, striking out 11. Facing 28 batters in 9 innings, {{one over the}} minimum, he allowed a single baserunner on a hit to James McDonald, the pitcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates. It was the third one-hitter of Cain's career. In his next start, on April 18, Cain threw another 9 shutout innings using only 91 pitches, dueling Cliff Lee of the Phillies who threw 102 pitches over 10 scoreless innings. The first 9 innings took only 1 hour and 49 minutes. The Giants {{went on to win}} in the 11th inning. Following a dominant first half, Cain was selected to the All-Star Game and was chosen by manager <b>Tony</b> <b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> to be the NL's starting pitcher. On July 10 at Kauffman Stadium, Cain allowed a leadoff single to Derek Jeter before retiring the six remaining hitters he faced; he was the winning pitcher in an 8–0 decision. On July 21, Cain hit his sixth career home run, off of Phillies' pitcher Cole Hamels in the third inning of a 10-inning, 65 Giants' victory. Later in that inning Hamels hit his first career home run off of Cain, making this the first time since 2002 when two pitchers have homered off of each other in the same game (Kevin Millwood and Denny Stark were the last to do it).|$|E

25|$|After 81 {{games on}} June 29, the half-way {{point of the}} season, the team was 43–38 (.531) only 1 game behind the Milwaukee Brewers at 44–37 (.543). The Cardinals played very poorly for much of June, going 3–12 from June 10 to 26. At some time {{around the end of}} June, manager <b>Tony</b> <b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> decided to retire {{at the end of the}} season. He kept that {{decision}} secret from the team.|$|E
25|$|The Cardinals won the National League Central Division {{championship}} in 2000. Injuries to other pitchers left Ankiel and Darryl Kile {{as the only}} fully healthy starters left on the roster. Cardinals manager <b>Tony</b> <b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> chose Ankiel to start Game One of the National League Division Series against veteran pitcher Greg Maddux of the Braves. To shield Ankiel from media pressure, La Russa had Kile answer questions to the media as if to start Game One, and afterwards informed the media that Ankiel was starting.|$|E
5000|$|The Cardinals {{made their}} first World Series {{appearance}} since , when they defeated the Detroit Tigers four games to one {{to win their}} National League-leading 10th World Series title. This was manager <b>Tony</b> <b>La</b> <b>Russa's</b> sixth World Series appearance as manager and his third with the Cardinals. The Cardinals' last postseason appearance was in 2009, where they were swept by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Division Series. They finished the 2010 season {{with a record of}} 86-76 (...) , finishing in second-place in the National League Central standings, five games behind the Cincinnati Reds.|$|R
5000|$|The Athletics' on-field mediocrity, however, {{contained}} a few bright spots. Mark McGwire clubbed 39 {{home runs in}} a mere 104 games; he would hit at least 50 {{in each of the}} four subsequent seasons. The 1995 season also saw the debut of future superstar Jason Giambi. Giambi, in his first major league season, batted [...]256 with six home runs in 54 games. Lastly, the season was <b>Tony</b> <b>La</b> <b>Russa's</b> last as Oakland's manager. He, along with most of the Athletics' assistant coaches, would join the St. Louis Cardinals in 1996.|$|R
5000|$|Taguchi {{got another}} brief call-up in , then got more playing {{time with the}} Cardinals in , {{appearing}} in 109 games. He was included on the '04 Cardinals postseason roster, and appeared in two games of the 2004 World Series, which the Cardinals lost to the Boston Red Sox in a four-game sweep. In , injuries to outfielders Larry Walker and Reggie Sanders opened up manager <b>Tony</b> <b>La</b> <b>Russa's</b> lineup card, and Taguchi became an everyday player. He responded with his best season, batting [...]288 in 396 at-bats with eight home runs and fifty-three RBI, and contributing with his stellar defense at all three outfield positions as the Cardinals won 100 games and had {{the best record in}} the National League.|$|R
25|$|Organizers hoped {{as many as}} 300,000 would attend, {{with the}} National Park Service {{preparing}} for 100,000 and the D.C.

Former Governor of Alaska and 2008 Republican Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin and Alveda King, niece of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., were as announced speakers. Expected attendees included Major League Baseball player Albert Pujols and MLB manager <b>Tony</b> <b>La</b> <b>Russa,</b> both of whom decided to attend after being assured by Beck that the rally would not be political. Beck broadcast his TV show from the Fox News Washington studio instead of New York in the week {{leading up to the}} event.|$|E
25|$|After {{spending}} {{a couple years}} {{with his wife and}} three children, Pendleton got his first coaching job in November 2001 as the hitting coach of the Atlanta Braves. Pendleton served in that role through the 2010 season. In 2006, he was on a short list of people to replace Frank Robinson as manager of the Washington Nationals, only to withdraw himself from consideration a few weeks into the process. He was also reportedly one of the frontrunners to be the next St. Louis Cardinals' manager before <b>Tony</b> <b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> decided to stay with the Cardinals. He was a candidate to replace Bobby Cox when the esteemed Braves manager retired {{at the end of the}} 2010 season.|$|E
25|$|On August 9, 2007, the Cardinals {{promoted}} Ankiel from Memphis after {{a roster}} spot was vacated by Scott Spiezio's departure. In his first game, Ankiel batted second and played right field. In his first at bat, {{he received a}} prolonged standing ovation from the St. Louis crowd. During the seventh inning, he hit a three-run home run off Doug Brocail to right field to help the Cardinals defeat the San Diego Padres, 5–0. It was his first {{home run in the}} majors since April 2000 (as a pitcher), and made him the first player since Clint Hartung (1947) to hit his first major league home run as a pitcher and then hit a home run as a position player. The player before Hartung who accomplished this was Babe Ruth. After the game, <b>Tony</b> <b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> said that his only happier moment as a Cardinal was when they won the 2006 World Series. Two days later, against the Dodgers on August 11, Ankiel drew three standing ovations. He had three hits, including two home runs and three RBIs and made a spectacular catch in right field.|$|E
5000|$|Taguchi {{returned}} to the Cardinals in 2007 and had another solid season, batting [...]290 as a part-time player, with 307 at-bats in 130 games. He was one of manager <b>Tony</b> <b>La</b> <b>Russa's</b> most valuable pinch-hitters; of 46 games in 2007 where he's shown to have had just 1 AB, Taguchi picked up 15 hits. Taguchi played 617 innings in the field, with 41 starts (and 22 other appearances) in center (where Jim Edmonds was banged up) and 21 starts (20 other) in left (where the Cardinals hadn't settled on one player until 2008 and Skip Schumaker). Taguchi played sparingly in right field (2 starts, 6 other) {{and part of a}} game at 2B.|$|R

Nonetheless, <b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> felt that his induction to the Hall was due to his tenures with all three teams, and stated that not including a logo meant that [...] "fans of all three clubs can celebrate this honor with me."

5000|$|On January 24, 2008, Matheny {{returned}} to the St. Louis Cardinals organization as a special adviser {{for the first two}} weeks of spring training. They announced him as their new manager on November 14, 2011, following <b>Tony</b> <b>La</b> <b>Russa's</b> retirement, making him the youngest manager in the major leagues. [...] The move was seen as unexpected as Matheny had no prior managing or coaching experience in professional baseball besides that as a minor league instructor. Moreover, he was taking over a team that had just won the World Series and for another manager who was one of the top three achievers in wins for the role in major league history. Matheny's other prior coaching experience included Little League Baseball and other interviewees included Terry Francona, Ryne Sandberg, José Oquendo, Chris Maloney and Joe McEwing, all of whom already had managerial or coaching experience in the major leagues. [...] In spite of the lack of substantial achievement as demonstrated by his competitors, Matheny guided the Cardinals to a winning record and a playoff and NLCS appearance in each of his first three seasons, becoming the fifth manager in major league history to accomplish this.|$|R
500|$|Both teams {{also won}} {{one of the}} next three World Series in {{successive}} years; the Cardinals, as noted above, in , beating the Detroit Tigers in five games, becoming the first team since the New York Yankees in , to win a World Series championship in their first season in a new stadium (which the Yankees themselves would also do in [...] ). <b>Tony</b> <b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> would achieve the distinction that he couldn't achieve in 2004 of managing World Series winners in both leagues. He would continue to wear number 10 {{to pay tribute to}} Sparky Anderson afterwards.|$|E
500|$|By 2011, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that Craig was able to hit major league pitching as well he had in the minor leagues. [...] However, the situation was less than ideal for him to realize regular playing time. Lance Berkman, Matt Holliday, and Albert Pujols each already occupied corner positions first base, left field and right field – positions Craig was best suited to play. [...] To get his bat in the lineup more, manager <b>Tony</b> <b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> began playing him at second base near the end of May.|$|E
500|$|<b>Tony</b> <b>La</b> <b>Russa,</b> Henderson's {{manager in}} the late 1980s in Oakland, said, [...] "He rises to the occasion—the big moment—better than anybody I've ever seen."

[...] Teammate Mitchell Page said, [...] "It wasn't until I saw Rickey that I {{understood}} what baseball was about. Rickey Henderson is a run, man. That's it. When you see Rickey Henderson, I don't care when, the score's already 1–0. If he's with you, that's great. If he's not, you won't like it." ...|$|E
