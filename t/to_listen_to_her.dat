Initially, Aang is only able to give Korra glimpses of his memory concerning Yakone in relation to her confrontations with his two sons, Amon and Tarrlok, the products of Yakone's Bloodbending vendetta on the Avatar. It is only after she loses her ability to bend that Korra allows herself <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> past lives, at which point Aang restores her powers by triggering the Avatar State and teaching her to Energybend.|$|E

He goes to the Swansons' house and sets a bag of feces on fire on their porch, and writes “That’s enough, John Mayer” in spraypaint {{on the wall of}} the Quahog Mini-Mart. Lois sees Chris sneaking back into his room and is going to punish him but Chris tells her that Doug said he does not have <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> This outrages Lois, {{deciding}} to go to Goldman's Pharmacy the next day and get some astringent to get rid of Doug. However, the next day, as Peter and Lois head to Goldman’s, they realize there has been a break-in, and someone has destroyed Mort’s entire stock of acne medication. That night, when Brooke comes over for dinner to meet Brian’s family, Doug tells Chris to lift up Brooke’s shirt, while Stewie asks how long Brooke has been a hooker. He does this, shocking and offending the family. Joe comes in, saying he has proof that it was Chris who vandalized, broke into Goldman’s Pharmacy and stole Mort's acne medication. Chris decides he no longer wants to listen to Doug after he made his mom cry, but Doug says he could make Chris punch himself, or even worse, shoot him in the brain. Chris finally winds up at the dermatology clinic, and a struggle ensues as Doug tries to shoot him in the brain, but Chris manages to overpower him and use cortisone on Doug, finally taking him out.|$|E

25|$|Cavaradossi tells Angelotti of {{a chamber}} {{in an ancient}} Roman well on the {{property}} where he can hide until he makes his escape. It had been used by one of Cavaradossi's ancestors when he fled Rome after stabbing a Medici. Tosca arrives to confront her lover about the fan Scarpia had shown her. Cavaradossi and Angelotti explain everything and she realizes with horror {{that she has been}} duped into leading Scarpia to them. On hearing the arrival of Scarpia and his men, Angelotti seeks refuge in the well. Scarpia demands to know where Angelotti is hidden. When Tosca and Cavardossi refuse to tell, Cavaradossi is taken off to be interrogated by the Procureur and tortured by Scarpia's assistant if he refuses to answer. Scarpia describes the torture device in great detail to Tosca, who is then made <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> lover's screams. Unable to bear it any longer, she reveals the hiding place, much to Cavaradossi's fury. Rather than be captured, Angelotti takes poison concealed in his ring. Scarpia orders his men to take Cavaradossi to the Castel Sant'Angelo for execution and orders Tosca to be brought there as well.|$|E
25|$|She {{continued}} her {{study at the}} Fukien Christian University, which was a top university {{at that time in}} China. She graduated at the age of 22 from this university and earned the bachelor's degree in Physics. Because she was the best one in her class and this university wanted to hire some women, she got the chance to stay in this university and work for 8 years. For the first four years, she worked as an assistant to teach some fundamental courses such as mechanism. She taught so well that many students who were not in this class wanted <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> courses. After that she wrote a book named Course for Experiments in Optics and got the certification as a professor. Fukien Christian University had many exchange programs with New York University at that time and many teachers who worked more than 2 years could get the chance to study abroad. However, because she was not a Christian, the person in charge of this program didn’t give her the chance. So she applied for Dickinson College and got a full scholarship by the help of her workmate named Lairong Li.|$|E

After a confrontation with Maggie at the hospital, Scully walks through Chinatown. Seeing the woman who appeared earlier at the crosswalk, she follows her to a small Buddhist temple before the mysterious woman seemingly vanishes. Inside the temple, Scully has a vision of what is ailing Waterston. She returns to the hospital with Azar to visit Waterston.|$|E

5000|$|Reviewing {{the album}} for AllMusic, Scott Yanow wrote that [...] "...even {{if the results}} are not all that unique, her voice is often in near-miraculous form. ...Sassy sounds in prime form, on such songs as [...] "I Didn't Know What Time It Was," [...] "Autumn Leaves," [...] "The Island" [...] and [...] "You Are Too Beautiful."

500|$|While the {{marriage}} was based on warmth and esteem on Rosebery's side and adoration on Hannah's, it seems that Rosebery often found his wife's devotion irritating, and this sometimes caused him to be impatient with her. He was often abrupt with her in public. She, by contrast, was completely enraptured by him, and would frequently ignore her neighbours {{at a dinner party}} <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> husband's conversation further down the table, a faux pas almost considered a crime in Victorian society. Those who saw the couple alone at home [...] "could not doubt the affection as well as the comprehension that united them." ...|$|E

Hoping to improve relations, Chamorro's administration repealled the law that required the country to seek compensation in the case of Nicaragua v. United States, which had long been contentious, and withdrew the suit. The United States had refused to recognise the judgment of the International Court of Justice, which had found five years earlier that the US had violated international law by sponsoring the Contras and ordered reparations to be made.|$|E
500|$|The Three-Eyed Raven begins {{transferring}} {{knowledge to}} Bran as {{the army of}} wights arrives. While in a vision of Winterfell, Bran hears the cries of Meera Reed {{who is trying to}} save Bran's body while the Children hold back the wights. The Three-Eyed Raven advises Bran <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> and Bran splits his consciousness by both remaining in the vision of the past and simultaneously warging into Hodor in the present. The Night King enters the cave and kills the Three-Eyed Raven. As Bran, Meera and Hodor make their escape, Leaf and Bran's direwolf, Summer, sacrifice themselves to hold back the wights. Hodor closes the hideout's door behind them, keeping the wights inside while Meera escapes with Bran. Meera repeatedly orders Hodor to [...] "hold the door" [...] shut while they flee, which results in the Wights tearing him apart. In the vision, Bran becomes overwhelmed by the split consciousness and unintentionally wargs into a younger version of Hodor in the vision, then known as Wylis, forging a connection between the past and present. With Bran's consciousness inside his head, Wylis suffers a seizure while hearing the echoes of Meera's orders and he begins to yell the words [...] "hold the door" [...] over and over, until they slur together and [...] "Hodor" [...] is all that's left that he can say.|$|E

500|$|Contrary to {{her promise}} to Sam, Ruby tells Dean that she cannot {{actually}} save him from Hell {{and that she}} had lied to Sam to get him <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> However, in the season finale [...] "No Rest for the Wicked", she tells Sam that she had lied to Dean and that she truly can help Sam save him. Her plan is to train Sam to harness his latent demonic abilities so that he can use them to kill Lilith, the demon who holds the contract for Dean's soul. Believing that Ruby is trying to manipulate Sam into giving in to his dark side, Dean tricks her into a devil's trapa mystical symbol capable of rendering demons powerlessand leaves with Sam to face Lilith. Ruby frees herself and tracks the brothers down during their campaign, but gets expelled from her host body by Lilith and thus is not present at the confrontation between Lilith and the brothers, with her whereabouts at the time unclear. The fourth season episode [...] "I Know What You Did Last Summer" [...] states that she had been sent back to Hell. Eventually, Ruby returns and offers Sam her help in taking revenge on Lilith for Dean's death in [...] "No Rest for the Wicked" [...] as well as in stopping Lilith's apocalyptic plans. To appease Sam, who dislikes her using a living host against the host's will, Ruby takes possession of a body recently declared to be dead (Genevieve Cortese). They have sex together at least once, and she brings him out of his downward spiral towards self-destruction. Consequently, Sam now trusts Ruby implicitly.|$|E
