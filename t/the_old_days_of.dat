25|$|In February 1996, Yeltsin {{announced}} that he would seek a second term in the summer 1996 Russian presidential election. The announcement followed weeks of speculation that Yeltsin {{was at the end of}} his political career because of his health problems and growing unpopularity in Russia. At the time Yeltsin was recuperating from a series of heart attacks. Domestic and international observers also noted his occasionally erratic behaviour. When campaigning opened in early 1996, Yeltsin's popularity was close to zero. Meanwhile, the opposition Communist Party had already gained ground in parliamentary voting on 17 December 1995, and its candidate, Gennady Zyuganov, had a strong grass roots organization, especially in the rural areas and small towns, and appealed effectively to memories of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> Soviet prestige on the international stage and the socialist domestic order.|$|E
2500|$|In the Narnian year 1998, Narnia was {{invaded by}} {{people from the}} West called the Telmarines, {{descendants}} of pirates from Earth, and so began the Telmarine Age of Narnia. Led by Caspian I, they left their land in the West to escape a great famine and reached Narnia by crossing a pass in the mountains. After years of Telmarine rule, the native [...] "Old Narnians" [...] decreased in number and went into hiding. Humans became the dominant species. By {{the time of the}} birth of Caspian X (a direct descendent of Caspian I), <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> Narnia were widely regarded as legendary and knowledge of the Old Narnians was actively suppressed by the Telmarine kings. People began to fear the woods and the sea, and to forget that the old creatures had once lived there.|$|E

Phyllis and Sally were {{roommates}} while in the Follies, and Ben and Buddy were best friends at school in New York. When Sally sees Ben, her former lover, she greets him self-consciously ("Don't Look at Me"). Buddy and Phyllis join their spouses and the foursome reminisces about <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> their courtship and the theatre, their memories vividly coming {{to life in the}} apparitions of their young counterparts ("Waiting For The Girls Upstairs"). Each of the four is shaken at the realization of how life has changed them. [...] Elsewhere, Willy Wheeler (portly, in his sixties) cartwheels for a photographer. Emily and Theodore Whitman, ex-vaudevillians in their seventies, perform an old routine ("The Rain on the Roof"). Solange proves she is still fashionable at what she claims is 66 ("Ah, Paris!"), and Hattie Walker performs her old showstopping number ("Broadway Baby").|$|E
2500|$|After {{the fall}} of apartheid, Smith helped build a multiracial {{congregation}} in Pretoria. [...] Smith {{continued to be a}} critic of the (originally white-only) Dutch Reformed Church for perceived slowness in integrating with the Uniting Reformed Church in Southern Africa (the successor to the anti-apartheid Dutch Reformed Church in Africa). [...] He wrote Die Afrikaner Broederbond: Belewinge van die Binnekant, a book critical of the Afrikaner Broederbond, in 2009. [...] He still opined on politics as well; in a 2009 article in the Afrikaans newspaper Beeld, he warned Afrikaners that the democratic transition of 1994 had averted a disaster akin to the near-complete exile of white Algerians after the Algerian Independence War. [...] There, France and its white Algerian minority did not give up power peacefully, which led to the violence of the war. [...] In Smith's view, too much nostalgia for <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> special [...] "cultural rights" [...] risked a similar disaster; white Afrikaners should not complain about the black-dominated government in racial terms or ask for an end to affirmative action, but instead be loyal citizens of South Africa.|$|E
2500|$|In <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the IBMXF {{when you}} raced an IBMXF sanctioned race you {{received}} NBL state points and points that went toward your international standing, but no national NBL points that counted toward contention for national number one plates. The World Championship title {{was open to}} 16 & over Experts and older amateurs in the 20" [...] class as well as Pros in the 20" [...] class. There is a class in European BMX called Superclass. In this class, which is ahead of Expert and the last step before going pro, amateurs race for and win money, an odd contradiction of the generally accepted definition of amateur. However, no racer in Superclass could win more than US$200 per event and keep their amateur standing. This class has been carried over in the UCI after the merger with the IBMXF. In the United States IBMXF affiliate the NBL, Superclass {{is the equivalent of}} the old [...] "B" [...] pro class and [...] "A" [...] pro is now called the Elite as per UCI practice. However, for the first few years the IBMXF while there was a pro class, the professionals did not race for money but trophies just like the amateurs and the prestige of being declared World Champions with its associate side benefits in marketing. It was not until 1987 did the pro race for award purses at the IBMXF World Championships.|$|E
