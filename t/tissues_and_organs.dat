5|$|The {{precision}} of brachytherapy enables a high dose of targeted radiation {{to be delivered}} to the cervix, while minimising radiation exposure to adjacent <b>tissues</b> <b>and</b> <b>organs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Once {{growth and}} {{development}} are completed, vitamins remain essential nutrients for the healthy maintenance of the cells, <b>tissues,</b> <b>and</b> <b>organs</b> {{that make up a}} multicellular organism; they also enable a multicellular life form to efficiently use chemical energy provided by food it eats, and to help process the proteins, carbohydrates, and fats required for cellular respiration.|$|E
30|$|The {{persistent}} <b>tissue</b> <b>and</b> <b>organ</b> shortage {{has led to}} {{the emergence}} of regenerative medicine. This interdisciplinary field involving biology, medicine and engineering aims to repair, replace, maintain or enhance <b>tissue</b> <b>and</b> <b>organ</b> functions by means of cell therapy [1].|$|R

40|$|A newly {{designed}} dish for <b>tissue</b> <b>and</b> <b>organ</b> culturing is demonstrated. This dish {{consists of two}} sections (cover and container) and one accessory (rubber stopper). The dish {{can be used for}} culturing in both closed and open systems. Easy manipulation is demonstrated in feeding, media changing, harvesting and washing. Therefore, this dish is a possible substitute for many other items now used in <b>tissue</b> <b>and</b> <b>organ</b> culturing...|$|R
5|$|The major {{means of}} {{respiration}} in teleosts, {{as in most}} other fish, is the transfer of gases {{over the surface of}} the gills as water is drawn in through the mouth and pumped out through the gills. Apart from the swim bladder, which contains a small amount of air, the body does not have oxygen reserves, and respiration needs to be continuous over the fish's life. Some teleosts exploit habitats where the oxygen availability is low, such as stagnant water or wet mud; they have developed accessory <b>tissues</b> <b>and</b> <b>organs</b> to support gas exchange in these habitats.|$|E
5|$|To {{accurately}} {{plan the}} brachytherapy procedure, a thorough clinical examination is performed {{to understand the}} characteristics of the tumour. In addition, a range of imaging modalities can be used to visualise the shape and size of the tumour and its relation to surrounding <b>tissues</b> <b>and</b> <b>organs.</b> These include x-ray radiography, ultrasound, computed axial tomography (CT or CAT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The data from many of these sources can be used to create a 3D visualisation of the tumour and the surrounding tissues.|$|E
5|$|Invertebrates {{constitute}} {{a vast array}} of living organisms ranging from the simplest unicellular eukaryotes such as Paramecium to such complex multicellular animals as the octopus, lobster and dragonfly. They {{constitute a}}bout 95% of the animal species. By definition, none of these creatures has a backbone. The cells of single-cell protozoans have the same basic structure as those of multicellular animals but some parts are specialized into the equivalent of <b>tissues</b> <b>and</b> <b>organs.</b> Locomotion is often provided by cilia or flagella or may proceed via the advance of pseudopodia, food may be gathered by phagocytosis, energy needs may be supplied by photosynthesis and the cell may be supported by an endoskeleton or an exoskeleton. Some protozoans can form multicellular colonies.|$|E

5|$|Monocytes {{develop in}} the bone marrow and reach {{maturity}} in the blood. Mature monocytes have large, smooth, lobed nuclei and abundant cytoplasm that contains granules. Monocytes ingest foreign or dangerous substances and present antigens to other cells of the immune system. Monocytes form two groups: a circulating group and a marginal group that remain in other tissues (approximately 70% are in the marginal group). Most monocytes leave the blood stream after 20–40 hours to travel to <b>tissues</b> <b>and</b> <b>organs</b> {{and in doing so}} transform into macrophages or dendritic cells depending on the signals they receive. There are about 500 million monocytes in one litre of human blood.|$|E
5|$|Like other insects, {{grasshoppers}} {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} and their body cavities are filled with haemolymph. A heart-like structure in {{the upper part of}} the abdomen pumps the fluid to the head from where it percolates past the <b>tissues</b> <b>and</b> <b>organs</b> on its way back to the abdomen. This system circulates nutrients throughout the body and carries metabolic wastes to be excreted into the gut. Other functions of the haemolymph include wound healing, heat transfer and the provision of hydrostatic pressure, but the circulatory system is not involved in gaseous exchange. Respiration is performed using tracheae, air-filled tubes, which open at the surfaces of the thorax and abdomen through pairs of valved spiracles. Larger insects may need to actively ventilate their bodies by opening some spiracles while others remain closed, using abdominal muscles to expand and contract the body and pump air through the system.|$|E

25|$|Aging is an {{accumulation}} of damage to macromolecules, cells, <b>tissues</b> <b>and</b> <b>organs.</b> If any of that damage can be repaired, the result is rejuvenation.|$|E
25|$|Iron {{accumulation}} in the <b>tissues</b> <b>and</b> <b>organs</b> {{results in}} a corresponding iron deficiency in the blood, leading to anemia. Anemia and diabetes usually occur by the time an affected person is {{in his or her}} twenties.|$|E
25|$|Distributive shock is {{a medical}} {{condition}} in which abnormal distribution of blood flow in the smallest blood vessels results in inadequate supply of blood to the body's <b>tissues</b> <b>and</b> <b>organs.</b> It {{is one of four}} categories of shock, a condition where there is not enough oxygen-carrying blood to meet the metabolic needs of the cells which make up the body's <b>tissues</b> <b>and</b> <b>organs.</b> Distributive shock is different from the other three categories of shock in that it occurs even though the output of the heart is at or above a normal level. The most common cause is sepsis leading to type of distributive shock called septic shock, a condition that can be fatal.|$|E

25|$|Prostaglandins {{are found}} in most <b>tissues</b> <b>and</b> <b>organs.</b> They are {{produced}} by almost all nucleated cells.

25|$|Vitamin D {{overdose}} causes hypercalcemia, {{which is}} a strong indication of vitamin D toxicity – this can be noted {{with an increase in}} urination and thirst. If hypercalcemia is not treated, it results in excess deposits of calcium in soft <b>tissues</b> <b>and</b> <b>organs</b> such as the kidneys, liver, and heart, resulting in pain and organ damage.|$|E
25|$|The {{regrowth}} of lost tissues or organs in {{the human}} body is being researched. Some tissues such as skin regrow quite readily; others have been thought to have little or no capacity for regeneration, but ongoing research suggests that there is some hope for a variety of <b>tissues</b> <b>and</b> <b>organs.</b> Human organs that have been regenerated include the bladder, vagina and the penis.|$|E

25|$|Animals are eukaryotic, {{multicellular}} {{organisms that}} form the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals are motile (able to move), heterotrophic (consume organic material), reproduce sexually, and their embryonic development includes a blastula stage. The body plan of the animal derives from this blastula, differentiating specialized <b>tissues</b> <b>and</b> <b>organs</b> as it develops; this plan eventually becomes fixed, although some undergo metamorphosis at some stage in their lives.|$|E
25|$|Organisms are {{classified}} by taxonomy into specified {{groups such as}} the multicellular animals, plants, and fungi; or unicellular microorganisms such as a protists, bacteria, and archaea. All types of organisms are capable of reproduction, growth and development, maintenance, and some degree of response to stimuli. Humans are multicellular animals composed of many trillions of cells which differentiate during development into specialized <b>tissues</b> <b>and</b> <b>organs.</b>|$|E
25|$|Slow cooling methods rely on {{the fact}} that cells contain few {{nucleating}} agents, but contain naturally occurring vitrifying substances that can prevent ice formation in cells that have been moderately dehydrated. Some cryobiologists are seeking mixtures of cryoprotectants for full vitrification (zero ice formation) in preservation of cells, <b>tissues,</b> <b>and</b> <b>organs.</b> Vitrification methods pose a challenge in the requirement to search for cryoprotectant mixtures that can minimize toxicity.|$|E
