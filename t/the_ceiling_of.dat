5|$|A great {{portion of}} the mosque is covered with whitewash, but the drum of the dome and the walls {{immediately}} beneath it are decorated with mosaics and marble. Some paintings by an Italian artist were introduced when repairs were undertaken at the mosque after an earthquake ravaged the mosque in 1927. <b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> the mosque was painted with funding by King Farouk of Egypt.|$|E
5|$|At Utica Avenue on the IND Fulton Street Line, a four-track station above {{can be seen}} in <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> the {{existing}} station. This portion of the Utica Avenue Line was built with the construction of the Fulton Street Line. Ramps were built from the mezzanine to the platforms because the normal vertical distance of ten feet from the mezzanine floor to the platforms was increased to 25 feet in anticipation of the Utica Avenue Line. The existing mezzanine passes over the unused space.|$|E

5|$|The {{existence}} of Mars as a wandering {{object in the}} night sky was recorded by ancient Egyptian astronomers. By the 2nd millennium BCE they were familiar with the apparent retrograde motion of the planet, in which it appears to move in the opposite direction across the sky from its normal progression. Mars was portrayed on <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> the tomb of Seti I, on the Ramesseum ceiling, and in the Senenmut star map. The last is the oldest known star map, being dated to 1534 BCE based on the position of the planets.|$|E

5|$|Burial 7 was interred in a cist {{under the}} central {{chamber of the}} Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49). Although {{it had already been}} looted when it was {{discovered}} by archaeologists, the prior collapse of <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> the summit shrine of the pyramid protected a section of the tomb from the looters. The remains were those of an adult male with an artificially deformed skull; he was laid out on his back with a north-south orientation with the head towards the north. The funerary offering included three polychrome ceramics; a tripod plate, a plate painted with the figure of a dancer and a vessel bearing the images of human figures and a jaguar. Burial 7 was immediately above the cist of Burial 9.|$|E

The middle room has a small window {{to the left of the}} door and a seat recess in its right wall. In the back wall of the middle room to the left is a half cell - which has a seat recess - and a cell with a grooved door. The floor of the cave has a coating of cement, while <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> the middle room bears painted concentric circles.|$|E
5|$|It is {{a popular}} myth that {{so-called}} murder-holes– openings in <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> the gateway passage– were used to pour boiling oil or molten lead on attackers; {{the price of oil}} and lead and the distance of the gatehouse from fires meant that this was impractical. This method was, however, a common practice in the MENA region and the Mediterranean castles and fortifications where such resources were abundant. They were most likely used to drop objects on attackers, or to allow water to be poured on fires to extinguish them. Provision was made in the upper storey of the gatehouse for accommodation so the gate was never left undefended, although this arrangement later evolved to become more comfortable at the expense of defence.|$|E

A real skeleton of a blue whale at the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa was also unveiled in May 2010. The Royal Ontario Museum obtained a blue whale, which died in Newfoundland and Labrador in 2014, and began an exhibition in 2016 to display its skeleton in Toronto.|$|E
5|$|The European Parliament seat {{remained}} an issue throughout this period, despite the Council writing {{it into the}} treaties. During the 1990s, the issue was debated every year and in 1999, 250 MEPs signed a letter condemning the arrangement and the Strasbourg facilities. The following year Parliament voted 401 to 77 for a resolution demanding {{the right to decide}} its own working locations. Attempts to include this in the following treaties in 2000 and 2007 both failed. However, in September 2008 Parliament held its first full plenary session in Brussels after <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> the Strasbourg chamber collapsed during recess forcing the temporary move.|$|E
5|$|The Guests' Hall and its {{adjoining}} Porch Room {{occupy the}} space above {{the entrance to}} the courtyard and the Gatehouse. They can be accessed either through a doorway from the adjacent Prayer Room or via a staircase {{at the south end of}} the courtyard leading to the Long Gallery on the floor above. The first-floor landing leads to a passageway between the Guests' Hall and the Guests' Parlour, and to the garderobe tower visible from the front of the house. A doorway near {{the entrance to the}} Guests' Parlour allows access to the Brew-house Chamber, which is above the Brew-house. The Brew-house Chamber was probably built as servants' quarters, and originally accessed via a hatch in <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> the Brew-house below.|$|E

5|$|The Sundial Room, {{also called}} the Meridian Hall, was once the {{residence}} of Queen Christina of Sweden, then newly converted to Catholicism. The room was further modified by two additions which gave it its current name: a sundial, and a delicate but sophisticated anemoscope which was fixed to <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> the Meridian Hall. These were created by Ignazio Danti, the papal cosmographer, {{in association with the}} Gregorian Calendar Reform. The sundial consisted of a straight line in white marble running across the floor in a north-south direction, intended to measure the height of the Sun at noon according to the seasons of the year.|$|E

After meeting with Paul, Rossi disappears; smears of blood {{on his desk and}} <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> his office are the only traces that remain. Certain that {{something}} unfortunate has befallen his advisor, Paul begins to investigate Dracula. While in the university library he meets a young, dark-haired woman reading a copy of Bram Stoker's Dracula. She is Helen Rossi, the daughter of Bartholomew Rossi, and she has become an expert on Dracula. Paul attempts to convince her that one of the librarians is trying to prevent their research into Dracula, but she is unpersuaded. Later, the librarian attacks and bites Helen. Paul intervenes and overpowers him, but he wriggles free. The librarian is then run over by a car in front of the library and apparently killed.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> the Sistine Chapel {{was to have}} a {{profound}} effect upon other artists, even before it was completed. Vasari, in his Life of Raphael, tells us that Bramante, who had the keys to the chapel, let Raphael in to examine the paintings in Michelangelo's absence. On seeing Michelangelo's prophets, Raphael went back to the picture of the Prophet Isaiah that he was painting on a column in the Church of Sant'Agostino and, according to Vasari, although it was finished, he scraped it off the wall and repainted it in a much more powerful manner, in imitation of Michelangelo. John O'Malley points out that even earlier than the Isaiah is Raphael's inclusion of the figure of Heraclitus in the School of Athens, a brooding figure similar to Michelangelo's Jeremiah, but with the countenace of Michelangelo himself, and leaning on a block of marble.|$|E

5|$|The {{gatehouse}} in the castle's north wall {{is three}} storeys high; now reached by a static bridge, {{it was originally}} connected to the barbican by a drawbridge. The top of the gatehouse is machicolated, and the approach is overlooked by gun-loops in the gatehouse towers. The gatehouse is {{the only part of}} the castle which has gun-loops, and the curtain wall and towers are studded with windows for domestic use rather than military. There are guardrooms on the ground floor and a basement beneath them. The passage would originally have had three wooden portcullises. Above the entrance passage is an arch in the gateway, although it leads nowhere. <b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> the passage through the gatehouse into the castle is vaulted and pierced with murder-holes. Murder-holes were most likely used to drop objects on attackers, similar to machicolations, or to pour water to extinguish fires.|$|E
5|$|The pre-1980 subway {{stations}} of the Bloor–Danforth line follow a two-colour background and trim theme and use the unique Toronto Subway font on the stations' walls. The tiling theme {{was influenced by the}} Broad Street Subway in Philadelphia and used a cycle that was similar to the design employed on the Yonge subway. This design consists of two colours for the tiles, one for main wall tiles and another for trim tiles near <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> the stations. The station names on the main wall tiles use the colour of the trim tiles and vice versa, except that some of the station names of the trim tiles are white instead of the main wall tile colour for readability.|$|E
5|$|To {{give the}} long facade with its two wings of {{contrasting}} architectural styles a uniting, common feature, the third story of oval {{windows of the}} left-hand wings, which was then topped with a Jacobean balustrade was repeated above the Gothic right-hand wing; however, inexplicably the attempt at classical unity was broken by the use castellations instead of a balustrade on the right-hand side. Overall, its length, contrasting styles, high gatehouse and lack of symmetry give the facade a collegiate rather than domestic appearance. The {{focal point of the}} facade, the gatehouse, has multi-faceted turrets at its corners, In 1885, the gatehouse was given a Gothic makeover, which included raising its height and adding the fan vaulting to <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> the passage leading, not to a great base court, as such grandiose architectural feature would suggest, but to a small glazed inner courtyard (the Winter Garden).|$|E
