5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of hepatic encephalopathy is a clinical one, once other causes for confusion or coma have been excluded; no test fully diagnoses or excludes it. Serum ammonia levels are elevated in 90% of people, {{but not all}} hyperammonaemia (high ammonia levels) is associated with encephalopathy. A CT scan of the brain usually shows no abnormality except in stage IV encephalopathy, when cerebral oedema may be visible. Other neuroimaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are not currently regarded as useful, although they may show abnormalities. Electroencephalography shows no clear abnormalities in stage 0, even if minimal HE is present; in stages I, II and III there are <b>triphasic</b> waves over the frontal lobes that oscillate at 5Hz, and in stage IV there is slow delta wave activity. However, the changes in EEG are not typical enough to be useful in distinguishing hepatic encephalopathy from other conditions.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} found that the most {{effective}} method of hormonal contraception is with a combination of an estrogen and a progestin. This can be done in a monophasic, biphasic, or <b>triphasic</b> manner. In the monophasic method, both an estrogen and a progestin are administered for 20 or 21 days and stopped for a 7- or 8-day period that includes the 5-day menstrual period. Sometimes, a 28-day regimen that includes 6 or 7 inert tablets is used. Newer biphasic and <b>triphasic</b> methods are now used to more closely simulate the normal menstrual cycle. Yet another method is to administer a small dose of progestin only (no estrogen) in order to decrease certain risks associated with administering estrogen, but a major side-effect is irregular bleeding usually observed during the first 18 months of such therapy.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, British {{cardiologist}} Sir Thomas Lewis researched mechanical abrasion to the skin. The skin demonstrated a <b>triphasic</b> response. First, a red spot develops and spreads outward {{due to the}} release of histamine from mast cells. Secondly, a brighter red color spread around the original spot due to arteriolar dilation. The last phase was the production of a wheal filled fluid over the original spot. Lewis believed that the skin’s response was due to the dilation of neighboring blood vessels that were triggered by the nervous system through the axon reflex. This <b>triphasic</b> response was named the triple response of Lewis. The dilation of arterioles in the effected area is due to vasodilation. Although Lewis observed vasodilation that could be explained by axon reflex, there was not yet direct evidence explaining the branching of nerves from the center of an axon rather than a cell body or which chemical agents were responsible for the goose bump, red line, and dilated blood vessel symptoms.|$|E
5000|$|CB1 receptors are {{expressed}} throughout the basal ganglia and have well-established effects on movement in rodents. As in the hippocampus, these receptors inhibit {{the release of}} glutamate or GABA transmitter, resulting in decreased excitation or reduced inhibition based on the cell they {{are expressed}} in. Consistent with the variable expression of both excitatory glutamate and inhibitory GABA interneurons in both the basal ganglia's direct and indirect motor loops, synthetic cannabinoids are known to influence this system in a dose-dependent <b>triphasic</b> pattern. Decreased locomotor activity is seen at both higher and lower concentrations of applied cannabinoids, whereas an enhancement of movement may occur upon moderate dosages. [...] However, these dose-dependent effects have been studied predominately in rodents, and the physiological basis for this <b>triphasic</b> pattern warrants future research in humans. Effects may vary based {{on the site of}} cannabinoid application, input from higher cortical centers, and whether drug application is unilateral or bilateral.|$|E

50|$|Thus, {{the steam}} would {{travel in the}} tubes at high {{pressure}} (38 kg/cm²) to the generating sets, where the turbine would transform the steam’s thermal energy into mechanical energy, and the alternator would transform the mechanical energy it received from the turbine into electric power, producing a 10.500 V <b>triphasic</b> electric current with a 50 Hz frequency, which after passing through the plant’s substation, was distributed among consumers.|$|E

The alternator’s excitation current was supplied by the exciter, a continuous current generator joined directly to the general base that, at full charge, had 170 Volts CC with a 340 Amp intensity.|$|E
50|$|The psychoactive {{effects of}} {{cannabis}} {{are known to}} have a <b>triphasic</b> nature. Primary psychoactive effects include a state of relaxation, and to a lesser degree, euphoria from its main psychoactive compound, tetrahydrocannabinol. Secondary psychoactive effects, such as a facility for philosophical thinking, introspection and metacognition have been reported among cases of anxiety and paranoia. Finally, the tertiary psychoactive effects of the drug cannabis, can include an increase in heart rate and hunger, believed to be caused by 11-OH-THC, a psychoactive metabolite of THC produced in the liver.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} poly-leucine catalysts {{were formed}} by reacting leucine-N-carboxyanhydrides with an initiator {{such as an}} amine, an alcohol or water (Figure 5). In <b>triphasic</b> systems, the polymer catalyst must be soaked in the organic solvent and peroxide solution to generate a gel prior to reaction.-Especially in biphasic systems, reaction time may be reduced and enantioselectivity increased by activating the catalyst with NaOH prior to reaction. Furthermore, in biphasic systems the polymer may be immobilized on polystyrene, polyethylene glycol (PEG), or silica gel and formed into a paste.|$|E
5000|$|The muscle {{contraction}} of a ballistic muscle movement can exhibit a muscle coactivation of concurrent agonist [...] and antagonist muscles or the characteristic <b>triphasic</b> agonist/antagonist/agonist muscle activation. Electromyography (EMG) recordings of demonstrate the <b>triphasic</b> muscle activation {{begins with a}} brief agonist motor unit activation signal with firing rates of 60 to 120 Hz that may last for 100ms and occurs 50 to 100ms before movement begins. The firing rates of ballistic movements are much {{higher than that of}} slow ramp movements (5-15 Hz). The brief agonist muscle contraction is thus followed by antagonist muscle unit activation. The degree of antagonist muscle unit activation is dependent on the task at hand unlike the first agonist muscle activation which is independent to environmental stimuli. The function of the antagonist muscle contraction is believed to control the amplitude and timing of ballistic movements. Antagonist muscle contraction may serve to prevent injury to joints by preventing the limb from overextending itself and also function to control the distance and time the limb is being moved. Experiments involving ballistic movement of small amplitudes show a marked increase in antagonist muscle activation and experiments where distance moved is not controlled antagonist muscle activation was decreased or absent. The second agonist muscle activation is suggested to terminate the negative acceleration of the antagonist muscle contraction and thus the ballistic movement.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the large}} {{molecular}} weight of echinocandins, they have poor oral bioavailability and are administered by intravenous infusion. In addition, their large structures limit penetration into cerebrospinal fluid, urine, and eyes. In plasma, echinocandins have a high affinity to serum proteins. Echinocandins do not have primary interactions with CYP450 or P-glycoprotein pumps. Caspofungin has <b>triphasic</b> nonlinear pharmacokinetics, while micafungin (hepatically metabolized by arylsulfatase, catechol O-methyltransferase, and hydroxylation) and anidulafungin (degraded spontaneously {{in the system and}} excreted mostly as a metabolite in the urine) have linear elimination. Younger patients exhibit a faster rate of elimination of micafungin and caspofungin.|$|E

While extracellular somatic action potentials {{have been used to}} study cellular activity in freely moving animals such as place cells, axonal activity in both white and gray matter can also be recorded. Extracellular {{recordings of}} axon action potential propagation is distinct from somatic action potentials in three ways: 1. The signal has a shorter peak-trough duration (~150μs) than of pyramidal cells (~500μs) or interneurons (~250μs). 2. The voltage change is <b>triphasic.</b> 3. Activity recorded on a tetrode is seen on only one of the four recording wires. In recordings from freely moving rats, axonal signals have been isolated in white matter tracts including the alveus and the corpus callosum as well hippocampal gray matter.|$|E
5000|$|Curran {{has also}} pioneered {{many aspects of}} the {{relatively}} young field of fluorous chemistry.

[...] Curran introduced light fluorous reactions, fluorous <b>triphasic</b> reactions, fluorous phase vanishing reactions (with Ilyhong Ryu) and fluorous mixture synthesis (or FMS). FMS is the first example of solution phase synthesis with separation tagging, and it has been used to make many analogs and stereoisomers of complex natural products. The techniques of FMS allow 4-16 analogs or isomers to be made in a single synthesis.Curran also introduced fluorous solid phase extraction, a simple separation technique that enabled much subsequent work. The high resolution version of the technique, fluorous chromatography, is the basis of FMS.|$|E

5000|$|The {{life-cycle}} of the {{red algae}} has three stages (<b>triphasic).</b> In Polysiphonia it consists of a sequence of a gametangial, carpospoangial and tetrasporangial phases. [...] Male (haploid) plants (the male gametophytes) produce spermatia and the female plants (the female gametophytes) produce the carpogonium (the haploid carpogonium) which remains attached to the parent female plant. After fertilization the diploid nucleus migrates and fuses with an auxiliary cell. A complex series of fusions and developments follow as the diploid zygote develops to become the carposporophyte, this is a separate phase of the life-cycle and is entirely parasitic on the female, it is surrounded by the haploid pericarp of the parent female plant. The diploid carpospores produced in the carposporangium when released are non-motile, they settle and grow to form filamentous diploid plants similar to the gametophyte. This diploid plant is the tetrasporophyte which when adult produced spores in fours after meiosis. These spores settle and grow to become {{the male and female}} plants thus completing the cycle.|$|E
50|$|In human, {{ballistic}} movements involve spontaneous propulsion of the limbs. This {{can be seen}} {{in daily}} routines such as reach and strike reactions, which are atomic by nature. Pointing gestures and placing an object are reach reactions; they have low acceleration and deceleration. On the other hand, punching and throwing are strike reactions; they are characterized by high acceleration and deceleration. These movements have highly variable target locations, and they are referred to as “ballistic” in psychokinesiology. During ballistic movement an initial impulse is needed to accelerate the limb (hand/foot) toward the target, then a decelerating impulse act as a brake to stop the movement. These movements are characterized by a bell-shaped velocity profile. The Bayesian Model(see Bayesian network), which was developed to perform recognition without pose-tracking, explains human ballistic movement as a sequence of movements between objects and the environment. Each movement is independent from precedent and subsequent one, in varying context. Fast single joints movement in humans is controlled by a series of activation of agonist, antagonist and then agonist muscles; this process is called <b>triphasic</b> activation. Those movements are executed “with a pattern of bursts in the agonist and antagonist muscles of fairly constant duration but different amplitude…” (Acornero et al. 1984). Any ballistic movement involving two joints will require an agonist and an antagonist burst; this can be viewed as the building blocks for different types of ballistic movements.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} if staging of {{renal cell carcinoma}} (RCC) can be predicted from preoperative <b>triphasic</b> helical computed tomography (CT) findings. Patients and methodsWe reviewed the <b>triphasic</b> helical CT scans of 48 consecutive patients with pathologic diagnosis RCCs. All tumors were staged according to the 2002 version of TNM staging system. The preoperative radiologic staging was compared with postoperative pathologic staging. Agreement between the two staging systems was determined using the kappa test. ResultsComparison between <b>triphasic</b> helical CT staging and pathologic staging showed harmony in all lesions in stage T 1 a, and T 1 b. <b>Triphasic</b> helical CT over diagnosed two cases of stage T 1 b regarded as stage T 3 a while agreement was noted in all cases of stage T 2. Harmony was noted between <b>triphasic</b> helical CT and pathologic staging in two lesions stage T 3 a, four lesions in stage T 3 b, and two lesions stage T 4. The agreement between <b>triphasic</b> helical CT and pathologic T stages was perfect (K= 0. 941). Forty-two cases were staged N 0, one case was N 1, and five cases were staged N 2 by <b>triphasic</b> CT. Three cases were over staged, and six cases were under staged while, 39 were correctly N staged. The agreement between <b>triphasic</b> helical CT and pathologic N staging was poor (K= 0. 33). ConclusionThe agreement between the preoperative <b>triphasic</b> helical CT staging and postoperative pathologic T staging is perfect, while agreement in N stages is poor. So T staging of RCC can be predicted from <b>triphasic</b> helical CT findings while N staging cannot be predicted preoperatively...|$|E
