5|$|Opponents {{to suicide}} include Christian {{philosophers}} such as Augustine of Hippo, Thomas Aquinas, Immanuel Kant and, arguably, John Stuart Mill – Mill's {{focus on the}} importance of liberty and autonomy meant that he rejected choices which would prevent a person from making future autonomous decisions. Others view suicide as a legitimate matter of personal choice. Supporters of this position maintain <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> be forced to suffer against their will, particularly from conditions such as incurable disease, mental illness, and old age, with no possibility of improvement. They reject the belief that suicide is always irrational, arguing instead that it can be a valid last resort for those enduring major pain or trauma. A stronger stance would argue that people should be allowed to autonomously choose to die regardless of whether they are suffering. Notable supporters of this school of thought include Scottish empiricist David Hume and American bioethicist Jacob Appel.|$|E
5|$|The Nez Perce band {{associated}} with Chief Joseph, numbering about 750 people, passed through Yellowstone National Park in thirteen days during late August 1877. They were {{being pursued by}} the U.S.Army and entered the national park about {{two weeks after the}} Battle of the Big Hole. Some of the Nez Perce were friendly to the tourists and other people they encountered in the park; some were not. Nine park visitors were briefly taken captive. Despite Joseph and other chiefs ordering <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> be harmed, at least two people were killed and several wounded. One of the areas where encounters occurred was in Lower Geyser Basin and east along a branch of the Firehole River to Mary Mountain and beyond. That stream is still known as Nez Perce Creek. A group of Bannocks entered the park in 1878, alarming park Superintendent Philetus Norris. In the aftermath of the Sheepeater Indian War of 1879, Norris built a fort to prevent Native Americans from entering the national park.|$|E

25|$|Narraboth gazes from {{a terrace}} in Herod's palace into the banquet hall at the {{beautiful}} Princess Salome; {{he is in}} love with her, and apotheosizes her, much to the disgusted fearfulness of the Page of Herodias. The voice of the Prophet Jochanaan is heard from his prison in the palace cistern; Herod fears him and has ordered <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> contact him, including Jerusalem's High Priest.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the twin}} {{elements}} of natural justice is the rule against bias or nemo iudex in causa sua, which means <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> be a judge {{in his or her}} own cause. The rule ensures that decision-makers will not be biased or prejudiced in a way that precludes a genuine and fair consideration of the arguments or evidence presented by the parties. Bias may be actual, imputed or apparent.|$|E
25|$|Comanche raids before 1840 had {{generally}} penetrated only a {{short distance}} south of the Rio Grande and had usually resulted {{in only a few}} deaths and the theft of a few thousand livestock. The threat, however, from the Comanche was serious enough in 1826 in northern Nuevo León, that the Governor issued orders <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> venture out of villages into the countryside except in groups of at least thirty armed men.|$|E

25|$|Chilean {{software}} engineer Jorge Arellano Cid conceived the Dillo project in late 1999, publishing {{the first version}} of Dillo in December of that year. His primary goal in creating Dillo was to democratize access to information. Arellano Cid believed <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> have to buy a new computer or pay for broadband in order to enjoy the World Wide Web. To this end, he designed Dillo to be small, fast, and efficient, capable of performing well even on an Intel 80486 CPU with a dial-up Internet access.|$|E
25|$|Health issues {{regarding}} Kingman Lake again became {{prominent in the}} mid-1950s. An American University biologist found that the bed of Kingman Lake was composed almost entirely of fecal matter, and warned <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> swim in the lake due the extensive pollution. The immense amount of raw sewage in the lake was attributed to low water flows, {{and the lack of}} southern locks to allow water to more freely pass out of the lake. Nonetheless, a year later city officials were advocating that a playground be built on the shores of Kingman Island.|$|E
25|$|According to Exodus, Shabbat (Sabbath) was reinstituted {{the first}} week manna appeared. It states that twice as much manna as usual was {{available}} on the sixth morning of the week, and none at all could {{be found on the}} seventh day; although manna usually rotted and became maggot-infested after a single night, that which had been collected on the sixth day remained fresh until the second night. Moses stated that the double portion of Preparation Day was to be consumed on Shabbat; and that God instructed him <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> leave his place on Shabbat, so that the people could rest during it.|$|E
5000|$|During the 2014 {{military}} operation in Gaza, Feiglin criticized lawmaker Aliza Lavie for discussing legislation on sexual violence, protesting <b>that</b> in wartime, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> be [...] "talking {{about things like}} flowers and sexual assault".|$|R

Do you, however, see to this. I would rather <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>should</b> be told." ...|$|R
25|$|Ebroin endeavoured to {{maintain}} {{at any rate}} the union of Neustria and Burgundy, but the great Burgundian nobles too wished to remain independent. They rose under bishop Leodegar (or Léger) of Autun, and defeated Ebroin and Theuderic. They decided to tonsure Ebroin, interning him in the monastery of Luxeuil. A proclamation was then issued {{to the effect that}} each kingdom should keep its own laws and customs, {{that there should be no}} further interchange of functionaries between the kingdoms, and <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> again set up a tyranny like that of Ebroin. Soon, however, Leodegar too was defeated by Wulfoald and the Austrasians, and was himself confined at Luxeuil in 673.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} end of Robespierre, a new royalist social movement, called the Muscadins had appeared. These were largely upper middle class young men, {{numbering}} between and two and three thousand, who dressed in an extravagant fashion, spoke with an exaggerated accent, carried canes as weapons, and, particularly in 1794 and 1795, they patrolled the streets in groups and attacked sans culottes and symbols of the revolution. They tried to be and act like the nobility of the Ancien Regime, and mostly tried to live in the abandoned Marais area. One of the most extreme of the revolutionaries, Marat, the editor of the radical newspaper L'Ami du people ("Friend of the people") had been assassinated on 13 July 1793, and on 22 September 1794, his ashes had been placed with great ceremony in the Pantheon, alongside those of Voltaire and Rousseau. After the downfall of Robespierre, the Convention issued a decree <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> be entered in the Pantheon who had not been dead for ten years. The Muscadins went even further, invading the Pantheon, destroying Marat's monument and removing his ashes.|$|E
500|$|..... {{it seems}} that it happens in the lordships and states of earthly dignitaries, that as they are at their highest peak, so {{presently}} does their decline and ruin follow, and not without the providence of divine justice, in order to punish sins and so <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> place his trust in fallacious good fortune.|$|E
60|$|It was {{comfortable}} {{to hear the}} deep breathings of the weary servant, and to sit by that little cot, sensible of being for once of substantial use, and meaning <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> ever <b>should</b> know it. But she was again disconcerted; for the stairs creaked, the door was softly opened, and Arthur stood on the threshold. The colour mantled into her face, {{as if she had}} been doing wrong.|$|R
6000|$|... "You know I {{promised to}} let bygones be bygones, eh? Well, I {{intended}} it, and more,--I {{intended to make}} 'em so.

But the cards are out of my hands; the game's been played without me. For he's dead!" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{faithful}} servant, however, {{told the}} queen {{that it was}} the king's command that during the years he was absent in the war she should keep herself concealed in the castle, so <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> but himself <b>should</b> see her and the little princes.|$|R
500|$|During the 2008 presidential campaign, Affleck {{expressed}} concerns about conspiracy theories claiming Barack Obama was an Arab or a Muslim: [...] "This prejudice {{that we have}} allowed to fester in this campaign ... the acceptance of both of those things as a legitimate slur is really a problem." [...] In 2012, he praised Senator John McCain's leadership in defending Huma Abedin against anti-Muslim attacks. Affleck engaged in {{a discussion about the}} relationship between liberal principles and Islam during a 2014 appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher. In a 2017 Guardian interview, he said: [...] "I strongly believe <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> be stereotyped {{on the basis of their}} race or religion. It’s one of the most fundamental tenets of liberal thought." ...|$|E
500|$|Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey {{has been}} widely lauded for its {{innovation}} and theming. Arthur Levine of About.com stated that he felt he [...] "had been taken to a truly magical place. For a few glorious moments, the Floo Network, flying benches, and willows that whomp seemed not just possible, but actual." [...] He gave the ride a rating of 5 stars out of 5, and wrote that the ride {{was the best of}} its kind. Robert Niles of Theme Park Insider commended Universal Creative for its attention to detail on the ride. Niles wrote that the company had set its expectations almost impossibly high, and that the ride is [...] "the most advanced and engaging attraction in theme park industry history". Ricky Brigante of Inside the Magic described the ride as a [...] "jaw-dropping journey <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> miss", but criticized the lack of continuity with the story.|$|E
500|$|Members of the Indian {{parliament}} demanded severe {{punishment for}} the perpetrators. The then Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Sushma Swaraj, stated: [...] "The rapists should be hanged". Sonia Gandhi visited the Safdarjang Hospital and met doctors on duty in the anaesthesia and surgery departments for {{an update on the}} woman's health. Bahujan Samaj Party chief, Mayawati, said that proper investigation was required, and that [...] "action should be so strict <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> dare to act in such a manner again". Actress and member of the Rajya Sabha, Jaya Bachchan said that she was [...] "terribly disturbed" [...] over the incident, and felt [...] "ashamed" [...] sitting in the House, feeling [...] "helpless" [...] for [...] "not being able to do anything". Meira Kumar, Speaker of the Lok Sabha, told reporters a [...] "new law should be brought in and must get passed {{to ensure the safety of}} women."

5000|$|In 1168 {{the monks}} of St Augustine's {{complained to the}} papacy that Clarembald was {{allowing}} infants and small children to become monks of their abbey. The monks were given a papal ruling <b>that</b> stated <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> be allowed to become a monk younger than age 15. The next year Clarembald was the sole supporter of a royal effort to remove England from papal and archiepiscopal authority. Clarembald was appointed to conduct the sheriff's inquest of 1170 in Kent and other southern counties.|$|R

60|$|Now {{this strange}} {{friendship}} was observed by the Tanuki, a wicked, quarrelsome beast, who hated the peasant, {{and was never}} tired of doing him an ill turn. Again and again he had crept to the hut, and finding some choice morsel put away for the little hare, had either eaten it if he thought it nice, or trampled it to pieces so <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>should</b> get it, and at last the peasant lost patience, and {{made up his mind}} he would have the Tanuki's blood.|$|R
500|$|Rinder {{told the}} Tampa Bay Times that interrogations [...] "would {{be carried out}} by whoever {{happened}} to be there– 20 people, 30 people, 50 people, all standing up and screaming at you, and ultimately it sort of devolved into physical violence, torture, to extricate these 'confessions' out of people." [...] According to Rinder, the confessions were sometimes dictated by Miscavige, but more usually the inmates of the Hole would force each other to confess: [...] "The 50 people there are all screaming at me, telling me I've got to confess– I've done that, why don't I just admit it? I stole money, I had affairs– people would just literally dream up bullshit and start screaming it out, and then the mob goes crazy: 'Oh yeah, it must have been that!'" [...] Tom De Vocht, who was also in the Hole, recalled that [...] "everybody in that damned room— people are wild and out of control, I punched somebody. Everybody was punched. And screaming and yelling. It just got like, 'What {{the hell is going on}} here?'" [...] De Vocht rationalized his own involvement on the grounds of self-defense: [...] "If I don't attack I'm going to be attacked. It's a survival instinct in a weird situation <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> be in." ...|$|E
500|$|Shaw's {{views on}} {{religion}} and Christianity were less consistent. Having in his youth proclaimed himself an atheist, in middle age he explained this as a reaction against the Old Testament image of a vengeful Jehovah. By the early twentieth century, he termed himself a [...] "mystic", although Gary Sloan, in an essay on Shaw's beliefs, disputes his credentials as such. In 1913 Shaw declared {{that he was not}} religious [...] "in the sectarian sense", aligning himself with Jesus as [...] "a person of no religion". In the preface (1915) to Androcles and the Lion, Shaw asks [...] "Why not give Christianity a chance?" [...] contending that Britain's social order resulted from the continuing choice of Barabbas over Christ. In a broadcast just before the Second World War, Shaw invoked the Sermon on the Mount, [...] "a very moving exhortation, and it gives you one first-rate tip, which is to do good to those who despitefully use you and persecute you". In his will, Shaw stated that his [...] "religious convictions and scientific views cannot at present be more specifically defined than as those of a believer in creative revolution". He requested <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> imply that he accepted the beliefs of any specific religious organisation, and that no memorial to him should [...] "take the form of a cross or any other instrument of torture or symbol of blood sacrifice".|$|E

UCC safety regulations specified <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> tank <b>should</b> be filled more than 50% (here, 30 tons) with liquid MIC. Each tank was pressurized with inert nitrogen gas. This pressurization allowed liquid MIC to be pumped out of each tank as needed, and also kept impurities out of the tanks.|$|R
5000|$|The Dark Knight, the 2008 summer {{blockbuster}} {{delved into}} whether the public security against the Joker's actions warranted Batman's mass scale spying on Gotham City's citizens using cell phone technology. Lucius Fox, Morgan Freeman's character, threatened to quit Wayne Enterprises over Batman's private surveillance of Gotham claiming <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> man <b>should</b> possess such power. However {{the hero of}} the movie, Batman, claimed that mass surveillance of citizens was vital to fight [...] "terrorism".

He acquiesced, with the injunction <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>should</b> fire. Sergeant McKinnery slipped a shell into his rifle, adjusted the sights for one thousand yards, and fired. The shell fell short. Then he put in another, raised the sights for another one thousand yards, took careful aim, and let her go. The officer on the white horse threw up his arms and fell forward.|$|R
