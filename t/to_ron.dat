Brabham investigated other chassis suppliers for BRO, however the two reached an agreement and from 1966 MRD was much more closely involved in this category. After Jack Brabham sold his shares in MRD <b>to</b> <b>Ron</b> Tauranac at the end of 1969, the works Formula One team was MRD.|$|E

5|$|Voldemort triumphantly announces Harry's {{apparent}} {{death to}} everyone at Hogwarts, and demands {{that they all}} surrender. As Neville gives a defiant response and draws the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat, Harry reveals he is still alive, causing the Malfoys and many other Death Eaters to abandon Voldemort as they realize he failed to kill Harry again, and any hope of victory for the Dark Lord is now a lost cause. While Harry battles Voldemort throughout the castle, Neville kills Nagini with the sword, leaving Voldemort vulnerable, and Molly Weasley kills Bellatrix in the Great Hall. Harry and Voldemort's battle ends with Voldemort's own Killing Curse rebounding and killing him, once and for all. After the battle, Harry explains <b>to</b> <b>Ron</b> and Hermione that the Elder Wand had recognised him as its true master because he had disarmed Draco, who earlier had disarmed its previous owner — Dumbledore — but, instead of claiming the Elder Wand, Harry breaks and discards it.|$|E
