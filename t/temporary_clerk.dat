5|$|On leaving school, Headley was {{appointed}} as a <b>temporary</b> <b>clerk</b> in a magistrate's court; this {{enabled him to}} play competitive cricket for the St Andrew's Police side in 1926, in a cup competition. Some impressive performances for the club earned him an invitation to practice with the Jamaica Colts team. However, his job {{made it impossible to}} attend, and he was not considered for the Jamaican side against Lord Tennyson's English touring side in 1927. That year, Headley began working for Keeling–Lindo Estates, in St Catherine. The firm were enthusiastic cricket patrons, allowing employees time off to play in matches, so that Headley was able to attend practice with the Jamaica team on a regular basis. He also moved to the St Catherine Cricket Club, captained by his immediate superior in Keeling–Lindo. To generate more income, Headley took a second job, working for the Jamaica Fruit and Shipping Company, but he wanted a secure profession. To this end, he planned to move to America to pursue a career in dentistry. However, he was now on the verge of the Jamaica team and a delay in the arrival of the application forms for his American work permit allowed him to make his first-class debut for Jamaica against another touring team led by Lord Tennyson.|$|E

500|$|O'Reilly {{was hired}} by the United States Bureau of the Mint as a Class D <b>temporary</b> <b>clerk</b> in 1904, when she was 38 years old, older than most new employees. She served in the Washington, D.C. {{headquarters}} of the Bureau of the Mint, where Mint Director George E. Roberts was impressed by her business experience and competence. [...] Initially having only temporary status, she was made a permanent employee in 1905, and was promoted again that year to Clerk Class I at a salary of $1,200. When Margaret Kelly was commissioned Examiner of the Bureau of the Mint in 1911, the ripple of promotions in her wake included O'Reilly, who became adjuster of accounts. [...] This made her in effect the chief clerk of the Mint Bureau, with responsibility for reviewing all contracts. According to Teva J. Scheer, biographer of Nellie Tayloe Ross (O'Reilly's final Mint Director before retirement) [...] "it must have required an almost unprecedented combination of drive and intelligence for [...] to have climbed so far up through the organization in her male-dominated work environment".|$|E

5000|$|Scott {{wanted to}} be a doctor, but family {{finances}} were precarious, so in 1879 he joined the federal civil service. As the story goes, William Scott might not have money but he had connections in high places. Among his acquaintances was the prime minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, who agreed to meet with Duncan. As chance would have it, when Duncan arrived for his interview, the prime minister had a memo on his desk from the Indian Branch of the Department of the Interior asking for a <b>temporary</b> copying <b>clerk.</b> Making a quick decision while the serious young applicant waited in front of him, Macdonald wrote across the request: 'Approved.

The session adjourned after electing <b>temporary</b> speaker, <b>clerk,</b> etc. Bradley felt so alien to it all that he {{scarcely}} took the trouble to vote; and when the committee on credentials was appointed, he felt nervously in his pocket to see that his papers were safe.

2500|$|In the nation's early days, {{with a small}} {{population}} and {{before the advent of}} powered transportation and modern telecommunications, there was little need for statistics nor ability to create them. In the colonial years, sometimes magistrates and police officials collected data as part of their work. After about the 1890s, the official information source presented to the public was called the New Zealand Official Yearbook compiled from various departments. Sometimes data about animals were collected (a census of poultry ceased in 1971); one census taker on horseback drowned while crossing a river. In 1956, the newly created Department of Statistics had 164 employees. Tabulating techniques improved. One source writes: [...] "As both New Zealand's {{population and}} the complexity of the information sought grew, so did the size of the army of <b>temporary</b> <b>clerks</b> that was employed every five years by the Census and Statistics Office to process it. Sitting at long tables in large draughty or cramped rooms, they laboriously added, subtracted and calculated percentages. From the 1890s census data was written on cards which were sorted by hand. The drudgery of statistical work was gradually eased as adding and calculating machines and typewriters came into use, operated mostly by women. Tabulating machines were imported from the United States in the 1920s to process punched cards; this too was women's work," [...] according to a book written by David Green in 2002. The agency grew in size. Tabulating machines were replaced by mainframe computers, then microcomputers, then the Internet. [...] "Since the early 1980s computing has been done in-house, and in the 1990s personal computers and the Internet revolutionised the day-to-day experience of work at Statistics New Zealand," [...] according to Green's book.|$|R
50|$|Rankin {{originally}} {{joined the}} Department of Social Welfare (as {{it was then}} called) in 1978 as a <b>temporary</b> <b>clerk,</b> following the break-up of her first marriage. Rising through the ranks, she became {{the head of the}} Department in 1998. Her time as head of the Department occasioned some controversy, with allegations of extravagant spending and of a management style akin to a personality cult. In 2001 she lost a high-profile Employment Court case after the Labour government decided not to renew her contract. She has since worked as a consultant and public speaker.|$|E
5000|$|In Sydney Gibson {{pursued a}} career in the Lands Department {{initially}} as a <b>temporary</b> <b>clerk</b> in June 1876. He was later appointed to the permanent staff on 1 January 1877, a job that allowed him to tour the Outback and regional areas of the colony and gain a strong impression of the culture and characters of the Bush.

50|$|Moran {{first visited}} England in 1851.

From 1857, he kept a private diary which was subsequently published; the diary is of interest mainly because it documents how the US Civil War was seen in the UK.|$|E

5000|$|According to Highsmith, {{the novel}} was {{inspired}} by a blonde woman in a mink coat who ordered a doll from her while Highsmith was working as a <b>temporary</b> sales <b>clerk</b> in the toy section of Bloomingdale's in New York City during Christmas season of 1948: Perhaps I noticed her because she was alone, or because a mink coat was a rarity, and because she was blondish and seemed to give off light. With the same thoughtful air, she purchased a doll, one of two or three I had shown her, and I wrote her name and address on the receipt, because the doll was to be delivered to an adjacent state. It was a routine transaction, the woman paid and departed. But I felt odd and swimmy in the head, near to fainting, {{yet at the same time}} uplifted, as if I had seen a vision.As usual, I went home after work to my apartment, where I lived alone. That evening I wrote out an idea, a plot, a story about the blondish and elegant woman in the fur coat. I wrote some eight pages in longhand in my then-current notebook or cahier.|$|R
