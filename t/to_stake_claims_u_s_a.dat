50|$|The {{fragmentation}} of the collectively owned tribal lands was followed in April 1889 by the first and largest {{of a series of}} officially sanctioned Oklahoma land runs, in which prospective settlers rushed <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> parcels previously part of the Unassigned Lands. Oklahoma became the new Kansas — a bustling, hardscrabble, agrarian frontier economy emerged, with Oklahoma City the nexus of the Oklahoma Colony.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{permanent}} European settler was Joseph Sous Enas, who <b>staked</b> a homestead <b>claim</b> on land {{south of}} the present city. It then became a railroad station on the route between Monte Cristo (now a ghost town) and Everett. The city was officially incorporated on December 21, 1903. He was quickly followed by other homesteaders, benefiting from [...] "the Big Burn", a forest fire that cleared the heavily forested land and {{made it easier for}} settlers <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> <b>claims.</b>|$|R

50|$|As if Olieslagers' poor {{record of}} {{approvals}} {{was not sufficient}} to keep his score low, he also habitually took the fight to the Germans and was indifferent to the paperwork <b>to</b> <b>staking</b> <b>claims.</b> Although he submitted one combat report on 30 March 1916 for a witnessed triumph behind enemy lines, which went unverified for lack of an officer's confirmation, he usually did not bother with claims for wins behind the German lines.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 1896, George Carmack walked into the Forty Mile Creek Saloon and paid for his drink with gold nuggets. CJ felt Carmack's story was {{credible}} and left immediately with his brother Fred <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> <b>claims.</b> CJ and Fred, staying very close to shore in their small boat, pushed themselves upriver with [...] "poles" [...] slowly but surely against the mighty Yukon River current. It was hard work, but the Berry brothers made the 50 mi journey upstream to the claims within a few days.|$|R
50|$|For {{much of the}} 17th century, North Stonington was thinly {{populated}} by the Pequots and European settlers. Starting in the 1630s and 1640s, the English established coastline settlements in Wequetequock, which is now Old Mystic, and Pawcatuck. However, the pressure of a growing population and continued immigration in succeeding decades caused homesteading to steadily push northward. The end of hostilities following King Philip's War of 1676 and a partial resolution of border disputes among Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts colonies also encouraged enterprising pioneers to move inland <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> <b>claims.</b>|$|R
50|$|About {{five years}} after European-American {{settlers}} established Whitman County on November 29, 1871, Bolin Farr arrived here, camping in 1876 at the confluence of Dry Flat Creek and Missouri Flat Creek, {{on the bank of}} the Palouse River.

Copper {{deposits}} were first discovered in this area in 1898 as Gold Rush Stampeders were making their way to Dawson. Because of the Gold Rush, most people overlooked the outcroppings of copper {{on their way to the}} Klondike. However, a few men did choose to stay in Whitehorse <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> <b>claims.</b> Some of these more notable individuals were John McIntyre, William P. Grainger, John Hanly, Andrew Olsen, Ole Dickson, H.E. Porter and Sam McGee.|$|R
50|$|Indra {{opens in}} a village in Andhra Pradesh showing the rivalry between two families. A police officer (Narra Venkateswara Rao) wishing to end this hostility comes up with the {{proposal}} of marriage between the two families which ultimately is used by Veera Siva Reddy as a trap to finish off his rival brothers, Bharatasimha Reddy and Vijayasimha Reddy.

5000|$|Because {{public land}} {{available}} for distribution is now quite limited, {{most of the}} land will need to come from private sectors. [...] "To get a share of land, therefore, it is critical for women <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> a <b>claim</b> in privatised land".|$|R
25|$|Anticipating a confrontation, legislators began <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> key {{physical}} {{positions on}} the stage of the Legislative Palace in the days leading to December 1.

Later in the week, the impasse appeared to take a less hostile tone.

60|$|A {{year before}} Dawson City had been unknown, but the rich finds of gold on Bonanza and Gold Bottom creeks {{had caused the}} miners to leave Circle City and Forty Mile Post and boom the new El Dorado, as it was termed, and the {{settlement}} grew as if by magic. From the wild rush <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> <b>claims</b> many rows resulted, but the cooler heads speedily took matters in hand, and each man was allowed a claim from five to fifteen hundred feet long and extending {{the width of the}} creek or gulch in which it was located.|$|R
50|$|Their {{separate}} explorations did {{not diminish}} their collective chemistry.

500|$|When Barnette and the Isabelles crew {{heard of}} Pedro's discovery, they {{immediately}} fled {{the boat and}} the settlement <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> <b>claims</b> on creeks and likely gold-bearing spots [...] north, near the mountain and creek Pedro named after himself. Marking a claim was simple. Each man could pick a set amount of space, which was marked with posts at each corner, hence [...] "staking" [...] the claim. Each claim had to be listed by a federal recorder. When Barnette and {{the crew of the}} Isabelle were <b>staking</b> <b>claims,</b> Barnette proclaimed himself the interim recorder until an official one could be brought to the area. Although they also recorded their claims with Barnette, most men also reported their claims at the official office in Circle. To maximize his gain, Barnette had power of attorney for several relatives in Ohio. He <b>staked</b> <b>claims</b> in their names, thus giving him authority over a large portion of what was believed to be the gold-bearing terrain.|$|R

50|$|By 1849, gold-seekers {{wishing to}} get <b>to</b> California <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> <b>claims</b> were {{arriving}} in Texas {{and looking for}} opportunities to travel west. Brevet Major General William J. Worth ordered Lieutenant William H.C. Whiting and Lieutenant William Farrar Smith to find a suitable route to El Paso.

From there, they headed east to San Antonio.|$|R
