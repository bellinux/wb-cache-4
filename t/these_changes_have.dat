5|$|Argentina is {{vulnerable}} {{and will likely}} be significantly impacted by climate change. Temperatures have increased {{in the last century}} while the observed changes in precipitation are variable, with some areas receiving more and other areas less. <b>These</b> <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> impacted river flow, increased the frequency of extreme weather events, and led to the retreat of glaciers. Based on the projections for both precipitation and temperatures, these climatic events are likely to increase in severity and create new problems associated with climate change in the country.|$|E

The data that has been provided on gene expression in the brain has fuelled further research {{into a number of}} disorders. The long term use of alcohol for example, has shown altered gene expression in the brain, and cell-type specific changes that may relate to alcohol use disorder. <b>These</b> <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> been noted in the synaptic transcriptome in the prefrontal cortex, and are seen as a factor causing the drive to alcohol dependence, and also to other substance abuses.|$|E
5|$|European {{classical}} music changed greatly in the 20th century. New music abandoned {{much of the}} historical, nationally developed schools of harmony and melody in favor of experimental music, atonality, minimalism and electronic music, all of which employ features that have become common to European music in general and not Italy specifically. <b>These</b> <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> also made {{classical music}} less accessible to many people. Important composers of the period include Ottorino Respighi, Ferruccio Busoni, Alfredo Casella, Gian Francesco Malipiero, Franco Alfano, Bruno Maderna, Luciano Berio, Luigi Nono, Sylvano Bussotti, Salvatore Sciarrino, Luigi Dallapiccola, Carlo Jachino, Gian Carlo Menotti, Jacopo Napoli, and Goffredo Petrassi.|$|E

5|$|As the environments of most {{organisms are}} {{constantly}} changing, {{the reactions of}} metabolism must be finely regulated to maintain a constant set of conditions within cells, a condition called homeostasis. Metabolic regulation also allows organisms to respond to signals and interact actively with their environments. Two closely linked concepts are important for understanding how metabolic pathways are controlled. Firstly, the regulation of an enzyme in a pathway is how its activity is increased and decreased in response to signals. Secondly, the control exerted by this enzyme is the effect that these changes in its activity have on the overall rate of the pathway (the flux through the pathway). For example, an enzyme may show large changes in activity (i.e. it is highly regulated) but if <b>these</b> <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> {{little effect on the}} flux of a metabolic pathway, then this enzyme is not involved in the control of the pathway.|$|E

It has also gained tolerance to human presence and handling and living in crowded conditions. It cannot fly, so needs human assistance in finding a mate, and it lacks fear of potential predators. Color pigments are also lost so they are leucistic, because camouflage isn't useful since it can only live in captivity. <b>These</b> <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> made it entirely dependent upon humans for survival.

Using an approach that combines history, ecology, and anthropology, a landscape's history can be observed and deduced through the traces of the various mechanisms that have altered it, anthropogenic or otherwise. Understanding the unique nature of every landscape, in addition to relations among landscapes, and the forms which comprise the landscape, is key to understanding historical ecology.|$|E
25|$|In February 2012, Ontario passed {{legislation}} {{to allow the}} expansion of an already existing drug-tracking system for publicly funded drugs to include those that are privately insured. This database will function to identify and monitor patient’s attempts to seek prescriptions from multiple doctors or retrieve from multiple pharmacies. Other provinces have proposed similar legislation, while some, such as Nova Scotia, have legislation already in effect for monitoring prescription drug use. <b>These</b> <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> coincided with other changes in Ontario’s legislation to target the misuse of painkillers and high addiction rates to drugs such as oxycodone. As of February 29, 2012, Ontario {{passed legislation}} delisting oxycodone from the province’s public drug benefit program. This was a first for any province to delist a drug based on addictive properties. The new law prohibits prescriptions for OxyNeo except to certain patients under the Exceptional Access Program including palliative care and in other extenuating circumstances. Patients already prescribed oxycodone will receive coverage for an additional year for OxyNeo, and after that, it will be disallowed unless designated under the exceptional access program.|$|E

A lot has changed for both the characters, and the show's viewers in the final season. The show lost two cast members: Rebecca Harper (Emily VanCamp) and Robert McCallister (Rob Lowe). These two losses were not the only major changes that occurred in season five. The Ojai Foods building, the Walker's family business, is not seen in the final season and many locations are different than in the last season. Kitty no longer lives at the ranch in Santa Barbara, but has moved into a smaller house with her son, Evan, after a short stay at a cottage in Ojai. Kevin and Scotty moved out of their apartment and into a different one which is located above Cafe 429 (the restaurant that Scotty and Saul opened). Cafe 429, and Nora's new workplace – the radio station, are two primary locations where many scenes take place in season five. One location that the audience does not see as much is Nora's house.
