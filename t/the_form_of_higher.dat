25|$|During {{the period}} of the Napoleonic Wars, {{although}} no formal peace movement was established until the end of hostilities, a significant peace movement animated by universalist ideals did emerge, due to the perception of Britain fighting in a reactionary role and the increasingly visible impact of the war on the welfare of the nation in <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>higher</b> taxation levels and high casualty rates. Sixteen peace petitions to Parliament were signed by members of the public, anti-war and anti-Pitt demonstrations convened and peace literature was widely published and disseminated.|$|E
25|$|Another reason {{minimum wage}} may not affect {{employment}} in certain industries {{is that the}} demand for the product the employees produce is highly inelastic. For example, if management is forced to increase wages, management can pass on the increase in wage to consumers in <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>higher</b> prices. Since demand for the product is highly inelastic, consumers continue to buy the product at the higher price and so the manager is not forced to lay off workers. Economist Paul Krugman argues this explanation neglects {{to explain why the}} firm was not charging this higher price absent the minimum wage.|$|E
25|$|In September 1990 Chrétien {{seeing a}} chance to make a strong {{impression}} on public opinion after a shaky start as a leader reaped a major windfall after Mulroney introduced an unpopular Goods and Services Tax (GST), which Chrétien decided to vigorously oppose. Traditionally in Canada the government had levied a 13.5% Manufacturer's Sales Tax (MST), which was paid by manufacturers, who passed on the cost of the tax to consumers in <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>higher</b> prices. Since foreign manufacturers did not pay the MST, this placed Canadian companies at a competitive disadvantage in their home market, and to compensate the government had levied tariffs on manufactured imports to maintain a level playing field. When the free trade agreement with the United States came into effect in 1989, the government could no longer levy tariffs on American imports, which led to furious complaints from Canadian industry about having to compete with American companies who did not pay the MST. To save Canadian industry and the jobs of those Canadians employed in manufacturing from being destroyed by American competition, the Mulroney government decided in late 1989 to abolish the MST and replace it with the 7% GST, whose costs would be borne by consumers. On the proposed GST, Chrétien was torn between his belief that the GST was economically necessary vs. his desire to score political points by opposing a proposed tax that most Canadians hated, and as such, he was initially vague about where he stood about the GST. It was only in September 1990 after months of vacillation did Chrétien finally make up his mind to oppose the GST.|$|E

500|$|Brown opposes a {{proposed}} multibillion-dollar tax on banks to recoup bailout money and prescribing of bank executive compensation.

He also opposes it on the grounds that the tax would likely be passed onto consumers in <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>higher</b> service and ATM fees. In September 2010, Brown opposed a Senate bill creating a $30 billion government fund aimed at encouraging lending to small businesses. The bill combines the fund with $12 billion in new tax breaks. Brown criticized the bill for including a provision much like the Troubled Asset Relief Program, stating: [...] "Banks making lending decisions with government funds is not the way to get our economy moving again." ...|$|E
500|$|The Fasci {{were the}} result of the revolt of the Sicilian peasants against the {{introduction}} of capitalist relationships into the rural economy aggravated by the world depression in agriculture of the 1880s. [...] The agrarian crisis between 1888 and 1892 led to a steep decrease in wheat prices. The island’s main sources of wealth – wine, fruit and sulphur – suffered a heavy blow. The dominant landowning class channeled most of the economic burden on to the peasantry, in <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>higher</b> rents and discriminatory local taxation. As social tension rose, a handful of young and hitherto quite unknown socialist intellectuals – many of them recent graduates of Palermo University – seized their opportunity. The movement grew under the first government of Prime minister Francesco Crispi (1887-1891) and coincided with unpopular tax increases and ratification of a series of laws curtailing personal freedom. The Italian economy had been sliding into a deep recession since the late 1880s. New protective tariffs had been introduced in 1887 on agricultural and industrial goods, followed by a trade war with France, which badly damaged Italian commerce and affecting Italy’s agricultural exports, the only potentially dynamic economic sector of southern Italy. Many farmers suffered severely.|$|E
2500|$|Depending on how {{quantities}} supplied {{and demanded}} vary with price (the [...] "elasticities" [...] {{of supply and}} demand), a tax can be absorbed by the seller (in the form of lower pre-tax prices), or by the buyer (in <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>higher</b> post-tax prices).

2500|$|Research also {{suggests}} that diversity has a net positive effect on productivity and economic prosperity. A study by Harvard economist Nathan Nunn, Yale economist Nancy Qian and LSE economist Sandra Sequeira found that the Age of Mass Migration (1850–1920) has had substantially beneficial long-term effects on U.S. economic prosperity: [...] "locations with more historical immigration today have higher incomes, less poverty, less unemployment, higher rates of urbanization, and greater educational attainment. The long-run effects appear to arise from the persistence of sizeable short-run benefits, including earlier and more intensive industrialization, increased agricultural productivity, and more innovation." [...] The authors also find that the immigration had short-term benefits: [...] "that {{there is no evidence}} that these long-run benefits come at short-run costs. In fact, immigration immediately led to economic benefits that took <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>higher</b> incomes, higher productivity, more innovation, and more industrialization." ...|$|E
