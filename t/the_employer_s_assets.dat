40|$|The labor {{contract}} usually assigns significant {{authority to}} <b>the</b> <b>employer</b> (hierarchical governance). <b>The</b> threat of hold-up {{of the employee}} by <b>the</b> <b>employer,</b> caused by this asymmetric distribution of decision rights, can be mitigated by a preference for reciprocity {{on the part of}} <b>the</b> <b>employer</b> or by a balance of power arising from the credible threat by the employee to retaliate {{if he or she is}} exploited. The authors of this working paper investigate the interaction between <b>the</b> <b>employer</b> <b>s</b> preferences for reciprocity and the feasibility and willingness to punish hostile behavior by the employee in an overlapping generations model where there is cultural transmission of preferences. The results show that if the net gains from specific investment are high enough, and the quantity of feasible punishment (i. e., the worker s power) is also high, the economy will converge from any initial condition to an efficient cooperative equilibrium. If either of these conditions does not hold, the market will settle down in an inefficient equilibrium where not all types of workers make specific investment or, even if they do, there is surplus destruction, because selfish firms offer low wages. Positive reciprocity on the part of <b>the</b> <b>employer</b> is not enough to achieve an efficient labor culture. There is also a need for a significant allocation of power to the workers, so as to make the threat of punishment a powerful tool to enhance efficiency and cooperation.

This dollar amount is recalculated each year as health care costs and plans' premiums increase. Certain employees (such as postal workers) have a higher portion of their premiums paid {{as the result of}} collective bargaining agreements. The precise percentage of the average paid by <b>the</b> <b>employer</b> is relatively unimportant to the design of this program and has changed over time to become more generous. What is important {{is that it is a}} [...] "capped premium" [...] design, in which the entire marginal cost of joining a plan with a premium near, at, or above the all-plan average is borne by the enrollee. In other words, enrollees pay the entire cost of their costly choices, but reap rewards if they make frugal choices. This creates constant pressure on the plans, since to attract enrollees they must hold down costs, while balancing this incentive against benefit offerings and customer service, to reach a position that will maximize their enrollment revenues and profits. This feature of the program is arguably its greatest strength and the primary reason that one expert summarized it has having [...] "outperformed Medicare every which way—in containment of costs both to consumers and to the government, in benefit and product innovation and modernization, and in consumer satisfaction," [...] decade after decade.|$|R

The MEPS-IC is a nationally representative, annual establishment survey from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Pooling the establishment level data from the MEPS-IC from 1996 - 2004 and matching with the Longitudinal Business Database and supplemental economic data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a reduced form model of the percent of total FTE employees working part-time is estimated. This is modeled {{as a function of}} <b>the</b> <b>employer</b> health insurance contribution, establishment characteristics, and state-level economic indicators. To account for potential endogeneity, health insurance expenditures are estimated using instrumental variables (IVs). The unit of analysis is establishments that offer health insurance to full-time employees but not part time employees. Conditional on establishments offering health insurance to full-time employees, a 1 percent increase in employer health insurance contributions results in a 3. 7 percent increase in part-time employees working at establishments in <b>the</b> U. <b>S.</b> <b>employer</b> health insurance costs; labor demand; part-time employment...|$|R

The problem is that, while most theoretical explanation s for the size-wage premium are based on <b>the</b> matching of <b>employers</b> and employees, previous empirical work has relied on either worker surveys with little information about <b>the</b> <b>employer,</b> or establishmen t surveys with little information about the workers.

40|$|The debt {{collection}} process in Anglo-American law {{is based on}} the creditor 2 ̆ 7 s right to receive payment from liquidation of the debtor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>assets.</b> Judicial procedures are available to the unsecured creditor for the purpose of converting the debtor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>assets</b> to cash.

It is an economic necessity for creditors to have an efficient collection mechanism which gives them maximum protection in the event of default by the debtor. Nonetheless, all states shield the debtor from complete destitution by keeping certain property, for example, life insurance proceeds, beyond the reach of creditors. By permitting the debtor to keep those assets necessary for his economic survival, state exemption laws fulfill important social policies which must be balanced against the need for creditor protection. When a debtor files a petition in bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee takes title to most of the debtor 2 ̆ 7 s property, thereby enabling the trustee to liquidate the debtor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>assets</b> for the benefit of creditors.

Traditionally apprenticeship had been the main formal method of training for manual workers and the principal means whereby intermediate skills were formed.

During <b>the</b> 1980 <b>s</b> <b>employers</b> did little to sustain apprenticeships, and the Conservative government was suspicious of a form of training which it associated with trade unions.

In {{a significant change in}} policy in autumn 1993 the then Conservative government announced the Modern Apprenticeship.
