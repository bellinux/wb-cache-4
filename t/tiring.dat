Roberts got $2 million and the other 500 MITS shareholders (including the Altair co-designer, William Yates) split the rest.|$|E
50|$|Airless <b>tires</b> are {{attractive}} to cyclists, as bicycle <b>tires</b> {{are much more}} vulnerable to punctures than motor vehicle <b>tires.</b> The drawbacks to airless <b>tires</b> depend on the use. Heavy equipment operators who use machinery with solid <b>tires</b> will complain of fatigue whereas lawn mowers that use solid or airless <b>tires</b> have no drawbacks. Bicycle riders who use airless <b>tires</b> may complain that the <b>tire</b> is harder than a comparable pneumatic <b>tire.</b> Only anecdotal evidence exists that airless <b>tires</b> may cause broken spokes on a bicycle wheel. Any airless <b>tire</b> will be heavier than the rubber <b>tire</b> {{it is meant to}} replace; however, many rubber pneumatic <b>tires</b> are also heavy. Rubber <b>tires</b> vary in rolling resistance and an airless <b>tire</b> or solid insert may only marginally increase rolling resistance if at all.|$|R

5|$|In {{only his}} second {{fight for the}} UFC, Jon Jones took on The Ultimate Fighter 1 runner-up Stephan Bonnar at light heavyweight in the third fight on the main card. Jones was able to execute {{multiple}} throws and takedowns {{during the first two}} rounds, at one point suplexing Bonnar. Jones also had the most success striking and was able to knock down his opponent with a spinning elbow-strike. Bonnar rallied with strikes against the <b>tiring</b> Jones in the third round, but the bout went the distance with the judges scoring it 29–28 once and 30–27 twice all in favor of Jones.|$|E
5|$|Initially Gazan made rapid progress, but {{he quickly}} {{recognized}} that the opposing force was much stronger than the typical rearguard of a retreating army. Realizing he had been duped and that Gazan's troops were <b>tiring</b> rapidly, Mortier sent orders to Dupont's division to hurry forward. By mid-morning the French momentum had stalled; Mortier committed most of his remaining forces to driving Miloradovich back, leaving a single battalion—perhaps 300troops—to cover his northern flank, and sent the rest to attack the Russian right. Within 30minutes he achieved the superiority of numbers he sought. His 4,500French opposed 2,600Russians and forced them back toward Stein while pressing an attack along the river. Miloradovich had no option, for neither Strik's nor Dokhtorov's flanking columns were to be seen.|$|E
5|$|Minton was {{a fierce}} {{partisan}} {{during his time}} in the Senate, and regularly abused his opponents verbally. Democratic Senator Huey Long became one of Minton's favorite targets because of Long's often-threatened filibusters. During one of the filibusters, Long threatened to join the Republican Party. After most senators had left the chamber, Minton remained for several hours to periodically taunt Long. After <b>tiring</b> of the taunts, Long launched a rebuttal from the podium, calling Minton a vicious politician whose positions would cost Minton re-election. The exchange was unusual for its tone and later made national news.|$|E

5|$|In the 1992–93 season, {{despite a}} 32.6 ppg, 6.7 rpg, and 5.5 apg campaign, Jordan's streak of {{consecutive}} MVP seasons ended as {{he lost the}} award to his friend Charles Barkley. Coincidentally, Jordan and the Bulls met Barkley and his Phoenix Suns in the 1993 NBA Finals. The Bulls won their third NBA championship on a game-winning shot by John Paxson and a last-second block by Horace Grant, but Jordan was once again Chicago's leader. He averaged a Finals-record 41.0 ppg during the six-game series, {{and became the first}} player in NBA history to win three straight Finals MVP awards. He scored more than 30 points in every game of the series, including 40 or more points in 4 consecutive games. With his third Finals triumph, Jordan capped off a seven-year run where he attained seven scoring titles and three championships, but there were signs that Jordan was <b>tiring</b> of his massive celebrity and all of the non-basketball hassles in his life.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{staged a}} <b>tiring,</b> dangerous, and {{high-profile}} trip to South Africa in January 1985. He defied both the apartheid government's wishes and militant leftist AZAPO demonstrators by spending {{a night in}} the Soweto home of Bishop Desmond Tutu and also visited Winnie Mandela, wife of imprisoned black leader Nelson Mandela. Upon returning, Kennedy became {{a leader in the}} push for economic sanctions against South Africa; collaborating with Senator Lowell Weicker, he secured Senate passage, and the overriding of Reagan's veto, of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986. Despite their many political differences, Kennedy and Reagan had a good personal relationship, and with the administration's approval Kennedy traveled to the Soviet Union in 1986 to act as a go-between in arms control negotiations with reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. The discussions were productive, and Kennedy also helped gain the release of a number of Soviet Jewish refuseniks, including Anatoly Shcharansky.|$|E

5|$|On a small {{ground at}} Belmont, the September grass was coarse. It had been rolled {{so that the}} ball moved very quickly across the ground. The Australian side, fielding first, dropped many catches and could not cope with the short boundary, {{allowing}} the Philadelphians to reach a huge total of 525 runs. King came in to bat last, at number 11, making 36 runs. The leading Australian bowlers, Hugh Trumble and George Giffen, took 2 for 104 and 0 for 114 respectively. When the Australians came to bat, they hoped that they would, by now, have recovered from their <b>tiring</b> journey, but ran into problems when dealing with Bart King's developing swing bowling. The side was all out for 199, with King taking 5 wickets for 78 runs. The Australians followed on and were all out again for 268, allowing the Gentlemen of Philadelphia to win by an innings and 68 runs.|$|E
5|$|Pre-planning for a year, {{including}} {{ten months}} for production issues {{and two months}} for his character, was <b>tiring</b> for Aamir. As a first-time producer, he obtained a crew of about 300 people for six months. Due {{to the lack of}} comfortable hotels in Bhuj, he hired a newly constructed apartment and furnished it completely for the crew. Security was set up and a special housekeeping team was brought {{to take care of the}} crew's needs. Most of the 19th century tools and equipment depicted in the film were lent to the crew by the local villagers. Initially, they did not want to part with their equipment, but after much coaxing, they gave in. They then travelled to different parts of the country to collect the musical instruments used in that day and era.|$|E
5|$|Doctor Neo Cortex is a mad {{scientist}} who captures Coco and Aku Aku {{and wants to}} use stolen Mojo to create an army of mutants. Uka Uka, who is also absent in the Nintendo DS version, is behind Cortex's plot for world domination; after <b>tiring</b> of Cortex's incompetence, Uka replaces him with his cyborg niece, Nina Cortex. Aiding the Cortexes are Doctor N. Gin, who is Cortex's hysterical right-hand man, and Tiny Tiger. Dingodile, another minion of Cortex, exclusively appears in the DS and Game Boy Advance versions of Crash of the Titans as a boss character. Aiding the villains {{are a number of}} small fodder enemies that attempt to hinder Crash in his journey. Each fodder is affiliated with a certain villain in the game. The first fodders encountered are Neo Cortex's Ratnicians, which appear as bipedal, chihuahua-like animals dressed as laboratory researchers. These characters appear in the first four episodes of the game, and are replaced by other enemies as the game progresses. The later enemies include Tiny Tiger's Southern-accented Koo-alas, Doctor N. Gin's monkey wrench-wielding Doom Monkeys, Uka Uka's spear-chucking Voodoo Bunnies, and Nina Cortex's Brat Girls. Radical Entertainment sought to give these minor characters personalities by giving them a large number of distinctive quotations.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tires</b> {{are often}} {{improved}} on off-road vehicles {{in order to}} better traverse rough terrain. Regular automotive <b>tires</b> don't provide enough traction to help a vehicle through sand, dirt, snow and ice, so specialized <b>tires</b> are normally used on off-road 4x4 vehicles. Large overall wheel diameter provides a better ride comfort and road clearance. Wide <b>tires</b> help to distribute the weight on sand, while narrower <b>tires</b> help get better traction in the snow or on ice. Each <b>tire</b> type has its own tread type to provide a proper grip in certain road conditions. Common off-road <b>tire</b> types are: Sand <b>tires,</b> Mud-terrain <b>tire,</b> Snow <b>tires</b> and All-terrain <b>tire.</b>|$|R

5|$|Metternich {{continued}} {{negotiations with}} the French envoy Caulaincourt through early to mid March 1814, when victory at the Laon put the Coalition back on the offensive. By this time Metternich was <b>tiring</b> of trying to hold the Coalition together, and even the British-engineered Treaty of Chaumont did not help. In {{the absence of the}} Prussians and Russians the Coalition agreed to the restoration of the Bourbon dynasty. Francis rejected a final plea from Napoleon that he abdicate in favour of his wife, and Paris fell on 30 March. Military manoeuvres had forced Metternich westward to Dijon on 24 March and now, after deliberate delay, he left for the French capital on 7 April. On 10 April he found a city at peace and, much to his annoyance, largely in the control of Tsar Alexander. The Austrians disliked the terms of the Treaty of Fontainebleau that Russia had imposed on Napoleon in their absence, but Metternich was reluctant to oppose them and on 11 April signed the treaty. Thereafter he focused on safeguarding Austrian interests in the forthcoming peace; asserting Austria's influence in Germany over that of Prussia; and undoing Russian ascendancy. For these reasons he ensured that the Italian provinces of Lombardy and Venetia, lost to French client states in 1805, were duly re-annexed.|$|E
5|$|The Aniplex {{producer}} of Angel Beats!, Hironori Toba, was interviewed in the November 2009 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, where he commented that a 13-episode anime with about 21 minutes per episode {{was not enough}} to tell the whole story of Angel Beats! Maeda had envisioned. Therefore, the various additional media, such as the illustrated short stories and manga, contain some of the story that was unable to make it into the anime because of time constraints. Toba wanted fans of the series to be able to enjoy it to the fullest by exploring all of the media types. Maeda found it <b>tiring</b> to go back and forth between Osaka and Tokyo for business meetings {{when he was in the}} process of writing the script, and found it difficult to write an entire script by himself, since he had never done that before with any of the games he produced as a member of Key. It was only after the script was done that Maeda was able to work on the music, which he greatly enjoyed and never tired of it. Maeda composed about 15 songs for Girls Dead Monster and spent about two days each composing each song. He made sure to create songs for Girls Dead Monster that high school girls would compose, including the lyrics. Due to this, Maeda pointed out that the opening and ending theme songs for Angel Beats!, which Maeda also composed, sound like they were composed by a different person compared to the Girls Dead Monster songs.|$|E
5|$|The fourth Test, {{in front}} of Hutton's home crowd, was his least {{successful}} of the series. He was bowled second ball by a yorker from Lindwall and England struggled to remain competitive throughout the match. In the fourth innings of the game, Australia needed 177 runs to win, with 115 minutes of play remaining. Hutton used Trevor Bailey to bowl negatively and slow Australia down; his tactics, including time-wasting {{and the use of}} leg theory, meant Australia could not score the runs in the available time and the match was drawn. It is possible that the idea came from Bailey himself, but the Australian press criticised Hutton for his negativity. In contrast, English critics believed the tactics were justified. Amid great public interest for the deciding fifth Test, Hutton lost his fifth successive toss but replying to Australia's first innings of 275, England established a narrow first-innings lead. Surviving an early scare when a bouncer from Lindwall nearly knocked his cap onto his wickets, Hutton scored 82. In reply, Australia collapsed before the England spinners and England scored the necessary 132 runs to win their first series against Australia since 1932–33 and their first such home series win since 1926. Wisden praised Hutton's strategy and tactical sense, and he was widely acclaimed in the press, particularly for the good spirit which he and Hassett, the Australian captain, maintained. Hutton scored 443 runs at an average of 55.37 in the Tests, but found it mentally <b>tiring</b> to lead England. Meanwhile, some Yorkshire observers felt he should do more to improve discipline at the county. In the whole summer, he scored 2,458 runs at an average of 63.02.|$|E
