The donor methoxyphenyl group deviates from planarity with the thiazole azo moiety by ca. 38 ◦; while the acceptor dicyanovinyl, indandione and dicyanovinylindanone groups diverge by ca. 6 ◦. The HOMOs {{for the three}} dyes are identical. They spread over the methoxyphenyl donor moiety, the thiazole and benzene rings as π-bonding orbitals. The LUMOs are shaped up {{by the nature of}} the acceptor moieties. The LUMOs of the A, B and C dyes extend over the indandione, malononitrile and dicyanovinylindanone acceptor moieties, respectively, as π-antibonding orbitals. The HOMO-LUMO splittings showed that Dye C is much more reactive than dyes A and B. Compared to dyes A and B, Dye C yielded a longer maximum absorption wavelength because of the stabilization of its LUMOs relative to those of the other two. The three dyes show solvatochromism accompanied by signiﬁcant increases in hyperpolarizability. The enhancement of the total hyperpolarizability of C compared to those of A and B is due to the cumulative action of the long π-conjugation of the indanone ring and the stronger electron-withdrawing ability of the dicyanovinyl moiety that form the dicyanovinylindanone acceptor group.

TiTHE PHYSIOLOGIC and pathologic consequences of magnesium deficit or excess iii animals, and the important role of magnesium as a co-factor in many enzyme systems have been well recognized. However, knowledge concerning the role of magnesium in human disease has lagged behind that of sodium and potassium. This has been, in part, {{due to the fact that}} methods for the determination of magnesium in biologic material have been time-consuming and less accurate than the rapid flame-photometry method available for the determination of sodium and potassium.

The stability of this complex is indistinguishable {{from that of the}} corresponding complex of TOTO with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). To examine if TOTO exhibits any binding preference for dsDNA or ssDNA, transfer of TOTO from pre-labeled complexes to excess unlabeled DNA was assayed by gel electrophoresis. Transfer of TOTO from M 13 ssDNA to unlabeled dsDNA proceeds to the same extent as that from M 13 dsDNA to unlabeled dsDNA. A substantial amount of the dye is retained by both the M 13 ssDNA and M 13 dsDNA even when the competing dsDNA is present at a 600 -fold weight excess; for both dsDNA and ssDNA, the pre-labeled complex retains approximately one TOTO per 30 bp (dsDNA) or bases (ssDNA). Rapid transfer of dye from both dsDNA and ssDNA complexes is seen at Na+ concentrations > 50 mM. Interestingly, at higher Na+ or Mg 2 + concentrations, the M 13 ssDNA-TOTO complex appears to be more stable to intrinsic dissociation (dissociation in the absence of competing DNA) than the complex between TOTO and M 13 dsDNA. Similar results were obtained with the structurally unrelated dye ethidium homodimer. The dsDNA- and ssDNA-TOTO complexes were further examined by absorption, fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The surprising conclusion is that polycationic dyes, such as TOTO and EthD, capable of bis-intercalation, interact with dsDNA and ssDNA with very similar high affinity...|$|R

40|$|The cyanine <b>dye</b> <b>thiazole</b> orange (TO) is a {{well-known}} fluorogenic stain for DNA and RNA, but this property precludes its use as an intracellular fluorescent probe for non-nucleic acid biomolecules. Further, {{as is the case}} with many cyanines, the dye suffers from low photostability. Here, we report the synthesis of a bridge-substituted version of TO named α-CN-TO, where the central methine hydrogen of TO is replaced by an electron withdrawing cyano group, which was expected to decrease the susceptibility of the dye toward singlet oxygen-mediated degradation. An X-ray crystal structure shows that α-CN-TO is twisted drastically out of plane, in contrast to TO, which crystallizes in the planar conformation. α-CN-TO retains the fluorogenic behavior of the parent dye TO in viscous glycerol/water solvent, but direct irradiation and indirect bleaching studies showed that α-CN-TO is essentially inert to visible light and singlet oxygen. In addition, the twisted conformation of α-CN-TO mitigates nonspecific binding and fluorescence activation by DNA and a previously selected TO-binding protein and exhibits low background fluorescence in HeLa cell culture. α-CN-TO was then used to select a new protein that binds and activates fluorescence from the dye. The new α-CN-TO/protein fluoromodule exhibits superior photostability to an analogous TO/protein fluoromodule. These properties indicate that α-CN-TO will be a useful fluorogenic dye in combination with specific RNA and protein binding partners for both in vitro and cell-based applications.

Langmuir, 32 (45), 11986 – 11992. [URL] gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been extensively used in sensing, drug delivery, and materials science. A key step is to attach DNA to AuNPs, forming a stable and functional conjugate. Although the traditional salt-aging method takes a full day or longer, a recent low-pH method allows DNA conjugation in a few minutes. The effect of low pH was attributed to the protonation of adenine (A) and cytosine (C), resulting in an overall lower negative charge density on DNA. In this work, the effect of DNA conformation at low pH is studied. Using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, the parallel poly-A duplex (A-motif) is detected when a poly-A segment is linked to a random DNA, a design typically used for DNA conjugation. A DNA staining <b>dye,</b> <b>thiazole</b> orange, is identified for detecting such A-motifs. The A-motif structure is ideal for DNA conjugation because it exposes the thiol group to directly react with the gold surface while minimizing nonspecific DNA base adsorption. For nonthiolated DNA, the optimal procedure is to incubate DNA and AuNPs followed by lowering the pH. The i-motif formed by poly-C DNA at low pH is less favorable to the conjugation reaction because of its unique way of folding. The stability of poly-A and poly-G DNA at low pH is examined.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: A {{simple and}} rapid method for {{measuring}} the hybridization stability of duplexes of DNAs and other oligomers in different environments is described. When added to an oligomer duplex, the <b>thiazole</b> orange (TO) <b>dye</b> intercalates and in this state is fluorescent. Therefore, when duplex dissociation occurs, the release of TO results in a detectable change in fluorescence intensity. This assay was developed primarily to screen antisense oligomer duplexes that are stable in serum and in the cytoplasm but unstable {{in the presence of}} their target messenger RNA (mRNA). METHODS: The two antisense oligomers of this investigation were both 25 mer phosphorothioate (PS) DNAs, one directed against the RIα mRNA and the other directed against the mdr 1 mRNA. The former duplex was first used in the solution studies, in most cases duplexed with a 16 mer phosphodiester (PO) complementary DNA (i. e., PS-DNA 25 /PO-cDNA 16). Both duplexes were then tested in a series of cell studies using SK-BR- 3 (RIα+), KB-G 2 (mdr 1 ++), and KB- 31 (mdr 1 +/-) cells. RESULTS: Preliminary measurements in solution showed that maximum fluorescence was achieved when more than ten TO molecules were bound to each duplex. When a 25 mer PO-DNA or PO-RNA with the base sequence of the RIα mRNA was added, the dramatic change in fluorescence intensity that followed signified dissociation of the antisense DNA from the study duplex and reassociation with the target DNA. Kinetic measurements showed that this process was completed in about 3 min. Fluorescent measurements of SK-BR- 3 (RIα+) cells incubated at 37 degrees C with the anti-RIα study duplex over time showed a maximum {{at the point where the}} loss of fluorescence due to dissociation of the study duplex, probably by an antisense mechanism, began to dominate over the increasing fluorescence due to continuing cellular accumulation. A similar result was observed in the KB-G 2 (mdr 1 +) cells incubated with the anti-mdr 1 study duplex. CONCLUSIONS: When study duplexes shown to be stable in serum were incubated with their target cells, the assay successfully detected evidence of dissociation, most likely by an antisense mechanism. Thus, a TO fluorescence assay has been developed that is capable of detecting the dissociation of DNA duplexes...|$|R
40|$|DNA-functionalized gold {{nanoparticles}} (AuNPs) {{have been}} extensively used in sensing, drug delivery, and materials science. A key {{step is to}} attach DNA onto AuNPs forming a stable and functional conjugate. While the traditional salt-aging method takes a full day or longer, a recent low-pH method allows DNA conjugation to happen in a few minutes. The effect of low pH was previously attributed to protonation of adenine (A) and cytosine (C), resulting in an overall lower negative charge density on DNA which is helpful for conjugating onto citrate-capped AuNPs. However, this simple charge argument does not answer why poly-A DNA works better than poly-C DNA. In addition to protonation, at low pH, DNA rich in adenine and cytosine could form higher secondary structures (e. g. the A-motif for poly-A DNA and i-motif for poly-C DNA). We suspect that such DNA folding might {{also play a role}} in DNA conjugation to AuNPs. In this thesis, the effect of DNA conformation at low pH is studied. Using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, parallel poly-A duplex (A-motif) is detected when a poly-A segment is linked to a random DNA, a design typically used for DNA conjugation. A DNA staining <b>dye,</b> <b>thiazole</b> orange, is identified for detecting such A-motifs. We found that the A-motif structure is ideal for DNA conjugation since it exposes the terminal thiol group adjacent to the poly-A for directly reacting with the gold surface while minimizing non-specific DNA base adsorption. Keeping this in mind, the order of reagent addition was further studied. However, for non-thiolated DNA, if the A-motif structure can be formed before the DNA is mixed with AuNPs, alternatively, the sample can be acidified after mixing AuNPs and DNA to then promote A-motif formation. Our results showed that the latter method is better. By taking DNA conformation into consideration, we can also explain the less optimal performance of the C-rich DNA. The i-motif formed by poly-C DNA at low pH is less favorable for the conjugation reaction due to its unique way of folding. Finally, the stability of poly-A and poly-G DNA in low pH also is examined due to the concerns related to DNA depurination and subsequent cleavage. An excellent stability of poly-A DNA is confirmed, while poly-G has slightly lower stability. Overall, the stability is sufficient for the low pH method for DNA attachment.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{understanding}} {{the interactions of}} cyanine dyes with DNA, {{through the use of}} both experimental and computational techniques. Although cyanine dyes are widely used as nucleic acids stains in fluorescence applications, the nature of the association process is not always clear. The cyanine dye PicoGreenRTM (PG) has proven to be extremely useful in monitoring DNA damage but its structure is proprietary, making it impossible to understand its specific interactions with DNA. However, its structure is known to resemble that of another cyanine <b>dye,</b> <b>thiazole</b> orange (TO). We anticipated that the N-propyl pyridinium derivative of TO (PTO) would also intercalate in DNA and that its extra positive charge, relative to TO, would aid in the association. Our studies have focused on the associations of PG, TO and PTO with DNA. Chapter 3 deals with the association of the dyes with single-stranded DNA homopolymers. The combination of spectroscopic techniques and molecular dynamics (MD) calculations provides a unique understanding of the associations of TO and PTO with single-stranded DNA homopolymers. There is highly specific binding of TO and PTO to poly(dG) and poly(dA), while poly(dC) and poly(dT) bind the dyes very weakly and appear to promote dye aggregation. Due to its proprietary structure, PG could not be studied computationally. However, the experimental spectral results suggest that PG associates differently with single-stranded DNA than do TO and PTO. There are two major findings in Chapter 4. Firstly, the dyes associate strongly with double-stranded DNA, as demonstrated by the experimental spectral results and the MD calculations. Experimental evidence supports not only monomeric dye intercalation in DNA, but also dimeric dye intercalation. The results of the MD simulations suggest that TO and PTO bind to DNA without sequence specificity. The second major finding was that a new type of stable dye/DNA complex is formed when single strands of poly(dA) and poly(dT) are hybridized in the presence of PG or PTO, which cannot be obtained by addition of the dye to poly(dA) ·poly(dT). For all three dyes, complete DNA renaturation did not occur during thermal cycling of dye/double-stranded calf thymus DNA. These results suggest that intercalating cyanine dyes can interfere with DNA hybridization to double-stranded DNA. Chapter 5 is concerned with a more practical aspect of the association of cyanine dyes with DNA: using thiazole orange to report UVC-induced DNA damage. A variety of spectroscopic techniques, as well as agarose gel electrophoresis, were examined for their ability to detect UVC-induced DNA damage. The most sensitive methodology of all of those tested was fluorescence spectroscopy using TO. All of the spectroscopic techniques involving TO suggest that TO intercalation is susceptible to UVC-induced DNA damage. The computational studies suggest that the presence of cyclobutadipyrimidines, and not 8 -oxo- 2 '-deoxyguanosine, is a factor in the experimentally observed reduction in dye intercalation. These studies have been a proof-of-concept, to demonstrate the usefulness of this fluorescence technique in detecting high levels of DNA damage, comparable to those used in food irradiation...|$|R
