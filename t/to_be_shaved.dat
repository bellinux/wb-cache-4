Continuing to espouse his straight-edge philosophy, Punk began to present himself as a cult-like savior to the crowd, growing the hair on his head, face and chest in an allusion to Jesus. Through January 2010, Punk began to convert planted {{members of the audience}} to a straight-edge lifestyle, making them take a pledge of allegiance to him and shaving their head as a sign of renewal and devotion. After converting many people who were not seen again, convert Serena began accompanying Punk and Gallows to form the Straight Edge Society. As well as leading this alliance, Punk was also the mentor of WWE NXT rookie Darren Young who flirted with the idea of becoming straight-edge before refusing just before his head was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shaved.</b>|$|E

He capped 2007 by defeating Tigre Universitario to win the WWA World Middleweight Championship Defeating Tigre Universitario for the championship was part of a long running storyline between the two, a storyline that would see both of them involved in a four-man Lucha de Apuesta on March 23, 2008.

25|$|The fifth {{match of}} Triplemanía XX {{was also a}} Hair vs. Hair match, contested for the hairs of Joaquín and Dorian Roldán. Joaquin led his team of Electroshock and L.A. Park into the arena, {{followed}} by Dorian {{and his team of}} Jeff Jarrett and Kurt Angle. The rudo team was also accompanied by Karen Jarrett, Jeff's wife and the former wife of Angle. Towards the end of the match, as referee Piero was busy keeping Karen out of the ring, Dorian entered and attacked Electroshock, which led to also his father entering the ring and telling him to get out. Dorian looked like he was about to leave the ringside area, only to return with La Sociedad member and half of the AAA World Tag Team Champions, Abyss, by his side. After a hot tag, L.A. Park was in control of his opponents, which led to Abyss entering the ring, only for Park to dropkick him out and hit him with a suicide dive. At this point, Dorian again entered the ring, but was followed by Joaquín, who dropped his son with a clothesline. As Jarrett went for diving crossbody, Park moved, which resulted in him taking out referee Piero instead. Park rolled Jarrett in an inside cradle, but Piero was unable to make the count. Abyss then once again entered the ring and hit Park with a chokeslam. He went to perform the same move on Electroshock, but got hit with a cutter instead. Electroshock then countered Angle's finishing maneuver, the Angle Slam, into an arm drag, before hitting him also with the cutter. Electroshock pinned Angle, as Park jumped on top of him, and scored the three count for the win, forcing Dorian Roldán to have his head shaved bald. However, before the shaving took place, Joaquín asked his son to disband La Sociedad and return to AAA, which led to Dorian apologizing for his actions and agreeing to disband the rudo stable. Jarrett tried to protest, but was shut down by Electroshock. Joaquín then announced {{that he did not want}} his son <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shaved,</b> drawing the ire of L.A. Park. Suddenly, Dorian attacked his father, while Jarrett and Angle did the same to Electroshock and Park. Dorian then shaved his father's head, before leading La Sociedad out of the ring. Park, infuriated by what had happened, went to AAA president Marisela Peña Roldán, the wife of Joaquín and the mother of Dorian, and told her that she should have never let Joaquín get his hands on Antonio Peña's company.|$|E

On October 7, 2005 Texano Jr. won his first professional wrestling championship when he teamed up with El Sagrado and Máximo to defeat Pandilla Guerrera ("Gang of Warriors"; Sangre Azteca, Doctor X and Nitro) to win the Mexican National Trios Championship. Over the next 569 days Texano Jr., Sagrado and Máximo defended the trios championship against teams such as Danger, Infierno, Magnum; deposed champions Doctor X, Nitro, Sangre Azteca and the team of Arkangel, Doctor X and Misterioso II. On April 29, 2007 the team lost the Mexican National Trios Title to the Los Perros del Mal ("The Bad Dogs") faction of Mr. Águila, Damián 666 and Halloween. The title change came about as El Texano Jr. turned on his partners mid-match, giving Los Perros del Mal an easy victory. Not long after turning Rudo (the Lucha Libre term for heel, or villain) Texano Jr. joined Los Perros del Mal and began teaming with El Terrible on a regular basis. On June 13, 2008 Texano Jr. participated in the main event of CMLL's annual Infierno en el Ring show, a multi-man steel cage match where the last man in the ring would have his hair shaved off. The match involved Los Perros del Mal, represented by Texano Jr. Damián 666, Mr. Águila, El Terrible and Perro Aguayo Jr. while the tecnico (Face or good guys in wrestling) side was represented by Alex Koslov, Marco Corleone, Shocker, Negro Casas and Heavy Metal.

In lucha libre the Lucha de Apuesta victory is considered the highest [...] "prize" [...] that a wrestler can win, more so than championships. Two months later he won the hair of Álvaro Velazco in a match in Mexico City. Those two Apuesta matches {{were part of a}} buildup towards one of the feature matches of the 1st EMLL 30th Anniversary Show, held on September 6, 1963. At the show Rubén Juárez defeated Espanto II in a Lucha de Apuesta, forcing Espanto to unmask. After unmasking he gave his birth name as [...] "Fernando Vázquez Cisneros", using a combination of his and his partners' paternal last names to maintain the story that the Espantos were brothers. A few weeks later Espanto I gained a measure of revenge for his team as he defeated Rubén Juárez as part of the 2nd EMLL 30th Anniversary Show. In November 1962 Espanto I and II were joined by Espanto III, Euseibo's younger brother Miguel, forming a regular trio. At the same time Espanto I and II also regularly teamed up with El Santo, often headlining EMLL shows across Mexico. Teaming with El Santo was part of a storyline where Espanto I and II would attack El Santo after a match, turning Santo to the tecnico side (those that portray the [...] "good guys") in the process. On Jun 22, 1963, Espanto I, II and El Santo lost a match to Rito Romero, Rayo de Jalisco, and Henry Pilusso. Being disappointed with the loss Espanto II attacked El Santo, but ended up with his own mask torn up and his face covered in blood when El Santo fought back. In the buildup to the mask vs. mask match between Espanto I and El Santo, El Santo defeated Espanto II in a Lucha de Apuesta match in late 1963, forcing Espanto II to have all his hair shaved off. A couple of months later El Santo would unmask Espanto I, who also stated that his last name was [...] "Vázquez Cisneros".|$|E

The push continued {{when he won the}} NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship, defeating Black Warrior for the championship in 1997. In 1998, he began teaming regularly with Mr. Niebla, and together they won the CMLL World Tag Team Championship. The two later had the championship taken away from them when Mr. Niebla suffered a severe injury. In 1999, Shocker's career was further elevated when he turned heel and began storyline feud with Mr. Niebla. The feud culminated in a match at the CMLL 66th Anniversary Show where Shocker and Mr. Niebla were paired up for a Parejas Suicidas ("Suicide Pairs") match against another pair of feuding partners, Atlantis and Villano III. The rules were that the losing team had to face each other immediately after losing the match in a mask vs. mask match. Shocker and Niebla lost the match and Shocker lost the subsequent Lucha de Apuesta match, losing his mask as a result. After losing his mask, Shocker was pushed even more, capitalizing on his good looks. He took the nickname [...] "1000% Guapo", or [...] "1000% Handsome". He joined up Bestia Salvaje and Scorpio Jr. to form Los Guapos ("The Hansome Ones") in 2000. Shocker later had a falling out with his tag team partners, and he had a heel vs. heel feud along with partners like Los Capos (Cien Caras, Universo 2000 and Máscara Año 2000) and El Satánico. In 2003, he started a new version of Los Guapos with frequent tag team partner Máscara Mágica and El Terrible and feuded with the original Guapos members Bestia Salvaje, Scorpio Jr. and Emilio Charles Jr. who were now wrestling as Los Talibanes ("the Taliban"). The feud peaked with a six-man cage match where El Terrible defeated Bestia Salvaje, forcing him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shaved</b> bald as a result. By 2004, Shocker was a full-time babyface teaming with L.A. Park and trading the CMLL World Tag Team Championship with Último Guerrero and Rey Bucanero.

Terrible's replacement, Alan Stone hardly teamed with Shocker and Máscara Mágica afterwards and Los Guapos was effectively ended by the end of 2004. For most of the summer, he joined up with Perro Aguayo Jr. and Negro Casas in a feud against Pierroth Jr., Vampiro Canadiense and Tarzan Boy.
