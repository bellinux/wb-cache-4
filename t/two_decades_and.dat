5|$|Gandhi's {{first major}} {{achievement}} came in 1917 with the Champaran agitation in Bihar. The Champaran agitation pitted the local peasantry against their largely British landlords who were {{backed by the}} local administration. The peasantry was forced to grow Indigo, a cash crop whose demand had been declining over <b>two</b> <b>decades,</b> <b>and</b> were forced to sell their crops to the planters at a fixed price. Unhappy with this, the peasantry appealed to Gandhi at his ashram in Ahmedabad. Pursuing a strategy of nonviolent protest, Gandhi took the administration by surprise and won concessions from the authorities.|$|E

5|$|On 3 September 2004, Hyundai Rotem, Mitsui, RM Transit Technology and dU LexBuild {{received}} {{an order to}} refurbish all 396 carriages, costing S$142.7 million in total. The works included the refurbishment of interior fixtures, the addition of wheelchair spaces, the upgrading of onboard communications equipment, enhancement of the public announcement system, and general improvement of the cars' appearance. SMRT Corporation said the reasons for refurbishment were wear and damage of important components over the past <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> <b>and</b> water leaks from the air-conditioning system on some trains. The company chose this option instead of buying new rolling stock, which would have cost S$792 million.

5|$|Wilberforce and Clarkson had {{collected}} a {{large volume of}} evidence against the slave trade over the previous <b>two</b> <b>decades,</b> <b>and</b> Wilberforce spent {{the latter part of}} 1806 writing A Letter on the Abolition of the Slave Trade, which was a comprehensive restatement of the abolitionists' case. The death of Fox in September 1806 was a blow, but was followed quickly by a general election in the autumn of 1806. Slavery became an election issue, bringing more abolitionist MPs into the House of Commons, including former military men who had personally experienced the horrors of slavery and slave revolts. Wilberforce was re-elected as an MP for Yorkshire, after which he returned to finishing and publishing his Letter, in reality a 400-page book which formed the basis for the final phase of the campaign.|$|E
5|$|According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian {{economy in}} 2017 was {{nominally}} worth US$2.454 trillion; {{it is the}} sixth-largest economy by market exchange rates, and is, at US$9.489 trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity, or PPP. With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over the past <b>two</b> <b>decades,</b> <b>and</b> reaching 6.1% during 2011–12, India {{is one of the}} world's fastest-growing economies. However, the country ranks 140th in the world in nominal GDP per capita and 129th in GDP per capita at PPP. Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics. Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy; since then it has slowly moved towards a free-market system by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows.

5|$|Chelsea {{created their}} first chance {{of the match}} after 18 minutes – a shot from Lampard which hit Kolo Touré. They fought back to equalise two minutes later. Ballack {{launched}} the ball to Drogba {{on the right-hand side}} of Arsenal’s penalty area. Diverting his markers who attempted to set the offside trap, Drogba took the ball and shot it past Manuel Almunia's goal to score. The equaliser led to Chelsea asserting themselves in the match as the team began to build up possession. Denílson, at the midway point of the half, received the game’s first yellow card for a foul on Essien; the Chelsea midfielder was later booked for a tackle on Baptista. Sticks of celery were thrown at Fàbregas before he took a corner close to stoppage time; targeting opponents with the vegetable was a Chelsea supporter’s ritual going back more than <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> <b>and</b> originated from song.|$|E

She also raced airplanes competitively during this period and won the 1957 Powder Puff Derby, capturing the first prize pot of $800 (approximately $ in present-day terms). In 1962, she joined Harvey Mudd College and, in association with the Bates Foundation, founded the school's Bates Aeronautics Program. She ran the program with her husband until he retired in 1979, and continued alone until the program ended with her 1990 retirement.
