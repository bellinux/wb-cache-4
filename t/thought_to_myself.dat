25|$|One day for {{the march}} I {{received}} this heavy old gun. A gun? And during a war? Never, I <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself.</b> And leaned it against a hut. And walked away. But that stood out even in our group at that time. I don't know now how I got away with it, but somehow it worked. And so I got by unarmed.|$|E

He told the Asthma Society of Ireland, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> this is something that I am {{just going to have to}} put up with." [...] In later years, however, improved medication has afforded Canavan what he described as, [...] "a better quality of life".|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} sessions {{served as}} the first production credit for Scott-Heron, Jackson, and Jose Williams. As the third unofficial collaboration between Scott-Heron and Jackson, the album's recording featured more of Jackson's input than before. Jackson recounted the experience in an interview for All About Jazz, stating [...] "He had this way with words and I <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> 'People have to hear this stuff'. What I had to offer was the music and I figured if we can take his words and make this tribal knowledge rhythmic and musical, we can draw people to hear it." ...|$|E

500|$|Turner {{was born}} in Simi Valley, California to parents John and Grace Turner. His father was the {{original}} drummer of the glam metal band Ratt. Chris Turner attended high school at the Chaminade College Preparatory School, {{where he was a}} three-year letterwinner and starting quarterback in football and pitcher in baseball. As a sophomore, he was on the junior varsity football team until midseason when the varsity quarterback suffered an injury against Valencia High School, a regional powerhouse. Turner described the incident as the last time that he was nervous during a game and said, [...] "It got pretty ugly to be honest. Ever since then, I've always <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> 'It can't get worse than that.'" ...|$|E
500|$|On August 23, Feldman threw seven {{scoreless}} innings {{while allowing}} only four hits in {{a win over}} the Tampa Bay Rays. It was his 13th win of the season (tied for third in the AL) and put his season record at 13–4. It was Feldman's ninth road win of the season (bringing him to 9–1 on the road), tying him with Sabathia for best in the AL. The win put the Rangers two games ahead of the Rays in the AL wild card standings, and one game behind the Red Sox. [...] His career-high 11 strikeouts were the most by a Ranger since Matt Perisho struck out 12 in 1999 (see [...] ). [...] Commenting on Feldman's last strikeout, Carlos Peña said: [...] "I was on second base, and I saw a pitch that he made to B. J. , and I was like, 'Wow.' I <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> 'That's unhittable right there.'" [...] Rays manager Joe Maddon called Feldman's performance [...] "the best-pitched game against us all year", in spite of Mark Buehrle's perfect game against them earlier in the season.|$|E
500|$|Michael Chabon (pronounced, in his words, [...] "Shea as in Shea Stadium, Bon as in Bon Jovi", i.e., [...] ) {{was born}} in Washington, DC to Robert Chabon, a {{physician}} and lawyer, and Sharon Chabon, a lawyer. Chabon said he {{knew he wanted to}} be a writer when, at the age of ten, he wrote his first short story for a class assignment. When the story received an A, Chabon recalls, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> 'That's it. That's what I want to do. I can do this.' And I never had any second thoughts or doubts." [...] Referring to popular culture, he wrote of being raised [...] "on a hearty diet of crap". His parents divorced when Chabon was 11, and he grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Columbia, Maryland. Columbia, where Chabon lived nine months of the year with his mother, was [...] "a progressive planned living community in which racial, economic, and religious diversity were actively fostered." [...] He has written of his mother's marijuana use, recalling her [...] "sometime around 1977 or so, sitting in the front seat of her friend Kathy's car, passing a little metal pipe back and forth before we went in to see a movie.". He grew up hearing Yiddish spoken by his mother's parents and siblings.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall wrote, [...] "It wasn't a perfect episode, mainly because Vivian remains a fairly muddled, bratty villain, and because I don't {{feel like the}} show ever really used Ray Wise to his full potential. But {{so much of it}} was so satisfying, both emotionally and comedically, that, until Vivian called Chuck during the rehearsal dinner, I actually <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> 'You know, this would be a pretty damn good finale in and of itself. Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club rated the episode a B on an A+ to F scale. McGee wrote, [...] "The last act was fairly phenomenal, but we had to get through a lot of troubling material in order to achieve true liftoff on the hour. With so many loose ends to wrap up, the hour felt overstuffed: the impending wedding, The Norseman, Agent X, Morgan's first field assignment...I mean, that's a lot of stuff. And it doesn't help that Vivian Volkoff {{is at the center of}} three of those things, and inserted herself into the fourth at the last moment. And in thinking about the clunkiness of aspects of this episode, I thought about the clunkiness of this latter half of the season as a whole." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8.5 out of 10, writing that it was a mistake not to include Timothy Dalton as Alexei Volkoff after the plot twists of the previous episode. Sarah Stegall of SFScope wrote, [...] "Chuck is killing me by inches. So close, so close to the Chuck/Sarah wedding, but things keep going wrong." ...|$|E

"Brigadier general Zvonko Stojanovski the {{commander}} of the Army Anti-air Defence informed me that our radars caught 6 fighter planes with course from Italy, through Albania towards Macedonia.

On opposition leadership, he said in 2008 that: [...] "The moment when I wanted to [...] was just about the first day I started in the job.

Could one bring a 'story' {{and a kind of}} theatre to the disco? Was that possible? If so, wouldn’t that be amazing!" ...|$|E

And as we all as a nation watch on television and together say aloud, `Bon voyage, Carolyn Parrish!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Badr Hari was {{fighting}} under the Dutch flag till {{he lost his}} match against Stefan Leko in 2005. It {{was the first time}} his parents attended one of his fights and he asked for the microphone to say some words to the Dutch audience. Hari couldn't be understood as the audience proceeded to boo him, after which Hari was quoted saying [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> I have never witnessed such ungratefulness". From that day Hari decided to represent Morocco and stopped working with Thom Harinck. Mike Passenier became his new coach.|$|E
2500|$|Fry {{struggled}} to keep his homosexuality secret during his teenage years at public school, and by his own account did not engage in sexual activity for 16 years from 1979 until 1995. When asked when he first acknowledged his sexuality, Fry quipped: [...] "I suppose it all began when I {{came out of the}} womb. I looked back up at my mother and <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> 'That's the last time I'm going up one of those'." [...] Fry was in a 15-year relationship with Daniel Cohen, which ended in 2010. In 2016, Fry was listed number 2 on the World Pride Power list.|$|E
60|$|My vaguely-prudent counsels were, {{naturally}} enough, not to {{the taste}} of my young hearers. Fritz openly acknowledged that I had disappointed him; and Minna turned aside her head, {{with a look of}} reproach. Her quick perception had detected, in my look and manner, that I was keeping my <b>thoughts</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself.</b> Neither she nor Fritz made any objection to my leaving them, to return to the office before post-time. I wrote to Mr. Engelman before I left my desk that evening.|$|R

2500|$|Francis {{was from}} his {{experiences}} suspicious {{and set up}} an extensive network of police spies and censors to monitor dissent (in this he was following his father's lead, as the Grand Duchy of Tuscany had the most effective secret police in Europe). [...] Even his family did not escape attention. [...] His brothers, the Archdukes Charles and Johann had their meetings and activities spied upon. [...] Censorship was also prevalent. [...] The author Franz Grillparzer, a Habsburg patriot, had one play suppressed solely as a [...] "precautionary" [...] measure.

People say that these things happen in wartime {{and that there is}} loyalty to the army and loyalty among the troops, which causes these things to disappear beneath the carpet. But I believe that we are betraying our real responsibility, which is to take these skeletons out of the closet, even if we think that the enemy has more skeletons than us. We must not be silent. We are all part of this terrible conspiracy of silence, and it is eating us up inside." ...|$|E
