Further work followed to the east of the tower between 1962 and 1964, uncovering the landing dock. Another project was carried out in 1994 and 1995, uncovering part of the original garden of the tower and the 16th century adjoining <b>timber</b> <b>house,</b> and an architectural survey between 2009 and 2011 determined that one of the wooden doors on the second floor was probably an original feature from 1365.|$|E

We were welcomed by as noble a Scot's face as I ever saw, and as keen a Scot's eye; and taken in and fed, horses and men, even too sumptuously, in a palm and <b>timber</b> <b>house.</b> Then we wandered out to see the site of his intended mansion, with the rich wooded hills of the Latagual to the north, and all around the unbroken forest, where, he told us, the howling monkeys shouted defiance morning and evening at him who did ...|$|E
60|$|It was a merciful {{disposition}} of Providence also, and which I have many times thought of at that time, that no fires, or no considerable ones at least, {{happened in the}} city during that year, which, {{if it had been}} otherwise, would have been very dreadful; and either the people must have let them alone unquenched, or have come together in great crowds and throngs, unconcerned at the danger of the infection, not concerned at the houses they went into, at the goods they handled, or at the persons or the people they came among. But so it was, that excepting that in Cripplegate parish, and two or three little eruptions of fires, which were presently extinguished, there was no disaster of that kind happened in the whole year. They told us a story of a house in a place called Swan Alley, passing from Goswell Street, near the end of Old Street, into St John Street, that a family was infected there in so terrible a manner that every one of the house died. The last person lay dead on the floor, and, as it is supposed, had lain herself all along to die just before the fire; the fire, it seems, had fallen from its place, being of wood, and had taken hold of the boards and the joists they lay on, and burnt as far as just to the body, but had not taken hold of the dead body (though she had little more than her shift on) and had gone out of itself, not burning the rest of the house, though it was a slight <b>timber</b> <b>house.</b> How true this might be I do not determine, but the city being to suffer severely the next year by fire, this year it felt very little of that calamity.|$|E

6000|$|After walking {{round the}} cathedral, {{we went up}} a narrow and crooked street, very old and shabby, but with an antique house {{projecting}} {{as much as a}} yard over the pavement on one side,--a <b>timber</b> <b>house</b> it seemed to be, plastered over and stained yellow or buff. There was no external door, affording entrance into this edifice; but about midway of its front we came to a low, Gothic, stone archway, passing right through the house; and as it looked much time-worn, and was sculptured with untraceable devices, we went through. There was an exceedingly antique, battered, and shattered pair of oaken leaves, which used doubtless to shut up the passage in former times, and keep it secure; but for the last centuries, probably, there has been free ingress and egress. Indeed, the portal arch may never have been closed since the Reformation. Within, we found a quadrangle, of which the house upon the street formed one side, the others being composed of ancient houses, with gables in a row, all looking upon the paved quadrangle, through quaint windows of various fashion. An elderly, neat, pleasant-looking woman now came in beneath the arch, and as she had a look of being acquainted here, we asked her what the place was; and she told us, that in the old Popish times the prebends of the cathedral used to live here, to keep them from doing mischief in the town. The establishment, she said, was now called [...] "The College," [...] and was let in rooms and small tenements to poor people. On consulting the York Guide, I find that her account was pretty correct; the house having been founded in Henry VI.'s time, and called St. William's College, the statue of the patron saint being sculptured over the arch. It was intended for the residence of the parsons and priests of the cathedral, who had formerly caused troubles and scandals by living in the town.|$|E
60|$|I {{was then}} curious, indeed, to see it; and when I came to it, {{it was nothing}} but this: it was a <b>timber</b> <b>house,</b> or a house built, as we call it in England, with lath and plaster, but all this {{plastering}} was really China ware--that is to say, it was plastered with the earth that makes China ware. The outside, which the sun shone hot upon, was glazed, and looked very well, perfectly white, and painted with blue figures, as the large China ware in England is painted, and hard {{as if it had}} been burnt. As to the inside, all the walls, instead of wainscot, were lined with hardened and painted tiles, like the little square tiles we call galley- tiles in England, all made of the finest china, and the figures exceeding fine indeed, with extraordinary variety of colours, mixed with gold, many tiles making but one figure, but joined so artificially, the mortar being made of the same earth, that it was very hard to see where the tiles met. The floors of the rooms were of the same composition, and as hard as the earthen floors we have in use in several parts of England; as hard as stone, and smooth, but not burnt and painted, except some smaller rooms, like closets, which were all, as it were, paved with the same tile; the ceiling and all the plastering work in the whole house were of the same earth; and, after all, the roof was covered with tiles of the same, but of a deep shining black. This was a China warehouse indeed, truly and literally to be called so, and had I not been upon the journey, I could have stayed some days to see and examine the particulars of it. They told me there were fountains and fishponds in the garden, all paved on the bottom and sides with the same; and fine statues set up in rows on the walks, entirely formed of the porcelain earth, burnt whole.|$|E

During the last twelve years around 20000 apartments have been built in Sweden using industrialized <b>timber</b> <b>housing</b> techniques.

40|$|Increased {{cost and}} declining quality within the {{construction}} industry {{has resulted in a}} growing interest in industrialised housing construction. During the past 15 years Swedish <b>timber</b> <b>housing</b> has been in a start-up phase where the frame system has been adapted to fulfil the demands of the building regulations. Still, potential clients and building owners are uncertain of long-term financial costs and functional performance of <b>timber</b> <b>houses.</b> To take <b>timber</b> frame <b>housing</b> from the level of unique experimental projects to competitive industrialised production, manufacturers will have to face the challenge of convincing the market that timber is an equally sufficient frame material as the more traditional concrete and steel. This paper presents a summary and analysis of the research conducted within the field of industrialised <b>timber</b> <b>housing</b> at Lule√• University of Technology. The summary is made through a literature review of research reports, theses, papers and statistic references. The results are put in relation to lean theories and the development of industrialised <b>timber</b> <b>housing</b> in Sweden, with the aim of establishing current knowledge and identifying future research needs. Industrialised housing in Sweden is a growing market with good potential to provide low-cost housing of good quality. The results points out organising the design process to support production, working on customer interaction and to providing information that decreases the uncertainty for future customers as challenges for the industrialised house builders. Further research within industrialised housing should address the quality concept in housing, reduction of uncertainties in customer relations and new business models. Support of the technical development with efficient stabilisation methods for high-rise buildings and simple joining methods during assembly is another important issue.
