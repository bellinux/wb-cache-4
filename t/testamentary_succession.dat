Czech Civil Code deals with regulation of inheritance law sections significantly less than the German Civil Code. While studying both legal systems I discovered many differences, especially in the organization of the possible contents of the testament. In Germany, as opposed to the Czech Republic, the testator in the testament can validly give such condition, order or the reference. Forms of regulation of testament are also different, German peculiarity is so called common testament of spouses. In general, the German legislature honors principle of autonomy of the will of the testator, his test freedom, much more than the Czech. Prepared codification of the new Czech Civil Code is inspired by our German neighbors and is returning to traditional institutes of inheritance rights, autonomy of the testator significantly is strengthened.

The purpose of my thesis is to analyse the institution of testate succession. Actually there are two possibilities of inheritance succession. The first is an intestate succession and the alternative is constituted by a testate succession. Although in the Civil Code there is mentioned the intestate succession in the first place, testate succession holds the first position in practice. In fact legal heirs succeed if a deceased doesn't leave any testament. The exception is represented by forced heirs. The legal grounds to the <b>testamentary</b> <b>succession</b> there is a testament, sometimes called a will of deceased, too.

40|$|Thesis {{abstract}} Matter of Inheritance in Private and Public Law. Law of inheritance {{is one of}} {{the most}} important areas of proprietary laws, which proves the fact, that the inheritance regulation in the form of hereditary rights (legal succession and <b>testamentary</b> <b>succession),</b> has already been regulated in Roman law. Death of a person as a family member, pertinently a testator, represents for the descendants a sad and grieving event in most cases, despite the fact it belong to inevitable natural rules. In regards to the fact that every single person is bound to set up for his last journey, the inheritance matter has always been and always will be a topical issue regardless the fact of the testator leaving or not leaving any property. Inheritance legal regulation has undergone a long development under continuous relevant attention of the society. In times when law was not in writing, there were the customs replacing it, later on the first codifications and other newer and newer legal regulations that kept changing and improving. This trend has continued up to this date. Evolution of inheritance law in the form of new legal regulations has not stopped and crosses the borders of the Czech Republic. The thesis deals with this matter in historical context of inheritance law, not only during the Middle Ages and a [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The Civil Code {{provisions}} on succession by will, {{unlike the}} regulation of the intestate succession, do not give a definite answer as to whether a divorced spouse inherits after his/her ex-spouse by virtue of a testament drawn before the divorce. In some foreign legal systems the legislators not only stipulated the norms allowing the decedent to amend or cancell his/her will, but adopted the regulation according to which the very fact of divorce or even marital breakdown excludes the ex- -spouse from inheriting by virtue of a testament drawn prior to divorce. Trying to find a legal basis to exclude a divorced spouse from <b>testamentary</b> <b>succession,</b> one should point out to the provisions on error. Although {{at a time of}} drawing a will no defects can be found, the evaluation as to the existence of error in a testament must be carried out with reference to events which occured after the will had been drawn. Thus since in a typical case a decedent must consider divorce unexpected at a time of his/her drawing the will, subsequent divorce renders the stipulations Of a testament to have been drawn in error. A testament drawn in error is void. A court will have to assess whether the invalidity pertains to the entire testament or only to the stipulations in favour of the ex-spouse.

40|$|The Polish law on {{agriculture}} can be classed among those branches of law {{which are still}} raising objections on some of their provisions. This situation creates a stimuli for making transformations of the regulation. Recent amendments of the Civil Code are the first steps toward reform. The Act of 26 March, 1982 (The Legal Gazette — Dz. U. 11 sec. 81) has modified the two branches of civil law: property law and law of inheretance. In some parts the previous changes are continuing the legislational policy, but in some other they present new solutions. In no doubt the change of sec. 131 of the civil code (hereinafter called the c. c.) is most substantial, it is realizing the postulate of consolidation of the individual agrarian property. The wording of the provision though, especially when confronted with sec. 129 of the c. c. is questionable. Notions used by the legislator are still not precise i. e. the complete (sec. 131 of the c. c.) and the particular (sec. 129 of the c. c.) protection. Sec. 160 of the c. c. has clearly specified the prerequisites which have to be satisfied, according to the code, by the vendee of a country (agricultural) estate: it can be any person excercising a farmer profession (in a broad meaning of the term) or having theoretical qualifications. Therefore certain subjects are no more discriminated, eg. employers of the state agricultural enterprises. The new regulation (sec. 161) has also {{put an end to}} the stereotype understanding of the question of size of an individual farm. That question was normalized in a long awaited way, which can answer to the reality and needs of the present day. The maximum size of the individual farm can reach 100 ha of general area. The rules of dividing farms in consequence of transfer of agricultural estate property rights (sec. 163). Changes in the regulation of dissolution of co- ownership are not substantial and they are corresponding to the modifications of sec. 160. The extension of circle of heirs is a novelty in the regulation of farm succession, that circle is presently equal to the circle of statutory heirs inheriting on general principles. The sequence of succession is determined now by sec. 931 et al. of the c. c., the main condition being qualifications necessary for the acquisition of a property right, as well as majority and permanent inability to work. In case of <b>testamentary</b> <b>succession</b> of farms the amendments returned the rules of "normal" taking of bona vacantia. In the instance of a sole succession of persons permanently incapable of work, the farm is inherited by all successors on the basis of the general order of inheritance. There are slight modifications carried out in <b>testamentary</b> <b>succession</b> of farms (sec. 1065 of the c. c.) and in the distribution of an inheritance. In principle, both are a consequence of property law provisions which were adopted earlier and of sec. 1059 of the c. c. The regulation of succession — as opposed to the 1971 amendments of the c. c. — are not retroactive and they are valid from the day of enactment of the law, i. e. 6 April, 1982.

40|$|The {{contemporary}} Polish village requires {{and expects}} a modernisation in practically {{all areas of}} its activities and activeness. It is the young generation that is to play the greatest part {{in the process of}} structural changes in the Polish country. A rejuvenation of farming is not only desirable, but necessary, and it should be consciously stimulated. Yet a doubt appears if the generation change in farming is not taking place at the cost of an infringement of the interests of the nearest family. The problem is analised {{on the basis of the}} Social Security of Individual Farmers Act of 14 December, 1982, (Government Regulations and Laws Gazette 40, pos. 268), and the Civil Code provisions for the inheriting of farms. Furthermore, it seems that the problem is topical only in those families in which there appear conflicts; in families of close bonds the legal regulation of certain social relations is not an obstacle to patterns of behaviour preserved in village tradition. As far as the retirement pension act is concernred members of the transferring farmer's family are not entitled to any claims against the one who transfers as well as against the recipient. The Act determines only what the duties of the recipient towards the one who transfers are, the range of which are, besides, very limited; their bulk is taken over by the state. The Act further, does not mention any possible settlement of accounts between the recipient of the farm and the family of the transferring farmer, in the event of the latter's death. There is an evident gap in the act in this respect. De lege lata there exists only the slightest hope that in the event of such a death, an inheritance would be left in which the farmer's successor would participate. A number of changes have been introduced with respect to succession to farms in the course of the last two decades, which testify to a certain openness, on the legislator's part, to reality, although in all that time he or she has remained faithful to the conception that the successor to a farm must comply with additional prerequisites. What deserves special notice is, first of all, the widened range of those entitled to statutory succession and, secondly the possibility of succeeding to a farm on general terms. On the other hand, one can observe that present regulations pay only a very scant attention to the contribution the testator's family make to the creation of the inherited objects by decidedly favouring socio-economic reasons. It seems that practice should follow a more liberal interpretation of the provisions for the succession to farms. A guideline might be sought in the instructions to the administration of justice and to judicial practice expressed in a Supreme Court resolution of 1968. In cases of a statutory succession to farms, a somewhat singular issue appears in the form of succession by so-called specific replacement. In view of the fact that in a given situation the more far-off members of the testator's family might participate in the succession, for e. g. the descendants of brothers and sisters, this type of succession is an occasion when tension in the family might appear, although also in this case the gist of the problem lies in the conditions to be met by the successor to the farm. In cases of <b>testamentary</b> <b>succession</b> the very principle of freedom of bequest is a potential source of misunderstandings and might lead to those members of the family not appointed as heirs being injured. But also in such cases, the successor must possess specific attributes entitling him to the appointment. Should those be lacking, it might turn out that statutory succession would take place, which would alleviate somewhat the distress connected with bequething. What turns out to be rather ineffective in <b>testamentary</b> <b>succession</b> to farms is the institution of legitimate portions, as here also those who might wish to gain from it, have to conform to certain prerequisites as potential heirs. Quite serious irregularities might be observed in distributive proceedings. They resolve themselves into an assessment of the inherited farm's capacity of payment by installments, to the lowering of payments. The legislator appears here as the protector of the farmer obliged to payments, whereas the farmer and both the testator's and the obliged farmer's family are all entitled.

40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Estate Law)) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2003. The Constitution of the Republic of South Afi'ica, 1996 {{acknowledges}} the customary system of law directly (section 211) {{and the religious}} based systems of law indirectly (section 15 (3)). The objective of estate planning is to assure the most benefit, use and enjoyment of possessions for the owner with emphasis on the reduction of income and estate tax. The question to be addressed is whether the variety of matrimonial dispensations in South Africa have an influence on estate planning within the Constitutional order. The comparative method is used to achieve this objective by comparing the Islam, Hindu, African Customary law and the Common law matrimonial dispensations. The study {{is based on a}} literature'study. According to. Islam law a woman is inferior to a man. All marriages are concluded out of community of property. A woman may hold property but her husband has control over it. She is entitled to a dowry. Muslim marriages are potentially polygamous. A Hindu woman never reaches majority and the concept of in or out of community of property does not exist in Hindu law. Property belonging to women is divided into two groups namely stridhana and the limited female estate. Hindu marriages are potentially polygamous. According to the customary law a woman has a lesser status than a man but the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act 120 of 1998 rectifies the situation by declaring man and woman equal. Indigenous women are thus allowed to own property. The concept of in or out of community of property is unknown to customary law but the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act 120 of 1998 states that all marriages concluded after the commencement of the Act will be in community of property and in community of profit and loss unless an antenuptial contract is drawn up stating otherwise. Indigenous marriages are potentially polygamous. Only monogamous marriages are acknowledged in Common law. All marriages are in community of property and profit and loss unless stated otherwise in an antenuptial contract. The Fourth Law Amendment Act 132 of 1993 declared men and women equal in all matters. With regard to estate planning the following remarks can be made. <b>Testamentary</b> <b>succession</b> in Muslim law is limited to one-third of the property owned by the deceased. The remaining two-thirds of the property is divided according to the rules of intestate succession. Women may inherent only half as much as men. Muslim law is not recognised in South Africa and a testator will have to set up a trust to ensure that his wishes are fulfilled. In Hindu law the man only has a limited freedom of testation regarding the joint family property. Likewise, the woman only has freedom of testation regarding her stridhana. Hindu law is not recognised in South Africa and a testator will have to set up a trust to ensure that his wishes are fulfilled. A person married according to customary law does not have freedom of testation regarding movable property. There are certain rules in customary law determining the way in which estates should be divided. According to the Nguni, the eldest son of the first wife of the testator not only inherits the estate, but also the status as head of the family and the joint family estate. Women are not allowed to inherit property. According to the common law of South Africa, trusts are frequently used as estate planning instruments. Trusts have large advantages when it comes to estate planning and tax reductions. Section 4 (q) of the Estate Planning Act 45 of 1955 provides that all bequests made to the surviving spouse are exempt from tax. The fact that Muslim and Hindu marriages are not recognised in South African law means that this provision is not applicable to them. By setting up trusts, Muslims and Hindus can ensure that their wives are financially taken care of. The women and/or daughters can be appointed as income beneficiaries and the children as capital beneficiaries. The customary law testator can ensure that all his children are treated equally by appointing not only his eldest son, but all his children, as capital beneficiaries. He can set up a trust for each of his wives {{in the case of a}} polygamous marriage, thereby ensuring that each of them receive income after his death. The conclusion is that the type of matrimonial dispensation according to which one is married, definitely has an influence on estate planning. It does not seem possible to create a family law system which will please all the people of our rainbow nation because of all the different cultures that exist. Master...|$|E
