5|$|As American forces {{continued}} to approach Luzon, the Japanese Imperial High Command ordered that all able-bodied POWs be transported to Japan. From the Cabanatuan camp, over 1,600 soldiers were removed in October1944, leaving over 500sick, weak, or disabled POWs. On January6, 1945, {{all of the}} guards withdrew from the Cabanatuan camp, leaving the POWs alone. The guards had previously told prisoner leaders {{that they should not}} attempt to escape, or else they would be killed. When the guards left, <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> heeded the threat, fearing that the Japanese were waiting near the camp and would use the attempted escape as an excuse to execute them all. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> went to the guards' side of the camp and ransacked the Japanese buildings for supplies and large amounts of food. Prisoners were alone for several weeks, except when retreating Japanese forces would periodically stay in the camp. The soldiers mainly ignored the POWs, except to ask for food. Although aware of the consequences, <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> sent a small group outside the prison's gates to bring in twocarabaos to slaughter. The meat from the animals, along with the food secured from the Japanese side of the camp, helped many of the POWs to regain their strength, weight, and stamina. In mid-January, a large group of Japanese troops entered the camp and returned <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> to their side of the camp. <b>The</b> <b>prisoners,</b> fueled by rumors, speculated that they would soon be executed by the Japanese.|$|E

5|$|At about 18:00, <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> {{were divided}} into groups. Each group of 10 to 20 was loaded onto a truck and transported several hundred metres (yards) from the {{building}} towards a wooded ravine. When <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> reached the previously prepared execution site, they were shot and buried in a mass grave using a bulldozer. After 15–20 minutes, the truck would return empty {{to pick up the}} next group. The final group of prisoners was executed just outside the farm building itself. By 22:00 that evening, all of <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> had been killed. Most sources place the number of victims at around 260. This figure has been used by ICTY prosecutors. Some estimates of the death toll go as high as 264. The Croatian authorities believe that the total figure stands at 261. The massacre was the most severe individual war crime committed in Europe since World War II until that point.|$|E
5|$|Between late February {{and early}} March 1945, with {{the advance of}} the Allied armies, all {{production}} of notes at Sachsenhausen ceased. The equipment and supplies were packed and transported, with <b>the</b> <b>prisoners,</b> to the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp in Austria, arriving on 12 March. Shortly afterwards Krüger arranged for a further transfer to the Redl-Zipf series of tunnels where they were to restart production. The order to resume production was soon rescinded, and <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> were ordered to destroy the cases of money they had with them. That which was not burnt by <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> was loaded onto trucks with the printing equipment and sunk in the Toplitz and Grundlsee lakes.|$|E
5|$|Krüger visited {{several other}} {{concentration}} camps {{to assemble the}} people he needed, primarily selecting those with skills in draftsmanship, engraving, printing and banking. In September 1942 the first 26 prisoners for Operation Bernhard arrived at Sachsenhausen; 80 more arrived in December. When met by Krüger, he called them in the formal and polite form , rather than the more demeaning , which was normally used when the Nazis spoke to a Jew. Several of <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> selected later reported that Krüger had interviewed them for the role, and treated them with politeness and good manners. He also provided <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> with cigarettes, newspapers, extra rations and a radio. Prisoners had a ping pong table, and they would play with the guards and among themselves; evenings of amateur theatricals also took place, staged by <b>the</b> <b>prisoners,</b> with a mixed audience of guards and counterfeiters; Krüger provided musicians for musical numbers.|$|E

5|$|Later on 20 November, Šljivančanin and Colonel Nebojša Pavković {{informed}} {{the press that}} the JNA would provide buses to transport the wounded out of Vukovar. Instead, at about 10:30, the buses took <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> to the JNA barracks on {{the southern edge of}} Vukovar, where 15 men were separated from the group and returned to the hospital after being identified as hospital staff. During their stay in the barracks, the Croatian Serb TO and Serbian paramilitaries threatened <b>the</b> <b>prisoners.</b> Croatian Serb leaders opposed moving <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> to detention facilities in Serbia, claiming they wished to prosecute them for alleged crimes committed against Serbs. After spending two hours at the barracks, the buses took <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> to the Ovčara farm near the village of Grabovo. The group largely consisted of Croats, but also included several ethnic Serbs, Muslims, ethnic Hungarians, the French national Nicolier, and one German national who fought in defence of Vukovar. It also included Rašeta's nephew, who worked at the Vukovar hospital pharmacy at the time. The group of taken to Ovčara consisted of 261 people. Sources disagree as to whether the group included one, or two women, one of whom was five months pregnant. The age of <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> ranged from 16 to 72. The youngest among them was 16-year-old Igor Kačić.|$|E
5|$|Many of <b>the</b> <b>{{prisoner}}s</b> were {{marched to}} the city of Trier, with the march taking as long as 20 days.

5|$|A second {{mandatory}} {{roll call}} {{took place in}} the evening. If a prisoner was missing, the others had to remain standing in place until he was either found or the reason for his absence discovered, regardless of the weather conditions, even if it took hours. After roll call, individual and collective punishments were meted out, depending on what had happened during the day, before <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> were allowed to retire to their blocks for the night and receive their bread rations and water. Curfew was two or three hours later. <b>The</b> <b>prisoners</b> slept in long rows of wooden bunks, lying in and on their clothes and shoes to prevent them from being stolen.|$|E

5|$|After {{approximately}} three hours, the negotiations broke down, and that night's evening meal was withheld. That caused <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> to riot, breaking fittings; during the commotion, three prison officers, three prisoners, and a detective sustained injuries.

The extent of the damage was in the order of $200 to $300. To relieve the overcrowding and reduce prisoner agitation, around 60 men who had not taken part in the riot were transferred to prisons at Albany, Geraldton, Karnet, and Barton's Mill. However, other improvements could not be undertaken without funding from the state government, which did not consider prison reform a priority.|$|E
5|$|American {{officials}} {{decided to}} release <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> {{after a few}} weeks. First, however, the Natives were required to visit several large U.S. cities on the east coast. This was a tactic often used when Native American leaders came to the East, because {{it was thought that}} a demonstration of the size and power of the United States would discourage future resistance to U.S. expansion. Beginning on June 4, 1833, Black Hawk and his companions were taken on a tour of Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City. They attended dinners and plays, and were shown a battleship, various public buildings, and a military parade. Huge crowds gathered to see them. Black Hawk's handsome son Nasheweskaska (Whirling Thunder) was a particular favorite. Reaction in the west, however, was less welcoming.

At nearly 4:00 pm the lorry drove towards the main gate of the prison, where <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> {{intended}} to take over the gatehouse. Ten prisoners dressed in guards' uniforms and armed with guns and chisels dismounted from the lorry and entered the gatehouse, where they took the officers hostage.

When other staff responded via an intercom, a senior officer said while being held at gunpoint that the alarm had been triggered accidentally. By this time <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> were struggling to maintain control in the gatehouse due to the number of hostages.

The truck delivered the first two groups to the camp, where the men were housed separately from the general camp population. On the third journey the vehicle broke down after it had picked up the final group of prisoners; the men in the last group were marched to the camp, which took two days. As the order had specified that <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> had to be killed together, the first two groups were kept safe to await their comrades. Because of the delay with the third journey and the close proximity of the advancing Allied army, on 5 May the first two groups were released from their isolation into the general population and their SS guards fled. That afternoon the third group arrived at the camp. When the guards learned {{what had happened to the}} first two groups, they also released their prisoners into the main prison population and fled.
