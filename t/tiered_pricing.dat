500|$|U2 manager Paul McGuinness confessed {{anxiety over}} initial ticket sales taking {{place during the}} late 2000s recession. Drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. said, [...] "Will we sell it out? Who knows? Will the {{economic}} situation have an impact? Probably. But that's {{not going to stop}} us." [...] Bono said, [...] "I want to put on an extraordinary show, but I’d like to own my house when it's over." [...] The tour featured a <b>tiered</b> <b>pricing</b> system for tickets; the most expensive ticket being slightly higher in price than the last tour, but the cheapest tickets, the general admission tickets, being lower. Playing larger capacity venues allowed the band to price tickets more conservatively and subsidise less expensive tickets with costlier ones. In the US, field level tickets were priced at $55, and approximately 10,000 tickets per show were priced at $30. The price points were $30, $55, and depending on the market, $90–95 and $250. McGuinness said, [...] "We have worked very hard to ensure that U2 fans can purchase a great-priced ticket with a guaranteed great view." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We model how Internet Service Providers design <b>tier</b> rates, <b>tier</b> <b>prices,</b> {{and network}} capacity. Web {{browsing}} and video streaming are considered {{as the two}} dominant Internet applications. We propose a novel set of utility functions that depend on a user’s willingness to pay for each application, the performance of each application, and the time devoted to each application. For a monopoly provider, the demand function for each tier is derived {{as a function of}} <b>tier</b> <b>price</b> and performance. We first give conditions for the <b>tier</b> rates, <b>tier</b> <b>prices,</b> and network capacity that maximize Internet Service Provider profit, defined as subscription revenue minus capacity cost. We then show how an Internet Service Provider may simplify tier and capacity design, by allowing their engineering department to set network capacity, their marketing department to set <b>tier</b> <b>prices,</b> and both to jointly set tier rates. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the magnitude of the decrease in profit resulting from such a simplified design.

40|$|Abstract — We propose {{models to}} {{evaluate}} the impact of data caps upon subscribers and Internet Service Providers (ISPs). These models incorporate the time users devote to Internet applications and the opportunity cost of a user’s free time. We consider a monopoly ISP that maximizes profit by setting <b>tier</b> <b>prices,</b> <b>tier</b> rates, network capacity, data caps, and overage charges. We illustrate which users are affected by data caps, and the resulting impact upon both users and ISPs. We show that an ISP will increase the tier rate and decrease the <b>tier</b> <b>price</b> when data caps are used to maximize profit. We give numerical results to illustrate the increase in ISP profit when data caps are used, and the corresponding changes in user and social welfare.

40|$|The {{electricity}} {{pricing structure}} in Texas has changed after deregulation (January 2002). The Energy Systems Laboratory {{has served as}} a technical consultant on electricity purchases to several universities in the Texas A&M University System since 2001. In the fiscal year of 2006 Stephen F. Austin State University joined with the TAMU campuses and agencies, and there are now 183 accounts in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) North, Northeast, South, West, and Houston areas of Texas. From the 183 accounts, 9 Interval Data Recorder (IDR) accounts consume 92 % of the total load. The objective of this research is to find the most economic price structure to purchase electricity for the Texas A&M System and Stephen F. Austin University by analyzing various pricing scenarios: the spot market, forward contracts, take or pay contracts and on/off season (tiered) contracts. The analysis was based on the 9 IDR accounts. The prices for the spot market were given by ERCOT and the other prices by Sempra. The energy charges were calculated every 15 minute using the real historical consumption of each facility and the aggregated load of all facilities. The result for the analysis was given for each institution separately, {{as well as for the}} aggregated load of all facilities. The results of the analysis showed that the <b>tiered</b> <b>price</b> was the most economical structure to purchase electricity for each individual university and for the total aggregated load of all 9 IDR accounts. From March 1, 2005 to February 28, 2006, purchasing electricity on the <b>tiered</b> <b>price</b> would have cost $ 13, 810, 560. The forward contract, that is, purchasing electricity on a fixed rate, was the next cheapest with an energy cost of $ 14, 266, 870 from March 1, 2005 to February 28, 2006, 3 % higher than purchasing electricity at the <b>tiered</b> <b>price.</b> The most expensive method to purchase electricity would have been the spot market. Its energy costs would have been approximately $ 18, 171, 610, 36 % and 31 % higher, respectively, than purchasing electricity at the <b>tiered</b> <b>price</b> and the fixed rate...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} competitive pricing strategies of apparel brands and retailers. Design/methodology/approach – The paper begins with a broad discussion of competition by examining Porter’s five forces model, and narrows by examining price competition within <b>price</b> <b>tiers</b> in the retail apparel industry according to store format and brands. Included are case studies of apparel retailers and brands incorporating concepts of pricing strategies, brand positioning, and price competition, with a focus on retail channel relationships. The paper analyzes the impact of price competition on apparel retailers and brands, and further examines <b>price</b> <b>tiers</b> as a competitive strategy. Findings – The study reveals that the concept of <b>price</b> <b>tiers</b> is applicable to apparel retailers and brands. <b>Price</b> <b>tiering</b> is a vehicle for market positioning for the retail apparel industry. Retailers are enacting a <b>price</b> <b>tier</b> strategy by branding their retail store formats or engaging store brands as a vehicle of differentiation for a tier. Retailers and brands can be successful with a <b>price</b> <b>tier</b> strategy, unless they fail to differentiate between tiers on factors other than on price alone. Research limitations/implications – The lack of relevant price competition literature, relating to the retailer apparel industry, forced the exploration of price competition literature from grocery and automotive sectors. Originality/value – The paper provides useful information on the impact of price competition on apparel retailers and brands, and also <b>price</b> <b>tiers</b> as a competitive strategy...|$|R

40|$|Purpose — This {{paper has}} two purposes: to use {{polarisation}} to identify variations in loyalty and to apply polarisation {{to an important}} non-brand attribute, price. Design/methodology/approach — A comprehensive revealed preference data set of wine purchases is used to apply polarisation. Polarisation was defined in two ways: {{as a function of}} the beta binomial distribution (BBD) to give a measure of loyalty for an alternative; and {{as a function of the}} Dirichlet multinomial distribution (DMD) to give a baseline level of loyalty. Variations were identified by analysing the differences between the BBD and DMD. Findings — Polarisation was shown to be one way of identifying variation across <b>price</b> <b>tiers.</b> In the empirical example used, the DMD model is violated with the <b>price</b> <b>tiers</b> not being directly substitutable with one another. Buyers show excess loyalty towards the lowest and highest <b>price</b> <b>tier</b> levels. One tier shows ‘change-of-pace’ loyalty. Small brands do better when they focus on high loyalty tiers, middle brands compete in the change-of-pace tier and large brands do well across all tiers. Originality/value — Very little work has been undertaken into <b>price</b> <b>tier</b> loyalty and no known empirical research has been undertaken into behavioural loyalty to <b>price</b> <b>tiers</b> in wine. Very little empirical research has considered the association between excess loyalty for attribute levels (such as <b>price</b> <b>tiers)</b> and the existence of niche, change-of-pace and reinforcing brands.

40|$|We use vector error {{correction}} models {{to examine the}} interdependence between the high and the low <b>price</b> <b>tiers</b> during the latest housing market boom and bust. For 118 of the 364 US statistical areas analyzed, the <b>tiered</b> <b>price</b> indexes are bound by a long-run relationship. In general, low tier homes appreciated more than high tier homes {{in the past two}} decades. In contrast to previous periods of high volatility, however, low tier homes appreciated more during the boom and lost more value during the bust of the market. We find a shift in the long-run equilibrium during the bubble —the cointegration parameter that ties the tiers together is greater in absolute value during the bubble period compared to the periods of more moderate appreciation and depreciation rates. Moreover, the shift in the long-run equilibrium can be explained by differences in subprime originations across housing markets. We also find that short run price dynamics is driven by momentum in both segments of the market...|$|R
40|$|The Polarisation index, {{developed}} by Sabavala, Morrison and Kalwani, {{is a well-known}} measure of loyalty for repeated discrete choices (Brown et al. 2003). The index refers to choices between two alternatives, but is utilised to show deviations from loyalty in a multiple alternative setting. The index can range between zero and one, where zero indicates pure homogeneity in consumer choice and one indicates maximal heterogeneity among consumers (Fader and Schmittlein 1993). Normal academic research into Polarisation {{has focused on the}} unit of analysis as the brand. Given the ability of the index to handle two choice alternatives within multiple alternative settings, and therefore the ability to combine alternatives, this paper applies the index to <b>price</b> <b>tiers.</b> The authors develop polarisations for a number of <b>price</b> <b>tiers</b> and compare these to the market shares for each. Using purchase data from Australia and taking bottled wine as an example, the authors show higher polarisations for the $ 17. 50 <b>price</b> <b>tier.</b> The commercial <b>price</b> <b>tier,</b> where loyalty is in line with market share is $ 7. 50 -$ 12. 49. In this paper, the authors explain the methodology behind these findings and discuss the results in relation to a large brand and a niche brand marketing content.
