5|$|As {{the oldest}} parts of Monte Testaccio {{are at the}} bottom of the mound, it is {{difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>with</b> any certainty when it was first created. Deposits found by excavators have been dated to a period between approximately AD 140 to 250, but it is possible that dumping could have begun on the site as early as the 1st century BC. The mound has a roughly triangular shape comprising two distinct platforms, the eastern side being the oldest. At least four distinct series of terraces were built in a stepped arrangement. Layers of small sherds were laid down in some places, possibly to serve as paths for those carrying out the waste disposal operations.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} {{scholars}} have postulated {{a number of}} theories about what Stowe was trying <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>with</b> the novel (aside from the obvious themes, such as condemning slavery). For example, as an ardent Christian and active abolitionist, Stowe placed many of her religious beliefs into the novel. Some scholars have stated that Stowe saw her novel as offering {{a solution to the}} moral and political dilemma that troubled many slavery opponents: whether engaging in prohibited behavior was justified in opposing evil. Was the use of violence to oppose the violence of slavery and the breaking of proslavery laws morally defensible? Which of Stowe's characters should be emulated, the passive Uncle Tom or the defiant George Harris? Stowe's solution was similar to Ralph Waldo Emerson's: God's will would be followed if each person sincerely examined his principles and acted on them.|$|E
25|$|Devotion to the Sacred Heart {{developed}} out of {{the devotion}} to the Holy Wounds, in particular to the Sacred Wound {{in the side of}} Jesus. The first indications of devotion to the Sacred Heart are found in the eleventh and twelfth centuries in the fervent atmosphere of the Benedictine or Cistercian monasteries, in the world of Bernardine thought. But it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>with</b> certainty what were its first texts or who were its first devotees.|$|E

It is likely that a photograph (including a scan – digital scanning counts as photography {{for the purposes of the}} Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988) of a two dimensional artistic work, such as another photograph or a painting will also be subject to copyright if a significant amount of skill, labour and judgment went into its creation.|$|E
25|$|Enough {{is known}} about Brazilian fungi <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>with</b> {{confidence}} {{that the number of}} native species must be very high and very diverse: in work almost entirely limited to the state of Pernambuco, during the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s, more than 3300 species were observed by a single group of mycologists Given that current best estimates suggest only about 7% of the world's true diversity of fungal species has so far been discovered, with most of the known species having been described from temperate regions, the number of fungal species occurring in Brazil is likely to be far higher.|$|E

Among those inventions that are credited with passing into general practical use are the strut bridge, the automated bobbin winder, the rolling mill, the machine for testing the tensile strength of wire and the lens-grinding machine pictured at right. In the lens-grinding machine, the hand rotation of the grinding wheel operates an angle-gear, which rotates a shaft, turning a geared dish in which sits the glass or crystal to be ground. A single action rotates both surfaces at a fixed speed ratio determined by the gear.|$|E

[...] He continues saying that [...] "what Marvel's daring <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>with</b> this season finale is [...] "everything we do matters, and you need to pay attention to all of it." ... It's been a long journey, and there's no question many viewers' patience wore thin toward the end, but that never stopped Marvel from pushing forward to one of the most entertaining hours of television this season and finally cementing a deserved place on the small screen." ...|$|E

500|$|Nellie {{does not}} sing {{together}} with Emile, because Rodgers promised Martin {{that she would}} not have to compete vocally with Pinza, but the composer sought to unite them in the underlying music. [...] A tetrachord, heard before we see either lead, is played during the instrumental introduction to [...] "Dites-Moi", the show's first song. [...] Considered as pitch classes, that is, as pitches without characterization by octave or register, the motif is C-B-A-G. It will be heard repeatedly in Nellie's music, or in the music (such as [...] "Twin Soliloquies") that she shares with Emile, and even in the bridge of [...] "Some Enchanted Evening".

The {{remaining}} troops of the 2nd Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry and 'A' Company, 12th Battalion, Devonshire Regiment landed at LZW. Given the limited availability of aircraft, even two lifts did not provide capacity to transport all of the Devonshire battalion, the rest of whom arrived by sea on 7June. The 6th Airlanding Brigade headquarters, 1st Battalion, Royal Ulster Rifles and the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment landed at LZN, the latter equipped with the Tetrarch light tank– the first time that any tank had been flown into battle by air. Watching the arriving gliders, Major-General Richard Nelson Gale later wrote:"It is impossible <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>with</b> what relief we watched this reinforcement arrive." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{way that}} the series is {{affected}} by the events of Captain America: The Winter Soldier has been called [...] "miraculous", with Terri Schwartz at Zap2it writing [...] "the fact that the movie so influenced the show is game-changing in terms of how the mediums of film and television can be interwoven", while Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times stated that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. [...] "faces a future of perpetual re-invention, and that puts it in the exhilarating first car of television's roller-coaster ride toward possible world domination." [...] The fact that the series also depicts the rebuilding of S.H.I.E.L.D. in the MCU has also been highlighted, with Merrill Barr, reviewing [...] "Beginning of the End" [...] for Forbes, saying [...] "what Marvel's daring <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>with</b> this season finale is 'everything we do matters, and you need to pay attention to all of it.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Charles Darwin read Sir John's 1809 pamphlet, and was {{impressed}} with a passage that elaborated on how [...] "the weak and the unhealthy do not live to propagate their infirmities". These writings, along with Darwin's correspondence via their mutual friend William Yarrell, aided Darwin in the inception of Darwin's theory of natural selection. Darwin's seminal work On the Origin of Species, first published in 1859, cited Sir John's experiments in pigeon breeding, and recalled [...] "That most skilful breeder, Sir John Sebright, used <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>with</b> respect to pigeons, that 'he would produce any given feather in three years, {{but it would take}} him six years to obtain head and beak.'" [...] Darwin also cited Sir John extensively regarding the Sebright bantam, as well as pigeon and dog breeding, in his 1868 work Variation of Plants and Animals Under Domestication, his 1871 The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, and his book on Natural Selection (which was not published in his lifetime).|$|E
500|$|Individual Beatles later commented {{about their}} {{memories}} of Hamburg, with Lennon reflecting, [...] "We'd outlived the Hamburg stage {{and wanted to}} pack that up. We hated going back to Hamburg those last two times. We'd had that scene. Brian [...] made us go back to fulfill the contract...". Harrison had positive memories of the period: [...] "I'd have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>with</b> hindsight that Hamburg bordered on the best of Beatles times. We didn't have any luxury, we didn't have any bathrooms or any clothes, we were pretty grubby, we couldn't afford anything, {{but on the other}} hand we weren't yet famous, so we didn't have to contend with the bullshit that comes with fame." [...] McCartney was philosophical: [...] "Hamburg was certainly a great childhood memory. But I think all things are enhanced by time. It was very exciting, though I think it felt better to me a little later in our career, once we'd started to get a bit of success with the records." ...|$|E

[...] Megan Vick of Billboard was positive on the video, saying that, [...] "We can't be entirely sure what Robyn was trying <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>with</b> this treatment, {{but we do know}} that this video is hot – and intriguing." [...] Robbie Daw of music website Idolator compared it to a scene from The X-Files. He concluded by saying that [...] "This is hardcore, indeed." [...] Amber Katz of MTV Buzzworthy said that Robyn looks [...] "cherubic and futuristic , as if she belongs on the set of “Caprica”." [...] Katz compared Robyn's outfit to Rebecca Horn's [...] "Overflowing Blood Machine". DJ Ron Slomowicz of About.com called the video [...] "creepy and confusing" [...] and said, [...] "Overall, it is a scintillating if not entirely clear video." ...|$|E
