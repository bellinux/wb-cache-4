50|$|Coverstitch {{is formed}} {{by two or}} more needles {{and one or two}} loopers. Like {{lockstitch}} and chainstitch, coverstitch can be formed anywhere on the material being sewn. One looper manipulates a thread below the material being sewn, forming a bottom cover stitch against the needle threads. An additional looper above the material can form a top cover stitch simultaneously. The needle threads form parallel rows, while the looper threads cross back and forth all the needle rows. Coverstitch is so-called because the grid of crossing needle and looper <b>threads</b> <b>covers</b> raw seam edges, much as the overlock stitch does. It is widely used in garment construction, particularly for attaching trims and flat seaming where the raw edges can be finished in the same operation as forming the seam.|$|R

40|$|To {{analyze the}} {{constituents}} of retroviruses, the Moloney {{murine leukemia virus}} was disrupted and observed by dark-field electron microscopy. Virus disruption was achieved by several methods: osmotic shock, freezing-thawing cycles, and exposure to urea up to 4 M, to NaCl up to 1 M, and to Triton X- 100. Several components associated with broken Moloney murine leukemia virus were repeatedly found in preparations. These components {{have been described as}} rings, thick filaments, chain-like filaments, <b>threads</b> <b>covered</b> with proteins, <b>threads</b> with buckles, and naked threads. A quantitative analysis of the occurrence of these components has been carried out. Among them, the thick filaments composed of a compact helical arrangement of small beads 5 nm in diameter were considered to represent the nucleocapsid. The protease-sensitive buckles found on some threads could be a compact form of the viral RNA associated to the nucleocapsid protein NCp 10. The RNase-sensitive naked threads are interpreted as the deproteinized viral RNA itself. The ubiquitous chain-like filaments possess a periodic structure identical to that of polymerized type VI collagen. It is proposed that this adhesive protein is associated with the viral envelope taken from the cell membrane during the budding process of retroviruses...|$|R

40|$|Spiders' webs and gossamer threads {{are often}} paraded as {{paradigms}} for lightweight structures and outstanding polymers. Probably {{the most intriguing}} of all spider silks is the araneid capture <b>thread,</b> <b>covered</b> with tiny glycoprotein glue droplets. Even if compressed, this thread remains surprisingly taut, a property shared with pure liquid films, allowing both thread and web {{to be in a}} constant state of tension. Vollrath and Edmonds proposed that the glue droplets would act as small windlasses and be responsible for the tension, but other explanations have also been suggested, involving for example the macromolecular properties of the flagelliform silk core filaments. Here we show that the nanolitre glue droplets of the capture thread indeed induce buckling and coiling of the core filaments: microscopic in-vivo observations reveal that the slack fibre is spooled into and within the droplets. We model windlass activation as a structural phase transition, and show that fibre spooling essentially results from the interplay between elasticity and capillarity. This is demonstrated by reproducing artificially the mechanism on a synthetic polyurethane thread/silicone oil droplet system. Fibre size is the key in natural and artificial setups which both require micrometer-sized fibres to function. The spools and coils inside the drops are further shown to directly affect the mechanical response of the thread, evidencing the central role played by geometry in spider silk mechanics. Beside shedding light on araneid capture thread functionality, we argue that the properties of this biological system provide novel insights for bioinspired synthetic actuators.

40|$|Abstract Background On {{completion}} of the surgical procedure {{the hole in the}} ascending aorta has to be closed after withdrawal of the aortic root cannula. The aorta is usually pinched by a double transversal stitch or it is crumpled by a purse string suture. Nevertheless, hemostasis is difficult to obtain because closure is done under recovered pressure. Additional stitches buttressed with teflon-felt pledgets are often required. Unfortunately, sensitivity to bacterial implantation and the proximity to the sternotomy line could make the foreign material of the pledgets responsible for chronic infections and fistulas. Methods Two simple square stitches orthogonal to each other could be a very useful suture combining simplicity with effectiveness. To do this, two 4 - 0 polypropylene half-threads are put obliquely through the full thickness of the aortic wall, to and fro with inverse obliquities. Each of them draws a cross inside the aortic wall and two sides of a square outside. As a result a little square is drawn by the threads around the hole. Results For years we have never needed to reinforce the closure by supplemental stitches with hundreds of patients. Conclusion This type of closure has some advantages. In contrast to common stitches the aortic wall is not bent, crumpled or deformed, bites pass all aortic layers and the crossing of the <b>threads</b> <b>covers</b> the hole from inside rather than outside. Moreover, each thread can be tied with half of the tension required by other sutures because the two stitches act together but in the opposite direction. Finally, the technique is speedy and it requires only two half-threads. Most importantly, {{there is no need for}} teflon-felt pledgets. As a result, we have no longer seen any type of chronic infection or fistula. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about the {{mechanisms}} of bacterial interaction with implant materials in the oral cavity. Other surface characteristics, in addition to surface roughness, seem to be extremely important in relation to plaque formation. Different adhesion affinities of bacteria were reported for different materials. Anatase is a nanoparticle that can be applied to titanium surfaces as a coating. The anatase coating gives special characteristics to the implant surface, including some genetic effects on osteoblasts. In this study, the antibacterial effect of anatase is investigated. The aim {{of this study is to}} characterize the percentages of surfaces covered by bacteria on commercially pure (cp) titanium and anatase-coated healing screws. Methods: Ten patients participated in this study. The protocol of the study was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Chieti-Pescara. A total of 20 healing screws (10 test and 10 control screws) were used in the study. The control screws were made of cp titanium, whereas the test screws were coated with anatase. Cleaning procedures and agents for chemical plaque control were not applied to the healing screws for the complete duration of the test period. After 7 days, all healing screws were removed, substituted, and processed under scanning electron microscopy for evaluation of the portions of the surfaces covered by bacteria. Results: The supracrestal screw surfaces covered by bacteria on test specimens were not significantly lower than those of control screws (P = 0. 174). The subcrestal screw surfaces and <b>threads</b> <b>covered</b> by bacteria on test specimens were significantly lower than those of control screws, and P values were 0. 001 and 0. 000, respectively. Conclusion: Results show that anatase could be a suitable material for coating implant abutments, with a low colonization potential. J Periodontol 2010; 81 : 1466 - 1471...|$|R

Most Type I diabetics take insulin injections after each meal in order to remain euglycemic.

In this study, reinforced alginate fibers were fabricated as an alternative to alginate capsules for islet transplantation. Surgical <b>thread</b> was <b>covered</b> in alginate-cell solution by the microfluidic nozzle system to give a stronger structure to be used for implanting the cells. The thickness of the cell-encapsulated alginate layer produced by microfluidic nozzle processing system was controlled by varying the flow rate of alginate being pumped through the nozzle as well as by varying the speed by which the thread was extracted from the nozzle. The study showed that higher flow rates of alginate and lower thread speeds result in thicker alginate layers for encapsulating more cells within the fiber. The cells remained viable over a month, suggesting plausibility of cell-encapsulated microfibers as a long term solution to diabetes treatment. by Sydney C. Carter. Thesis: S.
