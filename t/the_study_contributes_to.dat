40|$|In this study, {{we propose}} a Bilateral Double Motive {{framework}} of stakeholder cooperation in complex projects. The framework analyses and explains dyadic promoter-stakeholder relationships at a micro level by acknowledging both transactional and relational motives. We demonstrate the framework’s usefulness by illustrating its explanatory power in two instances {{of cooperation and}} two of non-cooperation within two health information technology projects. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> project management theory through its combined focus on transactional and relational motives. Further, <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> practice by providing a tool for planning and evaluating cooperation in health Information Technology projects and similar complex multi-stakeholder environments...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{understand}} the process by which consumers ’ perception of online VR environments impact their purchase decision. Combining factor and process models, we propose a transaction framework suggestive of consumer decision-making in VR e-commerce environments. The framework is informed by theory to be validated by an experimental design to understand the antecedents and contingencies that shape decision-making. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> research by considering a pertinent, yet parsimonious set of factors and processes that culminate in consumer decision making in rich, VR driven environments. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> practitioners by investigating how consumers perceive virtual environments that organizations are spending enormous amounts to develop and maintain, and whether consumer perceptions do impact the positive purchase decision...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{important}} {{responsibility of}} promoters of enterprise information systems (EIS) is {{to manage the}} relations with the system's stakeholders. This is a complex task because of the increasing scope and impact of modern information technologies. In this study we propose and test a model of stakeholder cooperation in a healthcare-EIS context. The model explains effective promoter-stakeholder cooperation by acknowledging transactional as well as relational motives. In the empirical part, this Bilateral, Double Motive (BDM) model is validated by the analysis of three different cases of promoter-stakeholder cooperation. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> stakeholder theory in EIS contexts by its combined focus on transactional as well as relational motives. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> practice by providing a systematic way to consider cooperation in EIS projects, especially in healthcare environments...|$|E

40|$|The study {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between the individual member and the voluntary, democratically structured organisation in terms of its impact on the organisation's ability to engage in effective strategic change in response to environmental challenges. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> the understanding of the operation of these organisations {{within the context of the}} literature on organisational dynamics, behaviour and development. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> the development of a theoretical explanation of the management of strategic change and its relationship to membership participation within such organisations. There is a particular focus on organisational learning as a process of continuous strategic change. This is because of the specific voluntary characteristics of membership participation within this organisational sector. In addition to testing a number of hypotheses, the study proposes and tests an Input Output Analytical Model. It is envisaged that the model can be used as a diagnostic instrument to aid the development of membership participation, organisational learning and strategic change capabilities of voluntary, democratically structured organisations.
