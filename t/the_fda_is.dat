In August 2016 the DEA reaffirmed its position and refused to remove Schedule I classification. However, the DEA announced that it will end restrictions on the supply of marijuana to researchers and drug companies that had previously only been available from the government's own facility at the University of Mississippi.|$|E
25|$|The broad {{pet food}} recalls {{starting}} in March 2007 came {{in response to}} reports of renal failure in pets consuming mostly wet pet foods made with wheat gluten from a single Chinese company beginning in February 2007. Overall, several major companies recalled more than 100 brands of pet foods {{with most of the}} recalled product coming from Menu Foods. The most likely cause according to <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>is</b> the presence of melamine in the wheat gluten of the affected foods. Melamine is known to falsely inflate the protein content rating of substances in laboratory tests. The economic impact on the pet food market has been extensive, with Menu Foods alone losing roughly $30 million from the recall. Some companies were not affected and utilized the situation to generate sales for alternative pet foods.|$|E

[...] The statement, extracted from a 1969 New York Times interview, {{was made in the}} context of Ley's resignation from his post as a result of numerous policy disputes. [...] Trudeau's lawyer, David J.

2500|$|After his resignation, {{from his}} post as Commissioner of the Food and Drugs Administration in December 1969, Dr. Herbert L. Ley, Jr. [...] In an {{interview}} to the New York Times, warned {{the public about the}} FDA’s inability to safeguard consumers. People were being misled, he believed “The thing [...] that bugs me is that the people think <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>is</b> protecting them - it isn’t. What <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>is</b> doing and what the public thinks it’s doing are as different as night and day,” he said. The agency, in his opinion, did not have the motivation to protect consumers, faced budget shortfalls, and lacked support from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Dr. Ley was critical of Congress, the Administration and the drug industry, he stated that he had [...] "constant, tremendous, sometimes unmerciful pressure" [...] from the drug industry and that the drug company lobbyists, combined with the politicians who worked on behalf of their patrons, could bring “tremendous pressure” to bear on him and his staff, to try preventing FDA restrictions on their drugs. The interview concluded with Ley stating that the entire issue was about money, “pure and simple”. On December 15, 1999, interviewed for the oral history program of the FDA History Office, Dr. Ley shared that from the first controversy in his tenure as FDA Commissioner he had a [...] "gut feeling" [...] that his life expectancy at the FDA was probably limited. He said he had done everything by the book, both in the FDA and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and he thinks that what the Administration was really wishing, was that he would stonewall the whole Academy report, because it was goring too many pharmaceutical companies.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, the FDA {{concluded}} {{an assessment}} of scientific research {{on the effects of}} BPA and stated in the March 2012 Consumer Update that [...] "the scientific evidence at this time does not suggest that the very low levels of human exposure to BPA through the diet are unsafe" [...] although recognizing [...] "potential uncertainties in the overall interpretation of these studies including route of exposure used in the studies and the relevance of animal models to human health. <b>The</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>is</b> continuing to pursue additional research to resolve these uncertainties." [...] Yet on 17 July 2012, the FDA banned BPA from baby bottles and sippy cups. A FDA spokesman said the agency's action was not based on safety concerns and that [...] "the agency continues to support the safety of BPA for use in products that hold food." [...] Since manufacturers had already stopped using the chemical in baby bottles and sippy cups, the decision was a response to a request by the American Chemistry Council, the chemical industry's main trade association, who believed that a ban would boost consumer confidence. The ban was criticized as [...] "purely cosmetic" [...] by the Environmental Working Group, which stated that [...] "If the agency truly wants to prevent people from being exposed to this toxic chemical associated with a variety of serious and chronic conditions it should ban its use in cans of infant formula, food and beverages." [...] The Natural Resources Defense Council called the move inadequate saying, the FDA needs to ban BPA from all food packaging.|$|E
