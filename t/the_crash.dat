5|$|At {{the time}} of <b>the</b> <b>crash,</b> Crossair was a {{majority}} owned subsidiary of SAirGroup. <b>The</b> <b>crash</b> of Crossair Flight LX498 {{was the first time}} in Crossair's 25-year history that the regional airline had lost an aircraft, and was the deadliest accident to hit the SAirGroup since <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> of Swissair Flight 111, an MD-11 flying from New York to Geneva that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off Nova Scotia on 2 September 1998, killing all 229 aboard.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{emergency}} personnel responded to <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> site and helped save victims. Many {{of those who}} survived were severely injured and required months or years to physically recover. NTSB investigators looked at various factors that contributed to <b>the</b> <b>crash.</b> The failures of the flight crew were cited as the probable cause of <b>the</b> <b>crash,</b> but the weather, air traffic controller performances, and FAA traffic management were also cited as contributing to the {{events that led to}} the accident. This conclusion was controversial, with disagreement between investigators, passengers, and Avianca as to who was ultimately responsible. Eventually, the U.S. government joined with Avianca and settled to pay for the damages to the victims and their families. <b>The</b> <b>crash</b> was also portrayed in a variety of media.|$|E

They presented aviation journalist Tim van Beveren, whom they had commissioned to publish a new report, which asserted that Lubitz could have fallen unconscious, that the cockpit door lock had malfunctioned on previous flights, and that potentially dangerous turbulence had been reported in the area on the day of <b>the</b> <b>crash.</b> The timing of the press conference by Lubitz's father, on the anniversary of <b>the</b> <b>crash,</b> was criticized by families of the victims, who were holding their own remembrances on that day.|$|E

5|$|Toivonen's crash {{remains a}} mystery because it had no close witnesses. Although it was caught on tape by a spectator further down the stage, {{it proved to be}} {{impossible}} to determine the cause of <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> from the footage. No race marshalls were close to the scene to notice the black smoke and no-one at the race finish knew about <b>the</b> <b>crash.</b> Toivonen's team only started to fear something might have happened after he failed to arrive from the stage on schedule. The next rally crew through the stage then mentioned they had seen some black smoke. By the time the emergency vehicles arrived on <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> scene, they could only put down the flames, which had been fanned by breezes. Lancia engineers and technicians could not determine the cause of <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> because the remains of the car were so charred.|$|E

5|$|All of the aircrew {{involved}} in <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> had only limited flying {{time in the}} months before <b>the</b> <b>crash.</b> The B-52's aircrew were apparently unaware that the aircraft had stalled until shortly before impact, indicated by a failure to apply standard recovery techniques to the aircraft once it entered the stall. The investigation reported that, even if the proper stall recovery techniques had been applied, the aircraft was likely too low to recover before hitting the ground.|$|E
