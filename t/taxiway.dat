5|$|On 23 May, a $17 million {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} two companies, to complete {{the first phase of}} construction. This included the north−south runway, a parallel <b>taxiway</b> (<b>Taxiway</b> J), a parking apron, the Arch Hangar, a base operations building, a control tower, a power plant, a 250-person barracks (which would later become Building 6000), a water supply system, and a railroad spur to the base (now part of the Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway).|$|E
5|$|On December 15, 2015, Southwest Airlines Flight 31, a Boeing 737-300, from Houston, Texas, {{exited the}} <b>taxiway</b> and rolled {{into a ditch}} shortly after {{arriving}} into Nashville as the airplane was entering the terminal ramp. All 138 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane and bussed into the airport.|$|E
5|$|At 03:58, C-130E, #72-1297, {{flown by}} a crew from the 776th Tactical Airlift Squadron, was {{destroyed}} by a 122mm rocket while taxiing to pick up refugees after offloading a BLU-82 at Tan Son Nhut Air Base. The crew evacuated the burning aircraft on the <b>taxiway</b> and departed the airfield on another C-130 that had previously landed. This was the last USAF fixed-wing aircraft to leave Tan Son Nhut. Between 04:30 and 08:00 up to 40 artillery rounds and rockets hit around the DAO Compound.|$|E

3000|$|... <b>taxiways,</b> taxiwayPermission, taxiwaysAssigned and taxiing. The taxiwayPermission is a {{sequence}} type representing aircrafts having permission for taxiing. The taxiwaysAssigned is a mapping to record aircrafts which are assigned <b>taxiways.</b> The taxiing mapping is to record information about aircrafts which {{are on the}} <b>taxiways.</b>|$|R
50|$|Along <b>taxiways,</b> {{blue lights}} {{indicate}} the <b>taxiway's</b> edge, and some airports have embedded green lights that indicate the centerline.|$|R
5|$|On 22 December 2013, British Airways Flight 34, a Boeing 747–436 G-BNLL, hit a {{building}} at O. R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg after missing a turning on a <b>taxiway.</b> The starboard wing was severely damaged {{but there were}} no injuries amongst the crew or 189 passengers, however four members of ground staff were injured when the wing smashed into the building. The aircraft was officially withdrawn from service in February 2014.|$|E
5|$|Runway 09R/27L, the {{original}} and primary runway, is {{long enough to be}} able to receive the Airbus A380, the world's largest passenger aircraft. Originally a <b>taxiway,</b> runway 09L/27R was inaugurated in February 2012. Its shorter length and width allow it to handle smaller aircraft such as the Airbus A340 and Boeing 747. It is mainly used when runway 09R/27L is undergoing maintenance, and as air traffic to the airport rises it will be used more often. North of these runways are the three parking aprons: the cargo, passenger terminal and MRO aprons. The passenger terminal apron contains parking stands on both the north and south sides of the terminal.|$|E
5|$|The airport {{had very}} poor {{operating}} conditions. Whenever an aircraft was to land, the cranes at the shipyard {{had to be}} moved to allow sufficient clearance. Conversely, the airport {{could not be used}} when ships were launched. The industrial buildings were located just next to the <b>taxiway.</b> The control tower was located such that it did not have visual sight of the entire runway. The surrounding terrain, consisting of deep fjords, mountains and a town, made it impossible to install an instrument landing system. This again meant that the airport could only be served during daylight. The airport never received a permanent operating license.|$|E
50|$|The new apron with {{an area of}} 148000 m2 {{can handle}} 18 {{aircraft}} simultaneously, including two wide body, 11 medium and five small aircraft. There are two 3000 x 30 m parallel <b>taxiways,</b> including five exit <b>taxiways</b> (30 m wide) and four connecting <b>taxiways</b> (also 30 m).|$|R
5000|$|Existing {{aircraft}} <b>taxiways</b> {{are to be}} resurfaced, widened or re-routed and {{new aircraft}} <b>taxiways</b> and aprons are be constructed. There are no proposals to alter the existing runways.|$|R
50|$|JFK {{has over}} 25 mi of <b>taxiways</b> to move {{aircraft}} {{in and around}} the airfield. The standard width of these <b>taxiways</b> is 75 ft, with 25 ft heavy-duty shoulders and 25 ft erosion control pavements on each side. The <b>taxiways</b> have centerline lights and are generally of asphalt concrete composition 15 to 18 in thick. An illuminated sign system provides directional information for taxiing aircraft.|$|R
5|$|Although Project Alberta had no attack orders, it {{proceeded}} {{with the plan}} to have the Little Boy ready by 1 August 1945 and the first Fat Man ready for use {{as soon as possible}} after that. In the meantime, a series of twelve combat missions were flown between 20 and 29 July against targets in Japan using high-explosive Pumpkin bombs. Project Alberta's Sheldon Dike and Milo Bolstead flew on some of these missions, as did the British observer Group Captain Leonard Cheshire. One serious incident occurred when a Pumpkin bomb was released in the bomb bay of the B-29 Strange Cargo while it was taxiing. The bomb fell through the closed bomb bay doors onto the <b>taxiway.</b> The plane came to a halt in a shower of sparks, but fire fighters doused the plane and the bomb in foam, and the bomb did not explode. The aircraft had to be jacked up to remove the bomb.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War, new U.S. Air Force bases were {{constructed}} {{along the northern}} border of the continental U.S.; their most direct route to the Soviet Union was through the Arctic Circle. These sites were high-importance strategic bases for hosting long-range missiles and aircraft. In 1947, the New England Division of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers chose a site in northeastern Maine, within both the Limestone Township and Caswell Plantation. The remote site consisted mostly of dense forest, shallow marshes, and wild blueberry bogs, on a slight plateau over the town, which helped keep it above the fog most of the time. Only {{a small part of}} the base was suitable for farming, so there was little impact on Aroostook County's agricultural community. Additionally, Loring was not far from sources of materials for runway, <b>taxiway,</b> and parking apron construction. The most important benefit of the site was that it was a few hundred miles closer than any other base to potential targets in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The player {{may choose}} to begin flight on a runway or <b>taxiway,</b> or in the air. Aircraft are {{controlled}} via keyboard, joystick, head-mounted display or specialized input devices such as pedals. During flight, several third- and first-person camera angles may be selected. For example, the third-person Flyby View places the camera {{in front of the}} plane as it flies past, while the first-person Three-Way View displays more information about the plane's position and speed than other angles. Certain camera angles, including the Three-Way View and 3-D Cockpit view, provide the player with simulated flight instruments such as an altimeter, airspeed indicator, accelerometer, variometer and tachometer. The game is designed to allow players to perform aerobatic maneuvers such as the Immelmann turn, tailslide, Lomcevak and Cuban Eight. Performances may be recorded and played back, with controls that allow the player to pause, rewind and fast forward. At any time, the player may stop a recording and resume flight from that point.|$|E
50|$|The airport has 70 {{boarding}} bridges {{along with}} 218 parking positions. Four runways are in operation: one 4000 m runway with 4E rating (capable of accommodating aircraft up to Boeing 747-400) and six <b>taxiways,</b> two 3800 m runways with 4F rating (capable of accommodating aircraft up to Airbus A380, Boeing 747-8, and Antonov An-225) and four <b>taxiways</b> each, and one 3400 m runway with 4F rating and six <b>taxiways.</b>|$|R

5|$|On 1 September 1993, NSB {{launched}} the Trøndelag Commuter Rail, {{of which the}} main service ran from Steinkjer to Trondheim. The initial plans called to the continued use of the Class 92 rolling stock, but saw change in schedules and the upgrading platforms for NOK15 million. At the same time, the stations of Alstad, Langstein and Fleskhus were closed. The service from Trondheim to Steinkjer had ten daily round trips. After six months operation, the service had experienced a 40 percent growth in patronage. This was further increased {{with the opening of}} Trondheim Airport Station on 15 November 1994, which cost NOK24 million. The upgrades to the airport also included a new <b>taxiway,</b> which resulted in second Værnes Tunnel being built. A station was also established to serve Levanger Hospital on 20 December 1995. On 10 November 1994, the line received automatic train control. NSB was split up on 1 December 1996 and the ownership of the tracks and infrastructure was inherited by the Norwegian National Rail Administration, while the operation of trains was taken over by the new NSB. From 1994, Di6 and Di8 locomotives were introduced, but the Di6 proved unreliable and returned to the manufacturer.|$|E
25|$|During 2011 the {{airfield}} underwent {{a number of}} changes. Runway 07/25 was closed as an active runway and was re-opened as <b>Taxiway</b> C, running {{the full length of}} the old runway. The previous <b>Taxiway</b> C was closed and its northern part, between Runway 10/28 and the old Runway 07/25, was opened as an extension of <b>Taxiway</b> E. Another notable change has been the relocation of the airport's Fire Services which have been moved from north of the fuel farm to a more central position, between the terminal and some of the flying clubs, on the <b>Taxiway</b> B ramp.|$|E

25|$|The airport commemorated its 60th {{anniversary in}} 2004, with {{an event that}} opened the new <b>Taxiway</b> Sierra, a new <b>taxiway</b> {{supporting}} larger aircraft such as the Boeing 747, Airbus A340, and potentially the Airbus A380 to operate at the airport.|$|E
25|$|On July 7, 2017, Air Canada Flight 759, an A320-200 was {{instructed}} by {{air traffic control}} to go around after overflying <b>Taxiway</b> C for 0.25 miles (400 m) while on visual approach for 28R. The A320 overflew the first two aircraft lined up on <b>Taxiway</b> C by roughly 100 feet (30 m). The pilots landed the aircraft afterwards without incident. A total of three wide-body aircraft and one narrow-body aircraft were lined up awaiting takeoff on <b>Taxiway</b> C. The NTSB is investigating.|$|E

25|$|This {{incident}} occurred on 12 April 1988. It involved a BAC One-Eleven 500 (registration: G-AYWB). The aircraft, {{which had been}} cleared to land on Gatwick's runway 08L (the airport's standby runway), inadvertently landed on the parallel <b>taxiway.</b> An air traffic controller in Gatwick's control tower, who spotted the BIA One-Eleven coming in {{to land on the}} <b>taxiway</b> parallel to the emergency runway, ordered a British Airways Boeing 737 that had just entered the same <b>taxiway</b> to vacate it immediately. This resulted in the 737 taxiing right into the grass and the One-Eleven stopping 100-200m {{to the west of the}} 737's position.|$|E
25|$|Until the 1980s {{the airport}} had four runways; in the 1950s runway 9 was 5000ft, runways 6 (now <b>taxiway</b> A-3) and 12 (now <b>taxiway</b> A-4) were 4000ft and the 3059-ft runway 18 {{connected}} the west ends of runways 6 and 12. In 1963-65 runway 9 {{was extended to}} 6000ft. In 1967 SBN got its first scheduled jets, which were United Caravelles on a Chicago O'Hare-South Bend-Fort Wayne-Newark and back rotation.|$|E
25|$|The {{completed}} works involved above ground-level (AGL) earthworks and pavement upgrades, {{extension of}} the runway length from 2454 metres to 3780 metres, widening of shoulders from 46 metres to 60 metres, extension of parallel <b>taxiway</b> to a full parallel <b>taxiway</b> with interconnection/rapid exit taxiways including widening of <b>taxiway</b> fillets and shoulders to 30 metres. The air-side apron works included {{the construction of a}} cargo apron, high-intensity lightings and markings. Visual and non-visual aids will be upgraded and/or relocated consistent with the upgrading plan to serve the extended runway. With nine gates, the airport can handle six narrow body aircraft (such as Boeing 737 and Airbus A320), three widebody aircraft and four turboprop aircraft. Of note, gate number 9 was specifically constructed for Airbus A380-800 operations.|$|E
5000|$|Today, the airport's World War II history remains {{with the}} alert pads {{built by the}} Germans {{at each end of}} the main runway.
