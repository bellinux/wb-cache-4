6000|$|I am sure I don't {{know what}} they will think of me when I get back. It seems as if; over here, I had learned {{to come out with}} everything. I suppose they will think I am not sincere; but isn't it more sincere to come out with things than to conceal them? I have become very good friends with every one in the house--that is (you see, I am sincere), with almost every one. It is the most {{interesting}} circle I ever was in. There's a girl here, an American, that I don't like so much as the rest; but that is only because she won't let me. I should like to like her, ever so much, because she is most lovely and most attractive; but she doesn't seem to want to know me or to like me. She comes from New York, and she is remarkably pretty, with beautiful eyes and the most delicate features; she is also remarkably elegant--in this respect would bear comparison with any one I have seen over here. But it seems as if she didn't want to recognise me or associate with me; as if she wanted to make a difference between us. It is like people they call [...] "haughty" [...] in books. I have never seen any one like that before--any one that wanted to make a difference; and at first I was right down interested, she seemed to me so like a proud young lady in a novel. I kept saying to myself all day, [...] "haughty, haughty," [...] and I wished she would keep on so. But she did keep on; she kept on too long; and then I began to feel hurt. I couldn't think what I have done, and I can't think yet. It's as if she had got some idea about me, or had heard some one say something. If some girls should behave like that I shouldn't make any account of it; but <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> refined, and looks as if she might be so interesting if I once got to know her, that I think about it a good deal. I am bound to find out what her reason is--for of course she has got some reason; I am right down curious to know.|$|E

[...] Citing such things as the ape {{vomiting}} and the ape dancing to the film score, Bogue states that [...] "as the genre magazine Castle of Frankenstein used to say in its movie reviews, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> bad it has to be seen to be disbelieved." ...|$|E

She {{had learned in}} a hard school to be {{prepared}} for sudden blows from the hand of fate, but <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> entirely unforeseen that it found her unprepared, and she was crushed by it.

5000|$|Owen Gleiberman of Variety wrote: [...] "The {{problem at}} its heart is that {{the reality of what}} the movie is—a Tom Cruise vehicle—is at war with the material. The actor, at 54, is still playing that old Cruise trope, the selfish cocky semi-scoundrel who has to grow up. ... The trouble is that Cruise, at least in a high-powered potboiler like <b>this</b> <b>one,</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> devoted to {{maintaining}} his image as a clear and wholesome hero that his flirtation with the dark side is almost entirely theoretical." [...] Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film one star out of four, saying: [...] "How meh is The Mummy? Let me count the ways. For all the huffing and puffing and digital desperation from overworked computers, this reboot lands onscreen with a resounding thud." ...|$|E
5000|$|Modern {{criticism}} {{has been more}} appreciative. As of 2015, Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 68% of 31 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.3/10. [...] Bloody Disgusting rated it four-and-a-half out of five stars and wrote, [...] "This film works on so many levels. Normally re-makes are horrible, and diverge so much from the original film. <b>This</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> close to the original it's scary." [...] Reviewing the Twilight Time Blu-ray, Adam Tyner of DVD Talk rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote, [...] "We'll never {{get a chance to}} see the remake that Tom Savini set out to direct. Still, despite the many missteps of this severely compromised version, Night of the Living Dead manages to distinguish itself as one of the more effective horror remakes out there." [...] Reviewing the same disc at DVD Verdict, Patrick Naugle rated it 83 out of 100 and called it [...] "one of the superior zombies movies available". [...] In a retrospective at PopMatters, academic Cynthia Freeland compared the racial politics of the original film and the gender politics of the remake. Freeland concludes that the original film's depiction of Barbara makes for better cinema, and the more feminist-friendly update of Barbara is too derivative of standard [...] "final girl" [...] tropes.|$|E
60|$|Louis was {{by nature}} a kind-hearted man. His {{feelings}} were touched, and his pride also was flattered by the abasement of this beautiful and haughty woman. His other favourites had been amiable to all, but <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> proud, so unyielding, until {{she felt his}} master-hand. His face softened somewhat in its expression as he glanced at her, but he shook his head, and his voice was as firm as ever as he answered.|$|R

Burnett made his first major league appearance since August 21, 2004 on May 6, 2008 against the San Francisco Giants. He allowed 2 runs in 2/3 of an inning. Said Burnett of his return: [...] "Honestly, {{it might have been}} more nerve-racking than my debut because my debut came <b>so</b> easy.

60|$|It {{was in a}} house, {{entered through}} such a {{labyrinth}} as this, that Rosamond {{is said to have}} lived, {{on the grounds of the}} palace of Woodstock, while Queen Eleanora, as the avowed wife and queen of King Henry, occupied the palace itself. Of course, the fact that such a lady was hidden on the grounds was kept a profound secret from the queen. If this story is true, there were probably other labyrinths on the grounds, and <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> surrounded with trees and hedges, which connected it by insensible gradations with the groves and thickets of the park, that there was nothing to attract attention to it particularly, and thus a lady might have remained concealed in it for some time without awakening suspicion.|$|R
40|$|The United States and {{the world}} saw a major {{economic}} decline {{at the end of}} 2007. A recession is defined as two or more consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. <b>This</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> severe that it was given a name [...] The Great Recession [...] and called the worst economic crisis since The Great Depression. In the United States more than 7. 5 million jobs were lost, doubling the unemployment rate (Grusky, D. B. et al, 2011). There have been several investigations into the causes of the economic recession. The general conclusion is that there were complex and interlinked factors behind the emergence of the crisis, namely loose monetary policies, global imbalances, misperception of risk and lax financial regulation (Verick, S., 2 ̆ 6 I. Islam, 2010) ...|$|R

It was the first {{encounter}} with the Legion and it tried to turn Big Guy and Rusty over to the Legion's side but they refused. Powered by nucleoprotons and destroyed by Rusty when tricked into taking his overloading powerpack. Remains scrapped by the Legion at #6's orders. The second was a several stories tall version. <b>This</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> powerful it could take the best Big Guy and Rusty could hit it with and come out without a scratch. Due to Big Guy and Rusty getting its left hand, it was missing a hand. Inside the hand was a 500 megawatt Vortex Cannon. Was sent out to get New Tronic City's Micro Fusion Generator to power a new assembly line for Legion robots. Was destroyed by Joe who fired the Argo's own Vortex Cannon into it once Rusty retrieved the firing mechanism in the left wrist.|$|R
5000|$|Love Story is {{an album}} by American pop singer Johnny Mathis that was {{released}} in February 1971 by Columbia Records and included a recent Oscar nominee ("What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?"), a flashback to 1967 ("Traces"), a new song by Bacharach & David ("Ten Times Forever More"), a lesser-known one by Goffin & King ("I Was There"), and two songs that originated in film scores from 1970 and had lyrics added later: the album closer, [...] "Loss of Love", from Sunflower and the album opener from Love Story, which was subtitled [...] "Where Do I Begin". The norm for Mathis projects from this era was to cover recent hits, and the title track of <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> recent that the version by Andy Williams began a 13-week run to number nine on Billboard magazine's Hot 100 chart in February 1971, coinciding {{with the release of}} this LP.|$|R

60|$|The {{evening and}} night {{through the whole}} town were spent in devotions both public and private; the churches for <b>this</b> <b>one</b> day <b>were</b> <b>so</b> crowded by the nobility and gentry, that {{thousands}} of common people were seen praying in the public streets.

[...] "After all, both [...] "Magic Mountain" [...] and [...] "Versatile Toppings" [...] are straightforward episodes that easily could have fit in with season one apart from that, and the former <b>is</b> fantastic, while <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> solid. <b>So</b> I'm glad those constraints have been loosened, although given this season's forays into insanity, I may live to regret that." ...|$|R
60|$|Wyatt {{continued}} to advance. He was still upon {{the south side}} of the river. There <b>was</b> but <b>one</b> bridge across the Thames, at London, in those days, though there are half a dozen now, and <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> strongly barricaded and guarded that Wyatt did not dare to attempt to cross it. He went up the river, therefore, to cross at a higher point; and this circuit, and several accidental circumstances which occurred, detained him so long that a considerable force had been got together to receive him when he was ready to enter the city. He pushed boldly on into the narrow streets, which received him like a trap or a snare. The city troops hemmed up his way after he had entered. They barricaded the streets, they shut the gates, and armed men poured in to take possession of all the avenues. Wyatt depended upon finding the people of London on his side. They turned, instead, against him. All hope of success in his enterprise, and all possibility of escape from his own awful danger, disappeared together. A herald came from the queen's officer calling upon him to surrender himself quietly, and save the effusion of blood. He surrendered in an agony of terror and despair.|$|R

5000|$|... "The Merchant's Tale" [...] (The Marchantes Tale) <b>is</b> <b>one</b> of Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. In it Chaucer subtly mocks antifeminist {{literature}} {{like that}} of Theophrastus ('Theofraste'). The tale also shows the influence of Boccaccio (Decameron: 7th day, 9th tale), Deschamps' , Roman de la Rose by Guillaume de Lorris (translated into English by Chaucer), Andreas Capellanus, Statius and Cato. The tale is found in Persia in the Bahar Danush, in which the husband climbs a date tree instead of a pear tree. It could have arrived in Europe through the One Thousand and One Nights, or perhaps the version in book VI of the Masnavi by Rumi.
