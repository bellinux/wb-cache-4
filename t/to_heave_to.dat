5|$|Amazon {{went on to}} join Nelson in {{the chase}} to the West Indies and back during the Trafalgar Campaign. During the voyage across the Atlantic, Nelson wanted to pass on {{specific}} instructions to his captains about how he wished to engage the French, but {{did not want to}} lose time by ordering his ships <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>to.</b> Instead he gave the plans to Parker, who was described by Pulteney Malcolm as the 'best frigate captain in the service', and Parker sped along the line in Amazon, delivering the instructions so efficiently that the fleet lost 'hardly a yard of ground'. Once more in European waters after the fleet's return, Amazon captured the Spanish privateer Principe de la Paz off Ushant on 17 September 1805. Principe was armed with twenty-four 9-pounder guns and four swivels. Her crew of 160 men, under the command of Captain François Beck, were principally French. She had been out five weeks and had captured the packet Prince of Wales from Lisbon, and the letter of marque Lady Nelson, which had been sailing from Virginia to Glasgow. A number of Lady Nelsons crew were aboard Principe, as was a considerable amount of specie.|$|E
25|$|On 9 January 1917, Seeadler {{came upon}} a single-funneled steamer, raised a signal {{requesting}} a time signal (not an uncommon thing for a sailing ship long out of contact with land to do), and raised the German ensign {{too late for the}} target ship to take any evasive action. Three shots were needed to persuade the 3,268 ton Gladys Royle, carrying coal from Cardiff to Buenos Aires, <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>to.</b> Her crew was taken off unharmed, and she was scuttled.|$|E
25|$|Overnight {{there was}} a strong {{northwest}} wind and heavy sea, drenching everyone in the boats. At first light on 24 October the boats could not see each other. Mr Vernon's boat hoisted its sail and set off before the wind, until at 1010 hrs his crew sighted the Third Officer's boat several miles to the southwest. They tried to steer towards it, but the heavy weather prevented them. At 1230 hrs Vernon abandoned the attempt and altered course to the southeast. At 1700 hrs he ordered the sail lowered and the boat <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>to</b> with her sea anchor. At 2300 hrs the rudder broke off at the top pintle, so two of Vernon's men used an oar as an improvised and unsatisfactory steering oar. On 25 October the weather was still wild so Mr Vernon's boat drifted before the wind with her sea anchor and sail.|$|E

60|$|It {{was four}} bells {{in the morning}} watch. We had just {{finished}} breakfast when the order came forward for the watch on deck <b>to</b> stand by <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> her <b>to</b> and all hands stand by the boats.|$|R
6000|$|... “She’s {{getting along}} fast, but Hartley thinks she’s {{carrying}} more sail than is prudent,” Aynsley remarked. “There’s a big {{strain on the}} weather rigging, and I imagine it would be safer <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> her <b>to</b> and shorten sail.” ...|$|R
25|$|At 1030 {{hours on}} the morning of 24 November Seneca hailed Tomoka in {{latitude}} 40° 21.6' North, longitude 73° 49.7' West and ordered her <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>to</b> and be prepared to be boarded and examined. A surfboat with an armed boarding party in charge of Lieutenant L. W. Perkins was sent to go on board and take charge of the vessel. At first Tomoka broke out the British flag and cruised about so that the boarding party would not overtake her. Seneca called her gun crews to quarters, cast loose the number one gun, and then ordered Tomoka to permit the boat to board. The master then complied. At 12:00 the boarding officer reported that he was all right and requested the Seneca to go ahead and he would follow with Tomoka. Seneca shaped a course for the Ambrose Channel lightship, but by 12:30 Tomoka had still not started to follow. Heading back for the rum-runner Seneca was met by her boarding party, which had been chased off Tomoka with a machinegun.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, Seeadler encountered another steamship, which {{refused to}} identify itself. The German ensign was raised and a shot fired across {{the bow of}} the Lundy Island, which was carrying sugar from Madagascar. The steamer still refused <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>to,</b> and Luckner fired four rounds directly at her. The steamer then hove to and lowered her boats, but her captain ignored an order to come to Seeadler. A German boarding party was sent over and discovered that the crew had abandoned ship when the first shots were fired, leaving the captain alone on board. Captain Bannister later told Luckner that he had previously been captured by a German raider and had given his parole, which he had broken; thus, he was not anxious to be a prisoner of war again. Luckner continued his voyage southwards, and by 21 January he was in mid-Atlantic between Brazil and West Africa when he found the 2,199 ton French three-masted barque Charles Gounod, which was loaded with corn. She was quickly dispatched, but her log book recorded information about other ships she had met and their intended route.|$|E
25|$|The trawler {{designated}} Khánh Hòa Province Trawler (map reference #2) {{was first}} sighted by Market Time aircraft on 29 February approximately 90 miles east northeast of Nha Trang with a southwesterly course. Surveillance was continued by Market Time vessels until {{she crossed the}} 12 mile limit 28 miles northeast of Nha Trang. Ignoring warning <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>to</b> for boarding, the trawler continued on towards the beach. A South Vietnamese Navy patrol boat opened fire on the trawler and it quickly changed course and returned fire. Assisted by a U.S. Air Force AC-47 gunship, swift boats PCF-42, PCF-43, PCF-46, PCF-47, PCF-48 and two SVN junks sortied to help the patrol craft chase the trawler to a cove where it ran aground in the Hon Heo Secret Zone At 0230, 1 March, five 81-millimeter mortar rounds from PCF-47 were direct hits and the trawler exploded with a massive explosion due to the munitions aboard. Fourteen dead North Vietnamese sailors were recovered the following morning. Rifles, machine guns and rocket launchers; along with considerable ammunition and explosives were recovered from the sunken trawler. The salvage operations extended over 12 days and included the recovery of a 14.5 millimeter antiaircraft gun and 68 cases of ammunition.|$|E

Perhaps {{it was the very}} gold of Parvaim. Eh, why not? It went <b>to</b> my heart <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> it on <b>to</b> the mud, but I saw well that if the evil thing remained, or if even the hope of finding it remained, the King would not sign the New Laws, and the land would perish.' ...|$|R
40|$|After {{highlighting}} Foucault’s ambivalent {{position with}} regards to psychoanalysis, this paper first shows that Foucault’s critical thought, insofar as it finds its condition of possibility in modern philosophy understood as a theoretical discourse on human finitude, must imperatively be complemented {{in the vicinity of}} psychoanalytical praxis-discourse: the ethical and political issue of the finished and desiring subjectivity can thus be examined anew. On the basis of the historicization of the Lacanian Law undertaken in La volonté de savoir, the paper therefore concludes that a philosophical anthropology which is able <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> up <b>to</b> today’s decisive issues for the social critique and the politics of emancipation should build upon the Foucaldo-Lacanian critique of “modern” philosophical anthropology, but should not fear to confront it with radical criticism in return...|$|R
500|$|The ship, which {{identified}} {{herself as}} Willmoto, did not satisfactorily identify {{herself to the}} American warships. After ordering [...] "Willmoto" [...] <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>to,</b> Omahas captain dispatched an armed boarding party. At 05:37 Lieutenant George K. Carmichael, along with the boarding party, began {{to make way for}} the vessel. Around this time, the merchant hoisted the signal flags [...] "Fox Mike", indicating that the ship was sinking and that they required assistance. Two distinct explosions could be heard within the ship when the boarding party began to climbing the ship's ladder. In an attempt to leave the sinking ship, several of the crew had lowered lifeboats, but Lt. Carmichael ordered them to return to the ship. At 05:58, Carmichael signaled to Omaha that the ship was indeed a German ship and that the crew had attempted to scuttle her. She was identified as Odenwald, a German blockade runner and that her holds were filled with [...] of rubber, along with 103 B. F. Goodrich truck tires and sundry other cargo that totaled [...] total.|$|E
500|$|A similar {{conclusion}} {{was the result}} of the capture of a steel hull trawler 15 July 1967 after three days of tracking by patrol aircraft and the radar picket, [...] After playing a cat-and-mouse game for three days with TF115 units the trawler headed for the mouth of the Sa Ky River on the Batangan Peninsula late on 14 July. The trawler was directed by Point Orient <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>to,</b> but the hail was answered with gunfire. The cutter returned fire along with Wilhoite and gunboat , destroyer , and PCF-79. At 02:00 on 15 July, the trawler was boxed in and ablaze, and ran aground [...] from shore. South Korean marines directed artillery fire from the shore and at 06:00 with the trawler apparently abandoned, a U.S. Navy demolitions expert from Walker boarded the trawler and defused 2,000 pounds of TNT charges that were designed to scuttle the craft. Found on board were several thousand rounds of rifle and machine gun ammunition, mortar and rocket rounds, anti-personnel mines, grenades, and several thousand pounds of C-4 plastic explosive and TNT. Weapons found included several hundred machine guns, AK-47 rifles, AK-56 rifles, and B-40 rocket launchers.|$|E
2500|$|By 6 January 1941, Detmers {{was ready}} to {{relocate}} to a point west of the Mediterranean {{because of a lack}} of targets, but that afternoon, Kormoran encountered the 3,729-ton Greek freighter Antonis. The raider ordered the freighter <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>to</b> and not send any wireless transmissions, and sent a boarding party over. Antonis was armed with three British machine guns and loaded with 4,800 tons of Welsh coal. Though Germany was not at war with Greece, the presence of Allied weapons and cargo allowed Detmers to sink her or take her as a prize. As coal was of little use to the Kriegsmarine, the weapons, ammunition, and 29 crew were transferred to Kormoran, and the boarding party scuttled her at [...] British Admiralty notifications for raider activity gave the wrong date and location for the attack, and initially attributed it to the raider Thor. Kormoran then headed southeast, avoiding the convoy routes from the Mediterranean to America or down the African coast, in order to seek vessels sailing alone and without warship escort.|$|E
5|$|The LRDG {{returned}} to Yugoslavia in February 1945, operating around Istria and Dalmatia, where Germany still held {{portions of the}} mainland and certain strategic islands. The Germans had heavily mined the southern Adriatic and were attempting to cover their shipping by moving only by night, close <b>to</b> shore, and <b>heaving</b> <b>to</b> during the day under camouflage nets. The LRDG was tasked to patrol the coast, find the ships and report their locations {{to the air force}} for bombing. This it did with success. It remained in Yugoslavia {{for the rest of the}} war.|$|R
6000|$|... "Out of {{the place}} for your lives!" [...] he {{commanded}} {{in a tone of}} thunder. I took Adèle's arm, we all rushed for the door. We had barely reached it before the floor began <b>to</b> <b>heave,</b> the windows <b>to</b> fall in, and a report like thunder deafened us! We emerged into the street, wrapped in a thick cloud of curling smoke, with masonry and fragments of furniture falling all around us. But we emerged safely, though of the Café Suisse there was scarcely left one stone upon another.|$|R
60|$|A cheer {{followed}} his remark, for {{at that moment}} it was seen that our hero had reached {{the tail of the}} eddy which was caused by the hull of the wreck, and that one of her crew had darted from the cover of the vessel's bulwarks and taken shelter under the stump of the mainmast. His object was seen in a moment, for he unhooked a coil of rope from the belaying-pins, and stood ready <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> it <b>to</b> the approaching swimmer. In making even this preparation the man ran very great risk, for the stump was but a partial shelter--each wave that burst over the side sweeping wildly round it and leaping on the man higher than his waist, so that {{it was very difficult for}} him to avoid being torn from his position.|$|R
60|$|The polacre had {{now taken}} its place to leeward {{of the other}} two vessels, and they held on in that order until the frigate was within half a mile; when she fired a gun across their bows, as signal for them <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>to.</b> The brig was now flying the British colours; her prizes the British colours, with the Spanish {{underneath}} them. At the order <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>to,</b> they were all thrown up into the wind.|$|E

2500|$|The {{environment}} {{put some}} constraints on a potential design.

60|$|The captain sent Bub {{below for}} his night-glasses. Everybody crowded to the lee-rail {{to gaze at}} the {{suspicious}} stranger, which already began to loom up vague and indistinct. In those unfrequented waters the chance was one in a thousand {{that it could be}} anything else than a Russian patrol. The captain was still anxiously gazing through the glasses, when a flash of flame left the stranger's side, followed by the loud report of a cannon. The worst fears were confirmed. It was a patrol, evidently firing across the bows of the Mary Thomas in order <b>to</b> make her <b>heave</b> <b>to.</b>|$|R

60|$|Again {{and again}} in rapid {{succession}} came these flashes of light, dull reports, and sinister hummings in the air, before the American fleet gave heed that this signal <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>to</b> had been heard.|$|E

60|$|Before the daylight, indeed, a {{tremendous}} sea was running, {{and the wind}} was blowing with terrible force from the north. Although under but a rag of canvas the brig was pressed down gunwale deep, and each wave as it struck her broadside seemed <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> her bodily <b>to</b> leeward. Malcolm on coming on deck made his way aft and glanced at the compass, and then took a long look over the foaming water towards where he knew the French coast must lie. The wind was two or three points east of north, and as the clumsy craft would not sail within several points of the wind she was heading nearly east.|$|R
50|$|<b>Heaving</b> <b>to</b> in {{the junk}} rigged yacht is simple. Simply luff the boat {{into the wind}} with the sails close hauled and then put the helm down when the forward speed is spent. The battens will tame the luffing sails. <b>Heaving</b> <b>to</b> in severe weather is done by {{dropping}} the forward junk sails into their cradle and reefing the aft junk rigged sails—both tasks that are simplified by the junk rig. <b>Heaving</b> <b>to</b> in light winds can be difficult {{due to the lack}} of sail drive up wind.|$|R
2500|$|At about 08:45 on 19 February, Alcantara was {{steaming}} north-north-east up its patrol line, lookouts spotted smoke off {{the port}} beam and Wardle manoeuvred closer {{to identify the}} source of the smoke. Unbeknownst to them, the smoke was from SMS Greif. A few minutes later Andes signalled [...] "Enemy in sight north-east 15 knots" [...] Wardle ordered Alcantara to turn north at maximum speed and soon sighted a ship with one funnel, flying Norwegian flags. Another message from Andes described a two-funnelled ship and the identity of the ship in sight remained doubtful. A few minutes later, Andes was seen to starboard seeming to be steaming north-east at speed, as if in pursuit. Before joining the chase, Wardle decided to examine the unknown ship and fired two blanks <b>to</b> force it <b>heave</b> <b>to,</b> going to action stations. By 09:20, Wardle was signalled by Andes that it had altered course to the south-east, which only added to the ambiguity, because the ship hove to could not be the one being pursued. The lookouts on the Alcantara could see the Norwegian name Rena on the stern and that the ship looked authentic.|$|R
60|$|Throughout the day, and {{as slowly}} and {{steadily}} as ever, the wind increased. It impressed one with its sullen determination to blow, and blow harder, {{and keep on}} blowing. And still the Ghost foamed along, racing off the miles till I was certain she was making at least eleven knots. It {{was too good to}} lose, but by nightfall I was exhausted. Though in splendid physical trim, a thirty-six-hour trick at the wheel was the limit of my endurance. Besides, Maud begged me <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>to,</b> and I knew, if the wind and sea increased at the same rate during the night, that it would soon be impossible <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>to.</b> So, as twilight deepened, gladly {{and at the same time}} reluctantly, I brought the Ghost up on the wind.|$|E
60|$|July 5. A steamer was sighted about midnight by the U. S. S. Hawk, {{formerly}} the yacht Hermione, off {{the north coast}} of Pinar del Rio, steaming eastward, close inshore.

60|$|The {{guns were}} already loaded; {{and as soon}} as they were run out a shot was fired, as a message to the Spaniard <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>to.</b> A minute later, as she paid no attention, a {{broadside}} followed.
