25|$|Many 19-nortestosterone derivatives, {{including}} nandrolone, trenbolone, ethylestrenol (ethylnandrol), metribolone (R-1881), <b>trestolone,</b> 11β-MNT, dimethandrolone, and others, are potent agonists of the progesterone receptor (AR) {{and hence}} are progestogens {{in addition to}} AAS. Similarly {{to the case of}} estrogenic activity, the progestogenic activity of these drugs serves to augment their antigonadotropic activity. This results in increased potency and effectiveness of these AAS as s and male contraceptives (or, put in another way, increased potency and effectiveness in producing azoospermia and reversible male infertility).|$|E
25|$|Aside from prohormones and {{testosterone}} undecanoate, {{almost all}} orally active AAS are 17α-alkylated. A few AAS {{that are not}} 17α-alkylated are orally active. Some examples include the testosterone 17-ethers cloxotestosterone, quinbolone, and silandrone, which are prodrugs (to testosterone, boldenone (Δ1-testosterone), and testosterone, respectively), the DHT 17-ethers mepitiostane, mesabolone, and prostanozol (which are also prodrugs), the 1-methylated DHT derivatives mesterolone and metenolone (although these are relatively weak AAS), and the 19-nortestosterone derivatives dimethandrolone and 11β-MNT, which have improved resistance to first-pass hepatic metabolism due to their 11β-methyl groups (in contrast to them, the related AAS <b>trestolone</b> (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone) is not orally active). As these AAS are not 17α-alkylated, they show minimal potential for hepatotoxicity.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone can be metabolized by {{aromatase}} into estradiol, {{and many}} other AAS can be metabolized into their corresponding estrogenic metabolites as well. As an example, the 17α-alkylated AAS methyltestosterone and metandienone are converted by aromatase into methylestradiol. 4,5α-Dihydrogenated derivatives of testosterone such as DHT cannot be aromatized, whereas 19-nortestosterone derivatives like nandrolone can be but to a greatly reduced extent. Some 19-nortestosterone derivatives, such as dimethandrolone and 11β-MNT, cannot be aromatized due to steric hindrance provided by their 11β-methyl group, whereas the closely related AAS <b>trestolone</b> (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone), in relation to its lack of an 11β-methyl group, can be aromatized. AAS that are 17α-alkylated (and not also 4,5α-reduced or 19-demethylated) are also aromatized but {{to a lesser extent}} than is testosterone. However, it is notable that estrogens that are 17α-substituted (e.g., ethinylestradiol and methylestradiol) are of markedly increased estrogenic potency due to improved metabolic stability, and for this reason, 17α-alkylated AAS can actually have high estrogenicity and comparatively greater estrogenic effects than testosterone.|$|E
50|$|As a {{derivative}} of the anabolic steroid hormone nandrolone (19-nortestosterone), <b>trestolone's</b> viability {{as a male}} contraceptive via spermatogenesis suppression is ten-fold in comparison to testosterone.|$|R
50|$|When LH {{release is}} inhibited, {{the amount of}} {{testosterone}} made in the testes declines dramatically. As a result of <b>trestolone's</b> gonadotropin-suppressing qualities, levels of serum testosterone fall sharply in patients. Testosterone is the primary hormone responsible for maintenance of male secondary sex characteristics.|$|R
25|$|Testosterone can be robustly {{converted}} by 5α-reductase into DHT {{in so-called}} androgenic tissues such as skin, scalp, prostate, and seminal vesicles, {{but not in}} muscle or bone, where 5α-reductase either is not expressed or is only minimally expressed. As DHT is 3- to 10-fold more potent as an agonist of the AR than is testosterone, the AR agonist activity of testosterone is thus markedly and selectively potentiated in such tissues. In contrast to testosterone, DHT and other 4,5α-dihydrogenated AAS are already 5α-reduced, and for this reason, cannot be potentiated in androgenic tissues. 19-Nortestosterone derivatives like nandrolone can be metabolized by 5α-reductase similarly to testosterone, but 5α-reduced metabolites of 19-nortestosterone derivatives (e.g., 5α-dihydronandrolone) tend to have reduced activity as AR agonists, resulting in reduced androgenic activity in tissues that express 5α-reductase. In addition, some 19-nortestosterone derivatives, including <b>trestolone</b> (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone (MENT)), 11β-methyl-19-nortestosterone (11β-MNT), and dimethandrolone (7α,11β-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone), cannot be 5α-reduced. Conversely, 17α-alkylated AAS can be 5α-reduced and are potentiated in androgenic tissues similarly to testosterone, with an exception being 17α-alkylated AAS that are already 4,5α-reduced.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Trestolone</b> (...) , {{also known}} as 7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone (MENT), is a {{synthetic}} anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) of the nandrolone (19-nortestosterone) group which was never marketed. It {{can be used to}} build muscle rapidly and is a theoretical candidate drug for use in hormonal male contraceptive methods. In males, regular administration of sufficient quantities of <b>trestolone</b> induces a reversible state of infertility. <b>Trestolone</b> is used as the acetate ester, <b>trestolone</b> acetate, which is administered via intramuscular injection and acts as a long-lasting prodrug of <b>trestolone.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other AAS {{that are}} closely related to dimethandrolone (besides nandrolone) include <b>trestolone</b> (also known as 7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone (MENT)) and 11β-methyl-19-nortestosterone (11β-MNT) and their {{respective}} C17β esters <b>trestolone</b> acetate and 11β-MNT dodecylcarbonate (11β-MNTDC).|$|E
50|$|<b>Trestolone,</b> {{also known}} as 7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone (MENT) or as 7α-methylestr-4-en-17β-ol-3-one, is a {{synthetic}} estrane steroid and a derivative of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone). It is a modification of nandrolone with a methyl group at the C7α position. Closely related AAS include 7α-methyl-19-norandrostenedione (MENT dione, trestione) (an androgen prohormone of <b>trestolone)</b> and dimethandrolone (7α,11β-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone) (the C11β methylated derivative of <b>trestolone),</b> as well as mibolerone (7α,17α-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone) and dimethyltrienolone (7α,17α-dimethyl-δ9,11-19-nortestosterone).|$|E
50|$|Normally, {{inadequate}} {{testosterone levels}} cause undesirable effects, such as fatigue, loss of skeletal muscle mass, reduced libido, and weight gain. However, the androgenic and anabolic properties of <b>trestolone</b> largely ameliorate this problem. Essentially, <b>trestolone</b> replaces testosterone's {{role as the}} primary male hormone in the body.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trestolone</b> acetate (USAN; {{developmental}} code names CDB-903, NSC-69948, U-15614; {{also known}} as 7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone 17-acetate and 7α-methylestr-4-en-17β-ol-3-one 17-acetate) is a synthetic, injected anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and derivative of 19-nortestosterone (nandrolone) that was never marketed. It is an androgen ester - specifically, the C17 acetate ester of <b>trestolone</b> (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone; MENT).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Trestolone</b> is an {{anabolic}} steroid {{that has been}} shown to significantly reduce sperm count.|$|E
50|$|In {{order for}} {{spermatogenesis}} {{to occur in}} the testes, both FSH and the male hormone testosterone must be present. By inhibiting release of FSH, <b>trestolone</b> creates an endocrine environment in which conditions for spermatogenesis are not ideal. Manufacture of sperm is further impaired by the suppression of LH, which in turn drastically curtails the production of testosterone. Sufficient regular doses of <b>trestolone</b> cause severe oligozoospermia or azoospermia, and therefore infertility, in most male patients.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{testosterone}} but {{similarly to}} 17α-alkyated AAS like methyltestosterone (17α-methyltestosterone), DMAU {{has been found}} to produce some effects indicative of potential hepatotoxicity when it was administered orally to animals. However, it is noteworthy that the effects were significantly less than those of methyltestosterone. Both DMAU and <b>trestolone</b> (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone; MENT) showed potential signs of hepatotoxicity whereas 11β-methyl-19-nortestosterone 17β-dodecylcarbonate (11β-MNTDC) showed few to no such effects, suggesting that the C7α methyl group of DMAU and <b>trestolone</b> could be an important contributing factor to their hepatotoxic potential.|$|E

It may act as a prohormone of <b>trestolone</b> (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone; MENT). MENT dione has been sold on the Internet under the name Mentabolan as a [...] "dietary supplement".|$|E
50|$|Oral 11β-MNT {{has shown}} {{little to no}} {{potential}} for hepatotoxicity in animals, similarly to testosterone but unlike 17α-alkylated AAS like methyltestosterone. The drug notably shows a much lower hepatotoxic potential than dimethandrolone and <b>trestolone</b> (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone; MENT), which may have an increased risk due to their shared C7α methyl group (although a risk that is still significantly {{lower than that of}} 17α-alkylated AAS).|$|E
50|$|Spermatozoa are {{produced}} in the testes of males in a process called spermatogenesis. In order to render a man infertile, a hormone-based male contraceptive method must stop spermatogenesis by interrupting the release of gonadotropins from the pituitary gland. Even in low concentrations, <b>trestolone</b> is a potent inhibitor of {{the release of the}} gonadotropin hormones, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH).|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, a collaboratory project {{led by the}} Population Council, the University of California, Los Angeles, and the Medical Research Council began researching a matchstick-sized implant that {{contains}} MENT (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone or <b>Trestolone),</b> a [...] "synthetic steroid that resembles testosterone." [...] Clinical trials were set to begin in 2011 or 2012, and the project was ongoing as of 2016, with hopes of gaining approval as the first reversible male contraceptive.|$|E
50|$|Many 19-nortestosterone derivatives, {{including}} nandrolone, trenbolone, ethylestrenol (ethylnandrol), metribolone (R-1881), <b>trestolone,</b> 11β-MNT, dimethandrolone, and others, are potent agonists of the progesterone receptor (AR) {{and hence}} are progestogens {{in addition to}} AAS.

50|$|Aside from prohormones and {{testosterone}} undecanoate, {{almost all}} orally active AAS are 17α-alkylated. A few AAS {{that are not}} 17α-alkylated are orally active. Some examples include the testosterone 17-ethers cloxotestosterone, quinbolone, and silandrone, which are prodrugs (to testosterone, boldenone (Δ1-testosterone), and testosterone, respectively), the DHT 17-ethers mepitiostane, mesabolone, and prostanozol (which are also prodrugs), the 1-methylated DHT derivatives mesterolone and metenolone (although these are relatively weak AAS), and the 19-nortestosterone derivatives dimethandrolone and 11β-MNT, which have improved resistance to first-pass hepatic metabolism due to their 11β-methyl groups (in contrast to them, the related AAS <b>trestolone</b> (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone) is not orally active).

50|$|In {{terms of}} the PR, {{noretynodrel}} possesses only about 6% to 19% of the affinity of norethisterone for the PRA, whereas the affinity of the two drugs for the PRB is similar (noretynodrel possesses 94% of the affinity of norethisterone for the PRB). Tibolone and the Δ4-isomer metabolite of tibolone have similar affinity for the PRs as noretynodrel and norethisterone, respectively, whereas the 3α- and 3β-hydroxylated metabolites of tibolone are virtually devoid of affinity for the PR. Since the structurally related anabolic-androgenic steroid <b>trestolone</b> (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone) {{is known to be}} a potent progestogen, suggesting that a 7α-methyl substitution does not interfere with progestogenic activity, 3α- and 3β-hydroxynoretynodrel likely are devoid of affinity for the PR similarly to the 3α- and 3β-hydroxylated metabolites of tibolone.|$|E
50|$|Testosterone can be metabolized by {{aromatase}} into estradiol, {{and many}} other AAS can be metabolized into their corresponding estrogenic metabolites as well.

50|$|Whereas {{norethisterone}} {{has virtually}} no {{affinity for the}} estrogen receptors (ERs), noretynodrel shows some, albeit very weak affinity for both the ERα and the ERβ (in terms of relative binding affinity, 0.7% and 0.22% of that of estradiol, respectively). The estrogenic activity of 3α- and 3β-hydroxynoretynodrel has never been assessed. However, while tibolone shows similar affinity for the ERs as noretynodrel, the 3α- and 3β-hydroxylated metabolites of tibolone have several-fold increased affinity for the ERs. As such, the 3α- and 3β-hydroxylated metabolites of noretynodrel may also show increased estrogenic activity, and this {{may account for the}} known estrogenic effects of noretynodrel. The Δ4-isomer of tibolone, similarly to norethisterone, is virtually devoid of affinity for the ERs. Neither tibolone nor its metabolites are aromatized, whereas <b>trestolone</b> is readily aromatized similarly to testosterone and 19-nortestosterone, and for these reasons, it is unlikely that noretynodrel or its metabolites are aromatized either. As such, aromatization likely does not {{play a role in the}} estrogenic activity of tibolone or noretynodrel. However, controversy on this matter exists, and other researchers have suggested that tibolone and noretynodrel may be aromatized in small amounts to highly potent estrogens (ethinylestradiol and its 7α-methyl derivative, respectively).|$|E
