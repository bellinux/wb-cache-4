5|$|The {{rest of the}} {{skeleton}} of Alioramus remotus is completely unknown except for three metatarsals (bones of the upper foot), but the discovery of A. altai, which is known from substantially more complete remains, has shed light on <b>the</b> <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> the genus.|$|E
5|$|According to Anthony S. Cheke and Julian Hume, <b>the</b> <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> the Mascarene grey parakeet {{suggests}} that its habits were largely terrestrial. Like the extinct Mauritian duck and the Mascarene coot, {{it appears that}} the Mascarene grey parakeet inhabited both Mauritius and Réunion. Both populations were said to be easy to hunt by capturing one individual and making it call out, which would summon an entire flock.|$|E
5|$|Carl Arend Friedrich Wiegmann (1893, 1898) {{discussed}} {{portions of}} <b>the</b> <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> A. adamsii, A. porcellanus, A. contrarius, and A. sinistralis. Walter Edward Collinge (1901, 1902) briefly noted features of A. palaceus and A. parakensis (reported as A. perversus). Haniel (1921) dissected A. contrarius and A. reflexilabris, and Bernhard Rensch published a few scattered {{notes in his}} various faunistic surveys. A few earlier notes are mentioned in Pilsbry (1900).|$|E

5|$|Consistent {{with all}} insects, <b>the</b> <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> the termite thorax {{consists}} of three segments: the prothorax, the mesothorax and the metathorax. Each segment contains a pair of legs. On alates, the wings are located at the mesothorax and metathorax. The mesothorax and metathorax have well-developed exoskeletal plates; the prothorax has smaller plates.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo also closely {{observed}} and recorded {{the effects of}} age and of human emotion on the physiology, studying in particular the effects of rage. He drew many figures who had significant facial deformities or signs of illness. Leonardo also studied and drew <b>the</b> <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> many animals, dissecting cows, birds, monkeys, bears, and frogs, and comparing in his drawings their anatomical structure with that of humans. He also {{made a number of}} studies of horses.|$|E
5|$|Pteranodon {{species are}} {{extremely}} well {{represented in the}} fossil record, allowing for detailed descriptions of their anatomy and analysis of their life history. Over 1,000 specimens have been identified, though less than half are complete enough to give researchers good information on <b>the</b> <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> the animal. Still, this is more fossil material than is known for any other pterosaur, and it includes {{both male and female}} specimens of various age groups and, possibly, species.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> 'Pachycephalosaurus' {{is poorly}} known, as only skull remains have been described. Pachycephalosaurus {{is famous for}} having a large, bony dome atop its skull, up to 25cm (10in) thick, which safely {{cushioned}} its tiny brain. The dome's rear aspect was edged with bony knobs and short bony spikes projected upwards from the snout. The spikes were probably blunt, not sharp.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> pterosaurs {{was highly}} {{modified}} from their reptilian ancestors by the adaption to flight. Pterosaur bones were hollow and air-filled, like {{the bones of}} birds. They had a keeled breastbone that was developed for the attachment of flight muscles and an enlarged brain that shows specialised features associated with flight. In some later pterosaurs, the backbone over the shoulders fused into a structure known as a notarium, which served to stiffen the torso during flight, and provide a stable support for the scapula (shoulder blade).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> {{the muscles}} and {{skeleton}} {{is described in}} the Hippocratic Corpus, an Ancient Greek medical work written by unknown authors. Aristotle described vertebrate anatomy based on animal dissection. Praxagoras identified the difference between arteries and veins. Also in the 4th century BCE, Herophilos and Erasistratus produced more accurate anatomical descriptions based on vivisection of criminals in Alexandria during the Ptolemaic dynasty.|$|E

5|$|The {{study of}} <b>the</b> <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> {{the brain is}} neuroanatomy, while the study of its {{function}} is neuroscience. A number of techniques are used to study the brain. Specimens from other animals, which may be examined microscopically, have traditionally provided much information. Medical imaging technologies such as functional neuroimaging, and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings are important in studying the brain. The medical history of people with brain injury has provided insight into the function of {{each part of the}} brain.|$|E
5|$|Though {{traditionally}} {{depicted as}} ungainly and awkward when on the ground, <b>the</b> <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> some pterosaurs (particularly pterodactyloids) {{suggests that they}} were competent walkers and runners. Early pterosaurs have long been considered particularly cumbersome locomotors due {{to the presence of}} large cruropatagia, but they too appear to have been generally efficient on the ground.|$|E
5|$|After the curacy {{was placed}} under the {{patronage}} of Christ Church, the incumbents were mostly scholars or members of the college; from 1616 to 1640 the curacy was held by Robert Burton, author of <b>The</b> <b>Anatomy</b> <b>of</b> Melancholy, who enlarged the church. In the English Civil War the medieval stained glass in the church was destroyed, {{partly due to the}} vandalism of Parliamentarian troops captured at Cirencester in 1642 and imprisoned in the church. Following the Restoration the holders of the curacy changed rapidly, often remaining in the position for only a few years at a time. From at least 1713 Christ Church leased a house in High Street to parish trustees and the profits were used for repairing the church. This continued until 1923, when the house was sold.|$|E

50|$|Paul Sereno et al. (2001) {{considered}} a similar prehistoric bird species {{from the same}} formation, Cathayornis, to be a junior synonym of Sinornis. They interpreted <b>the</b> <b>anatomies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two as very similar and sharing key autapomorphies of the pygostyle.|$|R
5|$|Amphibians have a {{juvenile}} stage and an adult stage, and the circulatory {{systems of the}} two are distinct. In the juvenile (or tadpole) stage, the circulation {{is similar to that}} of a fish; the two-chambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated, and is spread around the body and back to the heart in a single loop. In the adult stage, amphibians (especially frogs) lose their gills and develop lungs. They have a heart that consists of a single ventricle and two atria. When the ventricle starts contracting, deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs. Continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the body. Mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by <b>the</b> <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> the chambers.|$|E
5|$|Characters {{such as the}} long, narrow kidney with reflexed ureter {{and closed}} {{secondary}} ureter, the penial complex with distinct penis, which is continuous with the epiphallus, epiphallic caecum (a flagellum and an appendix), unbranched gametolytic duct, lack of vaginal accessory organs, and the basic condition of the nervous and retractor muscle systems support the inclusion of Amphidromus in the family Camaenidae. This group of snails occur {{in a wide variety}} of habitats in the tropics of Eastern Asia and Australasia, and is one of the most diverse families in the clade Stylommatophora. Though Laidlaw & Solem (1961) provided no more additional details on <b>the</b> <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> Amphidromus, subsequent studies by distinct authors, e.g., Bishop (1977) and Solem (1983), have demonstrated that the reproductive system can provide valuable data for species recognition.|$|E
5|$|Designed by {{visual effects}} artist Phil Tippett, Jabba the Hutt was {{inspired}} by <b>the</b> <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> several animal species. His body structure and reproductive processes were based on annelid worms, hairless animals that have no skeleton and are hermaphroditic. Jabba's head was modeled after that of a snake, complete with bulbous, slit-pupilled eyes and a mouth that opens wide enough to swallow large prey. His skin was given moist, amphibian qualities. Jabba's design would come to represent almost {{all members of the}} Hutt species in subsequent Star Wars fiction.|$|E
5|$|Past {{species have}} also left records of their {{evolutionary}} history. Fossils, along with <b>the</b> comparative <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> present-day organisms, constitute the morphological, or anatomical, record. By comparing <b>the</b> <b>anatomies</b> <b>of</b> both modern and extinct species, paleontologists can infer the lineages of those species. However, {{this approach is}} most successful for organisms that had hard body parts, such as shells, bones or teeth. Further, as prokaryotes such as bacteria and archaea share a limited set of common morphologies, their fossils do not provide information on their ancestry.|$|R
