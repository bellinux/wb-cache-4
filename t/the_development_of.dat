Method: The Comprehensive Early Childhood Parenting Questionnaire (CECPAQ) and the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-SE) were completed by 264 mothers of {{children between the ages of}} two and three and a half years. The children were administered the Bayley Scales Of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley III-NL). Results: Outcomes of the Pearsons product-moment correlation and multiple regression analysis showed a positive relationship between the mothers’ warmth towards the child and <b>the</b> social-emotional <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child. A relationship was not found between the mothers’ warmth and <b>the</b> motor <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child. Neither there was a relationship between <b>the</b> social-emotional <b>development</b> and <b>the</b> motor <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child. Conclusion: The warmth and support of the mother is related to <b>the</b> emotional <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child. <b>The</b> motor <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child is not related to <b>the</b> social-emotional <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child.

5|$|Another way enzyme {{malfunctions}} {{can cause}} disease comes from germline mutations in genes coding for DNA repair enzymes. Defects in these enzymes cause cancer because cells are {{less able to}} repair mutations in their genomes. This causes a slow accumulation of mutations and results in <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> cancers. An {{example of such a}} hereditary cancer syndrome is xeroderma pigmentosum, which causes <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> skin cancers in response to even minimal exposure to ultraviolet light.|$|E

A few anticonvulsants (valproate, levetiracetam and benzodiazepines) have shown antiepileptogenic properties in animal models of epileptogenesis. However, no anticonvulsant has ever achieved this in a clinical trial in humans. The ketogenic diet has been found to have antiepileptogenic properties in rats.|$|E
