5|$|In general, Greece {{enjoyed a}} period of peace and {{prosperity}} during Alexander's campaign in Asia.

5|$|Like most of South Korea's smaller cities, Gyeongju {{has seen}} a steady drop in {{population}} in recent years. From 2002 to 2008, the city lost 16,557 people.

In 2007, about 1,975 more people {{moved away from the}} city each year than moved in. During the same period, births exceeded deaths by roughly 450 per year, a significant number but not enough to offset the losses due to migration.|$|E
