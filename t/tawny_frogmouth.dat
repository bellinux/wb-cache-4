The frogmouths and bearded dragons have been observed feeding on emerging nymphs, however total nymphal mortality is estimated at under 10%.|$|E
500|$|Many species prey on {{the cane}} toad and its tadpoles in its native habitat, {{including}} the broad-snouted caiman (Caiman latirostris), the banded cat-eyed snake (Leptodeira annulata), [...] eels (family Anguillidae), various species of killifish, the rock flagtail (Kuhlia rupestris), some species of catfish (order Siluriformes), some species of ibis (subfamily Threskiornithinae), and Paraponera clavata (bullet ants). Predators outside the cane toad's native range include the whistling kite (Haliastur sphenurus), the rakali (Hydromys chrysogaster), the black rat (Rattus rattus) {{and the water}} monitor (Varanus salvator). The <b>tawny</b> <b>frogmouth</b> (Podargus strigoides) and the Papuan frogmouth (Podargus papuensis) have been reported as feeding on cane toads; some Australian crows (Corvus spp.) have also learned strategies allowing them to feed on cane toads, such as using their beak to flip toads onto their back. Opossums of the Didelphis genus likely can eat cane toads with impunity. Meat ants are unaffected by the cane toads' toxins, and therefore are able to kill them. The cane toad's normal response to attack is to stand still and let their toxin kill the attacker, which allows the ants to attack and eat the toad.|$|E
2500|$|Historic Hill {{contains}} Bird House, Bird Garden, Sea Lion Sound, Herpetarium, Chain of Lakes, Flight Cage and Cypress Swamp, and Primate House. The Bird House features birds {{as varied}} as bald eagle, rhinoceros hornbill, hyacinth macaw, burrowing owl, toco toucan, Cape thick-knee, golden pheasant, kookaburra, Mariana fruit-dove, king vulture, horned guan, superb starling, <b>tawny</b> <b>frogmouth,</b> and the Guam kingfisher, which is extinct in the wild. The Bird Garden contains outdoor bird enclosures. Sea Lion Sound provides an underwater viewing tunnel of California sea lions and three harbor seals. The herpetarium houses most of the zoo's reptiles and amphibians, including the critically endangered Jamaican iguana, Chinese alligator, McCord's box turtle, Panamanian golden frog, and Arakan forest turtle. Other species include the Komodo dragon, green anaconda, mountain chicken, spotted turtle, false gharial, king cobra, Gila monster, frill-necked lizard, Aldabra giant tortoise, tuatara, reticulated python, tiger salamander, three-toed amphiuma, pancake tortoise, and over two dozen species of pit vipers from around the world. The Chain of Lakes {{is a series of}} small enclosures between the Bird House and the Herpetarium and Primate House, where the zoo's North American river otters and alligator snapping turtles reside. In 1904, the Flight Cage was the largest bird cage ever built, and {{is still one of the}} world's largest free-flight aviaries at [...] long, [...] wide, and [...] high. The Cypress Swamp is dedicated to North American birds found it the cypress swamps of the southern Mississippi River. Among the birds in the aviary are black-crowned night heron, blue-winged teal, bufflehead duck, cattle egret, double-crested cormorant, great egret, wood duck, northern bobwhite, roseate spoonbill, snowy egret, and American white ibis. Primate House is home to the zoo's monkeys and lemurs.

50|$|<b>Tawny</b> <b>frogmouths</b> and owls {{both have}} mottled patterns, wide eyes, and anisodactyl feet. However, owls possess strong legs, {{powerful}} talons, and toes {{with a unique}} flexible joint as they use their feet to catch prey. <b>Tawny</b> <b>frogmouths</b> prefer to catch their prey with their beaks and have fairly weak feet. <b>Tawny</b> <b>frogmouths</b> roost {{out in the open}} relying on camouflage for defence and build their nests in tree forks whereas owls roost hidden in thick foliage and build their nests in tree hollows. <b>Tawny</b> <b>frogmouths</b> have wide forward facing beaks for catching insects whereas owls have narrow downwards facing beaks used to tear prey apart. The eyes of <b>tawny</b> <b>frogmouths</b> are {{to the side of the}} face while the eyes of owls are fully forward on the face. Furthermore, owls have full or partial face discs and large asymmetrical ears while <b>tawny</b> <b>frogmouths</b> do not.|$|R
5000|$|At night, <b>tawny</b> <b>frogmouths</b> emit a {{deep and}} {{continuous}} [...] "oom-oom-oom" [...] grunting at a frequency of about 8 calls in 5 seconds.

5000|$|The <b>tawny</b> <b>frogmouth</b> (Podargus strigoides) is {{a species}} of frogmouth native to Australia that is found {{throughout}} the Australian mainland and Tasmania. Tawny frogmouths are big-headed stocky birds often mistaken for owls due to their nocturnal habits and similar colouring. The <b>tawny</b> <b>frogmouth</b> is sometimes incorrectly referred to as [...] "mopoke", a common name for the southern boobook whose call is often confused for the tawny frogmouth's.|$|E
50|$|Similar species {{include the}} <b>tawny</b> <b>frogmouth.</b> The Papuan frogmouth is larger, has red eyes, a longer tail and darker wings.|$|E
50|$|The clutch {{size of the}} <b>tawny</b> <b>frogmouth</b> is one {{to three}} eggs. Both sexes share {{incubation}} of the eggs during the night whilst during the day, males incubate the eggs. For {{the duration of the}} incubation period, the nest is rarely left unattended. One partner will roost on a nearby branch and provide food for the brooding partner. Once hatched, both parents cooperate in the supply of food to the young. The fledging period of the <b>tawny</b> <b>frogmouth</b> is 25 - 35 days during which they develop half their adult mass.|$|E
50|$|Significant {{differences}} in the orientation of <b>tawny</b> <b>frogmouths</b> on branches has been observed during winter and summer months. During summer when light intensity is at maximum strength, they tend to choose positions on branches {{that do not have}} all day exposure to sunlight. Physiological testing has shown that <b>tawny</b> <b>frogmouths</b> are able to triple their breathing rate without the need to open their beaks. However, when their body temperature rises by as much as four to five degrees they will begin to pant. Faced with further heat stress, <b>tawny</b> <b>frogmouths</b> will engorge the blood vessels in the mouth to increase the flow of blood to the buccal area and produce a mucus that helps to cool air as it is inhaled and hence cool the body.|$|R
50|$|Superb Parrots and <b>Tawny</b> <b>Frogmouths</b> {{have been}} regular (bird) {{visitors}} to Mt Rogers in recent years, as recorded on the blog and its pages.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tawny</b> <b>frogmouths</b> can {{be found}} in almost any habitat type {{including}} forests and woodlands, scrub and heathland vegetation, and savannahs. However, they do not occur in heavy rainforests and treeless deserts. They are seen in large numbers in areas that are populated with many river gums and casuarinas and {{can be found}} along river courses if these areas are timbered. <b>Tawny</b> <b>frogmouths</b> are common in suburbs, having adapted to human presence. They have been reported nesting in parks and gardens with trees.|$|R

50|$|During winter, <b>tawny</b> <b>frogmouths</b> choose northerly {{oriented}} {{positions on}} branches {{that are more}} exposed to sunlight {{in order to increase}} body heat. Pair roosting and huddling to share body warmth is also common during winter months. During daylight hours, <b>tawny</b> <b>frogmouths</b> sometimes perch on the ground to sunbathe, remaining motionless for up to five minutes. During this time, the birds open their beaks wide, close their eyes, and move their head to the side to allow sunrays to penetrate beneath the thick layer of feathers.|$|R
50|$|During {{daylight}} hours, healthy <b>tawny</b> <b>frogmouths</b> {{generally do}} not actively look for food though they may sit with their mouths open, snapping it shut when an insect enters. As dusk approaches, they begin actively searching for food. <b>Tawny</b> <b>frogmouths</b> feed mainly by pouncing from a tree or other elevated perch to take large insects or small vertebrates from the ground using their beaks with great precision. Some smaller prey, such as moths, can be caught in flight. Foraging flights consist of short snatching flights to foliage, branches, or into the air.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>tawny</b> <b>frogmouth</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in 1801 by English naturalist John Latham. Its specific epithet {{is derived from}} the Latin strix meaning [...] "owl" [...] and oides meaning [...] "form". Tawny frogmouths belong to the frogmouth genus Podargus which includes the two other species of frogmouths found within Australia, the marbled frogmouth and the Papuan frogmouth. The frogmouths form a well-defined group within the order Caprimulgiformes. Although related to owls, their closest relatives are the oilbirds, potoos, owlet-nightjars, and true nightjars. The earliest fossil evidence of frogmouths are from the Eocene and imply that they diverged from their closest relatives during the early Tertiary. Three subspecies of the <b>tawny</b> <b>frogmouth</b> are currently recognised: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{island is}} home to {{endangered}} flora such as Brachychiton incanus {{and a variety of}} birdlife such as rufous night heron, little eagle, brown falcon, whimbrel, <b>tawny</b> <b>frogmouth,</b> great bowerbird and rainbow bee-eater. The agile wallaby is commonly sighted on the island.|$|E
50|$|Tawny frogmouths face {{a number}} of threats from human {{activities}} and pets. Tawny frogmouths are often killed or injured on rural roads during feeding as they fly in front of cars when chasing insects illuminated in the beam of the headlights. Large scale land clearing of eucalypt trees and intense bushfires are serious threats to <b>tawny</b> <b>frogmouth</b> populations as they tend not to move to other areas if their homes are destroyed. Household cats are the most significant introduced predator of the <b>tawny</b> <b>frogmouth,</b> however dogs and foxes are known to also occasionally kill the birds. When tawny frogmouths pounce to catch prey on the ground, they are slow to return to flight and vulnerable to attack from these predators.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tawny</b> <b>frogmouths</b> have a {{wide range}} of vocalisations that can signal {{information}} about sex, territory, food, or predators. They generally use low amplitude and low frequency sounds to communicate though some of their warning screams can be heard for miles. Nestlings make a number of unique calls expressing distress, hunger, and fear. Juveniles retain this range while developing a loud call for begging. Nestlings, juveniles, and adults all use a low amplitude annoyance call meant for family members. [...] When disturbed during rest, <b>tawny</b> <b>frogmouths</b> can emit a soft warning buzz that sounds similar to a bee and when threatened, they can make a loud hissing noise and produce clacking sounds with their bill.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tawny</b> <b>frogmouths</b> are a {{widespread}} species found {{throughout most of}} the Australian mainland except in far western Queensland, the central Northern Territory, and most of the Nullabor Plain.
