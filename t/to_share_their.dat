5|$|Comprising a UNESCO World Heritage Site {{located in}} the arid and sparsely {{populated}} Four Corners region, the Chacoan cultural sites are fragile – concerns of erosion caused by tourists {{have led to the}} closure of Fajada Butte to the public. The sites are considered sacred ancestral homelands by the Hopi and Pueblo people, who maintain oral accounts of their historical migration from Chaco and their spiritual relationship to the land. Though park preservation efforts can conflict with native religious beliefs, tribal representatives work closely with the National Park Service <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>their</b> knowledge and respect the heritage of the Chacoan culture.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{visit by}} Radama I to Madagascar's first formal school, {{established}} in Toamasina in 1818 {{by members of the}} London Missionary Society (LMS), the king invited the first Christian artisan missionaries to the capital city <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>their</b> knowledge. Beginning in December 1820, LMS missionaries established workshops in Antananarivo to teach brick-making, European carpentry and other practical skills, and developed a network of public schools where numeracy and English were taught alongside literacy using portions of the Malagasy language Bible. Despite high attendance at the schools, the LMS were initially unsuccessful in converting pupils to Christianity. Near the end of Radama's reign, the king came to regard the few Malagasy who had been converted as irreverent toward royal authority. He forbade Malagasy people from being baptized or attending Christian services.|$|E

5000|$|A {{laboratory}} study traced {{the initiation of}} private-collective innovation to the first decision <b>to</b> <b>share</b> knowledge in a two-person game with multiple equilibria. The results indicate fragility: when individuals face opportunity costs <b>to</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>their</b> knowledge with others they quickly {{turn away from the}} social optimum of mutual sharing. The opportunity costs of the [...] "second player", the second person deciding whether <b>to</b> <b>share,</b> have a bigger (negative) impact on knowledge sharing than the opportunity costs of the first person to decide. Overall, the study also observed sharing behavior in situations where none was predicted.|$|R

5|$|Germany's {{foreign policy}} {{during the war}} {{involved}} the creation of allied governments under direct or indirect control from Berlin. A main goal was obtaining soldiers from the senior allies such as Italy and Hungary and millions of workers and ample food supplies from subservient allies such as Vichy France. By the fall of 1942, there were 24 divisions from Romania on the Eastern Front, 10 from Italy and 10 from Hungary. When a country was no longer dependable, Germany assumed full control as it did with France in 1942, Italy in 1943 and Hungary in 1944. Although Japan was an official powerful ally, the relationship was distant and there was little co-ordination or co-operation. For example, Germany refused <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>their</b> formula for synthetic oil from coal {{until late in the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Halo.Bungie.Org is {{the most}} widely read Halo fansite. In 2007, it {{received}} about 600,000 page views a day. The site covers game news and rumors, strategy, fan-made machinima, stories and art, contests and forums. In the site's early years, it received {{only a small amount}} of fan-submitted material, which has ballooned since and made constant site maintenance a challenge. Errera attributes the site's longevity {{to the fact that it}} provided fans with not just Halo news but a place <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>their</b> love of the franchise.

5|$|Like most 2nd AIF units, the 2/4th drew its cadre {{staff of}} {{officers}} and senior non-commissioned officers (NCOs) from volunteers from local Militia units. These were augmented by partially trained Other Ranks (ORs) {{from the three}} local recruit training depots; the first batch of these, numbering 394 men, arrived at Northam on 27 November and a further 262 marched in on 4 December. As the battalion was brought up to its authorised strength of around 800 men, personnel were formed into four machine gun companies, 'A' to 'D', under a headquarters company consisting of several specialist platoons—including signals and anti-aircraft platoons—and battalion headquarters. There were no platoon commanders until a contingent arrived from the regional Officer Training Units. Initially training was hampered {{by a lack of}} equipment—only 12 of 48 Vickers machine guns assigned to the battalion were available—so at the start the focus was on individual rather than collective training. As more stores arrived, training accelerated with the help of experienced Militia NCOs and First World War veterans, who were brought in <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>their</b> experiences with the new troops. Just before Christmas and New Year's leave, the battalion received its distinctive Unit Colour Patch: a black and gold triangle.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Howard Thurman {{became the}} Dean of the Boston University School of Theology and, {{after ten years}} in California, the couple moved to Boston. The move was {{prompted}} by the desire <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>their</b> ideas of outreach and inclusion in a university setting, though they were aware that {{the arrival of the}} first black pastor in a white university would lead to difficulties. From the beginning, Thurman tried to create an inclusive environment, organizing monthly dinners for the Marsh Chapel Choir members and their friends. Shortly after they arrived, a Japanese student committed suicide leaving a note that she had no friends. Not only was she not known well at the university, finding her family to notify them was difficult. In response, Thurman organized the International Student Hostess Committee to keep international students from feeling isolated. By 1965, the committee was serving 500 international students at Boston University. The Thurmans were at times criticized by those who felt they should be visibly active in the Civil Rights Movement, but they believed their commitment was to addressing the spiritual needs of those who were visible, rather than participating in marches, protests and demonstrations. Among the papers of MLK were many letters from people such as Homer A. Jack, who co-founded the Congress of Racial Equality; Lillian Smith, author of the novel Strange Fruit; Glenn E. Smiley, national field secretary of Fellowship of Reconciliation, as well as King's own acknowledgement, which credited their spiritual guidance.|$|E
