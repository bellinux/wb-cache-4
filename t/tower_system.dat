25|$|A recent {{innovation}} {{has been}} the use of transpired collectors {{in place of the}} traditional glazing covers. Transpired collectors have efficiencies in the 60% to 80% range or three times the 25% efficiency measured with the greenhouse collectors. The large solar collector field can now be reduced to half or less making solar updraft towers much more cost effective. A patent has been granted on a solar <b>tower</b> <b>system</b> using transpired collectors.|$|E

500|$|The plant's {{water system}} was cooled {{by using the}} nearby River Tyne, rather than using a cooling <b>tower</b> <b>system.</b> Coal for the station was {{supplied}} from various coal mines in the North Durham coalfields, and {{was brought to the}} station by train, on what was a freight only line. Since the station's closure, this line has been upgraded for use by passenger trains and is now used as part of the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway. Once delivered to the station, coal was shunted by CEGB No. 15 [...] "Eustace Forth", which was built by Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns in 1942, and No. 13 [...] "The Barra", which was built by Hawthorn Leslie & Company in 1928.

2500|$|Destructoid's Chris Carter {{scored the}} game an 8 out of 10 {{and called it}} [...] "one of the biggest {{fighting}} games of 2015". Carter felt that as more characters are added via DLC, the game will get better over time. VideoGamer.com's Brett Phipps gave the game an 8/10 and called it [...] "absurd, gruesome ridiculous fun". Phipps mostly praised the story, character gameplay variety, and gore, but was annoyed by online [...] "hiccups". Nick Tan from Game Revolution commended the gameplay, particularly complimenting the character variations, environmental attacks, Brutalities, the Krypt, and the <b>Tower</b> <b>system.</b> Tan also liked the overall presentation and the story's concept, but missed Stage Fatalities and tag-team matches, disliked the story's ending, and felt that the game was purposefully [...] "truncated".|$|E
