5|$|In Reformed churches, only believing Christians are {{expected}} <b>to</b> <b>partake</b> <b>of</b> the Lord's Supper. Further, partakers {{are expected}} to examine and prepare themselves for the sacrament. This involves determining whether one acknowledges their sinfulness and has faith in Christ to forgive them. Christians may have some degree of doubt regarding their salvation, but they are at least {{to be aware of}} their sin and have a desire to have faith.|$|E
5|$|The papacy further refined the {{practice}} in the Mass in the Late Middle Ages, holding that the clergy alone was allowed <b>to</b> <b>partake</b> <b>of</b> the wine in the Eucharist. This further distanced the secular laity from the clergy. The laity continued {{the practice}}s of pilgrimages, veneration of relics, and belief {{in the power of}} the Devil. Mystics such as Meister Eckhart (d. 1327) and Thomas à Kempis (d. 1471) wrote works that taught the laity to focus on their inner spiritual life, which laid the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation. Besides mysticism, belief in witches and witchcraft became widespread, and by the late 15th century the Church had begun to lend credence to populist fears of witchcraft with its condemnation of witches in 1484 and the publication in 1486 of the Malleus Maleficarum, the most popular handbook for witch-hunters.|$|E
5|$|John Calvin, a very {{influential}} early Reformed theologian, believed the Lord's Supper fed Christians with the spiritual food of union with Christ. He believed {{that in the}} Supper Christians feed on Christ's flesh, which he saw as an inexplicable miracle. Calvin taught that the Supper confirms the promises communicated to Christians in the preaching of the gospel. He also saw its purpose as provoking praise for God and love for other people. He believed it necessary for Christians <b>to</b> <b>partake</b> <b>of</b> Christ's humanity in the Supper {{as well as his}} Spirit, and that the bread and wine really present, rather than simply symbolize or represent, Christ's body and blood. Calvin spoke of the communication involved in the Lord's Supper as spiritual, meaning that it originates in the Holy Spirit. Calvin's teaching on the Lord's Supper was followed by many others in the Reformed tradition, including Martin Bucer and Peter Martyr Vermigli. Calvin, like Zwingli and against Luther, did not believe that Christ is bodily present in the elements of the Eucharist. He taught that Christ remains in heaven and that we commune with him in the Lord's Supper by being raised up to him rather than him descending to us. Calvin believed the elements of the Supper to be used by God as instruments in communicating the promises which they represent, a view called symbolic instrumentalism.|$|E

5|$|The house {{seems to}} have been rebuilt since the time that Sir Samuel Morland dwelt in it. About the year 1730, Mr. Jonathan Tyers became the {{occupier}} of it, and, there being a large garden belonging to it, planted with a great number of stately trees, and laid out in shady walks, it obtained the name of Spring Gardens; and the house being converted into a tavern, or place of entertainment, was much frequented by the votaries of pleasure. Mr. Tyers opened it with an advertisement of a Ridotto al Fresco, a term which {{the people of this country}} had till that time been strangers to. These entertainments were repeated in the course of the summer, and numbers resorted <b>to</b> <b>partake</b> <b>of</b> them. This encouraged the proprietor to make his garden a place of musical entertainment, for every evening during the summer season. To this end he was at great expense in decorating the gardens with paintings; he engaged a band of excellent musicians; he issued silver tickets at one guinea each for admission, and receiving great encouragement, he set up an organ in the orchestra, and, in a conspicuous part of the garden, erected a fine statue of Mr. Handel.|$|E

25|$|This oratory, with frescoes (1602) by Antonio Viviani, {{represents}} the rebuilding by Cardinal Baronius (1602) {{of the famous}} triclinium where St. Gregory hosted a meal {{every day for a}} dozen poor men of Rome. At the massive marble table on antique Roman bases, at odds with Gregory's reputation for asceticism, John the Deacon tells that an angel joined the twelve poor men who gathered at the table <b>to</b> <b>partake</b> <b>of</b> Gregory's beneficence. The marble table-supports take the form of addorsed, winged lions whose heads sprout goats' horns.|$|E
25|$|The Memorial, held after sunset, {{includes}} a {{talk on the}} meaning of the celebration and the circulation among the audience of unadulterated red wine and unleavened bread. Jehovah's Witnesses believe the bread symbolizes Jesus Christ's body which he gave on behalf of mankind, and that the wine symbolizes his blood which redeems from sin. They do not believe in transubstantiation or consubstantiation. Because many congregations have no members who claim to be anointed, it is common for no one <b>to</b> <b>partake</b> <b>of</b> the bread and wine.|$|E
25|$|A {{growing number}} of congregations in the ELCA, offer {{instruction}} to baptized children generally {{between the ages of}} 6-8 and, after {{a relatively short period of}} catechetical instruction, the children are admitted <b>to</b> <b>partake</b> <b>of</b> the Eucharist. Most other ELCA congregations offer First Communion instruction to children in the 5th grade. In other Lutheran churches, the person must have receive confirmation before receiving the Eucharist. Infants and children who haven't received the catechetical instruction (or confirmation) may be brought to the Eucharistic distribution by their parents to be blessed by the pastor.|$|E

25|$|The diocese is {{considering}} whether the laying on of hands at confirmation could {{be performed by}} the rector of the parish. Although confirmation by a priest is common practice in Orthodoxy and is permitted in certain circumstances in Roman Catholicism, in the Anglican tradition confirmation can only be celebrated by a bishop. In 2005, possibly as a precursor to this change, the diocese formally removed the requirement <b>of</b> confirmation prior <b>to</b> <b>partaking</b> <b>of</b> communion {{for those who have}} been baptised as adults. However, it is common practice throughout the diocese to allow all adults who profess genuine repentance and Christian faith to receive communion regardless of whether they have been baptised or confirmed.|$|R
25|$|Holy {{water is}} drunk by the {{faithful}} {{after it is}} blessed {{and it is a}} common custom for the pious to drink holy water every morning. In the monasteries of Mount Athos holy water is always drunk in conjunction with consuming antidoron. Eastern Orthodox do not typically bless themselves with holy water upon entering a church as Western Catholics do, but a quantity of holy water is often kept in a font placed in the narthex (entrance) of the church, available for anyone who would like <b>to</b> <b>partake</b> <b>of</b> it or to take some of it home.|$|E
25|$|The paschal {{sacrifice}} {{belongs to}} the shelamim, thus forming one of the sacrifices in which the meal is the principal part and indicates the community between God and man. It is really a house or family sacrifice, and each household is regarded as constituting a small community in itself, {{not only because the}} lamb is eaten at home, but also because every member of the family is obliged <b>to</b> <b>partake</b> <b>of</b> the meal, on pain of ritual excommunication, although each man must be circumcised and all must be ritually clean. The fact that the paschal lamb might be killed only at the central sanctuary of Jerusalem, on the other hand, implies that each household was but a member of the larger community; this is indicated also by the national character of the sacrifice, which kept alive in the memory of the nation the preservation and liberation of the entire people.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah Berurah quotes three {{opinions}} regarding {{circumstances in}} which the fast may be broken. According to the first, a healthy individual must fast if he can sustain the fast without undue suffering and without any subsequent weakening that would affect his ability or inclination to heartily partake of his Passover Seder meal (and specifically the matzah). (If one is obligated <b>to</b> <b>partake</b> <b>of</b> a festive meal that day, such {{as if he is}} the father of an infant on the day of circumcision, this opinion requires him to undertake a reciprocal fast at the soonest opportunity.) According to the second custom (quoted by the Magen Avraham {{in the name of the}} Maharash Levi), the fast may be broken at any festive meal celebrating a circumcision or a redemption of the firstborn. According to the third custom, based upon the Maharshal (Yam Shel Sh'lomo, Bava Kamma 7:37), the fast may even be broken at a seudat mitzvah for a siyum celebrating the completion of study of a tractate of Talmud. The latter custom is commonly observed.|$|E

Of real bread whereby they could maintain life in him, he received none, {{not so much as a}} crumb and that doesn't happen even for law breakers who shall be hanged or racked.|$|R

25|$|After the {{introduction}} come {{the words of}} Kohelet. As king he has experienced everything and done everything, but nothing is ultimately reliable. Death levels all. The only good is <b>to</b> <b>partake</b> <b>of</b> life in the present, for enjoyment is from the hand of God. Everything is ordered in time and people are subject to time in contrast to God's eternal character. The world is filled with injustice, which only God will adjudicate. God and humans do not belong in the same realm and it is therefore necessary to have a right attitude before God. People should enjoy, but should not be greedy; no-one knows {{what is good for}} humanity; righteousness and wisdom escape us. Kohelet reflects on the limits of human power: all people face death, and death is better than life, but we should enjoy life when we can. The world is full of risk: he gives advice on living with risk, both political and economic. Mortals should take pleasure when they can, for a time may come when no one can. Kohelet's words finish with imagery of nature languishing and humanity marching to the grave.|$|E
25|$|The Church of the Nazarene {{stands in}} the Arminian {{tradition}} of free grace for all and human freedom to choose <b>to</b> <b>partake</b> <b>of</b> that saving grace. The Nazarene Church distinguishes itself from many other Protestant churches because of its belief that God's Holy Spirit empowers Christians to be constantly obedient to Him—similar to the belief of other churches in the Evangelical Holiness movement. The Nazarene Church {{does not believe that}} a Christian is helpless to sin every day. Rather, the Nazarene Church does teach that sin should be the rare exception {{in the life of a}} sanctified Christian. Also, there exists the belief in entire sanctification, the idea that a person can have a relationship of entire devotion to God in which they are no longer under the influence of original sin. This means that, through the power of the Holy Spirit, people can be changed so as to be able to live a holy life for the glory of God. The concept of entire sanctification stems from John Wesley's concept of spiritual perfection. This is interpreted on a variety of different levels; as with any denomination, certain believers interpret the theology more rigidly and others less so.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, the Eastern Orthodox {{church has}} {{required}} {{its members to}} have observed all church-appointed fasts (most weeks, this {{will be at least}} Wednesday and Friday) for the week prior <b>to</b> <b>partaking</b> <b>of</b> communion, and <b>to</b> fast from all food and water from midnight the night before. In addition, Orthodox Christians are to have made a recent confession to their priest (the frequency varying with one's particular priest), and they must be at peace with all others, meaning that they hold no grudges or anger against anyone. In addition, one is expected to attend Vespers or the All-Night Vigil, if offered, on the night before receiving communion. Furthermore, various pre-communion prayers have been composed, which many (but not all) Orthodox churches require or at least strongly encourage members to say privately before coming to the Eucharist.|$|R

[...] Jewish priests cannot bless a congregation after consuming alcohol.|$|E
500|$|Rebel Heart {{opens with}} the song [...] "Living for Love". Composed in the house genre, it begins with Madonna singing over a [...] "regal" [...] piano line, {{eventually}} joined by percussion. Although a breakup song, [...] "Living for Love" [...] talks about being triumphant and hopeful. According to Dean Piper of The Daily Telegraph, the song has [...] "some classic Madonna traits: religious references, a gospel choir, 90s piano beats and a whirling bass". It was compared to her 1989 singles, [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] and [...] "Express Yourself" [...] by Jason Lipshutz of Billboard. The second track, [...] "Devil Pray", was inspired by how one could be enticed <b>to</b> <b>partake</b> <b>of</b> narcotics to achieve {{a higher level of}} consciousness and connect to God. Lyrically it asks for salvation from a variety of drug abuses, making allusions to Saint Mary and Lucifer, as well as the pain of healing from drug abuse. Produced by Madonna with Falk, Avicii, DJ Dahi, and Blood Diamonds, [...] "Devil Pray" [...] starts with gentle guitar sounds which build up to an electropop production, accompanied by a house beat. [...] "Ghosttown" [...] talks about civilizations ending and the world encountering an armageddon, but humans seeing hope amid the destruction. Written with Jason Evigan, Evan Bogart, and Sean Douglas, it is a power ballad song, which Madonna sings in [...] "piercing" [...] and [...] "warm" [...] vocals like those of Karen Carpenter's, and the production is comparable to her 1986 single, [...] "Live to Tell". According to Douglas, [...] "Ghosttown" [...] was written in three days, after Madonna personally requested studio time with him and the other songwriters. The fourth track, [...] "Unapologetic Bitch", has reggae, dancehall, and dubstep influences, and is a ska song where Madonna speaks negatively about a break-up and her lover, in lyrics such as: [...] "It might sound like I'm an Unapologetic Bitch but sometimes you have to call it like it is". Madonna explained that the song is about having fun irrespective of the situation one is in.|$|E
