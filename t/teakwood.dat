5|$|Awake is an American {{television}} police procedural fantasy {{drama that}} originally aired on NBC for one season from March1 to May24, 2012. The pilot episode had an early release on Hulu on February16, 2012, {{two weeks before}} the series' premiere on television. The show's central character is Michael Britten (Jason Isaacs), a detective who works for the Los Angeles Police Department. Kyle Killen, the series' creator, was primarily responsible for the program's concept; although he served as a writer, he avowed that writing episode scripts was difficult. Killen also served as an executive producer (with David Slade) of the pilot episode. Jeffrey Reiner and Howard Gordon then continued producing (with Killen) for Gordon's <b>Teakwood</b> Lane Productions.|$|E
25|$|As the Zanj spread {{throughout}} the city, they {{put it to the}} torch. Many buildings in al-Ubulla were made of <b>teakwood</b> and were constructed close together; as a result, the fire soon {{spread throughout}} the city, destroying much of it. Many residents were killed; others attempted to flee into the waterways and drowned. The Zanj then began to plunder al-Ubulla and collected large number of spoils, but by that point most of the city's goods had been destroyed by the flames.|$|E
25|$|The {{integration}} {{into the global economy}} meant to Siam that it became a sales market for Western industrial goods and an investment for Western capital. The export of agricultural and mineral raw materials began. Including, the three products rice, pewter and <b>teakwood</b> were used to produce 90% of the export turnover. King Mongkut actively promoted the expansion of agricultural land by tax incentives, while the construction of traffic routes (canals, roads and later also railways) and the influx of Chinese immigrants allowed the agricultural development of new regions.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the stenciling, de Forest's touch {{can be seen in}} the incorporation of other Eastern designs and Tiffany glass. De Forest used carved <b>teakwood,</b> like that produced by the Ahmedabad Woodcarving Company, in the molding along the outer edge of the fireplace in Mamie Gwinn's study, as well as some picture frames in the corridor between her and Thomas's study (the Blue Room). In the third expansion of the house in 1908, de Forest decorated the ceiling of the Dorothy Vernon Room with thin sheets of patterned brass in a variety of East Indian designs. Several of the rooms also included Tiffany glass lamps or fixtures that were designed by de Forest and created in the Tiffany Studios.|$|E

500|$|Awake is a co-production of Letter Eleven and Howard Gordon's <b>Teakwood</b> Lane Productions, in {{association}} with 20th Century Fox Television. Gordon was chosen as showrunner for the series by Killen, and commended the pilot script at first glance on a flight to New York City. [...] "I read the pilot, and once I got past my envy, I {{was struck by the}} voice," [...] he stated. [...] "So few writers have real voices. Kyle is disarmingly self-effacing; and at the same time, he's disarmingly confident. It's that duality thing: On the one hand, he's open; on the other, he's closed." [...] Gordon later compared the television series to The Good Wife: [...] "The Good Wife has so many procedural aspects that they have to decide which format to use each week...Why is this an Awake episode?" [...] He and Killen served as executive producers (with David Slade and Jeffrey Reiner) for the pilot episode.|$|E
500|$|The {{architectural}} style of courtly and royal {{structures in the}} kingdom underwent profound changes during British rule – a mingling of European traditions with native elements. The Hindu temples in the kingdom were built in typical South Indian Dravidian style – a modest version of the Vijayanagara building idiom. When in power, Tipu Sultan constructed a palace and a mosque in Srirangapatna, his capital. However, it is the city of Mysore that {{is best known for}} its royal palaces, earning it the nickname [...] "City of Palaces". The city's main palace, the Mysore Palace, is also known as the Amba Vilas Palace. The original complex was destroyed by fire and a new palace was commissioned by the Queen-Regent and designed by the English architect Henry Irwin in 1897. The overall design is a combination of Hindu, Islamic, Indo-Saracenic and Moorish styles, which {{for the first time in}} India, used cast iron columns and roof frames. The striking feature of the exterior is the granite columns that support cusped arches on the portico, a tall tower whose finial is a gilded dome with an umbrella (chattri) on it, and groups of other domes around it. The interior is richly decorated with marbled walls and a <b>teakwood</b> ceiling on which are sculptures of Hindu deities. The Durbar hall leads to an inner private hall through silver doors. This opulent room has floor planels that are inlaid with semi-precious stones, and a stained glass roof supported centrally by columns and arches. The marriage hall (Kalyana mantapa) in the palace complex is noted for its stained glass octagonal dome with peacock motifs.|$|E

2500|$|The large space {{contained}} numerous chairs, couches, {{and other}} furnishings in {{a blend of}} Indian and English design. Several pieces of [...] "deliberate Anglo-Indian design" [...] were created for the Dorothy Vernon Room, consisting of a sofa (Deanery.354), two armchairs (Deanery.355–356), and two side chairs (Deanery.357–358). These pieces were made of dark wood decorated with panels of perforated copper and stenciled designs in black paint on the frame. From a 1908 photograph of the room, one can see some of Garrett's <b>teakwood</b> furniture from Baltimore (e.g. Deanery.382–383), {{as well as the}} swing settee by de Forest and his Ahmedebad Wood Carving Co. The settee is composed of intricately carved teak panels and hangs from four elaborately designed brass chains that depict three-dimensional birds, elephants, and human figures.|$|E

Inside, the burled-elm trim {{was replaced by a}} new <b>teakwood</b> design and upholstery trim patterns for vinyl and cloth selections were revised for both bucket and bench seat offerings. Engine offerings remained the same as before with the major change being the change in power measurements from the previous gross method on a dynamometer to the new net ratings as installed in a vehicle with accessories and emission equipment which made the horsepower ratings of 1972 models much lower [...] "on paper" [...] than their 1971 counterparts though actual performance did not change much between the two years.

2500|$|Despite {{the best}} efforts of {{conservation}} activists, poaching remains one of the serious problems affecting the flora and fauna in the state. Between the years 1997-2001, a total of 98 elephants have succumbed to poaching in Karnataka. Poaching has also affected the breeding of turtles like olive ridley on the beaches of Karnataka as well as otters on the river banks. Tigers are also another species that are threatened to extinction by poachers. Sandalwood, famed for its sculptures and its aroma is frequently poached out of the forests of Karnataka. <b>Teakwood,</b> famed for the furniture is another species of flora affected by this problem.

2500|$|Indo-Saracenic type is {{most notably}} {{manifested}} in palaces and courtly buildings built in various styles, and temples {{built in the}} Dravidian style. It is the city of Mysore that {{is best known for}} its royal palaces, earning it the nickname [...] "City of Palaces". The city's main palace, the Mysore Palace, was designed by the English architect Henry Irwin in 1897. The palace's exterior is Indo-Saracenic in style but the wealth of detail inside is distinctly of Hoysala. Domes, arches, colonnades and carved pillars, as well as its size, add to this palace's notability. The octagonal Kalyana mantapa (Marriage Hall) on the ground floor has 26 canvas paintings on its walls depicting the Dassera procession. On the first floor, a marble staircase leads to a grand colonnaded Durbar hall containing famous paintings, including one of the Hindu god Vishnu on the ceiling. The opulent Amba Vilas hall, with its carved <b>teakwood</b> ceiling, white marble floors, semi-precious inlay work in the Agra style, silver door with a depiction of the dashavatara and dikpalas (guardians), teak doors inlaid with ivory, Belgian stained glass, cast iron pillars from Glasgow, etched glass windows and chandeliers are worthy of mention.|$|E
2500|$|The {{design and}} {{decoration}} {{of many of}} the Deanery's interior spaces was entrusted, in large part, to the American artist Lockwood de Forest. [...] A student of the landscape painter Frederic Church, de Forest enjoyed moderate success as an artist, exhibiting his work at a variety of venues including the National Academy of Design in New York. De Forest made his living, however, as a designer and an importer of exotic goods. [...] In 1880, he and Louis Comfort Tiffany established the firm of Tiffany & de Forest, which focused largely on the importation of East Indian decorative arts. [...] By 1883, de Forest had set up his own import business, based in New York City, which distributed carved <b>teakwood</b> furniture, tracery panels, jewelry, and textiles, some of which were produced in his workshop in Ahmedabad, India. For the second and third renovations of the Deanery in 1894–1896 and 1908–1909, M. Carey Thomas consulted de Forest for the design and decoration of the Deanery's interior. De Forest's hand is clearly detectable through his incorporation of East Indian materials and designs, as well as Tiffany glass.|$|E
60|$|But this is {{no place}} for making mention of all the {{subjects}} upon which I and my Lascar friend mostly discoursed; I will only try to give his account of the <b>teakwood</b> and kayar rope, concerning which things I was curious, and sought information.|$|E
6000|$|... "One {{evening at}} {{twilight}} I was making {{my way through}} a <b>teakwood</b> forest, when I came upon a deep circular depression in an open space, in the centre {{of which was a}} rude stone temple. I was sure that {{this was one of the}} temples of the Thugs, so I concealed myself in the undergrowth to watch.|$|E
60|$|About {{this time}} {{the faces of the}} Chinese frightened me more than ever, so I ran away to the {{outskirts}} of the town and saw a windowless house that carried the Square and Compass in gold and <b>teakwood</b> above the door. I took heart at meeting these familiar things again, and knowing that where they were was good fellowship and much charity, {{in spite of all the}} secret societies in the world. Penang is to be congratulated on one of the prettiest little lodges in the East.|$|E
60|$|Sprawling {{over the}} table with arrested pen, he glanced out of the door, and in that frame of his vision he saw all the stars flying upwards between the <b>teakwood</b> jambs on a black sky. The whole lot took flight {{together}} and disappeared, leaving only a blackness flecked with white flashes, for the sea was as black as the sky and speckled with foam afar. The stars that had flown to the roll came back on the return swing of the ship, rushing downwards in their glittering multitude, not of fiery points, but enlarged to tiny discs brilliant with a clear wet sheen.|$|E
60|$|Macallister {{answered}} Grahame's shout, for the Enchantress had anchored close astern, and {{the boat}} was hanging from her davits when he followed the captain into his room. The vessels rolled lazily and the swell broke with a languid splash upon the beach, for the bight was sheltered by the reefs. The small room was lighted by an oil lamp and was very hot. A pilot coat, damp with salt, and a suit of oilskins swung to and fro across the bulkhead, {{and a pair of}} knee-boots stood in a corner. Two or three bad photographic portraits were tacked against the <b>teakwood</b> paneling, but except for these, all that the room contained suggested stern utility.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she looked}} about the vessel. The deck, finely laid with narrow planks, was {{littered}} with odd spars, rusty chain, coal bags, and pieces of greasy machinery, as if repairs and refitting were going on. She was a very small, two-masted steamer, carrying some sail, for smoke-grimed canvas was furled along the booms, and Evelyn thought she had been built for a yacht. Her narrow beam, her graceful sweep of <b>teakwood</b> rail, and the long, tapering counter suggested speed. A low, lead-gray funnel stood just forward of the mainmast, and a teak house, rising three or four feet above the deck, occupied part of her length. The brass boss of the steering wheel bore the name Enchantress. The after end of the house, however, was built of iron, with raised lights in the top, and the hammering and the pointed remarks that came up indicated that somebody below was grappling with refractory metal. After one exclamation, Evelyn's companion walked to the skylights.|$|E
60|$|The steward had lighted the {{swinging}} lamp, and {{had put a}} decanter and bottles on the table. The cuddy looked cheerful, painted white, with gold mouldings round the panels. Opposite the curtained recess of the stern windows there was a sideboard with a marble top, and, above it, a looking-glass in a gilt frame. The semicircular couch round the stern had cushions of crimson plush. The table {{was covered with a}} black Indian tablecloth embroidered in vivid colours. Between the beams of the poop-deck were fitted racks for muskets, the barrels of which glinted in the light. There were twenty-four of them between the four beams. As many sword-bayonets of an old pattern encircled the polished <b>teakwood</b> of the rudder-casing with a double belt of brass and steel. All the doors of the state-rooms had been taken off the hinges and only curtains closed the doorways. They seemed to be made of yellow Chinese silk, and fluttered all together, the four of them, as the two men entered the cuddy.|$|E
60|$|The {{front wall}} {{retreating}} made a square recess furnished like a room. A lamp with a milky glass shade, suspended below {{the slope of}} the high roof {{at the end of a}} slender brass chain, threw a bright round of light upon a little table bearing an open book and an ivory paper-knife. And, in the translucent shadows beyond, other tables could be seen, a number of easy-chairs of various shapes, with a great profusion of skin rugs strewn on the <b>teakwood</b> planking all over the veranda. The flowering creepers scented the air. Their foliage clipped out between the uprights made as if several frames of thick unstirring leaves reflecting the lamplight in a green glow. Through the opening at his elbow Captain Whalley could see the gangway lantern of the Sofala burning dim by the shore, the shadowy masses of the town beyond the open lustrous darkness of the river, and, as if hung along the straight edge of the projecting eaves, a narrow black strip of the night sky full of stars--resplendent. The famous cigar in hand he had a moment of complacency.|$|E
6000|$|... "One of my {{hungry and}} forbearing friends was {{sounding}} in the bows just below me. This steamboat was {{exactly like a}} decked scow. On the deck, there were two little <b>teakwood</b> houses, with doors and windows. The boiler was in the fore-end, and the machinery right astern. Over the whole {{there was a light}} roof, supported on stanchions. The funnel projected through that roof, and in front of the funnel a small cabin built of light planks served for a pilot-house. It contained a couch, two camp-stools, a loaded Martini-Henry leaning in one corner, a tiny table, and the steering-wheel. It had a wide door in front and a broad shutter at each side. All these were always thrown open, of course. I spent my days perched up there on the extreme fore-end of that roof, before the door. At night I slept, or tried to, on the couch. An athletic black belonging to some coast tribe and educated by my poor predecessor, was the helmsman. He sported a pair of brass earrings, wore a blue cloth wrapper from the waist to the ankles, and thought all the world of himself. He was the most unstable kind of fool I had ever seen. He steered with no end of a swagger while you were by; but if he lost sight of you, he became instantly the prey of an abject funk, and would let that cripple of a steamboat get the upper hand of him in a minute.|$|E
