5|$|Increasingly tough {{economic}} times in the early 1930s caused many theater owners to cancel plans for new construction and concentrate on attracting customers to existing theaters. Only one more cinema, <b>the</b> 2,168-seat <b>Alameda</b> Theatre (1932) in Alameda, California would ever be built by Pflueger. Commissioned by the Nasser Brothers, <b>the</b> eclectic <b>Alameda's</b> exterior incorporated deeply incised and intricate Moorish Revival rosettes on cream-colored smoothly curved sides {{on either side of}} Art Nouveau flowers in bas relief rising between eight vertical Moderne speed lines. The Art Deco interior design used imitation silver and gold leaf for accents and warm colors for a stylized mezzanine mural with a hint of Cubism. In the interest of economy, <b>the</b> <b>Alameda's</b> floor plan was nearly identical to that of the El Rey Theatre, including twin curved staircases, and some floral and geometric elements were borrowed from the Paramount.|$|R
5|$|The entire {{route is}} part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and {{is part of}} the National Highway System, a network of {{highways}} that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. The western portion is officially known as part of the Seaside Freeway, which continues to SR 1 via I-710. However, there are several at-grade intersections along the gap on Terminal Island, and Alameda Street is a surface roadway, albeit one with few intersections, as it runs alongside <b>the</b> <b>Alameda</b> Corridor rail line.|$|E
5|$|The {{school grounds}} are bordered {{on the east}} and {{southeast}} by Santa Rita Road, a Union Pacific railroad track on which the Altamont Commuter Express runs, and Arroyo Valle.

The school is the launch point for the annual Pleasanton Hometown Holidays Celebration Parade and the annual Fall Festival Parade, a part of <b>the</b> <b>Alameda</b> County Fair since the 1940s. The Fall Festival Parade, which features bands, floats, balloons, horses, and antique cars, starts on the Amador Valley parking lot, travels down Main Street, and ends near the fairgrounds.|$|E
5|$|Early maps {{show that}} the Terminal Island Freeway was to extend north to the Long Beach Freeway (I-710) near the San Diego Freeway (I-405), but the {{location}} for SR 47 adopted by the California Highway Commission on January 22, 1969 led northwest from the Terminal Island Freeway's end at Carson Street to I-405 near Alameda Street, and then paralleled that street into Los Angeles. A 1982 state law specified that SR 47 shall use Henry Ford Avenue and Alameda Street between the Heim Bridge and the Redondo Beach Freeway (SR 91), rather than the adopted alignment to the east, and in 1984 the legislature created State Route 103 to replace the former alignment on the Terminal Island Freeway between SR 47 and the Pacific Coast Highway (SR 1). Due to the cancellation of the Industrial Freeway and planned port expansions, <b>the</b> <b>Alameda</b> Corridor project was created, including an improved rail line and a widening of Alameda Street from four to six lanes south of SR 91. Alameda Street was rebuilt for the project, with grade separations at most major streets south of SR 91, and is now signed as part of SR 47 there, but remains mostly four lanes. As part of a project to replace the Heim Bridge, Caltrans and <b>the</b> <b>Alameda</b> Corridor Transportation Authority plan to improve the connection near {{the south end of}} Alameda Street, possibly by building a new expressway replacement for SR 47 south of SR 1, or by extending SR 103 northwest via the originally-planned alignment to Alameda Street south of I-405.|$|E
