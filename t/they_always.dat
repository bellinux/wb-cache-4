5|$|Although the heme {{proteins}} are {{the most}} important class of iron-containing proteins, the iron-sulfur proteins are also very important, being involved in electron transfer, which is possible since iron can exist stably in either the +2 or +3 oxidation states. These have one, two, four, or eight iron atoms that are each approximately tetrahedrally coordinated to four sulfur atoms; because of this tetrahedral coordination, <b>they</b> <b>always</b> have high-spin iron. The simplest of such compounds is rubredoxin, which has only one iron atom coordinated to four sulfur atoms from cysteine residues in the surrounding peptide chains. Another important class of iron-sulfur proteins is the ferredoxins, which have multiple iron atoms. Transferrin does not belong to either of these classes.|$|E
5|$|Females and juveniles, {{especially}} of the pale eastern subspecies, E. c. erythrogenys, may be confused with pine buntings, but <b>they</b> <b>always</b> have a yellow tint to their plumage, a paler rufous rump and more uniform upperparts than that species. Young and female yellowhammers can be distinguished from cirl buntings by the grey-brown rump of the latter species. Male hybrids with pine bunting are typically white-faced and have some yellow on the head, underparts or flight feathers, but females are usually indistinguishable from yellowhammers.|$|E

After this success Forest bought Asa Hartford and Frank Gray, though Harford was sold on after two months after Taylor realised his limited passing range did not fit Forest's style of play. Forest were denied a third consecutive League Cup win in 1980 after a defeat in the final by Wolverhampton Wanderers.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{consequences}} of the development of the entertainment industry has been the creation of new types of employment. While jobs such as writer, musician and composer exist as <b>they</b> <b>always</b> have, people doing this work are likely to be employed by a company rather than a patron as they once would have been. New jobs have appeared, such as gaffer or special effects supervisor in the film industry, and attendants in an amusement park.|$|E

5|$|The {{agricultural}} sector continued to perform poorly and by Brezhnev's final year, food shortages were reaching disturbing levels of frequency. Particularly embarrassing {{to the regime}} {{was the fact that}} even bread had become rationed, one commodity that <b>they</b> <b>always</b> prided themselves on being available. One reason for this was excessive consumer demand as food prices remained artificially low while incomes had trebled over the last 20 years. Despite the miserable failure of collective farming, the Soviet government remained committed to reducing imports of foodstuffs from the West even though they cost less than domestic production, not only for reasons of national pride, but out of fear of becoming dependent on capitalist countries for basic necessities.|$|E
5|$|Transition metals {{are usually}} present as trace {{elements}} in organisms, with zinc and iron being most abundant of those. These metals {{are used in}} some proteins as cofactors and are essential for the activity of enzymes such as catalase and oxygen-carrier proteins such as hemoglobin. Metal cofactors are bound tightly to specific sites in proteins; although enzyme cofactors can be modified during catalysis, <b>they</b> <b>always</b> return to their original state {{by the end of}} the reaction catalyzed. Metal micronutrients are taken up into organisms by specific transporters and bind to storage proteins such as ferritin or metallothionein when not in use.|$|E

Edge made a surprise appearance on the April 23, 2012 episode of Raw, confronting his long-time rival John Cena about Brock Lesnar. He mentioned that despite sharing the biggest rivalry of their careers, <b>they</b> <b>always</b> shared mutual admiration for professional wrestling. In an act of motivation, he told Cena to 'wake up' and beat Brock Lesnar. He also mentioned beforehand that he was not supposed to be on the show that night, also declaring that he would no longer be under contract with WWE in a couple of days. After this, his contract with the WWE had legitimately expired. On the September 21, 2012 episode of SmackDown, Edge made an appearance addressing Team Hell No.|$|E

5|$|The Spotted Saddle Horse is a horse breed {{from the}} United States that was {{developed}} by crossing Spanish-American type gaited pinto ponies with gaited horse breeds, such as the Tennessee Walking Horse. The result was a colorful, smooth-gaited horse, used in the show ring and for pleasure and trail riding. Two registries have been created for the breed, one in 1979 {{and the other in}} 1985. The two have similar registration requirements, although one has an open stud book and the other is slightly more strict with regard to parentage requirements, having a semi-closed stud book. The Spotted Saddle Horse is a light riding horse, always pinto in color. Solid-colored foals from registered parents may be registered for identification purposes, so their pinto-colored foals have documented parentage. <b>They</b> <b>always</b> perform an ambling gait, rather than a trot, in addition to the gaits of walk and canter, performed by all breeds.|$|E
5|$|The last {{stage of}} rocky planet {{formation}} is the merger stage. It begins when {{only a small}} number of planetesimals remains and embryos become massive enough to perturb each other, which causes their orbits to become chaotic. During this stage embryos expel remaining planetesimals, and collide with each other. The result of this process, which lasts for 10 to 100million years, is the formation of a limited number of Earth sized bodies. Simulations show that the number of surviving planets is on average from 2 to 5. In the Solar System they may be represented by Earth and Venus. Formation of both planets required merging of approximately 10–20 embryos, while an equal number of them were thrown out of the Solar System. Some of the embryos, which originated in the asteroid belt, are thought to have brought water to Earth. Mars and Mercury may be regarded as remaining embryos that survived that rivalry. Rocky planets, which have managed to coalesce, settle eventually into more or less stable orbits, explaining why planetary systems are generally packed to the limit; or, in other words, why <b>they</b> <b>always</b> appear to be at the brink of instability.|$|E
5|$|Karas is {{the title}} for the city's {{appointed}} agents. Capable of transforming into automobiles and aircraft, they are suits of armor animated by human souls infused into them through Yurine's chanting of a Shinto prayer. Director Sato told his animators to enhance the Karas dark nature by drawing their faces in shadows. Fight scenes involving Karas take place mostly in dark settings shrouded with steam or lit with spotlights. Animators touched up film frames by hand, creating an effect different from cel-shaded animation. To make the Karas more menacing, they highlighted the eyes as if light bulbs were shining through them, a technique inspired by the suitmation practice of using light bulbs for the eyes of costumes. Producer Takaya Ibira explained the presence of ravens in Tokyo and the Tower of London, inspired him and Sato to model the agents of the city after them. He stated ravens {{are believed to be}} omens of good and bad in superstitions, and <b>they</b> <b>always</b> seem to be watching over the cities. This resonated with his view of the raven in the story Noah's Ark, which cursed Noah as it scouted for land. The presence of ravens all over Tokyo led Ibira to notice the same of cats and conceive the Yurines as catgirls.|$|E
