5|$|This brought Justinian {{to search}} for an accord with Thurisind to stop the trans-Danubian raids, and the latter was more <b>than</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> accept. Thurisind's envoys asked for an {{alliance}} like the one bonding Byzantines and Lombards. In addition to strengthening the alliance, they demanded, and got, 12senators to swear to uphold the treaty. After this, in 551, 400Gepids were sent to fight in Narses' army, which was sent to Italy—a modest army compared to the 5,500Lombards sent by Audoin and the thousands of Heruli.|$|E

Another first-year at {{the dormitory}} named Kana Suoin meets Mizuho {{on the day he}} moves in, and soon after Mizuho becomes her Oneesama. Kana is more <b>than</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> serve Mizuho any way she can, since she admires him immensely. A hyperactive ghost resides in Mizuho's room named Ichiko Takashima and is shown to speak very fast when excited. She says that Mizuho looks very much like her previous Elder love interest, who turns out to be Mizuho's deceased mother. The student council president at Seio is Takako Itsukushima who tends to have a serious personality.|$|E

5|$|Lonely and needing {{someone to}} care for his {{children}} and help with the sewing and other chores, Mala takes the young girl Iva as his new wife. But Mala still longs for Aba, and their relationship is a cold one. The Eskimos go hunting caribou by stampeding the animals into a lake and then hunting them with bow and arrow and spears from boats. Mala is haunted by Aba's death, and after pouring out his grief through dance and prayer he changes his name to Kripik. Kripik's attitude toward Iva softens dramatically, and they make love. The hunter whom Mala welcomed to the village the previous year returns to his village, and gives Kripik his wife in gratitude. The woman is more <b>than</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> live with Mala, and Mala makes love to her as well.|$|E
5|$|Without a peace treaty, MacArthur {{decided not}} to resign {{while at the same}} time writing letters to Wood saying he would be more <b>than</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> accept the Republican {{nomination}} if it were offered to him. In late 1947 and early 1948, MacArthur received several Republican grandees in Tokyo. On 9 March 1948 MacArthur issued a press statement declaring his interest in being the Republican candidate for president, saying he would be honored if the Republican Party were to nominate him, but would not resign from the Army to campaign for the presidency. The press statement had been forced by Wood, who told MacArthur that it was impossible to campaign for a man who was not officially running for president, and that MacArthur could either declare his candidacy or see Wood cease campaigning for him. MacArthur's supporters made a major effort to win the Wisconsin Republican primary held on 6 April 1948. MacArthur's refusal to campaign badly hurt his chances and it was won to everybody's surprise by Harold Stassen. The defeat in Wisconsin followed by defeat in Nebraska effectively ended MacArthur's chances of winning the Republican nomination, but MacArthur refused to withdraw his name until the 1948 Republican National Convention which was won by Governor Thomas Dewey of New York.|$|E

25|$|In 1595 the Spanish, {{frustrated}} by the twenty-year rebellion of their Dutch subjects, closed their home ports to rebel shipping from the Netherlands cutting them off from the critical salt supplies necessary for their herring industry. The Dutch responded by sourcing new salt supplies from Spanish America where colonists were more <b>than</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> trade. So large numbers of Dutch traders/pirates joined their English and French brethren on the Spanish main.|$|E

25|$|The German army, always {{short of}} equipment, was always more <b>than</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> employ as much {{captured}} materiel {{as possible and}} T-34s were not an exception. Fighting on the Eastern Front saw large numbers of T-34s captured, though few were T-34-85s. These were designated by the Germans as Panzerkampfwagen T-34 747(r). From late 1941, captured T-34s were transported to a German workshop for repairs and modification to German requirements. In 1943 a local tank factory in Kharkiv was used for this purpose. These were sometimes modified to German standards by the installation of a German commander’s cupola and radio equipment.|$|E

Pearson was more <b>than</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> help Masterman because he also served in the Twenty Committee (though not a member) as the wartime head of the counterintelligence division of the Office of Strategic Services. Yale had contributed many scholars and students to the OSS, and Chester B. Kerr, director of the press, saw the importance of the book historically and commercially.|$|E

He later switched to Head Ti Radical racket and Head's LiquidMetal Radical racket, having signed a multimillion-dollar endorsement deal with Head in 1993. He renewed his contract in 1999 and in November 2003, he signed a lifetime agreement with Head. He also endorses Penn tennis balls. On July 25, 2005, Agassi left Nike after 17 years and signed an endorsement deal with Adidas. A major reason for Agassi leaving Nike was because Nike refused to donate to Agassi's charities, and Adidas was more <b>than</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> do so.

25|$|While {{his colleagues}} saw {{football}} {{as a marketing}} and public relation investment and were quite ready to siphon funds out of their main business to keep their teams afloat and replenish their player roster Spinelli saw Genoa as another business whose main aim was that of generating revenue for its owner (namely, himself) and so was more <b>than</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> sell esteemed players for hefty revenues of which just a minimal fraction was then re-invested in the team, often for the acquisition of lesser-valued replacements or virtual unknowns. Thus he proved all-too-eager to sell Uruguayan striker Carlos Aguilera and to replace him with the markedly inferior Kazuyoshi Miura from the Japanese Yomiuri Verdy (a deal that especially pleased him since the Japanese sponsors were actually paying him to let Miura play in Italian Serie A).|$|E
25|$|Gorbachev {{continued}} to work on drafting a new treaty of union which would have created a truly voluntary federation in an increasingly democratised Soviet Union. The new treaty was strongly supported by the Central Asian republics, who needed the economic power and markets of the Soviet Union to prosper. However, the more radical reformists, such as Russian SFSR President Boris Yeltsin, were increasingly convinced that a rapid transition {{to a market economy}} was required and were more <b>than</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> contemplate the disintegration of the Soviet Union if that was required to achieve their aims. Nevertheless, a referendum {{on the future of the}} Soviet Union was held in March (with a referendum in Russia on the creation of a presidency), which returned an average of 76.4% in the nine republics where it was taken, with a turnout of 80% of the adult population. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Armenia, Georgia and Moldova did not participate. Following this, an April meeting at Novo-Ogarevo between Gorbachev and the heads of the nine republics issued a statement on speeding up the creation of a new Union treaty.|$|E
25|$|In 1595, the Spanish, {{frustrated}} by the 20-year rebellion of their Dutch subjects, closed their home ports to rebel shipping from the Netherlands, cutting them off from the critical salt supplies necessary for their herring industry. The Dutch responded by sourcing new salt supplies from Spanish America where colonists were more <b>than</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> trade. So large numbers of Dutch traders/pirates joined their English and French brethren trading on the remote coasts of Hispaniola. In 1605, Spain was infuriated that Spanish settlements on the northern and western coasts of the island persisted in carrying out large scale and illegal trade with the Dutch, who were at that time fighting a war of independence against Spain in Europe and the English, a very recent enemy state, and so decided to forcibly resettle their inhabitants closer {{to the city of}} Santo Domingo. This action, known as the Devastaciones de Osorio, proved disastrous; {{more than half of the}} resettled colonists died of starvation or disease, over 100,000 cattle were abandoned, and many slaves escaped. Five of the existing thirteen settlements on the island were brutally razed by Spanish troops including the two settlements on the territory of present-day Haiti, La Yaguana, and Bayaja. Many of the inhabitants fought, escaped to the jungle, or fled to the safety of passing Dutch ships This Spanish action was counterproductive as English, Dutch, and French pirates were now free to establish bases on the island's abandoned northern and western coasts, where wild cattle were now plentiful and free.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Happy</b> Birthday <b>to</b> Me began {{production}} in early July 1980. At the helm was the British director J. Lee Thompson, {{famous for the}} classic Cape Fear (1962). Thompson had also been a dialogue coach to Alfred Hitchcock years before. Thompson had actively been looking to direct a thriller, so he {{jumped at the chance}} <b>to</b> work on <b>Happy</b> Birthday <b>to</b> Me. In the press pack he stated, [...] "What attracted me to this script was that the young people stood out as vivid, individual characters. The difference between a good chiller and exploitative junk, at least in my opinion, is whether or not you care about the victims." [...] Jack Blum, who played Alfred in the film, said that Thompson took the film seriously. Thompson would later direct the Charles Bronson slasher 10 to Midnight (1983), which featured more exploitative material <b>than</b> <b>Happy</b> Birthday <b>to</b> Me.|$|R

500|$|Judge Dredd creator John Wagner, who {{had been}} {{critical}} of the 1995 adaptation, gave a positive review of Dredd. He said: [...] "I liked the movie.

Olivia Thirlby excelled as Anderson...The character and storyline are pure Dredd." [...] Dredd has been recognised as a cult film since its release.
