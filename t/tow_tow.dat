40|$|Keywords:kevlar/epoxy composite, microcracks, crimp angle, weave textile Abstract. This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the evaluation of the parameters of plain weave textile from Kevlar 49 fibers. They were determined following the basic parameters of the textiles e. g. crimp length, crimp amplitude, thickness of the woven fabric, dimensions of the cross-sectional <b>tow</b> (<b>tow</b> width, tow height) and crimp angle. The number of fibers in the warp and tow strands was also determined. The work is also concerned with the analysis of microcracks in the material, that is, microcracks that appeared after the tensile test. Microscopic observation of cracks occurred on the test specimen strip according to DIN EN ISO 14129 for tensile testing. Strips of the material were cut,the metallurgical methods used being kept perpendicular to the thickness of the test specimen. Microcracks occurred in the individual planes located in the chosen reference axis. Microcracks were detected in the entire width of the specimen. The types of microcracks were determined by the length and traits of the microcracks...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHedgehog (Hh) {{signalling}} plays {{a crucial}} role in the development and patterning of many tissues in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Aberrations in this pathway lead to severe developmental defects and cancer. Hh signal transduction in receiving cells is a well studied phenomenon; however questions still remain concerning the mechanism of repression of the pathway activator Smoothened (Smo) in the absence of Hh. Here we describe a novel repressor of the Hh pathway, Target of Wingless (<b>Tow).</b> <b>Tow</b> represents the Drosophila homolog of a conserved uncharacterised protein family. We show that Tow acts in Hh receiving cells, where its overexpression represses all levels of Hh signalling, and that this repression occurs upstream or at the level of Smo and downstream of the Hh receptor Patched (Ptc). In addition, we find that like Ptc, overexpression of Tow causes an accumulation of lipophorin in the wing disc. We demonstrate that loss of tow enhances different ptc alleles in a similar manner to another pathway repressor, Suppressor of Fused (SuFu), possibly through mediating Ptc dependant lipophorin internalisation. Combined, these results demonstrate that Tow is an important novel regulator of the Hh pathway in the wing imaginal disc, and may shed light on the mechanism of Ptc repression of Smo...|$|E
