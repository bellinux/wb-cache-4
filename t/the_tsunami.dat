5|$|In tsunami prone regions, strong {{earthquakes}} {{serve as}} familiar warnings, {{and this is}} especially true for earthquakes in Indonesia. Previous estimates of <b>the</b> <b>tsunami</b> hazard for the Java coastline may have minimized the risk to the area, and to the northwest along the Sumatran coast, the risk is substantially higher for tsunami, especially near Padang. Previous events along the coast of Java in 1921 and again in 1994 illustrate the need for an accurate assessment of the threat. The July 2006 earthquake had an unusually slow rupture velocity which resulted in minor shaking on land for around three minutes, but the intensity was very light relative to the size of <b>the</b> <b>tsunami</b> that followed.|$|E
5|$|In 1833 a large {{earthquake}} on {{the west}} coast of Sumatra struck up a tsunami which destroyed much of Padang. The mosque was one of several buildings which survived <b>the</b> <b>tsunami.</b> Its stone floor was later replaced by a mixture of clam shells and pumice.|$|E

Since May 2004, citing his close ties with South Africa, including that being where his mother was raised, he began supporting the South Africa-Swiss charity IMBEWU which helps children better connect to sports and social and health awareness. Later, In 2005, Federer visited South Africa to meet the children that had benefited from his support. In 2005, he auctioned his racquet from his US Open championship to aid victims of Hurricane Katrina. At the 2005 Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells, Federer arranged an exhibition involving several top players from the ATP and WTA tour called Rally for Relief. The proceeds went {{to the victims of}} <b>the</b> <b>tsunami</b> caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. In December 2006 he visited Tamil Nadu, one of the areas in India most affected by <b>the</b> <b>tsunami.</b> He was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador by UNICEF in April 2006 and has appeared in UNICEF public messages to raise public awareness of AIDS.|$|E

30|$|If <b>the</b> {{evidence}} regarding <b>tsunamis</b> in folklore {{or historical}} documents is reliable, {{it appears that}} the boulders in this region were moved by past tsunamis. However, we have no data to suggest that the boulders on Lanyu Island were transported by tsunamis. Thus, we conclude that the boulders were moved by storm waves, particularly those associated with typhoons. Based on the numerical simulation, the boulders could not have been moved by <b>the</b> <b>tsunamis,</b> but instead could have been moved by storm waves. This suggests that the boulders moved by tsunamis would be relocated by storm waves, if the runup heights of <b>the</b> <b>tsunamis</b> were less than 10 to 15  m, which is almost equal to that of <b>the</b> computed <b>tsunamis.</b>|$|R

5|$|Just as {{with other}} waves, moving into shallow water causes <b>the</b> <b>tsunami</b> to slow but grow in height. Either the trough or the crest of <b>the</b> <b>tsunami</b> can arrive at the coast first. In the former case, the sea draws back and leaves subtidal areas unusually exposed. When the crest arrives, it does not usually break but rushes inland, {{flooding}} all in its path. Much of the disaster's destruction can be produced by these flood waters, which drain back into the sea while pulling people and debris along. Several tsunamis {{can be caused by}} a single geological event. In such cases, it is common for the later waves to arrive between eight minutes and two hours after the first, which may not be the biggest or most destructive. Occasionally, in a shallow bay or estuary, a tsunami may transform into a bore.|$|E
5|$|Officials in Indonesia {{received}} {{information regarding}} <b>the</b> <b>tsunami</b> {{in the form}} of bulletins from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center and the Japan Meteorological Agency, but wanted to avoid panic, and did not attempt to disseminate the advisories to the public. Virtually no time was available to make that sort of effort (had the intention been to communicate the danger with the public) because some community leaders were sent text messages with pertinent information only minutes prior to the arrival of the first waves. <b>The</b> <b>tsunami</b> affected the coast of Java comprising mostly fishing villages and beach resorts that were unscathed following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, and was also only several hundred kilometers distant from the region that saw heavy destruction just several months prior during the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Operation Crossroads {{began with}} the first blast (Test Able), an air burst on 1 July 1946; Nagato was not close to ground zero and was only lightly damaged.

40|$|A {{statistical}} analysis of <b>the</b> <b>tsunamis</b> caused by earthquakes in Indonesia was car· ried out to evaluate <b>the</b> frequency of <b>tsunamis.</b> After a geographical and chronological consideration of <b>tsunami</b> occurrence and <b>the</b> distribution of <b>tsunami</b> sources, recurrence of tsunami was analyzed with an assumption that tsunami occurrence follows a Poisson process. For <b>the</b> analysis of <b>tsunamis</b> with a variable of tsunami intensity, it seemed preferable to introduce a modified Poisson process.

30|$|If {{the range}} of the {{above-mentioned}} standard deviation of the log-scaled residual error is considered, <b>the</b> initial <b>tsunami</b> height at a coastal tidal station is likely to be within 10 - 0.135 (73 %) to 100.135 (136 %) of <b>the</b> corrected <b>tsunami</b> height calculated by Eq.

If a range of twice the standard deviation is considered, then most of <b>the</b> initial <b>tsunami</b> height at a coastal tidal station can be expected to be within 54 – 186 % of <b>the</b> corrected <b>tsunami</b> value. In <b>the</b> same way, if {{the range of}} the standard deviation (or twice the standard deviation) is considered, <b>the</b> maximum <b>tsunami</b> amplitudes at a coastal tidal station is likely to be within 68 – 148 % (or 46 – 218 %) of <b>the</b> corrected <b>tsunami</b> amplitude calculated by Eq.

30|$|When all <b>the</b> {{computed}} <b>tsunami</b> {{time series}} were carefully examined, {{it was determined}} that even the computed time series of <b>the</b> <b>tsunamis</b> with PIN and YAN sources were quite close to each other. The YAN source, with a leading depression wave propagating toward Haydarpaşa Port, was more effective than the PIN source in the study area. Thus, the YAN source was used as input for the near-field high-resolution simulations for <b>the</b> assessment of <b>tsunami</b> resilience at Haydarpaşa Port.|$|R
30|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that all four <b>tsunami</b> deposits of <b>the</b> present study occur close to the inundation limit of <b>the</b> 2011 Tohoku–oki <b>tsunami.</b> <b>The</b> 2011 <b>tsunami</b> inundation was affected by artificial embankments. For that reason, {{it is difficult to}} compare the extent of inundation of <b>the</b> 2011 <b>tsunami</b> and older tsunamis directly. However, it is reasonable to speculate that the local sizes of paleo-tsunamis were equivalent to those of the 2011 Tohoku-oki or 1896 Meiji Sanriku tsunamis when we consider the landward extent of each tsunami deposit. Future numerical modeling is needed to elucidate the sources of <b>the</b> pre-historical <b>tsunami</b> events.|$|R
40|$|On May 26, 1983, a great {{earthquake}} {{by which}} huge tsunamis were taken place occurred offNoshiro, Akita Prefecture in the Japan Sea. <b>The</b> <b>tsunamis</b> resulted in disasters along the coastalareas of the Japan Sea.

5|$|The 2004 Indian Ocean {{earthquake}} was an undersea, megathrust {{earthquake that}} occurred on 26 December 2004, with an epicentre off {{the west coast}} of Sumatra, Indonesia, triggering a series of devastating tsunamis along coastal fringes of the Indian Ocean. Nagapattinam district was the most affected part of Tamil Nadu, accounting for 6,064 off the 8,009 casualties in the state. Sirkazhi remained mostly unaffected by <b>the</b> <b>tsunami,</b> but the groundwater quality deteriorated where aquifers were close to the water bodies. There was heavy salt water intrusion inland.|$|E
30|$|The gently sloping {{topography}} and low-energy wave {{environment of}} the study area promotes <b>the</b> preservation of <b>tsunami</b> deposits.

30|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that on coral reefs, <b>the</b> magnitude of <b>tsunamis</b> can be {{strongly influenced by}} the morphology of the reef crest and beach ridge, both of which reduce <b>the</b> <b>tsunami’s</b> energy. For example, on Taketomi Island, located just 5  km south of Ishigaki Island, damage from <b>the</b> 1771 <b>tsunami</b> was reportedly slight (Makino 1968) (Fig.  1). Taketomi Island is protected by Sekisei Lagoon, which is 10 – 20  m deep and has formed within the barrier reefs (Kan and Kawana 2006) between the southwestern coast of Ishigaki Island and the eastern coast of Iriomote Island, and includes Taketomi and Kuro Islands (Machida et al. 2001). It is probable that this large lagoon greatly reduced <b>the</b> <b>tsunami’s</b> energy before it reached Taketomi Island (Goto et al. 2010). Therefore, the examination of local geomorphological features is essential when evaluating Ando et al.’s (2018) estimate, although, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, there have been no previous studies of the local geomorphology.|$|R
30|$|Although {{combination}} transliterations are theoretically {{possible in}} English, {{they seem to}} occur comparatively infrequently.

5|$|As {{the largest}} {{earthquake}} in California since the 1989 Loma Prieta event several years earlier, the mainshock caused a non-destructive tsunami that quickly reached the coast, and eventually Alaska and Hawaii several hours later. <b>The</b> <b>tsunami</b> was significant {{not because of}} its run-up, {{but because of the}} speed with which it reached the coast and for how long the waves persisted. Other strong earthquakes have affected the same area, with some that were clearly associated with the (interplate) Mendocino Fracture Zone, and others (like the two shocks on April 26) were intraplate earthquakes that ruptured within the Gorda Plate, but events that are unequivocally associated with the Cascadia subduction zone are very infrequent.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{casualties}} and damage were caused by a tsunami affecting the west coasts of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, {{and it was one}} of three tsunamis to occur within a span of six months. Runup heights were measured shortly after the earthquake and reached heights of up to 9.9 meters, though the average height was 3 to 8 meters. <b>The</b> <b>tsunami</b> was disproportionately large for its surface wave magnitude, or Ms, and the duration of the rupture process was 100 s, unusually long for its size. The moment magnitude was 7.6, larger than the 20-s Ms of 7; this Ms–Mw difference is a characteristic of tsunami earthquakes. Tide gages were set up at Corinto and Puerto Sandino, which showed an impulsive tsunami originating 61 minutes after the earthquake.
