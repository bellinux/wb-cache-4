On [...] "Speaker's Journal" [...] on his {{official}} House website, Hastert wrote in his first post: [...] "This is Denny Hastert and welcome to my blog. This is new to me. I can’t say I’m much of a techie. I {{guess you could say}} my office is teaching <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>guy</b> new tricks. But I'm excited. This is the future.

500|$|Ruth {{had asked}} Yankees general manager Ed Barrow for {{permission}} to barnstorm. Barrow had no objection but warned Ruth he must obtain Landis's consent. [...] Landis biographer Spink, {{who was at the}} time the editor of The Sporting News, stated, [...] "I can say that Ruth {{knew exactly what he was}} doing when he defied Landis in October, 1921. He was willing to back his own popularity and well-known drawing powers against the Judge." [...] Ruth, to the commissioner's irritation, did not contact Landis until October 15, one day before the first exhibition. When the two spoke by telephone, Landis ordered Ruth to attend a meeting with him; Ruth refused, stating that he had to leave for Buffalo for the first game. Landis angrily refused consent for Ruth to barnstorm, and after slamming down the receiver, is recorded as saying, [...] "Who the hell does that big ape think he is? [...] That blankety-blank! [...] If he goes on that trip it will be one of the sorriest things he has ever done." [...] By one account, Yankees co-owner Colonel Tillinghast Huston attempted to dissuade Ruth as he departed, only to be told by the ballplayer, [...] "Aw, tell <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>guy</b> to jump in a lake." ...|$|E
500|$|On 19 May 2010, The Sporting News named Henrik their 2009–10 Player of the Year. He {{received}} 108 first-place votes {{out of the}} 353 NHL players, {{coaches and}} executives polled. Ovechkin received 86 first-place votes while Sidney Crosby received 72 first-place votes. Henrik was also voted by his countrymen in the league to receive the Viking Award as the NHL's best Swedish player. At the NHL Awards Show the following month on 23 June, Henrik, Ovechkin and Crosby were up for both the Hart Memorial Trophy, awarded to the player deemed by the media {{to be the most}} valuable to his team, and the Ted Lindsay Award, given to the best player as voted by the NHL Players' Association (NHLPA). After losing the Ted Lindsay Award to Ovechkin, Henrik was awarded the Hart, becoming the first Canuck and second Swedish player (after Peter Forsberg in 2003) to win the trophy. Henrik garnered 894 voting points, compared to Ovechkin's 834 and Crosby's 729. He admitted afterwards to feeling like the underdog going into the awards ceremony, noting [...] " [...] are the faces of the sport ... to be standing next to them as <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>guy,</b> it's a strange feeling." [...] He was additionally named to the NHL First All-Star Team; at the same time, twin Daniel was named to the NHL Second All-Star Team. It marked the first time since Phil and Tony Esposito in 1973–74 that two brothers were named post-season NHL All-Stars.

David Chater in The Times stated, [...] "There {{is nothing}} wrong with the comic performances, but such an unashamedly old-fashioned format is strangely at odds with its subject matter.
