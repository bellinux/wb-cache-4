5|$|Owing in part {{to their}} vast size, abyssal plains are {{believed}} to be major reservoirs of biodiversity. They also exert significant influence upon ocean carbon cycling, dissolution of calcium carbonate, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations over <b>time</b> <b>scales</b> of a hundred to a thousand years. The structure of abyssal ecosystems are strongly influenced by the rate of flux of food to the seafloor and the composition of the material that settles. Factors such as climate change, fishing practices, and ocean fertilization have a substantial effect on patterns of primary production in the euphotic zone.|$|E
5|$|The high {{population}} of the asteroid belt makes for a very active environment, where collisions between asteroids occur frequently (on astronomical <b>time</b> <b>scales).</b> Collisions between main-belt bodies with a mean radius of 10km are expected to occur about once every 10 million years. A collision may fragment an asteroid into numerous smaller pieces (leading {{to the formation of}} a new asteroid family). Conversely, collisions that occur at low relative speeds may also join two asteroids. After more than 4 billion years of such processes, the members of the asteroid belt now bear little resemblance to the original population.|$|E

5|$|While the North and South {{magnetic}} poles are usually {{located near the}} geographic poles, they can wander widely over geological <b>time</b> <b>scales,</b> but sufficiently slowly for ordinary compasses to remain useful for navigation. However, at irregular intervals averaging several hundred thousand years, the Earth's field reverses and the North and South Magnetic Poles relatively abruptly switch places. These reversals of the geo{{magnetic poles}} leave a record in rocks that are of value to paleomagnetists in calculating geomagnetic fields in the past. Such information in turn is helpful in studying the motions of continents and ocean floors {{in the process of}} plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|Cassini {{observations}} {{provided a}} much {{closer look at}} the crater distribution and size, showing that many of Enceladus' craters are heavily degraded through viscous relaxation and fracturing. Viscous relaxation allows gravity, over geologic <b>time</b> <b>scales,</b> to deform craters and other topographic features formed in water ice, reducing the amount of topography over time. The rate at which this occurs is dependent on the temperature of the ice: warmer ice is easier to deform than colder, stiffer ice. Viscously relaxed craters tend to have domed floors, or are recognized as craters only by a raised, circular rim. Dunyazad crater {{is a prime example of}} a viscously relaxed crater on Enceladus, with a prominent domed floor.|$|E
