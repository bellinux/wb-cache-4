On <b>the</b> condition that the mining depth of summarized SLW faces are approximately equal to each other, <b>the</b> <b>limit</b> angle decreases with the reduction of the ratio (H/M), thus the subsidence basin is relatively larger.|$|R

5|$|The Moon's {{appearance}} is considerably more complex. Its motion, like the Sun, is between two limits — known as lunistices rather than solstices. However, its travel between lunistices is considerably faster. It takes a sidereal month to complete its cycle {{rather than the}} year-long trek of the Sun. This is further complicated as the lunistices marking <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> of the Moon's movement move on an 18.6 year cycle. For slightly over nine years the extreme limits of the moon are outside the range of sunrise. For the remaining half of the cycle the Moon never exceeds <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> {{of the range of}} sunrise. However, much lunar observation was concerned with the phase of the Moon. The cycle from one New Moon to the next runs on an entirely different cycle, the Synodic month. Thus when examining sites for lunar significance the data can appear sparse due the extremely variable nature of the moon. See Moon for more details.|$|E

Starting in 1960, a {{substantial}} {{decline in the}} rate of growth compared to Bergen County occurred as Teaneck reached <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> of developable land, and the township neared its peak population. Population growth in the 1970 Census was small, but positive, with Teaneck reaching its historical maximum of 42,355. Absolute declines in population followed in both the 1980 (−7.9%) and 1990 (−3.0%) data. The 2000 Census showed recovery in Teaneck's population to 39,260, though growth (3.8%) was smaller than in Bergen County overall (7.1%).|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper <b>the</b> low density <b>limit</b> of <b>the</b> non-chronological multitime {{correlation}} functions of boson number type operators is investigated.

The independent in <b>the</b> <b>limit</b> subalgebras are found and <b>the</b> <b>limiting</b> statistics is investigated. In particular, {{it is found that}} the cumulants of certain elements coincide in <b>the</b> <b>limit</b> with <b>the</b> cumulants of the Poisson distribution.
