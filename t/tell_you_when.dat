[...] He followed that up at 10:49 by reporting that, [...] "We have a report now that a large plane crashed this morning, north of the Somerset County Airport, which is in western Pennsylvania, not too terribly far from Pittsburgh, about 80 miles or so, a Boeing 767 jet. Don't know whose airline it was, whose airplane it was, and we don't have any details beyond that which I have just given you." [...] In the confusion, he also erroneously reported a second hijacked plane heading for the Pentagon after the crash of the first.|$|E
500|$|Marburger {{responded to}} {{criticism}} of his support for Bush administration policies in 2004, stating [...] "No one will know my personal positions on issues as long as I am in this job. I am here {{to make sure that}} the science input to policy making is sound and that the executive branch functions properly with respect to its science and technology missions." [...] On the topic of stem cell research, he in 2004 said that stem cells [...] "offer great promise for addressing incurable diseases and afflictions. But I can’t <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>when</b> a fertilized egg becomes sacred. That’s not my job. That’s not a science issue. And so whatever I think about reproductive technology or choice, or whatever, is irrelevant to my job as a science adviser." [...] However, in February 2005, in a speech at the annual conference of the National Association of Science Writers, he stated, [...] "Intelligent design is not a scientific theory.... I don't regard intelligent design as a scientific topic". Also In 2005, he told The New York Times that [...] "global warming exists, and we have to do something about it." ...|$|E

When we were down there last time he says to me, 'I didn't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>when</b> you bought it off me, but that guitar used to be haunted'. I say, 'What are you talking about, Sherman?'. He says, 'There’s 50 solid {{citizens}} here in Como who'll tell you this guitar is haunted. It's the darnedest thing – we’d leave it over in the potato barn and we'd come back in and it would be moved. You'd put it down somewhere and the next morning you’d come back and it would have moved. When you took that guitar the ghost in the barn left'. He told me this not very long ago and I said to him, 'Sherman! Why didn't you tell me this before?' and he said, 'Well the ghost was gone – I didn't want it around here no more!'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Following the 1980 presidential election, Bush and {{his family}} moved to Miami-Dade County, Florida. [...] He took a job in real estate with Armando Codina, a 32-year-old Cuban {{immigrant}} and self-made millionaire. Codina had made a fortune in a computer business, and then formed a new company, The Codina Group, to pursue opportunities in real estate. [...] During his time with the company, Bush focused on finding tenants for commercial developments. Codina eventually made Bush his partner in a new development business, which quickly became one of South Florida's leading real estate development firms. As a partner, Bush received 40% of the firm's profits. [...] In 1983, Bush said of his move from Houston to Miami: [...] "On the personal side, my mother-in-law and sister-in-law were already living here", and on the professional side, [...] "I want to be very wealthy, and I'll be glad to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>when</b> I've accomplished that goal." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 12 June 2015, Head of Ninawa Operations Command General Najim al-Jubouri {{stated that}} the planned {{offensive}} for Mosul had begun, with Iraqi forces, along with Shi'ite Popular Mobilization Forces fighters, being deployed {{to the city of}} Baiji, on the road to Mosul. US-led Coalition warplanes were also reported to be pounding ISIL positions in Mosul. However, it was noted that {{the only one who could}} officially declare the start of the battle was the Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi, which he did not. In addition, two days earlier, The Daily Beast interviewed the general who said the date to begin the operation, [...] "may be very close but I can’t <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>when</b> exactly". When pressed he said it would take place in less than a year and that more than 30,000 soldiers would take part, which some analysts found hard to believe since the Iraqi military was still decimated and rebuilding following the successful ISIL offensive of June 2014. The news agency described the general's plan to retake the city as [...] "fantasy". Another contributing factor to the delay of the offensive was the ISIL capture of Ramadi, the provincial capital of Anbar province, in May 2015. As of late June, Iraqi General al-Jubouri said that forces were still being marshaled for an assault on Mosul, while city residents were becoming increasingly disappointed at the constant delays of the offensive.|$|E

40|$|I can {{summarize}} what I {{was taught}} about chronic pain {{in medical school}} in two sentences. Use Tylenol or SSRI (Motrin-like) medications. If the patient has cancer, you can use narcotics if you have to. It {{is no surprise then}} that pain patients flock to alternative therapists so they can get relief. Fortunately, most chronic pain can now be effectively treated! PAIN IS NOT THE ENEMY! Pain is often simply an important indicator of underlying problems that need to be taken care of. In fact, pain can be viewed as the red, flashing, and warning light on your dashboard <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> that something urgently needs attention. Because of this, although chronic pain can be devastating, it serves a critical function. It <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> need to avoid something (or some activity) or pay attention to something so that you do not cause damage to your self.
