40|$|This chapter has a {{focus on}} {{governance}} decision making during {{a number of major}} crises that Thailand has faced over the past decade which have had significant impacts on tourism. This chapter shows, through an exploratory analysis, the way in which a national government reacted and the decisions made with relevance to destination governance during a time of crisis. The chapter also describes a very useful concept for governance, particularly with relevance to tourist destination decision making. The definition refers to governance in terms of dealing with 2 ̆ 7 the ways in which decision-making power is organized and used 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 understood to include the processes and institutions responsible for decision making about tourism, notably various levels of government, as well as tourism promotion organizations, development bureaus, private sector enterprises and local community or resident groups 2 ̆ 7. The authors develop further in this chapter the concept of governance to include both exercises in power as well as workings of democracy and participation in decision making. Of particular interest, this chapter includes the effects of governance decisions relating to tourist destinations during a period of crisis. Two particular crisis situations are explored- major democratic protests in Bangkok, as well as the response and reactions to the Boxing Day 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Through this review, the authors indicate the importance of strong proactive, strategic and structured approaches to future potential crises. In addition, the chapter discusses the challenges and potential ineffectiveness of <b>tourism</b> <b>industry</b> <b>responses</b> to major crises and the importance of governance approaches (with the possibility of collaboration with industry) in dealing more effectively with large, potentially negative events...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The ethical {{principles}} that potential tourism/hospitality employees bring to this industry have, {{only in the}} last decade or so, begun to receive research scrutiny. Fundamental ethical beliefs, it is suggested, arc likely to have wideranging implications in regard to issues such as management style and workstress problem-solving, particularly in the face of perceived indifference or injustice among prospective employers and su-pervisors. Ethical beliefs accompanying prospective employees are likely to be attended by expectations re-garding the validity and efficacy of particular workstress problem-solving strategies perceived to be dis-played by <b>tourism</b> <b>industry</b> management. This study has examined four basic {{ethical principles}} that are at the core of optimal employee functioning: efficiency, reliability, Initiative and hardwork; the paper has al-so examined a range of perceived <b>tourism</b> <b>industry</b> management workstress <b>response</b> strategies among a sample of potential <b>tourism</b> <b>industry</b> employees, particularly as those perceptions may be mediated by ba-sic workplace ethical beliefs.

40|$|Since the 1970 s, in many {{developed}} countries, {{governance arrangements}} for tourism have been revised {{in response to}} significant challenges faced by national economies and the associated changing political contexts. Destination management organisations (DMOs) that have traditionally been part of public sector structures have been shifted towards {{the realm of the}} private sector and are now operated in a collaborative way, with public-private partnerships (PPPs). This paper takes a governance theory approach and examines <b>tourism</b> <b>industry</b> stakeholders’ <b>responses</b> to a proposed public-private partnership arrangement for the local destination management organisation in Jersey, a British Isle. The period under study is 2006 to 2012, a time when public sector governance arrangements for tourism were experiencing significant change in the UK context. Stakeholders acknowledged and agreed the common benefits associated with PPPs, such as greater efficiencies and expertise, but they also identified in particular the various reasons why a standard PPP model would not be appropriate for Jersey’s DMO because of the island characteristics of the destination. These stakeholders’ responses to a new PPP model are better understood by examining the relationship between governance and the concept of ‘islandness’...|$|R

50|$|Haiti, {{a nation}} that shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic, has been greatly {{affected}} by HIV. As of 2014, the adult prevalence rate of HIV {{is estimated to be}} 1.93%. For some time, Haiti had highest rate in the Americas and the highest outside of Sub-Saharan Africa. Like many other countries, the disease began as being associated with {{men who have sex with}} men, specifically men in Haiti who engaged in commercial sex with male tourists. Later, the disease crossed over into the heterosexual community, with the main areas of risk being sex with female sex workers, casual sex with partners infected with AIDS, and blood transfusions. The course of the disease in Haiti has been rapid and aggressive, compounded by high rates of tuberculosis and other diseases of poverty. Furthermore, a large number of children were born to HIV-positive mothers before proper treatment was available, leading to a spike in infant mortality. Negative affects have been observed in the country, one being the impact on the economy due to a shrinking <b>tourism</b> <b>industry.</b> The <b>response</b> of the healthcare in Haiti has been fairly effective. Due to swift identification of the disease, a coordinated response was undertaken relatively quickly. Several measures were taken, such as giving the Haitian Red Cross complete control of the blood bank, launching a national awareness campaign, and setting up local health units that provide HIV treatment with antiretroviral drugs. Although Haiti has undergone civil unrest for several years, a priority was placed on the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and strong relationships were formed with the private health sector. Through both prevention and care, Haiti continues to manage the spread of the disease.|$|R
