5|$|Arafat {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>Lebanon</b> a {{year after}} his eviction from Beirut, this time establishing himself in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli. This time Arafat was expelled by a fellow Palestinian working under Hafez al-Assad. Arafat did not return <b>to</b> <b>Lebanon</b> after his second expulsion, though many Fatah fighters did.|$|E
5|$|On the {{following}} day Huron encountered another sailing ship, the Lebanon, heading for New York. Dorian, the five passengers and twelve of the crew chose to transfer <b>to</b> <b>Lebanon.</b> The other crewmen, possibly anticipating a hostile reception in their home port, chose to remain with Huron and proceed to Quebec, where she arrived on October 13.|$|E
5|$|Aflaq {{moved to}} Baghdad {{following}} his reelection to the Secretary Generalship in February 1968. He stayed there until 1970, when Black September happened, he criticised the Ba'ath leadership of doing {{too little to}} help the Palestine Liberation Organisation during the conflict. During the conflict, Aflaq lobbied extensively for Yasser Arafat and the PLO. Aflaq wanted Iraqi intervention; al-Bakr, however, refused to get Iraq involved in such a conflict. Because of this, Aflaq returned <b>to</b> <b>Lebanon</b> in self-imposed exile. The government of Hafez al-Assad, the President of Syria, condemned Aflaq to death in absentia in 1971.|$|E

5|$|After the battle, Fatah {{began to}} engage in {{communal}} projects to achieve popular affiliation. The battle of Karameh and the subsequent increase in the PLO's strength are considered to have been important catalysts for the 1970 events {{of the civil war}} known as Black September, in which the kingdom managed to expel the Palestinian groups <b>to</b> <b>Lebanon</b> after they had started to gain control over Jordan.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, the New England states {{adopted a}} region-wide system for route numbering. New England Route 14 was {{initially}} {{designated as a}} northsouth route beginning at White River Junction, through Montpelier, {{to the city of}} Burlington. The route used modern VT 14 to Barre, then US 302 to Montpelier, and US 2 to Burlington. By 1925, an extension into New Hampshire had been designated continuing across the Connecticut River <b>to</b> <b>Lebanon,</b> New Hampshire and heading southeast to Franklin, along modern US 4 to Andover and New Hampshire Route 11 to Franklin.|$|E
5|$|In May 1943 the LRDG {{was sent}} <b>to</b> <b>Lebanon</b> to retrain in {{mountain}} warfare. However, following the Italian armistice in 1943, {{they were sent}} to Leros, one of the Dodecanese islands, to serve as normal infantry. They later {{took part in the}} Battle of Leros, where the commanding officer John Richard Easonsmith was killed and replaced by David Lloyd Owen. After the battle the last New Zealanders, two officers and approximately 46 men, were withdrawn from the LRDG and returned to their division.|$|E

5|$|Aflaq {{at first}} {{extended}} his {{support to the}} new government, believing {{that he and the}} Ba'ath Party could collaborate with Shishakli because they shared the same Arab nationalist sentiments. His analysis of Shishakli proved to be wrong, and one of Shishakli's first decisions as ruler was to ban all political parties, including the Ba'ath Party. The Ba'ath Party leadership, and several leading members, escaped <b>to</b> <b>Lebanon</b> in the wake of increased government repression. In Lebanon Aflaq and al-Bitar agreed to a merger of the Arab Ba'ath Party and the Arab Socialist Party (ASP), led by Akram al-Hawrani, to establish the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party in 1952. The newly formed party worked as a base of operation against Shishali's rule – Aflaq and the rest cooperated with non-Ba'athist opposition forces too. Shishakli was toppled in February 1954.|$|E
5|$|At the 66th Venice International Film Festival, Sylvie Olivé {{was awarded}} the Golden Osella for Outstanding Technical Contribution and the film {{received}} the Biografilm Lancia Award.

Kurt Halfyard, a film critic for Twitch Film, listed Van Dormael's film among the best science fiction films of the 21st century. The American Film Institute listed Mr. Nobody as one of the best European films of 2010.|$|E
5|$|Just beyond East Norwood, the Pennsylvania built McCullough Yard in 1927, {{improving}} switching {{operations for}} the growing industrial base in Norwood. A connection was included to the Pennsylvania's Chicago-bound Richmond Branch, which the CL crossed over north of the yard. In Butler County, north of Brecon, the CL curved abruptly northeast onto the original line, partially graded in the 1850s between Sharonville and Lebanon. Just beyond, it began to descend slowly through Mason to Hageman, where it crossed the Middletown Branch, and then rose slightly, alongside Turtle Creek, <b>to</b> <b>Lebanon.</b> The Pennsylvania tore down the original Lebanon passenger station in 1960, replacing it (for freight purposes) with a smaller building from Kings Mills on the Little Miami Railroad. The Lebanon Council of Garden Clubs acquired the land in 1972, tore down the freight depot, and erected {{a replica of the}} old passenger depot in its place, with a gift shop inside.|$|E

Shortly afterward, the family moved <b>to</b> <b>Lebanon,</b> Pennsylvania, where Keeler {{attended}} St. Mary School and Lebanon Catholic High School. Keeler was one of five children. Keeler's mother was a schoolteacher and {{the daughter of an}} Illinois farmer. She married his father, a steel-casting salesman, in 1930. Keeler {{was a member of the}} Boy Scouts of America and achieved the rank of Eagle Scout. Keeler received a BA from St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania, in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Nobody has {{received}} accolades in categories ranging from {{recognition of the}} film itself, to its cinematography, direction and editing, to the cast's performance, particularly Jared Leto's portrayal of the film's protagonist, Nemo Nobody. The film was submitted for consideration for the Golden Lion at the 66th Venice International Film Festival, but lost <b>to</b> <b>Lebanon</b> (2009). Sylvie Olivé was later given the Golden Osella for Outstanding Technical Contribution for the production design while the film received the Biografilm Lancia Award. Jared Leto earned a nomination for the Volpi Cup for Best Actor. He was also awarded at the 14th Puchon Film Awards.|$|E
5|$|Arafat {{was born}} to Palestinian parents in Cairo, Egypt, where {{he spent most of}} his youth and studied at the University of King Fuad I. While a student, he embraced Arab {{nationalist}} and anti-Zionist ideas. Opposed to the 1948 creation of the State of Israel, he fought alongside the Muslim Brotherhood during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Returning to Cairo, he served as president of the General Union of Palestinian Students from 1952 to 1956. In the latter part of the 1950s he co-founded Fatah, a paramilitary organisation seeking the disestablishment of Israel and its replacement with a Palestinian state. Fatah operated within several Arab countries, from where it launched attacks on Israeli targets. In the latter part of the 1960s Arafat's profile grew; in 1967 he joined the PLO and in 1969 was elected chair of the Palestinian National Council (PNC). Fatah's growing presence in Jordan resulted in military clashes with King Hussein's Jordanian government and in the early 1970s it relocated <b>to</b> <b>Lebanon.</b> There, Fatah assisted the Lebanese National Movement during the Lebanese Civil War and continued its attacks on Israel, resulting in it becoming a major target of Israel's 1978 and 1982 invasions.|$|E

5|$|In January 1953, {{the unit}} {{deployed}} to the Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay on Oahu {{for six months}} of training, after which 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines returned to Pendleton. In August 1953, 3rd Battalion deployed to Japan for training operations at Kin Beach, Okinawa and Iwo Jima. In October 1956, 3rd Battalion was stationed in Japan when the Suez Crisis broke out. Though initially deployed to the Indian Ocean for possible action in Egypt and the surrounding region, the crisis was ultimately resolved. During this cruise, 3rd Battalion—designated Battalion Landing Team (BLT) 3/3 – visited Brunei Bay, Bombay, Karachi, and Singapore, before returning to Japan. In December 1956, the entire 3rd Marine Regiment was deployed off of Indonesia because of civil strife in that country. In 1958, 3rd Battalion was alerted for possible deployment <b>to</b> <b>Lebanon,</b> but its transports were turned back in the Indian Ocean to Okinawa. Four years later, in 1962, the battalion deployed on the USS Bayfield to the Chinese coast to guard the Taiwanese islands of Quemoy Matsu.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Hananu logistically {{supported}} the guerrilla operations of Barakat against the French in the Antioch region. He later decided {{to organize a}} rebellion in Aleppo and its countryside. Hananu was motivated to act {{by what he saw}} as the ineffectiveness of the Syrian National Congress, the legislative body of Faisal's state of which Hananu was a member, in preventing French rule. He may also have been encouraged by Rashid al-Tali'a, the Arab government's district governor of Hama, who had been supporting Saleh al-Ali and the Alawite-dominated revolt he was leading against the French in the Syrian coastal mountains. Meanwhile, the Syrian National Congress proclaimed the establishment of the Arab Kingdom of Syria in March 1920. France was wary that a popular nationalist movement emanating from Faisal's kingdom could spread <b>to</b> <b>Lebanon</b> and French territories in North Africa, and moved {{to put an end to}} Faisal's state. Anti-French resistance manifested at local level as the Committees of National Defense, which began springing up in Aleppo and its hinterland. The committees were founded by members of the local elite, many of whom were sympathetic to Ottoman rule, but the committees quickly became fueled by populist agitation against French colonialism.|$|E
5|$|Most {{populations are}} resident, but the {{northern}} and eastern populations are more migratory, relocating to wintering areas between September and November and returning between February and early May. Their range expands northwards into Russia to Siberia during summer, and retracts in winter. They are vagrants to the Faroe Islands, particularly {{in the winter and}} spring, and occasionally to Iceland. Elsewhere, western jackdaws congregate over winter in the Ural Valley in north-western Kazakhstan, the north Caspian, and the Tian Shan region of western China. They are winter visitors to the Quetta Valley in western Pakistan, and are winter vagrants <b>to</b> <b>Lebanon,</b> where they were first recorded in 1962. In Syria, they are winter vagrants and rare residents with some confirmed breeding taking place. The soemmerringii subspecies occurs in south-central Siberia and extreme north-west China and is accidental to Hokkaido, Japan. A small number of western jackdaws reached the north-east of North America in the 1980s and have been found from Atlantic Canada to Pennsylvania. They have also occurred as vagrants in Gibraltar, Mauritania, and Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and one is reported to have been seen in Egypt.|$|E

5|$|On 20 August 1948, the Jewish National Fund {{called for}} {{building}} a settlement on some of al-Birwa's lands, and on 6 January 1949, Yas'ur, a kibbutz, was established there. In 1950, the moshav of Ahihud was inaugurated on the village's western lands. According to Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, one of al-Birwa's schools, two shrines for local sages, and three houses remained standing as of 1982. One of the shrines was domed and built of stone. Most of the structures stood amid cacti, weeds, olive and fig groves, and mulberry trees. Most of al-Birwa's inhabitants fled to nearby Arab towns and villages, including Tamra, Kabul, Jadeidi-Makr, Kafr Yasif, and other localities. Some fled <b>to</b> <b>Lebanon,</b> {{and ended up in}} the Shatila refugee camp, in the outskirts of Beirut, where Palestinian historian Nafez Nazzal interviewed them in 1973. Among the refugees of al-Birwa was Mahmoud Darwish, who was born in the village in 1941 and lived part of his childhood there.|$|E
5|$|The Arab Ba'ath Party {{merged with}} Akram al-Hawrani's Arab Socialist Party to {{establish}} the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party in 1952; Aflaq was elected the party's leader in 1954. During the mid-to-late 1950s the party began developing relations with Gamal Abdel Nasser, the President of Egypt, which {{eventually led to the}} establishment of the United Arab Republic (UAR). Nasser forced Aflaq to dissolve the party, which he did, but without consulting with party members. Shortly after the UAR's dissolution, Aflaq was reelected as Secretary General of the National Command of the Ba'ath Party. Following the 8th of March Revolution, Aflaq's position within the party was weakened {{to such an extent that}} he was forced to resign as the party's leader in 1965. Aflaq was ousted during the 1966 Syrian coup d'état, which led to a schism within the Ba'ath Party. He escaped <b>to</b> <b>Lebanon,</b> but later went to Iraq. In 1968 Aflaq was elected Secretary General of the Iraqi-led Ba'ath Party; during his tenure he held no de facto power. He held the post until his death on 23 June 1989.|$|E
