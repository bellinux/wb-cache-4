5|$|Weeding rakes: As weeding was a {{constant}} issue in the ancient and medieval Chinese agricultural process, it led to <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weeding rake. <b>The</b> <b>invention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chinese weed rake is derived from <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chinese harrow. In the Chinese agricultural text Qimin Yaoshu written by the Northern Wei Dynasty official Jia Sixie. Harrows were originally called iron-teeth rakes due to its shaping. According to it's shape, the Chinese harrow was divided into three sub-classifications: Strip rake, Y-shaped rake, and square rake. The harrows seen in the murals of the Wei and Jin Dynasties are strip rakes.|$|E
5|$|In Chile, folklorist Oreste Plath {{attributed}} <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{drink to}} Elliot Stubb, an English steward {{of a ship}} named Sunshine, who allegedly mixed Key lime juice, syrup, and ice cubes to create the cocktail in a bar, in 1872, in {{the port city of}} Iquique, which at that time was part of Peru. Regardless, the original source cited by Plath attributed to Stubb <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whiskey sour—not the pisco sour. The oldest known mentions of the pisco sour are from a 1921 magazine attributing Morris as the inventor and a 1924 advertisement for Morris' Bar published in a newspaper from the port of Valparaíso, Chile.|$|E
5|$|In Thomas Deloney's novel Thomas of Reading (1600) <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Halifax Gibbet is {{attributed}} to a friar, who proposed the device {{as a solution to}} the difficulty of finding local residents willing to act as hangmen.|$|E

25|$|Great art is <b>the</b> outward {{expression}} <b>of</b> {{an inner}} {{life in the}} artist, and this inner life will result in his personal vision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. No amount <b>of</b> skillful <b>invention</b> can replace <b>the</b> essential element <b>of</b> imagination. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weaknesses <b>of</b> much abstract painting is the attempt to substitute <b>the</b> <b>inventions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human intellect for a private imaginative conception.|$|R
25|$|Quantum optics gained {{practical}} importance with <b>the</b> <b>inventions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maser in 1953 and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laser in 1960. Following <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> Paul Dirac {{in quantum}} field theory, George Sudarshan, Roy J.

5|$|The Bronze Age (3200–1200 BCE) saw {{the birth}} of Lebanon's first {{fortified}} villages, the development of commercial and maritime activities and <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world's first alphabet in Byblos. This collection includes the Museum's masterpiece: the sarcophagus of Ahiram, which holds the oldest text written in the Phoenician alphabet.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>invention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greek alphabet, {{as opposed}} to all {{previous}} systems, including the Phoenician, constituted an event {{in the history of}} human culture, the importance of which has not as yet been fully grasped.

5|$|Drug use and overdoses {{increased}} {{significantly in the}} 1800s due to the commercialization and availability of certain drugs. For example, while opium and coca had been used for centuries, their active ingredients, morphine and the cocaine alkaloid, were not isolated until 1803 and 1855 respectively. Cocaine and various opiates were subsequently mass-produced and sold openly and legally in the Western world, resulting in widespread misuse and addiction. Drug use and addiction also {{increased significantly}} following <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hypodermic syringe in 1853, with overdose being {{a leading cause of}} death among intravenous drug users.|$|E
5|$|Eighteenth century {{scientific}} laboratories usually contained {{some form}} of hand-operated electrostatic machine. Italian scientist Luigi Galvani had an electrostatic generator in his laboratory, where experiments with frog legs led {{to the discovery of}} animal electricity. Another Italian scientist, Alessandro Volta, disagreed with some of Galvani's ideas, and this scientific argument motivated Volta to develop the first frog-free galvanic cell, and led directly to <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first practical electric battery, the voltaic pile.|$|E
5|$|Electronic cigarette: Hon Lik, a Chinese pharmacist, is {{credited}} with <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern electronic cigarette. In 2003, {{he came up with}} the idea of using a piezoelectric ultrasound-emitting element to vaporise a pressurized jet of liquid containing nicotine diluted in a propylene glycol solution.This design produces a smoke-like vapour that can be inhaled and provides a vehicle for nicotine delivery into the bloodstream via the lungs. He also proposed using propylene glycol to dilute nicotine and placing it in a disposable plastic cartridge which serves as a liquid reservoir and mouthpiece.|$|E
25|$|Others have objected that <b>the</b> {{language}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speeches is too Lukan {{in style}} to reflect anyone else's words. Moreover, George Shillington writes that <b>the</b> author <b>of</b> Acts most likely created the speeches accordingly and they bear his literary and theological marks. Conversely, Howard Marshall {{writes that the}} speeches were not entirely <b>the</b> <b>inventions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> author and while {{they may not be}} accurate word-for-word, the author nevertheless records <b>the</b> general idea <b>of</b> them.|$|R

5|$|Even {{after the}} chariot had become {{obsolete}} {{as a tool}} of war, there still was a need for technological innovations in pulling technologies; horses were needed to pull heavy loads of supplies and weapons. <b>The</b> <b>invention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horse collar in China during the 5th century AD (Southern and Northern Dynasties) allowed horses to pull greater weight than they could when hitched to a vehicle with the ox yokes or breast collars used in earlier times. The horse collar arrived in Europe during the 9th century, and became widespread by the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|In Europe the Renaissance of the 14th17th centuries heralded a {{scientific}} revival during which botany gradually emerged from natural history {{as an independent}} science, distinct from medicine and agriculture. Herbals were replaced by floras: books that described the native plants of local regions. <b>The</b> <b>invention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> microscope stimulated the study of plant anatomy, and the first carefully designed experiments in plant physiology were performed. With the expansion of trade and exploration beyond Europe, the many new plants being discovered were subjected to an increasingly rigorous process of naming, description, and classification.|$|E
5|$|In the 12th and 13th centuries, Europe {{produced}} {{economic growth}} and innovations in methods of production. Major technological advances included <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> windmill, the first mechanical clocks, the manufacture of distilled spirits, {{and the use of}} the astrolabe. Concave spectacles were invented around 1286 by an unknown Italian artisan, probably working in or near Pisa.|$|E

His father was George Henry Strutt {{and his mother was}} Agnes (born Ashton). He was the youngest child and only son. His two elder sisters were Susan Agnes and Lucy Frances Strutt. A third sister, Clara, was born in 1861 but died in 1863.|$|R
50|$|IBM Research's {{numerous}} {{contributions to}} physical and computer sciences include the Scanning Tunneling Microscope and high temperature superconductivity, {{both of which}} were awarded the Nobel Prize.
