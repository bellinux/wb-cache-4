As experienced by other European volume car makers, Peugeot's United States and Canadian sales faltered and finally became uneconomical, as the Peugeot 505 design aged. For a <b>time,</b> <b>distribution</b> in the Canadian market was handled by Chrysler. Several ideas to turn around sales in the United States, such as including the Peugeot 205 in its lineup, were considered but not pursued. In the early 1990s, the newly introduced 405 proved uncompetitive with domestic and import models in the same market segment, and sold less than 1,000 units. Total sales fell to 4,261 units in 1990 and 2,240 through July 1991, which caused the company to cease its U.S. and Canada operations after 33 years.|$|E

His very successful and profitable time sales to the Pennsylvania Railroad stood out among the many non-government based observatories of the day who were largely subsidizing their researches by time-service sales to regional railroads and the cities they served. The United States Naval Observatory's increasing dominance in this field threatened these regional observatories' livelihoods and Langley became a leader in efforts to preserve the viability of their commercial programs.|$|E

40|$|Travel <b>time</b> <b>distributions</b> {{are often}} used to {{characterize}} catchment discharge behavior, catchment vulnerability to pollution and pollutant loads from catchments to downstream waters. However, these <b>distributions</b> vary with <b>time</b> because they are a function of rainfall and evapotranspiration. It is important to account for these variations when the time scale of interest is smaller than the typical time-scale over which average travel <b>time</b> <b>distributions</b> can be derived. Recent {{studies have suggested that}} subsurface mixing controls how rainfall and evapotranspiration affect the variability in travel <b>time</b> <b>distributions</b> of discharge. To quantify this relation between subsurface mixing and dynamics of travel <b>time</b> <b>distributions,</b> we propose a new transformation of travel time that yields transformed travel <b>time</b> <b>distributions,</b> which we call Storage Outflow Probability (STOP) functions. STOP functions quantify the probability for water parcels in storage to leave a catchment via discharge or evapotranspiration. We show that this is equal to quantifying mixing within a catchment. Compared to the similar Age function introduced by Botter et al. (2011), we show that STOP functions are more constant in time, have a clearer physical meaning and are easier to parameterize. Catchment-scale STOP functions can be approximated by a two-parameter beta distribution. One parameter quantifies the catchment preference for discharging young water; the other parameter quantifies the preference for discharging old water from storage. Because of this simple parameterization, the STOP function is an innovative tool to explore the effects of catchment mixing behavior, seasonality and climate change on travel <b>time</b> <b>distributions</b> and the related catchment vulnerability to pollution spreading...|$|R
