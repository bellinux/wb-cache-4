5|$|The brigade {{returned}} to Germany {{after the operation}} was complete. Throughout 1998–2002 it would train with German engineers, including German units from Lahnstein and Speyer, {{as well as the}} German Engineering School. The brigade also set up marksman competitions with German units, <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>US</b> soldiers the chance to earn the German Armed Forces Badge of Marksmanship, the German Sports Badge, and other badges. Over 2,500 of these badges would be earned by soldiers of the 130th over the years that it served in Germany. It also trained extensively in bridging operations at rivers throughout Germany. In summer of 2000, the brigade participated in a joint engineering exercise in Moldova with US Navy Seabees and the 505th Engineer Brigade of the North Carolina Army National Guard. The exercise was the first ever conducted in Moldova and featured numerous training scenarios as well as the construction of a medical clinic. Several other such exercises were conducted in nations throughout Europe including Albania, Romania, Georgia, Latvia, Bulgaria and Macedonia. They also performed annual humanitarian missions to Poland, working on community projects around the country with the assistance of Polish Armed Forces every September, as a training exercise.|$|E

Enough survives <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> access to women's historical experiences, and reveals some vivacious and powerful figures, {{such as the}} Sufi mystic Raabi'a al-Adwiyya (714–801 CE), the princess and poet 'Ulayya bint al-Mahdi (777–825 CE), and the singing-girls Shāriyah (-70 CE), Fadl Ashsha'ira (d. 871 CE) and Arib al-Ma'muniyya (797–890 CE).|$|E
25|$|Some clay {{models of}} houses survive <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> {{an idea of}} what smaller {{dwellings}} were like. One depicts a round hut with a conical roof thatched in layers, while another depicts a rectangular house with rectangular doors and windows, a roof supported by beams that end in 'monkey heads', and a parapet and water spout on the roof. Both were found in Hawelti. Another depicts a square house with what appear to be layers of pitched thatch forming the roof.|$|E

25|$|Many radical {{views of}} transsaccadic memory exist. Some are favoured {{more than others}} because of the {{evidence}} that supports them. One less-accepted theory, Breitmeyer's spatiotopic fusion hypothesis, suggested that successive images are fused based on environmental coordinates and not retinal ones. In other words, our memory stores a sequence of images from our surroundings, and joins the images together <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a full representation in our brain. The orientation of our retinas do not have an influence on this form of memory. This theoretical form of memory supposedly stores highly detailed representations of the world in a high capacity spatial buffer. Research and experiments by other psychologists provide empirical evidence against these claims.|$|E
25|$|I {{returned}} to a Salonika destroyed. I was hoping to find my adopted brother, but rumor told that he had died of malaria in Lublin. I already knew that my parents had been burned on their first day at the extermination camp of Auschwitz. I was alone. Other prisoners who were with me had nobody either. These days, I am with a young man that I had known in Brussels. We do not separate from each other. We were both survivors of the camps. Shortly after, we married, two refugees who had nothing, there {{was not even a}} rabbi <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> the blessing. The director of one of the Jewish schools served as a rabbi and we married, and so I started a new life.|$|E
25|$|The {{temporary}} tariffs of 8–30% {{were originally}} scheduled {{to remain in}} effect until 2005. They were imposed <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>U.S.</b> steel makers protection from what a U.S. probe determined was a detrimental surge in steel imports. More than 30 steel makers had declared bankruptcy in recent years. Steel producers had originally sought up to a 40% tariff. Canada and Mexico were exempt from the tariffs because of penalties the United States would face under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Additionally, some developing countries such as Argentina, Thailand, and Turkey were also exempt. The typical steel tariff {{at the time was}} usually between zero and one percent, making the 8-30% rates seem exceptionally high. These rates, though, are comparable to the standard permanent U.S. tariff rates on many kinds of clothes and shoes.|$|E

25|$|The Panarion furnishes very {{valuable}} {{information concerning the}} religious history of the fourth century, either because the author confines himself to transcribing documents preserved by him alone, or because he writes down his personal observations. With regard to Hieracas (Haer., lxvii), he makes known a curious Egyptian sect by whom asceticism and intellectual work were equally esteemed. In connection with the Meletians of Egypt (Haer., lxviii), he has preserved important fragments of contemporary Egyptian history of this movement. With regard to Arianism (Haer., lxix), if he gives an apocryphal letter of Constantine, he transcribes two letters of Arius. He {{is the only one}} <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> any information concerning the Gothic sect of the Audians (Haer., lxx), as well as the Arabian sect of the Collyridians. He has made use of the lost report of the discussion between Photinus (Haer., lxxi), and Basil of Ancyra. He has transcribed a very important letter from Bishop Marcellus of Ancyra (Haer., lxxii) to Pope Julius, and fragments of the treatise of Acacius of Caesarea against Marcellus. With regard to the Semiarians (Haer., lxxiii), he gives in the Acts of the Council of Ancyra (358) a letter from Basil of Ancyra and one from George of Laodicea, and the stenographic text of a singular sermon of Melitius {{at the time of his}} installation at Antioch. In the chapter dealing with the Anomeans (Haer., lxxvi) he has preserved a monograph of Aetius.|$|E

500|$|Several {{concepts}} and items of imagery {{have been used}} in Biblical comparisons. Jor-El casts out General Zod from Krypton, a parallel to the casting out of Satan from Heaven. The spacecraft that brings Kal-El to Earth {{is in the form of}} a star (Star of Bethlehem). Kal-El comes to Jonathan and Martha Kent, who are unable to have children. Martha Kent states, [...] "All these years how we've prayed and prayed that the good Lord would see fit <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a child," [...] which was compared to the Virgin Mary.|$|E

Darwaza wrote textbooks and was an educator himself. One of his students who later became a nationalist politician, Akram Zu'aiter, wrote that Darwaza [...] "used <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a weekly lesson on the principles of Nationalism and [...] society, in a way which sharpened our thought and broadened our horizons."

[...] Hurlbut collaborated with director McG as director of photography on the 2006 film We Are Marshall. Hurlbut and McG decided to use vintage lenses and film stock from the time period to evoke a feeling of the 1970s.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times writer Michiko Kakutani wrote a more {{critical}} review, describing the opening as [...] "heavy-handed" [...] and early {{events in the}} novel as [...] "soap-opera-ish". Despite these objections, she concluded, [...] "Gradually, however, Mr. Hosseini's instinctive storytelling skills take over, mowing down the reader's objections through sheer momentum and will. He succeeds in making the emotional reality of Mariam and Laila's lives tangible to us, and by conjuring their day-to-day routines, he is able <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> {{a sense of what}} daily life was like in Kabul — both before and during the harsh reign of the Taliban."

[...] McConnell offered the pair salaries similar to what they received at the Star, {{as well as the}} opportunity for Frise to have his strip syndicated in the United States, which would supplement his income. [...] When they handed in their resignations that Christmas Eve, Hindmarsh asked them, [...] "Aren't you going <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a chance to bid?"

We let a bit of air out of the tires of the van and kept a constant 60 kilometers an hour.
