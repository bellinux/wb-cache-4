5|$|On 10 August 2013, Ian Holloway {{announced}} {{the signing of}} Chamakh on a one-year deal from Arsenal to Crystal Palace. On 24 August 2013 he scored his first Premier League goal since September 2011 and his first for Crystal Palace, in a 2–1 away defeat <b>to</b> <b>Stoke</b> City.|$|E
5|$|Although the NSR had joint {{ownership}} of the MB with the MS the NSR did not have running powers {{over the rest of}} the MS and was content to let the MS handle all traffic north of Middlewood. Finally with both the NSR and the Great Western Railway (GWR) expanding into Shropshire running rights were agreed for NSR trains to run to Hodnet and Wellington and in return GWR goods trains could run <b>to</b> <b>Stoke.</b>|$|E

5|$|On 28 August 2007, it was {{announced}} that a bid from Sunderland had been accepted by Stoke, after Higginbotham had handed a transfer request to the club. Higginbotham wrote in his autobiography that Pulis would only authorise the deal if he handed in a transfer request. Higginbotham signed a four-year deal with Sunderland the following day, moving for a £2.5million fee, possibly rising to £3million dependent on appearances. He said that the chance to play Premier League football under Roy Keane was too good to refuse. On 10 November 2007, Higginbotham scored the opening goal for Sunderland which was believed to come off his ear in a 1–1 draw with their Tyne-Wear rivals Newcastle United at the Stadium of Light. He was only a bit-part player by the start of 2008–09, and Keane allowed him to return <b>to</b> <b>Stoke</b> for the same fee that he had paid <b>to</b> <b>Stoke.</b>|$|E
5|$|Stoke City Football Club {{was formed}} in 1863 as Stoke Ramblers Football Club by former pupils of the Charterhouse School whilst they were {{apprentices}} at the North Staffordshire Railway. The club dropped the Ramblers from their name in 1878, and in 1888 they were founding members of the Football League. In 1925, the club's name was changed for the final time <b>to</b> <b>Stoke</b> City Football Club when Stoke-on-Trent was granted city status.|$|E
5|$|Having damaged {{his knee}} ligaments during the {{play-off}} semi-final, Cresswell missed {{the start of}} 2006–07, making his first appearance in Leeds' 4–0 home defeat <b>to</b> <b>Stoke</b> City on 14 October 2006. However, he sustained a knee injury in November 2006, after scoring his first goal {{of the season in}} Leeds' 3–0 home win over Colchester United on 11 November. His return from injury came as a 68th-minute substitute in a 2–1 victory at home to Crystal Palace on 10 February 2007. Cresswell scored in successive matches against Sheffield Wednesday and Luton Town in March 2007, but Leeds were eventually relegated into League One. He finished the season with four goals in 23 appearances.|$|E

5|$|His first league {{goal for}} Chelsea {{gave them a}} 2–1 win at Crystal Palace on 18 October, capping off a 19-pass move. Fàbregas also {{completed}} 123 passes, the most by any player on either side. On 10 December, with Chelsea already through to the knockout stage as group winners, Fàbregas scored an eighth-minute penalty to open a 3–1 Champions League victory over Sporting CP. Twelve days later he scored a second league goal, set up by Eden Hazard and concluding a 2–0 win away <b>to</b> <b>Stoke.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{the council}} {{announced}} that a park and ride facility would be developed next to the M32 to help alleviate congestion in the city centre. The project was expected to create 1,500 parking spaces and cost £191 million. In 2015, construction began on a bus-only junction between junctions 1 and 2, on land partly allocated to the Stapleton Allotments and near the Stoke Park estate. The project {{is part of the}} North Fringe to Hengrove MetroBus rapid transit route package, and involves creating new slip roads, a connecting route <b>to</b> <b>Stoke</b> Lane and a new bridge over the M32 to be completed by mid-2016. The bridge was lifted into place in June, which required closing the M32 to all traffic.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City's victory {{set up a}} Community Shield {{match against}} rivals Manchester United – who City had beaten in the semi-finals – after United {{clinched}} the Premier League shortly before kick-off in the Final. The FA Cup winners are usually awarded qualification for the UEFA Europa League, but because Manchester City qualified for the UEFA Champions League via their league position, the Europa League place was passed <b>to</b> <b>Stoke</b> City as runners-up. In the 2011 FA Community Shield match in August, the FA Cup winners Manchester City lost 3–2 to Manchester United after creating a 2–0 lead at half time.|$|E

Another version of this question was also independently proposed by J. -P. Ramis in 1988. We consider the case of Poincaré rank 1 only. We show (in dimension two) that generically no monodromy operator tends <b>to</b> a <b>Stokes</b> operator; on the other hand, in any dimension commutators of appropriate noninteger powers of the monodromy operators around singular points tend <b>to</b> <b>Stokes</b> operators.

5|$|On 2 November 2014, Kane came on as a second-half {{substitute}} in Tottenham's 2–1 {{win over}} Aston Villa and scored his first Premier League {{goal of the}} season to win the match in the 90th minute. A week later, Kane was selected in Spurs' starting line-up {{for the first time}} in the Premier League season, as the team lost 2–1 at home <b>to</b> <b>Stoke</b> City. He retained his place in the first XI for Spurs' 2–1 win at Hull City on 23 November, scoring the team's equalising goal. Between 14 and 26 December, Kane scored in three consecutive 2–1 wins for Tottenham, against Swansea City, Burnley and Leicester City respectively.|$|E
5|$|Stoke City {{went into}} their first FA Cup Final as underdogs {{according}} to their manager Tony Pulis, while Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini saw in-form Stoke's underdog tag as a risk for complacency from his side. There were fitness doubts over key players for both teams, Carlos Tevez for Manchester City, and Matthew Etherington for Stoke City, who suffered a hamstring tear only 17 days prior to the final, but both were able to start the match. However, Stoke City's underdog tag proved true as Mancini's Manchester City side had the better of the match, with a 59percent share of ball possession and 23 attempts on goal <b>to</b> <b>Stoke</b> City's nine, only {{one of which was}} on target.|$|E
5|$|The medals {{were handed}} out by Prime Minister David Cameron.

To celebrate their victory, Manchester City held an open-top bus parade on 23 May 2011, beginning at Manchester Town Hall and ending at the City of Manchester Stadium; it attracted a crowd of up to 100,000.|$|E

5|$|He joined Chesterfield in March 1953, {{and played}} for their youth {{team in the}} 1956 FA Youth Cup final. He made his first team debut in November 1958, and was sold to Leicester City for £7,000 in July 1959. He played in four cup finals for the club, as they were beaten in the 1961 and 1963 FA Cup finals, before winning the League Cup in 1964 and {{finishing}} as finalists in 1965. During this time he established himself as England's number one goalkeeper, and played every game of the nation's 1966 World Cup victory. Despite this success, he was dropped by Leicester and sold on <b>to</b> <b>Stoke</b> City for £50,000 in April 1967. He made one of the game's great saves to prevent a Pelé goal in the 1970 World Cup, but was absent due to illness as England were beaten by West Germany at the quarter-final stage.|$|E
5|$|He joined fellow Championship side Stoke City for a £225,000 fee in August 2006. He {{was made}} captain when Michael Duberry left in January 2007 and Stoke {{went on to}} {{narrowly}} miss out on a play-off place. With Stoke not being promoted Higginbotham again decided to hand in a transfer request to help force through a move to Sunderland. He spent one season at the Stadium of Light before returning <b>to</b> <b>Stoke</b> in 2008. He became a vital member of Tony Pulis' squad as Stoke established themselves in the Premier League. He scored the winning goal in the FA Cup quarter-final against West Ham United but missed out on both the semi-final and the final due to a knee injury. After his recovery he struggled to force his {{way back into the}} side and spent time out on loan to Nottingham Forest and Ipswich Town before joining Sheffield United on a free transfer in January 2013. After eight months at Bramall Lane, he left to join Conference Premier side Chester before ending his career with a short spell at Altrincham.|$|E
5|$|In 1990–91, County {{achieved}} promotion {{from the}} Fourth Division as runners-up. In 1992 {{he made his}} first trip to Wembley Stadium, as Stockport lost 1–0 <b>to</b> <b>Stoke</b> City in the Football League Trophy final. During the same season, Stockport also reached the Third Division play-off Final, but were defeated at Wembley. The following year, County again reached the League Trophy Final, but lost 2–1 to Port Vale. In January 1994 Gannon joined Notts County on a brief loan spell to help him overcome some personal problems. Returning to Stockport, he finished the season with his fourth trip to Wembley in two years, as County were denied promotion from the Second Division by a 2–1 defeat to Burnley. The team finally achieved promotion from the division in 1996–97 as runners-up. This promotion was built on a strong defence, of which Gannon and fellow centre-back Sean Connelly were a major part. The following season, County achieved an eighth-place finish in the First Division. He played under the management of Danny Bergara, Dave Jones, Gary Megson, and Andy Kilner.|$|E

5|$|Mills {{signed for}} Second Division club Leicester City on 2 March 1989 {{as part of}} the deal that saw Phil Turner join County for a fee of £125,000, with over two months of 1988–89 remaining. He slotted {{straight}} into the starting line-up, making his debut two days after joining in a 1–0 victory at home to Walsall. He made 13 consecutive appearances for Leicester before missing the last two matches of 1988–89, his new club finishing 15th in the Second Division. His first goal for Leicester was the only goal in a 1–0 win away <b>to</b> <b>Stoke</b> City on 25 November 1989. Other than a spell out of the team from early September to mid November 1989, Mills was a regular in the Leicester team that ranked 13th place in the Second Division in 1989–90, making 30 appearances and scoring four goals. He established himself as a popular player with the supporters, and was named the club's Player of the Year.|$|E
5|$|The club became {{owners of}} the Victoria Ground in 1919. The Butler Street stand was {{constructed}} shortly afterward, increasing the overall capacity of the ground to 50,000. Following the restart of the Football League, Stoke achieved promotion from the Second Division in the 1921–22 season under the stewardship of Arthur Shallcross, although {{this was followed by}} relegation in the 1922–23 season. Unable to prevent the club's bad form, Shallcross resigned in March 1923. Tom Mather was appointed manager later in 1923, although Stoke were unable to mount another promotion challenge. They were instead relegated from the Second Division four years later in the 1925–26 season. The club's stay in Third Division North was brief, as Stoke won the championship during their first season in that league. In 1925, Stoke-on-Trent was granted city status, and this led the club to change its name <b>to</b> <b>Stoke</b> City Football Club.|$|E
5|$|The {{profile of}} the sport reached a new high in the 1980s, {{with a number of}} athletes {{becoming}} household names (such as Carl Lewis, Sergey Bubka, Sebastian Coe, Zola Budd and Florence Griffith-Joyner). Many world records were broken in this period, and the added political element between competitors of the United States, East Germany, and the Soviet Union, in reaction to the Cold War, only served <b>to</b> <b>stoke</b> the sport's popularity. The increase in the commercial capacity of track and field was also met with developments in the application of sports science, and there were many changes to coaching methods, athlete's diet regimes, training facilities and sports equipment. This was also accompanied by an increase in the use of performance-enhancing drugs, and prominent cases, such as those of Olympic gold medallists Ben Johnson and Marion Jones, damaged the public image and marketability of the sport.|$|E
50|$|Twyman {{offered his}} {{friendship}} and continuous moral support {{and financial aid}} <b>to</b> <b>Stokes</b> and his family (even legally adopting him), who were saddled with {{the difficult task of}} caring for the virtually invalid Stokes, up until Stokes's death from a heart attack in 1970.|$|R
