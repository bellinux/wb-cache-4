5|$|In 1979 Miami University used a Penrose tiling {{executed}} in <b>terrazzo</b> {{to decorate the}} Bachelor Hall courtyard in their Department of Mathematics and Statistics.|$|E
5|$|Port Columbus {{began its}} Terminal Modernization Program in late 2012, which {{included}} new <b>terrazzo</b> flooring throughout the airport, new ceilings, new restrooms, more TSA security lanes, and new LED lighting. Construction started on Concourse A in late 2012 and was completed throughout the terminal in early 2016.|$|E
5|$|For the {{restoration}} of the Gamla stan metro station in 1998 the artist Göran Dahl furnished the walls and floors with motifs from various medieval textiles and manuscripts, including the Överhogdal tapestries and the 14th-century Nobilis humilis (Magnushymnen) from the Orkney Islands. Vädersolstavlan is prominently featured on the eastern wall just south of the platform where the <b>terrazzo</b> wall depicts the emblematic sun dog arcs interwoven with enlarged fragments of textiles.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 {{the cinema}} {{was awarded a}} £2.4 million National Lottery grant. The money {{will be used to}} restore the building, {{including}} the <b>terrazzo</b> foyer floor; build a cafe/bar so that customers no longer have to queue outside; install disabled toilets and improve accessibility; add a second screen in the basement; and make the cinema's archives available to the public.|$|E
5|$|Inside {{the public}} {{lobby of the}} {{building}} were walls and floors made of light tan Botticino marble, the latter in a <b>terrazzo</b> pattern. The rest of the building used rubber tile for flooring, colored green and brown. The printing plant attached to the office building, {{as well as the}} later additions, had simpler designs cast entirely in reinforced concrete.|$|E
5|$|Arcades of {{semi-circular}} arches {{divide the}} nave from the aisles. On {{the south side}} of the cathedral, a large chapel, built in 1911, extends three bays parallel to the aisle. This chapel provides a more intimate place of worship than the main church or its aisles. The nave has a cross vaulted ceiling with clerestory windows above the arcades. The cathedral's main neoclassical altar of translucent alabaster is a modern replacement for the original wooden gothic altar, now located in the southern side chapel. The main altar, built in Burgos, Spain, was donated by the local Ferre family. Except for the side chapel where <b>terrazzo</b> is used, the cathedral's floor is of gray and white marble design.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its closure, the stadium {{consisted}} of four separate all-seater stands; the pitch was aligned north-south, with the North Bank Stand (formerly the Laundry End) and South Stand (popularly known as the Clock End) at the ends of the field. The East and West Stands ran alongside the pitch and are two of the few examples of British football stands designed in the Art Deco style. The East Stand incorporated the club's offices and was well known for its marble halls (though the floors were actually <b>terrazzo)</b> which are often cited in media depictions of the stadium, and the facade that faces onto Avenell Road. The East Stand is considered architecturally significant enough to have been designated a Grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|The current Washington Park Lake House {{was built}} in 1929 {{replacing}} the original stick style structure constructed in 1876. It is constructed in the Spanish Revival style with terracotta, <b>terrazzo,</b> brick, and guastavino tile. The area {{in front of the}} lake house has been the site for the performance of plays by the Park Playhouse for over 20 years. A 900-seat amphitheater faces the lake house allowing for comfortable seating for the over 60,000 people who visit every year. A proposal by the city to turn the lake house into a 125-seat restaurant and 200-seat banquet hall with an expanded dock with boat, cross-country ski, and ice skate rentals failed to materialize {{due to a lack of}} interest from the private business sector.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground was}} lowered by a full {{story on the}} south and east sides of the station, exposing what had {{formerly}} been the basement to improve access for taxis and private automobiles. A marquee to shelter arriving and departing passengers spanned the seven central bays of the lower level, with a more ornate version on {{the north end of the}} pedestrian tunnel. The lower waiting room was expanded, a ticket office constructed, and a larger staircase to the main waiting room was built. The floor was covered with <b>terrazzo</b> and green marble, with white marble wainscoting on the walls. Three bays were added to the west wing for additional functional space, removing direct track access from the ramp. Cast iron streetlights with the PRR Keystone motif in their base were located around the driveway and grounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} building's interior initially {{had dark}} wood panels and {{was decorated with}} flowers, oriental rugs on the <b>terrazzo</b> floor, and tables and chairs in the Mission style. In 1959, when the library moved in, local architect and village resident William Anders Sharman planned the building's $2,000 renovation; he later became {{the first president of}} the Briarcliff Manor-Scarborough Historical Society. The station's circular ticket office was replaced by the librarian's desk, bookshelves replaced station furniture, and the baggage room became the children's section. Former library president Theodore R. Malsin dedicated the children's room in memory of his son Donald. From 1959 until 2009, the building housed a main reading room and children's room; a vestibule and second-story balcony were added in 1980.|$|E
5|$|A {{groundbreaking}} {{ceremony for}} the new city hall was held on July 29, 2004, and construction began {{under the direction of}} contractor Lease Crutcher Lewis, who built the original city hall, the following month. During construction, inaccuracies and omissions in the design and problems with demolishing parts of the building led to delays and an over-run of $19.6 million, bringing the final budget to $121 million. The new city hall opened on February 21, 2006, and received praise for its use of wood panels and the concourse's <b>terrazzo</b> flooring. The city hall's lower two floors, including the concourse, service desks, and the city council chamber, are open to the public; the remaining five floors house offices for city services. The city hall was granted an American Institute of Architects Honor Award by the Seattle chapter, as well as an Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star award for energy efficiency. The landscaped plaza was also recognized by the Canadian Society of Landscape Architects with a National Merit Award in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The James Edgar and Jean Jessop Hervey Public Library {{opened in}} 2003, {{replacing}} {{a much smaller}} public library. The new library, built by Conwell Shonkwiler & Associates, was partly funded by a donation via the San Diego Foundation from the Hervey family, who had {{close ties to the}} area. Jean Jessop Hervey in particular used to visit the old Point Loma Library every Tuesday to read with her children. The library, located at 3701 Voltaire Street, is over 25,000 square feet and holds over 80,000 books. It includes a kitchen area, a community meeting room, and outdoor sitting patios. The lower floor is the largest children's library in the City of San Diego, featuring a simulated ship, reading desks shaped like surfboards, an art space and a Story Time Zone. In connecting to the place of Point Loma, the library's architectural style features a nautical theme. There is even an operating periscope, salvaged from a U.S. Navy submarine, through which visitors can see the surrounding neighborhood. The floor in the entry lobby features a <b>terrazzo</b> map of the Point Loma Peninsula. The library holds scheduled events such as story time for children, Thursday after school movies, and arts and crafts demonstrations.|$|E
25|$|Following the renovations, {{all three}} {{terminals}} include blue <b>terrazzo</b> floors created by artists Kristin Jones and Andrew Ginzel (which won a 2002 Honor Award from The National <b>Terrazzo</b> and Mosaic Association), updated arrival/departure screens and restrooms and concessions {{are now available}} inside passenger holding areas. In May 2007, the final portion of the project (a new rental car facility and additional art fixtures) were completed.|$|E
25|$|Inside, the {{building}} has <b>terrazzo</b> floors. A large city council chamber, lit by chandeliers, on the upper floor seats 400.|$|E
25|$|The rear podium levels (B3 - G) each {{comprise}} large, {{open floor}} plans with later lightweight partitions. Window sills are black <b>terrazzo.</b>|$|E
25|$|Her {{collaborative}} public artworks {{include the}} <b>terrazzo</b> floor {{design in the}} Great Hall of the Denver Airport; an in-situ sculpture piece in Yerba Buena Gardens, San Francisco; and a mile-long sidewalk history trail in West Seattle.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} {{also won}} the Interior Design, Best of Year Merit Award in 2011, followed by The National <b>Terrazzo</b> and Mosaic Association, Port Morris Tile and Marble Corporation Craftsmanship Award in 2011 and the Contract, Public Space Interiors Award in 2012.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} process for this building was highly labor-intensive, {{as seen in}} the careful masonry, the elaborate <b>terrazzo</b> floor, and the use of parquet rather than strip flooring in the workroom and office areas. The level of craftsmanship was uniformly high in most Depression-era government construction, and the Visalia Town Center Post Office provides an excellent example of this.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} flooring was Venetian marble; it {{was replaced}} with a speckled maroon and black <b>terrazzo</b> floor {{as part of the}} renovations made in 1986; the church's walls and ceiling were painted mauve, pink, and alabaster. The original reredos (high altar) has been removed, but the sanctuary still contains religious artifacts, paintings, sculptures, stained glass windows, and other works of art.|$|E
25|$|To {{the north}} of the ticket hall is an office and service room for the station manager. Parts of the timber framing to the ticket windows are visible on its {{south-eastern}} wall. The floors are carpeted and the walls and ceiling are lined with fibrous cement sheeting. The windows are double-hung sashes with interior sills made with a <b>terrazzo</b> different from that {{on the floor in the}} ticket hall. Adjacent to these rooms to the north is the semi-enclosed waiting area. Its floor has a <b>terrazzo</b> tile pattern to match that in the ticket hall. Its southern wall is face brick, while the remainder are plastered. On each side wall, there are two banks of the same double-hung sashes as in the office, with interior <b>terrazzo</b> sills. There is also some solid timber shelving here. The seating, which lines three walls, is made with timber slats and framing on shaped concrete legs. Two timber-framed and screen-infill doors, with matching surrounds provide entry from each side of the platform. At the northernmost end of the building are the toilets, which consist of two toilet cubicles and wash areas accessed by timber doors on the south-western and north-eastern sides. Metal framed louvres open off all three exterior walls at two metre sill height. Approximately one and a half metres from the north- eastern face of the building stands a cast iron drinking fountain. A number of timber and concrete seats, the same as those used in the northern waiting room, sit against the building on its long facades.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} has a structured steel skeleton, brick walls, a flat asphalt-composition roof, and a reinforced concrete basement. The building's volumetric massing is symmetrical and {{derived from the}} neo-classical phase of Beaux-Arts architecture. The exterior includes aluminum, granite, white bronze, and plinth. The lobby is ornamented with veined marble and a <b>terrazzo</b> floor, the workroom has a maple parquet floor, and the postmaster's offices have oak floors.|$|E
25|$|The service core {{contains}} service risers {{and shared}} facilities, including lifts, a fire stair, dumb waiter for office files, tearooms, and large toilet and shower rooms. The fire stair {{in the service}} core retains original finishes, including black and white <b>terrazzo</b> stair treads and risers, black-painted metal balustrades with black plastic handrails, textured stair undersides, and vinyl tile clad walls with contrasting inset floor numerals.|$|E
25|$|Geologic Time, {{created by}} artist Michele Oka Doner, {{consists}} of over 900 bronze medallions inlaid in the <b>terrazzo</b> floor of Exhibition Hall's lobby. The images {{tell a story}} through pictures. Elements of many eras, past and present are depicted, including Wisconsin corn, Native American effigy mounds, and the state's lake and rivers. The medallions signify {{the passage of time}} and the connection between past and present.|$|E
25|$|Terminal A (previously Terminal 1) is {{the larger}} of the two concourses with 17 gates in total. All {{international}} carriers operate out of Terminal A. On June 18, 2014, a 35.6-million dollar renovation was completed for this terminal, with the most visible improvements to passengers being new <b>terrazzo</b> floors, updated food courts, and new signage. On October 15, 2014, all gates in Terminal A were renumbered in sequential order.|$|E
25|$|The Visalia Town Center Post Office, {{designed}} by Fresno-native architect William D. Coates, {{conforms to the}} standard symmetry used in most post offices of the time, but has unusually sophisticated terracotta detailing in shapes directly derivative of 1920s Art Deco motifs. Decorative dark-brown brick contrasts the light-tan brick used {{for the bulk of}} the building's walls. The interior ornamentation is lavish, and includes cast aluminum, marble, and a decorative multi-colored <b>terrazzo</b> floor.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{developers}} such as A. Alfred Taubman of Taubman Centers {{extended the}} concept further in 1980, with <b>terrazzo</b> tiles at the Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey, indoor fountains, and two levels allowing a shopper {{to make a}} circuit of all the stores. Taubman believed carpeting increased friction, slowing down customers, so it was removed. Fading daylight through glass panels was supplemented by gradually increased electric lighting, making it seem like the afternoon was lasting longer, which encouraged shoppers to linger.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} design had {{a complex of}} hipped roofs and an open belfry atop the tower. In 1927 fire destroyed the tower and severely damaged the roof. A team of architects who supervised the rebuilding changed the design to its current appearance. They also initiated major work on the interior, intended to fireproof the building. Much of this consisted of replacing structural wood with other materials. Wood flooring was replaced with <b>terrazzo,</b> staircases with marble, and doors were clad in metal. The chimneys were capped.|$|E
25|$|The public {{entry and}} double-height {{reception}} area are intact and feature {{black and white}} <b>terrazzo</b> floors, and marble-clad walls, columns, reception desk, planterbox and window sills. An original wall-mounted bronze artwork depicting the historical evolution of the wheel is retained in the entrance foyer. Within the front portico, L1 is a mezzanine level retaining original balustrades: iron near the southern glazing and battened timber above the reception area. Mounted on the end wall of the lift foyer facing the front entrance is Communications, a large artwork by Leonard Shillam.|$|E
25|$|Don Rosa's grandfather, Gioachino Rosa, {{lived in}} Maniago, a {{town at the}} foot of the Alps in Northern Italy, in the {{province}} of Pordenone. He emigrated to Kentucky, United States around 1900, established a successful tile and <b>terrazzo</b> company, then returned to Italy to marry and start a family. In 1915 just after the birth of his son Ugo Rosa, Gioachino returned to Kentucky with his wife, two daughters and two sons. Ugo Rosa grew up and was later married in Kentucky. His wife was born to a German American father and a mother with both Scottish and Irish ancestry.|$|E
25|$|The 30 foot (9 m) by 64 foot (20 m) {{rectangular}} {{building is}} composed of brick and features <b>terrazzo</b> flooring. The building is the most ornate of the commercial buildings in downtown Orangeville and is situated on the area's second highest lot. The main entrance, a large wooden, glass paneled door, is recessed and central on the symmetrical south (front) facade of the building. The original door is surrounded by sidelights and topped by a diamond patterned transom window. Flanking the central doorway on each side is a one over one window, each displaying the same diamond patterned transoms as the door.|$|E
25|$|The field house {{interior}} features <b>terrazzo</b> floors. In {{the auditorium}} are original light fixtures and the hallways feature decorative brackets. On {{the second story}} there is a marble niche for a drinking fountain. Additionally, the second floor houses two noteworthy paintings. There is a painting of Eugene Field that dates to 1941 and has the signature of its artist Joshua Holland. The other important painting is a mural that dates to the WPA time period entitled The Participation of Youth in the Realm of Fine Arts. The mural {{is believed to have}} been created by students in a Chicago Park District art class. The paintings were restored between 2001 and 2006 by the Chicago Conservation Center.|$|E
25|$|The Caesarstone factory {{commenced}} {{its operations}} in 1987, at Kibbutz Sdot Yam, replacing its <b>terrazzo</b> tile factory. The company {{was established in}} the wake of development work performed jointly by members of the kibbutz and additional parties such as Professor Moshe Narkis of the Technion. After changing the focus from sale of floor tiles to quartz surfaces and establishing itself in the domestic market, the company started to export its products to different countries around the world. In 2005, an additional production facility was opened at the Bar-Lev Industrial Park. In 2006, TENE Investment Fund invested 25 million dollars in exchange for 21.7% control in the company, which led to the adding of another production line at the Bar-Lev facility.|$|E
25|$|The tower levels (L1 - L9) each {{comprise}} long, {{open floor}} plans with later lightweight partitions. Window sills are black <b>terrazzo.</b> Small services cores bookend each floor, {{on the east}} and west sides of the tower. These contain fire stairs, service risers, store rooms, and kitchenettes. Some levels retain original black bean veneer fire doors. The top level of the tower (L10) contains two large auditoriums. The larger of the two, named the Charles Barton Auditorium, is double-height and has a raised stage with a proscenium arch, velvet curtains, wings spaces either side, and a backstage area with changing rooms. Under the stage is a storage area accessed via original, battened timber doors. The auditoriums are serviced by a single projection room on a mezzanine between the rooms, accessed via a narrow timber stair.|$|E
25|$|As student {{enrollment}} continued to grow, another renovation project was planned {{to increase the}} capacity of the high school while updating the facilities to better meet students' needs. The two-year project began in 1995 and required the ninth grade students to remain in their respective middle schools another year. Students in grades 10-12 occupied half of the high school while the other half was being renovated. Staff and students then picked up and moved all books, furniture and equipment into the renovated half of the building in 1996, and construction began on the other half. The $30 million renovation project connected the former ninth grade building and the high school. New construction took place over the former parking tiers with a new cafeteria (seating capacity of 600), gymnasium (capacity of 2000), library/media center, and enclosed walkway. All classrooms were reconfigured with additional classrooms located in the former library and cafeteria. The familiar curving hallways remained, but new <b>terrazzo</b> floors, ceiling tiles, and freshly painted lockers were added. Along with updated lab facilities, technology was a huge part of the project, as over 500 computers were added throughout the building.|$|E
25|$|A {{souvenir}} brochure {{produced for}} the opening night contained details of all companies and contractors involved in building and fitting out the Astoria. Edward Albert Stone was the architect, Griggs & Son Ltd of Westminster were the main building contractors, Major C.H. Bell acted as consultant engineer and local firm H. Lasenby Bros. were contracted to demolish and clear the site. The main concrete structure of the building was supplied by British Reinforced Concrete Engineering Co. Ltd of Stafford. The cast stone façade was produced by the Patent Impervious Stone and Construction Co Ltd of Leyton. Another London firm, Dawnay & Sons Ltd, provided the steelwork, but the brickwork was produced locally by the Sussex Brick Co. Ltd of Horsham. Tiling company Ramsdens of Westminster {{were responsible for the}} <b>terrazzo</b> floors and wall decoration, and the plasterwork was by H.E. Gaze Ltd of London. Two other London firms, the Carrier Engineering Co. Ltd and Berkeley Electrical Engineering Co. Ltd, respectively supplied ventilation and heating equipment and installed the electric systems and lighting. Furnishings were by W.W. Turner & Co. Ltd of Birmingham, and Henri & Laverdet Ltd (the firm of Marc-Henri Levy and Gaston Laverdet) were the interior designers. The John Compton Organ Co. of Acton installed the organ. Several other national and local firms supplied other products and services, from projectors to ticket machines.|$|E
25|$|The wide stairs {{leading from}} the subway land in the {{southern}} third of the building at a ticket hall and waiting area, which is open on both sides. A painted steel mid-rail runs the length of these stairs. Opposite the stair void the gaps between the piers are filled with screens made with a metal frame and grill panel bolted to the brick surrounds and resting on low brick walls. The internal faces of the piers are rendered and painted. The ticket windows are directly opposite the stair landing. Only the western one is currently in use, the other now hidden behind a freestanding automatic ticket machine. A number of timetable wall-boxes line the available wall space, one being an early timber example. One of the original chrome-plated ticket rails {{in front of the}} operating ticket window remains. The floor is lined with a chequered pattern of black and white <b>terrazzo</b> tiles, while the ceiling is made with fibrous cement sheeting. A stainless steel downpipe marks {{the top of the stairs}} and the endpoint of the middle handrail. There were four downpipes in the original design, one next to what had been the telephone box on the south-eastern facade, another between the office and store and another between the toilet and waiting area. How many still exist is unknown as three were enclosed in various walls along the centreline of the building and cannot be viewed. It is likely that some if not all remain.|$|E
