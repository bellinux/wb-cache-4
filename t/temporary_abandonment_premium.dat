50|$|The wreck {{was one of}} many on Gilbert's {{expedition}} {{which ended}} up with Gilbert himself being drowned in a later wreck (The one of Squirrel). The disaster contributed to the <b>temporary</b> <b>abandonment</b> of the English settlement in Newfoundland.|$|R
50|$|During the American Revolutionary War, Walter Butler, a New York Loyalist, led a mixed {{force of}} Indians and Loyalists to the area, {{resulting}} in the Cherry Valley Massacre, during which more than 40 {{people were killed and}} many were captured. This massacre was followed by a second raid in 1780, leading to the <b>temporary</b> <b>abandonment</b> of the village.|$|R
25|$|Burial 49, {{which dates}} to AD 750, {{indicates}} {{a marriage of}} the Lady Twelve Guacamaya from Topoxte with a prince from Tikal. In the Terminal Classic, immediately prior to the <b>temporary</b> <b>abandonment</b> of the site, the ceramic style of Topoxte was {{very similar to the}} ceramics of Tikal and Uaxactun. At this time, Topoxte {{was a part of the}} Yaxha polity.|$|R
50|$|Many {{people in}} modern times do not relate the holiday at all with religion, but its date is still set {{before the start of}} the Christian season of Lent. Also the core of the modern Carnaval has {{maintained}} its socially critical function by role reversal and <b>temporary</b> <b>abandonment</b> of social norms. The first day of Carnaval is six weeks before Easter Sunday. Carnaval officially begins on Sunday and lasts three days.|$|R
5000|$|War {{conditions}} have prompted the opinion in certain official quarters {{that it would}} be unwise to proceed with the construction of the loop until after the war. High costs of materials and the difficulty in obtaining deliveries are cited as arguments in favor of the <b>temporary</b> <b>abandonment</b> of the project.

5000|$|Sometime in the 2nd century AD, the Vallum was [...] "slighted"â€”that is, the ramparts {{were broken}} through and the ditch filled in at fairly regular {{intervals}} along its length. Archaeologists and historians {{have speculated that}} either the Vallum was then deemed unnecessary, or that it was {{proving to be a}} hindrance to military and authorised civilian traffic. Some have suggested that this coincided with the building of the Antonine Wall in Scotland and the <b>temporary</b> <b>abandonment</b> of Hadrian's Wall.|$|R
5|$|The project faced {{multiple}} hurdles, which forced its <b>temporary</b> <b>abandonment.</b> The political {{tensions and}} communal rioting surrounding India's 1947 partition and independence stalled production. Shortly after partition, Shiraz Ali migrated to Pakistan, leaving Asif without a financier. The actor Chandra Mohan {{suffered a heart}} attack and died in 1949. Shiraz Ali had previously suggested that business tycoon Shapoorji Pallonji could finance the film. Although Pallonji knew nothing about film production, in 1950 he agreed to produce the film because of his interest in the history of Akbar. Production was then restarted with a new cast.|$|R
5000|$|The word 'Pyecombe' {{is thought}} to derive from the Saxon name [...] "peac cumb" [...] which means 'the peak valley'. Actually the parish of Pyecombe {{comprises}} two settlements, one called 'Pyecombe' and the other 'Pyecombe Street'. These are {{about a quarter of}} a mile apart. The reason for the gap between the two parts of the village is unsure but it is generally thought to be a consequence of plague in the 17th century which necessitated the <b>temporary</b> <b>abandonment</b> of the main settlement and its 13th century Saxo-Norman church.|$|R
25|$|The {{conclusion}} of Caravaggio also {{marked the beginning}} of a <b>temporary</b> <b>abandonment</b> of traditional narrative in Jarman's films. Frustrated by the formality of 35mm film production, and by the dependence on institutions and the resultant prolonged inactivity associated with it (which had already cost him seven years with Caravaggio, as well as derailing several long-term projects), Jarman returned to and expanded the super 8mm-based form he had previously worked in on Imagining October and The Angelic Conversation. Caravaggio was entered into the 36th Berlin International Film Festival, where it won the Silver Bear for an outstanding single achievement.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose to present the current {{migration}} patterns and consequences which they have on the economical and social life in Romania. Romania's integration in the European Union had numerous benefits, meaning that it opened gates to new jobs and to new systems of education. This paper aims to highlight the demographic, social, economical and educational effects of migration on the population of Romania. There is a social impact {{on the lives of}} migrant families, especially the <b>temporary</b> <b>abandonment</b> of minors by migrant parents, low academic achievement, early school leaving and adopting inadequately behaviors in society...|$|R

5000|$|The second Space Brothers {{release was}} [...] "Forgiven (I Feel Your Love)" [...] in November 1997. It spent {{a total of}} seven weeks in the UK chart {{over the course of}} the festive period that year. 1998 {{witnessed}} the <b>temporary</b> <b>abandonment</b> of the Space Brothers moniker, and Simmonds and Jones instead elected to focus on the output of their other sobriquets Essence, Lustral and Force Majeure. The following year saw the release of [...] "Legacy (Show Me Love)" [...] in July 1999. Featuring the vocals of Kate Cameron as well as a remix by Matt Darey, it reached number 31 in the UK chart in July 1999.|$|R
5000|$|The monastery {{was founded}} at Embsay in 1120. Led by a prior, Bolton Abbey was {{technically}} a priory, despite its name. It {{was founded in}} 1154 by the Augustinian order, {{on the banks of}} the River Wharfe. The land at Bolton, as well as other resources, were given to the order by Lady Alice de Romille of Skipton Castle in 1154. In the early 14th century Scottish raiders caused the <b>temporary</b> <b>abandonment</b> of the site and serious structural damage to the priory. [...] The seal of the priory featured the Blessed Virgin Mary and the Child and the phrase sigillum sancte Marie de Bolton.|$|R
5000|$|Australia {{decided on}} an all-pace attack {{for the second}} one-day international, trusting the bowling to Thomson, Lawson, Alderman and Ian Callen. Alan Border was the fifth bowler. Pakistan made 3-234, with Zaheer Abbas scoring 109 and Javed Miandad 61. Australia made 4-204 in response, Laird {{carrying}} his bat with 91 not out and Kim Hughes scoring 64 off 67 runs. Wisden wrote that [...] "there was almost an inevitability about Pakistan's advance to victory, despite the <b>temporary</b> <b>abandonment</b> of the antiquated scoreboard by the scorers and a stand of 117 between Laird and Hughes in 74 minutes... Laird was three hours making 91 not out when Australia desperately needed more positive strokeplay." ...|$|R
50|$|The city {{reached the}} height of its power during the Early Classic period of Mesoamerican {{chronology}} (c. AD 250-600), during which period the city expanded enormously. The city's Early Classic monuments are poorly preserved, meaning {{that the history of}} its period of maximum power is poorly understood. The influence of the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico is evident in Early Classic imagery following Teotihuacan's decisive intervention at Tikal in AD 378. At the end of the Early Classic, seismic activity caused movement of the Yaxha Fault, resulting in damage to buildings in the East Acropolis. The same earthquake appears to have caused damage across the city and at neighbouring Nakum. The earthquake may have resulted in the <b>temporary</b> <b>abandonment</b> of the East Acropolis.|$|R
50|$|Walpole {{continued}} to be an influential figure in the House of Commons. He was especially active in opposing one of the Government's more significant proposals, the Peerage Bill, which would have limited {{the power of the}} monarch to create new peerages. Walpole brought about a <b>temporary</b> <b>abandonment</b> of the bill in 1719 and the outright rejection of the bill by the House of Commons. This defeat led Lord Stanhope and Lord Sunderland to reconcile with their opponents; Walpole returned as Paymaster of the Forces and Townshend was appointed Lord President of the Council. By accepting the position of Paymaster, however, Walpole lost the favour of the Prince of Wales (the future King George II) who still harboured disdain for his father's Government.|$|R
50|$|Unlike some of {{the other}} nearby islands which were {{formerly}} marshland, Potton Island has been inhabited at least since the Neolithic era. It was home to several arable farms until it flooded in 1884, leading to its <b>temporary</b> <b>abandonment</b> and longer term use as pasture. The island was reclaimed in the 1940s but some time after being acquired by the Ministry of Defence in 1955 it reverted to pasture. It has recently been disclosed (June 2005) that Potton Island was considered by John Major's Conservative government in the 1980s or 1990s as a potential long term storage site for high level nuclear waste. Local government (Southend-on-Sea Borough Council) subsequently expressed their surprise and concern that they had not been party to any consultation on the matter.|$|R
5000|$|While {{similar in}} {{circumstance}} and casualties to the Wagon Box Fight, {{which took place}} the next day near Fort Phil Kearny, Wyoming, this engagement has not received as much attention by historians. In both cases, the soldiers' defensive positions and new arms are considered critical to their holding off the larger forces of the Powder River warriors. The Wagon Box Fight was the last major engagement of the war, but native raids continued against travelers and soldiers, the telegraph, and Union Pacific Railway, which was under construction. It was brought to an end the next year under treaty. Historian Jerome Green believes that the Hayfield Fight [...] "dramatized overall ineffectiveness of military policy in the region prior to its <b>temporary</b> <b>abandonment</b> by the federal government." ...|$|R
60|$|Every {{attempt to}} soothe her, and prevail {{on her to}} retire, was unheeded; at length they endeavoured to {{separate}} her from her father by force. The movement roused her from her <b>temporary</b> <b>abandonment.</b> With a sudden paroxysm of fury, she snatched a sword {{from one of the}} familiars. Her late pale countenance was flushed with rage, and fire flashed from her once soft and languishing eyes. The guards shrunk back with awe. There was something in this filial frenzy, this feminine tenderness wrought up to desperation, that touched even their hardened hearts. They endeavoured to pacify her, but in vain. Her eye was eager and quick, as the she-wolf's guarding her young. With one arm she pressed her father to her bosom, with the other she menaced every one that approached.|$|R
50|$|Barrio San Pedro Pescador is {{a village}} and {{municipality}} in Chaco Province in northern Argentina, {{located on the}} thin coastal levee of the ParanÃ¡ River. The town {{is located in the}} Primero de Mayo Department and reports administratively to the Colonia Benitez municipality. It occupies {{the left side of the}} Chaco end of the General Manuel Belgrano Bridge, which links the province of Chaco with the city of Corrientes. The low-lying and floodable characteristics of the right bank of the Parana River are not conducive for human settlement, San Pedro Pescador being Chaco's only urban settlement located on the main channel of this river. Paradoxically the Parana River is the main source of livelihood (fishing) and its main threat, because of the periodic floods that force <b>temporary</b> <b>abandonment</b> by its inhabitants.|$|R
30|$|With the {{solution}} proposed, {{it is possible}} to compare and quantify exposure to EDS 0 (no shear possibilitiesâ€”see TableÂ  1 above) without riser safety margin (RSM). This condition is critical, as {{in the event of an}} emergency disconnection the well would not have the fluid barrier and the BOP would be unable to isolate the well from the outside environment through the blind shear rams. This could represent a catastrophic event such as an oil spill in the ocean. This approach was developed to cover the whole drilling process, including, top hole drilling, bottom hole drilling and <b>temporary</b> <b>abandonment</b> of wells. This program (SEEDS) automates and accelerates the documentation containing recommendations, standards and schedule of well construction operations, contributing to better knowledge management. The approach also allows the use of different software adopted by Petrobras for probabilistic forecasting of well runtime.|$|R
50|$|Authorized {{abandonment}} {{refers to}} a condition wherein, at the time the Master decided to abandon ship, there was no hope or intention of returning to the stricken ship. There can be no suggestion that a mere <b>temporary</b> <b>abandonment</b> would dissolve the crew's contract of employment. The case of the Albionic (1941 70 L1.L.Rep.257) ruled that there was no express order given by the Master to abandon the ship, and therefore the crew's contracts of service were not terminated at the time when they performed the salvage service. The San Demetrio (1941 69 L1.L.Rep.5) case demonstrated a good example of an authorized abandonment of ship under the Master's authority. If the ship was properly abandoned under the orders from the master, the vessel's own crews who saved the vessel or cargo on board were entitled to claim salvage.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the recent labor migration flows and trends and {{the impacts of}} theme on Romanian economic and social life. After Romania joined the EU, the travel of Romanians inside the EU is totally free and they fructified this opportunity. There are important economic consequences of this movement. In the paper we analyze the demographic consequences, since category that emigrated for economic reasons {{in the last years}} is composed of youngsters (around 30). There are also important economic consequences on financial aspects and life quality of Romanians, since the volume of money transfers was about seven billion Euros in 2007. There is also a social impact particularly on the life of migrant families. The most problematic issue is the <b>temporary</b> <b>abandonment</b> of minors by their labor migrant parents, and that, forced authorities to get policies to monitor the situation...|$|R
5000|$|The habitations of the Natufian are semi-subterranean, {{often with}} a dry-stone foundation. The {{superstructure}} was probably made of brushwood. No traces of mudbrick have been found, which became common in the following Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA). The round houses have a diameter between three and six meters, and they contain a central round or subrectangular fireplace. In Ain Mallaha traces of postholes have been identified. [...] "Villages" [...] can cover over 1,000 square meters. Smaller settlements have been interpreted by some researchers as camps. Traces of rebuilding in almost all excavated settlements seem to point to a frequent relocation, indicating a <b>temporary</b> <b>abandonment</b> of the settlement. Settlements have been estimated to house 100-150 people, but there are three categories: small, medium, and large, ranging from 15 sq. m to 1,000 sq. m. There are no definite indications of storage facilities.|$|R
40|$|Microbial {{infection}} of eggs was originally investigated {{in terms of}} human health only. Recently, however, it was found that it can also cause early embryo mortality in birds, mainly through trans-shell infection prior to incubation. Trans-shell infection is highly dependent upon environmental conditions, egg temperature and egg properties such as shell quality and antimicrobial defences. Microbial {{infection of}} eggs is more likely to occur in synchronously incubating species as first laid eggs can be exposed for up to several days prior to full incubation. One example of a population that seems at particular risk of egg microbial infection is New Zealandâ€™s little blue penguin (Eudyptula minor) from Tiritiri Matangi Island. This bird lays two eggs on average three days apart, and is believed to begin full incubation only after the second egg has been laid. Both eggs are laid in particularly humid and soiled nests and contain only low levels of lysozyme, an important antimicrobial protein. The aims of this study were therefore to 1) obtain a first examination of the rates of shell and trans-shell microbial infection of chicken eggs in New Zealand and assess the effects of cleaning on those rates, 2) investigate the role of microbes in hatching failure of little blue penguin eggs and 3) investigate other factors affecting little blue penguin egg viability. This study revealed that shell infection in chicken eggs significantly increased with exposure and significantly decreased with cleaning; however, trans-shell infection was only marginally affected by exposure and cleaning. On Tiritiri Matangi Island, Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand, nest type, egg order and shell cleaning did not affect hatching success, suggesting that nest conditions and microbial infection prior to incubation were not a major cause of egg mortality in this population. <b>Temporary</b> <b>abandonment</b> during incubation, however, was very frequent {{in the second half of}} the breeding season and fatal to most eggs. These <b>temporary</b> <b>abandonments</b> seemed to be caused by resource limitations, an aspect that should be investigated in future studies...|$|R

2500|$|Attempts {{to resolve}} the angular {{momentum}} problem led to the <b>temporary</b> <b>abandonment</b> of the nebular hypothesis in favour {{of a return to}} [...] "two-body" [...] theories. For several decades, many astronomers preferred the tidal or near-collision hypothesis put forward by James Jeans in 1917, in which the planets were considered to have been formed due to the approach of some other star to the Sun. This near-miss would have drawn large amounts of matter out of the Sun and the other star by their mutual tidal forces, which could have then condensed into planets. However, in 1929 astronomer Harold Jeffreys countered that such a near-collision was massively unlikely. Objections to the hypothesis were also raised by the American astronomer Henry Norris Russell, who showed that it ran into problems with angular momentum for the outer planets, with the planets struggling to avoid being reabsorbed by the Sun.|$|R

50|$|A {{stroke of}} {{paralysis}} ended his life suddenly and without pain. His servant found him dead, alone, and apparently asleep, {{in his home}} in Philadelphia December 12, 1872. His body was interred in Old Saint Paul's Episcopal Church Cemetery, Philadelphia. The large sums that he had earned on the stage were judiciously and fortunately invested, and resulted in his amassing a large fortune. He had purchased, about 1850, a site {{on the banks of}} the Hudson, on which he erected a castellated structure. This estate, which he named Fonthill, he afterward sold at a large advance for a convent, which later became the College of Mount Saint Vincent. In 1855 he purchased his mansion in Philadelphia, to which he retired after his <b>temporary</b> <b>abandonment</b> of the stage. There he collected the largest dramatic library in the United States. By avoiding New York and by legal evasions he succeeded in escaping the payment of alimony to his wife, but left his estate heavily in her debt.|$|R
40|$|During the "Green Sahara" period (11, 000 to 5000 {{years before}} the present), the Sahara desert {{received}} high amounts of rainfall, supporting diverse vegetation, permanent lakes, and human populations. Our knowledge of rainfall rates and the spatiotemporal extent of wet conditions has suffered {{from a lack of}} continuous sedimentary records. We present a quantitative reconstruction of western Saharan precipitation derived from leaf wax isotopes in marine sediments. Our data indicate that the Green Sahara extended to 31 degrees N and likely ended abruptly. We find evidence for a prolonged "pause" in Green Sahara conditions 8000 years ago, coincident with a <b>temporary</b> <b>abandonment</b> of occupational sites by Neolithic humans. The rainfall rates inferred from our data are best explained by strong vegetation and dust feedbacks; without these mechanisms, climate models systematically fail to reproduce the Green Sahara. This study suggests that accurate simulations of future climate change in the Sahara and Sahel will require improvements in our ability to simulate vegetation and dust feedbacks...|$|R

50|$|The {{date of the}} eruptions {{that formed}} the 340 m was {{initially}} derived from tree-ring dates, suggesting the eruption began between the growing seasons of A.D. 1064-1065. However, more recent geologic and archaeological evidence places the eruption around A.D. 1085. The largest vent of the eruption, Sunset Crater itself, {{was the source of}} the Bonito and Kana-a lava flows that extended about 2.5 km NW and 9.6 km NE, respectively. Additional vents along a 10 km extending SE produced small spatter ramparts and a 6.4 km to the east. The Sunset Crater eruption produced a blanket of ash and lapilli covering an area of more than 2100 km2 and forced the <b>temporary</b> <b>abandonment</b> of settlements of the local Sinagua people. The volcano has partially revegetated, with pines and wildflowers. The crater is the namesake for the Sunset Crater Beardtongue (Penstemon clutei). Since the last eruption of the volcano is a recent occurrence, it is considered dormant by volcanologists.|$|R
