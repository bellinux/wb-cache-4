5|$|Silcott {{was arrested}} for Blakelock's murder on 12 October 1985, six days after the riot; he was {{interview}}ed five times over 24 hours, Det Ch Supt Melvin asking <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> Detective Inspector Maxwell Dingle taking the notes. During the first four interviews, he stayed mostly silent and refused to sign the detectives' notes, but during the fifth interview on 13 October, when Melvin said he knew Silcott had struck Blakelock with a machete or sword, his demeanour changed, according to the notes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} evening Hare took the stand to give evidence. Under {{cross-examination}} about the murder of Docherty, Hare claimed Burke had been the sole murderer and McDougal had twice been involved by bringing Docherty {{back to the house}} after she had run out; Hare stated that he had assisted Burke in the delivery of the body to Knox. Although he was asked about other murders, he was not obliged to answer the questions, as the charge related only to the death of Docherty. After Hare's questioning, his wife entered the witness box, carrying their baby daughter who was suffering from whooping cough. Margaret used the child's coughing fits as a way to give herself thinking time for some of <b>the</b> <b>questions,</b> <b>and</b> told the court that she had a very poor memory and could not remember many of the events.|$|E
5|$|The {{format of}} the Super Quiz {{differs from that of}} the other subject areas. Added in 1969, it offers a {{culminating}} championship event. The Super Quiz consisted of a forty-question multiple choice test as well as a relay round until 2013. In 2013, the multiple-choice portion was eliminated and the relay portion expanded to include six of the objective subjects. Generally referred to as the Super Quiz Relay, it is the only event viewable by the general public. The relay starts with the Varsity students, followed by the Scholastic and the Honors students. Each group is given 10 or 15 questions, depending on the format decided by the state coordinator. These questions are read aloud to the audience and are printed or projected for the competitors. After <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> answers are read, the students are allowed seven seconds to select the correct answer. The answer is checked on the spot by a judge and scores are immediately displayed to the audience.|$|E

25|$|A book-length {{study of}} the Court's work Harvard's Secret Court (St. Martin's Press, 2005) was written by William Wright. More of a popular dramatization than a history, the book recounts the Court's work in {{considerable}} detail, but also includes imagined conversations and considerable speculation. Where only the notes of an interrogation survive, the author reconstructs <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> even characterizes the tone of voice of the questioners.|$|E
25|$|There was {{a subtle}} {{difference}} between the allegations against the company and Appleton in that Appleton was suspected of breaching sections of the Act, which depended on the trade and commerce power, while Huddart Parker were suspected of breaching sections of the Act, which depended on the corporations power. Both Huddart Parker and Appleton were convicted of failing to answer <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> challenged their convictions in the High Court.|$|E
25|$|As {{the press}} was {{publishing}} allegations by former contestants of quiz rigging, NBC purchased from Barry and Enright the shows Twenty One and Tic Tac Dough, along with two new daytime entries, Concentration and a musical quiz Dough Re Mi, all of which aired on NBC, for $1 million. Eventually the truth came out, and Enright admitted to rigging the show and giving contestants <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> answers in advance.|$|E

25|$|Ramana Maharshi {{provided}} upadeśa ("spiritual instruction") {{by providing}} darshan and sitting silently together with devotees and visitors, {{but also by}} answering <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> concerns raised by those who sought him out. Many of these question-and-answer sessions have been transcribed and published by devotees, {{some of which have}} been edited by Ramana Maharshi himself. A few texts have been published which were written by Ramana Maharshi himself, or written down on his behalf and edited by him.|$|E
25|$|The book is {{separated}} into {{two or three}} parts, depending upon the edition, each part having several chapters. Part one deals with questions relating to heat such as the sources of heat {{and its effects on}} humans and animals, while Part two deals with questions relating to air, explaining why metal rusts in air, the operation of barometers and the transmission of sound. A Miscellaneous section deals with several more nebulous questions, including questions about sleep and dreaming. Within each part, the different chapters break <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> answers up into subject areas organised thematically.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} British {{version of}} the show debuted on 4 September 1998, and aired on ITV with Chris Tarrant as its host until 11 February 2014. International variants have aired in around 160 countries worldwide. The show's format is a twist on the game show genre—only one contestant plays at a time (similar to some radio quizzes), and {{the emphasis is on}} suspense rather than speed. In most versions there are no time limits to answer <b>the</b> <b>questions,</b> <b>and</b> contestants are given the question before they must decide whether to attempt an answer.|$|E
25|$|Israel {{was among}} the first {{national}} governments to set up an official blog. Under David Saranga, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs became active in adopting Web 2.0 initiatives, including an official video blog and a political blog. The Foreign Ministry also held a microblogging press conference via Twitter about its war with Hamas, with Saranga answering questions from the public in common text-messaging abbreviations during a live worldwide press conference. <b>The</b> <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> answers were later posted on IsraelPolitik, the country's official political blog.|$|E
25|$|I’m {{well aware}} that I {{sometimes}} “shoot from the hip” and speak on things about which I know very little. In this present situation, I published my personal opinions about drug addiction without knowing very much about the neuroscience behind addiction, or the addiction recovery field. Not only did I say some deeply regrettable and insensitive things, but as I’ve learned more about <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> issues at hand, I accept that I have been wrongheaded {{on a number of}} topics related to these issues. Even at 84, I’m still learning. Please bear with me, folks.|$|E

25|$|On August 11, Ethel Rosenberg {{testified before}} a grand jury. She refused to answer all <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> {{as she left the}} {{courthouse}} she was taken into custody by FBI agents. Her attorney asked the U.S. Commissioner to parole her in his custody over the weekend, so that she could make arrangements for her two young children. The request was denied. Julius and Ethel were put under pressure to incriminate others involved in the spy ring. Neither offered any further information. On August 17, the grand jury returned an indictment alleging 11 overt acts. Both Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were indicted, as were David Greenglass and Anatoli Yakovlev.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} Parliamentary hearing, Labour Party, NZ First, Green Party and Māori Party {{expressed}} {{dissatisfaction with the}} order of <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> said that the public should first be asked whether they want a change, and continue with a second referendum only if they do, or both questions compacted into one referendum, which could potentially save millions of dollars. David Seymour (ACT's representative in the Cross-Party Group) said that the planned order made sense, as the public would {{need to see the}} alternative designs before deciding on a change. Professor John Burrows, chair of the Flag Consideration Panel, agreed that familiarity with proposals is a prerequisite for a properly informed decision about them.|$|E
25|$|After {{each country}} has rehearsed, the {{delegation}} meets with the show's artistic {{director in the}} video viewing room. Here, they watch the footage of the rehearsal just performed. At this point the Head of Delegation may make known any special requirements needed for the performance, and request them from the host broadcaster. Following this meeting, the delegation hold a press conference where members of the accredited press may pose them questions. The rehearsals and press conferences are held in parallel; so one country holds its press conference, while the next one is in the auditorium rehearsing. A printed summary of <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> answers which emerge from the press conferences is produced by the host press office, and distributed to journalists' pigeon-holes.|$|E
