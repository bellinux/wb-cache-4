The model {{is based on the}} Gurson–Tvergaard–Needleman model extended to account for plastic anisotropy and viscoplasticity. The model considers damage nucleation by both hydride cracking and debonding of the interface between the Laves phase precipitates and the matrix. The damage nucleation rate due to hydride cracking is directly deduced from quantitative microstructural observations. The other model parameters are identified from several experimental tests. Finite element simulations of axial <b>tension,</b> <b>hoop</b> tension, expansion due to compression and hoop plane strain tension experiments are performed to assess the model prediction capability. The calibrated model satisfactorily reproduces the effects of hydrogen and temperature on both the viscoplastic and the failure properties of the material. The results suggest that damage is anisotropic and influenced by the stress state for the non-hydrided or moderately hydrided material and becomes more isotropic for high hydrogen contents...|$|E

Preoperatively the cardiac index was reduced or the LV end-diastolic pressure was markedly increased (or both occurred) in four patients, in each of whom depression of inotropic state was docu-mented by a reduced VCF at maximum wall tension, ranging from 0. 13 to 1. 07 cir-cumferences (circ) /sec (normal,> 1. 40 circ/sec) at wall tensions of 318 to 464 g/cM 2 (normal, 178 to 417 g/cm 2).

The material performance of 15 - 15 Ti (1. 4970) thin walled fuel cladding tubes are presently being evaluated in the EERA JPNM pilot project TASTE. The TASTE objectives are to compare existing testing methodologies for claddings and to determine the tensile and creep properties of the 15 - 15 Ti (1. 4970) steel in the final product form. In this paper the small punch (SP) test technique is assessed in more detail for testing the 24 % cold worked cladding provided by SCK·CEN. The SP test results are compared with results from tensile (axial) tube tests and ring <b>tension</b> (<b>hoop)</b> tests. It is shown that the SP tensile test can produce robust estimates on the tensile strength in the temperature range from room temperature to 800 °C. The presented equation for transfering maximum force to engineering stress is shown to work for all the three test set-ups of the participating laboratories. For creep it is shown that the SP tests do not provide comparable results to internal pressure of classical creep test due to low creep ductility and premature creep cracking already at low deflections imposed at by the testing technique.

The rod is cooled by water passing through annular, which sur-rounds the active media. The temperature distribution has been used to predict numerically, the nodal displacements, strain and stress based on the principle of virtual work. The main task is to determine the temperature distribution in Nd:YAG laser rod, the subsequent value and location of maximum tensile hoop stress associated with the two types of the double end pumping for different ab-sorption power. Some conclusions are obtained; as the radius pumping ratio in-creases the location of maximum hoop stress will move toward the periphery and vice-versa. Small reduction is observed in the location of maximum hoop stress when pumping method change from the top-hat beam to Gaussian beam, espe-cially at low radius pumping ratio and high absorption power. Top hat beam end pumping will cause more intense <b>tension</b> <b>hoop</b> stress at the facets of the rod than that of Gaussian beam even the later may produce high center temperature.

40|$|In {{this paper}} free {{vibrations}} of rotating cylindrical shells with both ends free are studied. The model used {{also allows for}} considering a flexible foundation supporting the shell {{in the sense of}} a radial and circumferential distributed stiffness. Furthermore, a circumferential <b>tension</b> (<b>hoop</b> stress) which may be due to pressurisation or centrifugal forces is taken into account. Natural frequencies and mode shapes are determined exactly for both stationary shells and for shells rotating with a constant angular speed around the cylinder axis. Trigonometric functions are assumed for the circumferential mode shape profiles, and a sum of eight weighted exponential functions is assumed for the axial mode shape profiles. The functional form of the axial profiles is shown to greatly vary with the roots of a characteristic bi-quartic polynomial that occurs in the process of satisfying the equations of motion. In the previously published work it has been very often assumed that the roots are two real, two imaginary, and two pairs of complex conjugates. In the present study, a total of eight types of roots are shown to determine the whole set of mode shapes, either for stationary or for rotating shells. The results using the developed analytical model are compared with results of experimental studies and very good agreement is obtained. Also, a parametric study is carried out where effects of the elastic foundation stiffnesses and the rotation speed are examined. status: publishe...|$|E

In this test, a ring {{extracted from the}} tubes is placed over two D-shaped mandrels that are then parted {{with the aid of}} a testing machine. A detailed numerical investigation was performed to establish the validity of this test. In particular, the effect of the friction and of the radial through-thickness stresses that are induced due to the contact between the ring and the die was examined in detail. It was discovered that in a well-controlled test, these effects are comparable or lower to testing of a tube by hydraulic inflation which is a reliable method for obtaining the hoop properties of tubes. After the numerical investigation, a series of ring <b>hoop</b> <b>tension</b> tests were performed on Al- 6061 -T 4 tubes. Three-dimensional Digital image correlation (DIC) was used to capture the strain evolution in the gage section of the specimens. By comparing the hoop with the axial response, the material anisotropy of the Al- 6061 -T 4 tubes was established. As a further step, a series of notched ring <b>hoop</b> <b>tension</b> test specimens were designed and tested.

The {{results indicate that}} the initial extrusion texture {{plays an important role in}} the formation of different types of twins and that the twinning behavior also depends on the strain path. Contraction and double twinning are the dominant twinning mechanisms in uniaxial tension, while extension twinning prevails in uniaxial compression and ring <b>hoop</b> <b>tension</b> testing. Schmid factor analysis indicates that only components that are favorably oriented (i. e. with the highest SF values) can undergo rapid and complete twinning.

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Large-scale {{experiments}} on circular model cell bulkheads {{were conducted to}} define the distribution of hoop stresses, deflections of the cells, distortion of the cell fill, ultimate overturning resistance, and the critical mode of failure. The embedment depth of the model cells was varied to investigate the effect of embedment {{on the behavior of}} circular cells. The model cells were subjected to typical service loading conditions, including backfilling and backfill surcharging and were failed by application of a large lateral load. <b>Hoop</b> <b>tension</b> during initial cell filling was found to be the critical design consideration for sheetpiles along the back of the cell. Maximum interlock tension occurred within the lower third of the exposed height of the sheetpiles. An apparent coefficient of lateral earth pressure ranging from 1. 2 to 1. 6 times the active Rankine value is recommended for design of isolated cells. Maximum <b>hoop</b> <b>tension</b> and radial bulging should be assumed to occur at an elevation of one-fourth of the distance from the point of sheetpile fixity {{to the top of the}} sheetpile. The depth to fixity may be estimated by theory of elasticity and depends on the quality of the soil in which the cells are embedded. Backfilling and surcharging increased <b>hoop</b> <b>tension</b> by about 25 and 10 percent, respectively. Crest deflections vary linearly with the magnitude of backfill surcharge. Distortion of the model cells at failure indicates that circular cell bulkheads fail as flexible structures. The critical mode of failure for embedded cells was found to be that of tilting about a point of fixity. A plastic hinge forms in the front sheetpiles at the point of fixity. Failure of the cell fill occurs along roughly vertical planes which extend vertically only to the point of tilting. It is shown that the method of analysis by vertical shear using the Rankine or Krynine coefficient significantly underestimates cell overturning resistance. The method of horizontal shear overestimates the overturning resistance for embedded cells by about 35 percent. An apparent coefficient of lateral earth pressure to be used with the proposed failure model is recommended. It is shown that this coefficient depends on sheetpile embedment and fill characteristics, and is significantly larger than previously suggested values. Available field data on circular cell bulkheads, specifically <b>hoop</b> <b>tension</b> and deflection data, is presented and discussed. In general, the trends in field data compare favorably with the results from the model study...|$|R
40|$|The classic {{accepted}} {{view of the}} heliosphere is a quiescent, comet-like shape aligned in {{the direction}} of the Sun's travel through the interstellar medium (ISM) extending for 1000 's of AUs (AU: astronomical unit). Here we show, based on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, that the <b>tension</b> (<b>hoop)</b> force of the twisted magnetic field of the sun confines the solar wind plasma beyond the termination shock and drives jets to the North and South very much like astrophysical jets. These jets are deflected into the tail region by the motion of the Sun through the ISM similar to bent galactic jets moving through the intergalactic medium. The interstellar wind blows the two jets into the tail but is not strong enough to force the lobes into a single comet-like tail, as happens to some astrophysical jets (Morsony et al. 2013). Instead, the interstellar wind flows around the heliosphere and into equatorial region between the two jets. As in some astrophysical jets that are kink unstable (Porth et al. 2014) we show here that the heliospheric jets are turbulent (due to large-scale MHD instabilities and reconnection) and strongly mix the solar wind with the ISM beyond 400 AU. The resulting turbulence has important implications for particle acceleration in the heliosphere. The two-lobe structure is consistent with the energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) images of the heliotail from IBEX (McComas et al. 2013) where two lobes are visible in the North and South and the suggestion from the CASSINI (Krimigis et al. 2009, Dialynas et al. 2013) ENAs that the heliosphere is "tailless".

The influence of the height, diameter, and tensile stiffness of the cell and the width of the entire mattress on the pressure-settlement response of footing, surface deformation during footing settlement, and mobilization of <b>hoop</b> <b>tension</b> in the cell walls are illustrated. Results from the numerical analyses indicate an improvement in footing capacity of approximately 1. 4 times greater over fly ash bed by inclusion of a single geotextile separator representing jute geotextile in between the fly ash bed and underlying clay. The cellular mattress-fly ash composite bed produced an approximately sevenfold increment in the footing capacity compared with the unreinforced fly ash bed both in presence of the jute separator. The mattress-reinforced beds produced better footing capacity with an increase in the height and width of the mattress and the tensile stiffness of the cell wall. It is satisfactory to acquire the optimization for the height and width of mattress and the tensile stiffness of the cell wall. For a particular mattress width and height, the footing capacity increased with a reduction in the cell diameter. The cell at the mattress center mobilized maximum <b>hoop</b> <b>tension</b> that was lesser in the cells successively toward the mattress periphery.

Tissue engineered bioscaffolds may be a treatment option for meniscal incompetency, and ideally would possess meniscus-like extracellular matrix (ECM) and withstand meniscal tensile hoop strains. Synovium may be a useful cell source for meniscal tissue engineering because of its natural role in meniscal deficiency and its in vitro chondrogenic potential. The objective {{of this study is}} to compare meniscal-like extracellular matrix content of hyperconfluent synoviocyte cell sheets (“HCS”) and hyperconfluent synoviocyte sheets which have been <b>tensioned</b> over wire <b>hoops</b> (<b>tensioned</b> synoviocyte bioscaffolds, “TSB”) and cultured for 1 month. RESULTS: Long term culture with tension resulted in higher GAG concentration, higher chondrogenic index, higher collagen concentration, and type II collagen immunoreactivity in TSB versus HCS. Both HCS and TSB were immunoreactive for type I collagen, however, HCS had mild, patchy intracellular immunoreactivity while TSB had diffuse moderate immunoreactivity over the entire bisocaffold. The tissue architecture was markedly different between TSB and HCS, with TSB containing collagen organized in bands and sheets. Both HCS and TSB expressed alpha smooth muscle actin and displayed active contractile behavior. Double stranded DNA content was not different between TSB and HCS, while cell viability decreased in TSB. CONCLUSIONS: Long term culture of synoviocytes with tension improved meniscal-like extra cellular matrix components, specifically, the total collagen content, including type I and II collagen, and increased GAG content relative to HCS.

A brief look at {{the literature on the}} subject reveals a number of accounts of experimental tests on the behavior under bending of beams bound with FRP (Arduini 1994, Neubauer 1997, Rostasy 1984. 1993). Research regarding the theoretical aspects and finite element modeling is listed in Bencardino et al. All the papers mentioned involve steel reinforcement but do not consider cases in which corrosion problems make it impossible to quantify the ultimate bending moment because of the corrosion itself. To tackle this problem, which applies to a number of buildings in the ex industrial zone of Marghera, Venice, listed and protected as examples of historic industrial architecture, a research program was set up at the laboratories of the Venice University Institute of Architecture so as to be able to study the behavior under bending of this type of structure. It is well known that in the hypothesis of full composite action, the failure mode of a beam with steel reinforcement {{can be one of the}} following: steel yielding followed by concrete crushing or steel yielding followed by FRP fracture and concrete crushing. In the case of loss of composite action, debonding can be localized in the concrete, between the concrete and the adhesive, or between the adhesive and the FRP with failure by peeling-off. This research project aims to study the failure modes and identify a type of strengthening which avoids fragile type failure. At this point in the progression of the work, not all the experimental tests have been completely carried out. The results shown here regard the mechanical characteristics of the FRP, of the concrete and the bending tests with four different types of strengthening solutions tension wrapped at the stress zone. For comparison, the tests were carried out on a series of beams without the strengthening. The specimens tested were named as follows: UCS - Unstrengthened concrete test specimen; TWL - Test specimen tension wrapped with longitudinal strengthening; TWH - Test specimen <b>tension</b> wrapped with <b>hoop</b> strengthening; TWLH - Test specimen tension wrapped with longitudinal + hoop strengthening; TWHL - Test specimen <b>tension</b> wrapped with <b>hoop</b> + longitudinal...|$|R
40|$|NASA s Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) Program is {{examining}} the hybrid wing body (HWB) aircraft, among others, {{in an effort}} to increase the fuel efficiency of commercial aircraft. The HWB design combines features of a flying wing with features of conventional transport aircraft, and has the advantage of simultaneously increasing both fuel efficiency and payload. Recent years have seen an increased focus on the structural performance of the HWB. The key structural challenge of a HWB airframe is the ability to create a cost and weight efficient, non-circular, pressurized shell. Conventional round fuselage sections react cabin pressure by <b>hoop</b> <b>tension.</b> However, the structural configuration of the HWB subjects the majority of the structural panels to bi-axial, in-plane loads in addition to the internal cabin pressure, which requires more thorough examination and analysis than conventional transport aircraft components having traditional and less complex load paths. To address this issue, while keeping structural weights low, extensive use of advanced composite materials is made. This report presents the test data and preliminary conclusions for a pressurized cube test article that utilizes Boeing's Pultruded Rod Stitched Efficient Unitized Structure (PRSEUS), and {{which is part of the}} building block approach used for HWB development...|$|R
40|$|We use {{lubrication}} {{theory and}} matched asymptotic expansions {{to model the}} quasi-steady propagation of a liquid plug or bolus through an elastic tube. In the limit of small capillary number, asymptotic expressions are found for the pressure drop across the bolus and {{the thickness of the}} liquid film left behind, as functions of the capillary number, the thickness of the liquid lining ahead of the bolus and the elastic characteristics of the tube wall. These results generalise the well-known theory for the low-capillary-number motion of a bubble through a rigid tube (Bretherton 1961). As in that theory, both the pressure drop across the bolus and the thickness of the film it leaves behind vary like the two-thirds power of the capillary number. In our generalised theory, the coefficients in the power laws depend on the elastic properties of the tube. For a given thickness of the liquid lining ahead of the bolus, we identify a critical imposed pressure drop above which the bolus will eventually rupture, and hence the tube will reopen. We find that generically a tube with smaller <b>hoop</b> <b>tension</b> or smaller longitudinal tension is easier to reopen. This flow regime is fundamental to reopening of pulmonary airways, which may become plugged through disease or by instilled/aspirated fluids...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} global-in-radius linear {{analysis}} of the axisymmetric magnetorotational instability (MRI) in a collisional magnetized plasma with Braginskii viscosity. For a galactic angular velocity profile Ω we obtain analytic solutions for three magnetic field orientations: purely azimuthal, purely vertical and slightly pitched (almost azimuthal). In the first two cases the Braginskii viscosity damps otherwise neutrally stable modes, and reduces {{the growth rate of}} the MRI respectively. In the final case the Braginskii viscosity makes the MRI up to 2 √(2) times faster than its inviscid counterpart, even for asymptotically small pitch angles. We investigate the transition between the Lorentz-force-dominated and the Braginskii viscosity-dominated regimes in terms of a parameter ∼Ω/B^ 2 where is the viscous coefficient and B the Alfvén speed. In the limit where the parameter is small and large respectively we recover the inviscid MRI and the magnetoviscous instability (MVI). We obtain asymptotic expressions for the approach to these limits, and find the Braginskii viscosity can magnify the effects of azimuthal <b>hoop</b> <b>tension</b> (the growth rate becomes complex) by over an order of magnitude. We discuss the relevance of our results to the local approximation, galaxies and other magnetized astrophysical plasmas. Our results should prove useful for benchmarking codes in global geometries.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In meniscal root tears (MRTs), the {{disruption}} of collagen fibers that provide hoop strength results in extrusion of the menisci, altering their biomechanical properties. Clinical diagnosis is difficult, but magnetic resonance imaging usually allows to identify the lesion. Located into the vascularized zone of the meniscus, management is preferentially arthroscopic, aimed at repairing the lesions with arthroscopic transosseous sutures or suture anchors. SOURCES OF DATA: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar and Ovid Medline were searched in July 2012 to find literature on MRT tears. We reviewed the literature on biomechanics, imaging features and current treatments of these tears. Twenty-seven appropriate articles were identified and included in the study: 6 biomechanical studies, 11 imaging-based investigations for diagnosis, 1 study on clinical diagnosis and 9 studies about treatment. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: MRTs are infrequent, accounting for 10. 1 % of all arthroscopic meniscectomies. When the damage occurs to the roots, the transmission of the circumferential <b>hoop</b> <b>tension</b> is impaired and, consequently, the menisci tend to be displaced anteriorly and posteriorly, altering the biomechanics and possibly the kinematics of the knee. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Although {{the importance of the}} integrity of the meniscal roots is well established, their diagnosis and treatment are still controversial. GROWING POINTS: Biomechanical and clinical studies demonstrate that surgical repair of acute, traumatic meniscal root injuries fully restores the biomechanical features of the menisci, leading to pain relief and functional improvement. The current available surgical techniques for the meniscal root repair (suture anchors and pullout repair) are comparable. Level of evidence IV...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Ancient Stupas in Sri Lanka {{are solid}} structures, mostly {{composed}} of burnt bricks. Some of them {{date back to}} the third century BC, and some attained gigantic proportions, making them the largest brick structures in the world. At the turn of the 19 th century AD all of the ancient stupas were in ruins, covered with vegetation. Initially rehabilitation of these stupas were attempted in haphazard ways, but presently modern principles of archaeological heritage management are applied to the conservation and restoration of these historical structures. Mirisaveti stupa (2 nd century BC) is a good example for a complete restoration. It had only the cracked dome {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century after repairs by the British, and an ill planned restoration in 1987 resulted in a collapse of the stupa. After a thorough study the stupa was restored to its original form in 1995. In the case of Jetavana (3 rd century AD) a conservation rather than a full restoration is presently done. The dome, which is covered with vegetation, is cleaned and a new layer of brick is added on top of ancient bricks. The square chamber has to undergo major repairs as some parts of it had suffered serious damage. In the case of Tissamaharama (2 nd century BC), equally spaced meridional cracks appeared on the surface of the dome towards its mid height due to <b>hoop</b> <b>tension.</b> In order to halt the spread of these cracks, external pre-stressing was done using circumferential cables fixed to the dome...|$|R
