5|$|In {{addition}} to distributing the letter <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>media,</b> Albizu wrote his own, charging that Rhoads {{was part of}} a US plot to exterminate Puerto Ricans.

Later that year Governor Beverley struggled with a greater political crisis than the Rhoads letter over his own remarks encouraging birth control use on the island.
