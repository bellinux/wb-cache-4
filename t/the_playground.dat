5|$|Shortly after birth, Bertram {{declares}} {{war with}} Stewie for control over <b>the</b> <b>playground.</b> They confront {{each other in}} <b>the</b> <b>playground</b> with F-117 Nighthawks and AH-1 Cobras, firing numerous bullets at each other. After the air battle ends with no winners, Bertram resorts to biological warfare, and infects Stewie with chickenpox. After recovering, an enraged Stewie confronts Bertram, and they engage in a sword fight in the play area. Stewie eventually wins by disarming Bertram, and later that night, is seen suspiciously digging a hole with Christopher Moltisanti, but the hole is actually for a young tree. Stewie explains to Christopher that Bertram admitted defeat to Stewie and ran away.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{present the}} results of the process {{evaluation}} of <b>the</b> <b>PLAYgrounds</b> program, using <b>the</b> RE-AIM framework. Design: This study provides information regarding Reach, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance. Methods: <b>The</b> <b>PLAYgrounds</b> program promotes increasing levels of physical activity in 6 - 12 years old children and was evaluated using the RE-AIM framework in 4 intervention schools. Data collection consisted of a physical activity questionnaire with children (n= 765, Reach), SOPLAY observations (Implementation and Maintenance), questionnaires on the satisfaction of the implemented elements with teachers (n= 59) and children (n= 730, Implementation) and interviews for increased depth of information. In addition a simple counting of participating schools, describing of non-participating reasons and characteristics of the schools were documented (Adoption). Results: Reach of the target population (i. e. inactive children) was 60. 7 % (n= 464) and the target population was representative for populations in low-SES neighbourhoods. <b>The</b> <b>PLAYgrounds</b> program was adopted by 4 schools (80 %), at which 5 (from 7) program elements were successfully implemented. At 18 months follow-up, 3 of those 5 elements were completely maintained. Conclusions: Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance proved to be very high. Most likely due to <b>the</b> <b>PLAYgrounds</b> program being a complete intervention package that included financial, material, and staff support. Therefore, it is recommended to retain this high level of support when introducing <b>the</b> <b>PLAYgrounds</b> (or any other intervention) program in schools. In the future it would be recommended to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>PLAYgrounds</b> program on maintenance in schools where the key-person is employed at the school and funding is not available. © 2012 Sports Medicine Australia...|$|R
5|$|Numerous small {{parks are}} {{throughout}} {{all parts of}} Hamersley, usually joining the ends of several cul-de-sacs {{and in some cases}} containing wooden benches or children's play equipment. The Rannoch-Tay-Earn reserve in eastern Hamersley also contains two barbecues. The introduction of a barbecue and new playground equipment to the reserve first came in the late 1990s. 2008–2009 has seen the introduction of a new barbecue area due west of <b>the</b> <b>playground</b> with more introductions to the reserve to come.|$|E
5|$|The {{buildings}} are often purpose-built {{on a site}} where around 30-40m2 of playing space is available for each child in <b>the</b> <b>playground.</b> Around 6 m2 per child is allocated indoors. The institutions are intended to be mixed sex. Playschools are intended for {{children under the age}} of six; the youngest children to attend are at least two years old. Children of single parents and students are given priority, and in some cases children with a handicap are also given priority. In the majority of cases, the children are divided into age groups, but in some smaller communities these may be grouped together.|$|E

Coulson reforms his original S.H.I.E.L.D. team of May, Ward, Skye, Leo Fitz, and Jemma Simmons, and they fly to the Arctic in their old mobile command base, a plane called the Bus. Their approach is detected by Hydra, who shoot down the Bus with missiles, but the team escape in a quinjet and infiltrate the base with Bakshi's help. Coulson, May, and Fitz break into the base's control rooms to steal information about Hydra leader Wolfgang von Strucker's primary headquarters in the small Eastern European nation of Sokovia, while Skye, Ward, Bakshi, and Simmons rescue Peterson and Campbell. During the rescue, Simmons attempts to kill Ward as she once promised she would, but Bakshi {{gets in the way}} and Simmons murders him instead, and Ward flees after sparing Simmons' life.|$|E
5|$|Extensive {{building}} {{development was}} completed in 1908, which included converting the chapel back to religious use, a redesigned School Lodge and a block of six classrooms designed by Edward Boardman called the New Buildings. To secure its finances the school accepted {{a grant from the}} Board of Education in return for offering 10 percent of its intake to places funded by central government. The First World War saw the establishment of an Officers Training Corps company associated with the Norfolk Regiment, which disbanded in 1918. Pupil numbers grew steadily to 277 in 1930 and there was further modernisation of the curriculum. During the Second World War several buildings were destroyed in the Baedeker raids on Norwich, while School End House was commandeered by the Auxiliary Territorial Service and the Bishop's Palace was used by the American Red Cross. Inhumations were reportedly disturbed in 1939 when air-raid shelters were being dug on the current site of <b>the</b> <b>playground,</b> previously the old cathedral cemetery. In total, 102 pupils who attended the school died in the two world wars.|$|E

5|$|Hutton {{was born}} on 23 June 1916 in the Moravian {{community}} of Fulneck, Pudsey, the youngest of five children to Henry Hutton and his wife Lily (née Swithenbank).

As Tom's team and local police surround <b>the</b> <b>playground,</b> Khaldun attempts to talk Abu out of the attack. However, when he fails, Khaldun throws himself as Abu detonates the bomb, in order to avoid further casualties. Later, CIA liaison Christine Dale voices disappointment towards Khaldun's death, but appears grateful that Tom is unharmed.|$|E
