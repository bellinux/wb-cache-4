5|$|Gliese 3634 b {{was one of}} {{a sample}} of over 300 very-low-mass stars {{targeted}} by astronomers in search of planets that may orbit such stars. Using the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) at La Silla Observatory in Chile, six years of radial velocity data led the astronomers in the discovery of eleven other planets. After these discoveries, the astronomers chose <b>to</b> <b>refocus</b> their search on short-period planets, hoping to follow up after discoveries using the radial velocity method with a search for planets that also transited, or crossed in front of, their host stars as seen from Earth.|$|E
5|$|Impero {{was laid}} down in May 1938 and {{launched}} in November 1939. The entrance of Italy into World War II forced the Regia Marina <b>to</b> <b>refocus</b> its construction priorities on escort warships, so Impero was left incomplete. After Italy surrendered to the Allies on 8 September 1943, {{the rest of the}} Italian Navy steamed to Sardinia to rendezvous with their American contemporaries. Still incomplete in Trieste, Impero was captured by the Germans, who used the hulk for target practice. Sunk by Allied bombers in February 1945, she was refloated in 1947 and scrapped in Venice from 1948 to 1950.|$|E

5|$|Arjona {{released}} his thirteenth studio album, Independiente, on 4 October 2011. It became his fourth number-one on the Top Latin Albums chart the week ending 22 October 2011; {{and within a}} week went Gold in Chile, United States and Mexico; and Platinum in Venezuela and Argentina. Independiente was his first release as an independent artist, appearing on his Metamorfosis label, a company he created <b>to</b> <b>refocus</b> his career. The album was distributed by Warner. Billboard noted that although other groups have decided to go independent after working with major record labels, Arjona {{was by far the}} most important artist in Latin pop to do so. By the end of 2012, the album sold more than 75,000 copies in the United States and 400,000 copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the Navy {{withdrew from the}} project. Stormfury began <b>to</b> <b>refocus</b> its efforts on understanding, rather than modifying, {{tropical}} cyclones. At the same time, the Project's aircraft were {{nearing the end of}} their operational lifetimes. At the cost of $30million (year unknown) two Lockheed P-3's were acquired. Due to the rarity of Atlantic hurricanes meeting the safety requirements, plans were made to move Stormfury to the Pacific and experiment on the large number of typhoons there. This action required many of the same safety requirements as in the Atlantic, but had the advantage of a much higher number of potential subjects.|$|E
5|$|Newly {{discovered}} planets, particularly {{ones that}} are potentially habitable, have enabled SETI and METI programs <b>to</b> <b>refocus</b> projects for communication with extraterrestrial intelligence. In 2009 A Message From Earth (AMFE) was sent toward the Gliese 581 planetary system, which contains two potentially habitable planets, the confirmed Gliese 581d and the more habitable but unconfirmed Gliese 581g. In the SETILive project, which began in 2012, human volunteers analyze data from the Allen Telescope Array to search for possible alien signals that computers might miss because of terrestrial radio interference. The data for the study is obtained by observing Kepler target stars with the radio telescope.|$|E

5|$|During the {{preliminary}} round at the World Championships, Sacramone {{qualified for the}} event finals on floor and vault {{and contributed to the}} top-qualifying position of the American team. She also posted a score on beam that would have been high enough to qualify her to the beam final. However, due to an International Federation of Gymnastics rule allowing only two athletes per country to participate in each event final, Sacramone was unable to compete for a beam medal, because teammates Liukin and Shawn Johnson qualified ahead of her. In the team final, she competed on vault, beam and floor, earning scores of 15.750, 15.600 and 15.325, respectively. When the American team faltered after a difficult beam rotation, in which two gymnasts made major errors, Sacramone gathered the team for a pep talk <b>to</b> <b>refocus</b> them for floor. The American team earned 184.400 points overall, which was good enough to secure the gold medal ahead of China and Romania.|$|E
5|$|Early {{work was}} {{promising}} {{and by the}} fall of 1976 the project was building momentum. Fans organized a mail campaign that flooded the White House with 400,000 letters, influencing President Gerald Ford to rechristen the Space Shuttle Constitution to Enterprise. Bryant and Scott's proposal became the first accepted by the studio in October; Roddenberry immediately stopped work on other projects <b>to</b> <b>refocus</b> on Star Trek, and the screenwriters and producers were swamped with grateful fan mail. By the start of 1977 the project's official title was changed to Star Trek—The Motion Picture (a title reapplied to the eventually released 1979 film). The elation was short-lived; the first draft of the completed script was not finished until March 1, 1977, and pressure was mounting for Paramount to either begin production or cut its losses and cancel the project. Producer Jerry Isenberg began scouting filming locations and hired designers and illustrators to complement the script.|$|E
5|$|Tri-Star Pictures {{had planned}} to release the film using a {{platform}} technique which involved opening it in select cities before releasing it nationwide. The studio was confident that the limited theatrical run would generate strong-word-of-mouth interest and awards consideration for the film. Birdy opened in limited release on December 21, 1984 in New York City, Los Angeles and Toronto. The film's failure to garner any award nominations during the limited run resulted in Tri-Star cancelling a wide release scheduled for late January 1985. In response, A Films prompted the studio <b>to</b> <b>refocus</b> the film's marketing campaign. Tri-Star adjusted its promotional focus on the friendship between Birdy and Al, while Parker, Modine and Cage heavily promoted the film by personally visiting critics, journalists and radio reporters. Birdy was a box office bomb, grossing only $1,455,045 in the United States and Canada, well below its estimated budget of $12 million.|$|E
40|$|Resolved NMR spectra from {{samples in}} inhomogeneous B- 0 and B- 1 fields can be {{obtained}} with the so-called "ex situ" methodology, employing a train of composite or adiabatic z-rotation RF pulses <b>to</b> periodically <b>refocus</b> the inhomogeneous broadening during the detection of the time-domain signal. Earlier schemes relied on a linear correlation between the inhomogeneous B 0 and B, fields. Here the pulse length, bandwidth, and amplitude of the adiabatic pulses of the hyperbolic secant type are adjusted <b>to</b> improve the <b>refocusing</b> for a setup with non-linear correlation. The field correlation is measured using a two-dimensional nutation experiment augmented with a third dimension with varying RF carrier frequency accounting for off-resonance effects. The pulse optimization is performed with a computer algorithm using the experimentally determined field correlation and a standard adiabatic z-rotation pulse {{as a starting point}} for the iterative optimization procedure. The shape of the z-rotation RF pulse is manipulated <b>to</b> provide <b>refocusing</b> for the conditions given by the sample-, magnet-, and RF-coil geometry. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} {{systematic}} {{construction of a}} reduction-free normalization function. Starting from a reduction-based normalization function, i. e., the transitive closure of a one-step reduction function, we successively subject it <b>to</b> <b>refocusing</b> (i. e., deforestation of the intermediate reduced terms), simplification (i. e., fusing auxiliary functions), refunctionalization (i. e., Church encoding), and direct-style transformation (i. e., the converse of the CPS transformation). We consider two simple examples and treat them in detail: for the first one, arithmetic expressions, we construct an evaluation function; for the second one, terms in the free monoid, we construct an accumulator-based flatten function. The resulting two functions are traditional reduction-free normalization functions. The construction builds on previous work on refocusing and on a functional correspondence between evaluators and abstract machines. It is also reversible...|$|R
5|$|After the {{repeated}} German counterattacks prevented any lasting roadblock Truscott finally allowed reinforcements from the 45thDivision to support Dahlquist at Montélimar, {{as he felt}} the successful operations further south at the French ports allowed him <b>to</b> <b>refocus</b> to the north. At the same time, the Germans also reinforced their fighting force. Over the next days a stalemate emerged, with the Allies unable to block the retreat route and the Germans unable to clear {{the area of the}} Allied forces. Both sides became increasingly frustrated during the fighting, with attack, counterattack, and spoiling attacks, which made it hard for the 36thDivision to launch a decisive offensive. Whilst the 36thDivision had surrounded the 19thArmy, they themselves were almost surrounded, too, during the chaotic fighting, with only a thin supply route to the east open, resulting in their having to fight to the front and the rear. As the 36thDivision was seemingly making no progress, an angry Truscott arrived at Dahlquist's headquarters on 26August to relieve him of command. However, on seeing the heavy terrain and shattered forces, he refrained and left the headquarters again. Finally, during 26–28August, the majority of the German forces were able to escape, leaving behind 4,000 burnt-out vehicles and 1,500 dead horses. On 29August the Allies captured Montélimar, and the final German troops trying to break out surrendered. The Germans suffered 2,100 battle casualties plus 8,000 POWs, while the Americans had 1,575 casualties. Total POW losses of the 19thArmy now amounted to 57,000.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} of the landing at Porton Plantation, the planned Australian advance into the Bonis Peninsula was called off. The Australian high command decided <b>to</b> <b>refocus</b> their efforts upon the drive towards Buin in the south and as a result the effort in the north was reduced to that of a holding action as further {{resources}} were transferred out of the sector. Following the withdrawal, the 31st/51st Infantry Battalion continued fighting along the Ratsua front before being relieved on 28 June by the 8th Infantry Battalion and withdrawing to Torokina, where they remained {{until the end of the}} war. The 23rd Brigade under Brigadier Arnold Potts took over control of the sector, and for a period of four weeks along the Ratsua front the 8th and 27th Infantry Battalions carried out patrolling operations before the Australians decided to withdraw to the Buoi Plantation in mid-July, by which time the Japanese forces in the area, boosted by their victory at Porton, had begun to seize the initiative through the use of harassment tactics. Following this several small-scale actions continued along the front until offensive action was discontinued on 11 August 1945 as the war came to a conclusion.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We apply {{optical and}} {{perspective}} tests to the carpet in Lorenzo Lotto’s “Husband and Wife ” (c. 1543) {{to test the}} claim that this painting was executed by tracing an optically projected image. While the perspective exhibits many inaccuracies consistent with this claim, such inaccuracies are equally consistent with non-optical explanations, such as artistic freehand for features that are peripheral {{to the theme of}} the painting. Further, a number of properties—specifically the perspective inconsistencies within some putative projection regions—are incompatible with the use of projections. We explore perspective in carpets in other Lotto paintings and find perspective incoherence that is unlikely due <b>to</b> <b>refocusing</b> or depth of field problems in a projection, the putative source in “Husband and wife. ” Our analyses and the lack of supporting historical evidence lead us to reject claims for “proofs ” that projections were used in the creation of this painting...|$|R
