5|$|Brinkley's {{activities}} {{inspired the}} film industry term 'goat gland' — the grafting of talkie sequences onto silent films <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> marketable.|$|E
5|$|The United States editions {{were adapted}} into American English <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> more {{understandable}} {{to a young}} American audience.|$|E
5|$|Even though Opera Mini {{is based}} on the same {{rendering}} engine as Opera for personal computers, it does not pass the Acid2 test. This is because Opera Mini intentionally reformats web pages to try <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> more suitable for devices with small screens.|$|E

6000|$|... 'That's acause they damped {{the straw}} afore they lit {{it in the}} chimbley <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>'em</b> come down again,' said Gamfield; 'that's all smoke, and no blaze; vereas smoke ain't o' no use at all in making a boy come down, for it only sinds him to sleep, and that's wot he likes. Boys is wery obstinit, and wery lazy, Gen'l'men, and there's nothink like a good hot blaze <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>'em</b> come down vith a run. It's humane too, gen'l'men, acause, even if they've stuck in the chimbley, {{roasting}} their feet <b>makes</b> <b>'em</b> struggle <b>to</b> hextricate theirselves.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I {{should say}} so,' said Abner, 'sellin' for thirty-six hundred dollars! But {{what is there}} so all-fired good about <b>'em</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>'em</b> sell like that?' ...|$|R
5|$|Female Carolina wrens possess song control {{regions that}} would appear <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> capable of singing with {{repertoires}} like the male. Due to vocalizations that they occasionally make with the male, {{it has been}} suggested that song perception plays a role and is of behavioral relevance.|$|E
5|$|In Northern Montenegro, peasants rub Phallus impudicus on the necks of bulls before bull {{fighting}} contests in {{an attempt}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> stronger. They are also fed to young bulls as they {{are thought to be}} a potent aphrodisiac.|$|E
5|$|A major {{technological}} {{application of}} this information is metabolic engineering. Here, organisms such as yeast, plants or bacteria are genetically modified <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> more useful in biotechnology and aid the production of drugs such as antibiotics or industrial chemicals such as 1,3-propanediol and shikimic acid. These genetic modifications usually aim {{to reduce the amount}} of energy used to produce the product, increase yields and reduce the production of wastes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, a hairy sort of nothin' {{what you}} put in {{balloons}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>'em</b> go up. And you used to burn it till the 'lectricity come." ...|$|R
6000|$|Milt grinned irresistibly. [...] "Not a friend. But I'm going <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>'em.</b> I'm going <b>to</b> take up engineering, {{and some}} French, I guess, at the {{university}} there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm going <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>'em</b> up {{a little}} fire in the parlor stove. I guess they won't want us round a great deal, when they come back." ...|$|R
5|$|Another legacy was the Arbeitsstab Wiederaufbau zerstörter Städte (Working {{group on}} Reconstruction of {{destroyed}} cities), authorized by Speer in 1943 to rebuild bombed German cities <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> more livable {{in the age}} of the automobile. Headed by Wolters, the working group took a possible military defeat into their calculations. The Arbeitsstabs recommendations served as the basis of the postwar redevelopment plans in many cities, and Arbeitsstab members became prominent in the rebuilding.|$|E
5|$|Around 212AD, {{soon after}} Vologases VI of Parthia (r. c.208–222AD) took the throne, his brother Artabanus V of Parthia (d.224AD) rebelled {{against him and}} gained control over a greater part of the empire. Meanwhile, the Roman emperor Caracalla (r.211–217AD) deposed the kings of Osroene and Armenia <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> Roman provinces once more. He marched into Mesopotamia under the pretext of marrying one of Artabanus' daughters, but—because the {{marriage}} was not allowed—made war on Parthia and conquered Arbil east of the Tigris river.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{the study}} are Churchill's bedroom and his ensuite bathroom, with sunken bath. At {{the time of}} the house's opening to the public in 1966, these rooms were not made accessible, at the request of Churchill's family but, shortly before her death in 2014, Churchill's {{daughter}} Mary gave permission for their opening, and the Trust plans <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> accessible by 2020.|$|E
6000|$|... "So I nat'rally s'posed. Well, the old {{man says}} you can come out on promises, if you're {{disposed}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>'em.</b> So you're master of your own movements, you see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On you?" [...] says Buck, winking solemn. [...] "Don't {{you go and}} try <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>'em</b> {{believe at}} the office you said that. Thanks. We can't spare the time, I reckon. So long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We, even on unchallenged seas, [...] Dare not {{adventure}} {{where we}} would, But forfeit brave advantages [...] For lack of men <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>'em</b> good; Whereby, <b>to</b> England's double cost. Honour and profit both are lost!' ...|$|R
5|$|Derrickson {{was fascinated}} by color schemes. He chose blue-green and orange as the primary colors for The Day the Earth Stood Still. The missile silo {{converted}} by the military for experimenting on Gort emphasized gray and orange, which was inspired by an image of lava flowing through a gray field. Derrickson opted to shoot on traditional film, and rendered the colors in post-production <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> more subtle, for realism.|$|E
5|$|During his pontificate Innocent XII {{worked to}} improve {{relations}} with Louis XIV of France. He reached a compromise with the French king by agreeing to the confirmation of all bishops that Louis had created since 1682 {{in return for the}} king's promise not <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> abide by the Declaration of the Clergy of France.|$|E
5|$|Extensive {{work was}} put into {{creating}} a genuine and historically correct atmosphere for the film. The facades of the houses of Mirabeau had to be replaced with painted polystyrene, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> look older, and all electric wires were put underground. Meanwhile, in Vaugines, Berri planted a dozen olive trees twelve months before filming started, and watered them throughout the waiting period, and for the second installment planted 10,000 carnations on the farm.|$|E
50|$|Pay {{attention}} to rules, and <b>to</b> who <b>makes</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Believe I've {{told the}} truth, an' {{that is enough}} for me," [...] Sam replied, with a choking sob. [...] "Tell the folks at home about it, but try <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>'em</b> know I never stole a dollar." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor William, afflicted as he is, his HEART'S aluz right. Asks me {{to invite}} {{everybody}} {{to come to}} the funeral--wants me <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>'em</b> all welcome. But he needn't a worried--it was jest what I was at." ...|$|R
5|$|Group E {{is located}} {{to the west}} of Group C. Group E is largely {{surrounded}} by steep ravines; the inhabitants of the city cut the cliffs <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> steeper and more defensible, and reinforced them with a retaining wall. Archaeological investigations failed to find any access stairway through the retaining wall to Group E.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds is {{a mobile}} puzzle video game where players touch circles <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> grow without overlapping. In the game's 100 levels, the player interacts with {{different}} types of circles to bring a counter to the number 100. The game was developed and published by Semi Secret Software in collaboration with Greg Wohlwend and was released for iOS on January 7, 2013, and on Android later that year.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, media mogul Ted Turner {{announced}} he would begin colourising black-and-white motion pictures <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> more pleasing to audiences watching his cable networks. The announcement generated extensive controversy. Touring Turner's colourisation facilities {{as a member of}} the Directors Guild, Wise learned that Turner was colourising The Haunting. Wise was able to prevent the colourisation by pointing to his contract, which stated the picture could only be in black-and-white.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pshaw!" [...] replied Aunt Em. [...] "I've raised {{chickens}} {{for nearly}} forty years, Billina, and I know you've got <b>to</b> starve <b>'em</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>'em</b> lay lots of eggs, and stuff 'em {{if you want}} good broilers." ...|$|R
6000|$|Felix {{was about}} to give some evasive explanation, when Mali {{interposed}} with her simple, unthinking translation. [...] "Them say, Missy Queenie very good and kind. <b>Make</b> <b>them</b> sad <b>to</b> think. <b>Make</b> <b>them</b> cry <b>to</b> see her. <b>Make</b> <b>them</b> cry <b>to</b> see Missy Queenie Korong. Too good. Too pretty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You wouldn’t {{believe the}} job we ’ad to wake that man up. He wasn’t fairly woke till he was hauled out of ’is bunk an’ set down {{opposite}} them two pore black fellers an’ told <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>’em</b> white again.|$|R
5|$|Integral {{elements}} of sustainability are {{research and innovation}} activities. A telling example is the European environmental research and innovation policy. It aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening {{the economy and the}} society as a whole so <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> sustainable. Research and innovation in Europe are financially supported by the programme Horizon 2020, which is also open to participation worldwide.|$|E
5|$|It {{took several}} years {{and a team of}} assistants to piece {{together}} the scanned fragments (many only half a page in width) of the hundreds of documents photocopied by Bukovsky and then, in 1999, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> available online. Many of the same documents were extensively quoted and cited in Bukovsky's Judgment in Moscow (1995), where he described and analysed what he had uncovered about recent Soviet history and about the relations of the USSR and the CPSU with the West.|$|E
5|$|Part of the National Policy was {{implemented}} in the budget presented in February 1879. Under that budget, Canada became a high-tariff nation like the United States and Germany. The tariffs were designed to protect and build Canadian industry—finished textiles received a tariff of 34%, but the machinery <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> entered Canada free. Macdonald continued to fight for higher tariffs {{for the remainder of}} his life.|$|E
6000|$|... "Or a boat," [...] added Larry. [...] "Oh, I hope we {{can catch}} <b>them,</b> just <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>'em</b> pay for these hurt fingers of mine!" [...] And he shut his teeth hard, for the wounds pained him not a little.|$|R
6000|$|... "If they ain't {{found out}} nuthin' about them twins, I'm going <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>'em</b> my own," [...] {{said the old}} frontiersman. [...] "I ain't got no chick nor child, an' I {{might as well be}} a-doin' somethin' for {{somebody}} in this world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Aunt Em, [...] "the {{flies in}} Kansas, where I came from, don't {{understand}} {{anything but a}} swat. You have <b>to</b> smash <b>'em</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>'em</b> behave; and it's {{the same way with}} 'skeeters. Do you have 'skeeters in Oz?" ...|$|R
