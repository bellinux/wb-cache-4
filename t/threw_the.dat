50|$|Spike: This throw can be {{used when}} the ball is caught in the front half of the court.

The key to a {{successful}} spike is <b>throwing</b> <b>the</b> ball toward the ground as fast and hard as possible. The player does not want to lob the ball over the net in an arch; rather they want to throw it in a direct line to the opponents' back half.|$|R
