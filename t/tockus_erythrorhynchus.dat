50|$|The {{northern}} {{red-billed hornbill}} (<b>Tockus</b> <b>erythrorhynchus)</b> is {{a species of}} hornbill in the family Bucerotidae. It is found from southern Mauritania through Somalia and northeast Tanzania. All five red-billed hornbills were formerly considered conspecific.|$|E
50|$|Among {{creatures that}} prey on C. jonesii are large centipedes {{of the genus}} Scolopendra, the ground {{foraging}} red-billed hornbill (<b>Tockus</b> <b>erythrorhynchus)</b> and eastern yellow-billed hornbill (T. flavirostris), bushveld gerbil (Gerbilliscus leucogaster), Cape porcupine (Hystrix africaeaustralis) and lesser red musk shrew (Crocidura hirta).|$|E
50|$|The red-billed {{hornbills}} are a {{group of}} hornbills found in savanna and woodland of sub-Saharan Africa. They are now usually split into five species, the northern red-billed hornbill (<b>Tockus</b> <b>erythrorhynchus),</b> western red-billed hornbill (T. kempi), Tanzanian red-billed hornbill (T. ruahae), southern red-billed hornbill (T. rufirostris) and Damara red-billed hornbill (T. damarensis), but some authorities considered them all to be subspecies of a single species.|$|E
50|$|Various upland birds {{recorded}} as prey include the 177 g Namaqua sandgrouse (Pterocles namaqua), the 350 g rock pigeon (Columba livia), the 84 g laughing dove (Streptopelia senegalensis), the 169 g Senegal coucal (Centropus senegalensis), the 49 g scaly-throated honeyguide (Indicator variegatus) and {{several species of}} hornbill, {{ranging in size from}} the 139 g northern red-billed hornbill (<b>Tockus</b> <b>erythrorhynchus)</b> to the 1235 g silvery-cheeked hornbill (Bycanistes brevis). Among passerines, the most frequently taken are likely to be corvids, which are often favored by Bubo owls from around the world due to their large size, relatively open nests and frequently easy-to-find, communal nocturnal roosts. To date the cape crow (Corvus capensis) and pied crow (Corvus albus) are the corvids reported in dietary studies but in Ethiopia thick-billed ravens (Corvus crassirostris), which at 1500 g are possible the heaviest corvid species in the world, mobbed them vigorously and seemed to consider them a primary threat. Smaller passerines are by no means ignored. White-eyes are among the more frequently taken smaller passerines, with the 10.9 g African yellow white-eye (Zosterops senegalensis) being the smallest identified avian prey species, although penduline tits (Anthoscopus ssp.) (thus far unidentified to species) are likely to be even smaller. The largest bird to be hunted to Verreaux's eagle-owl is {{complicated by the fact that}} they often take relatively small nestlings of larger species, such as ostriches (Struthio camelus) and grey crowned cranes (Balearica regulorum). The only avian prey items successfully attacked larger than other types of birds of prey (reviewed later) are likely bustards. Most predation records have reported on relatively small bustards, namely northern (Afrotis afraoides) and southern black korhaans (Afrotis afra), which average only 745 g and 690 g, respectively. Larger species of bustard thought to be threatened by Verreaux's eagle-owl are the 4790 g Denham's bustard (Neotis denhami) and the 8430 g kori bustard (Ardeotis kori), although it is not clear whether adults (especially males) are attacked in the latter species.|$|E
40|$|In 2011 - 2012, {{the line}} {{transect}} method {{was employed to}} study avian assemblages in the Koakoland (Mopane) Savanna around the Ruacana waterfall in the Kunene Region, north-western Namibia. In total 64 resident species were recorded, a number which was high in comparison with other bushy habitats. Simpson’s Diversity Index was also high (S = 0. 96). Group of dominant species (32. 4 %) comprised Streptopelia capicola, <b>Tockus</b> <b>erythrorhynchus,</b> Plocepasser mahali, Pycnonotis nigricans and Lanioturdus torquatus. The following species recorded as resident around Ruacana Waterfall were endemic to Namibia: Poicephalus rueppellii, Phoeniculus damarensis, Lanioturdus torquatus, Tockus damarensis and Parus carpi. Although {{the difference between the}} riparian and dry variety of the Mopane Savanna was insignificant in terms of biodiversity (S = 0. 97 and S = 0. 92 respectively), the number of species in dry bush was much lower than in the riparian bush (χ 2 -test = 4. 76; p < 0. 05). Also the Sörensen similarity coefficient was unexpectedly low between the two habitat varieties (I = 0. 48) ...|$|E
