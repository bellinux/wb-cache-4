5000|$|In August 1997, John Hancock {{deployed}} {{to the coast}} of Tunisia to participate in Exercise NADOR 97-3. John Hancock was also there in March for NADOR 97-2. For NADOR 97-3, the John Hancock crew operated with two <b>Tunisian</b> <b>combatant</b> patrol boats and increased the level of difficulty. They conducted air and high speed surface gunnery exercises, air tracking and engagement simulations, and free-play [...] "encounter" [...] exercises. John Hancock also performed a maritime interdiction demonstration on board the two patrol boats. Simulating merchant vessels, the patrol boats were queried using the bridge-to-bridge radio. After evaluating the suspect merchants answers, John Hancocks boarding team was sent to each vessel using a rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB). The boarding team inspected each merchants manifest and cargo, and directed the suspect vessel to continue on its journey or divert to the nearest port for a full inspection of cargo.|$|R

2500|$|Judge Juan del Olmo found [...] "local {{cells of}} Islamic extremists {{inspired}} through the Internet" [...] guilty for the 11 March attacks, not Armed Islamic Group or Moroccan Islamic <b>Combatant</b> <b>Group.</b> These local cells consist of hashish traffickers of Moroccan origin, remotely {{linked to an}} al-Qaeda cell that had been already captured.

25|$|The United States {{played a}} facilitative {{role in the}} peace talks in Washington during {{the months leading up}} to the May 1991 fall of the Mengistu regime. In mid-May, Mengistu {{resigned}} as head of the Ethiopian Government and went into exile in Zimbabwe, leaving a caretaker government in Addis Ababa. Having defeated the Ethiopian forces in Eritrea, EPLF troops took control of their homeland. Later that month, the United States chaired talks in London to formalize the end of the war. These talks were attended by the four major <b>combatant</b> <b>groups,</b> including the EPLF.|$|R
5000|$|Salafia Jihadia (السلفية الجهادية [...] ) is a Salafi {{jihadist}} {{militant group}} based in Morocco and Spain with links to al-Qaeda. The group {{is associated with the}} Moroccan Islamic <b>Combatant</b> <b>Group</b> (GICM), and in addition to a series of religiously sanctioned extrajudicial killings, it was notably responsible for the 2003 Casablanca bombings, in which twelve suicide bombers killed 33 people and injured over 100. Salafia Jihadia has variously been described as a movement or loose network of groups, or as a generic term applied by Moroccan authorities for militant Salafi activists.|$|R

50|$|The Moroccan Islamic <b>Combatant</b> <b>Group,</b> {{known by}} the French acronym GICM (Groupe Islamique Combattant Marocain), is a Salafi {{jihadist}} terrorist organisation affiliated with al-Qaeda. The GICM {{is one of several}} North African terrorist franchises spawned in Afghanistan during the tenure of the Taliban. The organisation and its associated members have been linked to major terrorist attacks including the 2003 Casablanca bombings that killed 33 people and wounded more than 100, and the 2004 Madrid train bombings that killed 191 people and wounded over 2,000. A crackdown against the organisation's numerous cells in Europe is thought to have since significantly damaged the GICM's capabilities.|$|R
50|$|In aerial warfare, {{the term}} overclaiming {{describes}} a <b>combatant</b> (or <b>group)</b> that claims {{the destruction of}} more enemy aircraft than actually achieved. The net effect is that the actual losses and claimed victories are unequal.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War II the French Army deployed 2,240,000 <b>combatants</b> <b>grouped</b> into 94 divisions (of which 20 were active and 74 were reservists) from the Swiss border to the North Sea. These numbers {{did not include the}} Army of the Alps facing Italy and 600,000 men dispersed through the French colonial empire are not included in this figure. After defeat in 1940, the Vichy French regime was allowed to retain 100-120,000 personnel in unoccupied France, and larger forces in the French Empire: more than 220,000 in Africa (including 140,000 in French North Africa), and forces in Mandate Syria and French Indochina.|$|R
5000|$|Abu Dujana {{has been}} speculated to be two people: Jamal Ahmidan [...] "the Chinese" [...] who was arrested after the attacks, or more likely Youssef Belhadj, a Moroccan based in Molenbeek, Belgium who in 2008 {{was found guilty of}} {{belonging}} to a terrorist group and sentenced to 12 years in prison, thought by Spanish authorities to be Abu Dujana. Belhajd, also thought to have been connected to the 2003 Casablanca bombings, was arrested in Belgium on 1 February 2005 and extradited to Spain. Convicted after the Madrid bombings, Belhadj was the leader of a Belgian cell of the Moroccan Islamic <b>Combatant</b> <b>Group</b> (GICM) along with Hassan el-Haski.|$|R
5000|$|The Saudis {{had been}} able to {{integrate}} into Moroccan society by marrying Moroccan women through the Moroccan Islamic <b>Combatant</b> <b>Group</b> (GICM). The wives of two of the men were arrested, suspected of having been used as money couriers for al-Qaeda and to have been aware of the plots; one of the two women attempted to hide explosives in her apartment when she was arrested by security forces. According to one official, the plot had been planned [...] "well before" [...] the September 11 attacks. Attacks were reportedly also planned in Morocco, notably in the tourist centre of Marrakesh. The three Saudi Arabians were sentenced to ten years imprisonment in February 2003.|$|R
5000|$|Salafia Jihadia {{was formed}} in the early 1990s by Mujahideen {{veterans}} of the Soviet-Afghan War. The group {{was formed in}} opposition to the Arab states, including Morocco, that had joined the coalition against Iraq in the Gulf War. Along with the Takfir wal-Hijra group, Salafia Jihadia was eventually responsible for around 300 murders in Morocco as punishment for [...] "non-Islamic behaviour." [...] The group has been associated with the Moroccan Islamic <b>Combatant</b> <b>Group</b> (GICM). It also had links to the former Algerian Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) and the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG). By 2002 the group had begun establishing ties with al-Qaeda, and had 400 known members.|$|R
5000|$|Australia, and Queensland in particular, had few civic monuments {{before the}} First World War. The {{memorials}} erected {{in the wake}} of the war became our first national monuments. Australia lost 60,000 from a population of about four million, representing one in five of those who served. The casualty rate of the Australian volunteer military forces was significantly and proportionally higher than any of the other <b>combatant</b> <b>groups,</b> claiming 20% of the Australian volunteers who served, and 1.5% of the total Australian population. Australia's maturity as a nation and continuing commitment to the [...] "motherland" [...] were proven beyond doubt. No previous or subsequent war has made such a devastating impact on the nation.|$|R
40|$|Like other peace {{agreements}} made to end {{civil wars}} {{in other parts}} of the world, the signing of the Bougainville Peace Agreement did not settle all outstanding issues between parties involved in the previous violence. Rather, the Agreement provides a baseline and a set of subsequent institutional arrangements for addressing and resolving differences through democratic processes sanctioned by laws giving effect to the Agreement. The baseline involves a shared commitment to secure lasting peace by peaceful means - to be implemented through weapons disposal, immunity from prosecution for Bougainville crisis-related activities, a pledge to disband former <b>combatant</b> <b>groups,</b> and agreement to operate within the framework of the Papua New Guinea Constitution as amended to give legal effect to the Agreement...|$|R
