2500|$|Herbivores {{generate}} {{enzymes that}} counter {{and reduce the}} effectiveness of numerous toxic secondary metabolic products produced by plants. [...] One such enzyme group, mixed function oxidases (MFOs), detoxify harmful plant compounds by catalyzing oxidative reactions. Cytochrome P450 oxidases (or P-450), a specific class of MFO, have been specifically connected to detoxification of plant secondary metabolic products. One group linked herbivore feeding on plant material protected by chemical defenses with P-450 detoxification in larval tobacco hornworms. The induction of P-450 after initial nicotine ingestion allowed the larval tobacco hornworms to increase feeding on the <b>toxic</b> <b>plant</b> tissues.|$|E

In particular, the city of Tlemcen still retains practices based on phytotherapy to the present day, as this kind of medicine fulfills the needs of its followers among the local population. The <b>toxic</b> <b>plants</b> contain diverse natural substances which supplied a lot of medicine in the pharmaceutical industry. In order to explore new medicinal sources among <b>toxic</b> <b>plants,</b> an ethnobotanical study was carried out on the use of these plants by the population, at Emir Abdelkader Square of the city of Tlemcen, a rather busy place with a high number of traditional health practitioners and herbalists. This is a descriptive and transversal study aimed at estimating the frequency of using <b>toxic</b> <b>plants</b> among the studied population, for a period of 4 months. The information was collected, using self-anonymous questionnaires, and analyzed by the IBM SPSS Statistics software used for statistical analysis. A sample of 200 people, including 120 women and 80 men, were interviewed. The mean age was 41 ± 16 years. Among those questioned, 83. 5 % used plants; 8 % of them used <b>toxic</b> <b>plants</b> and 35 % used plants that can be toxic under certain conditions. Some improvements were observed in 88 % of the cases where <b>toxic</b> <b>plants</b> were used. 80 medicinal plants, belonging to 36 botanical families, were listed, identified and classified. The most frequent indications for these plants were for respiratory diseases in 64. 7 % of cases, and for digestive disorders in 51. 5 % of cases. 11 % of these <b>plants</b> are <b>toxic,</b> 26 % could be toxic under certain conditions. Among <b>toxics</b> <b>plants,</b> the most common ones are Berberis vulgaris with 5. 4 %, indicated in the treatment of uterine fibroids and thyroid, Rhamnus alaternus with 4. 8 % for hepatic jaundice, Nerium oleander with 3 % for hemorrhoids, Ruta chalepensis with 1. 2 %, indicated for digestive disorders and dysmenorrhea, and Viscum album with 1. 2 %, indicated for respiratory diseases. The most common plants that could be toxic are Mentha pulegium (15. 6 %), Eucalyptus globulus (11. 4 %), and Pimpinella anisum (10. 2 %). This study revealed interesting results on the use of <b>toxic</b> <b>plants,</b> which are likely to serve as a basis for further ethno-pharmacological investigations in order to get new drug sources...|$|R
