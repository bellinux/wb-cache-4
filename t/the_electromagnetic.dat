5|$|Members of the British mission {{occupied}} {{several key}} positions in <b>the</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> project. Oliphant became Lawrence's de facto deputy, {{and was in}} charge of the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory when Lawrence was absent. His enthusiasm for <b>the</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> project was rivalled only by Lawrence's, and his involvement went beyond scientific problems, extending to policy questions such as whether to expand <b>the</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> plant, although in this he was unsuccessful. The British chemists made important contributions, particularly Harry Emeléus and Philip Baxter, a chemist who had been research manager at ICI, was sent to the Manhattan Project's Clinton Engineering Works at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, in 1944 in response to a request for assistance with uranium chemistry, and became personal assistant to the general manager. His status as an ICI employee was of no concern to Groves. The British mission was given complete access to <b>the</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> project, both in Berkeley and at the Y-12 electromagnetic separation plant in Oak Ridge. While some of the British mission remained at Berkeley or Oak Ridge only for a few weeks, most stayed until the end of the war. Oliphant returned to Britain in March 1945, and was replaced as head of the British mission in Berkeley by Massey.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> field can be {{understood}} as a gauge field, i.e., as a field that results from requiring that a gauge symmetry holds independently at every position in spacetime. For <b>the</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> field, this gauge symmetry is the Abelian U(1) symmetry of complex numbers of absolute value 1, which reflects the ability to vary the phase of a complex field without affecting observables or real valued functions made from it, such as the energy or the Lagrangian.|$|E

5|$|After the 1990–91 Gulf War, UNSCOM {{determined}} that Iraq had been pursuing a calutron program to enrich uranium. Iraq chose to develop <b>the</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> process over more modern, economic, and efficient methods of enrichment because calutrons were easier to build, with fewer technical challenges, and the components required {{to build them}} were not subject to export controls. At the time the program was discovered, Iraq {{was estimated to be}} two or three years away from producing enough material for nuclear weapons. The program was destroyed in the Gulf War. Consequently, the Nuclear Suppliers Group added <b>the</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> separation equipment to its guidelines for transfers of nuclear-related dual-use equipment, material and technology.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the forces}} in the {{universe}} are based on four fundamental interactions. The strong and weak forces are nuclear forces that act only at very short distances, and {{are responsible for the}} interactions between subatomic particles, including nucleons and compound nuclei. <b>The</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> force acts between electric charges, and the gravitational force acts between masses. All other forces in nature derive from these four fundamental interactions. For example, friction is a manifestation of <b>the</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> force acting between the atoms of two surfaces, and the Pauli exclusion principle, which does not permit atoms to pass through each other. Similarly, the forces in springs, modeled by Hooke's law, are the result of electromagnetic forces and the Exclusion Principle acting together to return an object to its equilibrium position. Centrifugal forces are acceleration forces that arise simply from the acceleration of rotating frames of reference.|$|E
5|$|Although we {{are used}} to {{thinking}} of supernovae primarily as luminous visible events, <b>the</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> radiation they release is almost a minor side-effect.

5|$|The {{experiments}} with the 184-inch magnet {{led to the}} construction of a prototype calutron called the XA. It contained a rectangular, three-coil magnet with a horizontal field in which the calutron tanks could stand side by side, with four vacuum tanks, each with a double source. At the 25 June 1942 meeting of the S-1 Executive Committee, which had superseded the S-1 Uranium Committee on 19 June, there was a proposal to build <b>the</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> plant at Oak Ridge, where the other Manhattan Project facilities would be located, for reasons of economy and security.
