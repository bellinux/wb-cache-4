5|$|The skull was {{structured}} {{in such a}} way that as it closed, the bones holding the teeth in the upper jaw would bow out. This would cause the lower surfaces of the upper jaw teeth to rub against the upper surface of the lower jaw's <b>teeth,</b> <b>grinding</b> anything caught in between and providing an action that is the rough equivalent of mammalian chewing. Because the teeth were always replaced, the animal could have used this mechanism throughout its life, and could eat tough plant material. Additionally, the front ends of the animal's jaws were toothless and tipped with bony nodes, both upper and lower, providing a rough margin that was likely covered and lengthened by a keratinous material to form a cropping beak for biting off twigs and shoots. Its food gathering would have been aided by its flexible little finger, which could have been used to manipulate objects, unlike the other fingers.|$|E

Some cattle have been observed to have an abnormal gait, changes in behavior, tremors and hyper-responsiveness to certain stimuli. Hindlimb ataxia affects the animal’s gait and occurs when muscle control is lost. This results in poor balance and coordination. Behavioural changes may include aggression, anxiety relating to certain situations, nervousness, frenzy or an overall change in temperament. Some rare but previously observed symptoms also include persistent pacing, rubbing or licking. Additionally, nonspecific symptoms have also been observed which include weight loss, decreased milk production, lameness, ear infections and <b>teeth</b> <b>grinding</b> due to pain. Some animals may show {{a combination of these}} symptoms, while others may only be observed demonstrating one of the many reported.

Background: Estimates of the prevalence of <b>tooth</b> <b>grinding</b> in children range considerably, reflecting different methods of recording. The main aims {{of this study were}} to determine the prevalence of <b>tooth</b> <b>grinding</b> in monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs by assessing wear faceting on the primary canines, and to compare the faceting on the right and left to determine whether children have a side preference for grinding. Methods: The sample consisted of 116 MZ twin pairs and 124 dizygous DZ twin pairs, all participants in an ongoing study of dento-facial development at the dental schools in Adelaide and Melbourne. Evidence of wear faceting on primary maxillary and mandibular canine tips was recorded from dental casts, and the side with the larger wear facet recorded. Types of occlusal relationship, handedness, zygosity and gender were also recorded, and associations between variables analysed statistically. Results: Canine tip wear facets were found in 100 per cent of the sample, and grinding was lateralized in 59 per cent of children. MZ twin pairs showed a higher discordance for grinding side preference than DZ twin pairs (33. 8 per cent compared with 16. 8 per cent), providing evidence of a mirror-imaging effect for grinding side preference. There was no strong evidence that individuals had the same preference for grinding side and handedness, although right-handers (RH) showed a preference for a grinding side more often than non-righthanders (NRH) (63. 6 per cent compared with 51. 2 per cent), consistent with previous findings that RHs display more cerebral lateralization than NRHs. Conclusions: <b>Tooth</b> <b>grinding</b> appears to be a universal phenomenon in children and is commonly expressed more on one side than the other. The significantly higher discordance for grinding side preference in MZ twin pairs compared with DZ twin pairs may reflect a mirror-imaging effect in the former.

The {{aim of the}} present 3 -year longitudinal {{study was to investigate}} the association between a broad collection of biological and behavioural factors and the incidence and progression of erosive tooth wear among adolescents. The study sample consisted of 656 attendees of a dental clinic with at baseline a mean age of 11. 9 years (SD = 0. 9). The criteria for the assessment of erosive wear were a modification of the erosion criteria developed by Lussi [Eur J Oral Sci 1996; 104 : 191 - 198]. Information on biological and behavioural factors was gathered by clinical examinations (at baseline, after 1. 5 and 3 years) and by self-reported questionnaires (completed semi-annually). Of the erosion-free children at baseline, 24. 2 % developed erosive wear. In children with erosion at baseline, 68. 3 % showed progression. Multivariate analyses showed significant associations between the incidence of erosive tooth wear and alcoholic mixed drinks (odds ratio, OR = 1. 82), sour vegetables (OR = 1. 16) and <b>tooth</b> <b>grinding</b> (OR = 4. 03). The intake of yoghurt products was significantly negatively associated with the incidence of erosive wear (OR = 0. 79). The interaction of acidic products and <b>tooth</b> <b>grinding</b> showed a significant extra risk (OR = 1. 2). The intake of vitamins was positively associated with progression (OR = 2. 03).

40|$|AIMS: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that oral parafunctions and symptomatic temporomandibulair joint (TMJ) hypermobility are risk factors in adolescents for both anterior disc displacement with reduction (ADDR) and intermittent locking. METHODS: Participants were two hundred sixty 12 - to 16 -year-old adolescents (52. 3 % female) visiting a university clinic for regular dental care. ADDR and symptomatic TMJ hypermobility were diagnosed using a structured clinical examination. During the anamnesis, reports of intermittent locking and of several parafunctions were noted, eg, nocturnal <b>tooth</b> <b>grinding,</b> diurnal jaw clenching, gum chewing, nail biting, lip and/or cheek biting, and biting on objects. The adolescents' dentitions were examined for opposing matching tooth-wear facets as signs of <b>tooth</b> <b>grinding.</b> Risk factors for ADDR and intermittent locking were first assessed using univariate logistic regression and then entered into a stepwise backward multiple model. RESULTS: While in the multiple model, ADDR was weakly associated only with increasing age (P =. 02, explained variance 8. 1 %), intermittent locking was weakly correlated to diurnal jaw clenching (P =. 05, explained variance 27. 3 %).
