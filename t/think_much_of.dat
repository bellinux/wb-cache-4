However, due to the runaway success of , which was released in February 1927, the producers decided to release The Mountain Eagle three months later on 23 May 1927. The film was reportedly released in the United States as Fear o' God, but the title on the surviving US lobby card seems to contradict this. Film historian J. Larry Kuhns claims that the film was never released under that title.|$|E

Grove concluded the year at Oklahoma City with a 17–7 record, an improvement over the previous season. However, Grove received a knee injury late in the season, which he did not <b>think</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> at the time. In October, Grove injured his other knee when he was involved in an automobile accident in Missouri.|$|E

5|$|The {{son of a}} land surveyor, Boydell apprenticed {{himself to}} William Henry Toms, an artist he admired, and learned engraving. He {{established}} his own business in 1746 and published his first book of engravings around the same time. Boydell did not <b>think</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> his own artistic efforts and eventually started buying the works of others, becoming a print dealer {{as well as an}} artist. He became a successful importer of French prints during the 1750s but was frustrated by their refusal to trade prints in kind. To spark reciprocal trade, he commissioned William Wollett's spectacular engraving of Richard Wilson's The Destruction of the Children of Niobe, which revolutionised the print trade. Ten years later, {{largely as a result of}} Boydell's initiative, the trade imbalance had shifted, and he was named a fellow of the Royal Society for his efforts.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, Nystrom noted of the band's live performances: Well, {{it must be}} hard {{sometimes}} for Jonas to sing his heart out with lyrics referring to personal dark and depressive matters {{and at the same}} time also be accused of being a reluctant frontman. I actually <b>think</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the stuff he sings about doesn't go in hand with running around on stage, throwing horns, smiling and firing up the audience. We're not an energetic power metal band. I think the withdrawn and shy aura actually does more justice to the concept of our songs than going wild, but we have some songs mainly on the two last albums that don't really fall into the doom and gloom category, but are still dark. And there the more aggressive approach fits better.|$|E
25|$|Gilliam {{developed}} {{the story and}} wrote {{the first draft of}} the screenplay with Charles Alverson, who was paid for his work but was ultimately uncredited in the final film. For nearly 20 years, Gilliam denied that Alverson had made any material contribution to the script. But then when the first draft was published and original in-progress documents emerged from Alverson's files, Gilliam begrudgingly changed his story. This was too late for either credit on the film or a listing on the failed Oscar nomination for Alverson. He has said that he would not have minded the Oscar nomination, even though he didn’t <b>think</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the script or the finished film. Gilliam, McKeown, and Stoppard collaborated on further drafts. Brazil was developed under the titles The Ministry and 1984 ½, the latter a nod not only to Orwell's original Nineteen Eighty-Four but also to 8½ by Federico Fellini, a director whom Gilliam often cites as one of the defining influences on his visual style when directing. During the film's production, other working titles floated about, including The Ministry of Torture, How I Learned to Live with the System—So Far, and So That's Why the Bourgeoisie Sucks, before settling with Brazil relating to the name of its escapist signature tune.|$|E

500|$|In 2001, Terry Durack {{reviewed}} the restaurant for The Independent.

He didn't <b>think</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a mustard ice cream in a red cabbage gazpacho soup, but described the restaurant as [...] "great" [...] and gave it a score of seventeen out of twenty. Following the third Michelin star, Jan Moir of The Daily Telegraph visited the restaurant but disliked it, saying that [...] "while many of the flavours are politely interesting, the relentless pappy textures of mousses and foams and creams and poached meats really begins to grate". She also thought the restaurant was overpriced, calling it [...] "The Fat Profit".|$|E
500|$|Part of the behind-the-scenes {{drama of}} this film's {{production}} concerned {{the filming of}} the segments involving Peter Sellers. Screenwriter [...] Wolf Mankowitz declared that Sellers felt intimidated by Orson Welles to the extent that, except {{for a couple of}} shots, neither was in the studio simultaneously. Other versions of the legend depict the drama stemming from Sellers being slighted, in favour of Welles, by Princess Margaret (whom Sellers knew) during her visit to the set. Welles also insisted on performing magic tricks as Le Chiffre, and the director obliged. Director Val Guest wrote that Welles did not <b>think</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> Sellers, and had refused to work with [...] "that amateur". Director Joseph McGrath, a personal friend of Sellers, was punched by the actor when he complained about Sellers' behavior on the set.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{story by}} Michael Halperin contained a different subplot involving {{a problem with}} the dilithium in the warp drive of the Enterprise.

[...] "Lonely Among Us" [...] was subsequently compared to [...] "Journey to Babel", which Fontana denied, saying, [...] "I wrote 'Journey to Babel' and I wrote this too, and I feel there is a difference. There's a definite delineation and separation here, both in intent and content." [...] Director Cliff Bole did not recall much of the episode later, but did not <b>think</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the script, saying [...] "The subject matter affects the end product. There's some better written shows, obviously." [...] It was the first episode of The Next Generation to be directed by Bole, who had previously worked on shows such as V and The Six Million Dollar Man.|$|E

Local activists did not <b>think</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> their chances; a local gay political group invited gays and lesbians in Miami to live in Minneapolis—St. Paul. In an act representing Bryant's diminished national public profile, in October 1977 Bryant {{and her husband were}} in Des Moines, Iowa, discussing an upcoming concert at a press conference when Thom Higgins, an activist affiliated with organizers in Minneapolis, walked up to her in front of cameras and mashed a strawberry rhubarb pie in her face.

500|$|The title La Peau de chagrin first {{appeared}} in print on 9 December 1830, as a passing mention in an article Balzac wrote for La Caricature under the pseudonym Alfred Coudreux. His scrapbook includes the following note, probably written at the same time: [...] "L'invention d'une peau qui représente la vie. Conte oriental." [...] ("The invention of a skin that represents life. Oriental story.") One week later, he published a story fragment called [...] "Le Dernier Napoléon" [...] in La Caricature, under the name [...] "HenriB...". In it, a young man loses his last Napoleon coin at a Parisian gambling house, then continues to the Pont Royal to drown himself. During this early stage, Balzac did not <b>think</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the project. He {{referred to it as}} [...] "a piece of thorough nonsense in the literary sense, but in which [...] has sought to introduce certain of the situations in this hard life through which men of genius have passed before achieving anything".

One day, the prison's stern warden Samuel Norton (Carter) takes a liking to Andy's figurines and offers to sell them so he can take all the money for himself, crippling Bogs (Joe), one of the inmates who had raped Andy in the shower, {{as a sign of}} good will (despite Andy saying that he liked him). Andy is then given permission to clean Norton's office, and, while doing so, plays a record of [...] "Hollaback Girl" [...] across the whole prison, which utterly confuses all the inmates and infuriates Norton, who calls Andy into his office and places him in solitary confinement for two months after Andy indirectly insults him.|$|E
