5|$|The University of Wisconsin Experimental College was a <b>two-year</b> <b>college</b> {{designed}} {{and led by}} Alexander Meiklejohn inside the University of Wisconsin–Madison with a great books, liberal arts curriculum. It was established in 1927 and closed in 1932. Meiklejohn proposed the idea for an alternative college in a 1925 Century magazine article. The magazine's editor-in-chief, Glenn Frank, became the University of Wisconsin's president and invited Meiklejohn to begin the college within the university. Despite pushback from the faculty, the college opened {{in the fall of}} 1927 with a self-governing community of 119 students and less than a dozen faculty. Students followed a uniform curriculum: Periclean Athens for freshmen and modern America for sophomores. The program sought to teach democracy and to foster an intrinsic love of learning within its students.|$|E

CoSIDA has selected Academic All American teams since 1952. To be nominated, a student-athlete {{must be a}} starter or important reserve {{with at least a}} 3.30 cumulative grade point average (on a 4.0 scale) at his/her current institution. Nominated athletes must have participated in at least 50 percent of the team’s games at the position listed on the nomination form (where applicable). No student-athlete is eligible until he has completed one full calendar year at his current institution and has reached sophomore athletic eligibility. In the cases of transfers, graduate students and <b>two-year</b> <b>college</b> graduates, the student-athlete must have completed one full calendar year at the nominating institution to be eligible. Nominees in graduate school must have a cumulative GPA of 3.30 or better both as an undergrad and in grad school.

40|$|During {{the past}} two decades <b>two-year</b> <b>colleges</b> have become an {{increasingly}} important part of the American higher education system, especially for Hispanics who are disproportionately likely to start their careers <b>two-year</b> <b>colleges.</b> Given that today’s economy rewards college attendance more than every before (Bound and Johnson, 1992, 1995) it becomes important to consider the effect that <b>two-year</b> <b>colleges</b> have had on the educational and subsequent labor market futures of Hispanics. Using a sample drawn from the sophomore cohort of the High School and Beyond and we examine the extent to which access to <b>two-year</b> <b>colleges</b> affects both the number of years of postsecondary education completed by Hispanics and the probability of their one-day attaining Bachelor’s degrees. Employing an IV approach to correct for self-selection, we find that <b>two-year</b> <b>colleges</b> have an unambiguously positive effect on the educational attainment of Hispanics. Further, the fact that we estimate a democratization effect for Hispanics that exceeds previous estimates by nearly one full year suggests that Hispanics might disproportionately benefit from access to <b>two-year</b> <b>colleges.</b> JEL classification: I 21, J 15, J 2...|$|R
