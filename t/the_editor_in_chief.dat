25|$|During World War I, Tzigara-Samurcaș irritated Romanian {{public opinion}} by {{accepting}} {{to serve in}} a puppet administration {{set up by the}} Central Powers.

Tzigara was prevented from advancing in his university career over the interwar period, but compensated for this mishap with other achievements: he was a delegate to several world fairs, the first-ever lecturer on Radio Romania's staff, <b>the</b> <b>editor</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief</b> of Convorbiri Literare magazine, and, shortly before retirement, a corresponding member of the Academy. His post-World War II years were spent in obscurity, owing to his ideological incompatibility with the Romanian communist regime.|$|E
