In this autoethnography, I explore the chameleon metaphor for meanings and implications in my personal and professional identity as a female educator by seeking answers to questions stemming from Mitchell and Weber (2005) : <b>Just</b> who do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am? <b>Just</b> who do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am? <b>Just</b> who do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am? <b>Just</b> who do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am? I analyzed my own autobiographical journals using the four-part Listening Guide (Gilligan, Spencer, Weinberg, 2 ̆ 6 Bertsch, 2003) coupled with theme-based family coding to examine changes by choice and changes by force particular to my personal and professional experiences. Notions of home, belonging, and change as a journey emerged as themes that served to frame my identity and highlighted the importance of self-inquiry for educators as an applied practice within the greater context of the profession...|$|R

2500|$|On July 1, 2008, Redden {{signed a}} six-year, $39 million {{contract}} as an unrestricted free agent with the New York Rangers. Redden's performance continued to decline in New York, where he faced considerable criticism — one {{writer for the}} New York Post even called the contract [...] "the worst {{in the history of}} the NHL, if not in the history of hard-cap pro sports." [...] On September 25, 2010, the Rangers placed Redden on waivers in part due to the defenceman's declining play. The move also allowed the Rangers to fit under salary cap. Speaking in 2013 on his stint with the Rangers, Redden said, [...] "I think maybe making that money there and being the player I am… I felt like the first little while, things were going pretty good, and then they kind of fell off. I felt like I wasn’t doing enough, and like I should have been doing more. Once I started feeling that way, I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> got away from the things that made me successful. Things just kind of snowballed from there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cruyff {{was known}} for his {{technical}} ability, speed, acceleration, dribbling and vision, possessing an awareness of his teammates' positions as an attack unfolded. Despite his unimpressive stature and strength, Cruyff's tactical brain and reading of the game were exceptional. “Football consists of different elements: technique, tactics and stamina,” he told the journalists Henk van Dorp and Frits Barend, in one of the interviews collected in their book Ajax, Barcelona, Cruyff. [...] "There are some people who might have better technique than me, and some may be fitter than me, but the main thing is tactics. With most players, tactics are missing. You can divide tactics into insight, trust and daring. In the tactical area, I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> have more than most other players." [...] On the concept of technique in football, Cruyff once said: [...] "Technique is not being able to juggle a ball 1,000 times. Anyone can do that by practising. Then you can work in the circus. Technique is passing the ball with one touch, with the right speed, at the right foot of your team mate." [...] As Van Basten noted, “Johan is so technically perfect that even as a boy he stopped being interested in that aspect of the game. He could do everything when he was 20. That’s why he’s been very interested in tactics since he was very young. He sees football situations so clearly that he was always the one to decide how the game should be played.” In 1997, Dutch journalist Hubert Smeets wrote, [...] "Cruyff was the first player who understood that he was an artist, and the first who was able and willing to collectivise the art of sports." [...] Sports writer David Miller believed Cruyff superior to any previous player in his ability to extract the most from others. He dubbed him [...] "Pythagoras in boots" [...] for the complexity and precision of his passes and wrote, [...] "Few have been able to exact, both physically and mentally, such mesmeric control on a match from one penalty area to another." ...|$|E
