5|$|The {{ship would}} have been faster and larger {{than any of the}} other ships Germany {{intended}} to convert into auxiliary carriers. However, a number of design problems emerged as the drawing up of the conversion plan progressed. Her speed and capacity advantages were offset by several serious practical problems. These included structural weakness, caused by the need <b>to</b> <b>recess</b> the hangar deck into the primary structural deck; instability, normally resolved by adding bulges; and high fuel consumption. Another significant obstacle was the unwillingness of Hermann Göring, the commander in chief of the Luftwaffe, to provide the Kriegsmarine with sufficient aircraft and pilots. By the time the design was completed in November 1942, these problems had proved impossible to rectify, and so the project was abandoned. As a result, no construction work began. After the end of the war, Europa was seized by the US Army and commissioned as a troop transport under the name AP 177 before being transferred to France, where she resumed her commercial duties.|$|E
25|$|Restoration of the {{passenger}} service in 1941 led to provision of electric train token signalling; an intermediate instrument was provided at Brixton Road <b>to</b> <b>recess</b> goods trains there, and a two lever ground frame was provided at Yealmpton. After the second closure, the signalling reverted to one engine in steam on 11 October 1952.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the May 2007 agreement, {{union leaders}} had {{expressed}} concern that its defeat could prompt the National Mediation Board <b>to</b> <b>recess</b> talks indefinitely, resulting {{in the loss of}} a $182million bankruptcy claim the attendants had against Northwest. With the new agreement, the $182million claim was to eventually be sold for cash with an estimated pre-tax value of $15,000 to $18,000 per flight attendant. Other labor unions at Northwest received similar claims as part of their concessionary agreements.|$|E

25|$|A Slide Away Bed {{is a type}} of {{sofa bed}} that slides to the wall to form a sofa. The {{mattress}} is hinged to form a seating surface and back support. The bed frame support is a telescoping frame that allows the bed platform <b>to</b> <b>recess</b> below the seating cushion. The primitive version of the slide away bed was co-invented by Manning Lane, Warren J. Hauck and Roy O. Sweeney of Cincinnati, Ohio. U.S. patent #4,204,287 was filed on September 5, 1978 and issued on May 27, 1980.|$|E
25|$|On July 12, 2006, the {{legislature}} sitting as a constitutional convention voted 100 to 91 to postpone {{action on the}} initiative amendment until November 9, 2006, {{two days after the}} elections. Supporters of same-sex marriage sought the delay, which the amendment's backers denounced and Romney criticized it. As that date neared, Arline Isaacson, a lobbyist for the Gay and Lesbian Political Caucus, was not optimistic about her side's chances and Senate President Robert Travaglini was considering allowing a vote to adjourn without acting on the measure. Instead, on November 9, 2006, the legislators in convention voted 109 to 87 <b>to</b> <b>recess</b> until January 2, {{the last day of the}} legislative session.|$|E
25|$|Slough Fort was {{initially}} armed with seven 7-inch rifled breech loaders (RBLs) positioned in the casemates. It was manned by three officers, one NCO and 75 other ranks. Between October 1889 and December 1891, {{a pair of}} wing batteries were constructed from concrete {{on either side of}} the fort, with a range finder position being added to the fort's roof. The new batteries accommodated two 9.2-inch and two 6-inch breech loaders on disappearing mountings, allowing them <b>to</b> <b>recess</b> below ground level once they had fired. These were much more powerful and longer ranged weapons than the old RBLs and were capable of engaging a battleship at a substantial distance. The old RBLs were removed.|$|E

500|$|MDOT hosted an {{open house}} along the unopened section of [...] M-6 between Kalamazoo and Byron Center avenues. This event took place on October 2, 2004, and was billed as the [...] "Southbelt Shuffle", {{allowing}} the public to walk or bike along the freeway. The event was planned {{to draw attention to}} the M-6 Trail that runs parallel to the freeway. Some event participants brought their horses for the chance to ride on the freeway. The whole freeway was opened to traffic on November 17, 2004, after a ribbon cutting ceremony. When opened, reconstruction work was still being completed on overpass bridges at the I-196 interchange on the west end. The entire project cost $700 million (equivalent to $ in [...] ) to complete over the five-year construction period, about $35million/mi (approximately $22million/km, equivalent to $/mi or $/km in [...] ). When the freeway was opened, it was the first in the state of Michigan to use a SPUI located at the Kalamazoo Avenue exit. All of the bridges and sound barrier walls were painted sienna beige as part of a [...] "color theme" [...] to the freeway. MDOT also used a new technique <b>to</b> <b>recess</b> the pavement markings into the concrete, designed to reduce the likelihood that snowplows would scrape them off. The signs are in miles, but [...] "the entire M-6 freeway was designed and constructed in metric", according to MDOT manager Suzette Peplinski. The final ramps opened to traffic on December 9, 2004.|$|E
2500|$|The move {{came after}} Republican whip Tom Libous {{introduced}} a surprise resolution to vacate {{the chair and}} replace Smith as temporary president and majority leader. In an effort to stop the vote, Democratic whip Jeff Klein (Bronx) unilaterally moved <b>to</b> <b>recess,</b> and Smith had the lights and Internet cut off. [...] However, {{they were unable to}} stop the session. All 30 Republicans plus two Democrats, Monserrate and Espada, voted in favor of the resolution. In accordance with a prearranged deal, Espada was elected temporary president and acting lieutenant governor while Skelos was elected majority leader. Both Monserrate and Espada were members of the original [...] "Gang of Four" [...] (the other two being Díaz, Sr. and Kruger), a group of Democratic senators that threatened to defect to the Republican caucus to prevent Smith from taking control of the chamber in January 2009. Monserrate had backed out of the Gang at the time, being the first of the four to back Smith.|$|E
2500|$|Cornwall was {{an attempt}} to avoid the {{damaging}} long wheelbase of the Cramptons, whilst still permitting large driving wheels. By moving the driving axle ahead of the firebox, one of the carrying axles could be moved backwards, giving a shorter overall wheelbase. The difficulty of how to fit the axles past the boiler recurred, to which Trevithick provided an [...] "extremely complicated" [...] solution. The boiler was placed entirely underneath the driving axle. Even then, it was necessary <b>to</b> <b>recess</b> a transverse channel {{across the top of the}} boiler, so as to provide clearance for the driving axle. The trailing carrying axle passed through a crosswise tube through the middle of the firebox. This made assembly difficult, but as it was only a straight carrying axle rather than a cranked driving axle, the tube diameter required was manageable. This use of a cross-firebox axle tube was part of Crampton's patent of 1842. As completed in 1847, and first numbered 173, Cornwall was a 4-2-2 with 8'6" [...] drivers, paired leading wheels of 3'6", single trailing wheels of 4' and an overall wheelbase of 16'6". This is the condition in which she was exhibited at The Great Exhibition of 1851.|$|E

2500|$|A {{series of}} {{maneuvers}} followed. [...] Dynegy executives said {{the offer was}} a good one, as the deal would give Dynegy access to lines of credit which would enable it to refinance and restructure its debt. [...] With energy prices at cyclical lows, {{the company said it}} lacked the resources to do so and that its debt burden was destabilizing. [...] Blackstone Group initially said it would not offer more than US$4.50 per share, but then revised its offer later that day to US$5.00 a share. Worried that it did not have enough shareholder support to accept the Blackstone Group offer, Dynegy proposed postponing its shareholder meeting a few days to November 23, but postponement did not occur. Legal counsel advised that Delaware law (under which Dynegy was incorporated) considered a postponement a new meeting, and that would require notifying shareholders (again) and giving at least 20 days' notice. [...] Furthermore, Dynegy's proxy rules did not make it clear that a proxy remained in effect {{in the event of a}} postponement (which could lead to lawsuits). [...] Legal counsel also believed that Dynegy management would be forced refile resolution with shareholders and resolicit votes, which would delay a meeting until early 2011. During the shareholder meeting, management's fears proved accurate. [...] On November 19, Dynegy was forced <b>to</b> <b>recess</b> its shareholder meeting in an attempt to garner more support for the Blackstone bid. (Dynegy was unable to adjourn the meeting because its bylaws did not clearly provide for adjournment to another date, and because it was unclear that adjournment could occur without a shareholder vote—a vote the board felt it would lose.) During the four-day recess, Dynegy executives said the company would continue to solicit a takeover even if the Blackstone Group bid failed. On November 23, 2010, Dynegy management and Blackstone agreed to call off the takeover after it became clear there was not enough support for the US$5.00 a share bid.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the conference}} convened Kühlmann asked Joffe {{to present the}} Russian {{conditions}} for peace. [...] He made six points, all variations of the Bolshevik slogan of peace with [...] "no annexations or indemnities". [...] The Central Powers accepted these principles [...] "but only in case all belligerents [...] without exception pledge themselves to do the same". [...] They {{did not intend to}} annex territories occupied by force. [...] Joffe telegraphed this marvelous news to Petrograd. [...] Thanks to informal chatting in the mess, one of Hoffmann's aides, Colonel Friedrich Brinckmann, realized that the Russians had optimistically misinterpreted the Central Power's meaning. [...] It fell to Hoffmann to set matters straight at dinner on 27 December: [...] Poland, Lithuania and Courland, already occupied by the Central Powers, were determined to separate from Russia, on the principle of self-determination that the Bolsheviks themselves espoused. [...] Joffe [...] "looked as if he had received a blow on the head". [...] Pokrovsky wept as he asked how they could speak of [...] "peace without annexations when Germany was tearing eighteen provinces away from the Russian state". [...] The Germans and Austro-Hungarian planned to annex slices of Polish territory and to to set up a rump Polish state with what remained, [...] while the Baltic provinces were to become [...] client states ruled by German princes. Czernin was beside himself with this hitch that was slowing the negotiations; self-determination was anathema to his government and they urgently needed grain from the east because Vienna {{was on the verge of}} starvation. [...] He proposed to make a separate peace. [...] Kühlmann warned that if they negotiated separately Germany would immediately withdraw all its divisions from the Austrian front; Czernin dropped [...] that threat. The food crisis in Vienna was eventually eased by [...] "forced drafts of grain from Hungary, Poland, and Romania and by a last moment contribution from Germany of 450 truck-loads of flour", [...] At the Russian request they agreed <b>to</b> <b>recess</b> the talks for twelve days.|$|E
6000|$|But not as {{regarded}} himself, for {{although the}} new pupil had accepted his instructions with childlike submissiveness, {{and even as}} {{it seemed to him}} with childlike comprehension, he could not help noticing that she occasionally glanced at him with a demure suggestion of some understanding between them, or as if they were playing at master and pupil. This naturally annoyed him and perhaps added a severer dignity to his manner, which {{did not appear to be}} effective, however, and which he fancied secretly amused her. Was she covertly laughing at him? Yet against this, once or twice, as her big eyes wandered from her task over the room, they encountered the curious gaze of the other children, and he fancied he saw an exchange of that freemasonry of intelligence common to children in the presence of their elders even when strangers to each other. He looked forward <b>to</b> <b>recess</b> to see how she would get on with her companions; he knew that this would settle her status in the school, and perhaps elsewhere. Even her limited English vocabulary would not in any way affect that instinctive, childlike test of superiority, but he was surprised when the hour of recess came and he had explained to her in Spanish and English its purpose, to see her quietly put her arm around the waist of Matilda Bromly, the tallest girl in the school, as the two whisked themselves off to the playground. She was a mere child after all! ...|$|E

50|$|After Benedict leaves, Prickly relates how, back in {{the spring}} of 1968, Benedict became {{principal}} of Third Street School and moved <b>to</b> abolish <b>recess</b> <b>to</b> improve test grades. Prickly then revealed that the plan obviously didn't go over well as it was met with angry parents protesting to Benedict <b>to</b> reinstate <b>recess</b> which he refused to do. Prickly went to the superintendent as a means of recourse. While the superintendent assured the parents that the plan Benedict made would never be carried out, Benedict still refused to back down. The superintendent then demoted Benedict and promoted Prickly to principal. Benedict jumped to the conclusion that Prickly threw him under the bus to take his job, which, along with his anti-recess views, caused his then-girlfriend, Muriel P. Finster to break up with him. Infuriated, Benedict ended his friendship with Prickly, quit teaching, and swore revenge on his now-former friend. Later, Prickly says, Benedict went on to become Secretary of Education but was fired by the president when he tried <b>to</b> abolish <b>recess</b> nationwide.|$|R
