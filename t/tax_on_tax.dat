40|$|The Tax Reform Act of 1976 was {{the most}} {{significant}} amendment of the Internal Revenue Code since its major overhaul in 1954. The Act dealt {{with a wide variety}} of income, gift, and estate tax matters with particular emphasis on tax shelter arrangements. Most of the provisions of the Act require successive readings and reference to the legislative history to understand them. A greater difficulty arises in interpreting the Act from its incidental or secondary effects. The Act clearly has an effect on Code provisions and business transactions not anticipated by Congress. Thus, new and complex tax traps have been created that must be identified, analyzed and subjected to the scrutiny of tax planners. The purpose of this Commentary is to identify five major potential tax traps that stem from the Act, so practitioners may analyze and hopefully avoid these particular pitfalls. These potential traps are in the following areas: (1) corporate buy/sell agreements; (2) lump sum distributions from pension plans; (3) subchapter S elections; (4) minimum <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>tax</b> preference items; and (5) preferred stock bailouts...|$|E

This paper attempts a return on equity fiscal general vision as a principle often invoked and used to justify tax policies, but so often violated the laws fiscality. Also want to emphasize the importance of devising procedures to ensure fiscal equitable treatment of taxpayers. Specific approach of this paper is based on the notion that tax equity is based on equality before tax and social policies of the executive that would be more effective than using the other tax instruments. I want to emphasize that if the scientific approach to justify the unequal treatment of the tax law is based on the various social problems of the taxpayers, then deviates from the issue of tax fairness justification explaining the need to promote social policies usually more attractive to taxpayers. Modern tax techniques are believed to be promoted especially in order to ensure an increasing level of high efficiency {{at the expense of the}} taxpayers obligations to ensure equality before the law tax. On the other hand, tax inequities reaction generates multiple recipients from the first budget plan, but finalities unfair measures can not quantify and no timeline for the reaction, usually not known.
