5|$|Important for the {{adoption}} of the style {{in the early nineteenth century}} was Abbotsford House, the residence of the novelist and poet, Sir Walter Scott. Re-built for him from 1816, it became a model for the modern revival of the baronial style. Common features borrowed from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century houses included battlemented gateways, crow-stepped gables, pointed turrets and machicolations. The style was popular across Scotland and was applied to relatively modest dwellings by architects such as William Burn (1789–1870), David Bryce (1803–76), Edward Blore (1787–1879), Edward Calvert (c. 1847–1914) and Robert Stodart Lorimer (1864–1929). The publication of Robert Billings' Baronial and Ecclesiastical Architecture of Scotland (1848–52) provided a handbook for the style and the rebuilding of Balmoral Castle as a baronial palace (and subsequent adoption as a royal retreat from 1855–58) confirmed its popularity. Estate house building boomed between about 1855 and the agricultural depression and Glasgow Bank crash of 1878. Construction was now dominated by patronage from nouveau riche industrialists. The decline in numbers of servants, linked to the introduction of electricity, central heating and labour-saving devices such as <b>the</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner,</b> also led to changes in the scale of building. Arts and crafts designs first featured in Philip Webb's (1831–1915) gothic design at Arisaig (1863–64). It was pursed by William Lethaby at Melsetter House, Hoy (1898) for a Birmingham industrialist.|$|E

When passing the narrow slit of the nozzle the air stream is accelerated and blown against the sieve mesh, dispersing the particles.

25|$|Bed bugs occur {{around the}} world. Rates of infestations in {{developed}} countries, while decreasing from the 1930s to the 1980s, have increased dramatically since the 1980s. Previous to this they were {{common in the}} developing world but rare in the developed world. The increase in the developed world may have been caused by increased international travel, resistance to insecticides, and the use of new pest-control methods that do not affect bed bugs. The fall in bed bug populations after the 1930s in the developed world is believed to be partly due to the usage of DDT to kill cockroaches. The invention of <b>the</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> and simplification of furniture design may have also played a role. Others believe it might simply be the cyclical nature of the organism.|$|E
25|$|Result: Both teams {{wanted a}} {{designer}} shopping trolley, but Kinetic won it after Lewis unwittingly sabotaged Atomic's pitch by asking irrelevant questions and behaving in an unprofessional manner. Kinetic therefore got the trolley and a handheld vacuum cleaner, while Atomic chose a pie making machine and a bird {{house with a}} built-in camera (Harry M. and Hayley wanted an inflatable support pillow, but Haya ignored them). Both teams struggled to sell {{in the first half}} of the day, and had to resort to cutting prices as the day went on. The standout performers were Harry H. and Lizzie on Kinetic, who overcame their lack of a discount with very effective product demonstrations of <b>the</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner,</b> and Harry M. on Atomic, who single-handedly made almost half of his team's revenue by selling five bird boxes at the end of the day. Kinetic won out with a profit of £1,138.77, largely due to Harry H. and Lizzie's work with the vacuum cleaners, while Atomic suffered their fourth successive defeat, raising just £847.42.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{evidence}} and CCTV {{footage of the}} fire showed that it probably started towards {{the stern of the}} ship on the lower deck. All electrical equipment on board was examined and it was determined that an industrial vacuum cleaner in this area was normally running continuously to suck up dust and particles from work going on to break up concrete within the ship. No one working on the ship had responsibility to ensure all equipment was turned off {{at the end of each}} day, and no one recalled switching off the equipment on the Friday in question. <b>The</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> has three motors inside and after the fire one was found to be burned out in a manner which suggested it had failed while operating. This was not conclusive evidence, however, because the motor might previously have failed in service without causing a fire, and gone unnoticed because the other two motors had continued to function. Tests on similar cleaners showed they had no thermal cutout devices and while they could run safely indefinitely if filters inside were clear, if the airflow through the cleaner was blocked then it would eventually overheat and could catch fire. This might occur if the cleaner were full of dust and debris. The cleaner had failed previously and two motors had been replaced.|$|E
25|$|A <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> uses {{a partial}} vacuum to suck up dust and dirt, usually from floors. Daniel Hess of West Union, Iowa, invented <b>the</b> first <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> in 1860. Calling it a carpet sweeper {{instead of a}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner,</b> his machine did, in fact, have a {{rotating}} brush like a traditional <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> which also possessed an elaborate bellows mechanism {{on top of the}} body to generate suction of dust and dirt. Hess received a patent (U.S. patent #29,077) for his invention of <b>the</b> first <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> on July 10, 1860. Despite credit usually going to English inventor Hubert Cecil Booth for inventing <b>the</b> first electric <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> in 1901, his vacuum was actually predated two years by an American, John Thurman of St. Louis, Missouri, who invented <b>the</b> motorized <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> in 1899. However, neither were practical or useful. The first practical and portable <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> was built in 1907, when James Murray Spangler, a janitor from Canton, Ohio, incorporated a rotating brush, an electric fan, a box, and one of his wife's pillowcases to serve as the dust bag.|$|R

25|$|Elton (Joe Cushley) - Mrs Dribelle's dim-witted sidekick. He is a hardman {{who always}} wears a woolly hat with badges and a denim jacket. He knows that Bodger has a badger {{in the flat}} after Badger hits {{him on the head}} with a frying pan. He is {{incredibly}} stupid and is always trying to prove to Mrs Dribelle that there is a badger in the flat by all means possible, but he never succeeds. In one episode he dressed up as Mrs Dribelle's mother to trick Simon into believing Mrs Dribelle had nowhere to live, so that she could get Simon {{to move out of the}} flat. However Badger, who could see Elton's underpants underneath his skirt, knew it was Elton so he tried to show Simon the underpants. First he pulled the lever when Elton was sitting on the bed which made the bed go back, but it still did not work so Badger thought of another way to show Simon the underpants by turning <b>the</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> on, which sucked up the skirt Elton was wearing. Simon then saw the underpants and realised it was Elton. Even though Mrs Dribelle features in Series 7, Elton did not feature after Series 6. He was last seen in the episode 'Badger's Party' where he was attacked by children who were St John Badger Scouts.|$|E
500|$|Set in {{the year}} 2099, the series depicts the Earth as very {{different}} from today. Following a number of environmental disasters, such as [...] "the Withering" [...] {{which resulted in the}} loss of a great deal of human knowledge including <b>the</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> and fire (although the latter came back fairly quickly) [...] and a [...] "Cattle-clasm" [...] that killed off most of the livestock, the Earth has been reduced to a wasteland separated between [...] "Withered Zones" [...] and the remaining inhabitable areas. The Withering shifted the Earth into a new orbit, resulting in disruption to the seasons and a reformed calendar. Every day of the week is now 25-hours long except for Thursday (which, due to time anomalies, has not occurred in over a decade), while the change in the length of the year {{led to the creation of}} new months such as Janril, Febtober, and Marchuary. In addition, the dreary season of Hamble was created, which is permanently dark, cold and drizzly. The Withering resulted in vegetarians, pigeons and gays becoming endangered species, and completely wiped out tarts.|$|E

At 12:53pm, when Kampusch was {{cleaning}} and vacuuming her kidnapper's BMW 850i automobile in the garden, someone called Přiklopil on his mobile phone. Because of the vacuuming noise, {{he walked away}} to take the call. Kampusch left <b>the</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> running and ran away, unseen by Přiklopil, who, according to the caller, completed the phone call without any sign of being disturbed or distracted. Kampusch ran for some 200metres through gardens and a street, jumping fences, and asking passers-by to call the police, but they paid her no attention. After about five minutes, she knocked on {{the window of a}} 71-year-old neighbour known as Inge T, saying, [...] "I am Natascha Kampusch". The neighbour called the police, who arrived at 1:04pm.

Andrews needed parts to repair a broken vacuum cleaner, so he went to the O.K. Vacuum repair shop co-owned by Rusty Wallace's father and uncle. Gary Wallace, Rusty's uncle, had a conversation with Andrews about vacuum cleaners and other topics. Gary Wallace offered Andrews a job. Andrews helped move <b>the</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> repair shop to a larger facility. Andrews worked closely with Rusty Wallace and the two got to know each other well.
