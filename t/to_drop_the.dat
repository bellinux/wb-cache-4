5|$|In 1882, the team's decline continued, and the {{pitchers}} began to complain of exhaustion and accused management of overuse.

However, the agreement also included fixing production quotas and fining members who produced more than their quota. The members of what was in effect a cartel were forced <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>the</b> quota agreement by the EU.|$|E
