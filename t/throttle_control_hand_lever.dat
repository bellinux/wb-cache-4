50|$|The Topper had 5 inch {{internal}} expanding {{drum brakes}} on both wheels. The front brake was <b>controlled</b> by a <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> {{on the left}} handlebar with a parking brake lock; the rear brake was controlled by a pedal.|$|R
50|$|These {{controls}} vary {{in scope}} and design between different types of cars. They may also be located and operated differently in other road vehicles such as motorcycles, where the <b>throttle</b> is <b>controlled</b> by a <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> and the gear shift is operated by a pedal. Some types of vehicle controls are found in rail vehicles. For example, some trams and light rail vehicles like the PCC streetcar use automobile-style pedals to control the speed.|$|R

50|$|Many {{semaphore}} signals were formerly used, which were <b>controlled</b> by a <b>hand</b> <b>lever.</b> Few semaphores remain in Japan. On 28 July 2005, the last {{semaphore signals}} on the JR lines at Rikuchū-Yagi Station {{were replaced by}} colored lights. A few stations are still equipped with semaphore signals on the Tsugaru Railway Line, the Fukushima Rinkai Railway Main Line and the Niigata-Higashi industrial line.|$|R
50|$|At a {{time when}} most hang gliders used a {{flexible}} Rogallo wing, Icarus I used a rigid flying wing biplane configuration. Unlike other hang gliders of the time, the Icarus was not steered by the pilot shifting his body weight. Instead, Icarus I had two large rudders mounted near the wing tips, <b>controlled</b> by <b>hand</b> <b>levers.</b> These rudders made Icarus I much more maneuverable than other hang gliders. Pitch was controlled by the pilot shifting his body weight fore and aft. The pilot flew in a reclining position, rather than the prone position used by other hang gliders.|$|R
5000|$|Under the {{designation}} 10 HP Type A {{the car had}} a water-cooled 1327 cc four-cylinder engine and an output of [...] Its maximum speed was 65 km/h (40 mph). The chassis had inverted quarter elliptic springs at the front and double quarter elliptics at the rear. Braking was on the rear wheels only <b>controlled</b> by a <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> with a foot pedal operated transmission brake.|$|R
50|$|In {{common with}} most Manx stations, it never had full sized platforms, {{but there were}} half-height ones {{reaching}} {{as far as the}} bottom running board of the coaches. On {{the south side of the}} main platform there was also a long bay platform. In common with most of the island's railway system points and signals were not fully interlocked, but <b>controlled</b> by individual <b>hand</b> <b>levers.</b> Therefore, there was no signal box or groundframe.|$|R
50|$|The Tatra T5C5 is a single-car tram {{built by}} ČKD Tatra in Prague {{in the late}} 1970s and early 1980s. In 1978, two prototypes were tested in Prague and Budapest. They {{differed}} in many ways to earlier Tatra products, most notably that the vehicle was <b>controlled</b> by a <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> rather than a foot pedal. Between 1978 and 1984, 322 vehicles were supplied to Budapest and, as of March 2014, 240 units are still in service.|$|R
50|$|The Points Box {{remained}} in use until {{the summer of}} 1970 when the point work of the Port Erin arrival platform and its associated signals were disconnected. These points were then <b>controlled</b> with <b>hand</b> <b>levers</b> and the signals were placed permanently in the 'off' position so that trains could arrive and depart without the box being manned, saving the associated wage costs. Thereafter, it was used only for more complicated shunting movements in which case it would be manned {{by a member of}} the train crew or the stationmaster. The remainder was taken out of use in 1979/80 when the old Port Erin Platforms - 5 & 6 - were removed and the area cleared for parking.|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} types of chassis: the C, which was also used for the C2, and the C3. They varied in length with the {{original}} Type C/C2 measuring 2.25 m in length, and the 1925 C3 measuring 2.35 m. The suspension used inverted quarter elliptic springs at the front and rear, braking was on the rear wheels only, <b>controlled</b> by a <b>hand</b> <b>lever,</b> and on the transmission by the foot brake. The maximum speed was 60 km/h with a fuel consumption of 5 l/100 km.|$|R
2500|$|The WC, {{with many}} good {{features}} and various first-to-market attributes, {{had at least}} a few drawbacks. Its clutch was not particularly well designed, and, like other tractors of the 1920s through mid-1930s, it lacked usability in the design of its brake <b>controls,</b> with a <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> {{on each side of the}} tractor, which meant that applying the brakes took the operator's hands away from other controls. Other tractors had foot pedals on both sides, but that meant that the clutch and left brake could not be operated simultaneously. The solution came in the late 30s, when [...] various brands moved both brake pedals to the right foot.|$|R
5000|$|The T engine had one {{carburetor}}, a side-draft, single-venturi unit. Its choke and <b>throttle</b> valves were <b>controlled</b> manually; {{the latter}} was with a <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> rather than a foot pedal. The carburetor had no accelerator pump. Various vendors supplied Ford with carburetors for the T engine, including Holley, Zenith, and Kingston.|$|R
5000|$|The Lincoln LS {{received}} its first, and only, major refresh for 2003, coinciding with Lincoln's then-new [...] "Travel Well" [...] ad campaign. The exterior received a slight facelift, with HID headlamps (optional), and a revised trunklid with new taillights. For the powertrains, both available engines received {{a boost in}} power and torque, as well as slightly improved fuel efficiency. The 3.0 L DOHC V6 with which the LS was introduced now featured continuously variable intake cam timing, improved variable-length intake runners, and electronic [...] "drive-by-wire" [...] <b>throttle</b> <b>control</b> (which replaced the traditional mechanical cable-linked <b>throttle</b> <b>control</b> system used previously). The optional 3.9 L DOHC V8 with which the LS was also introduced received variable exhaust-valve timing. Due to its upgraded design, the 3.9 L V8 now produced over 87% of its peak torque output at only 2000 rpm and cars equipped with the V8 could now accelerate from zero to 60 mi/h km/h in around 6.5 seconds. Other notable additions to the LS included an electronic push-button parking brake (similar {{to that of the}} BMW E65 7 Series), replacing the traditional center console-mounted <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> (or foot pedal), a touch-screen DVD satellite navigation map system, and an industry-first, 10-speaker THX-certified sound system. LSE versions were also available in the 2004 and 2005 model years, with unique fasciae, unique 17-inch wheels, all-red tail lights, a color-keyed grille, unique floormats, and additional wood paneling in the interior.|$|R

50|$|The Powerplus had twist grips on both handles; the <b>throttle</b> was <b>controlled</b> by {{the left}} twist grip while the right twist grip {{advanced}} or retarded the spark.

50|$|Usually, the <b>throttle</b> valve is <b>controlled</b> with a <b>throttle</b> pedal or lever via {{a direct}} {{mechanical}} linkage. In vehicles with electronic <b>throttle</b> <b>control,</b> the manual <b>throttle</b> <b>control</b> sends {{a signal to}} the Engine Control Unit (ECU), which then directly controls the position of the throttle valve. This means that the operator does not have direct <b>control</b> over the <b>throttle</b> valve; the ECU can finely control the valve in order to reduce emissions or maximize performance.|$|R

50|$|Early cars {{such as the}} Ford Model T had a <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> to <b>control</b> the <b>{{throttle}}.</b> Later cars {{used both}} a foot pedal and a <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> to set the minimum throttle. This was an early form of cruise control. The 1918 Stutz Bearcat had a central throttle pedal with the clutch and brake {{to the right and}} left. Modern cruise control was invented in 1948.|$|R

50|$|The {{benefits}} of electronic <b>throttle</b> <b>control</b> are largely unnoticed by most drivers because {{the aim is}} to make the vehicle power-train characteristics seamlessly consistent irrespective of prevailing conditions, such as engine temperature, altitude, and accessory loads. Electronic <b>throttle</b> <b>control</b> is also working 'behind the scenes' to dramatically improve the ease with which the driver can execute gear changes and deal with the dramatic torque changes associated with rapid accelerations and decelerations.|$|R
