5|$|The jetty {{facilities}} used two cranes to offload coal, {{with the capacity}} of unloading two ships at one time, {{at a rate of}} 480 tonnes an hour. Coal was also delivered by rail to the east of the station using the Brighton Main Line which passes near the site. Coal was usually delivered to the jetty, rather than by rail. A conveyor belt system was then used to take coal to the coal storage area or directly to the station's boiler rooms. The conveyor belt system consisted of a series of bridges connected by towers. The coal storage area was a large concrete box capable of holding 75,000 tonnes of coal. This had an overhead gantry with a conveyor belt attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt system, for taking coal from the coal store to the boiler rooms.|$|E
500|$|Mitchell and Rockwell had {{previously}} collaborated on Hairspray, Catch Me If You Can and Legally Blonde. [...] Mitchell told The New York Times that the [...] "Everybody Say Yeah" [...] scene, {{in which the}} cast celebrates {{the creation of the}} first pair of Kinky Boots with a choreographed celebration on conveyor belts, required repeated innovations and adjustments like the eventual addition of safety rails and actor controls for the apparatus. Designer Derek McLane commented that {{it is not uncommon for}} repeat choreographer/set designer collaborations to result in intriguing innovation like the conveyor belt dance scene in Kinky Boots. McLane was impressed with the [...] "series of conveyor belts that came apart, moved around, and fit the context of the story" [...] in order to accentuate the choreography of [...] "a troupe of men in four-inch heels". With respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conveyor</b> belts, he said, [...] "They've never been used as dynamically as this, creating a series of surprises, with the kind of wild athleticism that actually looks dangerous. It's one of the more thrilling combinations of stage design and choreography that I can recall." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{electrical}} power industry had high productivity growth.

2500|$|The lake {{has been}} a [...] "bustling thoroughfare" [...] for {{maritime}} vessels for centuries. Ships headed eastward can take the Welland Canal {{and a series of}} eight locks descending [...] to Lake Ontario which takes about 12 hours, according to one source. Thousands of ships make this journey each year. During the 19th century, ships could enter the Buffalo River and travel the Erie Canal eastward to Albany then south to New York City along the Hudson River. Generally there is heavy traffic on the lake except during the winter months from January through March when ice prevents vessels from traveling safely. In 2007, there was a protest against Ontario's energy policy which allows the shipping of coal in the lake; GreenPeace activists climbed a ladder on a freighter and [...] "locked themselves <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt device that helps to unload the ship's cargo"; three activists were arrested and the ship was delayed for more than four hours, and anti-coal messages were painted on the ship.|$|E
2500|$|Longwall mining {{accounts}} for about 50 percent of underground production. The longwall shearer has a face of [...] or more. It is a sophisticated machine with a rotating drum that moves mechanically {{back and forth across}} a wide coal seam. The loosened coal falls onto an armored chain conveyor or pan line that takes the coal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt for removal from the work area. Longwall systems have their own hydraulic roof supports which advance with the machine as mining progresses. As the longwall mining equipment moves forward, overlying rock that is no longer supported by coal is allowed to fall behind the operation in a controlled manner. The supports make possible high levels of production and safety. Sensors detect how much coal remains in the seam while robotic controls enhance efficiency. Longwall systems allow a 60-to-100 percent coal recovery rate when surrounding geology allows their use. Once the coal is removed, usually 75 percent of the section, the roof is allowed to collapse in a safe manner.|$|E
50|$|Externally mounted {{monitoring}} {{technologies are}} also being investigated by the industry. Largely showing mixed results of success, these proposed technologies are mostly research based initiatives. A complexity arises out of detecting specific failing rollers using generalised monitoring technologies such as optic fibre cables or vibration monitoring transducers mounted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conveyor</b> frame. The general, non-specific nature of these technologies have many issues similar to those encountered with the traditional monitoring aids used by inspection personnel. Acoustic monitors, Infrared cameras and any other technology that does not monitor the rollers in a holistic way, generally fail to accurately predict impending roller failure. This is because conveyor roller failure is multi-modal and is indicated over a variety of failure signals not solely identified using single mode detection systems which are characteristic of optic fibre or vibration transducers mounted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conveyor</b> structure.|$|E
50|$|By using {{different}} plant component, {{it is largely}} possible <b>to</b> adapt <b>the</b> <b>conveyor</b> arrangement <b>to</b> local conditions, i.e. one plant can be arranged at various operating levels.

Change in position can be effected horizontally and or/ vertically by tube bends and /or deflection stations.|$|R
50|$|A {{warehouse}} management system usually represents the central unit in the software structure of a warehouse.

50|$|Overrunning {{occurs when}} {{two or more}} motors can be used <b>to</b> drive <b>the</b> same machine, {{including}} through the same shaft. A typical setup is as follows. The service drive, or prime mover, provides a combination of high speed and high power for normal operation. The secondary drive, or pony drive, can be run at low speed and low power, usually <b>to</b> position <b>the</b> <b>conveyor</b> for maintenance.|$|R

40|$|Today {{much higher}} speed of {{operation}} and highly accurate weighing of packages during crossing a conveyor belt has been {{getting more and more}} important in the food and distribution industries etc. Continuous weighing means that masses of discrete packages on a conveyor belt are automatically determined in sequence. Making the best use of new weighing scale called a multi-stage conveyor belt scale which can be created so as <b>to</b> adjust <b>the</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt length <b>to</b> <b>the</b> product length, we propose a simplified and effective mass estimation algorithm under practical vibration modes. Conveyor belt scales usually have maximum capacities of less than 80 kg and 140 cm, and achieve measuring rates of 150 packages per minute and more. The output signals from <b>the</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt scales are always contaminated with noises due <b>to</b> vibrations of <b>the</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt and <b>the</b> product in motion. In this paper an employed digital filter is of Finite-duration Impulse Response (FIR) type designed under the consideration on <b>the</b> dynamics of <b>conveyor</b> belt scales. <b>The</b> experimental results on conveyor belt scales suggest that the filtering algorithm proposed here is effective enough to practical applications. 1...|$|R

40|$|Belt {{conveyors}} play {{an important}} role in continuous dry bulk material transport, especially at the mining industry. Speed control is expected <b>to</b> reduce <b>the</b> energy consumption of belt conveyors. Transient operation is the operation of increasing or decreasing conveyor speed for speed control.
