5|$|Mehldau has {{expressed}} an interest in, and knowledge of, philosophy and literature. In a 2003 interview he commented on romanticism and nostalgia, linking pleasure and pain to musical expression: I love {{the part of the}} Orpheus myth where he is allowed to take his wife out of Hades on the condition that he doesn't look back at her for the trip on the river Styx. When he can't help himself, he looks back, and she is pulled back downstream away from him, taken away forever. Music is that moment right when he looks at her: seeing something that you love for an instant being taken away forever. There's an element of folly to the whole thing – you look even though you know you shouldn't. Music kind of yokes together <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> attainment and <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> loss at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Parts of {{the pain}} {{sensation}} and processing system may not function properly; creating <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> pain when no outside cause exists, signaling too much pain from a particular cause, or signaling pain from a normally non-painful event. Additionally, the pain modulation mechanisms may not function properly. These phenomena are involved in chronic pain.|$|E
60|$|No {{man ever}} doubted that the {{commodity}} of tea could bear an imposition of threepence. But no commodity will bear threepence, or will bear a penny, when <b>the</b> general <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> men are irritated, and two {{millions of people}} are resolved not to pay. <b>The</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colonies were formerly <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> Great Britain. Theirs were formerly <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> Mr. Hampden when called upon for the payment of twenty shillings. Would twenty shillings have ruined Mr. Hampden's fortune? No! but the payment of half twenty shillings, on the principle it was demanded, would have made him a slave.|$|R
5000|$|Emotion Interpretation - an {{individual}} may perceive an agent as feeling a particular emotion and react with complementary or situationally appropriate emotions <b>of</b> their own. <b>The</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> others diverge from {{and in some}} way compliment <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original agent.|$|R
50|$|Many {{instances}} of interpersonal emotion regulation, {{such as those}} described above, are dyadic; in other words, they involve one person trying to influence <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> another person. However, interpersonal emotion regulation can occur between larger social groups. For example, in the workplace a leader might try to influence <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> {{a whole group of}} followers to make them feel more enthusiastic and motivated. Or in support groups, the whole group might work together to influence <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> a member to make the member feel less anxious or depressed.|$|R
5|$|The strict {{sense of}} values and <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> devotion to a cause, which became so {{characteristic}} of him in later life, were derived, in part at least, from the instruction imparted so zealously and unquestioningly inside the severely unadorned walls of the Baptist Church at Otterville.|$|E
5|$|Bashō was {{introduced}} to poetry at a young age, and after integrating himself into the intellectual scene of Edo (modern Tokyo) he quickly became well known throughout Japan. He made {{a living as a}} teacher; but then renounced the social, urban life of the literary circles and was inclined to wander throughout the country, heading west, east, and far into the northern wilderness to gain inspiration for his writing. His poems were influenced by his firsthand experience of the world around him, often encapsulating <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> a scene in a few simple elements.|$|E
5|$|Do I wish I {{had never}} endured post-partum depression? Absolutely. But {{to deny the}} {{experience}} is to deny who I am. I still mourn the loss of what could have been, but I also feel deep gratitude for those who stood by me, for the lesson that we must never be afraid to ask for help, and for <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> summer that still remains.|$|E

40|$|To {{examine a}} model <b>of</b> {{relationships}} between <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> gratitude and prosocial motivation in adolescents, {{a survey of}} 414 second grade {{of high school students}} and 191 undergraduate students in Thailand was conducted using a multi-aspect questionnaire about gratitude. The questionnaire measured the following items involved in hypothetical helping situations: (a) perception on gains for a recipient, cost of a benefactor, desirability of the favor, and obligation to give help as cognitive variables affecting <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> gratitude; (b) <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> gratitude which include <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> appreciativeness, indebtedness, and general positive; and (c) enhancement of prosocial motivation on recipients as a consequence of gratitude. Results indicated that, in high school and undergraduate students, appreciativeness is <b>the</b> only <b>feeling</b> that showed positive correlation to the enhancement of prosocial motivation, whereas the perception on the cost of a benefactor and the gain of a recipient showed positive correlation to <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> appreciativeness. In addition, both groups of students reported more degree <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> appreciativeness and enhancement of the prosocial motivation when regarding their father and mother’s help rather than that of friends. It is also discussed that <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> appreciativeness correlated with a concept of respect which probably strengthens the potential of gratitude in promoting prosocial motivation...|$|R

5|$|Girlfight {{was filmed}} over 24 days in New York and New Jersey. For scenes inside the gym where Diana and Tiny train, the filmmakers {{shot in a}} {{warehouse}} in Jersey City. The initial boxing sequences were shot from a spectator's view outside of the ring but later sequences were filmed more intimately from inside the ring. Cinematographer Patrick Cady used camera rigs that allowed the actors to hit him or the camera itself to mimic <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> being hit.|$|E
5|$|In Retford, MacMillan was {{introduced}} to ballet by a local dance teacher, Jean Thomas. He had already had lessons in Scottish dancing in Dunfermline and tap dancing in Great Yarmouth, and he took to ballet immediately. In 1942 his mother died, which caused him acute and lasting distress. His father was a distant figure, and the boy's only close family relationship was with an elder sister. His obituarist in The Times suggests that <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> being an outsider, displayed in many of MacMillan's ballets, had its roots in his childhood.|$|E
5|$|Lyrically {{the songs}} {{reflected}} the band members' experiences {{growing up in}} Belleville. Farrar and Tweedy romanticized tales about unemployment, alcoholism, and <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> living {{in a small town}} in an effort to emulate the profundity of songwriters such as Woody Guthrie. Musically, No Depression was influenced by the start-stop musical pattern of the Minutemen. The cover of the album features a blurry photo of the band, taken by J. Hamilton, reminiscent of the albums released on Folkways Records.|$|E

5|$|The {{score for}} the demo was {{composed}} by Mathew Valente, {{who had been with}} the project since its Nintendo 64 version. The score was to consist in arrangements of the official Chrono Trigger soundtrack written by Yasunori Mitsuda, Nobuo Uematsu and Noriko Matsueda. Valente's goal was to retain <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> the original music while enhancing it for a modern platform. Most of the arrangements were created in the Impulse Tracker format, then converted to MIDI and enhanced with a number of tools.|$|E
5|$|Titanfall {{received}} generally favorable reviews, {{according to}} video game review aggregator Metacritic. Critics praised the game's pilot–Titan balance, its Smart Pistol, fast-paced player mobility, and accessibility for players of all skill sets. Reviewers {{complained that the}} AI grunts were too unintelligent, that private match and community support features were lacking, and that the game had shipped with too few multiplayer modes. Multiple reviewers cited the Titan's feeling of grandiosity in the player experience—specifically, the thrill of watching a summoned Titan fall from the sky, but also <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> entering the Titan exoskeleton and of scaling a Titan to take it down.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Graham, {{programmer}} of {{the original}} game, had returned to university after its completion, and David Darling, co-founder of Codemasters, decided {{that they could not}} wait for him to finish his degree. Codemasters approached Peter Williamson of Supersonic Software and had him produce the sequel. Williamson had just completed Cosmic Spacehead and wanted to do something new. It was intended for the sequel to reproduce <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> the original and add as many new features as possible. The original was used for reference, and the code and graphics were produced from the beginning. Williamson explained that it was hoped that they could capture and go beyond that the original game offered, and the game's success was anticipated. Darling wanted it {{to be more than a}} mere continuation of the first.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} as a student, Gaudí was able to study a {{collection}} of photographs of Egyptian, Indian, Persian, Mayan, Chinese and Japanese art owned by the School of Architecture. The collection also included Moorish monuments in Spain, which left a deep mark on him and served as an inspiration in many of his works. He also studied the book Plans, elevations, sections and details of the Alhambra by Owen Jones, which he borrowed from the School's library. He took various structural and ornamental solutions from nazarí and mudéjar art, which he used with variations and stylistic freedom in his works. Notably, Gaudí observed of Islamic art its spatial uncertainty, its concept of structures with limitless space; its feeling of sequence, fragmented with holes and partitions, which create a divide without disrupting <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> open space by enclosing it with barriers.|$|E
5|$|Prosperity {{theology}} {{has become}} popular among poor Americans, {{particularly those who}} seek personal and social advancement. It has seen significant growth in black and Hispanic churches and is particularly popular among immigrants. Apologists for the movement note its ethnic diversity and argue that it encompasses a variety of views. Joel Robbins of Cambridge University notes that most anthropologists attribute the theology's appeal to the poor—especially in the Global South—to {{the fact that it}} promises security and helps explain capitalism. Simon Coleman developed a theory based on the doctrine's rhetoric and <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> belonging it gave parishioners. In a study of the Swedish Word of Life Church, he noted that members felt part of a complex gift-exchange system, giving to God and then awaiting a gift in return (either from God directly or through another church member). Hillsong Church, the largest congregation in Australia, teaches a form of prosperity theology that emphasizes personal success. Marion Maddox has argued that this message has drawn a significant number of upwardly mobile Australians.|$|E
5|$|Rocksteady {{intended}} for Batman, Catwoman, and Robin to offer three different playing experiences. Other villains from Batman's comic history {{were selected to}} show that the prison was a melting pot of people from Gotham. The developers believed that providing a small part of each villain's story rather than focusing on a select few allowed the player to meet many more characters and effectively conveyed <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> being in a superprison filled with supervillains. Rocksteady decided early on that the Joker would die in the story, and developed the idea of him poisoning Batman with the same affliction, in order to show how the two diametrically opposed characters would interact in pursuit of a shared goal. Warner Bros. and Dini did not oppose killing off the character {{as long as it was}} not done for shock value, and as long as they made it clear that Batman was not at fault, since he would not intentionally kill someone.|$|E
50|$|Smith {{presents}} {{the argument that}} approval or disapproval <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> others is completely determined by whether we sympathize or fail to sympathize with their emotions. Specifically, if we sympathize with <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> another we judge that their feelings are just, {{and if we do}} not sympathize we judge that their feelings are unjust.|$|R

5|$|The High Middle Ages was {{a period}} of great {{religious}} movements. Besides the Crusades and monastic reforms, people sought to participate in new forms of religious life. New monastic orders were founded, including the Carthusians and the Cistercians. The latter especially expanded rapidly in their early years under the guidance of Bernard of Clairvaux (d. 1153). These new orders were formed in response to <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> the laity that Benedictine monasticism no longer met the needs of the laymen, who along with those wishing to enter the religious life wanted a return to the simpler hermetical monasticism of early Christianity, or to live an Apostolic life. Religious pilgrimages were also encouraged. Old pilgrimage sites such as Rome, Jerusalem, and Compostela received increasing numbers of visitors, and new sites such as Monte Gargano and Bari rose to prominence.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} {{reacts with}} moisture {{on the skin}} and in the eyes, causing a burning sensation and the immediate forceful and uncontrollable shutting of the eyes. Effects usually include tears streaming from the eyes, profuse coughing, exceptional nasal discharge that is full of mucus, burning in the eyes, eyelids, nose and throat areas, disorientation, dizziness and restricted breathing. It will also burn the skin where sweaty and/or sunburned. In highly concentrated doses it can also induce severe coughing and vomiting. Almost all of the immediate effects wear off within an hour (such as exceptional nasal discharge and profuse coughing), although <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> burning and highly irritated skin may persist for hours. Affected clothing {{will need to be}} washed several times or thrown away.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} built train car interiors for {{the quarantine}} car where {{the patient was}} being kept and the sleeper cars, and floated the train sets on inner tubes to create <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> movement. Seven different cameras were used by director Rob Bowman when filming the train car explosion. Forty-five gallons of gasoline and 120 black-powder bombs {{were used for the}} effect. The car used had been obtained cheaply from a Vancouver-based rail company, and had been considered scrap due to being bent. After the explosion was recorded, a bell from the train was recovered some distance from the site by the physical effects supervisor Dave Gauthier, who had it polished and engraved with a message for Bowman.|$|E
