5|$|The {{albatrosses}} comprise between 13 and 24 species (<b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> {{is still}} {{a matter of some}} debate, 21 being the most commonly accepted number) in four genera. These genera are the great albatrosses (Diomedea), the mollymawks (Thalassarche), the North Pacific albatrosses (Phoebastria), and the sooty albatrosses or sooties (Phoebetria). The North Pacific albatrosses are considered to be a sister taxon to the great albatrosses, while the sooty albatrosses are considered closer to the mollymawks.|$|E

30|$|We {{estimated}} radiolarian diversity {{by analyzing}} the full radiolarian assemblage (the list of taxa is provided in the Additional file 1).

The species diversity was higher during interglacial periods, with a maximum during MIS 5, when <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> radiolarian <b>species</b> exceeded 90 (Fig.  4). Additionally, a drastic increase in <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> radiolarian <b>species</b> was recorded at the MIS 5 / 6 boundary (ca. 130 ka). Before the MIS 5 / 6 boundary, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> radiolarian <b>species</b> (and thus the diversity index) was lower than or close to the median value of 57 and never exceeded 70 (Fig.  4). Thus, radiolarian diversity was higher between 0 and 130 ka than between 130 and 400 ka.|$|R

5|$|Before DNA analysis, the {{taxonomy}} of the widow spider genus Latrodectus had been unclear—changes in <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> reflect {{the difficulty of}} using morphology to determine subdivisions within the genus. Substantial interest in their systematics was most likely prompted by the medical importance of these venomous spiders. Swedish arachnologist Tamerlan Thorell described the redback spider in 1870 from specimens collected in Rockhampton and Bowen in central Queensland. He named it Latrodectus hasseltii in honour of colleague A.W.M. van Hasselt. In the same paper, he named a female from Cape York with an all-black abdomen L. scelio, now regarded as the same species. These specimens are in the Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet in Stockholm.|$|E
5|$|Molecular phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{confirms that}} the Coleoptera are monophyletic. Duane McKenna et al. (2015) used eight nuclear genes for 367 species from 172 of 183 Coleopteran families. They split the Adephaga into 2 clades, Hydradephaga and Geadephaga, broke up the Cucujoidea into 3 clades, and placed the Lymexyloidea within the Tenebrionoidea. The Polyphaga appear to date from the Triassic. Most extant beetle families appear to have arisen in the Cretaceous. The cladogram is based on McKenna (2015). <b>The</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> in each group (mainly superfamilies) is shown in parentheses, and boldface if over 10,000.

5|$|The infrageneric {{classification}} {{has been}} even more complex and many schemes of subgenera, sections, subsections and series have been proposed, although all had certain similarities. Most authorities now consider there to be 10 – 11 sections based on phylogenetic evidence. The problems have largely arisen from {{the diversity of the}} wild species, frequent natural hybridisation and extensive cultivation with escape and subsequent naturalisation. <b>The</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> has varied anywhere from 16 to nearly 160, but is probably around 50 – 60.|$|E
5|$|Antbirds {{are mostly}} birds of humid lowland rainforests. Few species are found at higher elevations, {{with less than}} 10% of species having ranges above 2000 m (6500ft) and almost none with ranges above 3000 m (10000ft). The highest species {{diversity}} {{is found in the}} Amazon basin, with up to 45 species being found in single locations in sites across Brazil, Colombia, Bolivia and Peru. <b>The</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> drops dramatically towards the further reaches of the family's range; there are only seven species in Mexico, for example. Areas of lower thamnophilid diversity may contain localised endemics, however. The Yapacana antbird, for example, is restricted to the stunted woodlands that grow in areas of nutrient-poor white-sand soil (the so-called Amazonian caatinga) in Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia. Some species are predominantly associated with microhabitats within a greater ecosystem; for example, the bamboo antshrike is predominantly found in bamboo patches.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{the work}} on {{albatross}} genera, Robertson and Nunn went on in 1998 to propose a revised taxonomy with 24 different species, compared to the 14 then accepted. This expanded taxonomy elevated many established subspecies to full species, but was criticised for not using, in every case, peer reviewed information to justify the splits. Since then, further studies have in some instances supported or disproved the splits; a 2004 paper analysing the mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites agreed with {{the conclusion that the}} Antipodean albatross and the Tristan albatross were distinct from the wandering albatross, per Robertson and Nunn, but found that the suggested Gibson's albatross, Diomedea gibsoni, was not distinct from the Antipodean albatross. For the most part, an interim taxonomy of 21 species is accepted by ITIS and many other researchers, though by no means all—in 2004 Penhallurick and Wink called for <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> to be reduced to 13 (including the lumping of the Amsterdam albatross with the wandering albatross), although this paper was itself controversial.

5|$|Experts {{disagree}} about <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> in the genus Attalea (broadly defined). In 1965, Dutch taxonomist Jan Gerard Wessels Boer {{estimated that there}} may be as many as 100 species in the genus. In their 1996 Field Guide to the Palms of the Americas Andrew Henderson and coauthors recognised 29 species in the genus, while Sidney Glassman recognised 65 species in his 1999 treatment of the group. Largely following Glassman's lead, Rafaël Govaerts and John Dransfield recognised 67 species in their 2005 World Checklist of Palms. An important element of this disagreement is the decision by Glassman to define species more narrowly than Henderson. As a result, what Henderson interpreted as variation within species, Glassman took as differences between morphologically similar species. This problem is {{complicated by the fact that}} many of these species are poorly represented in herbarium collections. The large size of the leaves, inflorescences and fruit of many Attalea species makes them difficult to collect. In addition, many important collections, including type specimen, have been lost or destroyed. Sparse or incomplete collections make it difficult to differentiate variation within a single species from variation between different species.|$|E
5|$|Part of the {{disparity}} in genus sizes is attributable to historical factors. According to a hypothesis published by Max Walters in 1961, the size of plant genera {{is related to the}} age, not of the taxon itself, but of the concept of the taxon in the minds of taxonomists. Plants which grew in Europe, where most of the early taxonomy was based, were therefore divided into relatively small genera, while those from the tropics were grouped into much larger and more heterogeneous genera. Likewise, plants which shared common medicinal properties, such as the many species of Euphorbia, were united into a single genus, while plants of diverse uses, such as the grasses, were split into many genera. Where there were many classical names for groups of plants, such as in Apiaceae / Umbelliferae or Brassicaceae / Cruciferae, small genera were defined, whereas groups not subdivided by classical authors remained as larger genera, such as Carex. A number of biological factors also influence <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>species.</b> For instance, the occurrence of apomixis allows the recognition of large numbers of agamospecies, and such taxa have helped to bolster genera such as Ranunculus and Potentilla.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the first}} billion years of Earth's history, life {{appeared}} in the oceans and began to affect the Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation of aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as much as 4.1 billion years ago. Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties, and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive. In {{the history of the}} Earth, biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass extinction events. Over 99% of all species that ever lived on Earth are extinct. Estimates of <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> on Earth today vary widely; most species have not been described. Over 7.4 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival.
