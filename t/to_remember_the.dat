5|$|Anaheim University in {{cooperation}} with the Kurosawa Family established the Anaheim University Akira Kurosawa School of Film to offer online and blended learning programs on Akira Kurosawa and filmmaking.

5|$|Episodic {{memory is}} the ability <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> details of {{specific}} events. This sort of memory can last for a lifetime. Much evidence implicates the hippocampus in playing a crucial role: people with severe damage to the hippocampus sometimes show amnesia, that is, inability to form new long-lasting episodic memories.|$|E

5|$|In {{practical}} terms, horses {{prefer to}} eat {{small amounts of}} food steadily throughout the day, {{as they do in}} nature when grazing on pasture. Although this is not always possible with modern stabling practices and human schedules that favor feeding horses twice a day, it is important <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> underlying biology of the animal when determining what to feed, how often, and in what quantities.|$|E
5|$|Some {{critics argue}} that Swift {{did not need to}} defend himself, and To Viscount Molesworth was written to gloat. However, the essence of the letter {{encourages}} the Irish <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> actions of Walpole, Wood, and the British Parliament. By willingly throwing himself before the judgement of his fellow Irishmen and before the final judgement of God, the Drapier claims that he is and always will be on the correct side of the argument.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the {{military}} service of Hawaiians, including James Wood Bush and many others, was largely forgotten, disappearing from the collective {{memories of the}} American Civil War {{and the history of}} Hawaii. However, in recent years, Hawaiian residents, historians, and descendants of Hawaiian combatants in the conflict have insisted on the need <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> legacy of the Hawaiians who fought. Renewed interest in the stories of these individuals and this particular period of Hawaiian-American history have inspired efforts to preserve the memories of the Hawaiians who served in the war.|$|E

5|$|An {{observance}} is {{held each}} year <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> {{victims of the}} bombing. An annual marathon draws thousands, and allows runners to sponsor {{a victim of the}} bombing. For the tenth anniversary of the bombing, the city held 24days of activities, including a week-long series of events known as the National Week of Hope from April 17 to 24, 2005. As in previous years, the tenth anniversary of the bombing observances began with a service at 9:02a.m., marking the moment the bomb went off, with the traditional 168seconds of silence—onesecond for each person who was killed {{as a result of the}} blast. The service also included the traditional reading of the names, read by children to symbolize the future of Oklahoma City.|$|E
5|$|An {{original}} non-canon story {{set in the}} legendarium {{created by}} J. R. R. Tolkien, the game takes place between the events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. The player controls Talion, a Ranger who bonds with the wraith of the Elf Lord Celebrimbor, as the two set out to avenge the deaths of their loved ones. Players can engage in melee combat, and use wraith abilities to fight and manipulate enemies. The game introduces the Nemesis System, which allows the artificial intelligence of non-playable characters <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> deaths of the game's protagonist and react accordingly.|$|E
5|$|Another {{memorial}} in the UK was erected three years later, in 1979, in Cannock Chase, Staffordshire.

There is also a Katyn {{memorial in}} Manchester's Southern Cemetery, unveiled in 1990, {{on one of the}} first occasions the British Government publicly acknowledged that Katyn was a Soviet, rather than Nazi, war atrocity.|$|E

5|$|As {{the most}} populous city of Bangladesh, Dhaka has a vibrant {{cultural}} life. Annual celebrations for Independence Day (26 March), Language Martyrs' Day (21 February) and Victory Day (16 December) are prominently celebrated across the city. Dhaka's people congregate at the Shaheed Minar and the Jatiyo Smriti Soudho <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> national heroes of the liberation war. These occasions are observed with public ceremonies and rallies in public grounds. Many schools and colleges organise fairs, festivals and concerts in which citizens from all levels of society participate.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, Southern Rhodesians' {{service on}} Britain's behalf in the World Wars, {{particularly}} the Second, {{was an integral}} part of the colony's national psyche. The territory had also latterly contributed to British counter-insurgency operations in Malaya, Aden and Cyprus, as well as Operation Vantage in Kuwait. The colonial government's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965 was deliberately made on 11 November, Armistice Day, in an attempt to emphasise the territory's prior war record on Britain's behalf. The proclamation was signed at 11:00 local time, during the customary two-minute silence <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> fallen.|$|E
5|$|Middlesbrough, {{also from}} the Premier League, were the {{opposition}} in the semi-final at the neutral venue of Villa Park in Birmingham. Before the game both players and supporters paused <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> life of West Ham's recently deceased former manager, John Lyall. The first half saw Middlesbrough dominate, but {{they were unable to}} convert any of their chances into goals. They also lost goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer to injury. A long pass by defender Anton Ferdinand was headed down by Ashton to Harewood, whose goal ensured a 1–0 victory for West Ham and a place in the final.|$|E

5|$|Poisonous species {{often use}} bright {{colouring}} to warn potential predators of their toxicity. These warning colours {{tend to be}} red or yellow combined with black, with the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) being an example. Once a predator has sampled one of these, it is likely <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> colouration next time it encounters a similar animal. In some species, such as the fire-bellied toad (Bombina spp.), the warning colouration is on the belly and these animals adopt a defensive pose when attacked, exhibiting their bright colours to the predator. The frog Allobates zaparo is not poisonous, but mimics the appearance of other toxic species in its locality, a strategy that may deceive predators.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his {{participation}} {{in the civil rights}} movement, King was criticized by many groups. This included opposition by more militant blacks such as Nation of Islam member Malcolm X. Stokely Carmichael was a separatist and disagreed with King's plea for racial integration because he considered it an insult to a uniquely African-American culture. Omali Yeshitela urged Africans <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> history of violent European colonization and how power was not secured by Europeans through integration, but by violence and force.|$|E
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> Catholic victory, Claude de La Baume held a local festival {{that took}} place on 21 June, {{resulting}} in his promotion to cardinal by Pope Gregory XIII, and a pension of 1,000 ducats from Philip II of Spain. The citizens of Morteau, who stopped the troops from Neuchâtel, were made citizens of Besançon and received significant financial compensation. François de Lette, Baron of Aubonne, was forced into exile, and Paul de Beaujeu left the region and travelled to Switzerland. Following the battle, Protestantism in Besançon was repressed until {{the signing of the}} Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which allowed Protestants to live in the city unconstrained.|$|E
