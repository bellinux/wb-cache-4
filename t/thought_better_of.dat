25|$|After {{returning}} to Quanzhou in 1346, Ibn Battuta began his journey back to Morocco. In Kozhikode, he once again considered throwing {{himself at the}} mercy of Muhammad bin Tughluq in Delhi, but <b>thought</b> <b>better</b> <b>of</b> it and decided to carry on to Mecca. On his way to Basra he passed through the Strait of Hormuz, where he learned that Abu Sa'id, last ruler of the Ilkhanate Dynasty had died in Persia. Abu Sa'id's territories had subsequently collapsed due to a fierce civil war between the Persians and Mongols.|$|E
25|$|Jefferson {{did not go}} to Staunton: {{his term}} as {{governor}} had just expired, but the legislature had not met to hold an election. After the raid, he took refuge at his farm in Bedford County, and Virginia had no governor for ten days. A number of legislators complained of Jefferson's actions and called for an inquiry into the conduct of the executive (Jefferson and his council), and Henry was among those who took the lead. The resolution passed, but the inquiry was set for the next session, and the legislature <b>thought</b> <b>better</b> <b>of</b> it. Jefferson was angered at Henry's actions, and held a grudge that did not abate until well after Henry's death in 1799.|$|E
25|$|From 30 April 1830 to 17 June 1833 Clio {{was under}} Commander John James Onslow. Around 19 July 1830 she sailed for South America, and on 15 December {{she was in}} Rio de Janeiro. Next, on 2 January 1833, Clio participated in the {{re-establishment}} of British rule on the Falkland Islands. Onslow arrived at Luis Vernet's settlement at Port Louis to request that the Argentine authorities replace {{the flag of the}} United Provinces of the River Plate with the British one and leave the islands. Lieutenant-Colonel José María Pinedo, of the schooner Sarandi considered resisting, but as most of his crew were British, <b>thought</b> <b>better</b> <b>of</b> it and sailed on 5 January.|$|E

500|$|From their {{advantageous}} height by Königgrätz, the Austrians frequently bombarded the Prussian army encamped below them. On {{the same}} day that Frederick's doctors bled him, an Austrian cannonade grew so strong that Frederick rode out to observe the damage. During the ride, his vein opened. A company medic bound his wound, an incident later depicted by the painter Bernhard Rode. In his admiring history of Frederick the Great, the English historian Thomas Carlyle (1795–1881) relayed the story of Frederick and a Croatian marksman. As Frederick was reconnoitering, Carlyle maintained, the King encountered the Croat taking aim at him. Reportedly, he wagged his finger at the man, as if to say, [...] "Do not do that." [...] The Croat <b>thought</b> <b>better</b> <b>of</b> shooting the King, and disappeared into the woods; some reports maintain he actually knelt before the king and kissed his hand.|$|E
500|$|The method {{eliminated}} the psychoanalytic doctrine of neutrality. Reich {{argued that the}} psychoanalytic taboos reinforced the neurotic taboos of the patient, and that he wanted his patients {{to see him as}} human. He would press his thumb or {{the palm of his hand}} hard (and painfully) on their jaws, necks, chests, backs, or thighs, aiming to dissolve their muscular, and thereby characterological, rigidity. He wrote that the purpose of the massage was to retrieve the repressed memory of the childhood situation that had caused the repression. If the session worked, he would see waves of pleasure move through their bodies, which he called the [...] "orgasm reflex." [...] According to Sharaf, the twin goals of Reichian therapy were the attainment of this orgasm reflex during sessions and orgastic potency during intercourse. Reich briefly considered calling it [...] "orgasmotherapy," [...] but <b>thought</b> <b>better</b> <b>of</b> it.|$|E

2500|$|During a 2013 {{interview}} with Chicago Pride, on being {{asked if he}} has kept in contact {{with any of the}} other Cobra actors, he replied [...] "No. There were few I was close with - but mostly the civil suit, and the pressure Bryan Kocis put on the other models, not {{to have anything to do}} with me and then Bryan's death pretty much put an end of the friendships I'd garnered there. From what I've heard some have moved on nicely enough. Some aren't even alive anymore. I randomly saw one in a San Francisco gym during Pride a few years ago but <b>thought</b> <b>better</b> <b>of</b> stopping him to say hello. It's a chapter of my life I don't like to revel in." [...] He stated in the interview that the trend in the pornographic industry is toward unprotected, unsafe sex. He has warned about the social impact on gay and bisexual men's decision making, especially when in the heat of lust and passion, while influenced by alcohol or drugs. He appeared in a short interview for his film Big Easy in 2012.|$|E
