5|$|After {{retiring}} from the post of Superior General of the Holy Ghost Fathers, Lefebvre was approached by traditionalists from the French Seminary in Rome who had been refused tonsure, the rite by which, until 1973, a seminarian became a cleric. <b>They</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> a conservative seminary to complete their studies. After directing them to the University of Fribourg, Switzerland, Lefebvre was urged to teach these seminarians personally. In 1969, he received permission from the local bishop to establish a seminary in Fribourg which opened with nine students, moving to Écône, Switzerland in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Dusk was at 19:00 and the Turkish attack had now reached Malone's Gulley and The Nek. The New Zealanders {{waited until}} the Turks came close, then opened fire in the darkness, {{stopping}} their advance. Seriously outnumbered, <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> reinforcements. Instead, the supporting troops to their rear were withdrawn and the Turks managed to get behind them. So, taking the machine-guns with them, they withdrew off Russell's Top into Rest Gully. This left the defenders at Walker's Ridge isolated {{from the rest of}} the force.|$|E
5|$|French women's {{rights advocates}} invited {{international}} feminists {{to participate in}} a parallel conference to the Paris Conference in hopes that they could gain permission to participate in the official conference. The Inter-Allied Women's Conference asked to be allowed to submit suggestions to the peace negotiations and commissions and were granted the right to sit on commissions dealing specifically with women and children. Though <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> enfranchisement and full legal protection under the law equal with men, those rights were ignored. Women won the right to serve in all capacities, including as staff or delegates in the League of Nations organization. They also won a declaration that member nations should prevent trafficking of women and children and should equally support humane conditions for children, women and men labourers. At the Zürich Peace Conference held between 17-19 May, 1919, the women of the WILPF condemned the terms of the Treaty of Versailles for both is punitive measures, as well as its failure to provide for condemnation of violence and exclusion of women from civil and political participation. Upon reading the Rules of Procedure for the League of Nations, Catherine Marshall, an English suffragist, discovered that the guidelines were completely undemocratic and they were modified based on her suggestion.|$|E

5|$|The {{engineering}} set {{did provide}} some challenges; a {{health and safety}} brief was required for the actors on it as it was still raised off the ground. Furthermore, {{the results of the}} bubbles being sent through water tubes that represented part of the engine core created noise issues for the sound technicians; <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> it to be turned off whenever it wasn't placed in shot. One of the special effects went wrong, causing an actual explosion behind Jeri Ryan rather than simply creating sparks following the weapons fire which would be edited in during post-optical effects. The explosion remained in the final cut. The final day of the shoot took place on March 10; taking the filming period to eight days, a day longer than normal for Voyager episodes. It took place on the set of the Dauntless bridge, in the orange color scheme. The final full scene filmed was of the scene {{at the end of the}} episode where the Dauntless returns to Borg space and Arturis realises he is about to be assimilated, and after an hour of closeups for various scenes, the shoot ended at 12:50am on March 11.|$|E
5|$|Pedro de Alvarado and {{his army}} {{advanced}} along the Pacific coast unopposed {{until they reached}} the Samalá River in western Guatemala. This region formed a part of the K'iche' kingdom, and a K'iche' army tried unsuccessfully to prevent the Spanish from crossing the river. Once across, the conquistadors ransacked nearby settlements. On 8 February 1524 Alvarado's army fought a battle at Xetulul, (modern San Francisco Zapotitlán). The Spanish and their allies stormed the town and set up camp in the marketplace. Alvarado then headed upriver into the Sierra Madre mountains towards the K'iche' heartlands, crossing the pass into the valley of Quetzaltenango. On 12 February 1524 Alvarado's Mexican allies were ambushed in the pass and driven back by K'iche' warriors but a Spanish cavalry charge scattered the K'iche' and the army crossed to the city of Xelaju (modern Quetzaltenango) to find it deserted. The Spanish accounts relate that at least one and possibly two of the ruling lords of Q'umarkaj died in the fierce battles upon the initial approach to Quetzaltenango. Almost a week later, on 18 February 1524, a 30,000-strong K'iche' army confronted the Spanish army in the Quetzaltenango valley and was comprehensively defeated; many K'iche' nobles were among the dead. This battle exhausted the K'iche' militarily and <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> peace, and invited Pedro de Alvarado into their capital Q'umarkaj. Alvarado was deeply suspicious of K'iche' intentions but accepted the offer and marched to Q'umarkaj with his army. At Tzakahá the Spanish conducted a Roman Catholic mass under a makeshift roof; this site was chosen to build the first church in Guatemala. The first Easter mass held in Guatemala was celebrated in the new church, during which high-ranking natives were baptised.|$|E

25|$|Police {{were met}} with silence in many areas as <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> {{witnesses}} to come forward, receiving few tips despite so many people having been witnesses to, or victims of, the events.

Officers built relationships with residents of these communities, helping them overcome a historic distrust of police and fears of gang retaliation.|$|E

25|$|The Franks of Acre {{were for}} some time aware of the {{seriousness}} of the situation. <b>They</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> help from Europe which resulted in nothing significant.

Burchard of Schwanden, the Grand Master of the German Teutonic Knights, resigned and was replaced by Konrad von Feuchtwangen who suddenly left Acre for Europe. The only noteworthy reinforcement came from king Henry II of Cyprus who fortified the walls and sent forces led by his brother Amalric to defend the city.|$|E

Weitzman set up his own optical house and motion picture postproduction facility later that year.

In order to construct their model of DNA, Watson and Crick made use of information from unpublished X-ray diffraction images of Franklin's (shown at meetings and freely shared by Wilkins), including preliminary accounts of Franklin's results/photographs of the X-ray images that were included in a written progress report for the King's College laboratory of Sir John Randall from late 1952.|$|E
25|$|When the Turks in Samarra {{realized}} that al-Musta'in had {{departed from the}} city, they cut off traffic to Baghdad.

Al-Musta'in, while promising the Turks that they would continue to be paid, refused to leave Baghdad, and he and Muhammad b. 'Abdallah mocked them for their perceived insolence. The humiliated Turks angrily returned to Samarra and told their compatriots what had happened; they then decided to depose al-Musta'in. The soldiers released al-Mu'tazz from his prison and acknowledged him as their caliph. Al-Mu'tazz agreed to the proposal and an oath of allegiance was drawn up; many of the officials in Samarra then swore allegiance to him.|$|E
