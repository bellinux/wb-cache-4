The letters Frank Congdon gave me took me into an artistic bunch about as gay and queer as Frank is, but they've been mighty nice to me. I've been setting for my bust to Mr. Moss, who is a sculptor. He has a big studio clear on the top of one of the tallest blocks here and has some dandy lamps and things. I've bought some to bring back. I met a Mr. Humiston there from New York, and he made a sketch of me--wants me to see his studio in New York. I don't know whether I'll go on or let Mart go with Lucius. Lucius is all right--I don't see how I got on without him. He knows everything. I wish I had half the {{education}} he's got. He's up on all the society ways and puts me on. For instance, he told me <b>the</b> <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> would be to give a dinner to this artist push and to the people that Dorothy give me a letter to, and I'm going to do it. Lucius will look out for the whole thing. You should see the way the waiters tend. I reckon Lucius has told 'em we're made of money. I'm afraid we're getting spoilt, Muzz.

6000|$|Densher was to feel sure {{afterwards}} that Kate had had {{in these}} pleasantries no conscious, above all no insolent purpose of making light of poor Susan Shepherd's property in their young friend--which property, by such remarks, {{was very much}} pushed to the wall; {{but he was also}} to know that Mrs. Stringham had secretly resented them, Mrs. Stringham holding the opinion, of which he was ultimately to have a glimpse, that all the Kate Croys in Christendom were but dust for the feet of her Milly. That, it was true, would be what she must reveal only when driven to her last entrenchments and well cornered in her passion--the rare passion of friendship, the sole passion of her little life save the one other, more imperturbably cerebral, that she entertained for the art of Guy de Maupassant. She slipped in the observation that her Milly was incapable of change, was just exactly, on the contrary, the same Milly; but this made little difference in the drift of Kate's contention. She was perfectly kind to Susie: {{it was as if she}} positively knew her as handicapped for any disagreement by feeling that she, Kate, had [...] "type," [...] and by being committed to admiration of type. Kate had occasion subsequently--she found it somehow--to mention to our young man Milly's having spoken to her of this view on the good lady's part. She would like--Milly had had it from her--to put Kate Croy in a book and see what she could so do with her. [...] "Chop me up fine or serve me whole"--it was a way of being got at that Kate professed she dreaded. It would be Mrs. Stringham's, however, she understood, because Mrs. Stringham, oddly, felt that with such stuff as the strange English girl was made of, stuff that (in spite of Maud Manningham, who was full of sentiment) she had never known, there was none other to be employed. These things were of later evidence, yet Densher might even then have felt them in the air. They were practically in it already when Kate, waiving the question of her friend's chemical change, wound up with the comparatively unobjectionable proposition that he must now, having missed so much, take them all up, on trust, further on. He met it peacefully, a little perhaps as an example to Mrs. Stringham--"Oh as far on as you like!" [...] This even had its effect: Mrs. Stringham appropriated as much of it as might be meant for herself. <b>The</b> <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> about her was that she could measure how much; so that by the time dinner was over they had really covered ground.|$|E

Most of the time, he plays it straight, and other times he will speed up the action into a kind of blur, to indicate time passing; or he'll fade out and back into the same shot, as though to indicate renewed focus.

In 1962 Avondale became home to the St. Ann's Infant and Maternity Home operated by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington. Avondale is also home to the NMS Healthcare of Hyattsville Nursing Home as well as the Malta House Assisted Living Facility and St. Ann's Catholic High School. Interestingly, residents of Avondale live right {{down the street from the}} Catholic University of America in Washington D.C. <b>The</b> <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> about Avondale, itself, is that it borders Washington D.C. very closely.

Next to Washington Gas, there is a Public Storage facility. Public Storage is basically a private company that allows people to pay a fee in order to rent space to store their stuff.|$|E

[...] Additionally, Anders believed some in the counterculture wished to modify children's education so that it didn't discourage, but rather encouraged, [...] "aesthetic sense, love of nature, passion for music, desire for reflection, or strongly marked independence."In 2007, Merry Prankster Carolyn [...] "Mountain Girl" [...] Garcia commented, [...] "I see remnants of that movement everywhere.

They are understandably worried about their next step as musicians: How are they going to enter the industry? How are they going to make a living? And because of that, that can trickle down. <b>The</b> <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> at Oberlin is that they are immensely talented, but they're not really concerned about their future. They might be a little bit, but it's not what occupies their thoughts. They are thinking about music as an art form. They're preoccupied with how they're going to change the artistic culture. And I think that's actually very important." ...|$|E

So it's my recollection of then … - Paul McCartney Irked at the reverence afforded John Lennon following the latter's murder in 1980, McCartney sought to alter the perception that Lennon had been the true creative leader of the Beatles. In this way, the book was an extension of McCartney's campaign to establish his legacy, {{particularly with regard to}} the Beatles' forays into the avant-garde, and followed statements he had made on the subject in a 1986 interview with Rolling Stone magazine and in the programme for his 1989-90 world tour. The majority of Many Years from Now covers the Lennon-McCartney songwriting partnership, {{the rise and fall of}} the Beatles, and McCartney's immersion in the vibrant arts scene of 1960s London. Of the 600-plus pages, just twenty focus on his life after the Beatles' break-up in 1970.|$|E
5000|$|For Our World, the Beatles {{were asked}} to provide a song with a message that could be easily {{understood}} by everyone. The band undertook the assignment {{at a time when they}} were committed to two film projects: a planned television special, Magical Mystery Tour, and the animated feature Yellow Submarine, for which they were contractually obliged to United Artists to supply four new recordings. [...] "All You Need Is Love" [...] was selected for Our World for its contemporary social significance over the Paul McCartney-written [...] "Your Mother Should Know". In a statement to Melody Maker magazine, Brian Epstein, the band's manager, said of [...] "All You Need Is Love": [...] "It was an inspired song and they really wanted to give the world a message. <b>The</b> <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> about it is that it cannot be misinterpreted. It is a clear message saying that love is everything." [...] Lennon later attributed the song's simple lyrical statements to his liking of slogans and television advertising. He also likened the song to a propaganda piece, adding: [...] "I'm a revolutionary artist. My art is dedicated to change." [...] Author Mark Hertsgaard views it as the Beatles' [...] "most political song yet" [...] up to 1967 and the origins of Lennon's posthumous standing as a [...] "humanitarian hero".|$|E

I think the tape operator was Robin Black, who later {{went on to}} produce Jethro Tull and other notable acts of the time.I recall {{that we were all}} quite chuffed with the end result of this, our first offering after my not too long ago departure from Jethro Tull.One of the first songs we laid down was ‘It’s Only Love’ and it was cool at the time to have the availability of an eight-track machine to record with. Great for overdubs and thickening out the sound ...‘Dear Jill’ (a favourite of mine to this day) was the next track we laid down and <b>the</b> <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> about it was that by double-tracking the guitar, which was an Ecko 12-string with only 9-10 strings on it (depending on my mood or how many strings I could afford on the day) it sounded akin to a modern chorus effect pedal which, coupled with Jack’s haunting soprano sax, made it into a solid stand up song. It was featured in Cameron Crowe’s movie Almost Famous as part of the background music to reflect the theme and time of the film.|$|E
5000|$|Diagnosed HIV {{positive}} in 1983, Locke retired from stage and screen {{and became an}} activist against the virus. He took education at the American Red Cross and the Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York City, then used his name and celebrity to make personal appearances at sensible sex seminars around the country. Eventually, Locke moved to Desert Hot Springs near Palm Springs, California and built a geodesic domed home, powered by electricity from his own windmill. He did volunteer work from the Desert AIDS Project and gave weekly messages at the Villa Caprice Hotel in nearby Cathedral City. Returning to the Bay area a few years later, he had recently lived on the Russian River. When his health began failing in February, 1996, he moved to an apartment in Sacramento {{to be close to}} his family and the medical facilities at UC-Davis. Locke was inducted into the Hall of Fame at the 1994 Gay Erotic Video Awards in Los Angeles. He returned to the screen in 1995 to play a non-sexual role in Jerry Douglas' The Diamond Stud , which was destined to be farewell appearance. He had also written the books Locked Out, In The Heat Of Passion, was working on two unfinished autobiographies, [...] "Living" [...] and [...] "Dying" [...] and his one-act play, “Loving,” was filmed in 1995 in Toronto for future release. Services were held on September 29, 1996 in Sacramento, with interment at Benicia Cemetery outside Oakland. He is survived by his parents, Cay and Bess Locke, his brother Robert Locke, and his sister Janet Locke, all of Sacramento, and brother Clay Locke, Jr. of Fremont, California. Locke said in the Manshots interview “You know, <b>the</b> <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> about film is that I will live a long time, even after I die. Cause it's there.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Slowe {{was awarded}} his Ph.D. in Physics from Harvard for his thesis [...] "Experiments and {{simulations}} in cooling and trapping {{of a high}} flux rubidium beam". His thesis advisor was Prof. Lene Hau. During his time as a research assistant at Harvard, he also began to devise computer programs. Whilst studying, in {{the final year of}} his PhD he and fellow student Zak Stone gained startup monies from Y Combinator for their company Memamps. [...] "I just wanted to design something {{to make it easier to}} work on my thesis," [...] Slowe explained. [...] "And I'll still be happy if that's what I end up with." [...] Memamps failed as both Google and Apple introduced software similar to that which Slowe was seeking to develop. Immediately upon graduating, in what has been considered a startling departure from expectations, he left academia to co-found reddit, a social news website where users can post links to content on the web. Other users may then vote the posted links up or down, causing them to appear more or less prominently on the reddit home page. [...] Of this change in direction, Slowe explained that [...] "(my) career path may have veered away from the original degree, but that's <b>the</b> <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> about start-ups - they're usually built around an idea that nobody has previously thought of. In these situations, past experience may not help. What is needed most is insane determination to see something through when failure is a more likely result than success.". Of his decision to move away from science and into in an entrepreneurial direction, he notes “I can’t think of another decision that has affected me more". Slowe had realised that academia was not the road for him. “I got into physics because I liked hard problems, and I enjoyed the process of discovery in solving them. Though the types of problems are drastically different, startup life is structured much the same way.” ...|$|E
