40|$|Psychiatry is that {{branch of}} the medical profession, which deals with the origin, diagnosis, prevention, and {{management}} of mental disorders or mental illness, emotional and behavioural disturbances. Thus, a psychiatrist is a trained doctor who has received further training {{in the field of}} diagnosing and managing mental illnesses, mental disorders and emotional and behavioural disturbances. This EPA Guidance document was developed following consultation and literature searches as well as grey literature and was approved by <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> Guidance <b>Committee.</b> <b>The</b> role and responsibilities of the psychiatrist include planning and delivering high quality services within the resources available and to advocate for the patients and the services. The European Psychiatric Association seeks to rise to the challenge of articulating these roles and responsibilities. This EPA Guidance is directed towards psychiatrists and the medical profession as a whole, towards other members of the multidisciplinary teams as well as to employers and other stakeholders such as policy makers and patients and their families...|$|R
40|$|Air {{protection}} agencies from twenty-seven states, coordinated {{through the}} Eastern Regional Technical Advisory Committee (ERTAC), identified {{a need to}} better quantify and characterize rail-related emissions inventories. Traditional locomotives largely utilize diesel combustion engines, resulting in emissions of NOx, diesel PM, hydrocarbons, and greenhouse gases (e. g. CO 2). These emissions are sometimes concentrated in areas exceeding National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Inventory development methods for locomotive emissions estimates vary dramatically {{from state to state}} and, in general, lack the spatial or temporal resolution needed to support air quality modeling. The ERTAC Rail Subcommittee was established with active representatives from twelve member states, three regional planning offices, and <b>the</b> US <b>EPA.</b> <b>The</b> <b>committee’s</b> goals are to (1) standardize agencies’ inventory development methods through a collaborative effort, (2) improve the quality of data received and the resulting emission inventories, and (3) reduce the administrative burden on railroad companies of providing data. The ERTAC Rail Subcommittee has identified five major rail-related source categories of interest and is working with the railroad industry to establish the methodology, collect the supporting data for a 2008 regional or nationwide emissions inventory, and to prepare a protocol for future inventory development. The Association of American Railroads has been coordinatin...|$|R

50|$|Second, Congress {{expanded}} <b>the</b> <b>EPA’s</b> {{coverage to}} professionals and other white-collar employees. For {{the first nine}} years of <b>the</b> <b>EPA,</b> <b>the</b> requirement of equal pay for equal work did not extend to persons employed in an executive, administrative or professional capacity, or as an outside salesperson. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> exempted white-collar women from the protection of equal pay for equal work. In 1972, Congress enacted the Educational Amendment of 1972, which amended the FLSA to expand the coverage of <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> to these employees, by excluding <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> from <b>the</b> professional workers exemption of the FLSA.|$|R

50|$|After {{decades of}} investigation, {{including}} multiple studies, public meetings, and public comment periods, <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> selected a final site cleanup plan.

5000|$|After {{these and}} other {{thorough}} investigations, <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> signed a Record of Decision (ROD) for OU-1.

2500|$|In March 2005, {{nine states}} (California, New York, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, New Mexico and Vermont) sued <b>the</b> <b>EPA.</b> <b>The</b> <b>EPA's</b> Inspector General had {{determined}} that <b>the</b> <b>EPA's</b> regulation of mercury emissions {{did not follow}} the Clean Air Act, and that the regulations were influenced by top political appointees. <b>The</b> <b>EPA</b> had suppressed a study it commissioned by Harvard University which contradicted its position on mercury controls. The suit alleged that <b>the</b> <b>EPA's</b> rule exempting coal-fired power plants from [...] "maximum available control technology" [...] was illegal, and additionally charged that <b>the</b> <b>EPA's</b> system of cap-and-trade to lower average mercury levels would allow power plants to forego reducing mercury emissions, which they objected would lead to dangerous local hotspots of mercury contamination even if average levels declined. Several states also began to enact their own mercury emission regulations. Illinois's proposed rule would have reduced mercury emissions from power plants {{by an average of}} 90% by 2009. In 2008—by which point a total of fourteen states had joined the suit—the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> regulations violated <b>the</b> Clean Air Act.|$|R
