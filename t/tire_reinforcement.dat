Such wires, often bundled into ropes, are commercially used as piano wires, ropes for suspension bridges, and as steel cord for <b>tire</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> High degrees of wire drawing (logarithmic strain above 3) leads to pearlitic wires with yield strengths of several gigapascals. It makes pearlite {{one of the strongest}} structural bulk materials on earth.Some hypereutectoid pearlitic steel wires, when cold wire drawn to true (logarithmic) strains above 5, can even show a maximal tensile strength above 6 GPa. Although pearlite is used in many engineering applications, the origin of its extreme strength is not well understood. It has been recently shown that cold wire drawing not only strengthens pearlite by refining the lamellae structure, but also simultaneously causes partial chemical decomposition of cementite, associated with an increased carbon content of the ferrite phase, and even a structural transition from crystalline to amorphous cementite. The deformation-induced decomposition and microstructural change of cementite is closely related to several other phenomena such as a strong redistribution of carbon and other alloy elements like Si and Mn in both the cementite and the ferrite phase; a variation of the deformation accommodation at the phase interfaces due to a change in the carbon concentration gradient at the interfaces; and mechanical alloying.|$|E
40|$|The waste tire is {{produced}} more than 10 million tons {{every year in the}} world. This problem needs serious treatment to eliminate the waste tires. This work is aimed to recycle the waste tire in concrete as a reinforcement. The contribution of the waste tires in flexural strength capacity of concrete is investigated by using experimental work and numerical simulation. Since material is quite non-homogenous compared to the pure concrete, we use six concrete beam specimens with dimension 150 mm x 150 mm x 1000 mm to get better fitting results. One specimen is non reinforced concrete beam and five specimens are waste tires reinforced concrete beam. For each of the five specimen, the waste <b>tire</b> <b>reinforcement</b> is tensioned with 0 %, 17 %, 25 %, 40 % and 60 % strain before casting the concrete. The flexural strength tests are conducted after 28 days concrete ages under three point loadings. After the test, we observe that the waste <b>tire</b> <b>reinforcement</b> together with pre-stress contribute significantly on the flexural strength of the concrete beam as predicted. Finally, to support the test, finite element analysis is performed as well in this work and compared with the experimental results...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{was aimed at}} providing geotechnical information on the design and construction procedures related {{to the use of}} scrap tires in gravity retaining structures and reinforced fills. If layers of tires, side by side, are filled with soil and tied together to make a mat or a chain, and then placed in successive layers, the resulting structure {{can be used as a}} retaining wall or reinforced fill and can provide a practical alternative for the use of this waste. The research also investigated the chemical quality of effluent water emanating from buried tire waste. The shear resistance of a soil-geotextile interface may be a fraction of the shear resistance of the soil itself. If the reinforcement function is accomplished with tire mats filled with soil, the shearing resistance between the soil and the reinforcement is primarily due to the shear resistance of the soil itself. If the tires are cut to remove the sidewalls, the placement of the soil in the tires is facilitated. A higher degree of compaction is therefore obtained and the shear resistance of the interface between the reinforcement and the soil corresponds to the shear strength of the soil. Earth structures using tires filled with soil have more flexibility than conventional structures and are able to withstand large differential settlements. The flexibility of the resulted material implies that it can be used to support earth fills on compressible ground. An important feature of the investigations was a large number of field pull-out tests on different configurations of tire mats. These tests provided valuable data on the interaction between the different soils and the <b>tire</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> This behaviour is necessary for the design of tire reinforced structures. Also, three large plate loading tests were performed on the surface of the completed test fill to assess the load deformation behaviour of this composite material. To evaluate any toxic effects of buried used tires on the surrounding groundwater, a drainage system was installed below the embankment and the effluent collected in three wells. Samples were periodically collected and analysed for chemical quality. Additional tests on water quality were performed in laboratory test columns in which tire chips were embedded in sand or clay to provide a conservative estimate. Some organic compounds can be leached out of the tire reinforced structure placed above the water table. Laboratory batch tests performed on tire chips embedded in sand provided evidence of an increase in solution of certain metal elements of which some exceed their respective drinking water standards.

40|$|AbstractAmount {{of waste}} tires in Indonesia is about 50 million pieces {{per year in}} which serious {{treatments}} are necessary in the future. This is because their utilizations are still limited and requires further studies to increase their feasible added value. With this regards, this work is aimed to investigate possibilities on using of waste <b>tires</b> as <b>reinforcement</b> material for concrete by experimental and finite element simulation. With concrete as matrix, {{both of them are}} implemented in non-prestressed and prestressed waste tire reinforced concrete in standard flexural testing procedures. Two concrete beam specimens with reinforcement and one specimen without reinforcement are used to investigate the flexural capacity. Dimension of the all specimens are 150 mm x 150 mm x 1000 mm. In the prestressed specimens, the waste tire reinforced are tensioned with 0 % and 17 % of their strain before casting of concrete. After the concrete are hardened, they are then jacked at the end of concrete beam using anchorage clamping. The flexural strength tests are carried out by using three point loading scenario for the beam after 28 days concrete ages. The result shows that prestressed force of waste <b>tires</b> as <b>reinforcement</b> contribute significantly on the flexural strength of the concrete beam over the non-waste <b>tires</b> <b>reinforcement</b> as well as non-prestressed one. Finally, finite element analysis simulating the test is also introduced here to give an initial study on how to model behavior of this type of concrete composite in global responses...|$|R

Specifically, spray dryer ash was investigated for use as the primary or even the sole binding component in a mortar or concrete.

The police enforcement, which had kept a low profile in Bedford-Stuyvesant, suddenly called for reinforcements. CORE members tried to control the crowd and in a last attempt told them to go back home. At that point, a thousand people were standing on the street corner, infuriated and ready for action. Bottles were thrown and cops' heads were the target. To the sound of sirens and <b>tires,</b> the <b>reinforcements</b> arrived at their destination and the police charged the mob, making no apparent distinction between innocents and enemies.

40|$|One {{possible}} {{alternative to}} conventional transverse reinforcement {{is to use}} scrap tires for column confinement. However, there is currently no experimental data available {{on the effectiveness of}} scrap <b>tires</b> as confinement <b>reinforcement.</b> It is the objective of the current research program to conduct experimental and analytical investigation to explore the possibilities of using scrap steel-belted tires as transverse column reinforcement for bridge columns. The experimental investigation included testing six large-scale circular columns, confined with scrap tires, under simulated seismic loading. Three different arrangements of tires were used as confinement reinforcement which allowed the investigation of different parameters of confinement on column behavior. The columns were tested under two different levels of axial load, consisting of 11 % or 21 % of their concentric capacities. Analyses of columns were also conducted using the computer program COLA, which had been developed for inelastic static analysis of conventionally reinforced concrete columns. It was shown both experimentally and analytically that steel-belted tires can be used effectively to confine concrete in reinforced concrete columns. This new approach eliminates many of the construction difficulties involved in building seismic resistant concrete columns, while protecting steel against corrosion.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{accurately}} predict vehicle dynamic properties when tires impact high obstacles or large bumps, appropriate tire models {{need to be}} developed and characterised. The Flexible Ring Tire (FTire) model is one of the models for predicting the transient dynamic responses when traversing obstacles. In this thesis, a combination of experimental tests and Finite Element (FE) modelling is used in deriving FTire models for different levels of tire/road interaction severity. A FE tire model is built to characterize tire properties including static properties, steady-state rolling properties and transient dynamic rolling properties. A 235 / 60 R 18 tire is cut in order that the tire cross-section can be captured and the <b>tire</b> rubber and <b>reinforcement</b> components can be extracted. A detailed method for the determination of geometrical and material properties of tires has been developed for tire modelling. The 2 D and 3 D models for static and dynamic analysis are both developed using a commercial FE code ABAQUS. The parameters of FTire model are derived based on the experimental data and FE simulation data, and different FTire models are derived under different operation conditions. Multi-body dynamic analysis is carried out using these FTire models, and the transient dynamic responses using different FTire models are compared with each other. It is shown that FE modelling can be used to accurately characterise the behaviour of a tire where limitations in experimental facilities prevent tire characterisation using the required level of input severity in physical tests...|$|R
