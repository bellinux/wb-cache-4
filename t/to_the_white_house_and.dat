5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> the National First Ladies' Library, {{there have}} been 47 First Ladyships. This {{discrepancy}} exists because Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is counted chronologically as both the 22nd and the 24th president; his spouse Frances Cleveland is also counted twice. Following Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20, 2017, his spouse, Melania Trump, became the 47th official First Lady, succeeding Michelle Obama, wife of former President Barack Obama.|$|E

5|$|Buchanan {{resented the}} fact that Breckinridge had {{supported}} both Pierce and Douglas before endorsing his nomination.

Feeling slighted by the response, Breckinridge refused to carry out these instructions; later, three of Buchanan's intimates informed Breckinridge that requesting to speak to Miss Lane was actually a secret instruction to White House staff to usher the requestor into a private audience with the president. They also conveyed Buchanan's apologies for the misunderstanding.|$|E
5|$|The {{check on}} Forbes' {{authority}} at Perryville was Dr. Sawyer, Harding's physician {{and chairman of}} the Federal Hospitalization Board. Sawyer told Harding that Forbes was selling valuable hospital supplies to an insider contractor. At first Harding did not believe it, but Sawyer secured proof in January 1923. A shocked Harding, who alternated between rage and despondency over the corruption in his administration, summoned Forbes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> demanded his resignation. Harding did not want an open scandal and allowed Forbes to flee to Europe, from where he resigned on February 15, 1923. In spite of Harding's efforts, gossip about Forbes' activities resulted in the Senate ordering an investigation two weeks later, and in mid-March, Cramer committed suicide.|$|E
