40|$|A {{competitive}} CZE {{method for}} quality control analysis of multivitamin preparations and veterinary products containing B-group vitamins was developed. Vitamins of interest are thiamine hydrochloride (B 1), <b>thiamine</b> <b>monophosphate</b> <b>chloride</b> (B 1 a), riboflavine (B 2), riboflavine- 5 ′monophosphate (B 2 a), nicotinamide (B 3), d-pantothenic acid calcium salt (B 5), pyridoxine hydrochloride (B 6), folic acid (B 9), and 4 -aminobenzoic acid (B 10). These analytes were separated optimizing the experimental conditions in 20 [*]mM tetraborate buffer pH = 9. 2 as a BGE (background electrolyte), on a Beckman P/ACE System MDQ instrument, using uncoated fused silica capillary. The effective capillary length was of 49. 5 [*]cm, I. D. = 50 [*]μm, the applied voltage 20 [*]kV {{and the temperature}} 25 °C. Detection was performed by a diode array detector at 214 [*]nm for all vitamins except B 5 (190 [*]nm) and B 2 a (260 [*]nm). Separation time was about 9 [*]min. After experimental conditions optimization, the proposed method was validated. Precision of migration time and corrected peak area, linearity range, LOD and LOQ, accuracy (recovery), robustness, and ruggedness were evaluated for each analyte demonstrating the good reliability of the method.

40|$|Two {{types of}} mutants of Escherichia coli were isolated, {{one of which}} (mutant 70 - 23 - 107) responded to {{thiamine}} pyrophosphate, and the other (mutant 70 - 23 - 102) to <b>thiamine</b> <b>monophosphate</b> and <b>thiamine</b> pyrophosphate. They were produced by further mutation of a thiamine auxotroph of E. coli 70 - 23 with N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. The parent organism required thiamine because phosphohydroxymethylpyrimidine kinase activity was lacking in this organism, and hydroxymethylpyrimidine pyrophosphate was not permeable through the cell membrane of E. coli. <b>Thiamine,</b> <b>thiamine</b> <b>monophosphate,</b> and <b>thiamine</b> pyrophosphate were all equally active for the parent, whereas mutants 70 - 23 - 102 and 70 - 23 - 107 lost their ability to grow on thiamine.

Experimental results with the newly isolated mutants indicate that in E. coli the free form of thiamine {{is not involved in}} de novo synthesis of thiamine pyrophosphate, but <b>thiamine</b> <b>monophosphate,</b> an exclusive product formed by the reaction between hydroxymethylpyrimidine pyrophosphate and hydroxyethylthiazole monophosphate, is directly phosphorylated to form thiamine pyrophosphate.

A 6 - to 10 -fold increase in growth, as measured turbidimetrically, was observed when Iso VitaleX was added to a basal medium of brain heart infusion broth to a final concentration of 1 % (vol/vol).

40|$|SummaryRiboswitches are noncoding mRNA {{elements}} that bind small-molecule metabolites with high affinity and specificity, and they regulate {{the expression of}} associated genes. The thi-box riboswitch can exhibit a 1000 -fold higher affinity for thiamine pyrophosphate over closely related noncognate compounds such as <b>thiamine</b> <b>monophosphate.</b> To understand the chemical basis of thi-box pyrophosphate specificity, we have determined crystal structures of an E. coli thi-box bound to <b>thiamine</b> pyrophosphate, <b>thiamine</b> <b>monophosphate,</b> and the structural analogs benfotiamine and pyrithiamine. When bound to monophosphorylated compounds, the RNA {{elements that}} recognize the thiamine and phosphate moieties of the ligand move closer together. This allows the riboswitch to recognize the monophosphate {{in a manner similar}} to how it recognizes the β-phosphate of thiamine pyrophosphate.

In immunodiffusion tests, HH group bacteria had at least two antigens common to {{all members of the}} group, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that they have similar cell envelope protein profiles. A quantitatively variable yellow pigment with absorption maxima of 430 to 435 nm was present in strains of H. somnus and H. agni. The HH group did not produce catalase and grew only in air containing 10 % CO 2. Of 10 HH group bacteria, 9 required <b>thiamine</b> <b>monophosphate</b> for growth. A. seminis was distinguished from the HH group by its lack of yellow pigment, production of catalase, growth in air, lack of a <b>thiamine</b> <b>monophosphate</b> requirement, and different cell envelope protein profile.

40|$|Thiamine {{transport}} in cultured neuroblastoma {{cells is}} mediated by a high-affinity carrier (KM = 40 nM). In contrast, the uptake {{of the more}} hydrophobic sulbutiamine (isobutyrylthiamine disulfide) is unsaturable and its initial transport rate is 20 -times faster than for thiamine. In the cytoplasm, sulbutiamine is rapidly hydrolyzed and reduced to free thiamine, the overall process resulting in a rapid and concentrative thiamine accumulation. Incorporation of radioactivity from [14 C]thiamine or [14 C]sulbutiamine into intracellular thiamine diphosphate is slow in both cases. Despite {{the fact that the}} diphosphate is probably the direct precursor for both <b>thiamine</b> <b>monophosphate</b> and triphosphate, the specific radioactivity increased much faster for the latter two compounds than for thiamine diphosphate. This suggests the existence of two pools of thiamine diphosphate, the larger one having a very slow turnover (about 17 h); a much smaller, rapidly turning over pool would be the precursor of thiamine mono- and triphosphate. The turnover time for thiamine triphosphate could be estimated to be 1 - 2 h. When preloading the cells with [14 C]sulbutiamine was followed by a chase with the same concentration of the unlabeled compound, the specific radioactivities of <b>thiamine</b> and <b>thiamine</b> <b>monophosphate</b> decreased exponentially as expected, but labeling of the diphosphate continued to increase slowly. Specific radioactivity of thiamine triphosphate increased first, but after 30 min it began to slowly decrease. These results show {{for the first time the}} existence of distinct thiamine diphosphate pools in the same homogeneous cell population. They also suggest a complex compartmentation of thiamine metabolism. Peer reviewe...|$|R

The tsetse fly (Diptera: Glossinidae), the obligate vector of African trypanosomes (Trypanosoma brucei subspp.), harbours two enteric Gammaproteobacteria symbionts: Wigglesworthia glossinidia and Sodalis glossinidius. Host coevolution has streamlined the Wigglesworthia genome {{to complement the}} exclusively sanguivorous tsetse lifestyle. Comparative genomics reveal that the Sodalis genome contains the majority of Wigglesworthia genes. This significant genomic overlap calls into question why tsetse maintains the coresidence of both symbionts and, furthermore, how symbiont homeostasis is maintained. One of the few distinctions between the Wigglesworthia and Sodalis genomes lies in thiamine biosynthesis. While Wigglesworthia can synthesize thiamine, Sodalis lacks this capability but retains a thiamine ABC transporter (tbpAthiPQ) believed to salvage thiamine. This genetic complementation may represent the early convergence of metabolic pathways that may act to retain Wigglesworthia and evade species antagonism.

40|$|Thiamine (Vitamin B 1) is an {{essential}} vitamin that must {{be obtained from the}} diet for proper neurological function. At higher doses, thiamine and benfotiamine (S-benzoylthiamine O-monophosphate, BT) –a phosphorylated derivative of thiamine– have antinociceptive effects in animals and humans, although how these compounds inhibit pain is unknown. Here, we found that Prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP, ACPP) can dephosphorylate BT in vitro, in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons and in primary-afferent axon terminals in the dorsal spinal cord. The dephosphorylated product S-benzoylthiamine (S-BT) then decomposes to O-benzoylthiamine (O-BT) and to thiamine in a pH-dependent manner, independent of additional enzymes. This unique reaction mechanism reveals that BT only requires a phosphatase for conversion to thiamine. However, we found that the antinociceptive effects of BT, <b>thiamine</b> <b>monophosphate</b> (TMP) and thiamine–a compound that is not phosphorylated–were entirely dependent on PAP at the spinal level. Moreover, pharmacokinetic studies with wild-type and Pap 2 / 2 mice revealed that PAP is not required for the conversion of BT to thiamine in vivo. Taken together, our study highlights an obligatory role for PAP in the antinociceptive effects of thiamine and phosphorylated thiamine analogs, and suggests a novel phosphatase-independent function for PAP...|$|R
40|$|Thiamine {{metabolites}} {{and activities}} of thiamine-dependent enzymes are impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To clarify the mechanism for the reduction of thiamine diphosphate (TDP), an active form of thiamine and critical coenzyme of glucose metabolism, in AD. Forty-five AD patients clinically diagnosed and 38 age- and gender-matched control subjects without dementia were voluntarily recruited. The contents of blood TDP, <b>thiamine</b> <b>monophosphate</b> (TMP), and <b>thiamine,</b> {{as well as the}} activities of thiamine diphosphatase (TDPase), thiamine monophosphatase (TMPase), and thiamine pyrophosphokinase (TPK), were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography. Blood TDP contents of AD patients were significantly lower than those in control subjects (79. 03 ± 23. 24 vs. 127. 60 ± 22. 65 nmol/L, P 0. 05). Blood TDP levels correlated negatively with TDPase activities (r = - 0. 2576, P = 0. 0187) and positively with TPK activities (r = 0. 2426, P = 0. 0271) in all participants. Enhanced TDPase and TMPase activities may contribute to the reduction of TDP level in AD patients. The results imply that an imbalance of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation related to thiamine and glucose metabolism may be a potential target for AD prevention and therapy...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{intermittent}} light stimulation (ILS) {{on the distribution}} of thiamine derivatives in three brain areas (occipital, motor, and premotor) was compared in photosensitive and nonphotosensitive baboons. ILS induces paroxysmal discharges in the motor and premotor areas of photosensitive animals only. In baboons submitted to ILS, thiamine triphosphate (TTP) decreases in both photosensitive and nonphotosensitive animals; <b>thiamine</b> <b>monophosphate</b> (TMP) increases in photosensitive animals, which present ILS-induced paroxysmal discharges, whereas it is unaffected in nonphotosensitive animals. The variations are the most significant in the occipital (visual) cortex. A consumption of TTP may result from electrical activity induced by light stimulation in the occipital area. No correlation between ILS-induced paroxysmal activity and a decrease in TTP contents was found. However, photosensitive animals are affected differently from nonphotosensitive animals, as their content of TMP in the cerebral cortex increases on stimulation. However, as long as the exact role of thiamine compounds in relation to membrane excitability in the nervous system remains unknown, it is impossible to conclude whether the differences observed in the metabolism of thiamine compounds are the cause or the consequence of the photosensitivity in the baboon Papio papio.

40|$|Abstract — The {{effects of}} acute ethanol {{administration}} on different steps of <b>thiamine</b> (T), <b>thiamine</b> <b>monophosphate</b> (TMP) and pyrosphosphate (TPP) metabolism were determined in vivo in nervous tissues (cerebral cortex, cerebellum, brain stem and sciatic nerve) {{and in other}} tissues (small intestinal mucosa, kidney, heart, skeletal muscle and liver) of rats. The radioactivity of T and its phosphoesters in plasma and tissues was determined under steady-state conditions and at fixed time intervals (0. 25 - 24 hr) after an i. p. injection of Thiazole-[2 - 14 C]-thiamine (30 fig: 1. 25 uCi) {{in the presence of}} a constant plasma ethanol concentration (37 mM; 1. 75 g-r 1) produced by repeated intragastric administration of ethanol. Control animals received water intragastrically. Ethanol-treated rats and controls were starved, with water ad libitum during the 24 hr study period. Data were evaluated by using appropriate compartmental models, which allowed calculation of fractional rate constants, turnover rates and turnover times. In nervous tissues ethanol enhanced TMP entry (without affecting T entry or T and TMP release), reduced turnover time of total T and TPP, caused an almost general enhancement of TPP dephosphorylation without affecting T pyrophosphorylation, and increased markedly T content in the mixture released by tissues. Overall, ethanol appeared to enhance exchanges of...|$|R
40|$|An isocratic HPLC {{procedure}} {{for the assessment}} of <b>thiamine</b> (T), <b>thiamine</b> <b>monophosphate</b> (TMP) and <b>thiamine</b> diphosphate (TDP) in human erythrocytes is described. Several aspects of the procedure make it suitable for both clinical and research purposes: limits of detection and quantification of 1 and 2. 5 nmol/l, respectively, recovery of 102 % on average (range 93 - 112 %), intra- and inter-day precisions within 5 and 9 %, respectively, total elution time 15 min. This analytical methodology was applied to a case-control study on erythrocyte samples from 103 healthy subjects and 36 alcohol-dependent patients at risk of thiamine deficiency. Mean control values obtained were: T = 89. 6 +/- 22. 7 nmol/l, TMP = 4. 4 +/- 6. 6 nmol/l and TDP = 222. 23 +/- 56. 3 nmol/l. T and TDP mean values of alcoholics were significantly lower than those of control cases: T = 69. 4 +/- 35. 9 nmol/l (P < 0. 001) and TDP = 127. 4 +/- 62. 5 nmol/l (p < 10 (- 5)). The diagnostic role of TDP was evaluated and a significant role for thiamine was established in the study of alcohol related problems. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{analyses}} {{have suggested}} that the pyrimidine moiety of thiamine can be synthesized independently of the first enzyme of de novo purine synthesis, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (PurF), in Salmonella typhimurium. To obtain biochemical evidence for and to further define this proposed synthesis, stable isotope labeling experiments were performed with two compounds, [2 - 13 C]glycine and [13 C]formate. These compounds are normally incorporated into thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) via steps in the purine pathway subsequent to PurF. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses indicated that both of these compounds were incorporated into the pyrimidine moiety of TPP in a purF mutant. This result clearly demonstrated that the pyrimidine moiety of thiamine was being synthesized {{in the absence of the}} PurF enzyme and strongly suggested that this synthesis utilized subsequent enzymes of the purine pathway. These results were consistent with an alternative route to TPP that bypassed only the first enzyme in the purine pathway. Experiments quantitating cellular <b>thiamine</b> <b>monophosphate</b> (TMP) and TPP levels suggested that the alternative route to TPP did not function at the same capacity as the characterized pathway and determined that levels of TMP and TPP in the wild-type strain were significantly altered by the presence of purines in the medium...|$|R
40|$|In animals, <b>thiamine</b> <b>monophosphate</b> (TMP) is an {{intermediate}} {{on the path}} of thiamine diphosphate, the coenzyme form of vitamin B 1, degradation. The enzymes involved in TMP metabolism in animal tissues are not identified hitherto. The aim of this work was to study TMP hydrolysis in chicken liver. Two phosphatases have been found to contribute to TMP hydrolysis in liver homogenate. The first one, possessing a maximal activity at pH 6. 0, is soluble, whereas the second one represents a membrane-bound enzyme with a pH optimum of 9. 0. Membrane-bound TMPase activity was enhanced 1. 7 -fold by 5 mM Mg 2 + ions and strongly inhibited by levami­sole in uncompetitive manner with Ki of 53 μM, indicating the involvement of alkaline phosphatase. An apparent Km of alkaline phosphatase for TMP was calculated from the Hanes plot to be 0. 6 mM. The soluble TMPase has an apparent­ Km of 0. 7 mM; this enzyme is Mg 2 + independent and insensitive to levamisole. As estimated by gel filtration on a Toyopearl HW- 55 column, the soluble enzyme has a molecular mass of 17. 8 kDa, TMPase activity being eluted simultaneously with peaks of flavinmononucleotide and p-nitrophenyl phosphatase activity. Thus, TMP appears to be a physiological substrate for a low-molecular weight acid phosphatase, also known as low-molecu­lar-weight protein phosphotyrosine phosphatas...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{provision}} of {{high doses of}} thiamine may prevent thiamine deficiency in the post-partum period of displaced persons. Methodology/Principal Findings: The study aimed to evaluate a supplementation regimen of thiamine mononitrate (100 mg daily) at the antenatal clinics in Maela refugee camp. Women were enrolled during antenatal care and followed after delivery. Samples were collected at 12 weeks post partum. Thiamine diphosphate (TDP) in whole blood and thiamine in breast-milk of 636 lactating women were measured. Thiamine in breast-milk consisted of <b>thiamine</b> <b>monophosphate</b> (TMP) in addition to thiamine, with a mean TMP to total thiamine ratio of 63 %. Mean whole blood TDP (130 nmol/L) and total thiamine in breast-milk (755 nmol/L) were within the upper range reported for well-nourished women. The prevalence of women with low whole blood TDP (, 65 nmol/L) was 5 % and with deficient breast-milk total thiamine (, 300 nmol/L) was 4 %. Whole blood TDP predicted both breast-milk thiamine and TMP (R 2 = 0. 36 and 0. 10, p, 0. 001). A ratio of TMP to total thiamine $ 63 % {{was associated with a}} 7. 5 and 4 -fold higher risk of low whole blood TDP and deficient total breast-milk thiamine, respectively. Routine {{provision of}} daily 100 mg of thiamine mononitrate post-partum compared to the previous weekly 10 mg of thiamine hydrochloride resulted in significantly higher total thiamine in breast-milk. Conclusions/Significance: Thiamine supplementation for lactating women in Maela refugee camp is effective and shoul...|$|R
