5|$|As {{the world}} starts to globalize, it is {{accompanied}} by criticism of the current forms of globalization, which are feared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> corporate-led. As corporations become larger and multinational, their influence and interests go further accordingly. Being able to influence and own most media companies, {{it is hard to}} be able to publicly debate the notions and ideals that corporations pursue. Some choices that corporations take to make profits can affect people all over the world. Sometimes fatally.|$|E
5|$|The Almost Nearly Perfect People: The Truth About the Nordic Miracle is a 2014 nonfiction book by the British {{journalist}} Michael Booth. In the book, Booth {{focuses on}} the five Nordic countries—Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Finland and Sweden—dedicating {{a section of the}} book to each one. He began writing the book after migrating from England to Denmark, based on his perceptions of the Nordic region before and after moving. He wanted to present an alternative perspective to the extremely positive depiction of the region in British media. The book received mixed reviews: some critics found it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> critical with poor humour, others praised its tone and informativeness.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of the debate, the Grimms' {{stories have}} {{continued}} to be resilient and popular around the world, although a recent study in England appears to suggest that parents consider the stories <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> violent and inappropriate for young children, writes Libby Copeland for Slate. Nevertheless, children remain enamored with grim stories as the recent success of The Grimm Series by Adam Gidwitz and The Sisters Grimm by Michael Buckley illustrates.|$|E

25|$|In 1944, Louis Waldman {{published}} his first autobiography, Labor Lawyer, {{in which he}} laid out his defense of the positions he had taken in his political career. Among other things, Waldman became very critical of the New Deal, considering it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> accommodating to the Communists and exhibiting certain authoritarian tendencies, somewhat echoing the critique of the old right. He was particularly alarmed by the integration of trade unions into the state apparatus that began to occur during World War II.|$|E
25|$|Opened {{with natural}} grass in 1967, {{the field was}} {{switched}} to AstroTurf and lights were added for its third season in 1969. After seven years, it was replaced with new AstroTurf in 1976. Sand-based OmniTurf was installed in 1984 and 1991, and infilled NeXturf in 2001. The NeXturf was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> slick when wet and lasted only one season, and was transferred to an intramural field. FieldTurf made its debut in Autzen in 2002, and was replaced in 2010.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} months of the occupation, new {{officials}} were appointed to several local and regional positions (e.g., mayors, governors, local councils). The officials were chosen from a select group of individuals (including ex-Ba'ath party officials) in an attempt to speed the return to normality and to avoid the election of people opposed to the American and British presence. Certain religious clerics and other officials were considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> radical or dangerous. On occasion the appointed officials were found to behave less than admirably. On 30 June 2003, the appointed mayor of Najaf was arrested on charges of corruption.|$|E

25|$|Other {{painters}} {{were critical}} of Ōkyo's style. They found it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> concerned with physical appearances, alleging {{that he was}} too beholden to the real world and produced undignified works. Nevertheless, his style proved popular with the public, and commissions came in to do Western-style landscapes, decorative screens, and nudes. He did life drawings and used them for material in his paintings. Ōkyo was probably the first Japanese artist to do life drawings from nude models. The subject was still considered pornographic in Japan. During his career he painted for wealthy merchants, the shogunate, even the emperor.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the drum}} {{magazine}} provided significant firepower, in military service {{it was found}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> heavy and bulky, especially when slung on the shoulder while marching. The M1928A1 Thompson drum magazine was rather fragile, and cartridges tended to rattle inside it, producing unwanted noise. For these reasons, the 20-round and later 30-round box magazines soon proved most popular with military users of the M1928A1, and drum compatibility {{was not included in}} the design of the wartime M1 and M1A1 models. The Thompson was one of the earliest submachine guns to incorporate a double-column, double-feed box magazine design, which undoubtedly contributed to the gun's reputation for reliability. In addition, the gun performed better than most after exposure to rain, dirt, and mud.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Yang Yuqing, Yang Rushi, Yang Yuqing's brother Yang Han'gong (楊漢工), Zhang Yuanfu (張元夫), and Xiao Huan (蕭澣) were {{perceived}} by Emperor Wenzong <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> eager in their partisanship, {{and he began}} to dislike them. After he made Li Deyu chancellor in 833, Li Deyu used Emperor Wenzong's dislike for these officials to begin ejecting Niu Faction officials from the government. Li Zongmin responded by having Zheng Tan, who was then imperial scholar, removed from his post as imperial scholar—but Emperor Wenzong reacted by promoting Zheng to be the chief imperial censor without consulting Li Zongmin, which caused Li Zongmin to be angry and fearful. Soon thereafter, Li Zongmin himself was sent out to Shannan West Circuit (山南西道, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi), to serve as its military governor.|$|E

25|$|The {{club was}} not keen on repeating the {{disaster}} of 1991–92, {{and in the}} next season Bayern spent the equivalent of €12 million on the new players—Thomas Helmer (€4M), Brazil's captain Jorginho (€2.8M) and Lothar Matthäus (€2M) topped the bill of a list that also included Mehmet Scholl. Calming the nerves of the thrifty President Dr. Fritz Scherer, an economics professor at the University of Munich, was the sale of Stefan Effenberg and Brian Laudrup for €8.5 million to Fiorentina. The rebuilt side came close to winning the title, but just missed out. Ribbeck's tactics, which were felt <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> negative, were blamed for this, and when the following season looked to be going no differently, Beckenbauer dismissed Ribbeck and took control of the team himself. An immediate upturn in form saw Bayern take that year's title.|$|E
25|$|Noelle is a brown-haired {{young woman}} who {{initially}} serves as 'leader' of the girls in Billings House. Fiercely loyal to her friends, she is the implied counterpart to Reed, being similarly skilled in lacrosse and soccer, and apparently coming from a shaken family of her own. However, her privileged upbringing tends to make her blunt and sometimes insensitive, as she enjoys intimidating other {{students as well as}} the Easton staff. She is shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> self-confident to the point of arrogance, but very intelligent. According to some of her peers, she cannot live without drama in her life. Noelle possesses a long, red scar along her stomach, just above her hipbone from a childhood horseback riding accident. She has an unstable longtime romantic relationship with another senior named Dash McCafferty. As the series progresses, Noelle becomes Reed's best friend and ally. Later in the series, facts about Noelle's family are revealed and it is discovered that Noelle is Reed's paternal half-sister.|$|E
25|$|Under Bill Ford's direction, Ford Motor Company made {{technological}} progress toward improving fuel efficiency, {{with the introduction}} of the Hybrid Electric Escape, the most fuel efficient SUV on the market, achieving 36 mpg (EPA) in city driving. The Escape's platform mates Mercury Mariner and Mazda Tribute are also scheduled to receive hybrid-electric powertrain options, along with other upcoming vehicles in the Ford product line including the Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan. Ford announced that half of the vehicle lineup will be available with advanced hybrid-electric powerplant options by 2010, although the Company's earlier pledge to build 250,000 hybrid vehicles a year by 2010 proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> optimistic, and had to be abandoned. Ford also continues to study Fuel Cell-powered electric powertrains, and is currently demonstrating hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine technologies, as well as developing the next-generation hybrid-electric systems. In addition, to the Ford Escape, Hybrid Escape, Mercury Mariner, and Mazda Tribute, Ford is currently marketing high efficiency crossover SUVs such as the Ford Freestyle, and the Volvo XC70 and Volvo XC90. Ford is also developing sporty new crossover SUVs, such as the Ford Edge, Lincoln MKX, and Mazda CX-7.|$|E

500|$|Scouting and Boy Scouts {{are well}} known {{throughout}} American culture.

Critical {{response}} was mostly positive, with praise going to the episode's action and the cast's chemistry, but several story elements were criticized as forced. The S.H.I.E.L.D. announcement was seen <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> ambitious for the series given the MCU films are considered unlikely to ever acknowledge it.|$|E
500|$|Rosidi {{writes that}} Soeman's {{greatest}} strength in Kawan Bergeloet {{is in his}} description.

Rosidi considers some of the stories' comic incidents <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> complicated, but attributes this to Soeman's previous activity in the detective genre. The Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw finds the sketches in Kawan Bergeloet to be [...] "well-observed and realistically described" [...] and Soeman's most interesting contribution to Indonesian literature.|$|E

500|$|Sifton was {{selected}} Premier {{in an effort}} to restore party unity, and his first cabinet reflected that. [...] There were three ministers in addition to Sifton. [...] Charles R.

[...] Duncan Marshall had been a Rutherford cabinet minister, but not one identified strongly with its railway policy. [...] Archibald J. McLean had voted with the rebels, but not been a leader among them. [...] The cabinet thus included members of both factions, but none of those who inspired such strong opinions as <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> divisive.|$|E
500|$|Kulash {{noted that}} their largest [...] "nightmare" [...] for {{the machine was}} a set of mousetraps, {{triggered}} to release a display of colored flags; they were found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> sensitive to earlier actions of the machine, such as the dropping of a piano, and redesign and padding were needed to prevent the traps from being set off prematurely. The timing had {{to take into account}} the movements of both the band members and the cameraman; Damien Kulash estimated that though the machine was able to complete its opening at least three times, these shots were botched, because either the band members or the cameraman had fallen behind the action of the machine.|$|E
500|$|The Chicago Tribunes Sid Smith {{found the}} film to be [...] "pretty lousy, despite a wealth of {{impressive}} special effects that end with {{an image of a}} completely demolished Chicago skyline." [...] He found the plot <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> melodramatic and [...] "hokey" [...] with an excessive amount of coincidences and ill-fortunes thrown at the characters, despite the performances of the star-studded cast. Australia's The Age gave the film a slightly more favorable review, praising the stunts and special effects, though it noted the effects suffer from poor computer editing and referred to the film as [...] "a little entertaining supertrash" [...] that does require one to not think too much about the science to enjoy.|$|E

5000|$|One {{important}} phenomenon {{occurring in}} common value auctions is the winner's curse. Bidders have only {{estimates of the}} value of the good. If, on average, bidders are estimating correctly, the highest bid will tend <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> placed by someone who overestimated the good's value. This is an example of adverse selection, similar to the classic [...] "lemons" [...] example of Akerlof. Rational bidders will anticipate the adverse selection, so that even though their information will still turn out <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>overly</b> optimistic when they win, they do not pay too much on average.|$|R
