40|$|Debates over {{equality}} in New Guinea have raged for years. While people may subscribe to egalitarian values, this seems hollow to some {{observers in the}} context of relations between women and men, notably the sexual division of labour. Some even talk of men exploiting the labour of women. This paper considers the validity of these claims in the Was valley of the Southern Highlands Province, using data collected in a <b>time-budget</b> <b>survey</b> conducted to document and assess differences between women’s and men’s activities. It also reviews ideas of time expended undertaking any activity, and the relevance of notions of work and labour to people’s daily routines. It questions the propriety of introducing the capitalism’s preoccupation with labour. Differences in the activities of women and men far from evidencing relations of inequality are significant for such stateless political orders in eschewing hierarchical arrangements, where no one exercises control over resources or capital needed by others to secure livelihoods...|$|E
40|$|Drawing on {{data from}} a recent <b>time-budget</b> <b>survey,</b> this paper investigates the {{relationship}} between cultural consumption, specifically book readership, and social stratification in Hungary. Results show that status, education and income are the three main bases for stratification in book reading in this country. As could be expected from a Weberian standpoint, the effects of class on book reading and reading preferences are less marked than those of status. People's reading behaviour is strongly associated both with their own and with their parents' social status. The analyses suggest {{that in terms of}} stratification by education, income and status, the most salient dividing line is that between readers and non-readers. Further, only individuals {{at the top of the}} status hierarchy possess an adequate amount of educational and financial resources to consume the most 'canonised' forms of culture; in this case, serious literature and work-related non-fiction texts.

40|$|Objectives: Most {{research}} on falls among older persons focuses on health-related {{factors that affect}} the ability to maintain balance. The objective {{of the study is}} to determine the association between physical activity and occurrence of falls among community-dwelling older persons. Methods: The distribution of falls and person-hours of physical activity in the home over 24 h was compared. The falls data (n = 501) were extracted from a pooled dataset of three follow-up studies conducted between 1994 and 2005 (n = 3587). The 1995 Dutch National <b>Time-Budget</b> <b>Survey</b> provided hour-by-hour information on activities performed by older individuals (n = 459) in the home; this sample was representative for the Netherlands. The association between the 24 -h distribution of falls and physical activity and the risk of falling (the ratio between the distribution of falls and physical activity) were determined. Participants were community-dwelling older persons aged 65 years and older. Results: More physical activity was positively associated with more falls (Spearman correlation =. 89, p <. 000). The risk of falling at night (1 a. m. - 6 a. m.) was almost eight times higher compared to 7 a. m. - 12 p. m. Conclusions: Physical activity is strongly associated with the number of falls in the home, measured over 24 h. Older persons may be at increased risk of falling if they are encouraged to become more physically active, or if they often get out of bed at night. Thus in addition to health-related factors, changes in level of physical activity should also be taken into account when estimating a person's risk of falling. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|As a {{planning}} and research tool, the time budget is sadly neglected and falls far short of its potential. Existing studies that apply to this methodology are limited in their focus on human activities and have overlooked time budgets {{as a means of}} comparing the life styles of people in different living environments. The results of two <b>time-budget</b> <b>surveys</b> of residents in an urban-fringe squatter area and high-rise public flats in the Republic of Singapore are reported, stressing those aspects that, at best, are usually paid lip service. An analysis of the various ways in which people in these divergent living environments used their time reveals important contrasts in life styles. Implications for urban planners are briefly drawn. ...|$|R
40|$|Data were {{collected}} {{in order to gain}} insight in the way the Dutch population is spending its time. The data {{were collected}} by means of two interviews (a baseline questionnaire and a concluding questionnaire) and a time-budget diary completed by the same respondents. Previous <b>time-budget</b> <b>surveys</b> were held in 1995, 1990, 1985, 1980, and 1975, and a number of variables were recoded to make the surveys better accessible for comparative research. The TBO survey is a project by the SCP, Cebuco, the Publieke Omroep (NOS/Teleac/NOT), Universiteit van Tilburg and the Adviesdienst Verkeer en Vervoer.

40|$|Product {{diversity}} pervades every modern marketplace, {{and economists}} have devoted substantial attention to firms' {{decisions about the}} supply of variety. This study looks at the consumer's side by discussing the demand for variety. Using {{the framework of the}} home-production model, we trace differences in demand to differences in the opportunity costs of various activities. The cost differences are associated with investments in human capital; and the resulting differences in schooling attainment produce differences in time costs that in turn alter the kinds and variety of activities in which household members engage. Using <b>time-budget</b> <b>surveys</b> from Australia, Israel, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United States and West Germany from between 1985 and 1994, we find substantial differences among households in the extent of variety in the nonwork activities that they produce. More educated individuals generate more variety, engaging in both additional activities and the same ones as the less educated, with most of the effect of education on the variety of nonroutine activities. There is more variety on weekends; women engage in more different activities than men; young children add to variety in household consumption/production, especially among women; and income effects are clearly positive. ...|$|R
40|$|Drawing on {{data from}} a recent <b>time-budget</b> <b>survey,</b> this paper investigates the {{relationship}} between cultural consumption and social stratification in Hungary. Education continues to exert a powerful influence on cultural consumption {{just as it did}} under communism. A major change from the communist era is that cultural consumption is now also strongly affected by income. Social status exerts an effect on cultural participation, although not one as straightforward as expected. The probability of being active rather than inactive does rise with individuals’ status in a rather steep linear fashion. But individuals’ status does not have any significant influence in differentiating among types of cultural consumer. However, what does appear as a significant influence in this regard is the father’s status. This latter finding suggests that in post-communist Hungary the direct intra-familial transmission of inequalities is becoming a yet more powerful process than before. The analyses suggest that in terms of stratification by education, income and status, the most salient dividing line is that between actives and inactives. As regards the types of consumer, three groups have emerged from these analyses: univores, exclusives and omnivores. Univores – who are in general at the lowest status level in other countries – seem to have been to some extent displaced 'upwards' by the unusually large numbers of the culturally inactive. Exclusives can hardly be taken as forming a social as well as a cultural elite; rather they appear to be the remains of the ‘intelligentsia’ of the communist era. If there is, in present-day Hungarian society, a pattern of cultural consumption that can be associated with socially more advantaged groups, it is that of the omnivores...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – Aims {{to provide}} new {{evidence}} about gender differentials in domestic work time, market work time and total work time, that updates the evidence provided by Jenkins and O’Leary in 1997 and Layte in 1999 using UK <b>time-budget</b> <b>surveys.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Investigates gender differentials in work times using the British Household Panel survey (BHPS). The BHPS is a nationally representative longitudinal data set consisting of some 5, 500 households (and 10, 000 individuals) first interviewed {{in the autumn}} of 1991 and followed and re-interviewed every year subsequently. Findings – The picture that emerges from the BHPS data is a rather “traditional ” and well-known one. On average, women (be them married or single) work more at home and less in the labour market than men. The comforting side of this pessimistic conclusion, is that the trends in domestic and paid work time over the 1990 s show a narrowing in the gender differentials, thanks mainly to the changing behaviour of women and not of men. Originality/value – An important message that seems to emerge is that women are far more flexible than men. That is, men hardly react or change their behaviour in front of (certain) situations that clearly affect women’s time allocation decisions (e. g. presence of children, cohort effects). Finally, the paper identifies and characterises the men who do better at home in relative terms: the “new ” men...|$|R
