50|$|Some objective-based games use fixed spawns defended by, for example, {{automated}} turrets to help spawn camping. Sometimes players camp at spawn points just to kill <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>who</b> run by there, this {{is known}} as 'spawnkilling' and is particularly performed against new and inexperienced <b>players.</b> <b>Players</b> <b>who</b> do this are likely to be targeted by <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>who</b> killed them.|$|R
5|$|Enforcers {{sometimes}} start {{fights to}} build game momentum {{and provide a}} psychological advantage over the opposing team. These fights usually involve two enforcers, but may involve any player who is agitating the opposition. This type of fight raises morale on the team of <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>who</b> wins, and often excites the home crowd. For that reason, {{it can also be}} a gamble to start a fight for momentum; if an enforcer loses the fight, the momentum can swing the wrong way.|$|E

5|$|Ripken's power, {{which led}} to records such as most home runs by a shortstop and 13th place in career doubles, had consequences.

5|$|As in the {{original}} Tekken Tag Tournament, matches involve each player selecting two fighters to fight with. Players are able to switch their fighters out at any time, allowing the inactive character to gradually recover some life they might have lost.

If the life bar of either of a player's fighters runs out, that player loses the round. If time runs out, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>who</b> has the most cumulative life remaining amongst their fighters wins the round.|$|E
