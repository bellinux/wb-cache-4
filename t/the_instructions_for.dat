5|$|In September 1765, Adams {{was once}} again {{appointed}} by the Boston Town Meeting to write <b>the</b> <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> Boston's delegation to the Massachusetts House of Representatives. As it turned out, he wrote his own instructions; on September 27, the town meeting selected him to replace the recently deceased Oxenbridge Thacher as one of Boston's four representatives in the assembly. James Otis was attending the Stamp Act Congress in New York City, so Adams was the primary author {{of a series of}} House resolutions against the Stamp Act, which were more radical than those passed by the Stamp Act Congress. Adams {{was one of the first}} colonial leaders to argue that mankind possessed certain natural rights that governments could not violate.|$|E
5|$|It {{was hoped}} by Stuart and Rainer that the Batavian {{governor}} Johan Van Angelbeek might {{be persuaded to}} allow a peaceful occupation of Ceylon by British forces, {{especially in light of}} the Kew Letters from William of Orange, which advocated cooperation with British forces. A Major Agnew was sent ashore at Colombo to negotiate and his attempts to persuade Van Angelbeek to allow 300 British troops to land at Fort Oostenberg, which overlooked Trincomalee, were successful. On arrival off the port on the eastern coast of Ceylon on 1 August however the commander of the defences refused to acknowledge the instruction, citing problems with the wording of <b>the</b> <b>instructions.</b> <b>For</b> two days attempts were made to convince the Batavian commander, the British position partially undermined by the destruction of Diomede in Trincomalee harbour after striking an uncharted rock. Although all of the crew and passengers were saved, large quantities of military stores sank with the frigate.|$|E

40|$|The Endurant stent-graft (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) is a latest {{generation}} device {{for the treatment}} of abdominal aortic aneurysm. The idea behind designing such a graft came from the intention to broad <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> <b>for</b> use (IFU) and to enable it to treat more challenging anatomy including the 10 mm neck lengths, and more severe suprarenal and infrarenal angulations. Endurant stent-graft has active fixation through suprarenal stent with anchoring pins to provide migration resistance, optimized heights of stents and spacing between them for improved flexibility and conformability, low-profile delivery system with hydrophilic coating and controlled simple deployment mechanism. Short term results are excellent. Technical and clinical success is confirmed in Regulatory trials (EU and USA), as well as in ENGAGE and the Canadian registry. Many current publications record the use of Endurant stent-graft outside <b>the</b> <b>Instruction</b> <b>for</b> use. <b>The</b> results in a group of patients outside <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> <b>for</b> use are comparable to those within <b>instruction</b> <b>for</b> use; with <b>the</b> exception of perioperative proximal endoleak type I. Mid-term results are consistent with short-term results. The long-term results are lacking...|$|R

25|$|The Pāli Canon, {{which dates}} to 1st century BCE {{considers}} Indian Buddhist meditation {{as a step}} towards liberation. By the time Buddhism was spreading in China, the Vimalakirti Sutra which dates to 100 CE included a number of passages on meditation, clearly pointing to Zen (known as Chan in China, Thiền in Vietnam, and Seon in Korea). The Silk Road transmission of Buddhism introduced meditation to other Asian countries, and in 653 the first meditation hall was opened in Singapore.

25|$|The CIA Deer gun was a single-shot 9×19 mm Parabellum pistol, {{made by the}} U.S. {{during the}} Vietnam War. It was {{packaged}} with three rounds of ammunition in the grip, and packed with instructions in a plastic box. If air-dropped into water, the plastic box containing the pistol would float. Like the earlier FP-45 Liberator, it was designed primarily for assassination of enemy soldiers, with the intention {{that it would be}} replaced by an enemy soldier's left-over equipment. <b>The</b> <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> the Deer Gun were pictorial, with text in Vietnamese.|$|E

25|$|The elector {{authorised}} a visitation of the church, a power formerly {{exercised by}} bishops. At times, Luther's practical reforms {{fell short of}} his earlier radical pronouncements. For example, <b>the</b> <b>Instructions</b> <b>for</b> the Visitors of Parish Pastors in Electoral Saxony (1528), drafted by Melanchthon with Luther's approval, stressed the role of repentance in the forgiveness of sins, despite Luther's position that faith alone ensures justification. The Eisleben reformer Johannes Agricola challenged this compromise, and Luther condemned him for teaching that faith is separate from works. The Instruction is a problematic document for those seeking a consistent evolution in Luther's thought and practice.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of a horse's skin, eye, and coat-color is determined by pigment chemicals called melanins. Two types of melanins are used by mammals, such as horses and humans: eumelanin, which is visually black to brown, and phaeomelanin, visually red to yellow. Specialized cells in the skin and eyes, melanocytes or pigment cells, produce melanins and deposit them into the skin and hair using complex chemical reactions. <b>The</b> <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> these chemical reactions are genetically encoded as DNA, and are therefore inherited. To be seal brown, a horse must {{have at least one}} copy of the functional MC1R gene (E/E or E/Ee) and must have one of the following genotypes at the Agouti locus: A/A or A/a.|$|E
25|$|It is 1972 and {{the message}} from the Andromeda Nebula has stopped transmitting. Fleming {{has been able to}} {{determine}} the correct formula to counteract the effects of the enzyme and save Dawnay. Fleming, Dawnay, Reinhart, and Judy now agree that Andromeda must be stopped – however, the military now has control over the project. Andromeda tries to kill Fleming but fails; she confesses to Fleming that she is a slave of the computer, which is working to take over humanity. Fleming gains entry to the computer room where he takes an axe to the machine, destroying it. Now free of the machine Andromeda is able to access the safe that contains the copies of the original message with <b>the</b> <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> building the computer which she burns so that the machine cannot be rebuilt. She flees with Fleming to one of the islands near the base. Pursued by soldiers, they hide in a series of caves on the island. However, Andromeda is apparently killed when she falls into a deep pool. The dejected Fleming is brought back to Thorness by the soldiers.|$|E

25|$|To {{break the}} last resistance, {{simultaneously}} with preparing the Meerapalu landing operation, Govorov ordered the 260th Independent Naval Infantry Brigade {{to prepare for}} an amphibious attack to the German rear in Narva. This was an elite unit, specially trained for an amphibious assault. They were transported to the Narva front by a navy unit of 26 vessels. The troops were to assault from the Gulf of Finland, landing several miles behind the German lines near the coastal settlement of Mereküla. The first company were to destroy the railway and Auvere station, the second company to occupy the railway east from Auvere, and the third company to cover the left flank and {{to blow up the}} railway bridge east of Auvere. Estonian sources claim that as <b>the</b> <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> later action, Major Maslov ordered to slaughter the civilians. Another amphibious unit was intended to land after them. However, Estonian Counterintelligence had acquired data on an amphibious operation being prepared to land in Mereküla in 1939. Preparing the Panther Line in 1944, the Germans placed their artillery on the coastal battery built by the Military of Estonia specifically against such a landing. The 517 troops commenced their operation on 14 February, landing {{directly in front of the}} German coastal artillery. The Norge Regiment and the coastal guards, supported by three Tiger tanks quickly responded. While the 2nd Shock Army artillery placed near Auvere failed to begin their attack at the agreed time, in seven and a half hours of fierce fighting, the Soviet beachhead was annihilated.|$|E

500|$|Descent rate is {{generally}} allowed for in decompression planning by assuming a maximum descent rate specified in <b>the</b> <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> {{the use of}} the tables, but it is not critical.
