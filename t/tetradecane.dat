40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 78 - 80) EPR {{spectra of}} dilute solutions of six nitroxide labeled <b>tetradecanes,</b> labeled at different {{positions on the}} alkyl chain, were studied in the hydrocarbon solvent cis-decalin {{as a function of}} temperature. Linewidth measurements of the three 14 N hyperfine lines were used to calculate the rotational correlation times of the labeled portion of the molecules. Unresolved hyperfine coupling to protons in the labeled molecule gave rise to inhomogeneous broadening which was corrected after arriving at suitable proton hyperfine coupling constants using spectral simulations. The data could be equally well interpreted in terms of the Arrhenius equation or the Stokes-Einstein-Debye hydrodynamic model. The activation energies derived from the former exhibited an interesting oscillatory behavior {{as a function of the}} position of the spin label, demonstrating that the molecule does not rotate as a rigid body [...] that is, the molecule is flexible and the activation of segmental motion varies with the position of the spin label. At 30 ??C, the rotational correlation times decreased monotonically as a function of the spin label distance from the center of the molecule. The hydrodynamic interpretation of the results led to an effective radius for each of the spin labels. These experimentally determined radii were compared rather successfully with the results of a very crude model which pictures the rotation of the nitroxide label as being due to the independent rotation of the segment containing the nitroxide and the rotation of the entire molecule. The Heisenberg spin exchange frequency of one of the labels was measured and compared with the prediction of the Stokes-Einstein relation. The 13 C satellite intensities were measured and discussed in terms of the number of carbon sites involved in hyperfine coupling with the unpaired electron...|$|R

The investigators performed enrichment and incubation of collected samples in 20 ml volumes of crude oil and additional nutrients. After 2 months of enrichment at 4 °C, cultures were diluted in tubes containing solutions of mineral medium of type ONR7a that were additionally supplemented with more crude light oil. These tube cultures were then incubated in darkness until turbidity (which was used to indicate bacterial growth changes over some period of time) became high enough to indicate saturated growth samples (which took approximately 2 months). These cultures were then diluted and the most diluted cultures (10−4) with positive growth were plated on solid form ONR7a mineral medium that also contained <b>tetradecane</b> (a 14 carbon hydrocarbon). After 15 days and further incubation at 4 °C, the investigators retrieved individual colonies.|$|E

JSME, 60 - 580 (1994), 4236. ]. In this report, {{in order to obtain}} practical data for industrial application, nondimensional analysis of the solidification rate of the <b>tetradecane</b> oil droplets and the overall heat transfer coefficient in the freezer was carried out. In this system, the <b>tetradecane</b> oil droplets change from liquid to solid state during ascension in the cold heat transfer medium. Therefore, liquid-liquid and solid-liquid coexisting-type direct-contact heat transfer occurs between the <b>tetradecane</b> oil droplets and the aqueous solution. It can be considered that the flow pattern and heat transfer process are different for the liquid-liquid and the solid-liquid systems. The empirical equations of the solidification rate and the overall heat transfer coefficient were derived for the averaged values for the entire freezer. The optimum operating conditions at which the maximum solidification rate can be achieved were clarified. 前報において、直接接触による潜熱蓄冷システムを提案し、その構築のための基礎的データを報告した。すなわち、テトラデカン油（C 14 H 10 、融点Tm= 5. 8 ℃、融解潜熱L= 229. 1 kj/kg、密度Ρdl= 770 kg/m 3 (液相時、 6 ℃) ）およびエチレングリコール水溶液をそれぞれ蓄冷材および低温冷媒液として用い、両者を直接接触させることによる。蓄冷材の凝固挙動について明らかにした。通常、テトラデカン油の噴射温度および水溶液温度を低下させるに伴い、増加する傾向にある。しかし、温度条件を極度に低下させると、ノズル先端にてテトラデカン油の凍結が起こり、いわゆる凝固油柱が発生し、逆に温度の低下と共に、凝固率が減少するという特徴的な現象を見い出した。また、本蓄冷システムにおいては、蓄冷部にて蓄冷材としての油滴が液相から固相へと凝固相変化するため、液－液および固－液系の直接接触熱交換が共存することになり、それぞれ異なった伝熱形態となる。本報告では、テトラデカン油滴群の凝固率および熱伝達率を主に実験データを基礎に整理する方法を検討するものである。前述したように、実験条件によりノズル先端に凝固油柱が形成される場合とされない場合があり、それぞれの場合における実験整理式の提案と本蓄冷システムの最適な運転条件についての考察を行っている...|$|E

Simultaneous production and extraction, is an integrated process of milking that involves cultivation of C. vulgaris {{under the influence of}} dodecane and <b>tetradecane</b> within the aqueous-organic biphase system and the extraction of intracellular lipids. Different concentrations (10 % v/v, 15 % v/v, and 20 % v/v) of dodecane and <b>tetradecane</b> were used for the extraction of lipid. The highest lipid amount (1175 ± 34 mg/L) within the solvent phase was achieved with maximum lipid recovery ratio of 47 ± 5 % during first cycle when 20 % concentration of dodecane was used as the solvent. In addition maximum cell dehydrogenase activity (4. 5 ± 0. 5 OD 492 g− 1 cell) and growth rate (1. 8 d− 1) were also observed under 20 % dodecane. The presence of higher concentration of <b>tetradecane</b> lowers the dehydrogenase activity thus resulting in lower lipid extraction under milking. Solvent recovery ratio was 12 % higher under 20 % dodecane as compared to 10 % of <b>tetradecane.</b> Growth profile study of C. vulgaris showed an overall increase in the lipid content when the cultures were extended up to four cycles.

In both high- and low-coverage structures the molecules have their extended axes parallel to the surface. The plane of the carbon skeleton is found to be parallel to the graphite surface. The monolayers at sub-monolayer coverages are interpreted as uniaxially commensurate while those monolayers coexisting with the liquid are fully commensurate. Dodecane and <b>tetradecane</b> are exceptional: dodecane forms additional phases at high temperatures just prior to melting, at both low and high coverages.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The use {{of copper}} radioisotopes in imaging and therapy {{applications}} {{has created a}} greater need for bifunctional chelates (BFCs) for complexing copper radioisotopes to biomolecules. It has been demon-strated that the charge and lipophilicity of the Cu-BFC complex has {{a significant effect on}} the in vivo behavior of the radiolabeled Cu-BFC-biomolecule conjugate. To evaluate the effects of charge, stability, and macrocyclic backbone size on the biological behavior of 64 Cu complexes, a series of macrocyclic 64 Cu complexes have been prepared, and the biodistributions of these agents were evaluated in normal Sprague-Dawley rats. Two macrocyclic backbones, dodecane and <b>tetradecane,</b> were evaluated; cyclen, DOTA, and DO 2 A were dodecane backbone derivatives, and cyclam, TETA, and et-cyclam were <b>tetradecane</b> backbone derivatives.

Erythema, epidermal thickness, and epidermal cell layers were quantitated. No erythema was noted in 1 -day in vivo HC exposures but significant erythema was observed in 4 -day tridecane, <b>tetradecane,</b> pentadecane, and JP- 8 exposed sites. The aromatic HCs did not produce any macroscopic lesions in 1 or 4 days of in vivo exposures. Morphological observations revealed slight intercellular and intracellular epidermal edema in 4 -day exposures with the aliphatic HCs. Epidermal thickness and number of cell layers significantly increased (p < 0. 05) in tridecane, <b>tetradecane,</b> pentadecane, and JP- 8 -treated sites.

Here we present a set of new bacterial bioreporters and assays that allow to detect long-chain alkanes. These reporters are based on the regulatory protein AlkS and the alkB 1 promoter from Alcanivorax borkumensis SK 2, a widespread alkane degrader in marine habitats. Escherichia coli cells with the reporter construct reacted strongly to octane in short-term (6 h) aqueous suspension assays but very slightly only to <b>tetradecane,</b> in line with what is expected from its low water solubility. In contrast, long-term assays (up to 5 days) with A. borkumensis bioreporters showed strong induction with <b>tetradecane</b> and crude oil.

40|$|Inadequacies {{of current}} {{recovery}} and disposal methods for mixed plastic wastes drive {{the exploration of}} viable strategies for plastics resource recovery. The combination of diminishing landfill space and increasing usage of plastic products poses a significant dilemma, since current recovery methods are costly and ill-suited to handle contaminants. Coprocessing of polymeric waste with other materials may provide potential solutions to the deficiencies of current resource recovery methods, including unfavorable process economics. By incorporating plastic waste as a minor feed into an existing process, variations in supply and composition could be mediated, permitting continuous operation. One attractive option is the coprocessing of polymeric waste with coal under direct liquefaction conditions, allowing for simultaneous conversion of both feedstocks into high-valued products. Catalyst-directed coliquefaction of coal and polymeric materials not only has attractive environmental implications but also {{has the potential to}} enhance the economic viability of traditional liquefaction processes. By exploiting the higher H/C ratio of the polymeric material and using it as a hydrogen source, the overall process demand for molecular hydrogen and hydrogen donor solvents may be reduced. A series of model compound experiments has been conducted, providing a starting point for unraveling the complex chemistry underlying coliquefaction of coal and polymeric materials. <b>Tetradecane</b> (C{sub 14 } H{sub 30 }) was used as a polyethylene mimic, and 4 -(naphthylmethyl) bibenzyl (NBBM) was used as a coal model compound.

Osmotic stress of the HII phases did not detect a significantly different bending modulus (Kcp) for DOPS as compared to DOPE.

The counterion effect is also found to be strongly dependent upon <b>tetradecane</b> (TD) /chitosan (CS) ratio and ultrasonic power. Key observations are: (i) for a given TD/CS ratio, the size and size distribution decrease when the acid is varied from nitric acid to benzenesulfonic acid at high TD/CS ratio, and the effect becomes less significant at low TD/CS ratio; (ii) for a given acid, the size and size distribution increase with an increase in TD/CS ratio; and (iii) at low TD/CS ratio the size and size distribution are significantly influenced by the viscosity of the system. A possible mechanism for the observed counterion effect is proposed. The role of counterions, solution viscosity, and ultrasonic power in controlling the physical and functional properties of ultrasonically generated chitosan-stabilized <b>tetradecane</b> microspheres is discussed in detail. The key new finding of this study is that it is possible to form stable emulsions without the addition of external emulsifiers and stabilizers, but only using chitosan with different acids to dissolve chitosan. This strategy could be used in the generation of stable food emulsions...|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{initiated}} {{to characterize the}} acute and sub-chronic pulmonary responses to inhaled Jet-Propulsion Fuel 8 (JP- 8) aerosol. At 24 to 30 hours following JP- 8 exposure, physiological, biochemical, cellular, and morphological techniques were used to assay for lung injury. In addition, C 57 BL/ 6 and B 6. A. D. (Ahyd mice were utilized in the acute study to determine if responsiveness to aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) induction modulates toxicity. JP- 8 contains aromatic compounds that are known substrates for AHH. Acute lung injury was evident by increased respiratory permeability that was accompanied by alveolar macrophage infiltration and activation, following exposure to occupational permissible levels of JP- 8. Morphological alterations were characterized by terminal bronchiolar lesions of vacuolization and necrosis. AHH responsiveness {{did not appear to}} influence the severity of JP- 8 induced lung injury. Lung injury following sub-chronic inhalation was found to be progressive in nature. Repeated exposure induced alveolar hemorrhage and alveolar macrophage cytotoxicity. Morphological changes progressed to include epithelial denudation of bronchiolar airways and vacuolization of alveolar type II epithelial cells and adjacent endothelia. The pulmonary clearance of JP- 8 following inhalation exposures was determined indirectly by analysis for <b>tetradecane</b> content within lung homogenates from exposed mice. Clearance of JP- 8 following acute exposure was determined to have a half-life of 43 minutes and increased by 14 minutes following a toxic sub-chronic exposure. The relatively rapid pulmonary clearance of JP- 8 following either acute or sub-chronic exposure implies that JP- 8 induced lung injury was independent of pulmonary retention. Studies were also performed to determine if non-cytotoxic concentrations of JP- 8 or <b>tetradecane</b> could decrease bronchial epithelial barrier function. Studies showed that one hour of exposure to JP- 8 or <b>tetradecane</b> could significantly enhance paracellular permeability to mannitol in the BEAS- 2 B human bronchial epithelial cell line, at two hours after exposure. Bronchial epithelial permeability appeared to be more sensitive to <b>tetradecane</b> than JP- 8. Subsequent recovery studies determined that JP- 8 and tetradecane-induced decreases in barrier function reach a maximum at 12 hours and barrier function returns to control by 48 hours post-exposure. These results indicate that JP- 8 induced lung injury may be initiated by changes in airway barrier function...|$|E
40|$|Pullularia pullulans {{was tested}} {{for its ability}} to utilize a series of n-alkanes for growth. It {{utilized}} hydrocarbons containing higher C-numbers (13, 14, 16, and 18) to a greater degree than those containing lower numbers; in addition, an induction phenomenon was noted. Gas-liquid and thin-layer chromatography of ether extracts of the growth media revealed that oleic and palmitic acids were formed from tridecane, <b>tetradecane,</b> hexadecane, and octadecane...|$|E
40|$|Fraunhofer UMSICHT is {{investigating}} PCS systems {{in view of}} their possible application. Paraffin/water emulsion and encapsulated paraffin/water suspension are discussed as heat transfer fluid {{as an alternative to}} cold water. <b>Tetradecane</b> was chosen as paraffin for these fluids because of its melting point of 5 °C. Ice-slurries could be used as alternative tor brine or as cold storage fluid for a mobile cod supply...|$|E
40|$|An algal-bacterial {{consortium}} {{formed by}} Chlorella sorokiniana and a phenanthrene-degrading Pseudomonas migulae strain {{was able to}} biodegrade 200 - 500 mg/l of phenanthrene dissolved in silicone oil or <b>tetradecane</b> under photosynthetic conditions and without any external supply of oxygen. Phenanthrene was only removed when provided in organic solvent, which confirms the potential of two-phase systems for toxicity reduction. Phenanthrene was degraded at highest rates when provided in silicone oil rather than in <b>tetradecane</b> since this solvent probably sequestered the PAH, reducing its mass transfer to the aqueous phase. The influence of phenanthrene concentration, amount of inoculum and light intensity on pollutant removal was also investigated and, under the best conditions, phenanthrene was degraded at 24. 2 g mm 3 ·hm 1. In addition to being cost-effective and mitigating the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, photosynthetic oxygenation was especially beneficial {{to the use of}} two-phase partitioning bioreactors since it prevented solvent emulsification and/or volatilization and evidence was found that the microalgae release biosurfactants that could further enhance phenanthrene degradation...|$|E
