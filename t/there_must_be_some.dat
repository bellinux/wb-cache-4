25|$|Increased {{epinephrine}} secretion {{is observed}} in pheochromocytoma, hypoglycemia, myocardial infarction {{and to a}} lesser degree in benign essential familial tremor. A general increase in sympathetic neural activity is usually accompanied by increased adrenaline secretion, but there is selectivity during hypoxia and hypoglycaemia, when the ratio of adrenaline to noradrenaline is considerably increased.

25|$|Much of Hitchcock's {{supposed}} {{dislike of}} actors has been exaggerated. Hitchcock {{simply did not}} tolerate the method approach, as he believed that actors should only concentrate on their performances and leave work on script and character to the directors and screenwriters. In a Sight & Sound interview, he stated that, 'the method actor is OK in the theatre {{because he has a}} free space to move about. But when it comes to cutting the face and what he sees and so forth, <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> discipline'. He often used the same actors in many of his films.|$|E
25|$|As human {{machines}} {{being made}} up of cells controlled by our brain to influence aspects of our behaviour, <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> influence of biology on our consumer behaviour and how we purchase as well. The nature versus nurture debate {{is at the core}} of how much biology influences these buying decisions, because it argues the extent to which biological factors influence what we do, and how much is reflected through environmental factors. Neuromarketing is of interest to marketers in measuring the reaction of stimulus to marketing. Even though we know there is a reaction, the question of why we consume the way we do still lingers, but it is a step in the right direction. Biology helps to understand consumer behaviour as it influences consumption and aids in the measurement of it.|$|E

25|$|When Watson and Crick {{produced}} their {{double helix}} model of DNA, {{it was known}} {{that most of the}} specialized features of the many different life forms on Earth are made possible by proteins. Structurally, proteins are long chains of amino acid subunits. In some way, the genetic molecule, DNA, had to contain instructions for how to make the thousands of proteins found in cells. From the DNA double helix model, it was clear that <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> correspondence between the linear sequences of nucleotides in DNA molecules to the linear sequences of amino acids in proteins. The details of how sequences of DNA instruct cells to make specific proteins was worked out by molecular biologists during the period from 1953 to 1965. Francis Crick played an integral role in both the theory and analysis of the experiments that led to an improved understanding of the genetic code.|$|E
25|$|The Hartig net {{initially}} forms {{from the}} fully differentiated inner {{layer of the}} mantle, and penetration occurs in a broad front oriented transversally to the root axis, rather than from a single hyphae. As the hyphae contact the root cells and digest through the apoplastic space, some spruce (Picea abies) and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus) cells {{have been shown to}} produce chitinases and peroxidases that could inhibit Hartig net formation. Some plant cells exhibit transcripts for stress- and defense-related proteins such as pathogenesis-related and hypersensitive response-induced proteins. However, extensive root colonization still occurs in these plants, and the association {{does not seem to be}} met with massive cell death associated with pathogen limitation or defense gene activation. In fact, as the relationship develops in a compatible manner, these hallmarks of resistance seem to diminish by about day 21 after colonization. Thus, <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> sort of defense response suppression by the EcM fungi, though details concerning its nature and mechanisms have yet to be determined.|$|E
25|$|One of the theorems proved by Ramsey in his 1928 paper On {{a problem}} of formal logic now bears his name (Ramsey's theorem). While this theorem is the work Ramsey is {{probably}} best remembered for, he only proved it in passing, as a minor lemma {{along the way to}} his true goal in the paper, solving a special case of the decision problem for first-order logic, namely the decidability of what is now called the Bernays–Schönfinkel–Ramsey class of first-order logic, as well as a characterisation of the spectrum of sentences in this fragment of logic. Alonzo Church would go on to show that the general case of the decision problem for first-order logic is unsolvable (see Church's theorem). A great amount of later work in mathematics was fruitfully developed out of the ostensibly minor lemma, {{which turned out to be}} an important early result in combinatorics, supporting the idea that within some sufficiently large systems, however disordered, <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> order. So fruitful, in fact, was Ramsey's theorem that today there is an entire branch of mathematics, known as Ramsey theory, which is dedicated to studying similar results.|$|E

25|$|For {{the second}} part, {{consider}} a shortest path P (there {{may be more}} than one) from source to u with at most i edges. Let v be the last vertex before u on this path. Then, the part of the path from source to v is a shortest path from source to v with at most i-1 edges, since if it were not, then <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> strictly shorter path from source to v with at most i-1 edges, and we could then append the edge uv to this path to obtain a path with at most i edges that is strictly shorter than P -- a contradiction. By inductive assumption, v.distance after i−1 iterations is at most the length of this path from source to v. Therefore, uv.weight + v.distance is at most the length of P. In the ith iteration, u.distance gets compared with uv.weight + v.distance, and is set equal to it if uv.weight + v.distance was smaller. Therefore, after i iterations, u.distance is at most the length of P, i.e., the length of the shortest path from source to u that uses at most i edges.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} for the EGC is focused on freshwater fluxes. Because the EGC runs through the Greenland Sea and eventually through the Labrador Sea (as the West Greenland Current) it can have strong implications for the strengthening and or weakening of deep water formations in the Greenland and Labrador Seas. The Meridional Overturning Circulation is a density driven circulation in which a small perturbation in the density field could easily slow down or speed up the deep water formation in the Nordic Seas. Jones et al. note {{that there are three}} different freshwater sources for the EGC: Pacific water, river runoff, and sea-ice meltwater. They find that the biggest contributor to the freshening of the EGC is due to river runoff, followed by Pacific water, and a distant last is sea-ice meltwater (nearly negligible). They find that even though these sources freshen the EGC, these specific sources do not penetrate very well into the central Greenland Sea where the deep convection takes place. They then decide that <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> other freshwater influence in the central Greenland Sea. They believe it may be from solid sea ice being transported to the central Greenland Sea and then melting. Solid sea ice is very mobile, and winds can easily direct its flow along with ocean currents. Previous thoughts were that the recirculation of the EGC in the Greenland Sea via the Jan Mayen Fracture Zone helps lead to a freshening of the central Greenland Sea, however, Rudels et al. disproved this theory and said it must be due to solid sea ice melt and precipitation in the central Greenland Sea.|$|E

[...] When the Ecclesiastical History was written, Æthelbald of Mercia dominated the English south of the Humber, and Bede's view of the earlier kings was doubtless strongly coloured by the state of England at that time. [...] For the earlier bretwaldas, such as Ælle and Ceawlin, <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> element of anachronism in Bede's description.

500|$|A {{precondition}} {{for the formation}} of steam devils is the presence of a layer of moist air on the water with the misty air (called arctic steam fog) being drawn upwards into fog streamers (non-rotating columns of steam fog). [...] For this to happen the body of water must be unfrozen, and thus relatively warm, and <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> wind of cold, dry air to form the fog. [...] The cold air is warmed by the water and is humidified by evaporation. [...] The warmed air begins to rise, and as it does so is cooled adiabatically by the falling pressure causing the water vapour content to condense out into fog streamers.|$|E
500|$|In Taylor, {{a series}} of {{deliberate}} discovery violations by the defense counsel at trial led the trial judge to block attempts at postponing proceedings to allow a further undisclosed defense witness the chance to testify; the judge had held that <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> sanction against the defense for their failure to disclose witnesses earlier in the case. A divided Court upheld the trial judge's preclusion of the witness, adding a new framework for balancing a defendant's right to a robust defense with {{a series of}} other factors. Namely, the new framework required looking at the state's interest in [...] "efficient" [...] justice, the state's interest in excluding evidence lacking integrity, the state's interest in a strong judicial authority with followed rules, and the prosecution interest in avoiding prejudice due to a defendant's discovery violation.|$|E
500|$|For {{equitable}} tracing to be valid, {{several things}} must be demonstrated.

If the property was transferred through breach of trust, {{it will not be}} necessary to establish such a relationship, because it already exists. In addition, property transferred through breach of trust may be traced to any third party (other than a purchaser in good faith), even if they did not previously have a fiduciary relationship with the claimant. Historically, the courts have been willing to be [...] "generous in finding that the necessary fiduciary relationship existed", even {{going so far as to}} recognise relationships that did not exist at the time of the transfer.|$|E

500|$|The book explores {{a tension}} between {{originality}} and monoculture {{by focusing on the}} artist's relationship with a commercialized world and its marketing of free art and consumer products. Critic Lisa Zeidner argues that the artist's [...] "loyalty and love" [...] involved with creating originality counters Bigend's assertion that everything is a reflection of something else and that the creative process no longer rests with the individual. Commercialism is portrayed as a monoculture that assimilates originality. The Tommy Hilfiger brand is used as an example, [...] "simulacra of simulacra of simulacra. A dilute tincture of Ralph Lauren, who had himself diluted the glory days of Brooks Brothers, who themselves had stepped on the product of Jermyn Street and Savile Row ... <b>There</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> Tommy Hilfiger event horizon, beyond which it is impossible to be more derivative, more removed from the source, more devoid of soul." ...|$|E
500|$|Uroš Predić (1857–1953) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} 19th- and 20th-century Serbian realists. A native of Orlovat, a village in the Banat region of Austria-Hungary, Predić drew scenes of life in the village throughout his career. One of the more frequent sights during his stays there was of intoxicated young men returning from the pub at dawn and waking up the whole village. In painting the composition, Predić was not only attempting to realistically depict contemporary village life but also to convey a message. [...] "I observed this every day", he explained. [...] "I said to myself <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> way of telling these people to what an unhappy level they have descended and have a moral impact on them, capturing all the bad habits of my compatriots."
