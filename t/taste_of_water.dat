50|$|It is {{not clear}} when the first tetsubin kettles {{appeared}} in Japan, but one hypothesis is that {{the popularity of the}} tetsubin grew alongside sencha, a form of leaf tea. China introduced Japan to sencha around the middle of the 17th century. Sencha was not considered as formal as matcha, the common powdered green tea at the time. Throughout the 18th century, people started drinking sencha as an informal setting for sharing a cup of tea with friends or family. As more people drank sencha, the popularity of the tetsubin grew. The tetsubin is most probably not an original design, but rather shaped by other kettles around at the time. The five closest relatives to the tetsubin are the tedorikama, the toyama, the mizusosogi, the dobin, and the yakkan. The yakkan is the closest relative to the tetsubin, the main difference is that the yakkan is made from copper, whereas tetsubins are traditionally made out of iron. Some people have wondered why the tetsubin was developed, when a perfectly usable vessel such as the yakkan would have worked. Tea drinkers may have preferred the <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> from an iron kettle over the <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> from a copper kettle. Throughout the 18th century, tetsubin kettles became a standard household utensil for heating water to make tea with. As the use of these kettles increased, so too did the intricacy. During the 19th century, tetsubin designs went from simple basic iron kettles, to elaborately engraved masterpieces.|$|E

50|$|Dogs {{have around}} 1,700 taste buds {{compared}} to humans with around 9,000. The sweet taste buds in dogs {{respond to a}} chemical called furaneol which is found in many fruits and in tomatoes. It appears that dogs do like this flavor and it probably evolved because in a natural environment dogs frequently supplement their diet of small animals with whatever fruits happen to be available. Because of dogs' dislike of bitter tastes, various sprays, and gels {{have been designed to}} keep dogs from chewing on furniture or other objects. Dogs also have taste buds that are tuned for water, which is something they share with other carnivores but is not found in humans. This taste sense is found {{at the tip of the}} dog's tongue, which the part of the tongue that he curls to lap water. This area responds to water at all times but when the dog has eaten salty or sugary foods the sensitivity to the <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> increases. It is proposed that this ability to taste water evolved as a way for the body to keep internal fluids in balance after the animal has eaten things that will either result in more urine being passed or will require more water to adequately process. It certainly appears that when these special water taste buds are active, dogs seem to get an extra pleasure out of drinking water, and will drink copious amounts of it.|$|E

Water-falls - Pokali waterfalls attracts the tourists who are religious and loves natural beauty. If Pokali waterfall could be advertised within Nepal it would relief the public of Okhaldhunga. We can take an example of Pathibhara {{as a symbol of}} Devi temple in Taplejung district, the public in Ilam named it as Pathibhara. Visitors from Darjaling and Sikkim visit Pathibhara, this shows that if people have unity the work becomes successful. Gadhi - Historical corners “gadhi” are found to be constant. Repair and maintenance of gadhi could attract the tourist. Chasankhu gadhi of Diyale and Kotkateni gadhi of Thulachhap are also found to be not well taken care of. Cave - Cave has great significance throughout the world. Our ancestors used to live in the cave and wodhar? One of the most popular cave of Pokhara “Mahendra gufa” has demonstrated of attraction of tourist towards cave and wodhar [...] Chameru Gufa of Okhaldunga Bilandu has proved to be playground “kridasthal” of chameru. The darkness inside the chameru gufa makes it difficult for people to go inside. If proper arrangement could be done, travel would be convenient for the people in the district, and it would make it possible to collect the money as well. Religion- Okhaldhunga has a lot of religious conviction center. After Kathmandu the most faithful conviction center and ????? ?????? should be in Okhaldhunga district. The most popular Pokali water fall and forest shaman cave “ban-jhakri gufa” are found in the district, we have established an institution, “Pokali Jharana Sewa Samajh” to spread the information of these beauty and also to help the sufferers and the orphan locally. Okhaldhunga has the most faithful temples; Shree Champadevi temple in Bilandu -9, Kotika Kalika Devi temple in Chisankhu, Jageshwar Mahadev temple in Salleri Laglage, Pokhara devi temple in Tin Kanya Devi temple Pokhara-1, Namaideshwor Mahadev temple in Singhadevi Temple, Kuibhir -5, Mahadev temple of Thulibanshi in Bunnam and Kuntadevi temple of Khudampa in Diyale, Samanawati devi temple in Barnalu-9, Raghuwireshowr Mahadev temple in Okhaldhunga bazaar, and Kalikadevi in Saraswati sthan, Jalpadevi in Bhimsensthan, Watuk bhairab Ganesh temple. Involvement of local government bodies and local people of Okhaldhunga in spreading the information of these temple to people is seem to be important. Social and cultural institution should also play leadership role in the process. Gumba - 15% of Buddhist are in Okhaldhunga and we have eight popular gumba which are also not well informed to the public. Some popular gumba of the district are Tolthol gumba, Riyal gumba and Dolakhark gumba of Patle, Kimardin gumba of Bhusinga, Ketuke gumba of Ketuke, Bhirkhark gumba of Khiji, Ghunsa gumba of Baruneshwor and Lamja gumba of Ragani. These gumba attracts both national and foreign tourists, and nuns and monks. We need to do some fine-grained research studies on gumba of Manang, Mustang and Rasuwa. In reality it is not practical for Okhaldhunga if you stay in a room like you would if you were to make a development strategy for national planning in Kathmandu. The reason behind this is only the local public of Okhaldhunga knows the <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> and they have love and affection for Okhaldhunga. These local public of Okhaldhunga live their life and send the last minute of their life in Okhaldhunga due to which they should be devoted in development of the district and spreading the information to help growth of the tourism. We should be free from our misunderstanding of the Government employees, {{they are not going to}} benefit Okhaldhunga nor are they going to view Okhaldhunga with a sacred vision. Things to do to make Okhaldhunga a tourism sector: People living outside the district needs to spread the information of Okhaldhunga. Integrate the religious and racial unity in the district. Coordinate the plans and programs of Okhaldhunga to the Non-government organizations. A feeling of “Village development is development of your own home” should be developed. If we could adopt these above mentioned points, it will not take long for us to reach to our goals and objectives Khijee Chandashwori Majh Gaun ward No.2 ED.By Mr.Durga Sunuwar (copy) ...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to find out the socio-demographic, epidemiological and environmental determinants of this outbreak. Methods: A case-control study was conducted in Rajpara village among 238 cases of acute gastroenteritis and an equal number of controls in January 2015. Multiple logistic regression was used for identifying the variables independently predicting acute gastroenteritis. Results: Upper socio-economic status, occupation requiring travel outside village, source of drinking water from well of ‘new’ Rajpara village, change in <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> use of chlorine tablets, travel outside village in last week, another family member affected with acute gastroenteritis, using common utensil for hand washing, hand washing before eating, ate food from outside in last week, having sanitary latrine at house, waste disposal in a common dump (instead of at house), waste accumulation around house and flies inside house were significantly associated with occurrence of acute gastroenteritis. On multiple logistic regression, change in <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> (P< 0. 001), waste disposal in a common dump (P= 0. 012), another family member been affected (P< 0. 001), waste accumulation around house (P< 0. 001), higher socio-economic status (P= 0. 002) and eating outside food (P= 0. 011) made a significant contribution to prediction. Conclusions: Socio-demographic factors (higher socio-economic status), epidemiological correlates (change in <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> another family member been affected with acute gastroenteritis and eating outside food) and environmental determinants (waste disposal in a common dump and waste accumulation around house) significantly determines the occurrence of cases of acute gastroenteritis.

This study suggests a new approach to qualify and quantify <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> using multiple physiological measurements to go back up the perception chain. The four basic tastes (sweet, salty, acid and bitter) were used and diluted in Evian water as a standard, at low concentrations. Autonomic system responses were measured with skin blood flow variations. Results from skin blood flow variations are presented and indicate a high correlation between the duration and amplitude of the response with the self-reported intensity and pleasantness of the stimulus. It also shows that physiological measurements enable the significant discrimination of the different tastes even at detection threshold concentrations. The prediction of the characteristics of a stimulus might be obtained by combining multiple physiological data and sensory response...|$|E

40|$|The role of sulfate and nitrate in {{the taste}} of {{drinking}} water is not entirely clear. Taste threshold concentrations (TTCs) were estimated for these two species by the 3 -AFC method by a trained panel, as sodium and calcium salts. In both cases TTCs for nitrate were about 100 mg NO 3 /L, twice the usual reference value of international recommendations. TTCs for sulfate were about 160 mg SO 4 /L (sodium salt) and 80 mg SO 4 /L (calcium); 75 % detection values were also estimated for both anions. An experiment {{with a series of}} duo-trio tests plus preference showed that sulfate at low concentrations tended to improve the <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> However, at high concentrations it was perceived negatively: salty and bitter were the main descriptors used. The reversion concentration took place between 176 and 259 mg SO 4 /L. These results indicate that nitrate has to be considered an important issue for health, but with no relevant role in the <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> Sulfate shows a positive influence at moderate concentrations but becomes negative at high levels.

30|$|The {{electrical}} conductivity (EC) greatly affects the <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> It is an indirect measure of total dissolved salts {{available in the}} water. Electrical conductivity ranged from 162 to 167.5  µS/cm in the water of Satopanth Lake. However, a high {{electrical conductivity}} (530  µS/cm) was recorded in the surface water of glacial lake Ximencuo (Pu et al. 2013). Low electrical conductivity is a characteristic of good quality of water. Electrical conductivity depends upon the quantity of dissolved salts present in water. The mean value is below the range of 250  µS/cm− 1 as per WHO standards. Similar results were recorded by Chacon-Torres and Rosas-Monge (1998) for high altitude Mexican lake; Saini et al.
