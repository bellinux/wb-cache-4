Australia thus went <b>to</b> <b>lunch</b> at 4/204, with Harvey on 70.|$|E
5|$|Catherine Hicks plays Doctor Gillian Taylor, a {{biologist}} on 20th century Earth. During production a rumor circulated that the part {{had been created}} after Shatner demanded a love interest, a regular aspect of the television series that was absent from the first three films. Writer Nicholas Meyer denied this, saying that the inspiration for Taylor came from a woman biologist featured in a National Geographic documentary about whales. Nimoy chose Hicks after inviting her <b>to</b> <b>lunch</b> with Shatner and witnessing a chemistry between the two. The role was originally written for Eddie Murphy as an astrophysicist at Berkeley.|$|E

Until Ford's death, Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, visited the Fords' home frequently. Ford and Carter served as honorary co-chairs of the National Commission on Federal Election Reform in 2001 and of the Continuity of Government Commission in 2002.|$|E

Whitlam, who was determined to destroy both Fraser's leadership and the Senate's right to block supply, refused any compromise.|$|E

5|$|A C Benson was {{a friend}} of Henry James, to whom Walpole wrote a fan letter late in 1908, with Benson's encouragement. A {{correspondence}} ensued and in February 1909 James invited Walpole <b>to</b> <b>lunch</b> at the Reform Club in London. They developed a close friendship, described by James's biographer Leon Edel as resembling a father and son relationship in some, but not all, respects. James was greatly taken with the young Walpole, though clear-eyed about the deficiencies in the artistry and craftsmanship of his protégé's early efforts. According to Somerset Maugham, Walpole made a sexual proposition to James, who was too inhibited to respond. Nevertheless, in their correspondence the older man's devotion was couched in extravagant terms.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Hitler {{had come}} into power, he had started to make plans to rebuild the chancellery. At the end of 1933 he {{contracted}} Paul Troost to renovate the entire building. Hitler appointed Speer, whose work for Goebbels had impressed him, to manage the building site for Troost. As Chancellor, Hitler had a residence in the building and came by every day to be briefed by Speer and the building supervisor {{on the progress of}} the renovations. After one of these briefings, Hitler invited Speer <b>to</b> <b>lunch,</b> to the architect's great excitement. Hitler evinced considerable interest in Speer during the luncheon, and later told Speer that he had been looking for a young architect capable of carrying out his architectural dreams for the new Germany. Speer quickly became part of Hitler's inner circle; he was expected to call on Hitler in the morning for a walk or chat, to provide consultation on architectural matters, and to discuss Hitler's ideas. Most days he was invited to dinner.|$|E

5|$|Two former {{restaurants}} operated at the campus: the Conservatory Restaurant was led {{by students}} of the Farm-to-Table concentration in the CIA's bachelor's degree programs. The Wine Spectator Greystone Restaurant (WSGR) was run by students in the associate degree program in culinary arts. The restaurant focused on using local and seasonal ingredients, and the dining room had open cooking stations to give diners a {{full view of the}} working kitchen. The WSGR initially served food of the Mediterranean cuisines, and was at first professionally run. Later on, it became fully student-run, however changes in late 2015 led <b>to</b> <b>lunch</b> service staffed by students and dinner service staffed by employees. The restaurants closed around 2016 with the campus' reorganization after purchasing Copia.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) {{leaves his}} trailer for work, as he {{approaches}} a bear growling outside. He wants {{to move back to}} Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo)'s house, but Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) insists that they must go forward in life. Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) brings her father, Thatcher Grey (Jeff Perry), who is vomiting blood, into the emergency room, and Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) treats him. Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) admits an elderly patient, Irving Waller (Ralph Waite), with skin growths, who later reveals that he wants a penile prosthesis, to which he receives. It is revealed that Thatcher needs a liver transplantation, and Stevens is assigned to a cancerous patient, Randy (Jocko Sims), by Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd). Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) wants to ask the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) for a job as an attending surgeon, but is nervous that he will reject her, and goes out <b>to</b> <b>lunch</b> with her girlfriend Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw).|$|E
5|$|In a {{symbolic}} act, the first rivet placed into the skin, fixing a copper plate onto the statue's big toe, {{was driven by}} United States Ambassador to France Levi P. Morton. The skin was not, however, crafted in exact sequence from low to high; work proceeded {{on a number of}} segments simultaneously in a manner often confusing to visitors. Some work was performed by contractors—one of the fingers was made to Bartholdi's exacting specifications by a coppersmith in the southern French town of Montauban. By 1882, the statue was complete up to the waist, an event Barthodi celebrated by inviting reporters <b>to</b> <b>lunch</b> on a platform built within the statue. Laboulaye died in 1883. He was succeeded as chairman of the French committee by Ferdinand de Lesseps, builder of the Suez Canal. The completed statue was formally presented to Ambassador Morton at a ceremony in Paris on July 4, 1884, and de Lesseps announced that the French government had agreed to pay for its transport to New York. The statue remained intact in Paris pending sufficient progress on the pedestal; by January 1885, this had occurred and the statue was disassembled and crated for its ocean voyage.|$|E

Stanley and Phyllis respond with their usual disinterest in helping others, so Jim offers to treat them <b>to</b> <b>lunch.</b> Stanley and Phyllis order extra side dishes and help themselves to an excess of wine, annoying Jim with drunken behavior and silencing him whenever he brings up the subject of their covering for him. When they arrive back at the office, a drunk Stanley and Phyllis are seemingly passed out in the backseat of Jim's car. When Jim puts his coat on them to keep them warm, Phyllis and Stanley say they will cover for him as they care for Jim and his family, laughing as they reveal they were only pranking him.

5|$|The Doctor lands the TARDIS in Cardiff, {{using the}} energy of the Cardiff Rift to {{recharge}} the engines. Rose has Mickey bring her passport to the TARDIS, and together with the Doctor and Jack Harkness, they go <b>to</b> <b>lunch.</b> At lunch, the Doctor spots a newspaper article showing Margaret Blaine, a Slitheen, has become Cardiff's new mayor. The four track down and capture Margaret to find out what she is doing there after their previous encounter (in Aliens of London). The Doctor observes Blaine's scale model plans for a new nuclear power plant, but identifies that it is purposely flawed to cause a meltdown that would open the Cardiff Rift and destroy the Earth. He also discovers the model contains a functioning tribophysical waveform macro-kinetic extrapolator that Margaret would have used to flee the Earth. The Doctor decides to take Margaret back to her home planet of Raxacoricofallapatorious, but she reveals that she has received a death sentence there and will be executed upon returning. The Doctor agrees to her final request to accompany her to a dinner meal. Margaret makes several half-hearted attempts to kill the Doctor but he easily avoids them. She then tries to play on the Doctor's sympathies, asking him to take her to another planet instead.|$|E
