25|$|The first {{success in}} this Anglo-Italian {{cooperation}} came in December 1910. In that month, the British Warsangali and the Italian Mijertain peacefully resolved all their outstanding disputes and, convening in Bander Kasim, agreed <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>jointly</b> in combating Sayyid Mohammed Abdullah Hassan and his Dervishes. The Mijertain–Warsangali Accord led to a common offensive against the Mullah, whose forces were cut off from arms and munitions smuggled in from the coast. (Hess, 427) In 1920, the Dervishes unexpectedly captured Badhan and besieged Las Khorey. The British Governor at Aden soon sent RAF biplanes to contain the advance of the Dervish army into the Warsangali country. Though the air strikes that bombarded Badhan, Jidali and Talex never did considerable harm to the Dervishes, the Dervishes were still powerful but disorganized and dispersed into unknown areas. Finally, the forces of Warsangali and Dervishes met at Jidali and this {{was in fact the}} final decimation of the Dervish movement.|$|E

50|$|For {{the next}} few years, Wang was largely {{in control of the}} government, but Yu Liang, who had then exiled himself from the capital as the {{governor}} of Jing Province (荊州, modern Hubei and Hunan), continued to be influential despite his distance from the capital. In 338, Yu, unhappy that, in his view, Wang was not adequately preparing Emperor Cheng to rule, tried to persuade Chi Jian <b>to</b> <b>jointly</b> <b>act</b> with him <b>to</b> depose Wang, but Chi refused. Wang stayed regent until his death in 339, and he was buried with great honors, including some ceremonies that were ordinarily reserved for emperors. He was succeeded by his assistant He Chong (何充) and Yu Liang's younger brother Yu Bing (庾冰).|$|R

60|$|Experience of the {{difficulties}} attending the determination of our admitted line of boundary, after the occupation of the territory and its settlement by those owing allegiance to the respective Governments, points {{to the importance of}} establishing, by natural objects or other monuments, the actual line between the territory acquired by purchase from Russia and the adjoining possessions of Her Britannic Majesty. The region is now so sparsely occupied that no conflicting interests of individuals or of jurisdiction are likely to interfere to the delay or embarrassment of the actual location of the line. If deferred until population shall enter and occupy the territory, some trivial contest of neighbors may again array the two Governments in antagonism. I therefore recommend the appointment of a commission, <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>jointly</b> with one that may be appointed on the part of Great Britain, to determine the line between our Territory of Alaska and the conterminous possessions of Great Britain.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{understand}} {{the perception of}} women that will undergo the preventive examination of uterine cervical cancer. Methods: It was an exploratory-descriptive study. The sample was comprised by 25 women in the age group from 18 to 59 years, users of the Mother-Child Health Center in Barbalha-CE-Brazil. Data collection happened between May and June 2009 using semi-structured interviews with the following guiding questions: What {{do you know about}} the purpose of the preventive examination of uterine cervical cancer? What made you seek the health unit to perform this examination? What do you feel when you undergo the examination? Data were analyzed based on the subjects’ speeches categorization, and later discussed according to the literature concerning the subject. Results: The investigation showed that the subjects {{understand the}} preventive examination with a healing perspective, since most seek the service facing some symptoms; shame and fear are the main expressed feelings concerning the examination. These factors can contribute to the non adherence to Pap test. Conclusion: The women interviewed showed to have superficial and often wrong knowledge on the examination of cervical cancer. This reveals the need for re-orientation of health services focusing on health promotion, providing the users knowledge and awareness <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as <b>jointly</b> responsible for their health, by adhering to the examination and probably reducing the number of cases of uterine cervical cancer...|$|R

40|$|Metapopulation {{persistence}} in fragmented landscapes depends on habitat patches that can support resilient local populations and sufficient connectivity between patches. Yet epidemiological theory for metapopulations has largely overlooked {{the capacity of}} particular patches <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as refuges from disease, and has suggested that connectivity can undermine persistence. Here, we show that relatively warm and saline wetlands are environmental refuges from chytridiomycosis for an endangered Australian frog, and <b>act</b> <b>jointly</b> with connectivity <b>to</b> sustain frog metapopulations. We coupled models of microclimate and infection probability to map chytrid prevalence, and demonstrate a strong negative relationship between chytrid prevalence and the persistence of frog populations. Simulations confirm that frog metapopulations are likely to go extinct when they lack environmental refuges from disease and lose connectivity between patches. This study demonstrates that environmental heterogeneity can mediate host-pathogen interactions in fragmented landscapes, and provides evidence that connectivity principally supports host metapopulations afflicted by facultative pathogens...|$|R

40|$|The {{critical}} role of early interactions with significant adults {{on the psychological}} development of the infant and young child is wide recognised. Good quality in child care has, as a central feature, emphasis {{on the nature of}} interactions between infants and caregivers. This paper will explore one type of interaction - the joint-attention interaction - in which adult, or more competent peer, and infant share attention <b>to</b> and/or <b>jointly</b> <b>act</b> upon some object or event. These interactions are considered key building blocks of later cognitive and cultural competence. Preliminary data will be presented from two studies examining interactions and infants in child care. The first study raises questions about the frequency and quality of joint attentional sequences in child care centres and examines factors that may limit the ability of staff to interact with infants. These factors have implications for training, policy and practice. The second study looks at an infant's everyday experiences and reflects on how more knowledge of these experiences could lead to better quality infant child care programs...|$|R
