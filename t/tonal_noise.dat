40|$|This paper {{presents}} the work aiming for <b>tonal</b> <b>noise</b> reduction in a centrifugal fan. In previous studies, {{it is well}} documented that <b>tonal</b> <b>noise</b> is the dominant noise source generated in centrifugal fans. <b>Tonal</b> <b>noise</b> is generated due to the aerodynamic interaction between the rotating impeller and stationary diffuser vanes. The generation of <b>tonal</b> <b>noise</b> {{is related to the}} pressure fluctuation at {{the leading edge of the}} stationary vane. The <b>tonal</b> <b>noise</b> is periodic in time which occurs at the blade passing frequency (BPF) and its harmonics. Much of previous studies, have shown that the stationary vane causes the <b>tonal</b> <b>noise</b> and generation of non-rotational turbulent noise. However, omitting stationary vanes will lead to the increase of non-rotational turbulent noise resulted from the high velocity of the flow leaving the impeller. Hence in order to reduce the <b>tonal</b> <b>noise</b> and the non-rotational noise, guide vanes were designed as part of this study to replace the diffuser vanes, which were originally used in the chosen centrifugal fan. The leading edge of the guide vane is tapered. This modification reduces the strength of pressure fluctuation resulting from the interaction between the impeller outflow and stationary vane. The sound pressure level at blade passing frequency (BPF) is reduced by 6. 8 dB, the 2 nd BPF is reduced by 4. 1 dB and the 3 rd BPF reduced by about 17. 5 dB. The overall reduction was 0. 9 dB. The centrifugal fan with tapered guide vanes radiates lower <b>tonal</b> <b>noise</b> compared to the existing diffuser vanes. These reductions are achieved without compromising the performance of the centrifugal fan. The behavior of the fluid flow was studied using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools and the acoustics characteristics were determined through experiments in an anechoic chamber...|$|E

Almost all automotive and industrial diesel engines and most of the high performance SI engines are equipped with turbocharger. Even though past few decades have seen continuous performance improvement, there is still lack of wide range research on acoustical behavior of turbochargers. A turbocharger consists of compressor which is driven by an exhaust turbine. Turbocharger produces high frequency aerodynamic sound due to the high speed rotating blade.

40|$|In this study, {{efficient}} numerical {{method is}} proposed for predicting <b>tonal</b> and broadband <b>noises</b> of a centrifugal fan unit. The proposed method {{is based on}} Hybrid Computational Aero-Acoustic (H-CAA) techniques combined with Unsteady Fast Random Particle Mesh (U-FRPM) method. The U-FRPM method is developed by extending the FRPM method proposed by Ewert et al. and is utilized to synthesize turbulence flow field from unsteady RANS solutions. The H-CAA technique combined with U-FRPM method is applied to predict broadband as well as <b>tonal</b> <b>noises</b> of a centrifugal fan unit in a household refrigerator. Firstly, unsteady flow field driven by a rotating fan is computed by solving the RANS equations with Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) techniques. Main source regions around the rotating fan are identified by examining the computed flow fields. Then, turbulence flow fields in the main source regions are synthesized by applying the U-FRPM method. The acoustic analogy is applied to model acoustic sources in the main source regions. Finally, the centrifugal fan noise is predicted by feeding the modeled acoustic sources into an acoustic solver based on the Boundary Element Method (BEM). The sound spectral levels predicted using the current numerical method show good agreements with the measured spectra at the Blade Pass Frequencies (BPFs) {{as well as in}} the high frequency range.

Sixteen different industrial stimuli were created combining cooling tower noise, transformer noise and another industrial source noise, mixed with two kind of background noise (“traffic road” and “nature”). With a computer tool, twenty-two people were able to change the composition of the industrial sound (without changing the overall SPL of 40 dB(A)) and design a better sound target by improving sound quality. The first result of this study is that the average optimized stimulus is composed with more of cooling tower noise and less transformer noise. This average stimulus is “a little more pleasant” than the original sound (on a continuous scale from “much more unpleasant” to “much more pleasant”). This increase in pleasantness (with constant overall level) has been translated into an equivalent reduction of about 2. 5 dB(A) of the original sound...|$|R
40|$|Building {{mechanical}} equipment often generates prominent tones because most systems include rotating parts like fans and pumps. These <b>tonal</b> <b>noises</b> can cause unpleasant user experiences in spaces and, in turn, {{lead to increased}} complaints by building occupants. Currently, architectural engineers can apply the noise criteria guidelines in standards or publications to achieve acceptable noise conditions for assorted types of spaces. However, these criteria do not apply well if the noise contains perceptible tones. The annoyance thresholds experienced by the general population {{with regards to the}} degree of tones in noise is a significant piece of knowledge that has not been well-established. Thus, this dissertation addresses the relationship between human perception and noises with tones in the built environment. ^ Four phases of subjective testing were conducted in an indoor acoustic testing chamber at the University of Nebraska to achieve the research objective. The results indicate that even the least prominent tones in noises can significantly decrease the cognitive performance of participants on a mentally demanding task. Factorial repeated-measures analysis of variance of test results have proven that tonality has a crucial influence on working memory capacity of subjects, whereas loudness levels alone did not. A multidimensional annoyance model, incorporating psycho-acoustical attributes of noise in addition to loudness and tonality, has been proposed as a more accurate annoyance model. ...|$|R
