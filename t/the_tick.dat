5|$|In the Ixodidae, <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> {{stays in}} place until it is {{completely}} engorged. Its weight may increase by 200 to 600 times as compared to its weight before it started feeding. To accommodate this large expansion, cell division takes place and its cuticle grows larger; <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> may remain attached for days or weeks, depending on species, life stage and host. In the Argasidae, the tick's cuticle stretches to accommodate the fluid ingested but does not grow new cells, the weight of <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> increasing five to tenfold over the unfed state. <b>The</b> <b>tick</b> then drops off the host and typically remains in the nest or burrow until its host returns to provide its next meal.|$|E

5|$|Although {{reproduction}} occurs {{around the}} year, {{there is a}} peak during the summer (November to April). Molting mostly occurs during autumn and winter (April to August). At one locality in Mendoza, Akodon spegazzinii occurs at an estimated density of 21 individuals per hectare (8.5 per acre) and has a home range size of about 300 m2 (3200sqft). A number of sigmodontines have been recorded as occurring with A.spegazzinii, including A.caenosus, A.simulator, Neotomys ebriosus, Abrothrix illuteus, Reithrodon auritus, Andinomys edax, and various species of Eligmodontia, Necromys, Calomys, Oligoryzomys, Oxymycterus, and Phyllotis. <b>The</b> <b>tick</b> Ixodes sigelos has been recorded on A.spegazzinii in Tucumán. In addition, the mites Androlaelaps fahrenholzi, Androlaelaps rotundus, and Eulaelaps stabularis and the flea Cleopsylla townsendii are known from the species.|$|E

5|$|Common ixodid ticks {{collected}} from impala include Amblyomma hebraeum, Boophilus decoloratus, Hyalomma marginatum, Ixodes cavipalpus, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus and R. evertsi. In Zimbabwe, heavy infestation by ticks such as R. appendiculatus {{has proved to}} be a major cause behind the high mortality of ungulates, as they can lead to tick paralysis. Impala have special adaptations for grooming, such as their characteristic dental arrangement, to manage ticks before they engorge; however, the extensive grooming needed to keep <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> load under control involves the risk of dehydration during summer, lower vigilance against predators and gradual wearing out of the teeth. A study showed that impala adjust the time devoted to grooming and the number of grooming bouts according to the seasonal prevalence of ticks.|$|E

In Hungary, some jackals carry dog heartworm Dirofilaria immitis, and some have provided the first record in Hungary of Trichinella spiralis and the first record in Europe of Echinococcus multilocularis. The jackal is dispersing across Europe through rivers and valleys, bringing parasites into regions where these did not previously exist.|$|E
5|$|Myotis alcathoe is a {{rare species}} with narrow {{ecological}} requirements. According to {{a study in the}} Czech Republic, the diet of Myotis alcathoe mostly consists of nematoceran flies, but caddisflies, spiders, small lepidopterans, and neuropterans are also taken. The presence of spiders in the diet suggests that the species gleans prey from foliage. It forages mainly high in the canopy and over water, and is often found in dense vegetation. The parasitic mite Spinturnix mystacina has been found on M.alcathoe, and the mites on M.alcathoe, M.brandtii, and M.mystacinus are genetically closely related. The bat fly Basilia mongolensis nudior has been recorded on M.alcathoe in Thuringia and <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> Ixodes vespertilionis in Romania.

5|$|Not all ticks in an infective {{area are}} {{infected}} with pathogens, and both attachment of <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> and a long-feeding session seem to be necessary for transmission of these diseases to take place. Thus tick bites often do not lead to infection, especially if the ticks are removed within 36 hours. Adult ticks can be removed with fine-tipped tweezers or proprietary tick removal tools, disinfecting the wound. It is also possible to freeze them off with a medical wart remover. If the tick's head and mouthparts break off during removal, they can be removed with tweezers like a splinter.|$|E
5|$|Some ticks attach quickly {{while others}} wander {{around looking for}} thinner skin such as is found on the ears of mammals. Depending on the species and the life stage, {{preparing}} to feed can take from ten minutes to two hours. On locating a suitable feeding spot, <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> grasps the host's skin and cuts into the surface. They extract blood by cutting {{a hole in the}} host's epidermis, into which they insert their hypostome, and keep the blood from clotting by excreting an anticoagulant or platelet aggregation inhibitor.|$|E
5|$|Ticks are {{implicated in}} the {{transmission}} {{of a number of}} infections caused by pathogens such as bacteria, viruses and protozoa. Sometimes <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> harbours more than one type of pathogen, making diagnosis of the infection more difficult. Species of the bacterium Rickettsia are responsible for typhus, rickettsialpox, Boutonneuse fever, African tick bite fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Flinders Island spotted fever and Queensland tick typhus (Australian tick typhus). Other tick-borne diseases include Lyme disease and Q fever, Colorado tick fever, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, tularemia, tick-borne relapsing fever, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, Bourbon virus and tick-borne meningoencephalitis, as well as bovine anaplasmosis and probably the Heartland virus.|$|E
40|$|Borrelia spirochetes in bird-feeding ticks {{were studied}} in the Czech Republic. During the postbreeding period (July to September 2005), 1, 080 {{passerine}} birds infested by 2, 240 Ixodes ricinus subadult ticks were examined. Borrelia garinii was detected in 22. 2 % of <b>the</b> <b>ticks,</b> Borrelia valaisiana was detected in 12. 8 % of <b>the</b> <b>ticks,</b> Borrelia afzelii was detected in 1. 6 % of <b>the</b> <b>ticks,</b> and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto was detected in 0. 3 % of <b>the</b> <b>ticks.</b> After analysis of infections in which the blood meal volume and the stage of <b>the</b> <b>ticks</b> were considered, we concluded that Eurasian blackbirds (Turdus merula), song thrushes (Turdus philomelos), and great tits (Parus major) are capable of transmitting B. garinii; that juvenile blackbirds and song thrushes are prominent reservoirs for B. garinii spirochetes; that some other passerine birds investigated play minor roles in transmitting B. garinii; and that the presence B. afzelii in ticks results from infection in a former stage. Thus, while B. garinii transmission is associated {{with only a few}} passerine bird species, these birds have the potential to distribute millions of Lyme disease spirochetes between urban areas...|$|R

5|$|Wolves {{are often}} infested {{with a variety}} of {{arthropod}} exoparasites, including fleas, ticks, lice, and mites. The most harmful to wolves, particularly pups, is Sarcoptes scabiei (or mange mite), though they rarely develop full blown mange, unlike foxes. Lice, such as Trichodectes canis, may cause sickness in wolves, but rarely death. Ticks of the genus Ixodes can infect wolves with Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. <b>The</b> <b>tick</b> Dermacentor pictus also infests wolves. Other ectoparasites include biting lice, sucking lice and the fleas Pulex irritans and Ctenocephalides canis.|$|E
25|$|The tick's {{salivary glands}} and gut {{contents}} are together {{the main source}} of the noxious substances and these are located in the main body of <b>the</b> <b>tick.</b> It is thought that any irritation of <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> might cause it to either inject saliva or regurgitate gut contents or that any compression the body of <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> might squeeze saliva and gut contents into the host.|$|E
25|$|Attached ticks {{should be}} removed promptly, as removal within 36 hours can reduce {{transmission}} rates. Folk remedies for tick removal tend to be ineffective, offer no advantages in preventing the transfer of disease, and may increase the risks of transmission or infection. The best method is simply to pull <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> out with tweezers {{as close to the}} skin as possible, without twisting, and avoiding crushing the body of <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> or removing the head from the tick's body. The risk of infection increases with the time <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> is attached, and if a tick is attached for less than 24 hours, infection is unlikely. However, since these ticks are very small, especially in the nymph stage, prompt detection is quite difficult. The Australian Society of Clinical Immunology recommends against using tweezers to remove ticks but rather to kill <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> first by using a product to rapidly freeze <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> to prevent it from injecting more allergen-containing saliva. In a tick allergic person, <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> should be killed and removed in a safe place (e.g. an emergency department of a hospital).|$|E
