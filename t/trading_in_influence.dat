The tourist flows studied are inbound tourism to New Zealand from Australia, Japan, the UK and USA.

While {{at the beginning of the}} discussion measures were focused relatively narrowly on specific crimes, above all bribery, the understanding of corruption has become broader and so have the measures against it. UNCAC's comprehensive approach and the mandatory character of many of its provisions give proof of this development. UNCAC deals with forms of corruption that had not been covered by many of the earlier international instruments, such as <b>trading</b> <b>in</b> <b>influence,</b> abuse of function, and various types of corruption in the private sector. A further significant development was the inclusion of a specific chapter dealing with the recovery of stolen assets, a major concern for countries that pursue the assets of former leaders and other officials accused or found to have engaged in corruption.|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} paradox {{in western}} societies has emerged: cases concerning <b>trading</b> <b>in</b> <b>influence</b> {{become more and more}} imminent and with it the necessity to deal effectively with this phenomenon. International conventions call for the criminalization of this form of corruption but many States are hesitant to establish this form of corruption as a criminal offence under their domestic law. Recent scandals such as the Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, promising access to her ex-husband Prince Andrew, who serves as a quasi-official trade envoy for Great Britain, to ‘rich businessmen' {{is just one of the}} more obvious cases in which a person promises to exert an improper influence over the decision-making process of a public official in return for an undue advantage. Current allegations of the illegal financing of Sarkozy's 2007 election campaign by L'Oreal's heiress Bettencourt and the influencing by the others involved in this case, are exemplary of the value of ‘having access to the decision maker'. <b>Trading</b> <b>in</b> <b>influence,</b> or influence peddling, is not something new in the debate on corruption. It found its way in the Council of Europe's Criminal Convention on Corruption (hereinafter ‘COE Convention') as early as 1999. The principal aim of the Convention is to develop common standards concerning certain corrupt offences, although it does not prescribe a uniform definition of corruption. By harmonising the definitions for specific corrupt offences, it aims at meeting the requirement of dual criminality. The COE Convention has been ratified by 43 States, over one fourth of these States have made a reservation against the undertaking to introduce criminal provisions for <b>trading</b> <b>in</b> <b>influence.</b> Among these are the United Kingdom, Denmark and the Netherlands. Nevertheless, allegations of <b>trading</b> <b>in</b> <b>influence</b> and unjustified influencing are omnipresent in media coverage. From the latest COE Convention Evaluation and Compliance reports, it becomes clear that many of the ratifying States face difficulties in providing adequate legal instruments in their anti-corruption policies to deal with <b>trading</b> <b>in</b> <b>influence.</b> The more surprising it is that the Council of Europe and its Member States were not actively discussing this topic in order to reach a common ground for a provision on <b>trading</b> <b>in</b> <b>influence.</b> Why does the Council of Europe persistently continue to stress the importance of criminalizing <b>trading</b> <b>in</b> <b>influence</b> while some of its Member States are determined in their refusal to criminalize <b>trading</b> <b>in</b> <b>influence</b> without seeking for further dialogue? Few analyses were to be found on this paradox although the topicality of this pressing matter is evident.

30|$|Third, {{complementarity}} to pastoral {{livestock production}} appears to significantly influence household choice regarding whether {{to participate in}} non-livestock income activities. The result of this study reveals that the diversification of incomes complementary to pastoral livestock production in pastoral settlements is occurring on two fronts: (1) diversification {{in the form of}} <b>trading</b> <b>in</b> livestock (<b>influenced</b> by the development of markets for humanitarian de-stocking programmes) and (2) diversification in the form of <b>trading</b> <b>in</b> livestock products to respond to opportunities arising from expanding urban environments and market centres. Under this system, diversification into “easy income” non-livestock activities is not only supported through livestock assets but also pursued to enhance complementarities with livestock production. This finding may imply that income diversification - as opposed to exiting out of the pastoral livelihood - is attractive and that those engaged in it are mainly incentivized by opportunities within the livestock economy itself, which is enhanced by the growing populations in pastoral settlements. In this case, one may argue that income diversification in pastoral settlements is practiced more as a risk management strategy than a wealth accumulation strategy.|$|R

40|$|The impropriety {{principle}} {{is a central}} legal standard that should {{be determined by the}} courts in light of the prevailing ethical and moral perceptions in the society. To decide whether an advantage is undue, the preparatory work mentions some factors that {{should be part of the}} assessment: the economic value of the advantage, the giver and receiver’s positions and their relationship, whether there is a public official involved, the purpose of the advantage, whether there has been transparency, whether internal guidelines or business practices have been breached, and finally the fundamental value behind the clause. The deed would also have to be clearly blameworthy 1. It seems as though the element that is emphasized by the court is whether the active briber intends to influence the passive briber. If an advantage is meant to influence the receiver it would naturally be perceived as an undue advantage. This is illustrated in the verdict where a man tried to bribe two police officers with 500 kroner, and was convicted of corruption 2. The same is illustrated in the Ruter verdict 3, where the operations manager was acquitted among other because he could prove that the dinners were not treated to influence him. A similar argument is found in the Unibuss case 4, where a defendant received “undue advantages”, but was not a decision-maker and consequently could not reciprocate. Since the changes in the Penal Code in 2003 corruption in the private and the public sector has been punishable by the same clause, § 276 a (continued as § 387 in the 2005 Penal Code), but there is still a practical difference to the two. As illustrated in verdicts such as the Ruter verdict, Unibuss and the Ullevål case 5 situations involving public means or people representing public companies are subject to stricter moral standards and regulations. This means that not only public officials directly, but also people with similar positions of power and people managing public means, can be subject to the same standards as public officials. <b>Trading</b> <b>in</b> <b>influence</b> and corruption are two quite similar offenses, yet the maximum penalty for <b>trading</b> <b>in</b> <b>influence</b> is 3 years imprisonment, while gross corruption can be penalized by 10 years imprisonment. The difference between the two is therefore important to notice. The offence is described similarly in the legislation; however <b>trading</b> <b>in</b> <b>influence</b> involves a third party that might not even know that he is involved. Sordid corruption is when you bribe someone to influence them, while when guilty of <b>trading</b> <b>in</b> <b>influence,</b> you bribe someone to influence an external third party. In the Yara verdict the court stated that a situation cannot necessarily be characterized as <b>trading</b> <b>in</b> <b>influence</b> when the advantage is not paid directly to the decision maker. Corruption also includes indirect advantages, cf. the wording “for himself or others” in the Penal Code § 276 a (§ 387 in 2005 code) 6. The real difference between <b>trading</b> <b>in</b> <b>influence</b> and sordid corruption is not in the assessment of the impropriety principle, but rather which group of people it applies to. The Taxation Act forbids deduction for both representation and bribes, and therefore there is no clear distinction between the two 7. We find that the lack of a clear boundary might not be problematic according to the Taxation Act, however it constitutes a problem when businesses are trying to avoid the “grey area” according to the Penal Code. Customer relationship management can be crucial for many businesses, and better guidelines on the matter may prevent many of the minor cases of corruption. This view is supported by NHO 8. Facilitation payments have not been mentioned much in the preparatory work to the Penal Code, and according to the OECD convention the members are only obliged to incriminate facilitation payments by or towards foreign public officials. In the preparatory work the Department has stated that facilitation payments are to be considered as corruption as long as the advantage given in “undue”. That is, the legal standard in § 387 applies. When deciding whether the advantage is undue, one should also consider whether the situation can be categorized as black mail. In that case legal action should be made with caution 9. Based on our findings, we have made a practical guide on where the line is drawn relating to different scenarios in chapter 12 in this paper. It is important to note that this is just an indication based on preparatory work, jurisprudence and other legal theory, and that it is only the court that can decide whether an advantage is undue or not...|$|E
