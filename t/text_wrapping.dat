But, as against Marulić (in whom man lives in the permanent environment of death, life being transitory and human-kind having to take constant account of the end) in later Croatian poets this relation-ship is altered. What earlier filled the poet and reader with fear becomes a source of ebullience. Marulić’s writing is a copy of human life, an explanation of it, its being given sense even in death. Poetry of the Marulić type, his description of things and events (there also being a desire to stress the meaning) is called the poetry of the core. Later poets in Croatia have given themselves over to refined sensibility of expression, more and more concerned for the decoration, the shell. Finally, works of art of both the earlier and the modern period are understand primarily as a unity of internal and external mimesis, of the core and the shell, content and form...|$|E

But today, there are numerous software programs that are capable of handling unlimited design styles, such color, <b>text</b> <b>wrapping,</b> rotation, and even graphic importation and exportation. Ami Pro is one of those software programs. Ami Pro is a powerful and 2 ̆ 2 user-friendly 2 ̆ 2 software program that was developed by the Lotus Development Corporation for MS DOS Windows. It is primarily used to serve the people in the professional work environment with clean and attractive office documents. Ami Pro has the designing capabilities of many of its software competitors, however, it is capable of something that it competition isn 2 ̆ 7 t; WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get). This means that whatever is seen on the computer screen is what is seen on the printed page. Ami Pro {{is also one of the}} few software programs that provides style sheets of various office documents. Style sheets are pre-defined styles or model templatess of several office documents. Style sheets relieve the user from performing repetitive fomatting steps necessary for creating multiple documents of the same type (e. g., memos). Encompassed within each style sheet are clues that visually identify and describe the various levels of each document 2 ̆ 7 s structure or makeup. Title, subhead, and body of text are a few examples of the different types of elements on a page in a document. These clues are also capable of identifying the many levels of type written office documents, given that each type-written document follows the general structure of a specific office document. The text formatting information (design information), integrated with the clues, is responsible for formatting the different levels of text by correcting improper spacing, punctuation, indention, etc. This information helps to make any Ami Pro office document look 2 ̆ 2 prettier. 2 ̆ 2 All together, style sheets, clues, and design information saves the user valuable time, as well as, improves the document 2 ̆ 7 s overall appearance and legibility.
