5|$|The {{first step}} was a precise {{characterization}} of the error in the main mirror. Working backwards from images of point sources, astronomers determined that the conic constant of <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> as built was , instead of the intended −1.00230. The same number was also derived by analyzing the null corrector used by Perkin-Elmer to figure <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> {{as well as by}} analyzing interferograms obtained during ground testing of <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{sharing a}} romantic {{dance with the}} Beast ("Beauty and the Beast"), Belle discovers her father's predicament using the magic mirror. The Beast {{releases}} her to save Maurice, giving her <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> to remember him with. Back at the village, Belle proves Maurice's sanity by revealing the Beast in <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> to the townsfolk. Realizing that Belle loves the Beast, Gaston has her thrown into the basement with her father and rallies the villagers to follow him to the castle to kill the Beast ("The Mob Song"). With Chip's aid, Maurice and Belle escape and rush back to the castle.|$|E

5|$|Autism is a {{disorder}} that {{is associated with}} social and communicative deficits. A single cause of autism has yet to be identified, but the mu wave and mirror neuron system have been studied specifically for their role in the disorder. In a typically developing individual, <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> neuron system responds when he or she either watches someone perform a task or performs the task him- or herself. In individuals with autism, mirror neurons become active (and consequently mu waves are suppressed) only when the individual performs the task him- or herself. This finding has led some scientists, notably V. S. Ramachandran and colleagues, to view autism as disordered understanding of other individuals' intentions and goals due to problems with <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> neuron system. This deficiency would explain the difficulty people with autism have in communicating with and understanding others. While most studies of <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> neuron system and mu waves in people with autism have focused on simple motor tasks, some scientists speculate that these tests can be expanded to show that problems with <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> neuron system underlie overarching cognitive and social deficits.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>mirroring</b> {{hypothesis}} – <b>the</b> assumed architectural mapping between firms’ strategic {{choices of}} product architecture and firm architecture, and between firms’ architectural choices and industry structures – has received mixed empirical support. The focus in thus shifting from ascertaining whether <b>the</b> <b>mirroring</b> hypothesis holds, {{to the product}} architecture and component-level conditions that may support <b>the</b> <b>mirroring</b> of architectures at different levels. We utilize an industrial economics perspective to develop a stylised product architecture typology and hypothesise how the combined effects of product architecture type, product complexity {{and the rate of}} product component change may be associated with phases of mirroring or misting (imperfect mirroring). Our framework helps to reconcile some of the existing mixed support for <b>the</b> <b>mirroring</b> hypothesis...|$|R

5|$|Adam, a photographer, awakens in {{a bathtub}} {{in a large}} {{dilapidated}} bathroom, and finds himself chained at the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence Gordon, an oncologist, is similarly shackled across the room, and between them is a corpse holding a revolver and a microcassette recorder. Each man has a tape in his pocket, and Adam is able to retrieve the recorder. Adam's tape urges him to escape the bathroom, while Lawrence's tape tells him to kill Adam by six o'clock, or {{his wife and daughter}} will be killed and he will be left to die. Adam finds a bag containing two hacksaws inside a toilet tank; they attempt to cut through the chains, but Adam's saw breaks and he throws it at <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> in frustration, revealing a hidden camera behind <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> Lawrence realizes that the hacksaws weren't meant for the chains, but for their feet and identifies their captor as the Jigsaw Killer, whom Lawrence knows of because he was a suspect five months before.|$|E

50|$|In some implementations, <b>the</b> <b>mirrored</b> disk can {{be split}} off {{and used for}} data backup, {{allowing}} the first disk to remain active.

5|$|Another {{approach}} to understanding mirror symmetry was suggested by Andrew Strominger, Shing-Tung Yau, and Eric Zaslow in 1996. According to their conjecture, {{now known as}} the SYZ conjecture, mirror symmetry can be understood by dividing a Calabi–Yau manifold into simpler pieces and then transforming them to get <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> Calabi–Yau.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{findings}} correlating mirror neuron {{activity and}} mu wave suppression in individuals with autism as in typically developing individuals, {{studies have examined}} both the development of mirror neurons and therapeutic means for stimulating the system. A recent study has found that fMRI activation magnitudes in the inferior frontal gyrus increase with age in people with autism. This finding was not apparent in typically developing individuals. Furthermore, greater activation was associated with greater amounts of eye contact and better social functioning. Scientists believe the inferior frontal gyrus {{is one of the}} main neural correlates with <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> neuron system in humans and is often related to deficits associated with autism. These findings suggest that <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> neuron system may not be non-functional in individuals with autism, but simply abnormal in its development. This information is significant to the present discussion because mu waves may be integrating different areas of mirror neuron activity in the brain. Other studies have assessed attempts to consciously stimulate <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> neuron system and suppress mu waves using neurofeedback (a type of biofeedback given through computers that analyze real time recordings of brain activity, in this case EEGs of mu waves). This type of therapy is still in its early phases of implementation for individuals with autism, and has conflicting forecasts for success.|$|E
5|$|By {{studying}} {{the relationship between}} Calabi–Yau manifolds and certain conformal field theories called Gepner models, Brian Greene and Ronen Plesser found nontrivial examples of <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> relationship. Further evidence for this relationship came {{from the work of}} Philip Candelas, Monika Lynker, and Rolf Schimmrigk, who surveyed a large number of Calabi–Yau manifolds by computer and found that they came in mirror pairs.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} the study of {{multilayer}} mirrors designed to compress extreme-ultraviolet pulses below 50 as. <b>The</b> <b>mirrors</b> were optimized in the time- domain to get the wanted pulse shape and duration when combined with a broadband hybrid filter. Moreover they appeared to be very robust to environmental parameters, ensuring a pulse compression in various conditions. We manufactured <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> and characterized them on a synchrotron facility both in amplitude and phase. The measurement of the latter was performed using the photocurrent technique, which is the only method allowing one to access to <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> absolute spectral phase. This led to a measurement of the offset induced by one of <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> on <b>the</b> carrier-envelope phase of attosecond pulses...|$|R
50|$|The design encapsulates {{the solar}} thermal system within a greenhouse-like {{glasshouse}}. The glasshouse creates a protected environment {{to withstand the}} elements that can negatively impact reliability and efficiency of the solar thermal system. Lightweight curved solar-reflecting mirrors are suspended from {{the ceiling of the}} glasshouse by wires. A single-axis tracking system positions <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> to retrieve <b>the</b> optimal amount of sunlight. <b>The</b> <b>mirrors</b> concentrate <b>the</b> sunlight and focus it on a network of stationary steel pipes, also suspended from the glasshouse structure. Water is carried throughout the length of the pipe, which is boiled to generate steam when intense solar radiation is applied. Sheltering <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> from <b>the</b> wind allows them to achieve higher temperature rates and prevents dust from building up on <b>the</b> <b>mirrors.</b>|$|R

5|$|Early {{sources on}} Richard Neville {{fall into two}} categories. The first are the {{sympathetic}} chronicles of the early Yorkist years, or works based on these, such as <b>the</b> <b>Mirror</b> for Magistrates (1559). The other category originates with chronicles commissioned by Edward IV after Warwick's fall, such as the Historie of the arrivall of Edward IV, and take a more negative view of the earl. <b>The</b> <b>Mirror</b> portrayed Warwick as a great man: beloved by the people, and betrayed by the man he helped raise to the throne. The other perspective {{can be found in}} Shakespeare's Henry VI trilogy: a man driven by pride and egotism, who created and deposed kings at will.|$|E
