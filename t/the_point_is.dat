5|$|The classic {{point in}} polygon test from {{computational}} geometry applies the above ideas. To {{determine if a}} point lies within a polygon, one casts a ray from infinity to the point and counts {{the number of times}} the ray crosses the edge of polygon. The crossing number is even if and only if <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> outside the polygon. This algorithm works because if the ray never crosses the polygon, then its crossing number is zero, which is even, and <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> outside. Every time the ray does cross the polygon, the crossing number alternates between even and odd, and the point at its tip alternates between outside and inside.|$|E
5|$|The {{light is}} {{operated}} by Roads and Maritime Services, while {{the site is}} managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service {{as part of the}} Tomaree National Park, in which it is located. Visiting the lighthouse is difficult. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> connected to the mainland with a narrow tombolo, and is only accessible by foot at low tide. It is accessible by boat, and the grounds are open, though the tower is closed to the public.|$|E

5|$|Golondrina points (formerly Plainview Golondrina) are {{lanceolate}} spear or dart projectile points, {{of medium}} size, dated to the transitional Paleo-Indian Period, between 9000–7000 BP. Golondrina points were attached on split-stem hafts {{and may have}} served to bring down medium-sized animals such as deer, as well as functioning as butchering knives. Distribution is widespread throughout most of Texas, and points have also been discovered in Arkansas and Mexico. The concentration of Golondrina specimens is highest across the South Texas Plains, where <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> the most prevalent of Paleo-Indian types and defines a distinctive cultural pattern for the region. The Golondrina point is so named for its flared basal corners ("ears"), which resemble a swallow's (golondrina in Spanish) split tail. Classification of Golondrina can be difficult because of its similarity to other types, particularly the Plainview point, to which it was originally thought to be related.|$|E
5|$|A Twenty-Man Gauntlet for the Gold to {{determine}} the number contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship was held at Hard Justice. The match was announced on the April 29 episode of Impact! by DOA Rhodes. In a Gauntlet for the Gold, two wrestlers start the bout, with more entering at time intervals, in which <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> to eliminate the opponent by throwing them over the top rope and to the floor. When the match is down to two wrestlers, a standard match is held, with the winner being the one to gain the pinfall or submission. On the May 6 episode of Impact!, Abyss was announced as a participant in the match. TNA held a Ten-Man Gauntlet on the May 13 episode of Impact! {{to determine}} the first and final entrants in the match, with the first eliminated in the match entering first while the winner being the last entrant. Abyss, Bobby Roode, David Young, A-1, Chris Sabin, Petey Williams, Lance Hoyt, Michael Shane, Trytan, and Apolo all participated in the bout, with Roode being the first eliminated and Abyss winning the contest.|$|E
5|$|Villermé’s Tableau {{discussed}} {{the role of}} industrialization on the general health {{and quality of life}} for the laboring class. His perspective in this work is unique in that he maintained that the process of industrialization is not completely to blame. He even suggested the industrial movement to be beneficial for the future of society, calling on examples of industrialization in the United States. He also {{discussed the}} role of children working in the textile industry. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> made that, in some cases, {{at least half of the}} workforce in a textile factory was made up of the children of textile workers, many under the age of eighteen. Villermé contrasted the quality of life of workers who maintained family life with those taken over completely by their labor. He blamed both the working conditions associated with industrialization as well as the workers themselves to an extent. This work served not only as valuable information to medical institutions and boards, but also as a social statement, widely accepted by the public. It is from this work that Villermé received his reputation as a moral economist.|$|E

25|$|Two nodes {{attached}} by an order-n branch {{can create}} an n-gon if <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> on one mirror, and a 2n-gon if <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> off both mirrors. This forms the I1(n) group.|$|E
25|$|Two unattached nodes {{represent}} two perpendicular mirrors. If both nodes are ringed, {{a rectangle}} can be created, or a square if <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> {{at equal distance from}} both mirrors.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the disk}} used is the open unit disk {{and one of}} <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> origin and Euclidean {{distance}} between <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>is</b> r then <b>the</b> hyperbolic distance is: [...] Where arctanh is the inverse function of the hyperbolic tangent.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>point</b> {{system used}} <b>was</b> {{similar to other}} race series in that <b>the</b> most <b>points</b> <b>are</b> awarded to <b>the</b> first place {{finisher}} and <b>points</b> <b>are</b> reduced for subsequent finishing places. The Volkswagen Jetta TDI Cup is unique in that <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>are</b> halved for <b>the</b> first two races compared to <b>the</b> <b>points</b> for <b>the</b> rest of the season.|$|R
50|$|During the Ice Age, <b>the</b> <b>point</b> then unnamed <b>was</b> about a {{kilometer}} west. The island along with <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> first discovered by António da Noli in 1460. Before {{the northern part}} was settled around the 16th century, the area was forested probably most of the headland. The area around <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> first settled around {{the mid to late}} 16th century.|$|R
25|$|In {{algebraic}} geometry, UFDs arise {{because of}} smoothness. More precisely, {{a point in}} a variety (over a perfect field) is smooth if the local ring at <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> a regular local ring. A regular local ring is a UFD.|$|E
25|$|The part of {{the blade}} between the center of {{percussion}} (CoP) and <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> called the foible (weak) of the blade, and that between the center of balance (CoB) and the hilt is the forte (strong). The section in between the CoP and the CoB is the middle.|$|E
25|$|A Cauchy filter {{is called}} minimal if it {{contains}} no smaller (i.e., coarser) Cauchy filter (other than itself). It {{can be shown}} that every Cauchy filter contains a unique minimal Cauchy filter. The neighbourhood filter of each point (the filter consisting of all neighbourhoods of <b>the</b> <b>point)</b> <b>is</b> a minimal Cauchy filter.|$|E
50|$|Note that <b>the</b> lower <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> {{better it}} is for the player. The player with <b>the</b> lowest <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> winner, while the player with <b>the</b> highest <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> biggest loser. <b>Points</b> can also <b>be</b> {{optionally}} recorded, {{so that they can be}} summed up at the end of a gaming session to determine overall winner.|$|R

25|$|The {{point at}} which the {{material}} cannot flow is called the coherency point. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> difficult to predict in mold design because it is dependent on the solid fraction, the structure of the solidified particles, and the local shear strain rate of the fluid. Usually this value ranges from 0.4 to 0.8.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{it may well}} happen that an empty {{intersection}} belongs to neither player's territory. In that case <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> said to be neutral territory. There are rarely {{any more than a}} handful of neutral points at the end of a game; in the majority of cases, there are none at all.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> {{that the}} idea of space {{vehicles}} shaped like flying saucers was imprinted in the national psyche for many years prior to 1947, when the Roswell incident took place. It didn't take much stretching for the first observers of UFOs to assume that the unknown objects hovering in the sky had the same disk shape as the science fictional vehicles.|$|E
5000|$|At [...] (<b>the</b> {{bifurcation}} <b>point)</b> there <b>is</b> {{exactly one}} equilibrium point. At this <b>point</b> <b>the</b> fixed <b>point</b> <b>is</b> no longer hyperbolic. In this case <b>the</b> fixed <b>point</b> <b>is</b> called a saddle-node fixed point.|$|R

25|$|The {{good deed}} {{is a key}} {{component}} of the law and promise. Baden-Powell felt this is the main duty God asks for, and fulfilling our duty to others makes us happy, which fulfills the duty to ourselves. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> not so much the deed itself, which could be minor, but to teach the Scout to always pay attention and recognise if he could help someone.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> {{that after}} 4.d4 g5 5.h4 g4 White cannot {{continue}} with 6.Ne5 {{as in the}} Kieseritzky Gambit, 6.Ng5 is unsound because of 6...f6! trapping the knight, and 6.Nfd2 blocks the bishop on c1. This leaves the move 6.Ng1 as the only option, when after six moves neither side has developed a piece. The resulting slightly odd position (diagram) offers White good attacking chances.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} a set X of distinct <b>points</b> in <b>the</b> n-dimensional projective space over an algebraically closed field k.

Green's Strong Castelnuovo Lemma (SCL) shows that if <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>are</b> in general position, then an− 1 (X) ≠ 0 if {{and only if}} <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>are</b> on a rational normal curve. Cavaliere, Rossi and Valla (1995) conjectured in [2] that if <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>are</b> not necessarily in general position the possible extension of the SCL should be the following: an− 1 (X) ≠ 0 {{if and only if}} either <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>are</b> on a rational normal curve or in the union of two linear subspaces whose dimensions add up to n. In this work we prove the conjecture...|$|R
