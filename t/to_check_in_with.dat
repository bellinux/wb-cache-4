500|$|The A.V.

[...] Murray continued that he [...] "especially liked... that in the midst of all this end-times rush, it pauses periodically <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> the various characters in short one-on-one scenes, strengthening our sense of what these relationships mean. (It's something that Fringe has gotten good at in the past year-and-a-half, and something I wouldn't have predicted for the show back in season one.)" [...] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, critic Andrew Hanson noted Fringe is preparing for the finale, calling [...] "6:02 AM EST" [...] a [...] "movement episode [...] give an opportunity to get everyone into place for the big climax" [...] in a vein similar to the television series Lost.

The episode {{is only one of}} two season premieres Cherry did not write himself, as he took on a reduced production role for the eighth season in order to develop several new series while Daily was given more creative authority. According to Daily, the series' ending allowed the writers more artistic freedom while developing storylines. [...] "You get to do story lines that you wouldn't otherwise do because you don't {{have to worry about the}} ramifications," [...] he explained. [...] "So people can move, people can die, people can have babies and you don't have to worry about the babies growing up." [...] The episode introduced Bree's blackmail storyline, which recalls the first season's mystery storyline surrounding series narrator Mary Alice's suicide. Daily stated that the similarity between the storylines was intentional: [...] "We’re kind of just diving into the DNA of the series a little bit. Are there any unanswered questions floating around out there? Any characters we need <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> one more time?" [...] Cherry noted that the [...] "mystery hearkens back to the first season, going back to the roots of Mary Alice [...] This feels right for that mystery to take us out this year." [...] Brenda Strong commented that [...] "It’s the smartest way to end the series, to finish where you began. I think it really cements it in the psyche of the audience and gives them a sense of completion." ...|$|E

In order to address this problem, the purpose of this study was to explore and understand the role of family on the eating behaviors and food choices of Malaysian students who live apart from their families. Five Malaysian students at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln were interviewed. Six themes were identified in this study; “family plays an important role,” “family mealtimes,” parental preferences and decision-making, parental advice, “lasting habits,” and culture and family history.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} issues of {{identification}} in parametric dis-crete choice panel data models with fixed effects {{when the number of}} time periods is fixed.

Alternatively, if such a hyperplane restriction holds with probability zero, the semipara-metric information bound is shown to be zero. I use these results to investigate identification in a variety of panel binary choice models.

5000|$|On January 25, 2017, Trump signed Executive Order 13768 which, {{among other}} things, {{significantly}} {{increased the number}} of immigrants considered a priority for deportation. Previously, under Obama, an immigrant ruled removable would only be considered a priority to actually be physically deported if they, in addition to being removable, were convicted of serious crimes such as felonies or multiple misdemeanors. Under the Trump administration, such an immigrant can be considered a priority to be removed even if convicted only of minor crimes, or even if merely accused of such criminal activity. Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, who came illegally to the United States when she was 14, may have become the first person deported under the terms of this order on February 9, 2017. Garcia de Rayos had previously been convicted of felony criminal impersonation related to her use of a falsified Social Security card to work at an Arizona water park. This conviction had not been considered serious enough, under Obama, to actually remove her from the country, although she was required <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>in</b> regularly <b>with</b> ICE officials, which she had done regularly since 2008. The first time she <b>checked</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> ICE officials after the new executive order took effect, however, led to her detention and physical removal from the country. Greg Stanton, the Mayor of Phoenix commented that [...] "Rather than tracking down violent criminals and drug dealers, ICE is spending its energy deporting a woman with two American children who has lived here {{for more than two decades}} and poses a threat to nobody." [...] ICE officials said that her case went through multiple reviews in the immigration court system and that the [...] "judges held she did not have a legal basis to remain in the US".|$|R
40|$|In the {{framework}} of quantum information geometry, we derive, from quantum relative Tsallis entropy, a family of quantum metrics on the space of full rank, N level quantum states, {{by means of a}} suitably defined coordinate free differential calculus. The cases N = 2, N = 3 are discussed in detail and notable limits are analyzed. The radial limit procedure has been used to recover quantum metrics for lower rank states, such as pure states. By using the tomographic picture of quantum mechanics we have obtained the Fisher- Rao metric for the space of quantum tomograms and derived a reconstruction formula of the quantum metric of density states out of the tomographic one.

40|$|The Ultimate Limit State (ULS) is {{commonly}} used when assessing masonry arch bridges. Traditionally one or more, relatively large, partial factors are applied to the ULS to determine the level of service loading that can be safely applied to a given bridge.

To address this, an alternative, more discriminating, measure, the ‘Permissible Limit State’ (PLS) has recently been proposed, <b>to</b> be <b>checked</b> <b>in</b> conjunction <b>with</b> the ULS.
