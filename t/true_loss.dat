An insurable interest is that legal or equitable relationship between the insured and {{the subject matter of the}} insurance, separate from the existence of the insurance relationship, by which the insured would be prejudiced by the occurrence of the event insured against, or conversely would take a benefit from its non-occurrence. Insurable interest was long held to be morally necessary in insurance contracts to distinguish them, as enforceable contracts, from unenforceable gambling agreements (binding [...] "in honour" [...] only) and to quell the practice, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, of taking out life policies upon the lives of strangers. The requirement for insurable interest was removed in non-marine English law, possibly inadvertently, by the provisions of the Gambling Act 2005. [...] It remains a requirement in marine insurance law and other common law systems, however; and few systems of law will allow an insured to recover in respect of an event that has not caused the insured a genuine loss, whether the insurable interest doctrine is relied upon, or whether, as in common law systems, the courts rely upon the principle of indemnity to hold that an insured may not recover more than his <b>true</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|E
50|$|John Shaw {{and other}} historians, {{military}} and civilian, have based {{the conclusions of}} their work on the incursion {{on the premise that}} the North Vietnamese logistical system in Cambodia had been so badly damaged that it was rendered ineffective. The next large-scale North Vietnamese offensive, the Nguyen Hue Offensive of 1972 (called the Easter Offensive in the West) would be launched out of southern North Vietnam and western Laos, not from Cambodia, was cited as proof positive that the Cambodian operations had succeeded. The fact that PAVN forces were otherwise occupied in Cambodia and had no such offensive plan (so far as is known) was seemingly irrelevant. The fact that logistically, a northern offensive (especially a conventional one backed by armour and heavy artillery) would be launched closer to its source of manpower and supply also seemed to be of little consequence.The logistical haul discovered, removed, or destroyed in eastern Cambodia during the operations was indeed prodigious: 20,000 individual and 2,500 crew-served weapons; 7,000 to 8,000 tons of rice; 1,800 tons of ammunition (including 143,000 mortar shells, rockets, and recoilless rifle rounds); 29 tons of communications equipment; 431 vehicles; and 55 tons of medical supplies.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the consistency analysis on listwise ranking meth-ods. Among various ranking methods, the listwise methods have competitive per-formances on benchmark datasets and are {{regarded as one of the}} state-of-the-art approaches. Most listwise ranking methods manage to optimize ranking on the whole list (permutation) of objects, however, in practical applications such as in-formation retrieval, correct ranking at the top k positions is much more important. This paper aims to analyze whether existing listwise ranking methods are statisti-cally consistent in the top-k setting. For this purpose, we define a top-k ranking framework, where the <b>true</b> <b>loss</b> (and thus the risks) are defined on the basis of top-k subgroup of permutations. This framework can include the permutation-level ranking framework proposed in previous work as a special case. Based on the new framework, we derive sufficient conditions for a listwise ranking method to be consistent with the top-k <b>true</b> <b>loss,</b> and show an effective way of modifying the surrogate loss functions in existing methods to satisfy these conditions. Experi-mental results show that after the modification, the methods can work significantly better than their original versions, indicating the correctness of our theoretical analysis. ...|$|E

40|$|Fraud causes {{substantial}} {{losses to}} telecommunication carriers. Detection systems which automatically detect illegal {{use of the}} network {{can be used to}} alleviate the problem. Previous approaches worked on features derived from the call patterns of individual users. In this paper we present a call-based detection system based on a hierarchical regime-switching model. The detection problem is formulated as an inference problem on the regime probabilities. Inference is implemented by applying the junction tree algorithm to the underlying graphical model. The dynamics are learned from data using the EM algorithm and subsequent discriminative training. The methods are assessed using fraud data from a real mobile communication network. 1 INTRODUCTION Fraud is costly to a network carrier both in terms of lost income and wasted capacity.

40|$|Structured {{prediction}} {{is the problem}} of learning a function from structured inputs to structured outputs. Inspired by the recent successes of search-based structured prediction, we introduce a new framework for structured prediction called HC-Search. Given a structured input, the framework uses a search procedure guided by a learned heuristic H to uncover high quality candidate outputs and then uses a separate learned cost function C to select a final prediction among those outputs. We can decompose the regret of the overall approach into the loss due to H not leading to high quality outputs, and the loss due to C not selecting the best among the generated outputs. Guided by this decomposition, we minimize the overall regret in a greedy stagewise manner by first training H to quickly uncover high quality outputs via imitation learning, and then training C to correctly rank the outputs generated via H according to their <b>true</b> <b>losses.</b> Experiments on several benchmark domains show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. ...|$|R
