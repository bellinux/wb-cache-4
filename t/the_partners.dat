40|$|This {{longitudinal}} {{study examined the}} crossover of performance self-esteem within working couples. We focused on the long-term crossover process {{as well as its}} work-related consequences. We hypothesized that one <b>partner’s</b> (<b>the</b> actor’s) performance self-esteem relates to changes in <b>the</b> other <b>partner’s</b> (<b>the</b> <b>partner’s)</b> performance self-esteem over time, especially if <b>the</b> <b>partner</b> has a low level of baseline performance self-esteem. In a final step, we expected that <b>the</b> <b>partner’s</b> performance self-esteem at Time 2 in turn predicts <b>the</b> <b>partner’s</b> work engagement. Using a {{longitudinal study}} (time lag: 6 months) among 294 dual-earner couples, we tested our hypotheses with multilevel analyses applying the Actor–Partner Interdependence Model. The actor’s performance self-esteem at Time 1 did not directly relate to <b>the</b> <b>partner’s</b> performance self-esteem at Time 2. However, as expected, we found a significant moderation of <b>the</b> <b>partner’s</b> baseline performance self-esteem in the crossover process, indicating that especially individuals with a rather low baseline performance self-esteem are susceptible to performance self-esteem crossover. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>partner’s</b> performance self-esteem was related to <b>the</b> <b>partner’s</b> work engagement at Time 2...|$|R

The study indicated that the building could be economically refurbished, and in December 1996 the Council unanimously agreed to press ahead with refurbishment plans, removing its asbestos and building an underground car park {{at the rear of the}} site. The decision to refurbish was helped by the fact that interest rates at the time were so low that it was cheaper to service a loan than to pay rent.
