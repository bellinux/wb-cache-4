5|$|Most {{people with}} SCI have {{problems}} with the body's physical sexual arousal response. Problems that result directly from impaired neural transmission are called primary sexual dysfunction. The function of the genitals is almost always affected by SCI, by alteration, reduction, or complete loss of sensation.

5|$|There is some dispute as to if this pyramid was Ahmose's burial place, {{or if it}} was a cenotaph. Although earlier explorers Mace and Currelly {{were unable}} to locate any {{internal}} chambers, it is unlikely that a burial chamber would have been located {{in the midst of the}} pyramid's rubble core. In <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> mention of a tomb of King Ahmose in the tomb robbery accounts of the Abbott Papyrus, and in <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> likely candidate for the king's tomb at Thebes, it is possible that the king was interred at Abydos, as suggested by Harvey. Certainly the great number of cult structures located at the base of the pyramid located in recent years, as well as the presence at the base of the pyramid of a cemetery used by priests of Ahmose's cult, argue for the importance of the king's Abydos cult. However, other Egyptologists believe that the pyramid was constructed (like Tetisheri's pyramid at Abydos) as a cenotaph and that Ahmose may have originally been buried in the southern part of Dra' Abu el-Naga' with the rest of the late 17th and early 18th Dynasties.|$|E

5|$|Amanita regalis {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from A.muscaria by <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> red {{color in the}} cap, and the yellow patches on the stem.

The latter species can be identified by the flesh-colored tinge it stains when cut or bruised, and also by the color of the flesh underneath the cuticle: A.regalis is yellowish while A.rubescens is white. Amanita pantherina has a similar color, but has white flesh below the cap cuticle, and a cup-shaped bulb with distinct margins around the edge.|$|E
