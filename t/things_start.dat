500|$|Guitar Hero {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} upon release. It received {{a score of}} 91.96% on GameRankings and 91/100 on Metacritic. IGN praised the [...] "fantastic soundtrack" [...] and [...] "great peripheral", further commenting that mini-Gibson SG controller [...] "is what makes Guitar Hero, rather than what breaks it". GameSpot echoed these sentiments, stating Guitar Hero had a [...] "great guitar controller" [...] and [...] "killer soundtrack" [...] and was possibly the [...] "best rhythm game ever made". Many reviews praised the game's gradual learning curve and difficulty approach through the song tier progression and the difficulty setting for each song. Play said the game [...] "gives bedroom air guitarists {{a chance to live}} out their rock 'n' roll fantasies". GameSpys review commented on the length of the songs, in that [...] "once you hit the three minute mark or so, <b>things</b> <b>start</b> to feel 'too long'". Eurogamer said, [...] "the lack of international star quality about the roster of songs and the absence of the original artists is perhaps the only thing that may detract from the package from an importer's perspective" [...] and [...] "it would have been truly amazing with a better track list".|$|E

500|$|In 1999, the {{ownership}} of Candlelight Records changed hands, with owner and friend of the band Lee Barrett leaving the company. Opeth signed with UK label Peaceville Records in Europe, which was distributed by Music for Nations. Opeth reserved time at Studio Fredman to begin work on its next album, but recording was postponed while the studio was relocated. Due to time constraints, the band was able to rehearse only twice before entering the studio. Delays with the album's artwork pushed the release back an additional month and Still Life was released on October 18, 1999. Due to problems with the band's new distribution network, the album was not released in the United States until February 2001. Still Life was the first album recorded with Méndez, and also the first Opeth album to bear any kind of caption on the front cover upon its initial release, including the band's logo. Allmusic called Still Life a [...] "formidable splicing of harsh, often jagged guitar riffs with graceful melodies." [...] As explained by Åkerfeldt, Still Life is a concept album: [...] "The main character is kind of banished from his hometown because he hasn't got the same faith {{as the rest of}} the inhabitants there. The album pretty much starts off when he is returning after several years to hook up with his old 'babe.' The big bosses of the town know that he's back... A lot of bad <b>things</b> <b>start</b> happening." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews for 1984 were {{generally}} favorable. Robert Christgau rated the album a B+. He explained that [...] "Side one is pure up, {{and not only}} that, it sticks to the ears" [...] and that [...] "Van Halen's pop move avoids fluff because they're heavy and schlock because they're built for speed, finally creating an all-purpose mise-en-scene for Brother Eddie's hair-raising, stomach-churning chops." [...] He also called side two [...] "consolation for their loyal fans—a little sexism, a lot of pyrotechnics, and a standard HM bass attack on something called 'House of Pain'." [...] J.D. Considine, a reviewer for Rolling Stone, rated 1984 {{four out of five}} stars. He called it [...] "the album that brings all of Van Halen's talent into focus." [...] He stated that [...] ""Jump" [...] is not exactly the kind of song you'd expect from Van Halen", but that [...] "once Alex Van Halen's drums kick in and singer David Lee Roth starts to unravel a typically convoluted story line, <b>things</b> <b>start</b> sounding a little more familiar". Although he mentioned [...] "Jump" [...] as having [...] "suspended chords and a pedalpoint bass in a manner more suited to Asia", he went on to state that [...] "Eddie Van Halen manages to expand his repertoire of hot licks, growls, screams and seemingly impossible runs to wilder frontiers than you could have imagined." [...] He concluded that [...] "what really makes this record work is the fact that Van Halen uses all this flash as a means to an end—driving the melody home—rather than as an end in itself" [...] and that [...] "despite all the bluster, Van Halen is one of the smartest, toughest bands in rock & roll. Believe me, that's no newspeak." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{success of}} the [...] "nu-disco" [...] revival of the early 2000s was {{described}} by music critic Tom Ewing as more interpersonal than the pop music of the 1990s: [...] "The revival of disco within pop put a spotlight on something that had gone missing over the 90s: a sense of music not just for dancing, but for dancing with someone. Disco was a music of mutual attraction: cruising, flirtation, negotiation. Its dancefloor is a space for immediate pleasure, but also for promises kept and otherwise. It’s a place where <b>things</b> <b>start,</b> but their resolution, let alone their meaning, is never clear. All of 2000s great disco number ones explore how to play this hand. Madison Avenue look to impose their will upon it, to set terms and roles. Spiller is less rigid. 'Groovejet' accepts the night’s changeability, happily sells out certainty for an amused smile and a few great one-liners." ...|$|E
