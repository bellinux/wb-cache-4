5|$|After the war, of course, {{the roads}} were all bad. There were cobbles from <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>you</b> left Paris, or Senlis where we started in those days. There'd be {{stretches}} of surfaced roads and often there'd be a cycle path or a pavement and sometimes a thin stretch of something smoother. But you never knew where was best to ride and you were for ever switching about. You could jump your bike up on to a pavement but that got harder the more tired you got. Then you'd get your front wheel up but not your back wheel. That happened to me. And then you'd go sprawling, of course, and you could bring other riders down. Or they'd fall off and bring you down with them. And the cycle paths were often just compressed cinders, which got soft {{in the rain and}} got churned up by so many riders using them and then you got stuck and you lost your balance. And come what may, you got covered in coal dust and other muck. No, it's all changed and you can't compare then and now.|$|E

She {{acknowledged}} the controversy stirred by the publication of the first part, but continued writing {{the second part of the}} book, and she worked on her autobiography Eighty Years & More: Reminiscences 1815–1897. She wrote to her longtime friend Reverend Antoinette Brown Blackwell in April, 1896 to observe: [...] "Our politicians are calm and complacent under our fire but the clergy jump round <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>you</b> aim a pop gun at them 'like parched peas on a hot skillet'".|$|E

500|$|According to Lo, {{the songs}} on her {{extended}} play Truth Serum are about her [...] "most intense" [...] failed relationship. She stated, [...] "In its entirety, [...] a love story from beginning to end. The song 'Love Ballad' is about <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>you</b> decide to give everything to another person, while 'Habits' shows what happens when everything is screwed up and {{you just want to}} freak out. 'Out of Mind' deals with the stage after that, when your broken heart has mended, but the scars are still there". In an interview with Klap Magazine, Lo said, [...] "'Love Ballad' is actually supposed to be a way of telling the one I love I'd do anything for him. He's worth the pain.

500|$|In 1870 he was {{appointed}} a judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia and retired from his government post. Crease was suspicious of both Confederation and responsible government, largely because they threatened greater government control over judges and central Canadian domination of patronage. Like many British Columbians, he was disappointed that London seemed to {{have given up on}} BC as an independent colony, abandoning either it to annexation to the United States or confederation with Canada. [...] "I believe that England is sick of her Colonies," [...] he wrote, [...] "and to be a Colonist, whatever your POSITION & CHARACTER when at Home – is to lose Caste <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>you</b> become a bona fide settler." [...] Regardless of his opposition to Confederation, Crease was chosen to prepare for it as the chair of the Royal Commission for the Revision of Laws of BC.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} offered Dr. No to Guy Green, Guy Hamilton, Val Guest and Ken Hughes to direct, {{but all of}} them {{turned it}} down. They finally signed Terence Young who had a long background with Broccoli's Warwick Films as the director. Broccoli and Saltzman felt that Young would {{be able to make a}} real impression of James Bond and transfer the essence of the character from book to film. Young imposed many stylistic choices for the character which continued throughout the film series. Young also decided to inject much humour, as he considered that [...] "a lot of things in this film, the sex and violence and so on, if played straight, a) would be objectionable, and b) we're never gonna go past the censors; but <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>you</b> take the mickey out, put the tongue out in the cheek, it seems to disarm." ...|$|E
500|$|Zappa in New York {{featured}} {{a song about}} sex criminal Michael H. Kenyon, [...] "The Illinois Enema Bandit", which featured Don Pardo providing the opening narrative in the song. Like many songs on the album, it contained numerous sexual references, leading to many critics objecting and being offended by the content. Zappa dismissed the criticism by noting {{that he was a}} journalist reporting on life as he saw it. Predating his later fight against censorship, he remarked: [...] "What do you make of a society that is so primitive that it clings to the belief that certain words in its language are so powerful that they could corrupt you <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>you</b> hear them?" [...] The remaining albums released by Warner Bros. Records without Zappa's consent were Studio Tan in 1978 and Sleep Dirt and Orchestral Favorites in 1979, which contained complex suites of instrumentally-based tunes recorded between 1973 and 1976, and whose release was overlooked {{in the midst of the}} legal problems.|$|E

500|$|Wizards & Warriors has {{received}} scant coverage from modern video gaming websites. Video gaming website GamesRadar named the opening {{theme for the}} game as [...] "Game music of the day", noting that the theme [...] "suggests, from <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>you</b> turn on the game, that knights, wizards, goblins {{and who knows what}} else are about to collide in a battle so epic it's destined for a Frazetta painting." [...] JC Fletcher from Joystiq called the game [...] "a simple action-platformer about a guy in thick armor who kicks open treasure chests in order to bribe knights". He also notes the variety of good and bad items such as the [...] "Staff of Power" [...] which inflicts much damage to enemies and conversely the [...] "Cloak of Darkness", which he says [...] "makes Kuros invisible to you but not to enemies". He said that the game has an arcade feel, with unlimited continues, a high-score list, name entry for high scores, and good music. Houston Press Jef Rouner lauded the game's music and animation, and noted its high difficulty level, especially during boss battles. IGN listed Wizards & Warriors at #56 on its [...] "Top 100 NES Games" [...] list, reviewer Sam Claiborn said that the game was inspired by Dungeons & Dragons-type RPGs, but it went further in incorporating action platforming elements along with more traditional RPG elements. Columnist and comedy writer Seanbaby humorously criticized the game for items that did not work as intended, including the [...] "Cloak of Darkness" [...] and the [...] "Boots of Lava Walk".|$|E
500|$|... "Fearless" [...] {{was written}} by Swift in {{collaboration}} with Liz Rose and Hillary Lindsey and produced by Nathan Chapman alongside Swift. Swift conceived the song while touring as opening act {{in order to promote}} her eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift (2006). While writing the song, she was not dating anyone or [...] "even in the beginning stages of dating anybody." [...] She wrote the song after she analyzed the ideology of what was the best first date. While developing [...] "Fearless", Swift explained the writing process, stating, [...] "I think sometimes when you’re writing love songs, you don’t write them about what you’re going through at <b>the</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>you</b> write about what you wish you had." [...] The song was composed with two concepts in mind. Swift described the song's primary concept to be about [...] "the fearlessness of falling in love", and [...] "no matter how many times you get hurt, you will always fall in love again." [...] The second, is about the best first date, which Swift stated she hadn't experienced at the time of writing [...] "Fearless". After completing the song, Swift deeply deliberated her personal definition of the word [...] "fearless". To her, [...] "fearless doesn't mean you're completely unafraid and it doesn't mean that you're bulletproof. It means that {{you have a lot of}} fears, but you jump anyway." [...] That influenced her to title the album Fearless. The song was first released as a promotional single from the album on October 14, 2008 as part of Countdown to Fearless an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store; it was later released as the fifth and final single from Fearless on January 4, 2010.|$|E
500|$|A black marketeer {{who makes}} a living dealing Kaiju organs. Perlman stated, [...] "I {{actually}} think this character {{was designed to be}} played by another ethnicity other than myself. And somewhere along the way, [...] had the notion, 'Wouldn't it be interesting to turn this guy into more of an invention.' So, in other words, somebody takes on a persona that completely sounds like he's someone else and acts like he's someone else but he's really, you know, as you see me. That added a dimension to the larger-than-life aspect of the character… I'm playing somebody very close to my own origins. But a completely made-up persona… which makes him even more full of shit. And I think that's the charm of the guy—that he's kind of elusive, hard to pin down." [...] Pacific Rim marks Perlman's fifth appearance in a del Toro film. The director stated: [...] "I think <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>you</b> have a guy that is called Hannibal Chau and Ron shows up, and he's from Brooklyn and he's been selling black market organs, you know the whole story… That's all I need to know. If it's any other actor, there's a lot more explaining to do. But when Ron comes in with that look, {{you can make your own}} story and it'll be as compelling as anything I can invent. You do a little weightlifting with the audience." [...] The bird tattoos on Chau's fingers indicate his past as a gangster. In the film, Chau states he took the name from his favorite historical figure and his second-favorite Szechuan restaurant in Brooklyn. Del Toro drew inspiration from Burt Lancaster's performance in Elmer Gantry when writing the character.|$|E

500|$|In an interview, Lo {{summarised}} the storyline of the EP; [...] "The song 'Love Ballad' {{is about}} <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>you</b> decide to give everything to another person, while 'Habits' shows {{what happens when}} everything is screwed up and {{you just want to}} freak out. 'Out of Mind' deals with the stage after that, when your broken heart has mended, but the scars are still there". The EP's main genres are pop, electropop and indie pop. The Swedish edition of Truth Serum opens with [...] "Love Ballad", a pop song with drum instrumentation. It was described as a [...] "parody of love songs" [...] that talks about the [...] "carefree beginnings of a new romance". Lo also called it a [...] "way of telling the one I love I'd do anything for him". In the standard edition, the EP opens with [...] "Not on Drugs", a pop, dance and electropop song in which the artist compares falling in love to being under the influence of drugs. Following the narrative of Truth Serum, it represents the happy beginning of the relationship, when Lo was [...] "really in love" [...] and [...] " [...] think straight". [...] "Paradise" [...] is a jungle and drum and bass song with electronic elements; it talks about the moment when Lo realizes that she needs and relies on her partner. The electropop song [...] "Over" [...] details the part when Lo and her boyfriend end the relationship. The singer stated that it was about [...] "me making a big mistake and having to confess and come clean". [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] is a pop and electropop track which talks about the artist's hedonistic attempts to forget her former boyfriend. [...] "Out of Mind" [...] is a pop song with minimal instrumentation. According to Lo, it represents the part when [...] "I have the pain and I'm trying to get over this heartbreak. It's when you moved on and you're sort of okay, but you still have that little scar". The EP's last track is the downtempo [...] "Stay High", a remix version of [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] by record production duo Hippie Sabotage.|$|E

2500|$|Although One Hundred Years of Solitude {{has come}} to be {{considered}} one of, if not the, most influential Latin American texts of all time, the novel and Gabriel García Márquez have both received occasional criticisms. Stylistically, Harold Bloom remarked that [...] "My primary impression, in the act of rereading One Hundred Years of Solitude, is a kind of aesthetic battle fatigue, since every page is rammed full of life beyond the capacity of any single reader to absorb... There are no wasted sentences, no mere transitions, in this novel, and you must notice everything at <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>you</b> read it." [...] Additionally, David Haberly alleges that García Márquez may have borrowed themes from several works, such as William Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County, Virginia Woolf's , Defoe's A Journal of the Plague Year, and Chateaubriand's Atala. This, however, is not necessarily a negative criticism, as it involves the concept of intertextuality.|$|E
