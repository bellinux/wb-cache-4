5|$|In September 1958 VAT, {{together}} with other Finnish companies, participated in the Thessaloniki International <b>Trade</b> <b>Fair.</b> The vehicles shown were one Vanaja VAK lorry and a mid-engined VLK550 bus chassis. Due to the AEC engines the Vanaja's did not raise interest among the potential Greek customers, as relations between the UK and Greece were bad at the time. The lorry was finally sold in Greece but the bus chassis returned to Finland and was sold to a bus operator which built a tourist bus body on it.|$|E

5|$|Lima flourished {{during the}} 17th century {{as the center}} of an {{extensive}} trade network which integrated the Viceroyalty of Peru with the Americas, Europe and the Far East. Its merchants channeled Peruvian silver through the nearby port of Callao and exchanged it for imported goods at the <b>trade</b> <b>fair</b> of Portobelo in modern-day Panama. This practice was sanctioned by law as all trade from the Viceroyalty was required to go through Callao on its way to and from overseas markets. The resulting economic prosperity of the city was reflected in its rapid growth, population expanded from about 25,000 in 1619 to an estimated 80,000 in 1687.|$|E

This article approaches the question with an international comparative study of <b>trade</b> <b>fairs</b> in Asian economies. Generally, consistent with a dynamic interpretation of temporary clusters, <b>trade</b> <b>fairs</b> exhibit a more diverse configuration of participants, being a setting more compatible for knowledge creation, in more developed Asian economies.

5|$|Development of {{the game}} began in 2008 when Dontnod Entertainment was formed. Initially called Adrift, the {{original}} concept {{of the game}} was a world flooded from global warming, with a key gameplay mechanic being the player character using jetskis to navigate a coastal city. Later, the team {{became interested in the}} concept of memory as a central theme and redesigned the game accordingly, although game director Jean-Maxime Moris was reluctant to set the game in Paris since the studio was based there. It was originally developed as a role-playing game with Sony publishing it exclusively for the PlayStation 3, starting full development in February 2010. Following creative disagreements between Dontnod and Sony, and the subsequent cancellation of the project in February 2011 because of budget cuts, the project was presented at the 2011 Gamescom <b>trade</b> <b>fair</b> in the hope that it would garner the attention necessary to secure another publishing deal. Capcom purchased the intellectual property in 2012 and provided funding for the project, reimagining it as an action-adventure game for release on multiple platforms.|$|E
5|$|Invitations {{to enter}} the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, a {{football}} tournament set up to promote industrial trade fairs, were extended to the city hosting the <b>trade</b> <b>fair</b> rather than to clubs. Some cities entered a select team including players {{from more than one}} club, but Aston Villa, the other major club based in the city of Birmingham, rejected the opportunity to field a combined team. Thus Birmingham City became the first English club side to play in European competition when they played their first match in the 1955–58 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup on 15 May 1956. They were also the first English club side to reach a European final, the 1960 Fairs Cup final, in which they met Barcelona. The home leg, a goalless draw, was played on 29 March 1960 and the away leg, which Barcelona won 4–1, some six weeks later. In the semifinal of the 1961 Fairs Cup Birmingham beat Internazionale home and away; no other English club beat them in a competitive match in the San Siro until Arsenal did so in the Champions League over 40 years later.|$|E
25|$|In 1921 a major <b>trade</b> <b>fair</b> was {{established}} in Lwów right {{after the end of}} hostilities there; designed to facilitate new business partnerships from within Poland but also from Greater Romania, Hungary and the Soviet Union among other places. The annual Eastern <b>Trade</b> <b>Fair</b> or the Targi Wschodnie (as it was known in Polish) by 1928 could boast some 1,600 exhibitors, 400 of them being foreign firms. The fair attracted 150,000 visitors that year, with tram connections to the city, customs office and telephone exchange on site. Also in 1928, a similar <b>trade</b> <b>fair</b> was launched in Wilno (now Vilnius, Lithuania) to drum up business in northeastern Poland, reaching out to Lithuania and Latvia. The Northern <b>Trade</b> <b>Fair</b> (Targi Północne) was visited by the staggering 180,000 guests in the first year. It was the biggest annual event locally showcasting textiles, furniture, farm animals, furs, tourist equipment, production machinery and many other commercial products.|$|E
40|$|The Bachelor's {{thesis is}} {{focusing}} on <b>Trade</b> <b>Fairs</b> and Exhibitions as {{an important element in}} competing in global markets. The work describes history and development of <b>Trade</b> <b>Fairs,</b> Exhibitions and how have their main characteristics changed and evolved over the years. It is important to understand this process, because as <b>Trade</b> <b>Fairs</b> and exhibitions changed over the time it has directly affected also the reasons why companies take a part on such an events. Whereas in past companies were coming to <b>Trade</b> <b>Fairs</b> to compete with products and prices, today trend shows that they are looking for propagation of their brand, networking and building of successful image. The outcome of the thesis clearly shows the connection between the competitiveness of the companies and participation on <b>Trade</b> <b>Fairs</b> and Exhibitions.

The attitude behaviour gap in the Czech <b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> market {{was found to be}} in around third of the population, confirming the presence of the gap, which replicated the results of previous research in the field. From people with pro <b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> values who do not buy <b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> products, approximately half is not aware of <b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> existence, indicating that lack of <b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> awareness could be possibly hurting <b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> sales. When analyzing respondents with pro <b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> values who also have <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> awareness, the skepticism towards ability of <b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> movement to fulfill their declared goals and high quality perception of <b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> products {{turned out to be the}} strongest and statistically significant predictors of whether one buys <b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> or not. Focus on raising awareness about <b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> existence, improving quality perception and decreasing skepticism towards <b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> conversion is suggested for <b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> marketers for helping to convert people with pro <b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> values into <b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> buyers...|$|R
