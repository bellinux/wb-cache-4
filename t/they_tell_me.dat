500|$|The largest {{event of}} Clark's tenure as SACEUR was NATO's {{confrontation}} with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the Kosovo War. On September 22, 1998, the United Nations Security Council introduced Resolution 1199 calling {{for an end to}} hostilities in Kosovo, and Richard Holbrooke again tried to negotiate a peace. This process came to an unsuccessful end, however, following the Račak massacre. Then U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright tried to force Yugoslavia into allowing separation of Kosovo with the Rambouillet Agreement, which Yugoslavia refused. Clark was at the Rambouillet talks and tried to convince Yugoslavian president Slobodan Milošević by telling him [...] "there's an activation order. And if <b>they</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> to bomb you, I'm going to bomb you good."

2500|$|Demetriade {{continued}} to play the unconventional poet, well-integrated in {{the atmosphere of the}} era's literary cafes. He embraced the peculiar lifestyle of literary bohemia.

The younger Symbolist Mihail Cruceanu, who met Demetriade in Macedonski's salon in 1905, recalls him as a [...] "Mefisto", who readily imparted his erotic escapades with the Literatorul crowd. He notes: [...] "We the young ones we were looking up to him with much curiosity and sympathy, as he appeared to us as an elegant and fortunate satyr whose astuteness we could never match. But seeing as we were fatigued by the stories' emotionalism, we left for home at midnight, leaving him alone with his complete menu, to consume till dawn. Or so <b>they</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> since I, the aspiring poet, always went to bed before that time." ...|$|E
