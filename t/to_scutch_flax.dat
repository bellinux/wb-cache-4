40|$|The {{industrial}} production of flax fibers yields two fibrous products: scutched fibers are valuable for their length, fineness and cleanness, while tows are entangled, impure and are low-priced. There {{is a need}} for technical data to compare these two kinds of fibers beyond the difference of appearance, and to assess their potential as composite material reinforcements. In this work, we have compared the properties of <b>scutched</b> <b>flax</b> and flax tows from the same batch. The morphology was first assessed by measuring the length, cleanness and fineness of fiber bundles. The tensile properties of single fibers and of unidirectionally reinforced epoxy composites were then measured. The results show that the morphology of flax tows is different from but close to the morphology of <b>scutched</b> <b>flax.</b> Tow bundles were 15 % shorter than <b>scutched</b> <b>flax</b> bundles and tow bundles were 25 % thicker than <b>scutched</b> <b>flax</b> bundles. The tensile properties of single fibers were in the same range. Tensile properties of the unidirectional composites show a similar evolution of properties versus fiber volume fraction. The use of <b>scutched</b> <b>flax</b> allowed volume fractions of 0. 7 to be achieved while tow volume fraction was limited to 0. 6. Despite the visual and morphological difference between tows and <b>scutched</b> <b>flax</b> both can be good candidates for composite reinforcement in high performance applications...|$|R
50|$|Scutching {{is a step}} in the {{processing}} of cotton or the dressing of flax in preparation for spinning. The scutching process separates the impurities from the raw material, such as the seeds from raw cotton or the straw and woody stem from <b>flax</b> fibers. <b>Scutching</b> can be done by hand or by a machine known as a scutcher. Hand <b>scutching</b> of <b>flax</b> is done with a wooden scutching knife and a small iron scraper. The end products of <b>scutching</b> <b>flax</b> are the long flax fibers, short coarser fibers called tow and waste woody matter called shive.|$|R

50|$|The {{scutching}} knife is scraped {{down with}} a sharp strike against the fibers while they hang vertically. The edge of the knife is scraped along the fibers to pull away pieces of the stalk. This is repeated until all of the stalk has been removed and the flax is smooth and silky. When scutching was done by hand people could <b>scutch</b> up <b>to</b> 15 lb of flax in one day, though the amount depended {{on the quality of}} the flax. Coarser flax, harder flax and poorly retted <b>flax</b> takes longer <b>to</b> <b>scutch.</b> Retting removes the pectins that bind the fibers to the stalk and each other, so under-retted flax is harder to separate from the stalk, and often gets damaged in the scutching process. Over-retting the flax causes the fibers to deteriorate and break.|$|R

The plant was touted nationally as a way to make the prison financially self-sustaining, and to rehabilitate prisoners by giving them something to do and preparing them to work. In 1925, OSP had the largest <b>flax</b> <b>scutching</b> mill in the world, with 175 workers producing 100-150 tons of flax per day.|$|R
40|$|International audienceCultivated {{primarily}} for its seeds, oleaginous flax {{could also be}} valued for the different fractions that can be extracted from the straw. However, as the straws are not harvested with the same technique and care than for the textile <b>flax,</b> the classical <b>scutching</b> technique cannot be used. As a consequence, an “all fibre” device was used to perform {{the separation of the}} different constituents of the oleaginous flax straws. The different fractions were quantified for two retting levels and for two degrees of rewetting of the stems. The physical and mechanical properties of fibres were then evaluated. It appears that the relative amount of fibres extracted from oleaginous flax straw is comparable to the one from textile flax (i. e. 40 % of the stem dry mass), and their tensile properties are situated in {{the lower part of the}} textile flax range. This work shows that the individual fibre length of oleaginous flax (between 3 and 6 cm) is comparable to that of the <b>scutched</b> textile <b>flax</b> fibres. This makes them suitable for the production of carded aligned fibre yarns for technical reinforcement textiles (e. g. composites or geotextiles). These results demonstrate the interest and the potential added value of harvesting the stems for technical fibre applications...|$|R
50|$|The Employment of Children Act 1903, while {{primarily}} {{providing for}} industries outside {{the scope of}} the Factory Act, incidentally secured that children employed as half Acts of timers should not also be employed in other occupations. The Notice of Accidents Act 1906 amended the whole system of notification of accidents, simultaneously in mines, quarries, factories and workshops, and will be set out in following paragraphs. The Factory and Workshop Act 1907 amended the law in respect of laundries by generally applying the provisions of 1901 to trade laundries while granting them choice of new exceptional periods, and by extending the provisions of the act (with certain powers to the Home Office by Orders laid before parliament to allow variations) to institution laundries carried on for charitable or reformatory purposes. The Employment of Women Act 1907 repealed an exemption in the act of 1901 (and earlier acts) relating to employment of women in <b>flax</b> <b>scutch</b> mills, thus bringing this employment under the ordinary provisions as to period of employment.|$|R
40|$|The {{concentrations}} of airborne dust and bacteria were determined in 12 <b>flax</b> <b>scutching</b> mills {{and in two}} milk processing plants in Normandy, France. A total of 308 of 340 flax workers and 111 of 113 milk processors volunteered to answer a respiratory questionnaire. Personal exposure to airborne dust in the scutching mills varied from 22. 2 mg/m 3 to 144 mg/m 3 and areal concentrations from 8. 92 mg/m 3 to 47. 1 mg/m 3. The concentration of Gram negative bacteria ranged from 3970 (colony forming units) cfu/m 3 to 67, 900 cfu/m 3 and that of total bacteria from 12, 900 cfu/m 3 to more than 600, 000 cfu/m 3. In all, 20 % of the flax scutchers were found, {{on the basis of}} the questionnaire, to suffer from persistent cough and 25 % from chronic phlegm production. The corresponding figures among milk processors were 3. 6 % and 4. 5 %. Unexpectedly, only 12. 5 % of the scutchers appeared to suffer from byssinotic symptoms even though they were heavily exposed to airborne dust and bacteria. The low prevalence of byssinosis might be due to self selection of the workforce or a relatively low concentration of the causative agent despite high airborne contamination...|$|R
40|$|Various {{technical}} bottlenecks {{limit the}} production of fibre hemp for textile destinations. The HempSys Project tackled {{most of the problems}} hampering {{the production of}} hemp fibre for textiles in Europe. An innovative production system was researched and developed in which harvesting is carried out at flowering, the stem cut into two portions of approx. 1 m long which are laid on the field in swaths, stem portions kept parallel. Baling and scutching is thereafter carried out with flax machines. The long fibre bundles obtained after scutching are retted with an innovative controlled microbiological process. Materials and Methods. During the project the effect of agrotechnique and biomass processing on fibre yield and quality was assessed at the level of plot trials and laboratory evaluation. In order to validate results at industrial scale large field trials with three plant populations and two harvesting times were set up in Cadriano (BO). Hemp stems cut at 1 meter length and bundled were <b>scutched</b> in a <b>flax</b> plant in Austria. The long fibre bundles obtained were weighed and quality evaluation was carried out. Results and discussion. Pure fibre content analysed at lab level showed a decrease in fibre content from the lower to the upper portions of the stem (58 % of bast fibre was found in the first meter), whil...|$|R
40|$|Based on the {{estimated}} global annual production of biomass (1 x 1011 ton ≈ 2 ZJ), theoretically plants could easily {{substitute for the}} annual 0. 2 ZJ petroleum production. In only one decade, plant biomass could {{in the form of}} cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin renew the 20 ZJ energy stored as conventional crude oil. Although the relatively high cost of both pretreatment and enzymes that catalyze cellulose hydrolysis [one-third of the cost of ethanol production from cellulose] still represents a major barrier to commercialization, cellulosic ethanol production is currently in the pilot plant stage, with more than 30 pilot plants being operated in both North-America and Europe. The process generally consists of a pretreatment step, a hydrolysis and a fermentation step. In these processes lignin is discharged as a byproduct {{that can be used to}} supply the process with energy. It is however generally believed that a successful bioenergy research policy should focus on biorefineries, co-producing transportation fuels, power, heat, added-value chemicals and materials from biomass. In the IWT TETRA [a grant program to stimulate innovation in Flemish companies through technology transfer] project VaLiCel, we have compared several pretreatment, hydrolysis and fermentation conditions using lignocellulosic residues (recycled paper pulp, loams & <b>scutched</b> short <b>flax,</b> wood (dust), grasses and agro-industrial waste) and dedicated energy crops (Miscanthus x giganteus, poplar and willow). The yield of fermentable sugars and ethanol is determined and compared. Ultimately, the aim is to know which lignocellulose waste is suited for complete saccharification to glucose and xylose and yields minor side products that are inhibitory to alcohol fermentation. From our results it is clear that by screening a collection of different biomass feedstocks, evaluating different pretreatment methods, screening a large set of yeast strains and optimizing the préculture and fermentation conditions, it is possible to produce second generation bio-ethanol in an economically viable way. First results of a case study will exemplify a possible integration strategy into existing industrial fuel producing plants. It is expected that the co-production of added-value products will lead to overall economic profitability in an integrated biorefinery process. In casu the valorisation of lignin -as a source for aromatic chemicals- can play a key role in the further development of lignocellulosic biomass conversion processes...|$|R
50|$|Fine {{spinning}} {{produced a}} lot of waste so naturally this was recycled. This waste was the raw material of a condensor spinning mill. It came in three forms, loose staple, unspun rovings and spun thread (hard waste) that had been pirned but rejected. No matter its source {{it had to be}} devilled (broken down) <b>to</b> staple, then <b>scutched</b> and carded in the normal way. After these processes the staple was very short, and the processing of the lap was different - a Derby Doubler was used to mix slivers into sliver lap. A notable feature of the mule was that the rovings weren't on individual bobbins but on a beam. As the fine spinning of cotton contracted so did the need for condensing.|$|R
40|$|Because hemp is a short-day plant, postponing the {{sowing date}} {{might be a}} {{suitable}} strategy to obtain shorter and smaller plants around flowering, when primary fibres are 'ripe' enough to be harvested. Smaller plants can be processed on existing <b>flax</b> <b>scutching</b> and hackling lines and might have fibre characteristics that are desirable for producing high-quality 'long fibres' for yarn spinning. It was investigated whether sowing beyond the normal sowing period in the Netherlands affects the ratio in which fibres and wood are produced, and what proportion of these fibres are long fibres, suitable for long fibre spinning. About 400 stem samples were fractioned into retting losses, wood, tow, and long fibre, and the ratios between fractions were analysed using multiple linear regression analyses. A normal sowing date {{at the end of}} April was compared with a postponed sowing date at the end of May. The total fibre/wood ratio was not affected. More than 95 % of the variance in total fibre was accounted for by the wood weight per stem (55. 5 %), the variety (+ 33. 3 %) and the stem part (+ 6. 5 %). The amount of long fibre per stem mainly depended on the amount of the total fibre per stem (95. 4 % variance was accounted for) and the stem part (+ 2. 0 %). For economic reasons, it could be interesting to grow two successive high-quality hemp crops in one growing season. Therefore, in an additional experiment with one variety, the effect of sowing fibre hemp up to 12 weeks later than normal on {{the quantity and quality of}} the fibres was studied. Postponing the sowing date up to 12 weeks had no important effects on retting losses, the total fibre/wood ratio, and the long fibre/total fibre ratio. It is therefore technically possible to grow two successive hemp crops. Whether this fits well in farming systems and a hemp production chain remains to be studie...|$|R
