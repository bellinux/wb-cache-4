5|$|Stroma {{lacked a}} regular {{connection}} to the mainland until 1879, when the Post Office subsidised a weekly boat service from Huna on <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> <b>and</b> established a post office on the island. However, the volume of mail from Stroma proved so small that the service was grossly uneconomical. By the 1950s, the Post Office was spending 1s. 2d. for each letter worth 2½d. in postage.|$|E

5|$|The 1852, the Isle of Wight Electric Company laid a specially-armoured {{telegraph}} cable {{to link the}} castle with Keyhaven on <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> <b>and</b> Sconce Point on the island; two years later, the Electric Telegraph Company linked the castle to Southampton. Hurst used flags to pass on telegraphic messages to and from shipping entering the Solent.|$|E
5|$|The Scalloway Islands {{are a small}} {{archipelago}} at {{the entrance}} to Weisdale Voe in the South West. The North Isles is the name given to the group including Yell, Unst and Fetlar. There are also numerous islands in Yell Sound between <b>the</b> <b>Mainland</b> <b>and</b> Yell and in St. Magnus Bay to the west, especially near the strait of Swarbacks Minn, but the number and diverse locations of the Shetland islands makes further classification difficult.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} genetically {{discrete}} subpopulations {{have been identified}} across the northern range of the Pacific angelshark. Several subpopulations exist along the coast from Point Conception northward to Alaska. In the Southern California Bight, {{there are at least}} three separate subpopulations off <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> <b>and</b> northern and southern Channel Islands. The subpopulation along the Pacific coast of Baja California are distinct from those in the Gulf of California. These subpopulations have diverged from one another over time because Pacific angelsharks do not undertake long migratory movements outside of their preferred home areas, and deep waters serve as effective geographical barriers to population mixing. Heterozygosity, a measure of genetic diversity, is higher in the Pacific angelshark than in other shark species that have been examined.|$|E

5|$|Balon Greyjoy {{speaks to}} Yara about their {{war against the}} North. Yara {{points out that the}} armies of the North have retaken all of the Ironborn strongholds on <b>the</b> <b>mainland,</b> <b>and</b> pleads with him to end the war. However, Balon refuses and vows to send more troops to stage another {{invasion}} of the North. As Balon heads outside, he encounters his brother, Euron Greyjoy, who has come to overthrow him. Balon attempts to stab Euron, who throws him off a bridge to his death. At Balon's funeral, Yara swears revenge against Balon's killer, but is reminded by her uncle Aeron, a Drowned Priest, that her position as successor depends on the results of the Kingsmoot, a ceremony where the Ironborn elect their new leader.|$|E
5|$|In 1849 {{there were}} just 11 people living on the island {{but it was not}} long before the island farms expanded. In the 1850s gold was {{discovered}} on mainland Australia where crews would abandon their ships, preferring to dig for gold than to risk a life at sea. As a consequence many vessels avoided <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> <b>and</b> Lord Howe Island experienced an increasing trade which peaked between 1855 and 1857. In 1851 about 16 people were living on the island. Vegetable crops now included potatoes, carrots, maize, pumpkin, taro, watermelon – even grapes, passionfruit and coffee. Between 1851 and 1853 there were several aborted proposals by the NSW Government to establish a penal settlement on the island.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the islands}} have a bedrock formed from Old Red Sandstone, which is about 400 million years old, and was laid down in the Devonian period. The islands have good {{agricultural}} qualities and have been continuously inhabited for thousands of years, {{as evidenced by the}} World Heritage Site of the Heart of Neolithic Orkney. The archipelago is exposed to wind and tide, and there are numerous lighthouses as an aid to navigation. The European Marine Energy Centre, which is located at Stromness, is currently testing various wave and tidal energy devices from Billia Croo on <b>the</b> <b>Mainland</b> <b>and</b> Eday. The islands all fall within the Orkney Islands Council area. Most of the larger islands have development trusts that support the local economy.|$|E

5|$|Nara period Buddhism was {{dominated}} by six state-controlled sects. They were introduced from <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> <b>and</b> centred around the ancient capitals in Asuka and Nara. These schools were generally academic in nature, closely connected with the court and represented a doctrine that was {{far removed from the}} daily life of the people. In 804, two Japanese monks Kūkai and Saichō travelled to China; on their return they established Tendai and Shingon Buddhism respectively. Unlike their predecessors both esoteric schools took into account the needs of the common people. Though their origins lay in China, with time they acquired local Japanese traits. Generally the 9th century was a time when Chinese learning thrived in Japan. Authors produced a wide variety of works in Chinese language, including commentaries and treatises on a variety of subjects.|$|E
5|$|Northrop Grumman and Raytheon {{decided in}} 2002 to locate its ground station for National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, the {{successor}} of EOS, to Helsinki, Finland, instead of Svalbard. The reason was lack of {{optical fiber cable}} connection to the archipelago. NSC took initiative to build such a cable in July 2002 and gained interest from NASA, NOAA and Telenor. The cable was financed by the satellite operators paying the same fee for the transmission of data {{as they would have}} to pay for a satellite connection until the cable was paid for. A 40 million United States dollar contract was signed with Tyco International for two cables between Harstad on <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> <b>and</b> Longyearbyen. Construction started in June 2003 and was completed in January 2004.|$|E
5|$|State Route 47 (SR 47) is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of California, {{connecting}} Terminal Island to the mainland in the Los Angeles area. From its south end at I-110 in San Pedro, it heads east across the Vincent Thomas Bridge to the island {{and the end of}} state maintenance. The state highway begins again at the junction with I-710 on Terminal Island, crossing the Schuyler Heim Bridge north to <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> <b>and</b> the second terminus, where SR 103 begins. Signage continues along a locally maintained route, mainly Alameda Street, to the Gardena Freeway (SR 91) in Compton, and an unconstructed alignment follows the same corridor to the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10) near downtown Los Angeles.|$|E

With a topic that centered on the growing social rifts between <b>mainland</b> China <b>and</b> Hong Kong, some viewers found the content in Inbound Troubles offensive to both <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> Chinese <b>and</b> Hong Kong citizens. Complaints varied; some viewers expressed that the content in Inbound Troubles [...] "beautified" [...] <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> Chinese <b>and</b> had malicious portrayals of the Hong Kong tourism industry.

5|$|The LRDG {{returned}} to Yugoslavia in February 1945, operating around Istria and Dalmatia, where Germany still held portions of <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> <b>and</b> certain strategic islands. The Germans had heavily mined the southern Adriatic and {{were attempting to}} cover their shipping by moving only by night, close to shore, and heaving to during the day under camouflage nets. The LRDG was tasked to patrol the coast, find the ships and report their locations {{to the air force}} for bombing. This it did with success. It remained in Yugoslavia {{for the rest of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The Republic of China, {{which then}} governed the mainland, {{had joined the}} Olympic {{movement}} in 1924, when the China National Amateur Athletic Federation was recognized by the IOC as the nation's NOC. China participated in the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles, {{as well as in}} Berlin four years later and the first post-war Olympics at London in 1948. When the communists were successful in the Chinese Civil War and established the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, most NOC members fled the mainland for the island of Taiwan. This left China with two rival NOCs, one on <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> <b>and</b> one on Taiwan, each claiming to represent the whole of China.|$|E
5|$|The city is {{administered}} by Portsmouth City Council, a unitary authority {{which is responsible for}} local affairs. Portsmouth was granted its first charter in 1194. In the early 20th century, the boundaries were extended to include the whole of Portsea Island; they were further extended in 1920 and 1932, taking in areas of <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> <b>and</b> adjacent villages which included Drayton and Farlington. From 1April 1974 it formed the second tier of local government below Hampshire County Council; however, Portsmouth, along with Southampton, became administratively independent of Hampshire with the creation of the unitary authority on 1April 1997. The city is divided into two parliamentary constituencies, Portsmouth South and Portsmouth North, represented in the House of Commons by, respectively, Stephen Morgan and Penny Mordaunt, of the Labour Party and Conservative Members of Parliament.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} home of Clan MacIntyre is likewise {{the subject of}} conjecture. There is general agreement that the clan arose in the Hebrides, the islands west of the Scottish mainland. Some accounts, however, identify Skye as the ancestral home, while another tradition holds Islay {{to have been the}} locale. The story of how the clan made its way to <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> <b>and</b> settled along the shore of Loch Etive in the vicinity of Ben Cruachan is again shrouded in myth and magic. It is said that seeking fresh pastures for their cattle they were initially obstructed by a mountain spirit. After testing their perseverance and courage the spirit instructed them to make their new home where the white cow in their herd should first lie down to rest. This site became known as Glen Noe.|$|E
5|$|The two-storied north-west bastion {{protected}} the castle against attack along the spit from <b>the</b> <b>mainland,</b> <b>and</b> housed the castle's original portcullis {{as well as}} providing accommodation for the garrison. It had three levels of gun positions on its ground floor, first floor and roof, which were adapted in the 19th century to house heavier weapons and shelter riflemen. The bastion links to an external caponier, a covered walkway with rifle loops for close defence, built in 1852. The north-east and south-east bastions are only one storey tall, originally holding two levels of gun positions on the ground floor and roofs, again both adapted to support heavier guns in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Two {{other factors}} {{have often been}} cited in Stroma's depopulation: the {{building}} of the nuclear power station at nearby Dounreay in the 1950s, which created many new jobs on <b>the</b> <b>mainland,</b> <b>and</b> in the same decade the construction of a harbour on Stroma on which many islanders were employed. Although it has been claimed that this gave the islanders the incentive (and the means) to leave, local historian Donald A. Young points out that of islanders who left after 1945, only one went directly from Stroma to Dounreay. Most of the rest either continued fishing or carried on crofting on the mainland, while others found alternative jobs. Some ex-islanders eventually found jobs at Dounreay, but they had already moved to the mainland for work or education.|$|E
