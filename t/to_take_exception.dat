500|$|A {{minority}} of the Constitution's critics, such as Maryland's Luther Martin, continued to oppose ratification. However, Martin's allies, such as New York's John Lansing, Jr., dropped moves to obstruct the Convention's process. They began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>exception</b> to the Constitution [...] "as it was," [...] seeking amendments. Several conventions saw supporters for [...] "amendments before" [...] shift {{to a position of}} [...] "amendments after" [...] for the sake of staying in the Union. The New York Anti-Federalist [...] "circular letter" [...] was sent to each state legislature proposing a second constitutional convention for [...] "amendments before", but it failed in the state legislatures. Ultimately, only North Carolina and Rhode Island waited for amendments from Congress before ratifying.|$|E
500|$|In March 1896 Marthinus Theunis Steyn, {{the young}} lawyer Kruger had {{encountered}} {{on the ship}} to England two decades earlier, became President of the Orange Free State. They quickly won each other's confidence; each man's memoirs would describe the other in glowing terms. Chamberlain began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>exception</b> to the South African Republic's diplomatic actions, such as joining the Geneva Convention, which he said breached Article IV of the London Convention (which forbade extraterritorial dealings except vis-a-vis the Orange Free State). Chamberlain asserted that the Transvaal was still under British suzerainty, a claim Kruger called [...] "nonsensical". Kruger and Steyn concluded a treaty of trade and friendship in Bloemfontein in March 1897, along with a fresh military alliance binding each republic to defend the other's independence. Two months later Sir Alfred Milner became the new High Commissioner and Governor in Cape Town.|$|E
500|$|The King {{wrote of}} the {{incident}} to his brother-in-law, Frederick William III of Prussia, [...] "If each of these seven gentlemen had addressed a letter to me expressing his opinion, I {{would have had no}} cause <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>exception</b> to their conduct. But to call a meeting and publish their opinions even before the Government had received their protest—that is what they have done and that I cannot allow." [...] Ernest received a deputation of Göttingen citizens, who, fearing student unrest, applauded the dismissals. However, he was widely criticised in Europe, especially in Britain. In the House of Commons, MP Colonel Thomas Perronet Thompson proposed to Parliament that if the as-yet-childless Queen Victoria died, making Ernest the British King, Parliament should declare that King Ernest had forfeited all rights to the British Throne by his actions.|$|E

60|$|My best {{thanks are due}} to Mr. Gladstone for his courteous {{withdrawal}} {{of one of the}} statements to which I have thought it needful <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>exception.</b> The familiarity with controversy, to which Mr. Gladstone alludes, will have accustomed him to the misadventures which arise when, as sometimes will happen in the heat of fence, the buttons come off the foils. I trust that any scratch which he may have received will heal as quickly as my own flesh wounds have done.|$|E
60|$|He said {{it as if}} he {{had been}} the Emperor {{reconciling}} himself to all the Hanse towns in one. Master Gottfried could scarce refrain from shrugging his shoulders, and Hausfrau Johanna was exceedingly angry with the petulant pride and insolence of the young noble; but, in effect, all were too much relieved to avoid an absolute quarrel with the fiery lad <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>exception</b> at minor matters. The old burgher was forbearing; Christina, who knew how much her son must have swallowed to bring him to this concession for love of her, thought him a hero worthy of all sacrifices; and peace-making Friedel, by his aunt's side, soon softened even her, by some of the persuasive arguments that old dames love from gracious, graceful, great-nephews.|$|E

5000|$|I {{regard the}} {{question}} of annexation as belonging exclusively to the United States and Texas. They are independent powers competent to contract, and foreign nations {{have no right to}} interfere with them or <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>exceptions</b> <b>to</b> their reunion [...] [...] [...] Our Union is a confederation of independent States, whose policy is peace with each other and all the world. To enlarge its limits is to extend the dominions of peace over additional territories and increasing millions. The world has nothing to fear from military ambition in our Government [...] [...] [...] Foreign powers should therefore look on the annexation of Texas to the United States not as the conquest of a nation seeking to extend her dominions by arms and violence, but as the peaceful acquisition of a territory once her own, but adding another member to our confederation, with the consent of that member, thereby diminishing the chances of war and opening to them new and ever-increasing markets for their products.|$|R

'Not that I suppose Lady Fotheringham means to be spiteful, but Percy hears it all from her, and we {{know very well that}} good ladies in the country have a {{tendency}} to think every one good-for-nothing that lives in London or Paris, especially their relations. That is all nonsense. If Percy goes by gossip, I don't. I go by my own observation, and I see there is nothing at which <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>exception.</b> I watched her and Mr. Gardner together, and I do declare there was nothing but ease and frankness. I am sure he was more inclined to pay that sort of attention to me. He really is very entertaining. I must tell you some of his stories.' ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the paper}} that I have already mentioned, as {{recording}} what, when all was near an end, he took to {{be some of the}} errors of his life, Mr. Gladstone names as one of those errors this refusal in 1855 to join Lord Lansdowne. 'I can hardly suppose,' he says, more than forty years after that time, 'that the eventual failure of the Queen's overture to Lord Lansdowne was due to my refusal; but that refusal undoubtedly constituted one of his difficulties and helped to bring about the result. I have always looked back upon it with pain as a serious and even gross error of judgment. It was, I think, injurious to the public, if it contributed to the substitution as prime minister of Lord Palmerston for Lord Lansdowne,--a personage of greater dignity, and I think a higher level of political principle. There was no defect in Lord Lansdowne sufficient to warrant my refusal. He would not have been a strong or very active prime minister; but the question of the day was the conduct of the war, and I had no right <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>exception</b> to him as a head in connection with this subject. His attitude in domestic policy was the same as Palmerston's, but I think he had a more unprejudiced and liberal mind, though less of motive force in certain directions.' ...|$|E

60|$|The combatants {{now stood}} confronting each other within the lists. A written {{document}} was produced, {{which had been}} prepared, as was said, by consent of both parties, containing a statement of the charge made against Katrington, namely, that of treason, in having betrayed to the enemy for money a castle intrusted to his charge, and his reply. The herald read this document with a loud voice, in order that all the assembly, or as many as possible, might hear it. As {{soon as it was}} read, Katrington began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>exceptions</b> <b>to</b> some passages in it. The Duke of Lancaster, who seemed to preside on the occasion, put an end to his criticisms at once, saying that he had already agreed to the paper, and that now, if he made any difficulty about it, and refused to fight, he should be adjudged guilty of the treason, and should at once be led out to execution.|$|R

Posada charged at Carlson causing a brawl in which both dugouts and bullpens cleared. Carlson and Posada were both ejected and suspended three games.|$|E
50|$|Gall's {{concepts}} on brain localization were revolutionary, {{and caused}} religious leaders and some scientists <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>exception.</b> The Roman Catholic Church considered his theory as contrary to religion.

Still others attempted to discredit Gall because they believed he had not given rightful credit to the theories and scientists who influenced him. Étienne-Jean Georget accused Gall of stealing Charles Bonnet's basic idea of brain localization that he had written about over 60 years earlier.|$|E
50|$|Jeszenszky {{told the}} news agency MTI that the chapter in {{question}} {{was supported by a}} wealth of academic research (a contention disputed by the authors of the protest letter). “Looking at this interpretation with a sober mind will reveal nothing offensive, and leveling accusations of racism is an outrageous slander,” he reportedly declared. “Even a committed Roma rights activist would be unable <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>exception</b> to the way the theme is presented.

50|$|Apologeticus, {{his most}} famous apologetic work, was written in Carthage in the summer or autumn of 197 AD, {{during the reign of}} :Septimius Severus.

5000|$|The Age of Enlightenment had intervened and {{prominent}} thinkers had then attacked {{the logic of}} this fable in particular. In the article on [...] "Fable" [...] in his Dictionnaire Philosophique (1764), Voltaire remarked {{that the man was}} quite right in his method of warming his fingers and cooling his soup, and the satyr was a fool <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>exception.</b> The German philosopher Gotthold Ephraim Lessing asserts in one of his essays on fables that its fault 'lies not in the inaccuracy of the allegory, but that it is an allegory only', perhaps reaching towards the conclusion that the fable had been badly framed around an already existing proverb. 'The man ought really to have acted contradictorily; but in this fable he is only supposed to have done so.' By using the fable to focus on political behaviour, therefore, the writers and artists give it a justification not inherent within its narrative.|$|E
