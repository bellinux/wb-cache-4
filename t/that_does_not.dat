30|$|To {{explore the}} {{robustness}} of the results, we conducted the following post hoc sensitivity analyses: For all outcomes, we excluded trials that used per-protocol analysis, trials published in abstract form, trials <b>that</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> explicitly blind patients and healthcare personnel, trials that administered control formulae containing omega- 3, and trials <b>that</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> administer {{the control group}} a placebo feed. For the mortality outcome, we excluded trials in which eligibility for inclusion was unclear (based on ICU admission), and further explored odds ratio (OR) {{as an alternative to}} RR analysis. For the ICU LOS outcome, we excluded trials <b>that</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> directly report SDs. Lastly for the DMV outcome, we excluded trials <b>that</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> directly report SDs and trials <b>that</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> stratify randomization by mechanical ventilation.|$|R

5|$|According to Hesler and Smith's 1979 {{classification}} {{of the genus}} Lactarius, L.torminosus belongs to subgenus Piperites, section Piperites (in which it is the type species), subsection Piperites.

A 2004 phylogenetic analysis of European Lactarius species concluded that L.torminosus falls into a group that includes L.torminosulus, and that these two species {{are closely related to}} a group that includes L.tesquorum, L.scoticus, and L.pubescens.|$|E

5|$|Although {{far less}} common than other metallo{{proteins}} (e.g. those of zinc and iron), cobaltoproteins are known aside from B12.

Another non-corrin cobalt enzyme is nitrile hydratase, an enzyme in bacteria that metabolize nitriles.|$|E

40|$|Aiming {{to study}} the {{parasitic}} capacity of Apanteles militaris through lifetime on Mythimna unipuncta, the following parameters were analyzed for each day of parasitism: number of cocoons per host: number of larvae <b>that</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> form cocoon: number of larvae <b>that</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> emerge from the host; sex-ratio; adult emergence rate: number of parasitized, dead ar pupated armyworm. Maximum female longevity was 16 days. The number of cocoons per host decreased for older parasitoid females. The age of the females <b>did</b> <b>not</b> significantly affect the following parameters: the number of larvae <b>that</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> form cocoon, the number of larvae <b>that</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> emerge from the host, the sex-ratio and adult emergence.
