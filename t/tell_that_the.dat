25|$|Treatment for {{meconium}} impaction typically {{involves the}} use of enemas, although persistent cases may require mineral oil or IV fluids. It is possible to <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> meconium has passed when the foal begins to produce a softer, more yellow manure. Although meconium impactions rarely cause perforation, and are usually not life-threatening, foals are at risk of dehydration and may not get adequate levels of IgG due to decreased suckling and not enough ingestion of colostrum. Additionally, the foals will eventually bloat, and will require surgical intervention. Surgery in a foal can be especially risky due to immature immune system and low levels of ingested colostrum.|$|E
25|$|Ancient exegetes, {{such as the}} Midrash and the Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan, <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> motive {{involved}} a desire for the most beautiful woman. According to Midrashic tradition, Cain and Abel each had twin sisters; each was to marry the other's. The Midrash states that Abel's promised wife, Aclima, was more beautiful. Since Cain would not consent to this arrangement, Adam suggested seeking God's blessing {{by means of a}} sacrifice. Whoever God blessed would marry Aclima. When God openly rejected Cain's sacrifice, Cain slew his brother in a fit of jealousy and anger. Analysts have described Cain's relationship to his sister as being incestuous.|$|E

500|$|At 1:45am Catherine Eddowes' {{mutilated}} {{body was}} found by PC Edward Watkins at the south-west corner of Mitre Square, in the City of London, about 12 minutes walk from Berner Street. She had been killed less than 10 minutes earlier by a slash to the throat {{from left to right}} with a sharp, pointed knife at least 6inches (15cm) long. Her face and abdomen were mutilated, and her intestines were drawn out over the right shoulder with a detached length between her torso and left arm. Her left kidney and most of her uterus were removed. The Eddowes inquest was opened on 4 October by Samuel F. Langham, coroner for the City of London. The examining pathologist, Dr Frederick Gordon Brown, believed the perpetrator [...] "had considerable knowledge of the position of the organs" [...] and from the position of the wounds on the body he could <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> murderer had knelt {{to the right of the}} body, and worked alone. However, the first doctor at the scene, local surgeon Dr George William Sequeira, disputed that the killer possessed anatomical skill or sought particular organs. His view was shared by City medical officer William Sedgwick Saunders, who was also present at the autopsy. Because of this murder's location, the City of London Police under Detective Inspector James McWilliam were brought into the enquiry.|$|E
500|$|Traveling {{salesman}} Todd Packer (David Koechner) {{comes to}} Dunder Mifflin {{looking for a}} desk job in the office. However, most of the office does {{not want him to}} work there due to his previous behavior, and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) in particular is horrified at the idea. Holly Flax (Amy Ryan) gives him a job as a salesman, forcing Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) to leave his desk and move to the annex. Todd repeatedly offends everybody with his jokes, especially Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), although Kevin pretends to play along. Only Michael Scott (Steve Carell), Packer's longtime friend, is not offended by Todd. Holly, who was at first excited to have Todd in the office per Michael's recommendations, discovers how insensitive Todd is and asks Michael to get him under control. Michael and Todd have coffee in the lobby, where Todd says {{he wants to be a}} better person. Michael gets Todd to apologize, but everyone can <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> apologies are insincere. Dwight and Jim scheme to get rid of Todd. They call him, pretending to be corporate offering him a job in Tallahassee, Florida, a job which Todd readily accepts. Michael overhears the call and goes to tell Todd that Dwight and Jim have tricked him. Before he has a chance, however, Todd insults Holly, and Michael decides to keep Dwight and Jim's scheme a secret and allow Todd to take the [...] "job" [...] in Florida. As Michael and Holly witness Todd drive away from the view in his office, Michael admits that Packer is [...] "an ass" [...] before they embrace.|$|E
500|$|Tamil works {{transform}} the terrible Kapali form of Shiva {{to a more}} lovable form. South Indian devotional literature portrays Bhikshatana in the Deodar Forest of the sages, but the Tevaram by the Nayanar poet-saints also describes rural women following him and calling out to him. Several poet-saints describe the sensuous nature of Bhikshatana and the love-sick emotions {{of the women who}} came to give him alms. However, the references to Shiva seeking alms had reduced to only three or four by the time of Manikkavacakar (9th century AD). The poems of Campantar, Appar, and Cuntarar focus on two forms of Shiva: Nataraja and Bhikshatana. The 7th-century Nayanar saint Campantar mentions that Bhikshatana wanders from door to door asking for alms with the beggar's call [...] "Ladies, give me alms" [...] and places his verses on the lips of women, who become enamoured of Bhikshatana. In a verse, Campantar rhetorically asks why the giver of all things and one who ends all troubles of devotees—Shiva—is wandering begging for food with a disgusting white skull. In another verse a woman comments on his strange appearance and describes how she is frightened by the serpent that wraps around his body when she approaches to give him alms. Another 7th-century Nayanar saint, Appar, talks about the handsome beggar Shiva, seducer of married women. He speaks of women allured by Bhikshatana's speech and his glance. The women <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> handsome beggar wearing tiger-skin and smeared with ash had come riding a white bull and holding an axe, and used a skull as his begging bowl. Although he begged for alms, he would not accept any from the woman, deeming them [...] "petty". He did however warn the women of deceptions and cunning. Appar adds a strong erotic element in most of his verses, where the women directly desire physical contact with Bhikshatana. A woman in Appar's poetry sings: ...|$|E

2500|$|Japanese {{names have}} {{distinct}} differences from Chinese names through {{the selection of}} characters in a name and pronunciation. A Japanese person can distinguish a Japanese name from a Chinese name by looking at it. Akie Tomozawa, author of [...] "Japan's Hidden Bilinguals: The Languages of 'War Orphans' and Their Families After Repatriation From China," [...] {{said that this was}} equivalent to how [...] "Europeans can easily <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> name 'Smith' is English and 'Schmidt' is German or 'Victor' is English or French and 'Vittorio' is Italian".|$|E
2500|$|Most 3-4-year olds {{are able}} to break simple consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) syllables up into their {{constituents}} (onset and rime). The onset of a syllable consists of all the consonants preceding the syllable’s vowel, and the rime {{is made up of}} the vowel and all following consonants. For example, the onset in the word ‘dog’ is /d/ and the rime is /og/. Children at 3–4 years of age were able to <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> nonwords /fol/ and /fir/ would be liked by a puppet whose favorite sound is /f/. 4-year olds are less successful at this task if the onset of the syllable contains a consonant cluster, such as /fr/ or /fl/.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{were mostly}} unified {{in the opinion}} that the game paid fan service to those who follow the series.

[...] Those stories also <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> female leader of the raid {{was a member of}} the Tsaagweidí clan. [...] In fact, the Puget Sound Herald of Steilacoom published an article fifteen months after Ebey's assassination stating the Kake and Stikine nations, [...] "numbering a couple hundred," [...] were responsible for the [...] "cold blooded murder." [...] However, it was never known which particular tribe perpetrated the death and beheading of Colonel Ebey.|$|E
2500|$|Though the admonition against [...] "bigness for bigness' sake" [...] {{was always}} there, the demand to serve campuses {{wherever}} {{they might be}} was equally loud. In 1909, for example (after the Grand Council had earlier refused to put a chapter on the West Coast because of the distance involved and because it feared such a chapter would be denied the visits and services of a nearby headquarters), the Fraternity spanned the continent. The Ridge Road Club of the University of California, Berkeley became Omega Chapter—fittingly utilizing the last letter of the Greek alphabet and preparing {{the way for the}} first of the Deuteron or second-series units.

In a retrospective review of the game, Kotaku editor Luke Plunkett praised the game's soundtrack and called the multiplayer [...] "excellent." [...] Plunkett cited {{the release of the}} visually superior Quake a year earlier and Half-Life not long after as factors that led to the game fading into obscurity for most players.
