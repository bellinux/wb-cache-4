40|$|Pushover {{analysis}} is frequently utilized to predict nonlinear behavior of structural systems. One important factor, which considerably influences {{the results of}} pushover analysis, is the pattern of distribution of lateral loads along the height of struc-tures. In this paper, five 4 - to 13 -story SPSW frames are de-signed according to the AISC- 341 code. The frames are then analyzed under two lateral loading patterns recommended by FEMA- 356. The first load distribution pattern {{is proportional to the}} shape of the fundamental mode, called the <b>triangular</b> <b>loading</b> pattern. The second pattern is a uniform distribution in proportion to the total mass of each story level.

The model developed is based on Terzaghi's (1943) calculation of the stresses in a trapdoor experiment. In the present paper, it is assumed that the deformation of a geosynthetic reinforcement should not be simulated with one trapdoor, but with a series of trapdoors. For a 2 D situation this results in an inverse <b>triangular</b> <b>load</b> distribution on the GR. This has also been found in experiments.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the effect of}} axle load {{spreading}} through ballast {{and the effect of}} support stiffness has been investigated on short span railway bridges. Two types of bridges, simply supported bridges and bridges with integrated backwalls, have been modeled with 2 D beam elements. When analyzing the load spreading effect, two types of load shapes have been considered. The first one is the load shape proposed in Eurocode where the axle load is modeled with three point loads where 50 % of the axle load acts on the sleeper located underneath the wheel and 25 % on the two adjacent sleepers, respectively. Therefrom the loads are further distributed through the sleepers and the ballast. The second load shape that has been studied is a <b>triangular</b> <b>load</b> shape. These two load shapes have been modeled both with different numbers of point loads and as distributed line loads to see how the dynamic response of the bridges is affected and thereby find what level of accuracy that is required to capture the full effect of the load spreading. For the bridges with integrated backwalls the supports were also modeled as springs with varying stiffness to see how the dynamic response was affected. The response was measured in terms of vertical acceleration and bending moment. From the simulations the conclusion can be drawn that the <b>triangular</b> <b>load</b> shape gives significantly lower bridge responses than the Eurocode load shape. It is further found that modeling the axle loads with point loads can give spurious acceleration peaks, which in the case of bridges with integrated backwalls often are critical. For these bridges it is necessary to enhance the accuracy of the load spread, either by increasing the number of point loads or using a distributed line load. From the spring support simulations, {{it can be seen that}} support stiffness has great influence on the dynamic response of bridges with integrated backwalls. For certain values the response is increased, whereas for other values a large reduction is obtained...|$|E

In POA, inverted triangular lateral load and uniform lateral load patterns were used to produce a base shear–drift curve. In IDA, seven far-field and seven near-field ground motion records were selected to establish the base shear–drift relationship. Structural response and damage measures were examined by the performance-based seismic design limit states. Vision 2000 proposed four performance states, namely, fully operational, operational, life safety (LS), and near collapse. The {{results showed that the}} designed structures have low stiffness because all MRCFs failed to meet the LS limit state. The base shear–drift relationship produced a higher demand in IDA than in POA.

This study investigates the different factors affecting the resilient modulus of hot mix asphalt. A fractional factorial design of experiment was carried out to investigate seven factors each factor was studied at two levels. These factors are: the maximum nominal aggregate size, specimen diameter and thickness, the load pulse form and duration, preset strain level and the compaction method. Two types of hot mix asphalts with different maximum aggregate sizes (10 mm and 14 mm) were studied. Gyratory and Marshall compaction methods were used to prepare the specimens.

This study attempts to examine how the different factors interrelate to affect the resilient modulus. It was found that the most significant factor affecting the resilient modulus value is the maximum nominal aggregate size followed by the load duration period, specimen thickness, specimen diameter, compaction method and strain level, and then the interaction between specimen diameter and thickness, the interaction between aggregate size and thickness, aggregate size and compaction method.

40|$|AbstractThe {{response}} of structural components {{subjected to a}} stepped <b>triangular</b> blast <b>loading</b> had {{been the subject of}} a great deal of research. Much of these researches had been concentrated on the {{response of}} plates to impulsive loads.

The aim of this work is to determine the dynamic response of stiffened orthotropic plates to a stepped trianggular blast loading and to determine the effect of stiffeners configuration and blast loading duration on the plate failure. The natural frequencies of the orthotropic plate were solved from two transcendental equations, while the eigen functions of the system are solved using the Modified Bolotin Method (MBM). The stepped traingular blast loading is further integrated using the Duhamel integration method to find the total dynamic response of the system.

This paper further validates this model with measurements from seven full-scale tests and four series of scaled model experiments. Most of these measurements have been reported earlier in the literature. The new model describes arching with the “Concentric Arching model” (CA model). This model is an extension of the single arch model of Hewlett and Randolph (1988) and the multi-scale model of Zaeske (2001), which is also described in Kempfert et al. (2004). For load-deflection behaviour, Van Eekelen et al. (2012 a,b, 2013) proposed the use of a net load distribution that is inverse triangular instead of uniform or triangular. These authors also proposed the inclusion of all the subsoil support beneath the GR in the calculations. On the basis of comparisons between the measurements and calculations, it is concluded that the CA model matches the measurements better than the models of Zaeske or Hewlett and Randolph. Where there is no subsoil support, or almost no subsoil support, the inverse <b>triangular</b> <b>load</b> distribution on the GR strips between adjacent piles gives the best match with the measurements.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a generalization of the thin-layer method to three dimensions, {{a tool that}} allows assessing layered media subjected to loads eliciting nonsymmetrical wave fields. It {{is based on a}} formulation that fully couples the three components of motion, and allows finding effective solutions to either stationary or moving loads of arbitrary shape that act on (or within) horizontally layered media. In particular, it is an ideal tool for finding analytical solutions to the so-called 2. 5 D problem, which entails loads with arbitrary distribution in one horizontal coordinate direction together with a harmonic (sinusoidal) variation in the other. Inasmuch as the Green's functions for the latter case are found explicitly in the spatial domain without recourse to numerical integration, it allows using such functions — most likely {{in the context of the}} boundary element method — as fundamental solutions for problems of soil–structure interaction where the structure is invariant in one horizontal direction, such as a railroad track resting on an embankment. The method entails solving at each frequency of interest two uncoupled eigenvalue problems for generalized SH and SVP waves (i. e. horizontally and vertically polarized shear and pressure waves), after which the fundamental solutions are obtained in closed-form at any desired point in space. Inasmuch as the proposed technique dispenses with at least one of the two inverse Fourier transforms into the spatial domain, in due time the methodology presented is likely to become the preferred tool for a wide class of problems. The technique is first benchmarked against the known solution for a point load and then applied to a rectangular and <b>triangular</b> <b>load</b> distribution.

To figure out the deformation and failure behaviors of rocks under varying stress level, a series of uniaxial compression tests on Kimachi sandstone was carried out. In the experiments, the constant loading rate of 1 × 10 - 5 s- 1 for 50 s and five triangular waves consisting of 11 × 10 - 5 s- 1 and - 9 × 10 - 5 s- 1 for 50 s, were alternately applied to 20 specimens.

This extreme degree of digitigrady provides an excellent opportunity for the study of phalangeal adaptation towards fast, sustained bipedal locomotion. Data were gathered in a semi-natural setting with hand-raised, cooperative specimens. Dynamic pressure distribution, centre of pressure (CoP) trajectory and the positional inter-relationship of the toes during stance phase were investigated using pedobarography. Walking and running trials shared a J-shaped CoP trajectory with greater localization of CoP origin as speed increased. Slight variations of 4 th toe position in walking affect CoP origin and modulation of 4 th toe pressure on the substrate allows correction of balance, primarily at the beginning of stance phase at lower speeds. Load distribution patterns differed significantly between slow and fast trials. In walking, the 3 rd and particularly the 4 th toe exhibited notable variation in load distribution with minor claw participation only at push-off. Running trials yielded a distinctly <b>triangular</b> <b>load</b> distribution pattern defined by the 4 th toe tip, the proximal part of the 3 rd toe and the claw tip, with the sharp point of the claw providing an essential traction element at push-off. Consistency of CoP trajectory and load distribution at higher speeds arises from dynamic stability effects and may also reflect stringent limitations to degrees of freedom in hindlimb joint articulation that contribute to locomotor efficiency.

Steel-plate composite (SC) walls are {{a viable alternative to}} RC for protecting the infrastructure against explosive threats. SC structures consist of two steel faceplates with plain concrete core between them. The steel faceplates are anchored to the concrete using stud anchors and connected to each other using tie bars. SC structures provide mass from the concrete infill and ductility from the continuous external steel faceplates. This dissertation presents findings and recommendations from experimental and analytical investigations of the performance of SC walls subjected to far-field blast loads. ^ Twelve SC panels were tested in the U.

These panels varied flexure and shear reinforcement ratios, tie bar spacing, and steel faceplate strength. Results from the physical experiments were used to benchmark numerical models which were then used to expand the experimental database and perform a series of parametric studies investigating the influence of blast load, geometric, material, and analysis parameters. ^ Two benchmarked models were developed: (1) detailed finite element (FE) models using the non-linear FE code LS-DYNA, and (2) idealized single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) models using experimentally validated bilinear strain hardening static resistance functions and exponential decay or <b>triangular</b> <b>load</b> pulse forcing functions.

Creep resistance was further improved via solid solution strengthening of the channels by enrichment of the alloying elements Co, Cr, Re, and W. Specimens having different orientations with respect to the crystallographic system and the growth direction were tested in LCF until fracture under load control with <b>triangular</b> <b>load</b> pattern and a load ratio of about 0. 62 to 0. 65 in tension. Fractography revealed that cracks initiated at interdendritic pores, either in the volume or at the surface. On length sections two crack propagation paths were identified (1) perpendicular to the load direction within the γ-channels (see Figure 1) or (2) along { 111 }-slip planes (see Figure 2). In both cases intermetallic phases containing refractory alloying elements occurred, decorating the crack paths and slip planes, respectively. Such intermetallic phases, presumably topologically closed packed (TCP) phases, were further only observed close to the surface within a thin seam of 20 µm. Since in the specimen’s remaining volume no such phases appeared, it is assumed that their localized formation is linked to local stress-/strain-concentrations at pores, crack tips, and shear bands. While TCP formation is associated with depletion of solid solution hardening elements of the γ-phase, having negative influence on creep properties if occurring dispersed in the volume, its influence on fatigue properties appears to be ambiguous. It seems that localized formation of TCP-phases may reduce the crack propagation velocity either of cracks along γ-channels by causing crack tip unloading and crack path deviations or of cracks along slip planes by inhibiting further shear deformation. The effects of the observed microstructural mechanisms will be discussed with respect to LCF life...|$|E
40|$|A basal {{reinforced}} piled embankment {{consists of}} a reinforced embankment on a pile foundation. The reinforcement consists {{of one or more}} horizontal layers of geosynthetic reinforcement (GR) installed {{at the base of the}} embankment. The design of the GR is the subject of this thesis. A basal reinforced piled embankment can be used for the construction of a road or a railway when a traditional construction method would require too much construction time, affect vulnerable objects nearby or give too much residual settlement, making frequent maintenance necessary. The GR strain needs to be calculated to design the GR. Multiplying this GR strain by the GR stiffness gives the tensile force, which needs to be smaller than the long-term GR tensile strength. The GR strain is calculated in two steps. Calculation step 1 divides the load – the weight of the embankment fill, road construction and traffic load – into two load parts. One part (load part A) is transferred to the piles directly. This part is relatively large because a load tends to be transferred to the stiffer parts of a construction. This mechanism is known as ‘arching’. The second, residual load part (B+C) rests on the GR (B) and the underlying subsoil (C). Calculation step 2 determines the GR strain on the basis of the result of step 1. Only the GR strips between each pair of adjacent piles are considered: they are loaded by B+C and may or may not be supported by the subsoil. The GR strain can be calculated if the distribution of load part B+C on the GR strip, the amount of subsoil support and the GR stiffness are known. An implicit result of this calculation step is the further division of load part B+C into parts B and C. Several methods for the GR design are available, all with their own models for calculation steps 1 and 2. The methods give results that differ immensely. The Dutch CUR 226 (2010) and the German EBGEO (2010) adopted Zaeske’s method (2001). However, measurements that were published later (Van Duijnen et al., 2010; Van Eekelen et al., 2015 a) showed that this method could be calculating much higher GR strains than those measured in practice, leading to heavier and more expensive designs than necessary. The objective of the present study was to establish a clearer picture of load distribution in a basal reinforced piled embankment and, on that basis, to develop and validate an analytical design model for the geosynthetic reinforcement in a piled embankment. The results were described in five papers published in the international scientific journal ‘Geotextiles and Geomembranes’. Those journal papers can be found in Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5 and Appendix A of this thesis (Van Eekelen et al., 2012 a, 2012 b, 2013, 2015 a and 2011 respectively). Chapter 2 presents a series of twelve 3 D experiments that were carried out at the Deltares laboratory. The scaled model tests were carried out under high surcharge loads to achieve stress situations comparable with those in practice. A unique feature of these tests was that load parts A, B and C could be measured separately, making it possible to compare the measurements with calculation steps 1 and 2 separately. In these tests (static load, laboratory scale), smooth relationships were obtained between the net load on the fill (surcharge load minus subsoil support) and several measured parameters such as load distribution and deformation. Consolidation of the subsoil resulted in an increase in arching (more A) and more tensile force in the GR (more B and more GR strain). The measured response to consolidation depends on the fill’s friction angle. A higher friction angle results in more arching during consolidation. One of the major conclusions based on the test series was that the load on a GR strip is approximately distributed as an inverse triangle, with the lowest pressure in the centre and higher pressure close to the piles. This conclusion was the basis for the remainder of this doctorate study and the development of the new calculation model. Chapter 3 considers calculation step 2. This chapter starts by comparing the measurements in the experiments with the calculation results of step 2 of the Zaeske (2001) model, which uses a <b>triangular</b> <b>load</b> distribution on the GR strip and considers the support of the subsoil underneath the GR strip only. It was found that Zaeske’s model calculates GR strains that are larger than the measured GR strains (approximately a factor of two for GR strains larger than 1 %). Chapter 3 continues with the suggestion of two modifications to Zaeske’s step 2. Firstly, the load distribution is changed from a triangular to an inverse <b>triangular</b> <b>load</b> distribution. Secondly, the subsoil support is extended from the support by the subsoil underneath the GR strip to the subsoil underneath the entire GR between the piles. The new step 2 model with these modifications produces a much better fit with field measurements than Zaeske’s model. Chapter 4 considers calculation step 1, the arching. Additional tests were conducted for this purpose, varying factors such as the fill height. This chapter gives an overview of the existing arching models and introduces a new model. This Concentric Arches model (CA model) is an adaptation and extension of the models of Hewlett and Randolph (1988), and Zaeske (2001), which have been adopted in several European design guidelines. Some countries use piled embankments without GR. Introducing GR changes the load distribution considerably. A major part of the load is then exerted on the piles and the residual load is mainly exerted on the GR strips between the piles, with the load being distributed approximately as an inverse triangle. Chapter 4 explains the development of the load distribution as a result of continuing GR deflection; new small arches grow within the older larger ones. Smaller arches exert less load on their subsurface. This idea is related to the concentric arches of the new model, which gives an almost perfect description of the observed load distribution in the limit state situation. Furthermore, the new model describes the influence of the fill strength and embankment height correctly. Chapter 5 compares the existing, and the newly introduced, design models with measurements from seven full-scale projects and four series of scaled model experiments. Two of these seven field projects were conducted in the Netherlands and they were carried out in part for this doctorate research. One of the four experimental series – the one presented in Chapters 2 and 4 – was conducted specifically for the present research. The other measurements were reported earlier in the literature. The calculations were carried out using mean, best-guess values for the material properties. The calculation results from the CA model match the measurements much better than the results of the arching models of Hewlett and Randolph (1988), and of Zaeske (2001). The results of the CA model are also the closest match with the results of the 3 D numerical calculations, as described in Van der Peet and Van Eekelen (2014). These authors also show that the new CA model responds better to changes in the fill friction angle than any of the other models considered. When there is no subsoil support, or almost no subsoil support, the inverse <b>triangular</b> <b>load</b> distribution on the GR strips between adjacent piles gives the best match with the measurements. When there is significant subsoil support, the load distribution is approximately uniform. This difference between the situation with or without subsoil support is understandable when one considers that most load is attracted to the construction parts that move least. In the cases with limited subsoil support, the load distribution that gives the minimum GR strain should be used to find the best match with the measurements. The GR strain calculated with Zaeske’s model is on average 2. 46 times the measured GR strain. The GR strain calculated with the new model is on average 1. 06 times the measured GR strain. The calculated GR strain is therefore almost a perfect match with the measured GR strain. The new Dutch CUR 226 (2015) has therefore adopted the model proposed in this thesis.

40|$|AbstractIncreasing {{population}} {{in recent decades}} has made the necessity of quick low cost construction unavoidable. Meanwhile the use of prefabricated concrete frame with prefabricated concrete shear walls due to better quality of performance and reduction of manufacturing time is a good option for public multiple floor buildings. These structures in addition to resistance to seismic loads have more flexibility in methods of construction. There is little information about the exact behavior of prefabricated concrete frame with shear walls under earthquake and dynamic loads. Hence much {{research has been done}} by various researchers on the seismic behavior of these structures in the form of experimental and analytical models. Today, the main section of the seismic design of buildings is done based on equivalent static force method and calculating earthquake force of design from earthquake linear spectrum by applying a reduction coefficient called behavior coefficient of structure that embrace philosophy of design. So the necessity of determining behavior coefficient with respect to its importance in seismic design of structures seems essential. The behavior coefficient of structure is a coefficient that includes inflexible function of structure and indicates strength and hidden ductility of structure in inflexible stage. In this study various types of pre-fabricated concrete frames together with pre-fabricated 4 and 8 -storey shear walls with 1 and 3 bays are studied. The effect of two kinds of uniform and <b>triangular</b> <b>loading</b> on behavior factor has also been taken into consideration. Non-linear static analysis method (Push-over) has been used {{in order to determine the}} behavior factor. On the whole, the results have shown that by increasing the bays and building storeys the structural behavior coefficient was increased...|$|R

Human lumbar spine {{tolerance}} to the compressive impact loading is less when compared to its tolerance to the perpendicular dynamic load. The dynamic response of the functional spinal unit in compressive loading is governed by the viscoelastic behavior of the IVD (Intervertebral disc). The axial bulge of the disc {{is the result of}} viscoelastic nature of the nucleus which tends to swell under high loading rate. This characteristic causes the end-plate to bow into the cancellous bone as it is supported by the strong cortical bone on its periphery. The end-plate is one of the,important elements in the functional spinal unit if failed results disc material to progress into the vertebral body beneath it. This paper quantifies the axial bulge of the end-plate under dynamic compressive load using Finite Element Method. A simple validated axis symmetry FE model is employed to identify the most vulnerable lumbar spine level using the sensitivity analysis. This is followed by the development of more detailed FE model with viscoelastic modeling of the nucleus and the annulus. The dynamic load is applied on the superior vertebral body which follows <b>triangular</b> <b>loading</b> profile with 50 ms rise time. The axial bulge is quantified {{at the center of the}} disc as this is the location of maximum deflection and local stress in the end-plate. The ratio of axial bulge and the total FSU deflection is plotted against magnitude of load applied to gain insight regarding the relation between load magnitude and axial bulge. This study will complement the research on end-plate fracture mechanism and its role in causing the burst fracture based on the magnitude of load...|$|R
