Finn Jones, who was cast concurrently in the leading role for the upcoming television series Marvel's Iron Fist, spoke about his departure saying, [...] "I had been on Thrones for six years. It was yearly employment. Now I was at a crossroads and I had {{to think of what}} the future is. I was very blessed that something like this has come along at the right moment," [...] referring to Iron Fist. Eugene Simon also spoke about his learning of his departure, saying that the showrunners promised a [...] "huge scene" [...] for his character in the season finale, with Simon responding, [...] "for everything that you've done for the last six years, thank you. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> way to go.

2500|$|GameSpy's Kevin Murphy, too, {{criticized the}} PS2 version's limited {{use of the}} sword: [...] "This {{ultimately}} hurts the game, as it's really fun hacking with the sword." [...] He also disliked the combat system; [...] "Players are just pushing the right analog stick around and don't have any control over the actual moves Blade uses, just {{the direction of his}} attack. While <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> control scheme when enemies surround you, it's just not as good as letting the player decide to punch, kick, or throw." [...] He concluded [...] "Blade II isn't all bad. It has its moments and fans of the character will be content, but not overjoyed with the title. Hardcore and casual gamers alike, however, will tire of it very quickly." [...] Steve Steinberg wrote of the Xbox version's combat system, [...] "it probably made more sense in theory than it does in actual application," [...] calling it [...] "the stick version of button-mashing." [...] He also criticized the AI, saying: [...] "The game would have been far better with fewer, but more intelligent, enemies. As it is, it's just you against wave after wave of poorly developed enemies." [...] He concluded, [...] "Ultimately, Blade II plays more like a platformer for adults than like an action title [...] Clean up some of the rough language, give Blade a big, bulbous, cutesy head, and replace the millions of vampires per level with an equal number of collectible trinkets and you'll have something the Nintendo crowd can tackle when they're done with the latest Mario romp." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Norwood {{introduced}} her rap alter ego Bran'Nu on Timbaland's album Shock Value II (2009), {{the result of}} artistic experimentation with the musician, who had tapped her for her rhyming ability after seeing a video on YouTube that Norwood had uploaded and showed her rapping freestyle. Norwood, who had initially thought of rapping as a hobby and fun for friends, felt encouraged by Timbaland to write and perform her own verses on at least three tracks for his album, two of which eventually {{made it to the}} track lisiting. In December 2009, the producer revealed his intentions to reteam with her on her next project, producing the bulk of an album that he envisioned to be “half singing, half rapping”. Norwood confirmed his idea in an interview she held at the release party of Shock Value II: [...] "What I'm doing on the [...] album is a little bit different than what everybody knows me for. Timbaland endorsed that [...] He really gave me a shot to be different and be versatile. I can't thank him enough for that. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> opportunity." [...] Though Norwood went on to record several other rap songs the following months and hoped it would eventually lead to a signing with Timbaland's Mosley Music Group, plans for hip hop-oriented album under his imprint were eventually abandoned as the singer felt the sound would not aim at her core audience. Approached on the subject, she later dismissed the idea of recording a rap album, stating that “it was a hobby. I was convinced to do it professionally, which I never should have listened to that advice.” ...|$|E
