5|$|Between 1906 and 1908, the Pentecostal message {{had spread}} among Christian and Missionary Alliance (CMA) churches and conferences.

5|$|Bryan {{had hoped}} to sweep the rural vote and make inroads on urban labor, {{but he was not}} successful. McKinley became the first Republican {{candidate}} to win in New York City, and won in its rival city of Brooklyn as well. He lost only one city with a population of over 45,000 in <b>the</b> <b>Midwest,</b> <b>and</b> won many rural counties in crucial states. Although Bryan won all states south of Kentucky and from Texas east, McKinley won most urban centers there.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{sought to}} promote a form of nativist, Protestant nationalism. In {{addition}} to his white supremacist ideology, he fiercely condemned Catholicism, unionism, and communism, which were associated with recent immigrants from eastern and southern Europe. He argued that Jews formed a non-American culture and resisted assimilation, although he denied being an anti-Semite. Historians credit Evans with refocusing the Klan on political activities and recruiting outside the Southern United States; the Klan grew most in <b>the</b> <b>Midwest</b> <b>and</b> industrial cities. However, they note that the political influence and membership gains he sought were transitory. Some commentators argue that Evans was more focused on money and power than any particular ideology.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the large}} number of Latter Day Saint churches and their differing backgrounds, categorizing them can be difficult. A common {{approach}} in some histories and studies is to use Rocky Mountain Saints for those denominations headquartered in the American West and Prairie Saints for those denominations that formed in and around Nauvoo, Illinois; Voree, Wisconsin; Independence, Missouri; and other locations in <b>the</b> <b>Midwest</b> <b>and</b> East. These terms do not necessarily relate the current geographical locations of all denominations within those two groupings, but rather the original location of their respective parent organizations, which may be seen in the table below.|$|E

Ohio had three city-regions in the top 30 biotech locations in the country, with Cleveland-Akron ranked #20, Columbus #22, and Cincinnati #28.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, the Klan's {{public support}} nearly {{vanished}} and their membership dropped to about 100,000 people, primarily {{concentrated in the}} South, having lost most of their members in <b>the</b> <b>Midwest</b> <b>and</b> West. At that time, James A. Colescott, Evans' handpicked chief of staff, increasingly shouldered Evans' responsibilities. After the Great Depression further damaged the Klan's finances, the group's leadership sold their Atlanta headquarters in 1936. Around that time, Evans announced his intention to retire.|$|E
5|$|Patricia Jones {{was born}} Patricia Clements, {{one of six}} {{children}} born to Mr. and Mrs. Elmer Clements of St. Joseph, Missouri. After graduating from a local high school, she married Walter T. Jones, Jr., her high school sweetheart. Walter Jones enlisted in the Marine Corps shortly after their marriage, and the couple relocated {{to the west coast}} while Jones served. After his discharge from the military, they returned to <b>the</b> <b>midwest</b> <b>and</b> settled in Independence with their two children. By 1960, almost five years into the marriage, Patricia was working as a file clerk for the Internal Revenue Service, while her husband sold cars.|$|E

The band continued its boycott against Ticketmaster during its tour of the United States, refusing to play in Ticketmaster's venue areas, but was surprised that virtually no other bands joined it in refusing to play at Ticketmaster venues. The band chose to use alternate ticketing companies for the shows.|$|E
5|$|Some {{controversy}} has existed over {{the origins of}} captive breeding stock used by The Peregrine Fund in the recovery of peregrine falcons throughout the contiguous United States.

Due to the extirpation of the eastern anatum (Falco peregrinus anatum), the near extirpation of the anatum in <b>the</b> <b>Midwest,</b> <b>and</b> the limited gene pool within North American breeding stock, the inclusion of non-native subspecies was justified to optimize the genetic diversity found within the species as a whole.|$|E
