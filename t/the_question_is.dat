5|$|A related {{theme is}} the moral compromises {{individuals}} make in order to succeed in immoral political systems. In an interview about Taking Sides, Szabó said, “I don't think that life is possible without making compromises. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> only one of limits: how far to go. When one crosses the line, then the compromise starts to be a bad, even deadly, one.” This theme is dominant in the Brandauer trilogy and, as Istvan Deak points out, {{may be related to}} Szabó’s own collaboration with the Communist secret police.|$|E

50|$|The first reel has a {{range of}} {{categories}} of questions on it, each given a star rating of up to three stars. One star means <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> of easy difficulty, two stars mean <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> of medium difficulty and three stars mean <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> of hard difficulty. After a category has been used, it {{is replaced by a}} new category, with any unused categories from a previous show being re-used.|$|R

He concluded: ...|$|R

25|$|However, today {{many believe}} {{it more likely}} that the genes start on the same chromosome. They argue that supergenes arose in situ. This is known as Turner's sieve hypothesis. John Maynard Smith agreed with this view in his {{authoritative}} textbook, but <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> still not definitively settled.|$|E
25|$|Advocates for single-payer {{point to}} support in polls, {{although}} the polling is mixed {{depending on how}} <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> asked. Polls from Harvard University in 1988, the Los Angeles Times in 1990, and the Wall Street Journal in 1991 all showed strong support for a health care system comparable to the system in Canada.|$|E
5000|$|There <b>are</b> 4 <b>questions</b> in each Final Individual Event. <b>The</b> <b>questions</b> have to <b>be</b> {{solved by}} {{alternate}} contestants independently, and no discussions are allowed. For each event, <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> interrelated, i.e. to solve <b>the</b> second <b>question,</b> <b>the</b> answer of <b>the</b> first <b>question</b> <b>is</b> needed, and {{to solve the}} third, the answer from the second is needed, etc..|$|R

30|$|This {{is a short}} {{measure of}} general health [11]. <b>The</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> {{answered}} via multiple choice options and are grouped to produce eight health scales in two main categories, physical health and mental health. <b>The</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> then each scored to produce the physical and mental component summary scores.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> to be {{answered}} whether the expedient adopted has overlept the bounds of power. The assailants of the statute say that its dominant end and aim is to drive the state legislatures under the whip of economic pressure into the enactment of unemployment compensation laws at the bidding of the central government.|$|E
25|$|The {{interrogative}} form can {{be formed}} by two methods: The intonation and the Suffix -š. When an interrogative adverb or pronoun exists, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> an āš {{question that is}} equivalent to the English wh question and if the question does not involve any interrogative adverb or pronoun, it is an īh/lā question that {{is equivalent to the}} English Yes/No Question.|$|E
25|$|The neural {{correlates}} of consciousness constitute the minimal set of neuronal events and mechanisms sufficient {{for a specific}} conscious percept. Neuroscientists use empirical approaches to discover neural {{correlates of}} subjective phenomena. The set should be minimal because, if the brain is sufficient to give rise to any given conscious experience, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> which of its components is necessary to produce it.|$|E

5000|$|In 1767, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> {{raised in}} <b>the</b> meeting house {{whether it was}} [...] "consistent with the Christian spirit to hold a person inslavery". After years of discussion, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> {{answered}} in 1776 by the resolution that meetings were not to accept financial contributions or services from members owning slaves.|$|R

25|$|To try {{and define}} climate policy as a {{trade-off}} against foreign aid {{is thus a}} forced choice that bears no relationship to reality. No government is proposing that the marginal costs associated with, for example, an emissions trading system, should be deducted from its foreign aid budget. This way of posing <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> both morally inappropriate and irrelevant to the determination of real climate mitigation policy.|$|E
25|$|This {{answer is}} either correct or incorrect, {{depending}} on how <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> asked. The probability of being chosen each time is 25% but probability of being chosen at least once across the 4 events is higher. In this case, the correct answer is around 68%, calculated as the complement of the probability of not being chosen {{in any of the}} four quarters: 1 – (0.754).|$|E
25|$|Although a {{polymorphism}} can {{be controlled}} by alleles at a single locus (e.g. human ABO blood groups), the more complex forms are controlled by supergenes consisting of several tightly linked genes on a single chromosome. Batesian mimicry in butterflies and heterostyly in angiosperms are good examples. There is a long-standing debate as to how this situation could have arisen, and <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> not yet resolved.|$|E
50|$|In the Lightning Round, <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> {{assigned}} point values (two, four, or six, {{with six}} questions of each value) {{by a panel}} of judges before the game starts. <b>The</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> asked rapidly, and a correct answer earns its value; however, unlike the Wager Round, there is no penalty for answering incorrectly.|$|R
30|$|Involving {{emotional}} {{events in}} the process of teaching improves memory and eases overcoming misconceptions (Cahill et al. 1994). Therefore, suspense stories like “How Galileo overcame superstitions” raise emotions improving memory and attendance thus easing concept change, according to results of neurological research (Erk et al. 2003). This memory improvement is confirmed by research on perception of movement (Gibson and Gibson 1994; Shapiro 2010). When <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> answered by students, fewer misconceptions showed up when <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> described by a picture, which can raise emotions as when <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> put in a linear form.|$|R

25|$|Phone A Friend: With this lifeline, {{the player}} may call one {{of up to}} three pre-arranged friends and ask for help. The host calls the player's friend and {{introduces}} him/her to the viewers. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> only read out by the contestant to the phone friend once the host allows him or her to.

25|$|Undue {{influence}} is an equitable doctrine that involves one person {{taking advantage of}} a position of power over another person through a special relationship such as between parent and child or solicitor and client. As an equitable doctrine, the court has discretion. When no special relationship exists, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> whether there was a relationship of such trust and confidence that it should give rise to such a presumption.|$|E
25|$|The {{ideology}} of D66 {{is a highly}} contested subject within the party. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> tied to the reason for its existence. There are two currents within the party: the radical democrats and the progressive liberals. These two currents, although sometimes antagonistic, currently complement each other, as both emphasize the self-realisation of the individual. The Radical League and the Free-thinking Democratic League, two early twentieth century parties are historic exponents of these two traditions.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> of {{critical}} importance during {{the rule of the}} Nazi party in Germany, which persecuted the Jews and defined them for the government's purposes by the Nuremberg Laws. In 2009, a United Kingdom court considered whether <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> a racial issue, in the case R(E) v Governing Body of JFS (2009).|$|R
25|$|The {{private sector}} {{partners}} {{pulled out of}} the Plains Upgrader because upgrading heavy oil at that time was a risky financial proposition. To be economic, these projects rely on substantial differences in pricing ("differentials") between light and heavy crude oil. Heavy oil is worth less than light oil; <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> How much less? Unless upgraded oil fetched considerably more per barrel than the less attractive heavy oil, the upgrader would not make money on processing the stuff.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> {{complicated}} by the circumstance of {{the great majority of}} individuals that have come under observation being either in a completely or partially domesticated state. Many are also descended from ancestors that have previously been domesticated, a state that tends to produce a certain amount of variation from the original type. The four forms commonly distinguished by the inhabitants of South America are recognized as distinct species, though with difficulties in defining their distinctive characteristics.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> {{how can the}} {{differences}} between social wasp mimics and bumblebee mimics be explained? Evidently if model species are common, and have overlapping distributions, {{they are less likely}} to be polymorphic. Their mimics are widespread and develop a kind of rough and ready jack-of-all-trades mimicry. But if model species are less common and have patchy distribution they develop polymorphism; and their mimics match them more exactly and are polymorphic also. The issues are currently being investigated.|$|E
