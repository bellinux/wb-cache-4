5|$|Bowie never <b>talked</b> <b>of</b> his {{exploits}} {{despite his}} increasing fame. Captain WilliamY. Lacey, who spent eight months {{living in the}} wilderness with Bowie, described him as a humble man who never used profanity or vulgarities.|$|E
5|$|Beauchamp {{arrived in}} Frankfort on November 15, 1825. New Court partisans <b>talked</b> <b>of</b> Sharp's murder {{as the work}} of the Old Court party, just as Beauchamp had hoped. One suspect was Waring, who had printed the handbills {{critical}} of Sharp. Known as a violent man, he had both political and personal motivation for the crime. He was cleared of suspicion when investigators learned that, {{at the time of the}} murder, Waring was in Fayette County recovering from unrelated injuries.|$|E
5|$|Brandon Stosuy, of Pitchfork Media, <b>talked</b> <b>of</b> a {{black metal}} {{influence}} in the album's imagery.

5|$|Doubt {{was cast}} on this by Robert Dickson in 1878, when {{he pointed out}} that, while {{relatively}} high-status goods were found {{in some of the}} graves disinterred during early building work in Carnoustie, {{there was a lack of}} weapons. He also <b>talked</b> <b>of</b> the apparent presence of female skeletons. Subsequent finds pointed to the area being a domestic Pictish Long-Cist cemetery, including the remains of a female aged between 40 and 50 with osteoarthritis, who apparently died of tuberculosis. In contrast with Holinshed's account, the burials there are Christian, found in a supine, east-west orientation.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, Queensland was a weak cricketing state, {{having only}} been {{admitted}} to the Sheffield Shield in 192627, and the national selectors tended to choose Australia teams composed entirely of New South Welshmen, Victorians and South Australians. New South Wales' Bert Oldfield was the incumbent wicket-keeper and {{had no plans to}} retire, while Victoria's Ben Barnett had been the reserve keeper on the 1934 tour of England. South Australia's Charlie Walker was also <b>talked</b> <b>of</b> as a possible Test player.|$|E
5|$|On 17 September 1595 Clement VIII had {{accepted}} the decision of Henry IV of France to convert to the Catholic Church, which Henry had previously made to secure the French monarchy, and presided over a ceremony of papal absolution. This removed the excommunication order placed on him by Sixtus V. The Spanish faction had previously opposed the pope taking these actions, but the French negotiators had <b>talked</b> <b>of</b> the possibility of schism, which along with Henry's victories in the French Wars of Religion, overcame their opposition.|$|E

5|$|The {{change in}} tactics {{appeared}} to be effective, as October state elections in Ohio and Indiana resulted in Republican victories there, discouraging Democrats about their chances the following month. Democratic party leaders had selected English as Hancock's running mate because of his popularity in Indiana. With their state-level defeat there, some <b>talked</b> <b>of</b> dropping English from the ticket, but he convinced them that the October losses owed more to local issues, and that the Democratic ticket could still carry Indiana, if not Ohio, in November.|$|E
5|$|Among the organisations that Playford {{belonged to}} was the local {{branch of the}} Liberal Federation, yet until the months {{preceding}} his eventual election, he never <b>talked</b> <b>of</b> holding political office. The Liberal Federation was considering a merger with the Country Party to avoid Labor retaining office during the Great Depression. Archie Cameron, an old wartime friend of Playford's and a federal Coalition MP, influenced Playford {{to run for office}} when he heard of the merger. In 1932 the Liberal and Country League (LCL) was created, and Playford ran for the multi-member constituency of Murray at the 1933 election.|$|E
5|$|Continuing to emphasise good {{relations}} with the white settlers, in August 1963 Kenyatta met with 300 white farmers at Nakuru. He reassured them that they would be safe and welcome in an independent Kenya, and more broadly <b>talked</b> <b>of</b> forgiving and forgetting the conflicts of the past. Despite his attempts at wooing white support, he did not do the same with the Indian minority. Like many indigenous Africans in Kenya, Kenyatta bore a sense of resentment towards this community, despite the role that many Indians had played in securing the country's independence. He also encouraged the remaining Mau Mau fighters to leave the forests and settle in society. However, throughout Kenyatta's rule, many of these individuals would remain unemployed, with unemployment being one of the most persistent problems facing his government.|$|E

5|$|Crittenden was {{appointed}} to the United States Senate in 1842, filling the vacancy caused by Clay's resignation. In January 1843, he was elected to a full term over Richard Mentor Johnson. The Whigs' feud with President Tyler continued unabated, and some even <b>talked</b> <b>of</b> impeaching him, but Crittenden condemned that course of action. During the 27th and 28th Congresses, he served on the Committee on Military Affairs. He was an advocate of moderate protective tariffs and federal internal improvements. He opposed giving states the option to forgo apportionment, which would have allowed them to elect their congressmen at-large.|$|E
5|$|Following Jones' rejection, Garrard vetoed a {{bill that}} would have allowed the {{legislature}} to select the state's presidential and vice-presidential electors; despite the fact that the law ran contrary to the state constitution, Garrard's veto further strained his relations with the Senate. After the Senate rejected nominee William Trigg, the state's newspapers openly <b>talked</b> <b>of</b> an executive-legislative feud and claimed the Senate had its own favorite candidate for the position and would not accept anyone else. When the Senate rejected Willis Green in January 1804, Garrard declared that he would make no more nominations for the position. Accusations of bad faith were exchanged between the governor and the Senate, after which Garrard nominated John Adair, the popular Speaker of the House. The Senate finally confirmed this choice.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, James Baker {{died at the}} age of 41, {{leaving an}} opening in the GCC. On this {{occasion}} Watts Morgan was permitted to advance as a Labour candidate and was returned unopposed. By 1903 he was being <b>talked</b> <b>of</b> as a possible candidate for a south Wales parliamentary constituency. He joined the South Wales Miners' Federation at its inception and by 1902 he was pushing for a greater political role for the organisation. By 1908 the Federation was making great headway in the Rhondda and was substantially improving conditions for the miners. At this time Watts Morgan was Agent and District Secretary at No.1 Rhondda District under William Abraham.|$|E

5|$|In {{the later}} part of Richard's reign, the {{pressures}} mounted on Walter. Conflicts between his ecclesiastical duties {{and his government}} duties made him the target of criticism from both sides. A dispute in December 1197, over Richard's demand that the magnates of England provide 300knights to serve in France, led to renewed grumbling among the clergy and barons. Richard was also dissatisfied {{with the results of}} the carucage in 1198, so Walter resigned his position of chief justiciar on 11 July of that year. Walter may have resigned willingly, as he had <b>talked</b> <b>of</b> resigning his secular duties since 1194. Some medieval sources, however, stated that he was forced out of office by the king.|$|E
5|$|Shein {{constructed}} {{lines of}} circumvallation around the fortress. Using tunnels and mines, his forces damaged a long {{section of the}} city wall and one of its towers. Russian heavy artillery, mostly of Western manufacture, reached Smolensk in December 1632 with even heavier guns arriving the following March. After a preliminary artillery bombardment, Shein ordered an assault, which was repulsed by the Polish defenders. Nonetheless the siege was progressing; Smolensk's fortifications were being eroded, and the defenders were suffering heavy casualties and running out of supplies. By June 1633, some soldiers started to desert, and others <b>talked</b> <b>of</b> surrender.|$|E

5|$|After the bungled murder, Raskolnikov {{falls into}} a feverish state and begins to worry obsessively over the murder. He hides the stolen items and purse under a rock, and tries desperately to clean his {{clothing}} of any blood or evidence. He {{falls into a}} fever later that day, though not before calling briefly on his old friend Razumikhin. As the fever comes and goes in the following days, Raskolnikov behaves as though he wishes to betray himself. He shows strange reactions to whoever mentions {{the murder of the}} pawn-broker, which is now known about and <b>talked</b> <b>of</b> in the city. In his delirium, Raskolnikov wanders Saint Petersburg, drawing more and more attention to himself and his relation to the crime. In one of his walks through the city, he sees Marmeladov, who has been struck mortally by a carriage in the streets. Rushing to help him, Raskolnikov gives the remainder of his money to the man's family, which includes his teenage daughter, Sonya, who has been forced to become a prostitute to support her family.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{military}} service, Evo {{returned to his}} family, who had escaped the agricultural devastation of 1980's El Niño storm cycle by relocating to the Tropics of Cochabamba in the eastern lowlands. Setting up home {{in the town of}} Villa 14 de Septiembre, El Chapare, using a loan from Evo's maternal uncle, the family cleared a plot of land in the forest to grow rice, oranges, grapefruit, papaya, bananas and later on coca. It was here that Morales learned to speak Quechua, the indigenous local language. The arrival of the Morales family was a part of a much wider migration to the region; in 1981 El Chapare's population was 40,000 but by 1988 it had risen to 215,000. Many Bolivians hoped to set up farms where they could earn a living growing coca, which was experiencing a steady rise in price and which could be cultivated up to four times a year; a traditional medicinal and ritual substance in Andean culture, it was also sold abroad as the key ingredient in cocaine. Evo joined the local soccer team, before founding his own team, New Horizon, which proved victorious at the August 2nd Central Tournament. The El Chapare region remained special to Morales for many years to come; during his presidency he often <b>talked</b> <b>of</b> it in speeches and regularly visited.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the {{emotional}} distractions, {{during the summer of}} 1910 Mahler worked on his Tenth Symphony, completing the Adagio and drafting four more movements. He and Alma returned to New York in late October 1910, where Mahler threw himself into a busy Philharmonic season of concerts and tours. Around Christmas 1910 he began suffering from a sore throat, which persisted. On 21 February 1911, with a temperature of 40°C (104°F), Mahler insisted on fulfilling an engagement at Carnegie Hall, with a program of mainly new Italian music, including the world premiere of Busoni's Berceuse élégiaque. This was Mahler's last concert. After weeks confined to bed he was diagnosed with bacterial endocarditis, a disease to which sufferers from defective heart valves were particularly prone, and for which the survival rate in pre-antibiotic days was almost zero. Mahler did not give up hope; he <b>talked</b> <b>of</b> resuming the concert season, and took a keen interest when one of Alma's compositions was sung at a public recital by the soprano Frances Alda, on 3 March. On 8 April the Mahler family and a permanent nurse left New York on board SS Amerika bound for Europe. They reached Paris ten days later, where Mahler entered a clinic at Neuilly, but there was no improvement; on 11 May he was taken by train to the Löw sanatorium in Vienna, where he died on 18 May.|$|E
