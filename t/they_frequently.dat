5|$|In {{southern}} Chad, bitter {{conflicts over}} land {{are becoming more}} and more common. <b>They</b> <b>frequently</b> turn violent. Long-standing community culture is being eroded – and so are the livelihoods of many farmers.|$|E
5|$|Chestnut sparrows are gregarious, and {{are only}} {{occasionally}} found away from flocks. <b>They</b> <b>frequently</b> associate with queleas and other weavers. Adults feed on grass seeds, and those near human habitations will also eat crumbs and other household scraps. Nestlings are fed mostly softer grass seeds, and small beetles are also recorded in their diet.|$|E
5|$|Cubes, {{cylinders}} and pimples {{were deployed}} in long rows, often several rows deep, to form anti-tank barriers at beaches and inland. They {{were also used}} in smaller numbers to block roads. <b>They</b> <b>frequently</b> sported loops at the top for the attachment of barbed wire. There was also a tetrahedral or caltrop-shaped obstacle, although it seems these were rare.|$|E
50|$|The longclaws are a genus {{of small}} African {{passerine}} birds with long tails, which <b>they</b> wag <b>frequently.</b> <b>They</b> {{are in the}} same family as the pipits and wagtails.|$|R

5|$|Hamilton and Jefferson had the {{greatest}} impact on cabinet deliberations during Washington's first term. Their deep philosophical differences set them against each other from the outset, and <b>they</b> <b>frequently</b> sparred over economic and foreign policy issues. With Jefferson's departure, Hamilton came to dominate the cabinet, and Washington continued to turn to him for advice even after Hamilton resigned from the Cabinet.|$|E
5|$|The Young {{brothers}} {{decided to}} abandon the glam rock image which had already been adopted by Melbourne band The Skyhooks and pursue a harder blues-rock sound. To this end they agreed that Evans was not a suitable frontman for the group. Around this time, they also moved their base to Melbourne, where <b>they</b> <b>frequently</b> played at the Hard Rock.|$|E
5|$|The genre {{has always}} had its {{greatest}} appeal for white males. Most of the musicians involved were male, {{as was the case}} for most rock music of the time, Female singers were better represented in the progressive folk bands, who displayed a broader range of vocal styles than the progressive rock bands with whom <b>they</b> <b>frequently</b> toured and shared band members.|$|E

5|$|The ships saw service {{during the}} Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912 with the Ottoman Empire. <b>They</b> <b>frequently</b> {{supported}} Italian ground forces during the campaigns in North Africa and {{the islands of}} the eastern Mediterranean Sea. They served during World War I, in which Italy participated from 1915 to 1918, but they saw no combat {{as a result of}} the cautious policies adopted by the Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies. All four ships were discarded between 1923 and 1926 and broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} themes running through the {{different}} discourses. One is the traditional theme of the early hesychasts and mystical theologians of the Christian East, especially the practices of faith (praxis) and asceticism (askesis) that <b>they</b> <b>frequently</b> taught as the way to reach direct experience of God (theoria). Specific practices discussed by Symeon include: repentance, detachment, renunciation, mercy, sorrow for sins, faith, and contemplation.|$|E
5|$|These birds forage on {{the ground}} or in vegetation; they also fly down from a perch to capture food. While foraging, <b>they</b> <b>frequently</b> spread their wings in a {{peculiar}} two-step motion to display the white patches. There is disagreement among ornithologists over the purpose of this behavior, with hypotheses ranging from deceleration to intimidation of predators or prey.|$|E

5|$|Although Athenian {{women were}} not legally {{permitted}} to dispose of large sums of money, <b>they</b> <b>frequently</b> had large dowries which supported them throughout their lives. Income from a dowry could be significant. The larger a woman's dowry relative to her husband's wealth, the more influence she was likely {{to have in the}} household since she retained the dowry if the couple divorced. Athenian women could also acquire property by inheritance if they were the closest surviving relative, but could not contractually acquire or dispose of property.|$|E
5|$|From 1878, Fauré and {{his friend}} and ex-pupil André Messager made trips abroad to see Wagner operas. They saw Das Rheingold and Die Walküre at Cologne Opera; the {{complete}} Ring cycle in Munich and London; and Die Meistersinger in Munich and at Bayreuth, where they also saw Parsifal. <b>They</b> <b>frequently</b> performed as a party piece their joint composition, the irreverent Souvenirs de Bayreuth, written in about 1888. This short, skittish piano work for four hands sends up themes from The Ring. It consists of five short sections in which Wagner's themes are transformed into dance rhythms. The manuscript (in the Bibliothèque nationale, Paris) is in Messager's hand.|$|E
5|$|Heating is {{cost-effective}} at {{many more}} sites than electricity generation. At natural hot springs or geysers, {{water can be}} piped directly into radiators. In hot, dry ground, earth tubes or downhole heat exchangers can collect the heat. However, even {{in areas where the}} ground is colder than room temperature, heat can often be extracted with a geothermal heat pump more cost-effectively and cleanly than by conventional furnaces. These devices draw on much shallower and colder resources than traditional geothermal techniques. <b>They</b> <b>frequently</b> combine functions, including air conditioning, seasonal thermal energy storage, solar energy collection, and electric heating. Heat pumps can be used for space heating essentially anywhere.|$|E

5|$|Returning after {{a one-year}} hiatus {{and despite the}} return of players such as Cooney Weiland, Finnigan, Howe and Kilrea, the Senators {{finished}} with the worst record {{in the league in}} the two seasons that followed. Attendance was poor, the club only drawing well when the league's other three Canadian teams came to town. Frank Finnigan recalled that <b>they</b> <b>frequently</b> played home games before small crowds of 3,500 to 4,000. 1932–33 saw the return of Cy Denneny to Ottawa as coach. He would last only the one season. In June 1933, former captain Harvey Pulford was given an option to buy the team and move it to Baltimore, but the option was never exercised. In October 1933, Kilrea was sold for $10,000 to Toronto.|$|E
5|$|Sakic and {{his wife}} Debbie have three children: son Mitchell, born in 1996, and fraternal twins; son Chase and {{daughter}} Kamryn, born in October 2000. They met at a local high school while he was playing in Swift Current, and <b>they</b> <b>frequently</b> return to the town during the off-season. Sakic is an avid golfer, and competed in the celebrity Pro Am golf tournament in Lake Tahoe {{in the summer of}} 2006. Each summer, he also hosts his own charity golf tournament which benefits the Food Bank of the Rockies. His charity work, which is estimated to have provided more than seven million meals to poor children and families, has earned an NHL Foundation Player Award in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Temple {{construction}} {{did not end}} {{once the}} original plan was complete; pharaohs often rebuilt or replaced decayed temple structures or made additions to those still standing. In the course of these additions, <b>they</b> <b>frequently</b> dismantled old temple buildings to use as fill for the interiors of new structures. On rare occasions {{this may have been}} because the old structures or their builders had become anathema, as with Akhenaten's temples, but in most cases the reason seems to have been convenience. Such expansion and dismantling could considerably distort the original temple plan, as happened at the enormous Precinct of Amun-Re at Karnak, which developed two intersecting axes and several satellite temples.|$|E

5|$|The Canadiens have {{developed}} strong rivalries with two fellow Original Six franchises, with whom <b>they</b> <b>frequently</b> shared divisions and competed in post-season play. The oldest {{is with the}} Toronto Maple Leafs, who first faced the Canadiens as the Toronto Arenas in 1917. The teams met 15 times in the playoffs, including five Stanley Cup finals. Featuring the two largest cities in Canada {{and two of the}} largest fanbases in the league, the rivalry is sometimes dramatized as being emblematic of Canada's English and French linguistic divide. From 1938 to 1970, they were the only two Canadian teams in the league.|$|E
5|$|Trento and Trieste {{were named}} for the two largest unredeemed cities taken from Austria-Hungary in the {{aftermath}} of World War I. <b>They</b> <b>frequently</b> served as the flagship of the Cruiser Division throughout the 1930s. During the pre-war period, Trento made lengthy trips abroad, including a tour of South America from May to October 1929 and a deployment to China from January to June 1932 to protect Italian nationals during the Chinese Civil War. Both vessels took part in numerous naval reviews held for visiting foreign leaders in the 1930s, including Adolf Hitler of Nazi Germany and Miklós Horthy, the Regent of Hungary. In 1938 Trieste helped transport soldiers of the Corpo Truppe Volontarie (Corps of Volunteer Troops) that had been sent to Spain to fight in the Spanish Civil War return to Italy in 1938.|$|E
5|$|After the {{formation}} of the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, Johor Bahru continued as the state capital and more development was carried out, with the town's expansion and the construction of more new townships and industrial estates. The Indonesian confrontation did not directly affect Johor Bahru as the main Indonesian landing point in Johor was in Labis. There is only one active Indonesian spy organisation in the town, known as Gerakan Ekonomi Melayu Indonesia (GEMI). <b>They</b> <b>frequently</b> engaged with the Indonesian communities living there to contribute information for Indonesian commandos until the bombing of the MacDonald House in Singapore in 1965. By the early 1990s, the town had considerably expanded in size, and was officially granted a city status on 1 January 1994. Johor Bahru City Council was formed and the city's current main square, Dataran Bandaraya Johor Bahru, was constructed to commemorate the event. A central business district was developed in the centre of the city from the mid-1990s in the area around Wong Ah Fook Street. The state and federal government channelled considerable funds {{for the development of the}} city—particularly more so after 2006, when the Iskandar Malaysia was formed.|$|E
