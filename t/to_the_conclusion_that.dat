The Garden references exotic travel literature of the 15th century through the animals, including lions and a giraffe, in the left panel. The giraffe has been traced to Cyriac of Ancona, a travel writer known for his visits to Egypt during the 1440s.

5|$|Dominican missionaries {{were active}} in Verapaz and the {{southern}} Petén from the late 16th century through the 17th century, attempting non-violent conversion with limited success.

For example, wine is prohibited in Islam because of its intoxicating property. Thus qiyas leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that</b> all intoxicants are forbidden.|$|E
