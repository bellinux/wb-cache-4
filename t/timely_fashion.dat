5|$|A {{percentage}} {{of each group}} working in less contaminated areas was badged. Eventually, 18,875 film-badge dosimeters were issued to about 15% of the total work force. On {{the basis of this}} sampling, a theoretical total exposure was calculated for each person who did not have a personal badge. As expected, exposures for target ship crewmen who reboarded their ships after Baker were higher than those for support ship crews. The hulls of support ships that entered the lagoon after Baker became so radioactive that sleeping quarters were moved toward the center of each ship. Of the total mass of radioactive particles scattered by each explosion, 85% was unfissioned plutonium which produces alpha radiation not detected by film badges or Geiger counters. There was no method of detecting plutonium in a <b>timely</b> <b>fashion,</b> and participants were not monitored for ingestion of it.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the project}} was not without its trials. Edwards' initial plan to employ a team of writers was thwarted {{by a lack of}} {{resources}} and funds. He instead had to enlist historians based outside of the AWM for some of the volumes, who agreed to work on the history without financial compensation. The series also experienced problems with staff turnover. Aside from Pemberton, the unexpected death in 1998 of Ian McNeill—author of the volumes on the Australian Army—caused extensive delays to the series' completion. The first seven volumes (including McNeill's To Long Tan , dealing with army operations up to 1966), were delivered in a <b>timely</b> <b>fashion</b> and published successively from 1992 to 1998. However, McNeill's next volume was only partway written when he died. His research assistant, Ashley Ekins, was eventually appointed to complete the series. On the Offensive was published in 2003, while the final volume, Fighting to the Finish, appeared in 2012; two decades after the first volume, and sixteen years after Edwards' position at the AWM had ended. Again following the path of Bean and Long, Edwards was then commissioned by the AWM to write a single volume summary of the series. Australia and the Vietnam War was published by NewSouth in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Seoul unit {{director}} Dan Glass and Jim Mitchell {{were the}} visual effects supervisors {{of the first}} season. The season had a total VFX shot count of about 1200. An in-house VFX team was established in Chicago which completed over 700 shots. The major external VFX vendors were Locktix VFX (160-180 shots), Technicolor VFX (over 100 shots) and Encore VFX. Additional work was done by Studio 8 FX, Trace VFX and Almost Gold. Because of the series' tight budget and timeline the production {{made the decision to}} do most of the effects in-camera and only enhance them digitally where appropriate. In fact for a great number of shots which involved the sensates communicating and visiting each other telepathically the cast were simply moving {{in and out of the}} frame in <b>timely</b> <b>fashion</b> requiring no additional work. According to Glass, most of the VFX work that was done is invisible in the final show and consisted mostly of split-screens, crew and rig removal, weather augmentation and screen inserts. Executive producer Grant Hill commented he would be impressed if one would be able to recognize as many as 150 of the 1200 VFX shots, because most of them consisted of small things used to help the narrative, and they do not call attention to themselves. Of the more visible work done, Glass provided the examples of age manipulation of actors, dramatic enhancement of the weather in the car scenes in Iceland, a few greenscreens, and computer generated blades, blood and wounds.|$|E

40|$|The State of Hawaii is {{committed}} to modernizing our highway systems to meet the future needs of our people. Our state Department of Transportation has completed the Statewide Federal-Aid Highways 2035 Transportation Plan, providing a solid foundation for making informed land transportation planning decisions through the year 2035. It {{marks the first time}} in our islands that a transportation plan of this magnitude has been completed on a statewide scale. The benefits of this present-day work will be critical to Hawaii’s future goals of modernizing our transportation systems, improving safety on our highways, and meeting our ambitious, yet obtainable, sustainability goals. To accomplish this task, regional 2035 transportation plans for the counties of Honolulu, Maui, Hawaii, and Kauai have been updated and integrated into a single, comprehensive statewide plan. Public involvement and community input were key components in the planning effort, which embraced the unique social, cultural, and historical values of the people of Hawaii. Our sincerest thanks go to all of our citizens and stakeholders who participated in the process and provided their valuable insight. The Plan develops not only goals and objectives for transportation improvements, but also sets performance standards by which success will be measured. This performance gauge will allow for an objective and unbiased assessment of proposed improvements before they are implemented, streamlining and reducing waste throughout the process. This statewide plan, unprecedented in scope for the Aloha State, is an important step forward towards ensuring that transportation improvements can be implemented long-term in fiscally responsible and <b>timely</b> <b>fashions.</b> We will continue our collaborative efforts in our communities statewide to meet our future needs.

50|$|The V {{formation}} possibly {{improves the}} efficiency of flying birds, particularly over long migratory routes. All the birds except the first fly in the upwash {{from one of the}} wingtip vortices of the bird ahead. The upwash assists each bird in supporting its own weight in flight, in the same way a glider can climb or maintain height indefinitely in rising air. According to a 1970 paper, in a V formation of 25 members, each bird can achieve a reduction of induced drag and as a result increase their range by 71%. The birds flying at the tips and at the front are rotated in a <b>timely</b> cyclical <b>fashion</b> to spread flight fatigue equally among the flock members.

40|$|A stream {{warehouse}} is a Data Stream Management System (DSMS) that stores a {{very long}} history, e. g. years or decades; or equivalently a data warehouse that is continuously loaded.

However, continuously loading data from many different and uncontrolled sources into a real-time stream warehouse introduces a new consistency problem: users want results in as <b>timely</b> a <b>fashion</b> as possible, but “stable ” results often require lengthy synchronization delays. In this paper we develop a theory of temporal consistency for stream warehouses that allows for multiple consistency levels.

40|$|Our success {{over the}} past ten years {{evaluating}} and developing advanced computing technologies has been due to a simple research and development (R/D) model. Our model has three phases: (a) evaluating the state-of-the-art, (b) identifying problems and creating innovations, and (c) developing solutions, improving the state- of-the-art. This cycle has four basic requirements: a large production testbed with real users, a diverse collection of state-of-the-art hardware, facilities for evalua- tion of emerging technologies and development of innovations, and control over system management on these testbeds. Future research will be irrelevant and future products will not work if any of these requirements is eliminated. In order to retain our effectiveness, the numerical aerospace simulator (NAS) must replace out-of-date production testbeds in as <b>timely</b> a <b>fashion</b> as possible, and cannot afford to ignore innovative designs such as new distributed shared memory machines, clustered commodity-based computers, and multi-threaded architectures...|$|R
