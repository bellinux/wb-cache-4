25|$|A {{member of}} the Haliwa-Saponi Native American tribe {{recognized}} {{by the state of}} North Carolina, Faith Hedgepeth was born in 1992 in Warren County, part of the tribe's traditional territory. Her parents divorced within a year of her birth, and she was raised by her mother, with help from an older sister, in Hollister and Warrenton. Connie Hedgepeth named her third daughter Faith because she believed <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> needed to raise a third child when she already had two teenage daughters and a husband with a drug problem.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} evening, Sarah Jane {{agrees to}} adopt the Archetype and agrees with Maria to call him [...] "Luke", since <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wanted to name her child if she ever had one. The episode closes with a monologue by Sarah Jane that while space may be strange, adventures may be had on Earth, if one knows where to look.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha! ha! ha! Poor Mrs. Shortpointz! And {{she was so}} full of {{you last}} night. The beau ideal of manly beauty! <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> called you. She did indeed. Ha! ha! ha!" ...|$|E
60|$|AUGUSTUS [eagerly]. Yes: <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> usually calls me. Please go on.|$|R
60|$|Miss Mackenzie did {{not dare}} {{to say that she}} would have {{preferred}} to <b>be</b> wicked, but <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> would have said if she had dared.|$|R
6000|$|... "That <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{doing in}} Paris--at least <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> came to do, but the siege {{put a stop}} to her studies, and she devoted herself to the much more {{practical}} work of nursing the wounded." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> came for! All that way. Women are queer. Forgive. Not he! [...] . All at {{once this}} thought darted through his brain: How did she come? In a boat. Boat! boat! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank'ee, doctor, thank'ee. Yes; she {{has been}} a good wife--better for a poor man than a rich one; but then, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was born to. You won't let her be knocked about by them, will you, Thorne?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have spoken}} for yourself," [...] said the King; {{and he would}} have done just so to her had not the true Princess begged for her so that she was sent back again to tend the geese, for <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was fit for.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, you. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> intends me to understand." [...] The Jew {{had stopped}} {{at one of}} the corners, close under the little lamp, and looked intently into Nina's face as he spoke to her.|$|R
50|$|Lakshmi readily serves Surya as a servant, albeit {{at a low}} wage. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{expected}} to do. However, the villagers {{did not realize that}} Surya would find her attractive and ask her to do additional chores.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I know {{something}} much more bitter: and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> thinks of the bishop's wife. And you know, Mark, it was so unladylike, her getting up in that way. What must the people of Barchester think of her?" ...|$|R
60|$|As for Peter, he saw Wendy {{once again}} before he flew away. He did not exactly {{come to the}} window, but he brushed against it in passing, {{so that she could}} open it if she liked and call to him. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> did.|$|E
6000|$|Her {{husband said}} that <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she,</b> Mrs. Melbury, {{naturally}} thought; but {{there she was}} wrong, and in that lay {{the source of his}} trouble. [...] "I have a plan in my head about her," [...] he said; [...] "and according to my plan she won't marry a rich man." ...|$|E
60|$|His were laughing, but she glimpsed in them what, despite herself, {{made her}} veil her own {{with her long}} lashes. He knew. Beyond all {{possibility}} of error she knew now that he knew. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had seen {{in his eyes and}} what had made her veil her own.|$|E
60|$|As for Peter, he saw Wendy {{once again}} before he flew away. He did not exactly {{come to the}} window, but he brushed against it in passing {{so that she could}} open it if she liked and call to him. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> did.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Corbin moodily. [...] "What was the good? I know'd she'd got the letter,--and <b>she</b> did,--for <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wrote back." [...] He laid {{another letter}} before the Colonel, who hastily {{read a few}} lines and then brought his fat white hand violently on the desk.|$|R
50|$|Just as Belinda boards the stagecoach, Drew {{arrives and}} tells her {{he loves her}} {{and is willing to}} {{practice}} law in Boston while she's in medical school. Once she becomes a doctor, they will move back to this small town together if <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants. He asks her to marry him.|$|R
60|$|She meditated still. When {{she thought}} of their day {{it seemed to her}} it was cut into four pieces by their meals. These {{divisions}} were absolutely rigid, the contents of the day having to accommodate themselves within the four rigid bars. Looking back at her life, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> saw.|$|E
6000|$|She {{decided to}} go out into the London {{afternoon}} again and get something to eat in an Aerated Bread shop or some such place, and perhaps find a cheap room for herself. Of course <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had to do; she had to find a cheap room for herself and work! ...|$|E
60|$|This, too, {{was clear}} to her, and though she {{considered}} his attitude the correct one, it jarred a little upon her. She was content {{that they should be}} merely comrades, or, at least, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had endeavoured to convince herself, but, after all, there was no reason why he should emphasize the fact.|$|E
6000|$|Reddy went. There {{was nothing}} else to do. He didn't dare disobey. Granny watched until Reddy had readied his hiding-place. Then what do you think she did? Why, she walked right out on the little beach just below Reddy and in plain sight of Quacker! Yes, Sir, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> did! ...|$|R
50|$|Elena {{gets back}} home where Stefan {{is waiting for}} her on the porch. He brought Jeremy home and he <b>is</b> devastated himself <b>that</b> {{he could not help}} Vicki. Elena checks on Jeremy who does not {{understand}} what happened and wonders why everyone around him has to die. Elena comforts him and then goes back to Stefan asking him to make Jeremy forget what happened tonight. Stefan explains <b>that</b> because he <b>is</b> feeding on animals, he cannot do it right but Damon appears and volunteers to do it if <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> really wants. Elena says <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants and tells Damon what to tell Jeremy.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can make}} the story so in your mind, Ezra, because you are great, and like to fancy the {{greatest}} <b>that</b> could <b>be.</b> But I think it was not really like that. The Jewish girl must have had jealousy in her heart, and she wanted somehow to have the {{first place in the}} king's mind. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> would die for." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{was to be}} {{set free}} in three months. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant; we saw it. The Voices had told her so, and told her true--true to the very day--May 30th. But we know now that they had mercifully hidden from her how {{she was to be}} set free, but left her in ignorance. Home again! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But you ain't {{too warm}} now, though." [...] And it flattered her {{to reflect that}} she had {{discovered}} that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing that <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had in her mind. But in spite of her, Tom knew where the wind lay, now. So he forestalled {{what might be the}} next move: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{a strange}} thing to say, I think," [...] {{returned}} Miss Starbrow quickly. [...] "It is not my custom to be insincere." [...] And then her sincerity almost compelled her to add, [...] "But about your late husband I have said too much." [...] For <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> felt, and it vexed her soul to have to utter polite falsehoods.|$|E
50|$|Molly (Hoffs), Val (Pfeiffer) and Gina (Cusack) are graduating college, but {{on their}} final night, frustrations are aired. Molly is {{still looking for}} real love and Val is {{beginning}} to doubt if <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> has found. Gina is too busy videotaping everything to really notice. When the final party at Pacifica College kicks off, things do not go exactly as planned.|$|R
40|$|Beauty {{may be only}} skin {{deep and}} clothes may not make the woman, but Sally surely won 2 ̆ 7 t let those old and worthy adages keep her from trying her 2 ̆ 2 extra hardest to look her special best 2 ̆ 2 this spring-at least <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> told me {{in one of those}} {{intimate}} interviews of hers she rarely grants...|$|R
50|$|To the Shoshoni Cameahwait and Sacagawea were {{brother and}} sister. However, in Shoshoni {{language}} cousin and brother {{are the same}} word, indicating the tribe thinks of them as the same. Consequently, during the translation, when Sacagawea cried out that she recognized Cameahwait as her brother, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant, but whether they actually had the same father, let alone the same mother, is unclear.|$|R
60|$|She fretted, however, at last, {{over the}} lack of stability. When the perfect hours came back, her heart did not forget that they would pass away again. She was uneasy. The surety, the surety, the inner surety, the {{confidence}} in the abidingness of love: <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wanted. And {{that she did not}} get. She knew also that he had not got it.|$|E
60|$|Dick {{regarded}} the rosy fellowship pleasantly and long, finishing {{his cigarette and}} retaining it dead in his hand. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had needed, he mused--babies, children. It had been her passion. Had she realized it... He sighed, and, struck by a fresh thought, looked to her favorite seat with certitude {{that he would not}} see the customary sewing lying on it in a pretty heap. She did not sew these days.|$|E
6000|$|... "Please tell me--everything." [...] <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{wanted to}} say. He had drawn apart one little chink and showed {{astonishing}} treasures. It {{seemed to her}} incredible that {{a man like that}} should be willing to talk to her. He had sisters and pets, and once lived in the country. She stirred her tea round and round; the bubbles which swam and clustered in the cup seemed to her like the union of their minds.|$|E
6000|$|Marian {{could not}} help laughing, {{in spite of her}} deep feeling on the matter, and Lionel, who had acted the voice and the curtsey, laughed too, and then perhaps ashamed of making fun of such an affair, added, [...] "It is the best news I have heard this long time. <b>What,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> has <b>been</b> so dismal about these last few days, is it?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Later, a {{threatening}} note is slipped under their neighbor’s door. Their neighbor Mrs. Graybill, thinks that Sammy wrote the note. Mrs. Graybill threatens {{to call the}} police and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> did. The officers that arrived at the door were the same ones <b>that</b> <b>were</b> at the hotel last night. Even though Sammy says that she said that she did not write the note, no one believed her.|$|R
5000|$|EXAMPLE: A human being’s Determination is {{thinking}} reason, since <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> unalterably <b>is</b> {{in opposition to}} her Other: nature. However, humans are entangled in nature in myriad other ways than just thinking rationally about it, and how humans react to this external influence also tells us about <b>what</b> they <b>are.</b> This is their Constitution, the part of their being that undergoes alteration in relation to its Others.|$|R
