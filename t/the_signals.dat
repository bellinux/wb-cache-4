5|$|Each sensory system {{begins with}} {{specialized}} receptor cells, such as light-receptive neurons in the retina of the eye, or vibration-sensitive neurons in the cochlea of the ear. The axons of sensory receptor cells travel into {{the spinal cord}} or brain, where they transmit their signals to a first-order sensory nucleus dedicated to one specific sensory modality. This primary sensory nucleus sends information to higher-order sensory areas that are dedicated to the same modality. Eventually, via a way-station in the thalamus, <b>the</b> <b>signals</b> are sent to the cerebral cortex, where they are processed to extract the relevant features, and integrated with signals coming from other sensory systems.|$|E

5|$|Many arctiid moths make clicks when hunted by echolocating bats; {{they also}} often contain {{unpalatable}} chemicals. Some such as dogbane tiger moths (Cycnia tenera) have ears and conspicuous coloration, {{and start to}} make clicks when echolocating bats approach. An experiment by Canadian zoologists John M. Ratcliffe and James H. Fullard, using dogbane tiger moths and northern long-eared bats (Myotis septentrionalis), suggests <b>the</b> <b>signals</b> in fact both disrupt echolocation and warn of chemical defence. The behaviour of these insects is thus both deimatic and aposematic.|$|E
5|$|Monocytes {{develop in}} the bone marrow and reach {{maturity}} in the blood. Mature monocytes have large, smooth, lobed nuclei and abundant cytoplasm that contains granules. Monocytes ingest foreign or dangerous substances and present antigens to other cells of the immune system. Monocytes form two groups: a circulating group and a marginal group that remain in other tissues (approximately 70% are in the marginal group). Most monocytes leave the blood stream after 20–40 hours to travel to tissues and organs {{and in doing so}} transform into macrophages or dendritic cells depending on <b>the</b> <b>signals</b> they receive.

5|$|The Delmar Bypass {{was opened}} in December 1963, {{connecting}} Elm Avenue {{in the west}} to U.S. Route9W in the east.

In mid-January 1964, the Bethlehem Town Board pushed the state to add traffic lights to every intersection in the wake of several accidents and near-misses at the crossings. This request was eventually granted. The Delmar Bypass did not have a signed route number until the 1970s when NY32 was realigned to follow the highway. As a result, NY335 no longer connected to a signed route at its south end.|$|E
30|$|Another {{problem is}} the {{bandwidth}} of instrument. In simulations, <b>the</b> <b>signal</b> bandwidth is only limited by the sampling frequency.

When the bandwidth of instrument is narrower than that of <b>the</b> <b>signal,</b> <b>the</b> <b>signal</b> passing <b>the</b> instrument will be distorted. Especially, <b>the</b> <b>signal</b> bandwidth will increase after the predistortion. The bandwidth of <b>the</b> predistorted <b>signal</b> is wider than that of <b>the</b> original input <b>signal.</b> Thus, if <b>the</b> bandwidth of instrument is not sufficiently wide, the desired predistortion will be not achieved.|$|R
50|$|An early {{breakthrough}} in <b>signal</b> processing was <b>the</b> Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem.
