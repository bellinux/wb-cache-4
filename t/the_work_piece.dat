5|$|For {{internal}} broaching {{the sides of}} the broach are drafted inward so it becomes thinner; for external broaching the sides are drafted outward, to make the pocket bigger. This draft keeps the broach from jamming; the draft must be larger than the angle of misalignment. If <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> rotates, the broach is pressed against it, is driven by it, and rotates synchronously with it. If the tool holder rotates, the broach is pressed against the workpiece, but is driven by the tool holder.|$|E
25|$|The main {{advantage}} of press forging, {{as compared to}} drop-hammer forging, {{is its ability to}} deform the complete workpiece. Drop-hammer forging usually only deforms the surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> in contact with the hammer and anvil; the interior of the workpiece will stay relatively undeformed. Another advantage to the process includes the knowledge of the new part's strain rate. By controlling the compression rate of the press forging operation, the internal strain can be controlled.|$|E
25|$|The grain {{direction}} {{can be determined}} {{by looking at the}} edge or side of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>piece.</b> Wood fibers can be seen running out to the surface that is being planed. When the fibers meet the work surface it looks like the point of an arrow that indicates the direction. With some very figured and difficult woods, the grain runs in many directions and therefore working against the grain is inevitable. In this case, a very sharp and finely-set blade is required.|$|E
5000|$|Ultrasonic {{vibration}} machining physically operates by {{the mechanism}} of microchipping or erosion on <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>piece's</b> surface. Since <b>the</b> abrasive slurry is kept in motion by high frequency, low amplitude vibrations the impact forces of the slurry are significant causing high contact stresses. These high contact stresses are achieved by the small contact area between the slurry's particles and <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>piece's</b> surface. Brittle materials fail by cracking mechanics and these high stresses are sufficient to cause micro-scale chips {{to be removed from}} its surface. The material as a whole does not fail due to the extremely localized stress regions. The average force imparted by a particle of the slurry impacting <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>piece's</b> surface and rebounding can be characterized by the following equation: ...|$|R
2500|$|For {{very rapid}} and rough removal of stock, the blade is drawn toward the user and rapidly levered {{into the wood}} to make as deep a cut as possible. The {{operator}} immediately stops pulling, and uses the drawknife blade to lever upward so as to [...] "flick" [...] the splinter or splice out of <b>the</b> <b>worked</b> <b>piece.</b> This technique is advanced and may damage <b>the</b> <b>worked</b> <b>piece</b> and drawknife blade if due care is not observed.|$|R
50|$|Magnetic {{pulse welding}} {{is based on}} a very short {{electromagnetic}} pulse (<100µs), which is obtained by a fast discharge of capacitors through low inductance switches into a coil. The pulsed current with a very high amplitude and frequency (500kA and 15 kHz) produces a high-density magnetic field, which creates an eddy current in one of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>pieces.</b> Repulsive Lorentz forces are created and a high magnetic pressure well beyond the material yield strength causing acceleration and one of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>pieces</b> impacts onto <b>the</b> other part with a collision velocity up to 500 m/s.|$|R
25|$|When done in high productivity, {{press forging}} is more {{economical}} than hammer forging. The operation also creates closer tolerances. In hammer forging {{a lot of}} the work is absorbed by the machinery; when in press forging, the greater percentage of work is used in <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>piece.</b> Another advantage is that the operation can be used to create any size part because there is no limit {{to the size of the}} press forging machine. New press forging techniques have been able to create a higher degree of mechanical and orientation integrity. By the constraint of oxidation to the outer layers of the part, reduced levels of microcracking occur in the finished part.|$|E
25|$|Liquids tend to {{have better}} thermal {{conductivity}} than gases, {{and the ability to}} flow makes a liquid suitable for removing excess heat from mechanical components. The heat can be removed by channeling the liquid through a heat exchanger, such as a radiator, or the heat can be removed with the liquid during evaporation. Water or glycol coolants are used to keep engines from overheating. The coolants used in nuclear reactors include water or liquid metals, such as sodium or bismuth. Liquid propellant films are used to cool the thrust chambers of rockets. In machining, water and oils are used to remove the excess heat generated, which can quickly ruin both <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> and the tooling. During perspiration, sweat removes heat from the human body by evaporating. In the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning industry (HVAC), liquids such as water are used to transfer heat from one area to another.|$|E

50|$|Brazing {{differs from}} welding {{in that it}} does not involve melting <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>pieces</b> and from {{soldering}} in using higher temperatures for a similar process, while also requiring much more closely fitted parts than when soldering. The filler metal flows into the gap between close-fitting parts by capillary action. The filler metal is brought slightly above its melting (liquidus) temperature while protected by a suitable atmosphere, usually a flux. It then flows over the base metal (known as wetting) and is then cooled to join <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>pieces</b> together. It is similar to soldering, except for the use of higher temperatures. A major advantage of brazing is the ability to join the same or different metals with considerable strength.|$|R
50|$|After {{programming}} <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>pieces</b> {{and entering}} length of bars the control automatically calculates {{the maximum number}} of pieces to be punched (for example 18 pieces of a bar of 6000 mm). Once the desired number of <b>work</b> <b>pieces</b> is entered, <b>the</b> bar is pushed toward the stop. The machine is fully automated once the production process is launched.|$|R
50|$|In Inertia Friction Welding {{the drive}} motor is disengaged, and <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>pieces</b> are forced {{together}} by a friction welding force. The kinetic energy stored in the rotating flywheel is dissipated as heat at the weld interface as the flywheel speed decreases.|$|R
2500|$|Modern {{computer}} {{numerical control}} (CNC) lathes and (CNC) machining centres can do secondary operations like milling by using driven tools. When driven tools are used <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> stops rotating and the driven tool executes the machining operation with a rotating cutting tool. [...] The CNC machines use x, y, and z coordinates {{in order to control}} the turning tools and produce the product. Most modern day CNC lathes are able to produce most turned objects in 3D.|$|E
2500|$|Brazing is a joining {{process in}} which a filler metal is melted and drawn into a {{capillary}} formed by the assembly {{of two or more}} work pieces. [...] The filler metal reacts metallurgically with the workpiece(s) and solidifies in the capillary, forming a strong joint. [...] Unlike welding, <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> is not melted. [...] Brazing is similar to soldering, but occurs at temperatures in excess of [...] [...] Brazing has the advantage of producing less thermal stresses than welding, and brazed assemblies tend to be more ductile than weldments because alloying elements can not segregate and precipitate.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{plasma cutting}} process {{involves}} creating an electrical channel of superheated, electrically ionized gas i.e. plasma from the plasma cutter itself, through <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> to be cut, thus forming a completed electric circuit {{back to the}} plasma cutter via a grounding clamp. This is accomplished by a compressed gas (oxygen, air, inert and others depending on material being cut) which is blown through a focused nozzle at high speed toward <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>piece.</b> An electrical arc is then formed within the gas, between an electrode near or integrated into the gas nozzle and <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> itself. The electrical arc ionizes some of the gas, thereby creating an electrically conductive channel of plasma. As electricity from the cutter torch travels down this plasma it delivers sufficient heat to melt through <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>piece.</b> At the same time, much of the high velocity plasma and compressed gas blow the hot molten metal away, thereby separating i.e. cutting through <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>piece.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{production}} system {{consisting of a}} work station, a loading and unloading stations linked by a closed-loop material-handling system is considered. The material-handling system consists of two continuous line conveyors. Each conveyor is assumed to have a specified constant velocity, length and capacity. <b>The</b> <b>work</b> station is assumed to have a single machine, an unloading station and no local storage. In this {{production system}} <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>pieces,</b> which at their instant of arrival find <b>the</b> <b>work</b> station busy, are blocked. Those <b>work</b> <b>pieces</b> bypass <b>the</b> <b>work</b> station and are transported by the conveyor to the loading station to merge with <b>the</b> incoming <b>work</b> <b>pieces</b> to be transported to <b>the</b> <b>work</b> station again. <b>The</b> above production system is modeled by a G/G/ 1 / 0 queueing loss system with retrials, stationary counting arrival process, generally distributed service times, a single server and no waiting room. <b>The</b> flow of <b>work</b> <b>pieces</b> inside <b>the</b> system is modeled by a point process and is approximated by a renewal process. To analyze the asymptotic performance of the above system, a recursive procedure is developed. Furthermore, an expression for the asymptotic distribution of <b>the</b> number of <b>work</b> <b>pieces</b> along each conveyor is derived and is used to control the congestion along the material handling system. Finally numerical results are provided and compared against those from a simulation study...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The plastic {{analysis}} software DEFORM {{was used}} to simulate the blanking process of metal plastic without burr.
