30|$|Remanence {{measurements}} {{were carried out}} using a 2 G 3 -component DC SQUID magnetometer (model 755 – 4.2  cm discrete sample system) at the Center for Advanced Marine Core Research (CMCR), Kochi University. We used a sample holder specially designed for zircon measurements. The holder was made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and cylindrical form of 7  mm in diameter and 6  cm in length (Additional file 1 : Figure S 1). The sample holder was fixed in a stainless rod and inserted into a sensing region of the magnetometer. The zircon crystal was sandwiched between the two Scotch Magic <b>Transparent</b> <b>Tapes</b> of 5 [*]×[*] 5  mm (sandwiched sample) and set at an edge of the holder using the Scotch Double Sided Tape (3  M). To keep a sample orientation, we fixed the zircon crystal sandwiched between the <b>Transparent</b> <b>Tapes</b> from NRM measurement to end of demagnetization/remanence measurement processes. In a sequence of remanence measurements, the sample holder was fixed in the stainless rod, and we only changed the sandwiched sample at an edge of the holder.|$|R

5000|$|... 3M {{manufactures}} Scotch Tape {{brand of}} tape, {{which accounted for}} 90% of the U.S. <b>transparent</b> <b>tape</b> market until the early 1990s, concededly a monopoly. Around 1980 LePage's decided to sell private label <b>transparent</b> <b>tape,</b> which is tape sold under the retailer's name rather than {{under the name of}} the manufacturer. By 1992, LePage's sold 88% of U.S. private label tape, which represented, however, {{only a small portion of}} the U.S. <b>transparent</b> <b>tape</b> market. LePage's sold its private label tape to retailers at a lower price to the retailer and the customer than branded tape such as Scotch Tape. In response to the growth of this market segment, 3M entered this submarket with a second, [...] "off brand" [...] tape and private-label tape. In addition, 3M engaged in actions allegedly aimed at restricting the availability of cheap off-brand <b>transparent</b> <b>tape</b> to consumers, including establishing a bundling program that prevented LePage's from gaining or maintaining large volume sales. Allegedly, 3M maintained its monopoly by stifling growth of private label tape and by coordinating efforts aimed at large distributors to keep retail prices for Scotch Tape high.|$|E

5000|$|LePage's {{argued that}} 3M willfully {{maintained}} its monopoly in the <b>transparent</b> <b>tape</b> market by bundling rebates and entering into contracts that expressly or effectively required dealing exclusively with 3M. 3M argued that its challenged conduct was legal {{as a matter}} of law because it never priced its <b>transparent</b> <b>tape</b> below its cost. The Third Circuit said this was [...] "the most significant legal issue in this case because it underlies 3M's argument." [...] 3M's position was that [...] "above-cost pricing cannot give rise to an antitrust offense {{as a matter of}} law, since it is the very conduct that the antitrust laws wish to promote in the interest of making consumers better off." [...] In its oral argument before the court, 3M counsel stated that [...] "if the big guy is selling above cost, it has done nothing which offends the Sherman Act" [...] and that is [...] "the end of the story." ...|$|E

5000|$|Making custom wigs {{starts with}} {{measuring}} the subject's head. The natural hair is arranged in flat curls against the head as the various measurements are taken. It is often helpful {{to make a}} pattern from layers of <b>transparent</b> adhesive <b>tape</b> applied over a piece of plastic wrap, on which the natural hairline can be traced accurately. These measurements are then transferred to the [...] "block", a wooden or cork-stuffed canvas form {{the same size and}} shape as the client's head.|$|R
30|$|Stereomicroscopy was {{performed}} at low magnification (7.5 × to 150 ×) on a Zeiss Discovery V 20 microscope while inspection at higher magnification {{was performed}} in transmission mode on a Zeiss AxioImager M 2 m compound microscope. Microsamples of the white haze were acquired for transmission optical microscopy using a tungsten needle and then transferring the sample to <b>transparent</b> adhesive <b>tape</b> that was adhered to a glass microscope slide. Photomicrographs were taken using a Zeiss ERc 5 digital camera on the stereomicroscope and a Zeiss MRc 5 on the compound microscope.|$|R
50|$|Diagnosis {{depends on}} finding the eggs or the adult pinworms. Individual eggs are {{invisible}} to the naked eye, {{but they can be}} seen using a low-power microscope. On the other hand, the light-yellowish thread-like adult pinworms are clearly visually detectable, usually during the night when they move near the anus, or on toilet paper. <b>Transparent</b> adhesive <b>tape</b> (e.g. Scotch Tape) applied on the anal area will pick up deposited eggs, and diagnosis can be made by examining the tape with a microscope. This test is most successful if done every morning for several days, because the females do not lay eggs every day, and the number of eggs vary.|$|R
5000|$|In 1923, Richard Gurley Drew {{working for}} 3M invented masking tape, a paper-based tape with a mildly sticky adhesive. In 1925 this became the Scotch brand masking tape. In 1930, Drew {{developed}} a <b>transparent</b> <b>tape</b> based on cellophane, called Scotch Tape. This tape was widely used {{beginning in the}} Great Depression to repair household items. Author Scott Berkun has written that duct tape is [...] "arguably" [...] a modification of this early success by 3M. However, neither of Drew's inventions was based on cloth tape.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} of the icophone is {{the representation of the}} sound by a spectrograph. The spectrogram analyzes a word, a phrase, or more generally a sound, and shows the distribution of the different frequencies with their relative intensities. The first machines to synthesize words were made by displaying the form of the spectrogram on a <b>transparent</b> <b>tape,</b> which controls a series of oscillators following {{the presence or absence of}} a black mark on the tape. Leipp succeeded in decomposing the segments of a spoken sound phenomenon, and in synthesizing them from a very simplified display.|$|E
50|$|Culture test: This is {{the most}} effective, but also the most time-consuming, way to {{determine}} if ringworm is on a pet. In this test, the veterinarian collects hairs from the pet, or else collects fungal spores from the pet's hair with a toothbrush, or other instrument, and inoculates fungal media for culture. These cultures can be brushed with <b>transparent</b> <b>tape</b> and then read by the veterinarian using a microscope, or {{can be sent to}} a pathological lab. The three common types of fungi which commonly cause pet ringworm can be identified by their characteristic spores. These are different-appearing macroconidia in the two common species of Microspora, and typical microconidia in Trichophyton infections.|$|E

5000|$|... 3M offered many of LePage's major {{customers}} substantial rebates (often $1 {{million or}} more) to induce them {{to reduce or}} stop their purchases of tape from LePage's. 3M's rebate programs offered discounts to certain customers conditioned on purchases in six of 3M's diverse, unrelated product lines. The product lines covered by the rebate program were: Health Care Products, Home Care Products, Home Improvement Products, Stationery Products (including <b>transparent</b> <b>tape),</b> Retail Auto Products, and Leisure Time products. 3M's rebate programs set customer-specific target growth rates in each product line. The size of the rebate {{was linked to the}} number of product lines in which targets were met, and the number of targets met by the buyer determined the size of the rebate it would receive on all of its purchases. If a customer failed to meet the target for any one product, its failure would cause it to lose the rebate across the line. The court observed, [...] "This created a substantial incentive for each customer to meet the targets across all product lines to maximize its rebates."
