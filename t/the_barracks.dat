5|$|A {{defensible}} barracks made of brick, {{faced in}} Kentish ragstone on the fort's exterior, closes off the gorge. Its line is indented to facilitate small arms fire from loopholes and windows with armoured steel shutters. The {{first floor of}} <b>the</b> <b>barracks</b> had a veranda facing towards the fort's interior and supported on cast-iron pillars. <b>The</b> <b>barracks</b> provided accommodation for a wartime complement of six officers and 180 NCO and men, though in peacetime only small maintenance detachments occupied the fort. It also accommodated storerooms and a hospital with room for fourteen patients. Although much of <b>the</b> <b>barracks</b> is now in poor condition, two of the kitchen ranges still survive and two rooms still contain service crests painted on their walls during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|According to the JNA an {{additional}} 450 troops were deployed to <b>the</b> <b>barracks</b> (despite the blockade) from 22 October to 4 November, primarily tank crews {{assigned to the}} 9th Motorised Brigade and two companies of SAO Krajina TO from Vojnić. The reinforcements crossed the Korana River, adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>barracks,</b> and their movements led to several skirmishes. By 4 November, <b>the</b> <b>barracks</b> housed a 685-strong garrison. During {{the second half of}} October, the 129th and 137th Infantry Brigades were established in Karlovac and nearby Duga Resa to bolster Croatian defences. The two new brigades were assigned areas of responsibility (AORs) on 29 November by the Karlovac Operational Zone commanding officer, Colonel Izidor Češnjaj; the 110th and 137th Brigade AORs were just south of the Logorište barracks. The 137th Infantry Brigade was commanded by Major Nedjeljko Katušin. The 110th Infantry Brigade deployed three companies of its 1st Battalion north and west of the Logorište barracks, while three companies of its 3rd Battalion were deployed south of <b>the</b> <b>barracks.</b> Further south, three companies of the 3rd Battalion of the 137th Infantry Brigade faced the Korana. The 1/110th Brigade was supported by two companies of police (including an antitank and sniper group of special police reserve troops commanded by Želimir Feitl) in Sv. Doroteja, north of <b>the</b> <b>barracks.</b> The 3/137th Brigade was supported by {{an additional}} company of police. The 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Guards Brigade was ordered to redeploy to Banovina; most of its troops were on leave or had left the area, and only a squad remained {{in the rear of the}} 137th Infantry Brigade.|$|E
5|$|As {{previously}} planned, {{most of the}} Texians {{fell back}} to <b>the</b> <b>barracks</b> and the chapel. Holes had been carved in the walls to allow the Texians to fire. Unable to reach <b>the</b> <b>barracks,</b> Texians stationed along the west wall headed west for the San Antonio River. When the cavalry charged, the Texians took cover and began firing from a ditch. Sesma was forced to send reinforcements, and the Texians were eventually killed. Sesma reported that this skirmish involved 50Texians, but Edmondson believes that number was inflated.|$|E

5000|$|There {{were two}} set of <b>barracks</b> in Waterford: <b>the</b> {{infantry}} <b>barracks</b> on <b>the</b> North side of Barrack Street and <b>the</b> artillery <b>barracks</b> on <b>the</b> South side. It {{is not known}} when <b>the</b> infantry <b>barracks</b> were established but it is accepted that <b>the</b> artillery <b>barracks</b> {{were built in the}} aftermath of the Irish Rebellion and completed at the end of the 18th century. During the First World War <b>the</b> artillery <b>barracks,</b> at that time known as <b>the</b> cavalry <b>barracks,</b> served as <b>the</b> 1st cavalry depot providing accommodation for the 5th Royal Irish Lancers, the 9th Queen's Royal Lancers, the 12th Royal Lancers, the 16th The Queen's Lancers, the 17th Lancers and the 21st Lancers.|$|R
5|$|Both sides claimed victory {{after the}} battle, with the JNA hailing the {{evacuation}} of the garrison as its greatest success. However, they achieved only part of their objectives; the JNA failed to secure the area surrounding <b>the</b> <b>barracks</b> or remove all the weapons and equipment in it, and the planned coordinated advance against Turanj also failed. Croatian forces failed in their primary objective: containing the garrison. Nonetheless, the JNA threat from the Logorište barracks was removed (freeing up forces assigned to the blockade of <b>the</b> <b>barracks)</b> {{and a large number}} of weapons were captured.|$|E
5|$|The JNA {{evacuated}} 21 T-55 tanks, nine T-34s, an armoured recovery vehicle, an armoured vehicle-launched bridge, ten APCs (including an armoured command vehicle) and 50 vehicles carrying military equipment. Elements of the 110th Infantry Brigade {{entered the}} Logorište barracks {{on the morning}} of 6 November, removing some of the military hardware in <b>the</b> <b>barracks</b> before pulling out at 1:00p.m. after being informed that the JNA was planning an artillery attack. Captured equipment continued to be removed from <b>the</b> <b>barracks</b> until 13 November.|$|E
5|$|The JNA's Stjepan Milašinčić-Seljo {{barracks in}} Logorište, south of Karlovac, {{was one of}} the largest weapons-storage {{facilities}} in Croatia. <b>The</b> <b>barracks</b> contained weapons and equipment for the 8th Proletarian Motorised Brigade, the 471st Mixed Antitank Artillery Brigade, elements of the logistics battalion of the 580th Mixed Artillery Brigade, an armoured battalion of the 236th Proletarian Motorised Brigade and 200 tonnes of fuel and stockpiled food assigned to the 944th Logistics Base. During the summer of 1990, a mechanised battalion of the 4th Armoured Brigade was moved from Jastrebarsko to the Logorište barracks. When the battalion was deployed to Lika in late March 1991, about 40 men remained at <b>the</b> <b>barracks</b> (whose fortifications were improved). <b>The</b> <b>barracks</b> commander was Lieutenant Colonel Boro Ercegovac, who was also commanding officer of the 8th Proletarian Motorised Brigade.|$|E

5|$|The events {{started on}} 30 August 1942 after the Japanese recaptured four POWs {{escaped from the}} Selarang Barracks camps, and {{required}} that the other prisoners sign a pledge not to escape. After they refused, {{they were forced to}} crowd in the areas around <b>the</b> <b>barracks</b> square for nearly five days with little water and no sanitation. The executions of the recaptured POWs failed to break the men. The commanders, however, finally capitulated on 5 September when their men started to fall ill and die from dysentery. Upon signing the pledge, the men were allowed to return to <b>the</b> <b>barracks</b> buildings.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the failure}} of their attempt to take control of <b>the</b> <b>barracks,</b> the VNQDĐ leaders did not get around to seizing the train station and {{reinforcing}} it. They also forgot to cut the telegraph lines, allowing the colonial forces to send a message requesting air support.|$|E
5|$|No {{preparations}} {{had been}} made for their reception, accommodation had not been set aside and no food had been prepared. The children were placed {{in different parts of}} the camp based on their condition. The healthy and stronger children were housed in <b>the</b> <b>barracks,</b> weaker and sick children were accommodated in the castle, and the very weak and those suffering from typhus were lodged in the monastery. Only Serb children were kept in the camp, and they came from all over the NDH. They had previously been kept at the camps at Stara Gradiška, Jasenovac, Jablanac, Cerovljani, Mlaka, Gornja Reka and areas of Slavonia. Those accommodated in <b>the</b> <b>barracks</b> had no electricity or running water, and food initially consisted of little more than cornflour.|$|E

5|$|On 14 September the ZNG and Croatian police {{blockaded}} and cut {{utilities to}} all accessible JNA facilities, beginning the Battle of <b>the</b> <b>Barracks.</b> The move affected 33 large JNA garrisons in Croatia {{and a number}} of smaller facilities (including border posts and weapons- and ammunition-storage depots), forcing the JNA to change its plans for the Croatian campaign.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Battalion of the ZNG's 110th Infantry Brigade {{blockaded}} <b>the</b> <b>barracks</b> on 19 September {{to contain}} the JNA and prevent the removal of weapons. The blockade was poorly organised, allowing a pair of tanks to leave <b>the</b> <b>barracks</b> and raid a nearby settlement two days later; however, according to Croatian sources one tank was destroyed during the raid. To relieve blockaded garrisons in the Karlovac area the JNA redeployed the 169th Motorised Brigade from Loznica and three detachments of the TO from Vojnić, assigning them to Operational Group 1 (OG-1). OG-1 attacked Croatian defences on 4 October, reaching the east bank of the Korana River on 8 October. The 169th Motorised Brigade collapsed due to inadequate manpower, {{and was replaced by}} the 9th Motorised Brigade (brought in from Serbia) on 15 October.|$|E
5|$|The {{basement}} {{contains the}} gunner's mess, canteen, No. 1 ancillary store, pantry and officer's kitchen. The canteen sold everyday necessities {{as well as}} a few items like biscuits, sweets and tobacco to the stationed troops. Profits from the canteen were used to fund sporting equipment for the garrison. The No.1 ancillary store was used for various pieces of delicate equipment, fuses, friction tubes and rockets. In 1887 an explosion in the room caused a number of injuries, damage to the store and to the above officer's quarters. <b>The</b> <b>barracks</b> room and officer's quarters are connected with a door, probably added in the 1930s as it {{is not part of the}} original plans. <b>The</b> <b>barracks</b> room accommodated approximately 20 men. For display purposes it is outfitted as for similar period barracks.|$|E

5|$|After {{a period}} of siege {{with little or no}} activity, the JNA forces in the Logorište barracks in the Karlovac area broke through the {{blockade}} towards the JNA-held territory to the east of the city in the Battle of Logorište, which lasted from 4 to 6 November. The Croatian forces besieging <b>the</b> <b>barracks</b> were more numerous, but the JNA had superiority in armour and artillery. After it was abandoned by the JNA, <b>the</b> <b>barracks</b> still contained weapons which were taken away by the Croatian troops by November 13. The ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojskaHV) in early November. It captured the Jamadol barracks and storage facility in Karlovac on 4 November, while the fighting around the Logorište barracks was in progress. The following day, the HV captured JNA barracks and several weapons storage facilities in Delnice. The attacks were ordered to capture ammunition needed by the HV because its stockpile was running low.|$|E
5|$|Arbroath {{is home to}} 45 Commando of the Royal Marines, {{who have}} been based at RM Condor since 1971. <b>The</b> <b>barracks</b> were {{originally}} built in 1940 and commissioned as RNAS Arbroath/HMS Condor, a Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS) until 1971.

The Royal Marines from 45 Commando were recently engaged on operations in Afghanistan and have deployed in support of operations in Iraq and the Falklands War. In 2004, there was speculation that RM Condor would be transferred to the Army as a replacement for Fort George and that <b>the</b> <b>barracks</b> would become a permanent base for a battalion of the Royal Regiment of Scotland. These plans never went beyond the planning stage and in 2005 it was confirmed the Royal Marines would remain based at the site.|$|E

5|$|In a {{radio address}} on May 11, Alley {{announced}} {{that due to}} the nullification, the military would heve {{to stay in power}} beyond June 17.
