5|$|During {{the late}} Jurassic, Europe was a dry, {{tropical}} archipelago {{at the edge}} of the Tethys Sea. The fine limestone in which the skeletons of Compsognathus have been found originated in calcite from the shells of marine organisms. Both the German and French areas where Compsognathus specimens have been preserved were lagoons situated between the beaches and coral reefs of the Jurassic European islands in the Tethys Sea. Contemporaries of Compsognathus longipes include the early avialan Archaeopteryx lithographica and the pterosaurs Rhamphorhynchus muensteri and Pterodactylus antiquus. The same sediments in which Compsognathus have been preserved also contain fossils of a number of marine animals such as fish, crustaceans, echinoderms and marine mollusks, confirming the coastal habitat of this theropod. No other dinosaur has been found in association with Compsognathus, indicating that these little dinosaurs might in fact have been the <b>top</b> <b>land</b> predator in these islands.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Devonian period (360 {{million years}} ago), the seas, rivers and lakes were teeming with life while the land was the realm of early plants and devoid of vertebrates, though some, such as Ichthyostega, may have {{sometimes}} hauled themselves out of the water. It is thought they may have propelled themselves with their forelimbs, dragging their hindquarters in a similar manner to that used by the elephant seal. In the early Carboniferous (360 to 345 million years ago), the climate became wet and warm. Extensive swamps developed with mosses, ferns, horsetails and calamites. Air-breathing arthropods evolved and invaded the land where they provided food for the carnivorous amphibians that began to adapt to the terrestrial environment. There were no other tetrapods on the land and the amphibians were {{at the top of the}} food chain, occupying the ecological position currently held by the crocodile. Though equipped with limbs and the ability to breathe air, most still had a long tapering body and strong tail. They were the <b>top</b> <b>land</b> predators, sometimes reaching several metres in length, preying on the large insects of the period and the many types of fish in the water. They still needed to return to water to lay their shell-less eggs, and even most modern amphibians have a fully aquatic larval stage with gills like their fish ancestors. It was the development of the amniotic egg, which prevents the developing embryo from drying out, that enabled the reptiles to reproduce on land and which led to their dominance in the period that followed.|$|E

2500|$|... 2008 saw Land Rover's 60th anniversary, {{for which}} {{a new series of}} special edition Defenders were produced. Branded the [...] "SVX", three models were built. All were painted black with [...] "satin" [...] effect body {{graphics}} on the vehicles sides and bonnet carrying the [...] "60th" [...] logo used throughout 2008 at various special events and on anniversary merchandise. Bespoke five-spoke alloy wheels were used and a new silver-coloured front grille design was used. This also incorporated a new design of headlamp with the sidelight lamp being integral with the main headlamp unit, allowing the space previously used for the separate sidelight to be used to fit a pair of high-intensity driving lamps. Inside the SVX models gained Recaro bucket seats in the front row, alloy gearlever knobs and a Garmin GPS navigation system. The drivetrain was the standard 2.4-litre diesel and six-speed manual permanent four-wheel-drive transmission. The SVX edition was available as a 110 (only available outside the UK), a 90 and a brand-new design of 90 soft top- the first time a soft top model had been available through showrooms in the UK since 1992. SVX soft tops had only the two front seats- the rear load bay being used to accommodate the spare wheel and a lockable storage box. A new design of hood was used, sloping down towards the rear over a jointed folding frame, unlike the standard square-framed hood used on other soft <b>top</b> <b>Land</b> Rovers.|$|E

50|$|The {{extension}} excavated in Les Raboses {{is about}} 90 m2. The {{potential of the}} site is large and {{it is estimated that}} its surface may be 2500 m2. The available space was modified by building structures, based on four terracing walls, which would create the space used for the construction of rooms and entries or passageways. The upper platform of the site was occupied by a room structure, which used the face of the first terracing wall as an internal wall. The lower zone would consist of a solid trapezoidal structure, with a possible controlling or defensive function. The materials used in construction are local rodeno slabs, limestone blocks of the very <b>top,</b> <b>land,</b> clays and plant cover elements, which are reflected in the imprints.|$|E

5000|$|The sQuba is a zero-emission, all {{electric}} vehicle which uses three electric motors, one for land travel, two for water.

It can be submerged {{to a depth of}} 10 m, powered by twin electric-powered propellers supplemented by two Seabob water jets.

5000|$|Through the {{influence}} of Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, George C. Yount received the two square league Rancho Caymus in 1836, {{and became the first}} permanent Euro-American settler in the Napa Valley. In 1843 he received the one square league Rancho La Jota on Howell Mountain to the north of Rancho Caymus. [...] Yount planned to construct a sawmill on the mountain <b>top</b> <b>land.</b> [...] With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho La Jota was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852. The Land Commission rejected Yount’s claim, but the United States District Court reversed the decision. [...] The Rancho La Jota grant was patented to George C. Yount in 1857. Edwin Angwin in 1875 purchased 200 acre and established the Angwin Resort. By the 1900s Edwin owned almost 1600 acre. The community of Angwin is named after him. In 1909, Angwin sold the property to the Seventh-day Adventist Church who established Pacific Union College on the site.|$|E
