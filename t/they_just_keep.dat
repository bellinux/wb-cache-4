500|$|The group {{recorded}} a third album, Positive, {{which came out}} in June 1991. [...] It was produced by Mark Moffatt, who had also worked with Mental As Anything and Jenny Morris. The album produced three singles, including the gospel-flavoured track, [...] "Hope" [...] (August 1990), [...] "I Must Have Been Blind" [...] (May 1991), and a cover of the Brenda Lee song, [...] "Here Comes That Feeling" [...] (August 1991). [...] Their version of the Brenda Lee song was featured in the 1990 film, The Crossing, starring Russell Crowe and Danielle Spencer. According to McFarlane, [...] "By {{the end of the}} year... The Cockroaches as a band concept had run its course". However, journalist Glenn A. Baker, in the liner notes for the group's March 1994 album, St. Patrick's Day 10am, states, [...] "The Cockroaches never went away, <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> playing, very much in the mode of their earlier days". He also declared, [...] "The sound of the Cockies seems to embody all of the basic concepts of rock'n'roll as we've always known and loved it. Its rangy, loose-limbed, good-natured, energetic, self-effacing, intuitive, harmonic, melodic, enduring, soused and fiercely frantic". The performers for the album were: the three Field brothers; Fatt on Hammond organ, keyboards and cow noises; Henry on drums and cabasa; Mackie on bass guitar and backing vocals; with additional backing vocals by Jane Bezzina, Greg Truman and Steve Pomfrett. [...] It was {{recorded a}}t the Tracking Station and Noisegate Studios, was mixed by Pomfrett and John, was engineered by Pomfrett, and was produced by the band.|$|E
500|$|Padres {{general manager}} Kevin Towers said Hoffman {{was the first}} one in and the last one out of the {{ballpark}} everyday. Hoffman adhered to a daily conditioning program. When pitcher Jeremy Fikac was promoted to the majors in 2001, Hoffman invited him to join him on his usual afternoon run. [...] "I remember sitting in the bullpen that night, and my legs were still trembling from the run", Fikac recalled. [...] "I'd run before, but not at that pace ... I was thinking, I hope they don't call on me because I can't feel my legs under me ... His work ethic is unbelievable." [...] Bochy said, [...] " [...] one of those guys like Tony Gwynn—they never feel like they've arrived. Tony never thought, 'Well, I'm hitting [...]360 ... ' He was never content. And Trevor's the same way. <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> working and make sure that they've got goals they want to reach." [...] After every save opportunity, whether he converted it or blew it, Hoffman would sit in the dugout for up to five minutes after his teammates had cleared out. Whether it was the euphoria from success or the sting of failure, he would sit there and drain all the emotion out of himself, put the game behind him, and move on. Tracy Hoffman said, [...] "He's all about order. That's the foundation to what he does. You see it when he's on the field. He's always the same, win or lose. He doesn't smile, doesn't show any emotion." [...] Padres manager Bud Black marveled at Hoffman's regimen. [...] "The daily preparation for his job, that focus and dedication each day to prepare for the ninth inning ... It was incredible to see live", said Black. [...] "I played with George Brett, a Hall of Famer who was a great worker. But Trevor took it to a level and a commitment and Hall of Fame caliber." [...] After Hoffman resurrected his final season and recorded his 600th save, Macha said Hoffman's [...] "work ethic and perseverance paid off ... He had to grind it out to get there." ...|$|E

In 2006 Gingrich criticized George W. Bush's stance toward North Korea and Iran, stating that it was [...] "a form of appeasement". He said, [...] "We have accepted the lawyer-diplomatic fantasy that talking while North Korea builds bombs and missiles while the Iranians build bombs and missiles is progress." [...] He has also severely criticized the foreign policy of President Obama for being too weak. Gingrich singled out Obama's responses to terrorism, North Korea, and Iran as particularly problematic. On North Korea he said, [...] "There was amazing symbolism in North Korea deciding to launch a missile the very day President Obama was speaking to Europeans about his fantasy of nuclear disarmament. The West has talked with North Korea for over 15 years and <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> building nuclear weapons and missiles. We have been talking with the Iranians for a decade and they continue to build nuclear capability and missiles." ...|$|E

5000|$|Showtime {{president}} David Nevins {{praised the}} series finale against fan backlash, saying: [...] "The fundamental design {{of where they}} ended Dexter was really well conceived.

[...] Nevins also said there were never any discussions to kill off Dexter, and <b>they</b> didn't <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> the character alive for a potential spinoff series.

6000|$|The Scottish hinds, {{too poor}} to house In frosty nights their {{starving}} cows, While not a blade of grass or hay Appears from Michaelmas to May, Must let their cattle range in vain For food along the barren plain: Meagre and lank with fasting grown, And nothing left but skin and bone; Exposed to want, and wind, and weather, <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> life and soul together, Till summer showers and evening's dew Again the verdant glebe renew; And, as the vegetables rise, The famish'd cow her want supplies; Without an ounce of last year's flesh; Whate'er she gains is young and fresh; Grows plump and round, and full of mettle, As rising from Medea's [1] kettle.

'Tis just the case; for you have fasted So long, till all your flesh is wasted; And must against the warmer days Be sent to Quilca down to graze; Where mirth, and exercise, and air, Will soon your appetite repair: The nutriment will from within, Round all your body, plump your skin; Will agitate the lazy flood, And fill your veins with sprightly blood. Nor flesh nor blood {{will be the same}} Nor aught of Stella but the name: For what was ever understood, By human kind, but flesh and blood? And if your flesh and blood be new, You'll be no more the former you; But for a blooming nymph will pass, Just fifteen, coming summer's grass, Your jetty locks with garlands crown'd: While all the squires for nine miles round, Attended by a brace of curs, With jockey boots and silver spurs, No less than justices o' quorum, Their cow-boys bearing cloaks before 'em, Shall leave deciding broken pates, To kiss your steps at Quilca gates. But, lest you should my skill disgrace, Come back before you're out of case; For if to Michaelmas you stay, The new-born flesh will melt away; The 'squires in scorn will fly the house For better game, and look for grouse; But here, before the frost can mar it, We'll make it firm with beef and claret.|$|E
