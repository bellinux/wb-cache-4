40|$|Assessment of {{citizenship}} competences has become common practice following the statutory assignment {{of citizenship}} education to schools in many countries.

In this paper we evaluate four <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruments</b> and their suitability to assess citizenship competences.

50|$|A {{homogenizer}} is a {{piece of}} laboratory or industrial equipment used for the homogenization of various types of material, such as tissue, plant, food, soil, and many others. Many different models have been developed using various physical technologies for disruption. The 'mortar and pestle', already used for thousands of years, is a standard tool even in modern laboratories. More modern solutions are based on blender <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruments</b> (also known in the kitchen), bead mills, ultrasonic treatment (also sonication), rotor-stator mechanical, high pressure, and many other physical forces.Cell fractionation is done by homogenizer to release the organelles from cell. Whereas older technologies just focused on the disruption of the material, newer technologies also address quality or environmental aspects, such as cross-contamination, aerosols, risk of infection, or noise. Homogenization is a very common sample preparation step prior to the analysis of nucleic acids, proteins, cells, metabolism, pathogens, and many other targets.|$|E

5000|$|On-line mass {{spectrometry}} was develop to {{solve some of}} the limitations and problem that develop from off-line analysis, such as evaporation and chemical reactions of particles in the filters during long analysis time. On-line Mass spectrometry solves these problems by being applied to collect and analysis aerosol particles instantaneously. On-line instruments are very portable and allow for spatial variability to be examined. [...] These portable instruments can be put on many different platforms such as boats, planes, and mobile platforms (e.g. car trailers). An {{example of this is}} in the picture at the beginning with the instrumentation attached to an aircraft. Like off-line, on-line {{mass spectrometry}} has many different <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruments,</b> which can be broken up into two types; instruments that measures the chemistry of the particle ensemble (bulk measurement) and those that measure the chemistry of individual particles (single-particle measurement). Thus based on analytical need different instrumentation is used in analysis of the aerosol particles.|$|E

[...] Stone Temple Pilots became the third album Weiland had ever recorded sober, after Velvet Revolver's Libertad and Stone Temple Pilot's first album, Core. Weiland was also influenced by his ex-wife, Mary Forsberg, about whom he specifically wrote on [...] "Cinnamon". Weiland's inspiration for [...] "First Kiss on Mars" [...] came from the music itself. He explained his lyrics succinctly: [...] "When I first heard song, it sounded intergalactic." [...] Critics and interviewers of the band noticed that Weiland's vocalizations were drawn from David Bowie.|$|E

First, a schematic view of the main cost-containment methods and the variables in the health system they intend to influence is presented. Two types of instruments to control the level and growth of public health expenditure are considered: (i) provider payment methods that influence the price and quantity of health care, and (ii) cost-containment measures that influence the behaviour of patients. Belonging to the first <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruments,</b> we have: fee-for-service, per diem payment, case payment, capitation, salaries and budgets. The second <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruments</b> consists of patient charges and reference price systems for pharmaceuticals.
