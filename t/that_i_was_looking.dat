500|$|The {{unanimous}} {{winner of}} the NL Most Valuable Player Award, he became the fourth player in National League history to win by this distinction, and the first Astros player to win the award. [...] Bagwell also won his first Silver Slugger, Gold Glove, and Player of the Year Awards from The Sporting News, Associated Press, Baseball Digest, and USA Today Baseball Weekly. [...] "Crazy stuff happened that year", Bagwell recalled of his 1994 season. [...] "Every pitch <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> for, I got. [...] And when I got it, I didn't miss it." [...] The Astros and Bagwell agreed to a four-year contract on November 23, 1994, worth $27.5 million (USD, $ million today) with the three option years. [...] The average annual value of $6.875 million ($ million today) made him the fifth-highest paid player in the majors.|$|E
500|$|At the 1963 {{convention}} of the newly formed East Coast Homophile Organizations, the audience heard a speaker named Dr. Albert Ellis tell them that [...] "the exclusive homosexual" [...] was a psychopath. Articles and essays in The Ladder sometimes carried these viewpoints, since {{it was difficult to}} get psychiatrists and doctors to address homosexuality in any form. Gittings said, [...] "People like Ellis talked about homosexuality being a sickness. And they talked about a cure...We'd sit there and listen and politely applaud and then go for the social hour afterward." [...] However, after Dr. Ellis spoke, so did gay activist Frank Kameny, making an impression upon Gittings with his point that it is useless to try to find cures and causes for homosexuality since there is no valid evidence that it is an illness. Said Gittings, [...] "My thinking didn't change until Frank Kameny came along and he said plainly and firmly and unequivocally that homosexuality is no kind of sickness or disease or disorder or malfunction, it is fully on par with heterosexuality...Suddenly I found <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> at things that had happened in the past in a very different light and I was taking a position that was increasingly diverging from DOB’s positions." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1936, Feller {{was signed}} by Cy Slapnicka, a scout for the Indians, for one dollar and an autographed baseball. While {{scouting}} Feller, Slapnicka said, [...] "This was a kid pitcher I had to get. I knew he was something special. His fastball was fast and fuzzy; it didn't go in a straight line; it would wiggle and shoot around. I didn't know then that he was smart and had {{the heart of a}} lion, but I knew <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> at an arm the likes of which you see only once in a lifetime." [...] Feller was assigned to the Fargo-Moorhead Twins and was to report there after finishing the high school semester. Slapnicka was later named general manager of the Indians and transferred Feller's contract from Fargo-Moorhead to the New Orleans Pelicans. He was planning to add Feller, along with outfielder Tommy Henrich, to the major league roster after a few exhibition and semi-pro games without visiting either farm club. By doing so, the Indians would be in violation of Major League Baseball's rule stating that, at the time, only minor league teams could sign amateur baseball players to contracts. After a three-month investigation, concluding in December 1936, about whether the Indians broke any Major League Baseball rules by signing Feller, Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis disagreed with the argument presented by Slapnicka and Indians president Alva Bradley, but awarded both Feller and Henrich free agency and required the club to pay a $7,500 fine. Landis made the decision partly due to the testimony of Feller and his father, who wanted his son to play for Cleveland and who had also told Landis he would take the issue to court. Feller elected to remain with the Indians but Henrich joined the New York Yankees. Sports columnist Joe Williams wrote, [...] "For $7500 the Cleveland Indians received $500,000 worth of publicity. ... I feel pretty sure Mr. Alva Bradley, president of the Indians, will admit this is the cheapest investment he ever made in publicity." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{preparation}} she did for the film, actor Aishwarya Rai {{said in an interview}} that both herself and the director Bhansali [...] ".. just like to walk randomly around the sets and [...] "feel". Sometimes I sit quietly and gaze into space or the ground and he captures all that. In fact, the poster picture with me looking away was taken like <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> at the ground, lost in deep thought and he clicked it and told me that he was putting it on his poster. He knows when I am ready to do a scene, when I am in character, and the like. For instance, I delayed going on the set by two days and he did not say anything. He called me on the set and said we would start shooting in five days. On the second day, I tried hair, make-up, and costume. He told me I was ready to give my first shot and indeed, I was." [...] About the script Bhansali said that he had worked on the script for 18 months and says, [...] "My film is mainstream in terms of budgets, cast and audience and I had to make sure that I did not hurt anyone but evoked a debate." [...] He points out that without star-clout, such themes will not make any impact on the audience or society. [...] "And at least till my screenplay reaches the interval point, I do not start casting my actors." ...|$|E

But I knew she was girl because of her breasts, which were empty. She was I suppose, oh I don't know, twenty four, twenty five, and we talked, and she was, you know, so excited and thrilled, and all around us there were mountains of dead people, I mean mountains of them, and they were slushy, and they were slimy, so when you walked through them ... or walked - you tried not to, but it was like .... well you just walked through them, and she ... there was a very nice British MP, and he said 'Don't have any more, come away, come away sir, if you don't mind, because they've all got typhoid and you'll get it, you shouldn't be here swanning-around' and she saw {{in the back of the}} jeep, the unexpired portion of the daily ration, wrapped in a piece of the Daily Mirror, and she said could she have it, and he" [...] "said 'Don't give her food, because they eat it immediately and they die, within ten minutes', but she didn't want the food, she wanted the piece of Daily Mirror - she hadn't seen newsprint for about eight years or five years, whatever it was she had been in the camp for. ... she was Estonian. ... that's all she wanted.
