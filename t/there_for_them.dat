To lighten their loads, the Martin Company cut the luggage allowance to 10 pounds (4.5 kg) per person, discarding clothing and blankets that soon would be desperately needed.|$|E

25|$|In 1922 Krishnamurti and Nitya {{travelled}} from Sydney to California. In California {{they stayed}} at a cottage in the Ojai Valley. It {{was thought that}} the area's climate would be beneficial to Nitya, who {{had been diagnosed with}} tuberculosis. Nitya's failing health became a concern for Krishnamurti. At Ojai they met Rosalind Williams, a young American who became close to them both, and who was later to {{play a significant role in}} Krishnamurti's life. For the first time the brothers were without immediate supervision by their Theosophical Society minders. They found the Valley to be very agreeable. Eventually a trust, formed by supporters, bought a cottage and surrounding property <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> This became Krishnamurti's official residence.|$|E

500|$|The lyrics, {{according}} to Brown are about relationships, {{and to be}} there for each other. That it does not matter to say merely that you love them, the only thing that they care is that their lover give his promise that he will be <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> whenever they need him. In [...] "Say You'll Be There", the group exuded a brash confidence that was attractive to their teenage and young adult fans. The Spice Girls decide to be friends, not lovers, the clear message is that the relationship can be channelled and controlled by the girl, with an emphasis on stating where they come from and what they stand for.|$|E

Hall said that [...] "We [...] attach identities to people, saying, 'It’s too late to reach this person,' or 'This person here, there’s still some good there, so we should try on this one,' or 'This one’s a lost cause, we just need {{to get him out of}} here'. That’s a scary place to live if you’re that person — if you didn’t make the church’s 'list'".|$|E

500|$|Diodorus {{suggests}} that there were 1,000 Lacedemonians and 3,000 other Peloponnesians, totalling 4,000. Herodotus agrees with this figure in one passage, quoting an inscription by Simonides saying there were 4,000 Peloponnesians. However, elsewhere, in the passage summarized by the above table, Herodotus tallies 3,100 Peloponnesians at Thermopylae before the battle. Herodotus also reports that at Xerxes' public showing of the dead, [...] "helots were also <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to see", {{but he does not}} say how many or in what capacity they served. Thus, the difference between his two figures can be squared by supposing (without proof) that there were 900 helots (three per Spartan) present at the battle. If helots were present at the battle, {{there is no reason to}} doubt that they served in their traditional role as armed retainers to individual Spartans. Alternatively, Herodotus' [...] "missing" [...] 900 troops might have been Perioeci, and could therefore correspond to Diodorus' 1,000 Lacedemonians.|$|E
500|$|Weston persuaded Dorsey to {{audition}} {{the group in}} 1938, and the eight drove together to New York City. Dorsey liked them and signed them for ten weeks. After their second broadcast, the sponsorvisiting from overseasheard the group sing [...] "Hold Tight (Want Some Seafood Mama)". Until this point, the sponsor knew only that he was paying for Dorsey's program and that its ratings were very good; transcription discs mailed {{to him by his}} advertising agency always arrived broken. He thought that the performance was terrible, and pressured the advertising agency representing his brand to fire the group. They stayed in New York for several months, landing one job that paid them $3.60 each, and they recorded some material for RCA Victor Records. Weston later said that he and Stordahl felt responsibility for the group, since Weston had arranged their audition with Dorsey. After six months in New York and with no work <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> The Pied Pipers returned to Los Angeles, where four of their members left the group to seek regular employment. Shortly afterwards, Stafford received a telephone call from Dorsey, who told her he wished to hire the group, but wanted only four of them, including Stafford. After she agreed to the offer the remaining Pied PipersStafford, Huddleston, Lowry and Wilsontraveled to Chicago in 1939. The decision led to success for the group, especially Stafford, who featured in both collective and solo performances with Dorsey's orchestra.|$|E

She is a firm, but fun and caring mother who, despite the antics of her {{children}}, is always <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> She halted her studies to raise her family, but decided once the children were older to continue studying law. Before that, she briefly worked as Raven's English teacher at the request of Raven's school principal. Her catchphrase is [...] "Momma like!"

In season 4, Tanya is not present, saying that she went off to England to attend law school. On Cory in the House, she is still in England and she did not visit Cory and Victor but is mentioned. In the pilot episode of Raven's Home, it is revealed by Booker that Tanya is still living.|$|E

The elderly lady did not travel in the same compartment, and they did not notice what became of her on reaching the London terminus. Mrs. Clements secured respectable lodgings in a quiet neighbourhood, and then wrote, as she had engaged to do, to inform Lady Glyde of the address.|$|E
