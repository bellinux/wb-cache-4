5|$|On July 19, after a 21 at-bat hitless streak, Bonds hit 2 home runs, numbers 752 and 753, {{against the}} Chicago Cubs. He went 3–3 with 2 home runs, 6 RBIs, and {{a walk on}} that day. The {{struggling}} last place Giants still lost the game, 9–8. On July 27, Bonds hit home run 754 against Florida Marlins pitcher Rick VandenHurk. Bonds was then walked his next 4 at-bats in the game, but a 2-run shot helped the Giants win the game 12–10. It marked <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> had hit #747 that Bonds had homered in a game the Giants won. On August 4, Bonds hit a 382foot(116m) home run against Clay Hensley of the San Diego Padres for home run number 755, tying Hank Aaron's all-time record. Bonds greeted his son, Nikolai, with an extended bear hug after crossing home plate. Bonds greeted his teammates and then his wife, Liz Watson, and daughter Aisha Lynn behind the backstop. Hensley was the 445th different pitcher {{to give up a}} home run to Bonds. Ironically, given the cloud of suspicion that surrounded Bonds, the tying home run was hit off a pitcher who had been suspended by baseball in 2005 for steroid use. He was walked in his next at bat and eventually scored on a fielder's choice.|$|E

25|$|Back in England, van der Stok {{rejoined the}} RAF and was posted to No.91 Squadron, {{going on to}} fight in Operation Overlord and the anti-V-1 fighter {{aircraft}} sweeps along the Low Countries coast. The following year, he joined No.74 Squadron {{for a brief time}} before, being appointed in March 1945 to the command of the Dutch RAF No.322 Squadron, based in the Netherlands, where, coming into contact with his family for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> had left the Netherlands in 1940, he learned to his horror that his two brothers had been killed in concentration camps and his father had been blinded by the Gestapo.|$|E
25|$|A casual {{interest}} in learning to paint led Marsh, in 1921, to begin taking classes at the Art Students League of New York, where his first teacher was John Sloan. By 1923 Marsh began to paint seriously. In 1925 Marsh visited Paris for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> had lived there {{as a child and}} {{he fell in love with}} what the city had to offer him. Although Marsh had appreciated the drawings of Raphael, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo since he was a child—his father's studio was full of reproductions of the old masters' work—the famous paintings that he saw at the Louvre and other museums stimulated in him a new fascination with the old masters.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after {{learning}} of his year-long lifespan from symptoms similar to Werner syndrome, Snake {{is given a}} mission by Colonel Roy Campbell to assassinate Liquid in the Middle East. Snake infiltrates the area where Liquid's army is camped where he meets Drebin 893, a black market arms dealer, who then injects Snake with nano machines that enable him to use the latest generation of weaponry. When he finally reaches Liquid, Liquid releases a signal that incapacitates Snake and other soldiers in the area equipped with nanomachines, including a patrol led by his old comrade Meryl Silverburgh. As Snake collapses, he sees Dr. Naomi Hunter again for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> infiltrated Shadow Moses.|$|E

25|$|Federer next {{played at}} the Miami Masters. Federer opened {{in the second round}} against {{wildcard}} American Ryan Harrison after taking a bye in the first round. Federer controlled much of the match and avoided a late comeback by Harrison to win in straight sets after a second set tiebreak. He next played perennial rival Andy Roddick in the third round. Federer dropped the first set tiebreak, but came back strong with three break points in the second set. The third set saw Roddick save four break points in the second game and pull momentum from Federer, who gave up a break in the next game. Federer's serve faltered, and Roddick held his next four service games to win the match and defeat Federer for only the third time in his career, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> last defeated Federer at the 2008 Miami Masters. This loss ended Federer's 16-match winning streak.|$|E
25|$|Woods's {{inconsistent}} {{play in the}} 2010 FedEx Cup playoffs {{failed to}} qualify him into the top 30 players for The Tour Championship, for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> turned professional in 1996. He had won the FedEx Cup in 2007 and 2009. He also failed to qualify on points for the 2010 Ryder Cup team, {{for the first time}} in his career. But captain Corey Pavin chose Woods as one of his four captain's picks. Woods, again partnering with Steve Stricker in pairs play, played inconsistently in terrible weather conditions at Celtic Manor in Wales; the matches were delayed several times when the course became unplayable, and the format had to be significantly modified and then even extended to a fourth day to complete the event. The U.S., entering as Cup holders, lost the Cup to the European team, by the narrowest possible margin, 14.5 to 13.5. However, Woods played impressive golf in his final-day singles match, winning decisively over Francesco Molinari.|$|E
25|$|Stefan Leko {{defeated}} Peter Aerts for {{the second}} time on March 30, 2003 at the K-1 World Grand Prix 2003 in Saitama.

In the quarter-finals of the K-1 World Grand Prix 2003 Final on December 6, Aerts went up against Alexey Ignashov. After a close three rounds, the fight was scored a draw and went to an extra round. Aerts was judged the winner unanimously (10-9, 10-9, 10-9) and advanced into the semis for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> won the Grand Prix in 1998. Against Musashi in the second stage was another close decision. This time, however, the judges went in favour of Aerts' opponent and Musashi won a majority decision (30-30, 30-29, 30-29).|$|E
