5|$|Following Japan's {{entry into}} the war, the {{decision}} was made to transfer a large number of Australian troops from <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>to</b> the Pacific region. In early 1942, as the Japanese advanced through the Netherlands East Indies, the majority of the battalion was captured during the Battle of Java. A small number of the battalion's personnel returned to Australia and it was subsequently re-raised in mid-1942. It was later attached to the 6th Division as a corps unit and served in Papua New Guinea during the Aitape–Wewak campaign in 1944–1945. The battalion was disbanded in January 1946.|$|E

5|$|The 3rd Pioneers {{were raised}} in Victoria, in March 1916, from volunteers drawn from Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia and was {{subsequently}} assigned to the 3rd Division. The battalion was formed {{in the aftermath of}} the failed Gallipoli campaign when the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) was expanded as part of plans to transfer it from <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>to</b> Europe for service in the trenches along the Western Front. This expansion saw several new infantry divisions raised in Egypt and Australia, as well as specialist support units such as machine gun companies, engineer companies, artillery batteries and pioneer battalions.|$|E
5|$|The first Tetrarchs were {{delivered}} to the Army in November 1940, and were initially deployed with the 1st Armoured Division (which was being refitted after losing {{the majority of its}} previous tanks during the Battle of France) and the newly formed 6th Armoured Division. However, the faults discovered with the Tetrarch cooling system precluded them from being integrated into units that were sent to <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>to</b> participate in the North African Campaign. Shortly after, all light tanks were discarded from the establishments of British armoured divisions as not suitable for further service.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, Northcott was {{attached}} to the British 7th Armoured Division in <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>to</b> study armoured warfare, returning to Australia in December 1941 to organise the new 1st Armoured Division. In March 1942, he assumed command II Corps. In September 1942, he was appointed Chief of the General Staff. As General Sir Thomas Blamey's principal non-operational subordinate, he was responsible for administering and training the wartime army. After the war, he served as commander of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in the post-war Occupation of Japan. He retired from the Army in 1946 to become the Governor of New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|Herring was {{promoted}} to the temporary rank of major general on 14August1941 {{when he took over}} command of the 6th Division. He returned to Australia with it in March 1942. Unaware that the government had already decided that General Sir Thomas Blamey should be appointed Commander in Chief, Herring, along with Major General George Alan Vasey and Brigadier Clive Steele, approached Army Minister Frank Forde with a proposal that all officers over the age of 50 be immediately retired and Major General Horace Robertson appointed Commander in Chief. The 'revolt of the generals' collapsed with the announcement that General Blamey was returning from <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>to</b> become Commander in Chief, but seems to have done the participants no harm.|$|E
5|$|In early 1940, the {{majority}} of the 6th Division was sent to Palestine, to complete their training before joining the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France. Together with the 7th Division they formed the Australian I Corps. However, France fell to German forces in July 1940, before I Corps arrived. While the rest of the division was training in the Middle East, the division's third artillery regiment, the 2/3rd Field Regiment and the 2/1st Anti-tank Regiment were sent to the United Kingdom to help bolster the garrison there in light of an expected invasion following the Fall of France. After being partially broken up to provide personnel to serve as infantry in the 25th Brigade, once the threat of invasion was over these two regiments were sent to <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>to</b> rejoin the division, arriving there in December 1940.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1942, the {{battalion}} was withdrawn from <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>to</b> help face {{the threat posed}} by the Japanese in the Pacific. A period of garrison duty was undertaken in Ceylon between March and July 1942, before they arrived back in Australia in August 1942. Following this, the 2/6th deployed to New Guinea in January 1943, fighting around Wau and then advancing towards Salamaua during the Salamaua–Lae campaign. They were withdrawn to the Atherton Tablelands for rest in September 1943 and subsequently did not see action again until later in the war, when they were committed to the Aitape–Wewak campaign in late 1944. The 2/6th remained in New Guinea {{until the end of the}} war, and was disbanded in February 1946, after returning to Puckapunyal the previous December.|$|E
5|$|Kanafeh is {{the most}} famed Nabulsi sweet. Originating in Nablus during the 15th century, by 1575, its recipe was {{exported}} throughout the Ottoman Empire — which controlled Palestine at the time. Kanafeh is made of several fine shreds of pastry noodles with honey-sweetened cheese in the center. The top layer of the pastry is usually dyed orange with food coloring and sprinkled with crushed pistachios. Though it is now made throughout <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East,</b> <b>to</b> the present day, kanafeh Nabulsi enjoys continued fame, partly due to its use of a white-brine cheese called jibneh Nabulsi. Boiled sugar {{is used as a}} syrup for kanafeh.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{designated}} {{simply as}} Training Battalion, {{it was under}} the command of Major Francis Voelcker. The battalion was based at Samambula Camp where it would undergo training for the next several months. In May 1941, the bulk of the battalion's personnel returned to New Zealand and onwards to <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>to</b> join the 2nd New Zealand Division. Fourteen soldiers volunteered for duty as coast watchers in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands and consequently left the battalion. Some others, including Voelcker who had been promoted to lieutenant colonel, remained in Fiji to form the cadre around which the battalion was to be reformed with newly arrived personnel. The battalion, now known as Reserve Battalion, resumed training and garrison duty. Many personnel had only received minimal military training in New Zealand before being shipped to Fiji and much time had to be spent on the basics of warfare and tactics.|$|E

5|$|Ranked colonel at the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, Sturdee was raised to lieutenant general in 1940 and became Chief of the General Staff. He proceeded to conduct a doomed defence of the islands to the north of Australia against the advancing Japanese forces. In 1942, he successfully advised the government to divert the Second Australian Imperial Force troops returning from <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>to</b> Australia. He then became head of the Australian Military Mission to Washington, D.C., where he represented Australia before the Combined Chiefs of Staff. As commander of the First Army in New Guinea in 1944–45, Sturdee directed the fighting at Aitape, and on New Britain and Bougainville. He was charged with destroying the enemy when opportunity presented itself, but had to do so with limited resources, and without committing his troops to battles that were beyond their strength.|$|E
5|$|The AIF {{initially}} {{consisted of}} one infantry division and one light horse brigade. The first contingent departed Australia by ship for Egypt on 1 November 1914, where it formed {{part of the}} Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC). The infantry division fought during the Gallipoli Campaign between April and December 1915, reinforced by a second division which was later raised, as well as three light horse brigades. After being evacuated to Egypt the AIF was expanded to five infantry divisions, forming part of the I and II ANZAC Corps, which were committed to the fighting in France and Belgium along the Western Front in March 1916. Meanwhile, two mounted divisions remained in <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>to</b> fight against Turkish forces in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign.|$|E
5|$|The Norfolk Regiment {{was one of}} {{the first}} to enter combat after the {{declaration}} of the First World War. The 1st battalion was stationed in Belfast, from where they were dispatched to France as part of the British Expeditionary Force.

The 2nd battalion, based in India, sailed for <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>to</b> fight against the Ottoman Empire in Mesopotamia (Iraq). The Norfolks had a third battalion, part of the Territorial Force, which was first deployed for home defence around eastern England, and raised three more pals battalions. Norwich, the county town, raised another three companies of Royal Engineers. Approximately 33,000 men served overseas with the Norfolks, though many more Norfolk men joined other regiments.|$|E

50|$|As the Christian {{religion}} {{spread throughout}} the Roman and Persian Empires, it took root in <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East,</b> and cities such as Alexandria and Edessa became important centers of Christian scholarship.
