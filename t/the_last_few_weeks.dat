5|$|Henry was Catherine's {{favourite}} son. Unlike his brothers, {{he came to}} {{the throne}} as a grown man. He was also healthier, though he suffered from weak lungs and constant fatigue. His interest in the tasks of government, however, proved fitful. He depended on Catherine and her team of secretaries until <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of her life.

Many locals interpreted this as coming true when as the hearse carrying his coffin drew up to the churchyard, the horses stepped out of their harness shafts. His body was subsequently buried in the church's graveyard, whilst his abandoned house gradually became dilapidated before falling down.|$|E

5|$|In {{his first}} full season with Lewes, Wormull was used {{in a number of}} {{different}} positions, but in 2007–08, he usually played in central midfield, and felt that the continuity helped his performance. He scored the winning goal against Sutton United in the third qualifying round of the FA Cup, and made an assist for one goal and was involved in the second in the fourth qualifying round, to take the club through to the first round proper for the second year running. Wormull contributed five goals from midfield towards his club winning the Conference South title, though an injured ankle meant he missed <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of the season.|$|E

5|$|Consistent {{performances}} in the County Championship helped Somerset remain challengers for the competition until <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of the season, but the batting-friendly pitch at their home ground, the County Ground, Taunton, meant that the county finished with too many draws to claim their first Championship title. Consistency was also key for Somerset's success in one-day cricket, where they remained unbeaten in the group stage of the Friends Provident Trophy, but were eliminated in the first knock-out round, and finished runners-up by {{one point in the}} NatWest Pro40. In the Twenty20 Cup, Somerset finished as losing finalists. This meant that they qualified for the Champions League Twenty20, where they progressed into the second group stage of the competition. They failed to win any matches in that phase of the competition, resulting in their elimination.|$|E

He finished the season with ten league goals. In 2005–06, Dickov found it hard to retain a regular place in the side, with manager Mark Hughes having signed forwards Craig Bellamy and Shefki Kuqi during the summer. A red card against West Ham United caused him to miss most of the first month of the season. He had a run of first team games in the autumn but starting appearances became fewer as the season progressed. He left the club in the summer of 2006 following the expiry of his contract.|$|E
5|$|In June 1918, Whittle {{was posted}} to the 2nd Army Central School for a five-week stint.

Evacuated to England, he was admitted to the Central Military Hospital, Eastbourne, before transferring to the 3rd Australian Auxiliary Hospital, Dartford, two weeks later. During this time, Billy Hughes, as Prime Minister of Australia, invited several of Australia's Victoria Cross recipients of the war to return to Australia and assist in a recruiting drive; Whittle was among a group of ten who accepted the offer. The party embarked aboard HMAT Medic on 24 August, bound for Melbourne. Arriving seven weeks later, Whittle returned to Tasmania and assisted with recruiting on the island during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of the war.

During <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> couple <b>weeks</b> of her stay, she developed a relationship with Arturo, which some considered to be a downturn to her popularity as she was considered a contender to win following Indhira's ejection.

5|$|In 1943 Serong {{served as}} General Staff Officer 2 with the {{combined}} 6th and 7th Divisions on the Atherton Tableland in Far North Queensland, {{where they were}} resting and retraining prior to conducting further operations. In early 1944 he instructed on the staff course at Cabarlah. That August, he moved to Aitape {{to prepare for the}} deployment of the 6th Division. He was later attached to American forces for the landing on Morotai Island in the Netherlands East Indies in mid-September 1944. In <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of the war, Serong was mentioned in despatches for his actions fighting the Japanese at Wewak, whilst serving with the infantry in the 35th Battalion. During an incident on 21 July 1945, he commanded a force of three platoons and native police on a patrol to destroy a Japanese ammunition dump. Although serving more time in training roles than in combat, during the war Serong had made important contacts with whom he would later work in future postings, including Colonel Reg Pollard, who went on to become Chief of the General Staff (CGS), and Colonel Charles Spry, later the Director of Military Intelligence and the Director General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO).|$|E
5|$|Redknapp's time at West Ham was {{notable for}} the {{turnover}} of players {{during his tenure}} and for the level of attractive football and success which had not been seen since the managership of John Lyall. Over 134 players passed through the club while he was manager, producing a net transfer fee deficit of £16 million, despite the £18 million sale of Rio Ferdinand to Leeds United. Some were notably successful, such as the signings of Stuart Pearce, Trevor Sinclair, Paolo Di Canio, John Hartson, Eyal Berkovic and Ian Wright. Meanwhile, some were expensive, international players who failed at West Ham, such as Florin Raducioiu; Davor Šuker, who earned as much in wages as the revenue gained from one entire stand and yet made only eight appearances; Christian Bassila, who cost £720,000 and played only 86 minutes of football; Titi Camara; Gary Charles, whose wages amounted to £4.4 million but made only three starts for the club; Rigobert Song; Paulo Futre; and Marco Boogers, a player often quoted {{as one of the}} biggest failures in the Premier League. His first season in charge saw West Ham fighting the threat of relegation until <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> while his third season would also see another relegation battle. Always willing to enter the transfer market, Redknapp bought in the winter transfer window John Hartson and Paul Kitson who added the impetus needed at the season's end.|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} to the classical music that the choral department focuses on throughout the year, the choral students of SME always ended their academic year with an extravagant production entitled Blue Moon. It {{has been known to}} last at least three hours. The purpose of Blue Moon was to celebrate the SME choral music program and the commitment to the choir that the students, particularly the seniors, had shown throughout their respective school years and throughout their entire high school careers. The show was rehearsed, put together and performed all within <b>the</b> very <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of school. Each choir performed a group of numbers from a Broadway show complete with costuming, staging, choreography and a pit orchestra. In between each choir's big production were solo and/or ensemble numbers performed by students who had auditioned. With the departure of Tracy Resseguie after the 2007-2008 school year, the tradition of Blue Moon at Shawnee Mission East came to an end. <b>The</b> official <b>last</b> production took place in May 2008.|$|R

We also project the mechanistic hypotheses of several 36 potential drugs including small molecule-based drugs against Ebola virus, which are 37 under development and being tested in animal models or in vitro using various cell types. 38 This paper discusses strategies towards identifying and testing anti-Ebola properties of 39 known and medically approved drugs, especially those that can limit pathologic 40 inflammatory response in Ebola patients and thereby provide protection from mortality. 41 We have underlined the importance of developing combinational therapy for the better 42 treatment outcome of Ebola patients. 43 4...|$|R
