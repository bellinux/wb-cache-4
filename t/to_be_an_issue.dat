5|$|Gardiner's health {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> {{throughout the}} 1934 NHL playoffs. On March 29, 1934 {{in a playoff}} game against the Montreal Maroons Gardiner had a shutout as the Black Hawks won 3–0; though he was named first star as the best player of the game, Gardiner was in extreme pain during the entire game with a fever of 102 Fahrenheit and was attended to by a doctor {{in the dressing room}} during intermissions.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{locating}} Project Y {{with the}} Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago, {{or at the}} Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, was considered, {{but in the end}} it was decided that a remote location would be best. A site in the vicinity of Los Angeles was rejected on security grounds, and one near Reno, Nevada as being too inaccessible. On Oppenheimer's recommendation, the search was narrowed to the vicinity of Albuquerque, New Mexico, where Oppenheimer owned a ranch in the Sangre de Cristo Range. The climate was mild, there were air and rail connections to Albuquerque, it was sufficiently distant from the West Coast of the United States for a Japanese attack not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue,</b> and the population density was low.|$|E

25|$|Some {{problems}} that are expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> in this century, such as fresh water shortages, can alternatively be regarded as problems of energy supply. For example, in desalination stations, seawater can be purified through distillation or reverse osmosis. Nonetheless, these processes are energy intensive. Even if the first fusion stations are not competitive with alternative sources, fusion could still become competitive if large-scale desalination requires more power than the alternatives are able to provide.|$|E

At the time of the incidents, the company said it disclosed all of its breaches to the responsible government agencies and these were resolved to their satisfaction.

25|$|The United States {{remains one}} of the main allies of the country and, through the Taiwan Relations Act passed in 1979, has {{continued}} selling arms and providing military training to the Armed Forces. This situation continues <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> for the People's Republic of China which considers US involvement disruptive to the stability of the region. In January 2010, the Obama administration announced its intention to sell $6.4 billion worth of military hardware to Taiwan. As a consequence, the PRC threatened the US with economic sanctions and warned that their co-operation on international and regional issues could suffer.|$|E

25|$|Some {{critics argue}} {{that the lack of}} results arising from this {{investigation}} is the result of systemic racism. This was also believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> in the case of Vancouver's missing women and the Robert Pickton murders. The issue of systemic racism in these cases is explored in Finding Dawn, the 2006 documentary by Christine Welsh whose film includes a section on the Highway of Tears victim Ramona Wilson, including interviews with family and community members. Often overlooked in reports on the Highway of Tears is the fact that over half of the missing women are First Nation.|$|E
25|$|The {{calendar}} saw {{the introduction}} of the Russian Grand Prix with the race staged at the Sochi Autodrom {{near the end of the}} season. The race took place on a street circuit constructed around the Sochi Olympic Park. It was the first Russian Grand Prix in a century, and the first time the country had ever hosted a round of the Formula One World Championship. The International Olympic Committee had cautioned that it would use its power to delay the race until 2015 if it felt that construction of the circuit and facilities were disrupting preparations for the 2014 Winter Olympic Games, but this proved not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} {{problems}} with sexual functioning mentioned by participants in this study, the most common problems listed for males were experiencing anxiety about performing sexually (81.4%) and premature ejaculation (74.4%). Other common problems included issues becoming erect and difficulties with ejaculation. Generally, most problems were not experienced on a chronic basis. Common problems for girls included difficulties with sexual climax (orgasm) (86.7%), not feeling sexually interested during a sexual situation (81.2%), unsatisfactory vaginal lubrication (75.8%) anxiety about performing sexually (75.8%) and painful intercourse (25.8%). Most problems listed by the girls were not persistent problems. However, inability to experience orgasm seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> that was persistent for some participants.|$|E

25|$|An issue {{likely to}} come into play will be a {{provision}} in the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-134), which places a US$200 million cap on the aggregate of all passengers' damage claims in a railroad accident against a passenger railroad, including punitive damages. Bloomberg News reported that this event would likely be the first legal test of this law, according to a former House rail committee staffer who helped write the law, who predicted that given the number of casualties, the cap is almost certainly going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> in pending litigation. An attorney representing two of the victims agreed, saying payouts could range from $5 million to $10 million per death or serious injury. Metrolink reportedly has insurance coverage totaling $150 million.|$|E
25|$|As an {{alternative}} to taking prescription drugs, some evidence shows that an average person seeking short-term help may find relief by taking over-the-counter antihistamines such as diphenhydramine or doxylamine. Diphenhydramine and doxylamine are widely used in nonprescription sleep aids. They are the most effective over-the-counter sedatives currently available, at least in much of Europe, and in Canada, Australia, and the United States, and are more sedating than some prescription hypnotics. Antihistamine effectiveness for sleep may decrease over time, and anticholinergic side-effects (such as dry mouth) {{may also be a}} drawback with these particular drugs. While addiction does not seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> with this class of drugs, they can induce dependence and rebound effects upon abrupt cessation of use. However, people whose insomnia is caused by restless legs syndrome may have worsened symptoms with antihistamines.|$|E
25|$|Affiliates {{discussed}} {{the issues in}} Internet forums and began to organize their efforts. They believed {{that the best way}} to address the problem was to discourage merchants from advertising via adware. Merchants that were either indifferent to or supportive of adware were exposed by affiliates, thus damaging those merchants' reputations and tarnishing their affiliate marketing efforts. Many affiliates either terminated the use of such merchants or switched to a competitor's affiliate program. Eventually, affiliate networks were also forced by merchants and affiliates to take a stand and ban certain adware publishers from their network. The result was Code of Conduct by Commission Junction/beFree and Performics, LinkShare's Anti-Predatory Advertising Addendum, and ShareASale's complete ban of software applications as a medium for affiliates to promote advertiser offers. Regardless of the progress made, adware continues <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue,</b> as demonstrated by the class action lawsuit against ValueClick and its daughter company Commission Junction filed on April 20, 2007.|$|E
