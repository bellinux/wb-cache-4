This initial report found that based on indirect and incomplete evidence available at the time, there was inadequate evidence to accept or reject a thiomersal-autism link, though it was biologically plausible.|$|E
5|$|Galaxies have {{magnetic}} fields of their own. They {{are strong enough}} to be dynamically important: they drive mass inflow into <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> of galaxies, they modify the formation of spiral arms and they can affect the rotation of gas in the outer regions of galaxies. Magnetic fields provide the transport of angular momentum required for the collapse of gas clouds and hence the formation of new stars.|$|E

5|$|The {{high-resolution}} spectra {{and images}} {{provided by the}} HST have been especially well-suited to establishing the prevalence of black holes in the nuclei of nearby galaxies. While it had been hypothesized in the early 1960s that black holes would be found at <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> of some galaxies, and astronomers in the 1980s {{identified a number of}} good black hole candidates, work conducted with Hubble shows that black holes are probably common to <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> of all galaxies. The Hubble programs further established that the masses of the nuclear black holes and properties of the galaxies are closely related. The legacy of the Hubble programs on black holes in galaxies is thus to demonstrate a deep connection between galaxies and their central black holes.|$|E
