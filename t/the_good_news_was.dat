5|$|July 18–20, 2015: The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Dolores brought scattered showers and thunderstorms throughout Southern California, breaking many rainfall records and causing flooding. One such flash flood caused {{a bridge to}} collapse which shut down Interstate 10 between Indio and Blythe, effectively shutting off the primary Phoenix-to-Los-Angeles route. <b>The</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>was</b> that the rain helped firefighters contain the North Fire within 3 days.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{played in}} the World Series two years earlier, the 1986 Padres {{finished}} in fourth place in the National League West with a disappointing record of 74–88. The speculation that Boros would be fired proved accurate, as he was replaced by Larry Bowa on October 24, 1986. Boros said at the time, [...] "I was prepared {{for the fact that}} I wouldn't be coming back. ... It's like the good news and bad news joke. <b>The</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>was</b> {{that at the end of}} the season I hadn't been fired. The bad news was I hadn't been rehired." ...|$|E

They could scarcely believe <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>was</b> true, {{even when the}} kindly old gentleman, with tears in his eyes, congratulated the young couple on the fortune in store for them.

60|$|De Lescure only {{remained}} {{three days}} at Durbellière, {{and then started}} again for his own house at Clisson, and Henri accompanied him. They had both been occupied during these three days in making such accommodation as was in their power for the sick and wounded, who were brought back into the Bocage in considerable numbers from Saumur. The safe and sound and whole of limb travelled faster {{than those who had}} lost arms and legs in the trenches at Varin, or who had received cuts and slashes and broken ribs at the bridge of Fouchard, and therefore <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>was</b> first received in the Bocage; but those miserable accompaniments of victory, low tumbrils, laden with groaning sufferers lying on straw, slowly moving carts, every motion of which opened anew the wounds of their wretched occupants, and every species of vehicle as could be collected through the country, crammed with the wounded and the dying, and some even with the dead, were not long in following the triumphal return of the victorious peasants.|$|E
