The importance of the sea to maritime nations is shown by the intrusions it makes into their culture; its inclusion in myth and legend; its mention in proverbs and folk song; the use of ships in votive offerings; the importance of ships and the sea in initiation ceremonies and in mortuary rites; children playing with toy boats; adults making model ships; crowds gathering at the launch of a new ship; people congregating at the arrival or departure of a vessel and the general attitude towards maritime matters. <b>Trade</b> <b>and</b> <b>exchange</b> of ideas with neighbouring nations is one of the means by which civilizations advance and evolve.

40|$|The paper {{assess the}} {{relative}} importance of <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> liberalization, infrastructure availability and economic and political stability in increasing Middle East and North African (MENA) countries attractiveness with respect to FDI. The analysis is conducted for total FDI and for FDI in manufacturing. The results show that <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> liberalization, infrastructure availability and sound economic and political conditions increase FDI inflows. Their effects are much higher for FDI in the manufacturing sector than for total FDI. This result is robust to alternative indicators of <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> liberalization, <b>and</b> to change in the specification. The message to MENA’s policy makers is twofold. First, efforts toward <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> liberalization should be initiated or further increased {{in order to make the}} region attractive to foreign investors. Second improvements in other aspects of the investment climate are important complements to liberalization and result in additional and sensitive increase of FDI inflows. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
