5|$|The fourth {{mission in}} the World Heritage Site, the mission of Concepción, was {{initially}} founded in 1699 by the Jesuit priests Fr. Francisco Lucas Caballero and Fr. Francisco Hervás. A nearby mission, San Ignacio de Boococas, was incorporated in 1708. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> moved three times: in 1707, 1708 and 1722. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> inhabited by the Chiquitanos, the largest tribe in the region. The mission church was constructed between 1752 and 1756, by Fr. Martin Schmid and Fr. Johann Messner. From 1975 to 1996 <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> reconstructed as part of Hans Roth's restoration project.|$|E

5|$|He {{also sent}} a {{diplomatic}} mission to Europe (1450), asking for skilled labour. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> {{led by a}} Sicilian, Pietro Rombulo, who had previously been successful in a mission to India. Rombulo first visited Pope Nicholas V, but his ultimate goal was the court of Alfonso V of Aragon, who responded favorably.|$|E

50|$|In 1902, <b>the</b> Middle States <b>Mission</b> <b>was</b> {{created with}} Ben E. Rich as {{president}}. However, in 1903, Ephraim H. Nye, president of <b>the</b> Southern States <b>mission,</b> died. He <b>was</b> replaced by Ben E. Rich and {{the boundaries of}} <b>the</b> <b>missions</b> <b>were</b> realigned. In 1904, <b>the</b> Southwestern States <b>Mission</b> <b>was</b> renamed <b>the</b> Central States <b>Mission.</b> After <b>the</b> San Francisco earthquake and fire in 1906, <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> headquarters <b>was</b> relocated to Los Angeles from San Francisco. In {{the next few years}} the headquarters of <b>the</b> Central States <b>Mission</b> <b>were</b> moved to Independence, Missouri, and the headquarters of <b>the</b> Northwestern States <b>Mission</b> <b>were</b> moved to Portland, Oregon.

5|$|In Mission: Earth, Voyage to the Home Planet, {{astronaut}} Thomas David Jones recounts {{his experiences}} studying the Earth {{during his first}} mission with the United States space agency NASA. Jones' space mission lasted eleven days. Jones {{was a member of}} the crew of the Space Shuttle Endeavour, which left Earth in April 1994. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> intended to provide the Space Radar Lab with a view of the planet. By using three separate radar echoes, scientists were able to analyze a full image of the planet. The radar technology could penetrate obstructions, including clouds and thick outgrowth of trees. Another purpose of <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> to analyze the ecological state of the planet and to take measurements of pollution caused by carbon monoxide.|$|E
5|$|In the Apollo11 {{photographic}} record {{there are}} only five images of Armstrong partly shown or reflected. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> planned to the minute, {{with the majority of}} photographic tasks to be performed by Armstrong with a single Hasselblad camera.|$|E

5|$|Operation Turkey Buzzard, {{also known}} as Operation Beggar, was a supply mission to North Africa that took place between March and August 1943. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> {{undertaken}} by the division's glider pilots and No. 295 Squadron Royal Air Force, {{as part of the}} preparations for the Allied invasion of Sicily.|$|E
5|$|Supervision of <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> {{assigned}} to the German Ambassador to Turkey, Hans von Wangenheim, but as he was ill, his functions were delegated to Prince zu Hohenlohe-Langenburg. Following Wangenheim's death in 1915, Count von Wolff-Metternich was designated his successor. He had little contact with the expedition.|$|E

5|$|A {{motion in}} the House to extend Canada's mission in Afghanistan by two years was successful. The motion was {{supported}} by the Conservatives and 30 Liberal MPs, allowing it to narrowly pass 149–145 on May 17, 2006. Even outside of government bills, the Prime Minister's support of Canada's action has been a recurring topic, gaining him both supporters and critics among the Canadian population. On March 13, 2008, <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> further extended until July 2011 by a vote of 197–77, with Conservative and Liberal MPs in favour, and Bloc and NDP MPs opposed.|$|E
5|$|ARVN Brigadier General Vu Van Giai gave Anderson a Ranger {{platoon of}} about 20 men and three M-48 tanks {{that they used}} to set up a forward {{operating}} base along Highway QL-9 within observation range of the strategic Cam Lo Bridge. But Giai thought that <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> insane and refused {{to take responsibility for the}} mission once they crossed the Song Meiu Giang. Anderson, who spoke Vietnamese, obtained additional intelligence from the headquarters of the 1st Armor Brigade near Dong Ha.|$|E

5|$|Another {{canceled}} {{proposal to}} orbit Ganymede was the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter. It {{was designed to}} use nuclear fission for power, ion engine propulsion, and would have studied Ganymede in greater detail than previously. However, <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> canceled in 2005 because of budget cuts. Another old proposal was called The Grandeur of Ganymede.|$|E
5|$|Apollo 13's Fra Mauro {{mission was}} reassigned to Apollo 14, {{commanded}} in February 1971 by Mercury veteran Alan Shepard, with Stuart Roosa and Edgar Mitchell. This time <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> successful. Shepard and Mitchell spent 33 hours and 31 {{minutes on the}} surface, and completed two EVAs totalling 9 hours 24 minutes, which was a record for the longest EVA by a lunar crew at the time.|$|E
5|$|During the week, David Ian {{talked to}} the girls about fitness and stamina, and Claire Sweeney advised the singers on looking after {{themselves}} and their voices. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> a fitness test, with Olympic athlete Iwan Thomas, requiring the Marias to complete an assault course.

5|$|In August 2000, NASA asked project {{managers}} to consider {{looking at the}} Space Shuttle, instead of the previously proposed EELV, as a launch vehicle. In late November 2000, NASA announced that the project's scientific team was selected. The group included notable names {{from the world of}} extrasolar planet research including Geoffrey Marcy. The entire group consisted of 10 principal investigators and five mission specialists. At the time of this NASA announcement launch was scheduled for 2009 and <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> still part of the Origins Program.|$|E
5|$|In March, NASA was {{studying}} {{the possibility of}} flying the first Apollo mission as a joint space rendezvous with the final Project Gemini mission, Gemini 12 in November 1966. But by May, delays in making Apollo ready for flight just by itself, and the extra time needed to incorporate compatibility with the Gemini, made that impractical. This became moot when slippage in readiness of the AS-204 spacecraft caused the last-quarter 1966 target date to be missed, and <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> rescheduled for February 21, 1967.|$|E
5|$|No. 351 Squadron flew {{its first}} mission on 13 October 1944; it {{involved}} six aircraft attacking an Axis supply convoy {{near the village}} of Aržano. On 20 October, aircraft from the squadron, supported by Spitfires from No. 352 Squadron, conducted rocket and strafing attacks on enemy columns near Metković that were withdrawing {{in the face of the}} advancing Partisan 26th Dalmatian Division. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> a success, but one aircraft was lost to ground fire.|$|E
