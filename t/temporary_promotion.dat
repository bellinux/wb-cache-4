He formally {{changed his name to}} Wilder-Neligan in October, and remained at Anzac until November, after which the battalion was evacuated to Egypt. During its time in Egypt, the 9th Battalion was stationed for a period on the front line in the desert near the Suez Canal. On one occasion, an Ottoman patrol was seen, and the adventurous Wilder-Neligan asked to be allowed to take out a patrol on camels to cut them off. With certain restrictions, this was permitted, but no contact with the enemy occurred. In March 1916, he relinquished his post of adjutant, and was substantively promoted to captain before the battalion left Alexandria for France and the Western Front {{at the end of the}} month.|$|E
5|$|During the War of 1812, {{in which}} U.S. forces battled the British Empire and its Indian allies, Taylor {{successfully}} defended Fort Harrison in Indiana Territory from an Indian attack commanded by Tecumseh. The September 1812 battle represented the first land {{victory of the}} war for the American forces, and Taylor's leadership received wide praise. He received a brevet (<b>temporary)</b> <b>promotion</b> {{to the rank of}} major; according to Eisenhower, this represented the first brevet ever awarded in United States history. Later that year, Taylor joined General Samuel Hopkins as an aide on two expeditions: the first into the Illinois Territory and the second to the Tippecanoe battle site, where they were forced to retreat in the Battle of Wild Cat Creek. Taylor moved his growing family to Fort Knox after the violence subsided. In spring 1814, he was called back into action under Brigadier General Benjamin Howard. After Howard fell sick, Taylor led a 430-man expedition from St. Louis, Missouri up the Mississippi River. In the Battle of Credit Island, Taylor defeated Indian forces, but retreated after the Indians were joined by their British allies. That October he supervised the construction of Fort Johnson near present-day Warsaw, Illinois, the last toehold of the U.S. Army in the upper Mississippi River Valley. Upon Howard's death a few weeks later, Taylor was ordered to abandon the fort and retreat to St. Louis. Reduced to the rank of captain when the war ended in 1815, he resigned from the army. He re-entered it a year later after gaining a commission as a major.|$|E

50|$|There is a {{reversion}} in rank {{after an}} officer has been temporarily promoted {{to a higher}} rank while occupying a position requiring that rank; the officer reverts to the permanent rank on vacating the position bearing the higher rank. In the US military this occurs most often to three- or four-star general or flag officers, who can be reduced in rank to no lower than their permanent rank of two stars. This occurs because three- and four-star ranks are always temporary ranks and are linked to their position's office. A three- or four-star officer could revert non-punitively to a lower rank because they no longer hold a position bearing the higher rank. Reversion of this type is less usual for lower US ranks as such <b>temporary</b> <b>promotions</b> are uncommon.|$|R

Major General William Howe, commanding the British forces in New York, drafted a plan for 1777 in which the primary goal was the taking of the rebel capital, Philadelphia. [...] Troops left to defend New York were to include a brigade of 3,000 provincial troops under the command of the former royal governor of New York, William Tryon, who was given a <b>temporary</b> <b>promotion</b> as [...] "major general of the provincials" [...] in spring 1777.

2500|$|In 1923 Secretary of the Treasury Andrew W.

40|$|Prices for grocery items differ across {{stores and}} {{time because of}} {{promotion}} periods. Consumers therefore {{have an incentive to}} search for the lowest price. When a product is purchased infrequently though, the hassle of checking the price on every shopping trip might outweigh the benefit of spending less. I propose a structural model for storable goods, that takes inventory holdings and search into account. The model is estimated using data on laundry detergent purchases. I find that search costs play a large role in explaining purchase behavior, with a large proportion of consumers not being aware of the price of detergent in a given time period. Trip characteristics such as the amount of money spent on other items and the number of products purchased in the same product category cause the search cost to vary across shopping trips. I also compute between-store price elasticities and find that <b>temporary</b> <b>promotions</b> have little impact on competing stores. There is no post-promotion dip in sales. Permanent price reductions lead to a significant shift in market share towards the store that lowered its price. The adjustment of market shares is almost immediate. ...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the huge}} amount of money {{allocated}} every year to sales promotions, brand managers {{still do not know}} how often and in what circumstances promotions are truly effective. This dissertation proposes an approach that allows managers {{to assess the impact of}} individual promotion events rather than the average effect of total promotional efforts. As such, more detailed information is gained on how promotions should be implemented. Moreover, sales promotions are not only evaluated in a business-as-usual environment, but their role and effectiveness during retailer induced price wars is also critically examined. As retailer competition tends to degenerate more often into price wars, this research offers recommendations to brand managers on whether they should accommodate retailers’ wishes to lower regular, list prices rather than focusing on <b>temporary</b> <b>promotions.</b> Finally, a brand manufacturer, when planning his promotional events for a retailer, should consider that a promotion can steal sales from rival supermarket chains. While these cross-chain effects are often negligible for the retailer, they are quite substantial for the manufacturer. Thus, to increase promotional effectiveness, a brand manager should carefully plan the promotional calendar across rival retailers...|$|R
