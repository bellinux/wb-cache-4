40|$|Objectives: Head {{and neck}} cancer {{patients}} who have lost facial parts following surgical intervention frequently require craniofacial implant retained facial prostheses for restoration. Many craniofacial implant patients require computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans {{as part of their}} long-term follow-up care. Consequently removal of implant superstructures and peri-abutment tissue management is required for those studies. The purpose of the present paper was to describe a method for eliminating cranial imaging artifacts in patients with craniofacial implants. Material and Methods: Three patients wearing extraoral implant retained facial prostheses needing either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging studies were discussed. Peri-implant soft tissues contracture after removal of percutaneous craniofacial implant abutments during computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging studies was prevented using a method proposed by authors. The procedure involves temporary removal of the supra-implant components prior to imaging and filling of the <b>tissue</b> <b>openings</b> with polyvinyl siloxane dental impression material. Results: Immediately after filling of the <b>tissue</b> <b>openings</b> with polyvinyl siloxane dental impression material patients were sent for the imaging studies, and were asked to return for removal of the silicone plugs and reconnection of all superstructure hardware after imaging procedures were complete. The silicone plugs were easily removed with a dental explorer. The percutaneous abutments were immediately replaced and screwed into the implants which were at the bone level. Conclusions: Presented herein method eliminates the source of artifacts and prevents contracture of percutaneous tissues upon removal of the implant abutments during imaging...|$|R

This study was designed to investigate the involvement of BK(C) (a) channels in endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxation of human intracavernous penile arteries. In human intracavernous arteries obtained in connection with transsexual operations, change of isometric force was recorded in microvascular myographs and endothelium-dependent (nitric oxide (NO) and endothelium-derived hyperpolarization (EDH) -type) and -independent (NO-donor) relaxation was measured in contracted arteries. In penile small arteries contracted with phenylephrine, acetylcholine evoked NO- and EDH-type relaxations which were sensitive to iberiotoxin, a selective blocker of BK(C) (a) channels. Iberiotoxin also inhibited relaxations induced by a NO donor, sodium nitroprusside. NS 11021, a selective opener of BK(C) (a) channels, evoked pronounced relaxations which were inhibited in the presence of iberiotoxin. NS 13558, a BK(C) (a) inactive analogue of NS 11021, failed to relax human penile small arteries. Our results show that BK(C) (a) channels are involved in both NO- and EDH-type relaxation of intracavernous penile arteries obtained from healthy men. The effect of a selective opener of BK(C) (a) channels also suggests that direct activation of the channel may be an advantageous approach for treatment of impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation often associated with erectile dysfunction...|$|E

Here, we investigated the presence of neoangiogenesis in AKU synovium and healthy controls. Synovium from AKU patients, who had undergone total joint replacement or arthroscopy, or from healthy patients without any history of rheumatic diseases, who underwent surgical operation following sport trauma was subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining. Histologic grades were assigned for clinical disease activity and synovitis based on cellular content of the synovium. By immunofluorescence microscopy, using different endothelial cell markers, we observed large vascularization in AKU but not in healthy synovium. Moreover, Western blotting and quantification analyses confirmed strong expression of endothelial cell markers in AKU synovial tissues. Importantly, AKU synovium vascular endothelium expressed high levels of β-dystroglycan, a protein previously involved in the regulation of angiogenesis in osteoarthritic synovium.

These facts closely link brain levels of α-synuclein with the risk of PD, and make lowering α-synuclein levels a therapeutic strategy {{for the treatment of}} PD and related synucleinopathies. In this paper, we corroborate previous findings on the ability of overexpressed Polo-like kinase 2 (PLK- 2) to decrease cellular α-synuclein, but demonstrate that the process is independent of PLK- 2 phosphorylating S 129 in α-synuclein because a similar reduction is achieved with the non-phosphorable S 129 A mutant α-synuclein. Using a specific PLK- 2 inhibitor (compound 37), we demonstrate that endogenous PLK- 2 phosphorylates S 129 only in some cells, but increases α-synuclein protein levels in all tested cell cultures and brain slices. PLK- 2 is found to regulate the transcription of α-synuclein mRNA from both the endogenous mouse SNCA gene and transgenic vectors that only contain the open reading frame. Moreover, we are the first to show that regulation of α-synuclein by PLK- 2 is of physiological importance since 10 days' inhibition of endogenous PLK- 2 in wt C 57 BL/ 6 mice increases endogenous α-synuclein protein levels. Our findings collectively demonstrate that PLK- 2 regulates α-synuclein levels by a previously undescribed transcription-based mechanism.

40|$|Hereditary {{inclusion}} body myopathy (HIBM) {{is a rare}} neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in GNE, the key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of sialic acid. While the mechanism leading from GNE mutations to the HIBM phenotype is not yet understood, we searched for proteins potentially interacting with GNE, which could give some insights about novel putative biological functions of GNE in muscle. We used a Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) -Biosensor based assay to search for potential GNE interactors in anion exchanged fractions of human skeletal muscle primary culture cell lysate. Analysis of the positive fractions by in vitro binding assay revealed alpha-actinin 1 as a potential interactor of GNE. The direct interaction of the two proteins was assessed in vitro by SPR-Biosensor based kinetics analysis and in a cellular environment by a co-immunoprecipitation assay in GNE overexpressing 293 T cells. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry on stretched mouse muscle suggest that both GNE and alpha-actinin 1 localize to an overlapping but not identical region of the myofibrillar apparatus centered on the Z line. The interaction of GNE with alpha-actinin 1 might point to its involvement in alpha-actinin mediated processes. In addition these studies illustrate {{for the first time}} the expression of the non-muscle form of alpha-actinin, alpha-actinin 1, in mature skeletal muscle <b>tissue,</b> <b>opening</b> novel avenues for its specific function in the sarcomere. Although no significant difference could be detected in the binding kinetics of alpha-actinin 1 with either wild type or mutant GNE in our SPR biosensor based analysis, further investigation is needed to determine whether and how the interaction of GNE with alpha-actinin 1 in skeletal muscle is relevant to the putative muscle-specific function of alpha-actinin 1, and to the muscle-restricted pathology of HIBM. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Obesity {{promotes}} inflammation in {{adipose tissue}} (AT) {{and this is}} implicated in pathophysiological complications such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Although based on the classical hypothesis, necrotic AT adipocytes (ATA) in obese state activate AT macrophages (ATM) that then lead to a sustained chronic inflammation in AT, the link between human adipocytes {{and the source of}} inflammation in AT has not been in-depth and systematically studied. So we decided as a new hypothesis to investigate human primary adipocytes alone to see whether they are able to prime inflammation in AT. Methods and Results: Using mRNA expression, human preadipocytes and adipocytes express the cytokines/chemokines and their receptors, MHC II molecule genes and 14 acute phase reactants including C-reactive protein. Using multiplex ELISA revealed the expression of 50 cytokine/chemokine proteins by human adipocytes. Upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation, most of these adipocyte-associated cytokines/chemokines and immune cell modulating receptors were up-regulated and a few down-regulated such as (ICAM- 1, VCAM- 1, MCP- 1, IP- 10, IL- 6, IL- 8, TNF-alpha and TNF-beta highly up-regulated and IL- 2, IL- 7, IL- 10, IL- 13 and VEGF down-regulated. In migration assay, human adipocyte-derived chemokines attracted significantly more CD 4 + T cells than controls and the number of migrated CD 4 + cells was doubled after treating the adipocytes with LPS. Neutralizing MCP- 1 effect produced by adipocytes reduced CD 4 + migration by approximately 30 %. Conclusion: Human adipocytes express many cytokines/chemokines that are biologically functional. They are able to induce inflammation and activate CD 4 + cells independent of macrophages. This suggests that the primary event in the sequence leading to chronic inflammation in AT is metabolic dysfunction in adipocytes, followed by production of immunological mediators by these adipocytes, which is then exacerbated by activated ATM, activation and recruitment of immune cells.

Gaining {{insight into}} mechanisms {{involved in the}} malignant process opens potential therapeutic and preventative interventions. This thesis details work undertaken to investigate one area ofCRC formation, namely the role that cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) has in its development, focussing especially on effects COX- 2 has on tumour angiogenesis. COX- 2 {{has been shown to}} be over-expressed in up to 85 % ofCR~s and 50 % of adenomas. This discovery caused excitement that COX- 2 inhibitors might have roles in the prevention and treatment ofCRC. Further studies have shown that COX- 2 influences malignant transformation at numerous levels, including causing reduced apoptosis, increased invasiveness and promoting angiogenesis. However, questions exist including which cells are responsible for COX- 2 production, what causes COX 2 expression by these cells, and how COX- 2 influences cellular interactions in malignancy. Investigations, predominantly employing flow cytometry, were undertaken on CRC cell lines and disaggregated ex vivo CRC specimens. COX- 2 expression by cell lines was increased by cytokines. The overall rate ofCOX- 2 expression by ex vivo tumour cells was in keeping with that previously reported. However, COX- 2 expression was lost when these cells were cultured for 24 hours, an effect not reversed by previously efficacious cytokines, suggesting expression in vivo is dependent on another form of cellular stimulation, possibly from neighbouring cells. High levels ofCOX- 2 were discovered in paired normal colonic <b>tissue,</b> <b>opening</b> up the potential that certain individuals express COX- 2 prior to cancer development, predisposing to a malignant state; these persons might benefit from COX- 2 inhibitors to prevent metachronous lesions. CRC cell lines were co-cultured with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to investigate COX- 2 dependent effects on angiogenesis. Endothelial cell derived COX- 2 increased cancer cell invasiveness by increasing ICAM-l, an effect reversed by COX- 2 inhibition. COX- 2 inhibition also reduced VEGF production by endothelial cells. Additionally, COX- 2 levels by the two cell types were maintained at steady state, whereby an increase by HUVECs brought about a reciprocal reduction by cancer cells or vice versa.

40|$|L asers in the erbium family (Er:YAG andEr,Cr:YSGG) have {{a diverse}} range of hard and soft tissue {{applications}} in dentistry (Table 1).

The scope of soft tissue applica-tions in dentistry is also broad, since these lasers can be used in many soft tissue procedures, except in patients with bleeding disorders where a long pulse duration is necessary to ensure haemostasis. The erbium lasers are without equal in terms of hard tissue procedures and this unique position reflects the absorption of these lasers in water and in the apatite minerals found in bone and teeth.

40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundVertebrate head {{development}} {{depends on}} a series of interactions between many cell populations of distinct embryological origins. Cranial mesenchymal tissues have a dual embryonic source: - the neural crest (NC), which generates most of craniofacial skeleton, dermis, pericytes, fat cells, and tenocytes; and - the mesoderm, which yields muscles, blood vessel endothelia and some posterior cranial bones. The molecular players that orchestrate co-development of cephalic NC and mesodermal cells to properly construct the head of vertebrates remain poorly understood. In this regard, Six 1 gene, a vertebrate homolog of Drosophila Sine Oculis, is known to be required for development of ear, nose, tongue and cranial skeleton. However, the embryonic origin and fate of Six 1 -expressing cells have remained unclear. In this work, we addressed these issues in the avian embryo model by using quail-chick chimeras, cephalic NC cultures and immunostaining for SIX 1. ResultsOur data show that, at early NC migration stages, SIX 1 is expressed by mesodermal cells but excluded from the NC cells (NCC). Then, SIX 1 becomes widely expressed in NCC that colonize the pre-otic mesenchyme. In contrast, in the branchial arches (BAs), SIX 1 is present only in mesodermal cells that give rise to jaw muscles. At later developmental stages, the distribution of SIX 1 -expressing cells in mesoderm-derived tissues is consistent with a possible role of this factor in the myogenic program of all types of head muscles, including pharyngeal, extraocular and tongue muscles. In NC derivatives, SIX 1 is notably expressed in perichondrium and chondrocytes of the nasal septum and in the sclera, although other facial cartilages such as Meckel’s were negative at the stages considered. Moreover, in cephalic NC cultures, chondrocytes and myofibroblasts, not the neural and melanocytic cells express SIX 1. ConclusionThe present results point to a dynamic tissue-specific expression of SIX 1 in a variety of cephalic NC- and mesoderm-derived cell types and <b>tissues,</b> <b>opening</b> the way for further analysis of Six 1 function in the coordinated development of these two cellular populations during vertebrate head formation...|$|R

40|$|As cancer {{incidence}} {{continues to}} rise in the United States, there remains an increasing demand for new tools for oncologists to use for both diagnosing and directing treatments for cancer. Among these tools, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has been rising in prominence in recent decades as {{a useful tool for}} monitoring the metabolic activity of organs and tissues in vivo. Unlike Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Ultrasound (US), PET imaging allows medical professionals and researchers to use molecular imaging probes to measure metabolic activity of <b>tissues,</b> <b>opening</b> up a different dimension of medical evaluation. In PET imaging for cancer, 2 -deoxy- 2 -[F- 18]fluoro-D-glucose (2 -FDG) has been the historically dominant molecular probe used, since 2 -FDG uptake occurs via facilitative glucose transporters (GLUTs), and its tissue accumulation reflects hexokinase (HK) activity in proportion to the glucose metabolic rate. In many cancers, glucose utilization through these transporters increases dramatically relative to non-cancerous tissue, making 2 -FDG a valuable molecular imaging probe in detecting and monitoring the progression of cancer. However, there are some cancers that don't show consistently increased 2 -FDG uptake, rendering 2 -FDG PET less effective in these situations for medical diagnosis. Recent work has suggested the possibility that another class of glucose transporters, sodium glucose transporters (SGLTs), is expressed and active in a variety of cancers. SGLT activity, which cannot be measured by 2 -FDG PET, could offer an explanation as to why 2 -FDG accumulation seems less significant in some cancers. While there have been several publications examining mRNA and protein SGLT expression in cancer, there has yet to be any data confirming functional SGLT activity in vivo. In this work, we present initial data on the functional activity of SGLTs in cancerous cells from both prostate and pancreatic cancer both in vitro and in vivo. Using methyl- 4 -deoxy- 4 -[F- 18]fluoro-D-glucopyranoside (Me- 4 FDG), a PET molecular imaging probe specific for SGLTs, we identify SGLT activity in cancer cell lines, animal tumor xenografts, and human tumors. These results usher in the novel possibility of utilizing SGLT PET imaging molecular imaging probes for diagnosing and characterizing cancerous tumors...|$|R

The procedure described is via a flapless approach, therefore bone quality must be sufficient to avoid perforation of the outer cortex during preparation of the installation site and subsequent engagement of soft <b>tissue.</b> An oral <b>opening</b> of 40 mm in the incisor region is required for ease of instrumentation. The anterior region offers amenable access, however posteriorly, particularly in the mandible, difficulty can be encountered especially when the opposing arch is dentate...|$|R
40|$|Capstone Design and Manufacturing Experience: Fall 2006 A mammogram is {{a common}} and {{effective}} procedure for breast cancer detection. In the event hat abnormal tissue is detected, a wire localization procedure is performed. To accomplish this, the breast must be compressed with a mammogram paddle that has an opening in it and a coordinate system etched on the paddle. However, locating the abnormal <b>tissue</b> with an <b>opening</b> in the paddle is difficult since the original X-ray was done with a solid paddle. An ideal paddle would provide compression to the entire breast and provide access for a wire localization procedure to be conducted anywhere on the compressed surface...|$|R

[...] As the baby moves {{to the opening of}} the vagina it [...] "crowns", meaning {{the top of the head}} can be seen at the vaginal entrance. At one time an [...] "episiotomy", (an {{incision}} in the <b>tissue</b> at the <b>opening</b> of the vagina) was done routinely because it was believed that it prevented excessive tearing and healed more readily than a natural tear. [...] However, more recent research shows that a surgical incision may be more extensive than a natural tear, and is more likely to contribute to later incontinence and pain during sex than a natural tear would have.|$|R
