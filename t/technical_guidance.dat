It {{began after}} Intelligent Systems turned its {{attention}} away from developing hardware for the Famicom towards creating what they called [...] "simulation games". It was directed by Keisuke Terasaki and produced by Gunpei Yokoi. The initial concept was created by Shouzou Kaga, who acted as scenario writer and designer. The graphics and character art was cooperatively handled by Tohru Ohsawa, Naotaka Ohnishi, Satoshi Machida and Toshitaka Muramatsu. The music was composed by Yuka Tsujiyoko, with <b>technical</b> <b>guidance</b> from Hirokazu Tanaka. Tsujiyoko, who would become a recurring composer for the series, became involved as {{she was the only}} composer then employed by Intelligent Systems.

500|$|Many war {{films have}} been {{produced}} {{with the cooperation of}} a nation's military forces. After the Second World War, the United States Navy provided ships and <b>technical</b> <b>guidance</b> for films such as Top Gun. The U.S. Air Force assisted with The Big Lift, Strategic Air Command and A Gathering of Eagles, which were filmed on Air Force bases; Air Force personnel appeared in many roles. Critics point out that the film Pearl Harbors US-biased portrayal of events is a compensation for technical assistance received by the US armed forces; the premiere was actually held on board a U.S. Navy carrier. In another case, the U.S. Navy objected to elements of Crimson Tide, especially mutiny on board an American naval vessel, so the film was produced without their assistance. Film historian Jonathan Rayner observes that such films [...] "have also clearly been intended to serve vital propagandist, recruitment and public relations functions".|$|E
