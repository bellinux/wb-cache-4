5|$|Clarinets {{were soon}} {{accepted}} into orchestras. Later models had a mellower tone than the originals. Mozart (d. 1791) liked {{the sound of}} the clarinet (he considered its tone the closest in quality to the human voice) and wrote numerous pieces for <b>the</b> <b>instrument.,</b> <b>and</b> by the time of Beethoven (c. 1800–1820), the clarinet was a standard fixture in the orchestra.|$|E
5|$|The {{group was}} formed in 1967 by Emerson, Lee Jackson, David O'List and Ian Hague to back soul singer P. P. Arnold. After {{replacing}} Hague with Brian Davison, the group set out on their own, quickly developing a strong live following. The group's sound was centred on Emerson's Hammond organ showmanship and abuse of <b>the</b> <b>instrument,</b> <b>and</b> their radical rearrangements of classical music themes and Bob Dylan songs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1927, Messiaen joined Dupré's organ course. Dupré later wrote that Messiaen, having never seen an organ console, sat quietly for an hour while Dupré {{explained}} and demonstrated <b>the</b> <b>instrument,</b> <b>and</b> then came back a week later to play Johann Sebastian Bach's Fantasia in C minor to an impressive standard. From 1929, Messiaen regularly deputised at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris, for the organist Charles Quef, who was ill at the time. The post became vacant in 1931 when Quef died, and Dupré, Charles Tournemire and Widor among others supported Messiaen's candidacy. His formal application included a letter of recommendation from Widor. The appointment was confirmed in 1931, and he remained the organist at the church for more than sixty years. He also assumed a post at the Schola Cantorum de Paris in the early 1930s. In 1932, he composed the Apparition de l'église éternelle for organ.|$|E

NICMOS contained a heat sink of solid nitrogen to reduce the thermal noise from the instrument, but shortly after it was installed, an unexpected thermal expansion resulted in part of the heat sink coming into contact with an optical baffle. This led to an increased warming rate for <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>and</b> reduced its original expected lifetime of 4.5 years to about 2 years.|$|E
5|$|While at university, Taborn toured and {{recorded}} with jazz saxophonist James Carter. Taborn {{went on to}} play with numerous other musicians in electronic and acoustic settings, while also building {{a reputation as a}} solo pianist. He has a range of styles, and often adapts his playing to the nature of <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>and</b> the sounds that he can make it produce. His improvising, particularly for solo piano, often adopts a modular approach, in which he begins with small units of melody and rhythm and then develops them into larger forms and structures.|$|E
5|$|International {{recognition}} of Rakoto Frah and his performance of traditional sodina music began {{with his first}} overseas voyage to Algeria in 1967. The artist led a troupe of 18Malagasy musicians selected to represent the island's various ethnic groups at the International Festival of Algiers. Among the 80 competitors hailing {{from a variety of}} countries, Rakoto Frah's troupe won the gold medal. This success was followed by performances in Japan, England, the United States, India, Germany, China, Norway, Finland, Australia and France, making him one of the first musicians to perform traditional Malagasy music at music festivals and concerts outside of Madagascar. At these performances, he was often accompanied by supporting musicians under the group name Orchestre Nationale. By exposing international audiences to sodina performances, Rakoto Frah promoted <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>and</b> the traditional musical heritage of Madagascar across the globe. The government of President Tsirananana fell into disfavor and was overturned in 1972, and Rakoto Frah's close association with the unpopular former head of state led the artist to be marginalized {{for the first half of}} the administration of his successor, Didier Ratsiraka (1975–1993).|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} methods of classifying musical instruments. Various methods examine aspects such as the physical properties of the instrument (material, color, shape, etc.), the use for the instrument, {{the means by which}} music is produced with the instrument, the range of <b>the</b> <b>instrument,</b> <b>and</b> the instrument's place in an orchestra or other ensemble. Most methods are specific to a geographic area or cultural group and were developed to serve the unique classification requirements of the group. The problem with these specialized classification schemes is that they tend to break down once they are applied outside of their original area. For example, a system based on instrument use would fail if a culture invented a new use for the same instrument. Scholars recognize Hornbostel-Sachs as the only system that applies to any culture and, more important, provides only possible classification for each instrument. The most common types of instrument classifications are strings, brass, woodwind, and percussion.|$|E

25|$|Internally, {{the cello}} has two {{important}} features: a bass bar, which is {{glued to the}} underside of the top of <b>the</b> <b>instrument,</b> <b>and</b> a round wooden sound post, a solid wooden cylinder which is wedged between the top and bottom plates. The bass bar, found under the bass foot of the bridge, serves to support the cello's top and distribute the vibrations from the strings to the body of the instrument. The sound post, found under the treble side of the bridge, connects the back and front of the cello. Like the bridge, the sound post is not glued, but is kept in place by the tensions of the bridge and strings. Together, the bass bar and sound post transfer the strings' vibrations to the top (front) of <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> (<b>and</b> to a lesser extent the back), acting as a diaphragm to produce the instrument's sound.|$|E

25|$|Intensity is {{measured}} in lux, lumens and foot-candles.

25|$|The accordion's body {{consists}} of two wood boxes joined together by the bellows. These boxes house reed chambers for the right- and left-hand manuals, respectively. Each side has grilles {{in order to facilitate}} the transmission of air in and out of <b>the</b> <b>instrument,</b> <b>and</b> to allow the sound to better project. The grille for the right-hand manual is usually larger and is often shaped for decorative purposes. The right-hand manual is normally used for playing the melody and the left-hand manual for playing the accompaniment, however skilled players can reverse these roles.|$|E
25|$|The bellows is {{the most}} {{recognizable}} part of <b>the</b> <b>instrument,</b> <b>and</b> the primary means of articulation. Similar to a violin's bow, the production of sound in an accordion is {{in direct proportion to}} the motion of the player. The bellows is located between the right- and left-hand manuals, and is made from pleated layers of cloth and cardboard, with added leather and metal. It is used to create pressure and vacuum, driving air across the internal reeds and producing sound by their vibration, applied pressure increasing the volume.|$|E
25|$|Its organists {{have also}} been renowned, {{starting}} with Nicolas Séjan in the 18th century, and continuing with Charles-Marie Widor (organist 1870-1933) and Marcel Dupré (organist 1934-1971), both great organists and composers of organ music. Thus {{for over a century}} (1870–1971), Saint-Sulpice employed only two organists, and much credit is due to these two individuals for preserving <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>and</b> protecting it from the ravages of changes in taste and fashion which resulted in the destruction of many of Cavaillé-Coll's other masterpieces. The current organists are Daniel Roth (since 1985) and Sophie-Véronique Cauchefer-Choplin.|$|E
