The decrease in <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> <b>after</b> application of sewage sludge is in agreement with the results reported by [Speir et al. (2003]) and [Usman et al. (2004]). The decrease in <b>pH</b> <b>after</b> cumulative sludge may probably be attributed to nitrification of N-NH 4 + or release of H+ ions during mineralization from the sludge ([Stamatiadis et al. 1999]; [Antolin et al. 2005]). [Bulluck et al. (2002]) reported a decrease in <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> following the addition of organic amendments, whereas Melero et al.

30|$|As {{shown in}} Additional file 1 : Table S 1, BD and <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> {{increased}} with <b>soil</b> depth while SOC and CEC decreased with soil depth in all land-use types. The significantly higher BD {{found in all}} soil layers in the croplands compared to the forestlands {{can be attributed to}} cultivation activities and less SOC content. Bulk density is directly affected by SOC content and cultivation and increased after the original forests were converted to cultivated land (Lal and Kimble 2001; Murty et al. 2002; Don et al. 2011). More SOC and less soil disturbance in the forestlands likely led to the lower BD at the same depth for these sites compared to the croplands. The lowest pH was found in the surface soil of the tea plantation. The significantly low <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> at each depth in the tea plantation {{may be due to the}} long-term application of a chemical fertilizer since the intensive application of nitrogen fertilizers has been shown to decrease <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> <b>after</b> an undisturbed forest was converted to a tea plantation (Camellia sinensis) (Bahrami et al. 2010).

30|$|The pH and CEC found {{negatively}} correlated across agriculture and grass land. <b>Soil</b> <b>pH</b> for agriculture <b>soils</b> {{was significantly lower}} than for forest soils but the latter was significantly lower than for grassland. Significant increase in <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> <b>after</b> inoculation of different species of earthworms in culture medium corroborates the reports of Basker, Kirkman, and Macgregor (1994). Darwin (1883) and Lee (1985) noticed that the reason behind the change could be the fact that different species of earthworms, including Lumbricus terrestris, secrete calcium carbonate by their calciferous glands. The pH values measured in our study observed to be lower may be because of the fields used with urea ammonium nitrate fertilizer added frequently. At some experimental site in the forest habitat, a higher pH value in fresh earthworm cast compared with adjacent soil was observed. The higher <b>pH</b> of cast <b>soil</b> {{may be due to}} the ammonia secreted in the worm’s gut. In this study, <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> tends to increase in the agricultural lands.

Adapted varieties are usually direct dry seeded and the crop grown under aerobic soil conditions with supplementary irrigation as necessary. Occasionally, yield failures occur which {{may be related to}} soil health problems. In the dry season of 2006 and 2007, we conducted a field experiment in the Philippines, to identify the major causes of such yield failure. Four treatments were implemented: (i) Control of direct dry-seeded rice (improved upland variety Apo), (ii) Biocide application, (iii) transplanting into aerobic soil, and (iv) 1 year fallow. Yield in the Biocide treatment was 2 t ha(- 1) in both years. In all other treatments, yield was 0 - 0. 3 t ha(- 1). Plants grown in the Biocide treatment showed a reduced degree of galling of roots caused by root-knot nematodes (RKN) and better general root health than the Control treatment. Potentially pathogenic fungi were isolated from root samples (Pythium sp [...] Fusarium sp., and a Rhizoctonia-like species).

Expert judgement and preliminary research indicated that soil acidification, due to drainage in the surrounding area, caused the degeneration of the fen meadow. Flooding the meadow with surface water was applied in order to stop acidification. A small irrigated wetland (helophyte filter) was constructed to reduce nutrient availability in the surface water. Sod cutting was applied in a small area as well. The two measures were evaluated through: (1) measurements of hydrological and soil factors, (2) seed bank analysis, (3) recording species composition in permanent plots, (4) assessing the type and extent of nutrient limitation using a full-factorial fertilization experiment, (5) assessing the effect of liming on vegetation biomass, and (6) recording the growth of three introduced fen meadow species in the liming experiment. The research was carried out in a degraded site with intact vegetation, a degraded site where the top soil was removed by sod cutting and a reference site with intact Cirsio-Molinietum vegetation. Groundwater levels in the degraded and the stripped site differed slightly from those of the reference site but they were within the range of Cirsio-Molinietum requirements. Groundwater quality slightly improved in the stripped site. Top-soil removal considerably reduced the macro-nutrient contents and caused a stronger P-deficiency. No increase in <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> was observed immediately after top-soil removal. A small increase in <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> was found <b>after</b> five years in the stripped site, indicating a slight recovery from acidification. Liming after top-soil removal had little effect on the <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> <b>after</b> six months but stimulated the growth of established species such as Agrostis canina. Few viable seeds of characteristic fen meadow species were present in the seed banks of both degraded and well developed fen meadow sites. The species composition after top soil removal reflected the seed bank of the degraded fen meadow and establishment of characteristic fen meadow species was poor, even after five years. The introduced species (Carex hostiana, C. panicea, Cirsium dissectum) survived during the first year in both the degraded and the stripped site. Liming initially stimulated the growth of two species, but in the second year this effect disappeared. After two years, none of the introduced species survived at the stripped site. The restoration measures failed so far, probably because acidification could not be counteracted satisfactorily. Finally, it was concluded that our multidisciplinary approach enables us to draw proper conclusions and that it is suitable for other restoration attempts as well. ...|$|R

The findings indicate that So chemigation can be used to quickly reduce <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> <b>after</b> planting and therefore may be a useful practice to correct high pH problems in established northern {{highbush blueberry}} fields; however, it was less effective and more time consuming than applying prilled So before plantin...|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand leaf Mn {{concentration}} had {{a positive effect on}} plant growth suggesting that changes in <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> bring about by different agro-management practices in these soils could have significant influence on Mn availability and thereby on plant growth. The rubber plant generally grows well in <b>soils</b> with a <b>pH</b> range between 4.0 and 6.5 (Bolton 1964; Krishnakumar and Potty 1992; Priyadarshan 2003). Application of compost and phosphate rock as the basal dressing has increased the <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> from 4.37 to 5.30 and biochar application further increased the <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> upto 6.25 (with 1 % biochar) and 6.58 (with 2 % biochar) immediately after mixing. However, {{by the end of the}} 8 -month experimental period, pH in no LF treatments ranged from 5.57 to 5.69 with no significant effect observed due to biochar application. Dharmakeerthi et al. (2010) observed that increase in <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> due to timber mill waste charcoal remained high by about 1 pH units at the end of the nursery period, but without compost and phosphate rock as a basal application. Several others also have observed an increase in <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> <b>after</b> mixing <b>soils</b> with biochar (Uzoma et al. 2011; Van Zwieten et al. 2010; Chan et al. 2007). When combined with chemical fertilizers, the increase in <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> has been decreased significantly, almost down to the original soil value (Table 4), again with no significant difference due to biochar application. The decrease in pH could probably be due to the release of protons from NH 4 + during nitrification in sulfate of ammonia added treatments, and even due to reduced K and/or Ca concentrations in the soil due to high plant uptake (Wallace 1994). Zhang et al. (2007) observed that decrease in K and Ca in a rubber growing Ferrosol in China has decreased <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> significantly. Increased cation uptake can decrease pH in the rhizosphere soils (Riley and Barber 1971). However this finding is contrary to findings of others (Uzoma et al. 2011; Van Zwieten et al. 2010; Chan et al. 2007) who have observed that the increase in <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> in biochar amended soils remained high till the end of experiment even when fertilizers were applied. The differences could be attributed to the much shorter experimental period of less than 3 months compared to this study, type of fertilizers used or may even be due to the differences in pH buffer capacities. Our findings suggest that application of high alkali rubber wood biochar will not have any lasting effect on <b>pH</b> of this <b>soil</b> when applied together with sulphate of ammonia as the N source. In fact, this is essential given the fact that Mn content in this soil is very low and maintaining an acidic pH is needed to supply Mn requirement of the plant (Kalpage and Silva 1968), if not supplied as a chemical fertilizer.|$|R

40|$|Application {{of compost}} {{as a source}} of {{stabilized}} organic matter is one strategy for increasing the organic carbon content of arable land. To meet environmental standards on nutrient leaching, especially the total P content of the composts limits the application rate. A functional compost with high lignin content and low P concentration would be a valuable tool for maintaining soil fertility. We aimed to determine the effect of feedstock composition on P and lignin content in compost. The research is based on three farm compost experiments with three treatments each, and three compost experiments in nature conservation areas. Besides general characteristics, lignin and ergosterol content and total P and N concentrations were measured in the composts. A 12 -week incubation experiment was set up to measure N mineralization and P release by the composts when applied to the soil. In general, compost characteristics varied due to differences in feedstock and composting process characteristics. The produced farm composts had higher organic matter contents than the other composts; by feedstock selection farm composts with a total P content lower than 3 g P/kg dry matter were produced. The lignin content for the organic part of the compost was relatively constant for different compost types. The incubation experiments indicated that the effect on P availability in soil was strongly related to changes in <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> <b>after</b> compost addition. Our results indicate that total P concentration of the feedstock materials should always be assessed in combination with mass reduction of the feedstock mixture during the composting process...|$|R
30|$|However, {{application}} of biochar could sometimes negatively affect plant growth as observed by Kishimoto and Sugiura (1985) in yields of soybeans and maize with an addition of 5 Mg charcoal ha- 1 and 15 Mg ha- 1, respectively.

Also, urea and AS treated with dicyandiamide (DCD) were compared to the untreated sources. Fertilization rate was 195 kg N ha– 1 yr– 1 split into four applications except SCU which was applied twice. Turfgrass color and clipping production were monitored along with thatch accumulation and <b>soil</b> <b>pH.</b> In a second field experiment, foliar burn potentials of the new N sources were evaluated by comparison to burn potentials from US, UAN, and a liquid 12 - 1. 8 - 3. 3 fertilizer. Turf response to Formolene (solution N source) paralleled that due to US. Turf treated with US received higher color ratings than did that treated with Nitroform or FLUF (suspension N source) during the early growing season but this trend was reversed by late summer. Turf fertilized with FLUF resembled turf fertilized with Nitroform but was inferior to turf fertilized with SCU.

40|$|Lowland heath is {{an internationally}} {{important}} habitat type that has greatly declined in abundance throughout Western Europe. In recent years {{this has led}} to a growing interest in the restoration of heathland on agricultural land. This generally requires the use of chemical <b>treatments</b> to return <b>soil</b> chemical conditions to those appropriate for the support of heathland ecosystems. However, the potential for negative impacts on the environment due to the potential of these treatments to increase the availability of trace metals via raised soil acidity requires investigation. A large-scale field study investigated the effect of two chemical treatments used in heathland restoration, elemental sulphur and ferrous sulphate, on soil acidity and whether it is possible to predict the effect of the treatments on availability of two potentially toxic cations (Al and Cd) in the soil along with their subsequent accumulation in the shoots of the grass Agrostis capillaris. Results showed that both <b>treatments</b> decreased <b>soil</b> <b>pH,</b> but that only elemental sulphur produced a pH similar to heathland soil. The availability of Al, measured by extraction with 1 M ammonium nitrate, could not be predicted by <b>soil</b> <b>pH,</b> depth in the soil and total Al concentration in the soil. By contrast, availability of Cd could be predicted from these three variables.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{nitrogen}} fertilizers and selected pesticides on {{the persistence of}} soil-applied herbicides alachlor, butylate, and atrazine, and the insecticide carbofuran were evaluated in laboratory and field experiments. Nitrogen fertilizer had a greater effect on pesticide persistence in a Sharpsburg silty clay loam (Typic Argiudoll) at pH 5. 8 than at pH 6. 7. Persistence of alachlor and carbofuran increased with ammonium nitrate, ammonium chloride and sodium nitrate concentrations in soil. Urea had less effect on alachlor and butylate persistence than nitrogen salts at pH 6. 7. At pH 5. 8 carbofuran degraded more rapidly in urea amended soil than in untreated soil, while urea increased carbofuran persistence at pH 6. 7. Sodium chloride applied {{at the same rate}} as nitrogen increased pesticide persistence, but the effect was less than that of the nitrogen salts. A strong inverse correlation existed between pesticide persistence and <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> changes due to addition of ammonium nitrate, ammonium chloride and urea. Changes in <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> alone did not account for all observed differences in pesticide degradation. Sodium chloride and sodium nitrate <b>treatments</b> lowered <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> slightly yet differed in effects on pesticide degradation. Atrazine persistence was not affected by nitrogen fertilizers in the Sharpsburg silty clay loam at pH 5. 8 or 6. 8. Butylate persistence was not affected by simultaneous nitrogen application, but persistence increased when nitrogen was applied several days before the herbicide. ^ Carbofuran persistence was increased by the presence of 2, 4 -D in laboratory incubation studies.

40|$|Summary. A {{long-term}} {{experiment in}} north-eastern Victoria has been regularly monitored for wheat yield {{responses to a}} range of lime and fertiliser <b>treatments,</b> and the <b>soil</b> sampled for acidity attributes. Substantial grain yield increases have been consistently obtained over a period of 12 years with a single lime application. Lime applied at 2. 5 t/ha in 1980 was still providing yield increases of 24 % with an acid-tolerant wheat (Matong, 1992 season) and 79 % with an acid-sensitive wheat (Oxley, 1993 season) relative to no lime treatment. The 2 wheat cultivars responded differently to phosphorus fertiliser, with the acid-sensitive wheat less responsive to phosphorus fertiliser in the absence of lime. The use of a regular lime application applied as a fertiliser (125 kg lime/ha) with the wheat seed gave only a small grain yield increase (8 % Matong, 16 % Oxley), despite 1 t/ha of lime applied over the 12 -year period. Liming the soil at a rate of 2. 5 t/ha (1980) initially raised the <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> by about 1. 0 unit and removed most soluble aluminium (0 – 10 cm). However, after 12 years of crop–pasture rotation after the initial 2. 5 t lime/ha <b>treatment</b> the <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> had declined by 0. 7 of a pH unit and exchangeable aluminium was substantially increased, almost to levels prior to the initial application of lime. Given the continued yield responsiveness obtained following the initial application of lime, this practice, rather than regular applications of small amounts of lime, is recommended for wheat production on strongly acidic (pHw < 5. 5) soils in south-eastern Australia.
