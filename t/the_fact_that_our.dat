I took my prompting from them although I am a disciple unworthy of such an undertaking. But in view of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> city of Florence, daughter and offspring of Rome, was mounting and pursuing great purposes, while Rome was in its decline, I thought it proper to trace in this chronicle {{the origins of the}} city of Florence, so far as I have been able to recover them, and to relate the city's further development at greater length, {{and at the same time}} to give a brief account of events throughout the world as long as it please God, in the hope of whose favor I undertook the said enterprise rather than in reliance on my own poor wits. And thus in the year 1300, on my return from Rome, I began to compile this book in the name of God and the blessed John the Baptist and in honor of our city of Florence.|$|E

According to Mercury vice president Marty Maidenberg, an international tour for the album had been planned by October 1996, with concert dates in Japan and the United Kingdom, but it never materialized. In November 1997, Saadiq told the Philadelphia Daily News [...] "there should have been like four singles from that album. You'll have to call Mercury on that. It went Platinum with no promotional tour. We did our job and they made their money." [...] The group disbanded shortly afterwards, and each member went on to pursue an individual music career.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{examples}} from auditory perception research {{will be helpful}} in explaining <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> perceptual faculties naturally enhance and supplement our conscious experience.

When someone is engaged in conversation {{with a group of}} people in a noisy room, but then they suddenly hear something or hear their name from across the room, when they were completely inattentive to the input before, that is the cocktail party phenomenon. This phenomenon also occurs with words associated with danger and sex. Although people may be inattentive to a portion of their environment, when they hear specific [...] "trigger" [...] words, their auditory capacities are redirected to another dimension of perceptual awareness. This shows that we do process information outside of our immediate conscious experience. Similar to visual perception, auditory perception also enhances and supplements our experience by searching out and extracting meaningful information from our environment.|$|E

Hooks is very disturbed by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> culture has lost the true meaning of love, and believes it is because we have no shared definition. For this reason, the first chapter of her book primarily focuses on what she thinks the definition of love is, which she explains includes components such as care, affection, trust, respect, honesty, communication, and commitment. She proposes that if we all came to the agreement that love is a verb rather than a noun, then we would all be happier. Hooks believes love is more of an interactive process. It is not about what we just feel, but more about what we do. She states, [...] "So many people think that it's enough to say what they feel, even if their actions do not correspond to what they are feeling" [...] ("A Chat").
