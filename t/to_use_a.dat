5|$|A {{concurrent}} use registration {{can be very}} detailed in the geographic divisions laid down. It may, for example, allow one party to own the right <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> mark within a fifty-mile radius around a handful of selected cities or counties, while the other party owns {{the right to use}} the same mark everywhere else in the country. It may even divide the rights <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> mark within a particular city by reference to roads or other landmarks in that city.|$|E

The game's story focuses on two different styles of gameplay which the player switches between at various points.|$|E

5|$|A {{central part}} of the show's premise was that the main {{character}} would be handicapped. The initial idea was for House <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> wheelchair, but Fox turned down this interpretation (for which the crew was later grateful). The wheelchair idea turned into a scar on House's face, which later turned into a bad leg necessitating use of a cane. The original script called for House to be 34 years old; however, Shore later explained {{that he did not want}} the character to be that young.|$|E
5|$|A {{separate}} device {{known as}} the combo preamp is necessary to connect a vintage Leslie to another instrument such as a guitar. This combines a separate AC input and line level input onto a single amphenol connector, and provide a footswitch to select between the speeds of the Leslie. Modern products such as the Trek II UC-1A allow any instrument with a phone jack connection <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> variety of Leslie speakers.|$|E
5|$|After Jones makes another {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt to}} open a doorway at a soccer field in Providence, Olivia searches through old case files related to science and unexplained phenomena, and discovers a geographic connection between the soccer field, the city street, and several of their past Fringe cases. Olivia and Walter {{come to the same}} conclusion, that Jones is going <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> site at Reiden Lake to reopen the doorway, the epicenter of these Fringe events. Olivia, Peter, and Walter intercept Jones while he is opening another window and is halfway through it. Peter triggers Walter's device, killing Jones by sealing the doorway.|$|E

5|$|After {{making the}} {{decision}} <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> new character rather than Dizzy, Codemasters allowed Big Red Software free rein to develop the new game, only stipulating {{that it must be}} ready for release within 12weeks. By this point Big Red Software was already familiar with platform adventure games. The game retained the Dizzy graphic adventure title engine. Pete Ranson had previously designed graphics for every Dizzy game bar the first, graphics were shared between Dizzy games and some were also recycled for Seymour Goes to Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, it is {{possible}} <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> lazy deletion strategy in which a key–value pair is removed by replacing the value by a special flag value indicating a deleted key. However, these flag values {{will contribute to the}} load factor of the hash table. With this strategy, it may become necessary to clean the flag values out of the array and rehash all the remaining key–value pairs once too large a fraction of the array becomes occupied by deleted keys.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the conflict, all naval forces in the eastern Mediterranean had switched to the trireme, a warship powered by three banks of oars. The most common naval tactics during the period were ramming (Greek triremes were equipped with a cast-bronze ram at the bows), or boarding by ship-borne marines. More experienced naval powers had by this time also begun <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> manoeuver known as diekplous. It is not clear what this was, but it probably involved sailing into gaps between enemy ships and then ramming them in the side.|$|E

5|$|Bethesda Softworks {{developed}} a spin-off iOS game, Dishonored: Rat Assassin, which it released {{free of charge}} on 30 August 2012. The game requires players <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> knife and crossbow to kill rats while avoiding bombs. Rat Assassin was well received for the variety and quantity of content provided, but received some criticism for dark visuals, that {{made it difficult to}} see the rats. The game drew frequent comparisons to another mobile game, Fruit Ninja.|$|E

5|$|Black Isle's Torn was a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed for Windows by Black Isle Studios, announced on March 22, 2001 and cancelled in July of that year. The game was <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> {{modified version of}} the SPECIAL role-playing system, which had been implemented in the Fallout series. Developed on various editions of the Lithtech engine, Torn possessed features unseen in previous Black Isle Studios games, such as 3D graphics and real-time camera movement.|$|E

5|$|Coarse or {{carpet wool}} sheep are {{those with a}} medium to long length wool of {{characteristic}} coarseness. Breeds traditionally used for carpet wool show great variability, but the chief requirement is a wool that will not break down under heavy use (as would that of the finer breeds). As the demand for carpet-quality wool declines, some breeders {{of this type of}} sheep are attempting <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> few of these traditional breeds for alternative purposes. Others have always been primarily meat-class sheep.|$|E
5|$|Crushing {{can also}} be challenging. In 2013, the Philippines {{resolved}} to crush their five-ton stockpile, {{in part due to}} environmental objections to a large open fire. They first attempted <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> road roller on the tusks and then on smaller, sawn-off pieces. When that did not work, the pieces were repeatedly smashed with a backhoe bucket. What was left was taken to a crematory. When the United States held a similar event a few months later, they opted <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> large rock crusher; a short time later, France employed a pulverizer to turn its illegal ivory into a powder onto which was then poured a composite material to ensure that none of the ivory could be used.|$|E
