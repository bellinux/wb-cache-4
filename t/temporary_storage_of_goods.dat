5000|$|At {{the time}} of its completion, in September 1920, the {{building}} was the largest in the city, as measured by floor space, which was approximately 569,000 ft2 m2 originally. [...] A 229,000 ft2 m2 wing was added to the building's northwest corner in 1935-36, changing what had been an L-shaped building to a roughly U-shaped one. [...] The building has nine floors plus a basement. The 4th through 9th floors were used almost exclusively as warehouse space, while most portions of the 2nd and 3rd floors functioned as office and mail-order workspace. The first floor was used primarily for loading and unloading of freight arriving and leaving by truck or rail and <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> such <b>goods.</b> Three rail spurs served the facility, extending into the ground floor. [...] Among other things, the building is known for its large steel-framed roof sign, the largest sign in Portland, which was constructed in 1925.|$|R
40|$|As widely known, urban port areas {{represent}} considerably complex systems, {{both from}} the environmental and safety viewpoints, especially in case of nearness with installations <b>of</b> <b>temporary</b> <b>storage,</b> or handling <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> (known as "distriparks"). This paper offers a perspective on the different aspects of risk in an urban port area, considering both personnel and process related safety issues. Dealing with the latter aspect, area risk evaluation can be faced by recomposing the risk connected to loading/unloading activities and different transportation modes in the shipping areas, with the contribution due to the stationary industrial equipments/plants. The validity of the framework was tested considering a noticeable Italian case-study, starting from a detailed inventory of the more frequently dangerous goods handled {{in the area and}} the maximum credible amounts stored for a meaningful time (<b>temporary</b> <b>storage)</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The Seals and Identification Laboratory (SILab) is a {{laboratory}} within the Traceability & Vulnerability Assessment Unit, {{part of the}} Institute for the Protectionand Security of the Citizen from the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission. SILab develops technologies and equipment based on ultrasonic control methods and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) techniques, suitable for sealing and/or identification of nuclear or commercial items. This paper presents the work carried out {{in collaboration with the}} European Directorate General TAXUD (Taxation and Customs Union) and the Italian Customs authorities, aiming at proving the potentialities of modern electronic seals for commercial container sealing. Actually, European Customs officers in general and Italian in particular, have problems very similar to nuclear transportation and storage. Some harbours have no more possibility of extension on the sea side and they are building "inland harbours" (hubs) where the dispatching (or <b>temporary</b> <b>storage)</b> <b>of</b> the <b>goods</b> will be done. Each place is {{under the control of the}} Customs authorities, but during the transports between the sea harbour and the inland hub these authorities must also ensure that no goods are diverted. This presentation describes the tests of JRC patented RFID seals carried out in Livorno harbour and Prato hub (Italy). In particular, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) sealing systems have been demonstrated to Customs and Port authorities by simulating different scenarios of seal application, in particular: - Application of RFID seals to a container - The container was not authorized to leave the harbour - The container was authorized to leave the harbour and the seals were correctly setup - Spot check of seals status between Livorno and Prato with portable readers - The container arrives at destination Customs gate with integer seals - The container arrives at destination Customs gate with open seals The results were positive as the JRC demonstrated that the secure transport of containers subjected to Customs obligations is possible with a system that has a very low impact on harbour and hub infrastructures. These obligations are not far from nuclear safeguard ones. With quite few developments, these systems can also be deployed for the purpose of the nuclear safeguards. JRC. E. 8 -Nuclear securit...|$|R

40|$|Hop pellets type 90 are {{the most}} {{frequent}} hop products used in brewing.
