5|$|Ned is a {{genuinely}} well-meaning good-natured person {{and is one}} of the few in Springfield to whom <b>that</b> <b>description</b> applies. Firmly religious, he can be timid and something of a pushover. He is a Republican and a devout Evangelical Christian who strictly follows the Bible literally and is easily shocked when challenged on any point of dogma. This has led to his frequent calls to Reverend Lovejoy, who has become increasingly frustrated with and uninterested in Flanders.|$|E
5|$|The 19th-century {{historian}} Theodor Mommsen compiled {{and described}} in detail the various elements {{that at one time}} or another have been asserted as elements within the ritualistic execution of a parricide during the Roman Era. The following paragraph is based on <b>that</b> <b>description,</b> it is not to be regarded as a static ritual that always was observed, but as a descriptive enumeration of elements gleaned from several sources written over a period of several centuries. Mommsen, for example, notes that the monkey hardly can have been an ancient element in the execution ritual.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of Scleractinia is particularly challenging. Many species were described {{before the advent}} of scuba diving, with little realisation by the authors that coral species could have varying morphologies in different habitats. Collectors were mostly limited to observing corals on reef flats, and were unable to observe the changes in morphology that occurred in more turbid, deeper-water conditions. More than 2,000 nominal species were described in this era, and by the rules of nomenclature, the name given to the first described species has precedence over the rest, even when <b>that</b> <b>description</b> is poor, and the environment and even sometimes the country of the type specimen is unknown.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we wish to}} problematize tourism site/tourist {{interaction}} using ideas drawn from Peircean semiotics {{on the one hand}} and recent thinking on the ties between aesthetics and ideology on other. Linking these ideas leads to the conclusion that for any one tourist site, more information must be provided the more distant the ideology of the tourist is from that of the host country. Thus, one would expect <b>that</b> <b>descriptions</b> of a tourism site directed at the foreign tourist should be longer and provide more background that that provided the domestic tourist who, presumably, is already an interpellated subject of the host society.

25|$|Applying these {{concepts}} {{to a whole}} sequence is basic to higher strategy. If Black starts a sequence that properly ends in an even number of plays, Black retains sente in doing this. If Black starts a sequence that properly ends after an odd number of plays, Black loses sente and takes gote. Accepting gote should only be in return for some profitable exchange. Correct play in the yose (endgame) can consist of playing available sente sequences, and then taking the largest gote sequence on the board, though <b>that</b> <b>description</b> is a simplification. A reverse sente play is a special type of gote play, preventing the opponent from making some sente move. The relative value of reverse sente plays depends on the overall position, but one can count it as twice the value {{of what it would}} be if purely gote.|$|E

25|$|This {{construction}} differs {{slightly from}} the one in (Macdonald, 1979). That construction only uses the surjective morphisms n without mentioning the injective morphisms n: it constructs the homogeneous components of R separately, and equips their direct sum with a ring structure using the n. It is also observed that {{the result can be}} described as an inverse limit in the category of graded rings. <b>That</b> <b>description</b> however somewhat obscures an important property typical for a direct limit of injective morphisms, namely that every individual element (symmetric function) is already faithfully represented in some object used in the limit construction, here a ring RSd. It suffices to take for d the degree of the symmetric function, since the part in degree d of that ring is mapped isomorphically to rings with more indeterminates by n for all n'd. This implies that for studying relations between individual elements, there is no fundamental difference between symmetric polynomials and symmetric functions.|$|E

500|$|Within {{the genus}} Inocybe, I.godeyi has been {{classified}} {{in a number}} of ways. In 1986, mycologist Thom Kuyper placed the species in the supersection Marginatae (subgenus Inocybe), along with species including I.abietis, I.calospora and I.praetervisa. Rolf Singer considers Marginatae a section in subgenus Inocybe, but he placed I.godeyi in the section Geophyllinae (in the subgenus Inocibium) along with species including I.agglutinata and I.pudica. A 2002 phylogenetic study found that Singer's Geophyllinae is probably monophyletic (that is, the taxa all come from a common, recent ancestor) and suggested that I.godeyi forms a clade with species including I.abietis, I.corydalina, I.agglutinata and I.pudica. All species in the clade were [...] "smooth-spored Inocybes with [...] hymenial cystidia", but there were other species that fit <b>that</b> <b>description,</b> such as I.lacera, that were shown not {{to be a part of}} the clade.|$|E

Because of the crowded conditions, [...] "the authorities did {{everything they could to}} keep the prisoners quiet," [...] including lying to them. Captured privateers were sent to England in large numbers [...] "to harass and distress <b>that</b> <b>description</b> of prisoners". All letters sent to and by prisoners were read. Residents of the Melville prison barracks were lice-infested and slept in tier-hung hammocks (first three, and later four tiers), and their activities were more restricted than those of earlier French prisoners.

Rations were considered [...] "robust": prisoners were given [...] each of bread and beef and a gill (0.1421 litres) of peas daily.|$|E
500|$|Peter Carmichael {{refers to}} the {{military}} context for the armies, the [...] "horrendous losses at Chancellorsville and Gettysburg, which effectively destroyed Lee's offensive capacity," [...] implying that these cumulative losses were {{not the result of}} a single battle. Thomas Goss, writing in the U.S. Army's Military Review journal on the definition of [...] "decisive" [...] and the application of <b>that</b> <b>description</b> to Gettysburg, concludes: [...] "For all that was decided and accomplished, the Battle of Gettysburg fails to earn the label 'decisive battle'." [...] The military historian John Keegan agrees. Gettysburg was a landmark battle, the largest of the war and it would not be surpassed. The Union had restored to it the belief in certain victory, and the loss dispirited the Confederacy. If [...] "not exactly a decisive battle", Gettysburg was the end of Confederate use of Northern Virginia as a military buffer zone, the setting for Grant's Overland Campaign.|$|E
500|$|Seychellum alluaudi {{was first}} {{described}} in 1893 by Alphonse Milne-Edwards and Eugène Louis Bouvier, {{as a species}} in the genus Deckenia, D.alluaudi; the specific epithet commemorates Charles A.

Rathbun described [...] "Deckenia cristata" [...] in 1894, in a paper published in the Proceedings of the United States National Museum; her description was based on specimens donated to the United States National Museum by William Louis Abbott, who had travelled to the Seychelles in 1890. At the time, the only other species in the genus was D.imitatrix from the coast of East Africa, and a second species (D.mitis), also from East Africa, was added in 1898. Rathbun synonymised D.cristata and D.alluaudi herself in 1906. The three species of Deckenia at that time {{were considered to be}} sufficiently distinct from other crabs to warrant placement in a separate subfamily (Deckeniinae) or family (Deckeniidae).|$|E
