40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} a bipartite distance-regular graph Γ with diameter D⩾ 4 and valency k⩾ 3. Let X denote the vertex set of Γ and fix x∈X. Let Γ 22 denote the graph with vertex set X˘={y∈X|∂(x,y) = 2 }, and edge set R˘={yz|y,z∈X˘,∂(y,z) = 2 }, where ∂ is the path-length distance function for Γ. The graph Γ 22 has exactly k 2 vertices, where k 2 {{is the second}} valency of Γ. Let η 1,η 2,…,ηk 2 denote the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of Γ 22; we call these the local eigenvalues of Γ. Let A denote the adjacency matrix of Γ. We obtain {{upper and lower bounds}} for the local eigenvalues in terms of the intersection numbers of Γ and the eigenvalues of A. Let T=T(x) denote the subalgebra of MatX(C) generated by A,E 0 *,E 1 *,…,ED*, where for 0 ⩽i⩽D, Ei* represents the projection onto the ith subconstituent of Γ with respect to x. We refer to T as the subconstituent algebra (or Terwilliger algebra) of Γ with respect to x. An irreducible T-module W is said to be thin whenever dimEi*W⩽ 1 for 0 ⩽i⩽D. By the endpoint of W we mean min{i|Ei*W≠ 0 }. We give {{a detailed description of the}} thin irreducible T-modules that have endpoint 2 and dimension D- 3. MacLean [An inequality involving two eigenvalues of a bipartite distance-regular graph, Discrete Math. 225 (2000) 193 – 216] defined what it means for Γ to be taut. We obtain three characterizations of the <b>taut</b> <b>condition,</b> each of which involves the local eigenvalues or the above T-modules...|$|E
