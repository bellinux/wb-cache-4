5|$|All {{vertebrates}} have a blood–brain {{barrier that}} allows metabolism inside <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> operate differently from metabolism {{in other parts}} of the body.

5|$|Buoyancy: The actual mass of {{the human}} brain is about 1400–1500 grams; however, the net weight of the brain {{suspended}} in the CSF is equivalent to a mass of 25-50 grams. The brain therefore exists in neutral buoyancy, which allows <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> maintain its density without being impaired by its own weight, which would cut off blood supply and kill neurons in the lower sections without CSF.|$|E

5|$|In the 21st century, {{these trends}} have continued, and several new {{approaches}} {{have come into}} prominence, including multielectrode recording, which allows the activity of many brain cells to be recorded {{all at the same}} time; genetic engineering, which allows molecular components of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> be altered experimentally; genomics, which allows variations in brain structure to be correlated with variations in DNA properties and neuroimaging.|$|E
5|$|Lack of CSF {{pressure}} and volume can allow <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> sag and descend through the foramen magnum (large opening) of the occipital bone, {{at the base}} of the skull. The lower portion of the brain is believed to stretch or impact one or more cranial nerve complexes, thereby causing a variety of sensory symptoms. Nerves that can be affected and their related symptoms are detailed in the table at right.|$|E
5|$|The skins of {{cephalopods}} {{such as the}} octopus contain complex units, each {{consisting of}} a chromatophore with surrounding muscle and nerve cells. The cephalopod chromatophore has all its pigment grains in a small elastic sac, which can be stretched or allowed to relax {{under the control of}} <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> vary its opacity. By controlling chromatophores of different colours, cephalopods can rapidly change their skin patterns and colours.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> oldest <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> {{have been}} {{discovered}} was in Armenia in the Areni-1 cave complex. <b>The</b> <b>brain,</b> estimated <b>to</b> be over 5,000 years old, {{was found in the}} skull of a 12 to 14-year-old girl. Although <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> were shriveled, they were well preserved due to the climate found inside the cave.|$|R
50|$|Yakovlevian torque is the {{tendency}} of {{the right side of}} <b>the</b> human <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> be warped slightly forward relative to the left and the left side of <b>the</b> human <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> be warped slightly backward relative to the right. This is responsible for certain asymmetries, such as how the lateral sulcus of <b>the</b> human <b>brain</b> is often longer and less curved {{on the left side of}} <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right. It is named for Paul Ivan Yakovlev (1894 - 1983), a Russian-American neuroanatomist from Harvard Medical School.|$|R
5000|$|When {{under stress}} <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> is unable <b>to</b> achieve homeostasis. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> reverts <b>to</b> allostasis, {{which in turn}} alters <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> ability <b>to</b> process pleasure, which is {{experienced}} at the hedonic “set point” (see figures one). [...] Thus, previous pleasures may become no longer pleasurable. This {{is also known as}} anhedonia, or “pleasure deafness.” When stressed, the addict may experience extreme craving—an intense, emotional, obsessive experience.|$|R
5|$|Working {{memory is}} the ability of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> {{maintain}} a temporary representation of information about the task that an animal is currently engaged in. This sort of dynamic memory is thought to be mediated by the formation of cell assemblies—groups of activated neurons that maintain their activity by constantly stimulating one another.|$|E

After a five-hour operation, doctors successfully removed the bullet, which had lodged in her shoulder near her spinal cord. The day following the attack, doctors performed a decompressive craniectomy, in which part of the skull is removed to allow room for <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> swell.|$|E
5|$|Head {{injury is}} present in ancient myths that may date back before {{recorded}} history. Skulls found in battleground graves with holes drilled over fracture lines suggest that trepanation {{may have been used}} to treat TBI in ancient times. Ancient Mesopotamians knew of head injury and some of its effects, including seizures, paralysis, and loss of sight, hearing or speech. The Edwin Smith Papyrus, written around 1650–1550BC, describes various head injuries and symptoms and classifies them based on their presentation and tractability. Ancient Greek physicians including Hippocrates understood <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> be the center of thought, probably due to their experience with head trauma.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fifth}} century BC, Alcmaeon of Croton in Magna Grecia, first {{considered}} <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> be {{the seat of the}} mind. Also in {{the fifth century}} BC in Athens, Hippocrates believed <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> be the seat of intelligence. Aristotle, in his biology initially believed the heart to be the seat of intelligence, and saw the brain as a cooling mechanism for the blood. He reasoned that humans are more rational than the beasts because, among other reasons, they have a larger brain to cool their hot-bloodedness. Aristotle did describe the meninges and distinguished between the cerebrum and cerebellum. Herophilus of Chalcedon in the fourth and third centuries BC distinguished the cerebrum and the cerebellum, and provided the first clear description of the ventricles; and with Erasistratus of Ceos experimented on living brains. Their works are now mostly lost, and we know about their achievements due mostly to secondary sources. Some of their discoveries had to be re-discovered a millennium after their deaths. Anatomist physician Galen in the second century AD, {{during the time of the}} Roman Empire, dissected the brains of sheep, monkeys, dogs, and pigs. He concluded that, as the cerebellum was denser than the brain, it must control the muscles, while as the cerebrum was soft, it must be where the senses were processed. Galen further theorized that the brain functioned by movement of animal spirits through the ventricles.|$|E

5|$|Paul Broca {{associated}} {{regions of}} the brain with specific functions, in particular language in Broca's area, following work on brain-damaged patients. John Hughlings Jackson described {{the function of the}} motor cortex by watching the progression of epileptic seizures through the body. Carl Wernicke described a region associated with language comprehension and production. Korbinian Brodmann divided {{regions of the}} brain based on the appearance of cells. By 1950, Sherrington, Papez, and MacLean had identified many of the brainstem and limbic system functions. The capacity of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> re-organise and change with age, and a recognised critical development period, were attributed to neuroplasticity, pioneered by Margaret Kennard, who experimented on monkeys during the 1930-40s.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, neuroimaging {{studies of}} {{acupuncture}} have explored extensive aspects of <b>brain</b> responses <b>to</b> acupuncture in finding its underlying mechanisms. Most {{of these studies}} have been performed on healthy adults. Only {{a few studies have}} been performed on patients with diseases. <b>Brain</b> responses <b>to</b> acupuncture in patients with the same disease at different pathological stages have not been explored, although it may be more important and helpful in uncovering its underlying mechanisms. In the present study, we used fMRI <b>to</b> compare <b>brain</b> responses <b>to</b> acupuncture in patients with Bell’s palsy at different pathological stages with normal controls and found that <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> response <b>to</b> acupuncture varied at different pathological stages of Bell’s palsy. <b>The</b> <b>brain</b> response <b>to</b> acupuncture decreased in the early stages, increased in the later stages, and nearly returned to normal in the recovered group. All of the changes in <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> response <b>to</b> acupuncture could be explained as resulting from the changes in <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> functional status. Therefore, we proposed that <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> response <b>to</b> acupuncture is dependent on <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> functional status, while further investigation is needed to provide more evidence in support of this proposition...|$|R

5|$|Scientists {{sometimes}} {{refer to}} Parkinson’s disease as a synucleiopathy (due to an abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein protein in <b>the</b> <b>brain)</b> <b>to</b> {{distinguish it from}} other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease where the brain accumulates tau protein. Considerable clinical and pathological overlap exists between tauopathies and synucleinopathies. In contrast to Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease presents most commonly with memory loss, and the cardinal signs of Parkinson's disease (slowness, tremor, stiffness, and postural instability) are not normal features of Alzheimer's.|$|E
5|$|The arms contain tension sensors so the octopus {{knows whether}} its arms are {{stretched}} out, {{but this is}} not sufficient for <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> determine the position of the octopus's body or arms. As a result, the octopus does not possess stereognosis; that is, it does not form a mental image of the overall shape of the object it is handling. It can detect local texture variations, but cannot integrate the information into a larger picture. The neurological autonomy of the arms means the octopus has great difficulty learning about the detailed effects of its motions. It has a poor proprioceptive sense, and it only knows what exact motions were made by observing the arms visually.|$|E
5|$|The direct {{precursor}} of dopamine, L-DOPA, can be synthesized indirectly from the {{essential amino acid}} phenylalanine or directly from the non-essential amino acid tyrosine. These amino acids are found in nearly every protein and so are readily available in food, with tyrosine being the most common. Although dopamine {{is also found in}} many types of food, it is incapable of crossing the blood–brain barrier that surrounds and protects the brain. It must therefore be synthesized inside <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> perform its neuronal activity.|$|E

Meanwhile, Mr. Burns is nearing the completion of his giant robotic laborer, which he hopes will eventually replace weak-bodied human workers. The only remaining step is to implant a human brain into the machine's body. Searching a graveyard the following night, Mr. Burns mistakes Homer, snoring in an open grave, for a newly buried corpse and, despite signs that Homer may still be alive, removes Homer's brain with an ice cream scoop and places it in the robot. However, Robo-Homer is just as lazy and incompetent as he was as a human, using his X-ray vision to locate donuts. Mr. Burns declares the experiment a failure and, after restoring <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> Homer's still-living body, kicks the robot, which topples over and crushes Mr. Burns. Afterward, he tells Smithers to get some surgical tools and ether.|$|E
5|$|Most organisms {{studied to}} date utilize a reward–punishment mechanism: for instance, worms and insects can alter their {{behavior}} to seek food sources or to avoid dangers. In vertebrates, the reward-punishment system is implemented by a {{specific set of}} brain structures, at the heart of which lie the basal ganglia, a set of interconnected areas {{at the base of the}} forebrain. The basal ganglia are the central site at which decisions are made: the basal ganglia exert a sustained inhibitory control over most of the motor systems in the brain; when this inhibition is released, a motor system is permitted to execute the action it is programmed to carry out. Rewards and punishments function by altering the relationship between the inputs that the basal ganglia receive and the decision-signals that are emitted. The reward mechanism is better understood than the punishment mechanism, because its role in drug abuse has caused it to be studied very intensively. Research has shown that the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a central role: addictive drugs such as cocaine, amphetamine, and nicotine either cause dopamine levels to rise or cause the effects of dopamine inside <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> be enhanced.|$|E
5|$|Studies on induced animal {{models of}} human diseases. Here, an animal is treated {{so that it}} {{develops}} pathology and symptoms that resemble a human disease. Examples include restricting blood flow to <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> induce stroke, or giving neurotoxins that cause damage similar to that seen in Parkinson's disease. Such studies {{can be difficult to}} interpret, and it is argued that they are not always comparable to human diseases. For example, although such models are now widely used to study Parkinson's disease, the British anti-vivisection interest group BUAV argues that these models only superficially resemble the disease symptoms, without the same time course or cellular pathology. In contrast, scientists assessing the usefulness of animal models of Parkinson's disease, as well as the medical research charity The Parkinson's Appeal, state that these models were invaluable and that they led to improved surgical treatments such as pallidotomy, new drug treatments such as levodopa, and later deep brain stimulation.|$|E

40|$|Background: Smoking {{cessation}} {{is often}} followed by weight gain. Eating behaviors and weight change {{have been linked}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> response <b>to</b> food, but it is unknown whether smoking influences this response. Objective:We determined the influence of smoking status (smokers compared with nonsmokers) on <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> response <b>to</b> food in re-gions associated with weight changes in nonsmokers. Design: In study 1, we used functional MRI (fMRI) to identify regions of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> associated with weight change in nonsmokers. BMI and <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> response <b>to</b> a milk shake, which is a palatable and energy-dense food, were measured {{in a group of}} 27 nonsmokers (5 men). Sixteen subjects (3 men) returned 1 y later for BMI re-assessment. The change in BMI was regressed against <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> response <b>to</b> isolate regions associated with weight change. In study 2, to determine whether smokers showed altered responses in re-gions associated with weight change, we assessed <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> re-sponse <b>to</b> a milk shake in 11 smokers. <b>The</b> <b>brain</b> response <b>to</b> a milk shake compared with a tasteless control solution was as-sessed in 11 smokers (5 men) in comparison with a group of age-, sex- and body weight–matched nonsmokers selected from the pool of nonsmokers who participated in study 1. Results: The response in the midbrain, hypothalamus, thalamus, and ventral striatum was positively associated with weight change at the 1 -y follow-up in 16 nonsmokers. Compared with nonsmokers, smokers had a greater response to milk shakes in the hypothalamus. Conclusion: Smokers display an altered <b>brain</b> response <b>to</b> food in the hypothalamus, which is an area associated with long-term weight change in nonsmokers.
