50|$|Klannâ€™s {{laboratory}} made additional {{breakthroughs in}} the mid-2000s. It {{has been known}} since the 1960s that new protein synthesis (translation) was necessary {{for the formation of}} long-term memory. However, the mechanisms that regulate this process were not understood until Klann's laboratory published a number of seminal studies describing the <b>translational</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms that are required for proper long-lasting synaptic plasticity and long-term memory. In addition, Klann's laboratory subsequently demonstrated that dysregulated <b>translational</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms are involved in several brain disorders, including fragile X syndromeand autism.|$|E
50|$|In addition, the {{formation}} of long-term memory is believed to lack <b>translational</b> <b>control</b> of localized mRNAs. In mammals, dendrite mRNAs are kept in a repressed state and are activated upon repetitive stimulation. Several regulatory proteins required for <b>translational</b> <b>control</b> in early development {{are thought to be}} needed for memory formation, suggesting similar molecular mechanisms. In an experiment using Drosophila, it has been detected the enzyme responsible for poly(A) elongation in the brain and it has been demonstrated too that its activity is required specifically for long-term memory. These findings provide strong evidence that cytoplasmic polyadenylation is critical for memory formation, and that GLD2 is the responsible enzyme.|$|E
50|$|FMRP {{translation}} repression acts by inhibiting {{the initiation}} of translation. FMRP directly binds CYFIP1, which in turn binds the translation initiation factor eIF4E. The FMRP-CYFIP1 complex prohibits eIF4E-dependent initiation, thereby acting to repress translation. When applied to the observed phenotype in fragile X Syndrome, the excess protein levels and reduction of <b>translational</b> <b>control</b> {{can be explained by}} the loss of translational repression by FMRP in fragile X syndrome. FMRP acts to control translation of a large group of target mRNAs; however the extent of FMRPs <b>translational</b> <b>control</b> is unknown. The protein has been shown to repress the translation of target mRNAs at synapses, including those encoding the cytoskeletal proteins Arc/Arg3.1 and MAP1B, and the CaM kinase II. In addition, FMRP binds PSD-95 and GluR1/2 mRNAs. Importantly, these FMRP-binding mRNAs play significant roles in neuronal plasticity.|$|E

Expression of latency protein LMP 2 A by the human tumor virus Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) activates phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase/Akt located upstream of an essential mediator of growth signals, mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). We show that mTOR is activated by expression of LMP 2 A in carcinoma cells, leading to wortmannin- and rapamycin-sensitive inhibition of the negative regulator {{of translation}}, eukaryotic initiation factor 4 E-binding protein 1, and increased c-Myc protein translation.

Here we describe cloning of the gene encoding Smaug, an RNA-binding protein that interacts with the sequences, SREs, in the nanos mRNA that mediate translational repression. Using an in vitro translation assay, we demonstrate that SRE-dependent repression occurs in extracts from early stage embryos. Immunodepletion of Smaug from the extracts eliminates repression, consistent {{with the notion that}} Smaug is involved. Smaug is a novel gene and the existence of potential mammalian Smaug homologs raises the possibility that Smaug represents a new class of conserved translational repressor...|$|R
40|$|The {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) is a multifunctional organelle {{critical for the}} proper folding and assembly of secreted and transmembrane proteins. Perturbations of ER functions cause ER stress, which activates a coordinated system of transcriptional and <b>translational</b> <b>controls</b> called the unfolded protein response (UPR), to cope with accumulation of misfolded proteins and proteotoxicity. It results in ER homeostasis restoration or in cell death. Senescence is a complex cell phenotype induced by several stresses such as telomere attrition, DNA damage, oxidative stress, and activation of some oncogenes. It is mainly characterized by a cell enlargement, a permanent cell-cycle arrest, {{and the production of}} a secretome enriched in proin-flammatory cytokines and components of the extracellular matrix. Senescent cells accumulate with age in tissues and are suspected {{to play a role in}} age-associated diseases. Since senescence is a stress response, the question arises of whether an ER stress could occur concomitantly with senescence and participate in the onset or maintenance of the senescent features.

Notably, he discovered the mRNA 5' cap-binding protein, eIF4E, the rate-limiting component of the eukaryotic translation apparatus, and also discovered the regulation of eIF4E by the eIF4EBPs. In addition, he has helped to decipher the roles of various other proteins involved in translation including the roles of other subunits of eIF4F (of which eIF4E is a member) including the helicase activity which scans mRNA to find the initiation codon. Sonenberg also discovered the Internal ribosome entry site (IRES) mode of translation, the cap-independent initiation of translation, which is critical for some mRNA involved in stress, cell cycling and apoptosis. His work in basic science has had an impact in the study of cancer, including the realization that eIF4E over expression is prominent in many cancers, and has suggested its utility as a tumor marker. Currently, he has expanded his research into topics such as the roles of translation in neurobiology and synaptic plasticity. Presently, his lab works on <b>translational</b> <b>control</b> in cancer, oncolytic viruses as anti-cancer drugs, microRNA control of translation, and <b>translational</b> <b>control</b> of plasticity, learning and memory.

Later in germination (after 25 min), however, changes {{in the pattern of}} protein synthesis were found. Some of these proteins (a total of 6 polypeptides) correspond possibly to a selective translation of stored messages, whereas the majority of the changed proteins (22 polypeptides) corresponds to newly synthesized mRNA. Thus, multiple levels of protein synthesis regulation seem to occur during zoospore germination, involving both transcriptional and <b>translational</b> <b>controls.</b> We also analyzed the pattern of protein synthesis during germination in a nutrient medium; synthesis of specific polypeptides occurred during late germination.

40|$|Although the {{knowledge}} accumulated on the transcriptional regulations of eukaryotes is significant, {{the knowledge}} on their translational regulations remains limited.

We further experimentally validated the translational activities of 83 TOP candidate genes. Clear translational regulations exerted on the stimulation of 12 -O-tetradecanoyl- 1 -phorbol- 13 -acetate for at least 41 of them was observed, indicating that there should be a few hundreds of human genes which are subjected to regulation at translation levels via TOPs.

40|$|Mutant mice {{produced}} by gene targeting in embryonic stem (ES) cells {{often have a}} complex or embryonic lethal phenotype. In these cases, {{it would be helpful}} to identify tissues and cell types first affected in mutant embryos by following the contribution to chimeras of ES cells homozygous for the mutant allele. Although a number of strategies for following ES cell development in vivo have been reported, each has limitations that preclude its general application. In this paper, we describe ES cell lines that can be tracked to every nucleated cell type in chimeras at all developmental stages. These lines were derived from blastocysts of mice that carry an 11 -Mb beta-globin transgene on chromosome 3. The transgene is readily detected by DNA in situ hybridization, providing an inert, nuclear-localized marker whose presence is not affected by transcriptional or <b>translational</b> <b>controls.</b> The "WW" series of ES lines possess the essential features of previously described ES lines, including giving rise to a preponderance of male chimeras, all of which have to date exhibited germ-line transmission.

40|$|Primary chick myoblast {{cultures}} {{demonstrate the}} ability to take up exogenously supplied polyadenylated RNA and express the encoded information in a specific manner. This expression is shown to exhibit tissue specificity. Analysis of creatine kinase activity monitored at various times of incubation in the presence of either polyadenylated or nonpolyadenylated RNA indicates that only the poly(A) + mRNA is capable of being actively translated. Radioactively labled poly(A) + mRNA is taken up by the cell cultures in a time-dependent manner and subsequently shown to be associated with polysomes. This association with polysomes does not occur in the presence of puromycin and is unaffected by actinomycin D. Thus, nonspecific interaction with polysomes and induction of new RNA synthesis are ruled out and the association of the exogenously supplied poly(A) + mRNA with polysomes is indicative of its translation in the recipient cells. When heterologous mRNA (globin) is supplied to the myoblasts, it is also taken up and properly translated. In addition, exogenously supplied myosin heavy chain mRNA is found associated with polysomes consisting of 4 - 10 ribosomes in myoblast cell cultures while in myotubes it is associated with very large polysomes, thus reflecting the different translational efficiencies that this message exhibits at two very different stages of myogenesis.

50|$|FMRP <b>translational</b> <b>control</b> {{has been}} shown to be {{regulated}} by mGluR signaling. mGluR stimulation may result in the transportation of mRNA complexes to synapses for local protein synthesis. FMRP granules have been shown to localize with MAP1B mRNA and ribosomal RNA in dendrites, suggesting this complex as a whole may need to be transported to dendrites for local protein synthesis. In addition, microtubules were found to be a necessary component for the mGluR-dependent translocation of FMRP into dendrites. FMRP may play an additional role in local protein synthesis by aiding in the association of mRNA cargo and microtubules. Thus, FMRP is able to regulate transport efficacy, as well as repression of translation during transport. Finally, FMRP synthesis, ubiquitination, and proteolysis occur rapidly in response to mGluR signaling, suggesting an extremely dynamic role of the translational regulator.|$|E

Two prominent models of CP function link these controls to late stages of erythroid differentiation: translational silencing of 15 -lipoxygenase (Lox) mRNA and stabilization of -globin mRNA. These two controls are mediated via asso-ciation of CPs with structurally related C-rich 3 -untranslated region elements: the differentiation control elements (DICE) in Lox mRNA and the pyrimidine-rich motifs in -globin mRNA. In the present report a set of mRNA translation and stability assays are used to determine how these two CP-containing complexes, related in structure and position, mediate distinct posttranscriptional controls. While the previously reported translational silencing by the DICE is not evident in our studies, {{we find that the}} two determinants mediate similar levels of mRNA stabilization in erythroid cells. In both cases this stabilization is sensitive to interfer-ence by a nuclear-restricted CP decoy but not by the same decoy restricted to the cytoplasm. These data support a general role for CPs in stabilizing a subset of erythroid mRNAs. The findings also suggest that initial binding of CP to target mRNAs occurs in the nucleus.
