He returned to baseball in 1957 and spent a season with the Birmingham Barons, and partway through the 1958 season, he joined the Panama City Fliers as manager. He was fired a month later, and in protest the Fliers refused to play their next game. Tipton retired afterwards, and a year later was banned for life from the minor leagues after it came to light that he accepted payouts by acting as a liaison for Jesse Levan, who was intentionally fouling off balls in order for gamblers in the stands to <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|Agreeableness is {{negatively}} correlated with income, although agreeable people can be less disruptive in teams {{and are more likely}} to be liked, although not necessarily respected, by their coworkers.

25|$|Upon {{arrival in}} the area with a platoon of soldiers, 2nd Lt. Henry Herrick spots an enemy scout, runs after him, and orders {{reluctant}} soldiers to follow. The North Vietnamese scout lures them into an ambush, resulting in several men being killed, including Lt. Herrick and his subordinates. The surviving platoon members are surrounded with no chance of retreat. Sgt. Savage assumes command, calls in artillery, and uses the cover of night to keep the Vietnamese from overrunning their small defensive position. Meanwhile, with helicopters constantly dropping off units, Lt. Col. Moore manages to secure weak points before the North Vietnamese can <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Vicksburg Campaign was {{bogged down}} in early 1863, {{following}} the repulse of the Union forces under Brigadier General William T. Sherman at Walnut Hills (or Chickasaw Bayou) late the previous year. Major General Ulysses S. Grant wanted to keep his troops busy until he could begin active campaigning later in the spring, so he ordered them to undertake several moves {{that would give the}} appearance of activity but would not bring on a major battle. Grant, writing in his memoirs long after the event, stated {{that he did not have}} great confidence that any of them would prove successful, although he was prepared to <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> if they did.

50|$|Atherton {{also did}} much to {{strengthen}} {{other areas of the}} curriculum, supporting improvement of the liberal arts education around the start of the 20th century.

25|$|The {{education}} reform efforts of women like Davies and the Langham group slowly made inroads. Queen's College (1848) and Bedford College (1849) in London began {{to offer some}} education to women from 1848. By 1862, Davies established a committee to persuade the universities to allow women to sit for the recently established Local Examinations, and achieved partial success in 1865. She published The Higher Education of Women a year later. Davies and Leigh Smith founded the first higher educational institution for women and enrolled five students. The school later became Girton College, Cambridge in 1869, Newnham College, Cambridge in 1871, and Lady Margaret Hall at Oxford in 1879. Bedford began to award degrees the previous year. Despite these measurable advances, few could <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> and life for female students was still difficult.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the failure}} of Johnson's assault, Hood decided to end {{offensive}} actions for the evening and began to plan for a resumed series of attacks in the morning. Schofield ordered his infantry to cross the river, starting at 11 p.m., despite objections from Cox that withdrawal was no longer necessary and that Hood was weakened and should be counter-attacked. Schofield had received orders from Thomas to evacuate earlier that day—before Hood's attack began—and {{he was happy to}} <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> despite the changed circumstances. Although there was a period in which the Union army was vulnerable, outside its works and straddling the river, Hood did not attempt {{to take advantage of it}} during the night. The Union army began entering the breastworks at Nashville at noon on December 1, with Hood's damaged army in pursuit.|$|E
25|$|The first {{shots of}} the battle were fired early {{on the morning of}} October 8. Finding that there were algae-covered pools of water in the {{otherwise}} dry bed of Doctor's Creek, troops from the 10th Indiana advanced to <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> They encountered the forward men of the 7th Arkansas and some shots were exchanged. At 2 a.m., Buell and Gilbert, the III Corps commander, ordered newly promoted Brig. Gen. Phil Sheridan to seize Peters Hill; Sheridan started off with the brigade of Col. Daniel McCook (the younger brother of the I Corps commander). Sheridan seized the hill, driving the Arkansans back to the main line of their brigade, but continued to push across the creek. Liddell's brigade could not check the momentum of Sheridan's thirsty soldiers and Buckner, Lidell's division commander, was ordered by Polk not to reinforce him, but to pull his brigade back. Polk was concerned about starting a general engagement {{to the west of the}} Chaplin River, fearing he was outnumbered. Meanwhile, on the Union side, a nervous Gilbert ordered Sheridan to return to Peters Hill.|$|E

The case of the Marquis de Sade (imprisoned 1777-1790 under a lettre de cachet obtained by his wealthy and influential mother-in-law) is a prominent example.

500|$|William Seward {{was sworn}} in as Governor of New York on January 1, 1839, and inaugurated in front of a crowd of jubilant Whigs. [...] In that era, the annual message by the New York {{governor}} was published and discussed to the extent of that of a president. Seward biographer Walter Stahr wrote that his address [...] "brimmed with his youth, energy, ambition, and optimism". Seward took note of America's great unexploited resources, and stated that immigration should be encouraged in order to <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> He urged that citizenship and religious liberty be granted to those who came to New York's shores. At the time, New York City's public schools were run by Protestants, and used Protestant texts, including the King James Bible. Seward believed the current system was a barrier to literacy for immigrants' children, and proposed legislation to change it. Education, he stated, [...] "banishes the distinctions, old as time, of rich and poor, master and slave. It banishes ignorance and lays axe to the root of crime". Seward's stance was popular among immigrants, but was disliked by nativists; their opposition would eventually help defeat his bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 1860.|$|E
500|$|Castillo Armas's {{government}} {{launched a}} concerted campaign against trade unionists. Some {{of the most}} severe violence was directed at workers on the plantations of the United Fruit Company. The government also attempted to reverse the agrarian reform project initiated by Árbenz, and large areas of land were seized from the agrarian laborers who had received them under Árbenz and given to large landowners. In only a few isolated instances were peasants able to retain their lands. Castillo Armas's reversal of Árbenz's agrarian reforms led the US embassy to comment {{that it was a}} [...] "long step backwards" [...] from the previous policy. Thousands of peasants who attempted to remain on the lands they had received from Árbenz were arrested by the Guatemalan police. Some peasants were arrested under the pretext that they were communists, though very few of them were. Few of these arrested peasants were ever convicted, but landlords used the arrests to evict peasants from their land. The government under Castillo Armas issued two ordinances related to agricultural policy. In theory, these decrees promised to protect the grants of land made by the Árbenz government under Decree900. The decrees also allowed landowners to petition for the return of land seized [...] "illegally". However, the repressive atmosphere at the time in which the decrees were passed meant that very few peasants could <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> In total, of the 529,939 manzanas of land expropriated under Decree900, 368,481 were taken from peasants and returned to landowners. Ultimately, however, Castillo Armas did not go as far towards restoring the power and privileges of his upper-class and business constituency as they would have liked. A [...] "liberation tax" [...] that he imposed was not popular among the wealthy.|$|E
50|$|Finally, in 1838, a {{commutation}} {{bill was}} issued that applied the tithe-tax to landlords instead of peasants. This {{created a new}} system where peasants paid an increase in rent instead of a direct tithe, but it simultaneously enabled peasants to no longer feel that the Anglican Church in Ireland <b>took</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> The Bill did not solve {{all of the problems}} in Ireland, but allowed for some respite in the continuing conflict in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.|$|R

2500|$|Even so, air {{reconnaissance}} {{played a critical}} role in the [...] "war of movement" [...] of [...] 1914, especially in helping the Allies halt the German invasion of France. On 22 August 1914, British Captain L.E.O. Charlton and Lieutenant V.H.N. Wadham reported German General Alexander von Kluck's army was preparing to surround the BEF, contradicting all other intelligence. The British High Command took note of the report and started to withdraw toward Mons, saving the lives of 100,000 soldiers. Later, during the First Battle of the Marne, observation aircraft discovered weak points and exposed flanks in the German lines, allowing the allies to <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1841, {{the newly}} formed Republic of Texas {{recognized}} the difficulties New Mexico was facing and decided to <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> by sending an expedition to invade New Mexico and possibly annex the territory. The invasion failed, and the Texans were captured by Manuel Armijo. This event, {{in addition to the}} numerous Americans already living in New Mexico, led many to believe that New Mexico had weakened and become ready for invasion. [...] The Mexican-American War began in 1846. Stephen W. Kearny led 1,700 American troops into Santa Fe without encountering any resistance. Before the invasion, Martínez had witnessed the animosity towards Native Americans and Mexicans displayed by the Anglos living in New Mexico.

2500|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} obstacle {{to success in}} the 19th century warfare of mass armies was the Confederacy's lack of manpower, and sufficient numbers of disciplined, equipped {{troops in the field}} at the point of contact with the enemy. During the winter of 1862–63, Lee observed that none of his famous victories had resulted in the destruction of the opposing army. He lacked reserve troops to exploit an advantage on the battlefield as Napoleon had done. Lee explained, [...] "More than once have most promising opportunities been lost for want of men to <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> and victory itself had been made to put on the appearance of defeat, because our diminished and exhausted troops have been unable to renew a successful struggle against fresh numbers of the enemy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{campaign}} {{to capture the}} Confederate stronghold at Vicksburg, Mississippi, the last major obstacle to Union control of the Mississippi River, had bogged down {{in the winter of}} 18621863.

Grant wanted to keep his troops busy until he could begin active campaigning later in the spring, so he ordered them to undertake several moves that would give the appearance of activity but would not bring on a major battle. Writing in his memoirs long after the event, he stated {{that he did not have}} great confidence that any of them would prove successful, although he was prepared to <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> if they did. [...] Not only had the operations failed to produce any good results, but the last, the joint ArmyNavy operation known as the Yazoo Pass Expedition, was in danger of being captured or destroyed before it could extricate itself from enemy territory. Grant and Acting Rear Admiral David D. Porter therefore set one more operation in motion. Like the others, it was an effort to get on the enemy flank; it had the additional purpose of relieving some of the pressure on the earlier expedition. To avoid the lethargy in command that had hampered the Yazoo Pass operation, Porter himself went with the gunboats, and the Army was under the personal direction of Major General William T. Sherman.|$|E
