This will be achieved through a discussion and analysis of a quantitative study conducted to assess the attitude of the Ismaili community in Toronto to different aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>policy.</b> Key Marxist concepts as well as Berger and Luckmann's paradigm on social constructionism will be utilised as a framework through which <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> multiculturalism will be conducted...|$|R

However, the Quasi-War was never officially declared and did not involve army action, though it was hard-fought at sea. In the end, President Adams found a diplomatic solution that avoided a war with France. Hamilton's opposition to Adams' re-election helped cause his defeat in the 1800 election. Jefferson and Aaron Burr tied for the presidency in the electoral college in 1801, and Hamilton helped to defeat Burr, whom he found unprincipled, and to elect Jefferson despite philosophical differences.|$|E
