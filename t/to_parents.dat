40|$|The {{study was}} aimed {{to examine whether}} {{attachment}} <b>to</b> <b>parent,</b> empathy, rumination, and forgivingness predict subjective well being of the Javanese adolescents. The study was conducted quantitatively. The respondents were Javanese undergraduate students (N= 65). Data was analyzed with multiple regression statistical analysis. The results showed that 36 % of life satisfaction was explained by attachment <b>to</b> <b>parent,</b> empathy, forgivingness, and rumination (R 2 = 0, 361). Attachment <b>to</b> <b>parent,</b> empathy, forgivingness, and rumination together affected life satisfaction significantly (F = 8, 466; p<O,OOI). Attachment <b>to</b> <b>parent</b> affected life satisfaction significantly (t= 3, 119, p< 0, 01) as well as rumination (t = - 2, 033, p<O, 05). It also found that 25, 7 % of positive affect was explained by attachment <b>to</b> <b>parent,</b> empathy, forgivingness, and rumination (R 2 = 0, 257). Attachment <b>to</b> <b>parent,</b> empathy, forgivingness, and rumination together significantly affected positive affect (F= 5, 181; p<O,OI). Empathy affected positive affect significantly (t = 3, 998, p< 0, 001). Lasty, 31, 8 % of negative affect was ex~lained by attachment <b>to</b> <b>parent,</b> empathy, forgivingness, and rumination (R = 0, 318). Attachment <b>to</b> <b>parent,</b> empathy, forgivingness, and rumination together significantly affected negative affect (F = 5, 181; p<O,O 1). Rumination affected negative affect significantly (t = 2, 03, p< 0, 05) as well as forgivingness (t = - 2, 816, p<O,Ol). Discussion related to Javanese cultural values is presented...|$|R

40|$|Adolescent <b>to</b> <b>parent</b> {{violence}} is virtually absent from policing, youth justice {{and domestic violence}} policy, despite being widely recognized by practitioners in those fields. It is under-researched and rarely appears in criminological discussions of family or youth violence. This article presents the first UK analysis of cases of adolescent <b>to</b> <b>parent</b> violence reported <b>to</b> the police. We analyse victim, offender and incident characteristics from 1892 cases reported to the Metropolitan Police in 2009 – 2010, most of which involved violence against the person or criminal damage in the home. Our findings reveal that adolescent <b>to</b> <b>parent</b> {{violence is}} a gendered phenomenon: 87 per cent of suspects were male and 77 per cent of victims were female. We argue {{that the absence of}} adolescent <b>to</b> <b>parent</b> violence from criminological discourse must be addressed if criminology is to have a thorough understanding of family violence in all its forms...|$|R

This thesis investigated whether parents’ personality traits increase/decrease sensitivity to these cues. Results showed that parents’ {{scores on the}} HEXACO Honesty-Humility scale were negatively related <b>to</b> observed <b>parent</b> affection when judge’s ratings of children’s health were moderate and high, and parents’ scores on the HEXACO Emotionality scale were negatively related <b>to</b> observed <b>parent</b> monitoring when judge’s ratings of children’s happiness were low and high. Further for Emotionality, scores of Emotionality: Attachment were negatively related <b>to</b> <b>parent</b> monitoring and support when ratings of children’s happiness were high, and scores of Emotionality: Worry were positively related <b>to</b> <b>parent</b> support when ratings of children’s health were high.
