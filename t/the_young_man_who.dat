25|$|In an {{interview}} with U.S. President Ronald Reagan, Gresham reported that Reagan, as a fledgling radio announcer, had once used a Colt pistol to save a nurse in Des Moines, Iowa from a mugging on a street. After Gresham's story broke, the nurse came forward and confirmed the story but had no recollection that <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had saved her so many years before {{had turned out to}} have become the popular actor and President of the United States.|$|E
25|$|In {{some parts}} of China, dances are held for {{young men and women}} to find partners. For example, young women are {{encouraged}} to throw their handkerchiefs to the crowd, and <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> catches and returns the handkerchief has a chance at romance. In Daguang, in northeast Guizhou Province, young {{men and women of the}} Dong people would make an appointment at a certain place. The young women would arrive early to overhear remarks made about them by the young men. The young men would praise their lovers in front of their fellows, in which finally the listening women would walk out of the thicket. Pairs of lovers would go off to a quiet place to open their hearts to each other.|$|E
25|$|Shaftesbury's amiability of {{character}} {{seems to have}} been one of his principal characteristics. Like Locke he had a peculiar pleasure in bringing forward young men. Among these may be especially mentioned Michael Ainsworth, a native of Wimborne St Giles, <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> was the recipient of the Letters addressed to a student at the university, and was maintained by Shaftesbury at University College, Oxford. The interest which Shaftesbury took in his studies, and the desire that he should be specially fitted for the profession which he had selected, that of a clergyman of the Church of England, are marked features of the letters. Other protegés were Crell, a young Pole, the two young Furlys and Harry Wilkinson, a boy who was sent into Furly's office at Rotterdam, and to whom several of the letters still extant in the Record Office are addressed.|$|E

25|$|Despite this, Bournonville {{decided to}} compose {{his own version}} of the story about <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> is danced into a spell by a group of elf maidens. In an {{engraving}} from 1856, the painter Edvard Lehmann, who was also a close friend of the Bournonville family, portrayed the spellbound Junker Ove encircled by the hovering, luminous elves. Ove is briefly imprisoned in this state, but fortunately the beautiful Hilda comes to his rescue with water from a healing spring. Even though she has grown up among trolls inside the hill, we know that she is really a changeling, swapped as a baby with the temperamental Birthe, who is the real troll child. The changeling aspect means that the story never becomes as seriously dangerous for Ove as the Sylphide's enchantment is for James in Bournonville's Taglioni-inspired ballet from 1836. But then, again, the Danish Romantics did not cultivate fragmentation {{in the same way as}} the French. The Danes sought for the harmony and the idyll.|$|E
25|$|Bournonville {{must have}} had the folk songs Elveskud (The Elf-shot) and Elvehøj (The Elves' Hill) {{in mind when he}} has Junker Ove linger at the hill after lunch with Miss Birthe, his fiancée, only to dream of another - a {{beautiful}} and gentle Hilda, the counter-image of Birthe. It is always at this point - the moment of doubt before a wedding - that the elves appear. For the young man in the folksong Elveskud, the encounter proves fatal. He refuses to dance with the elf girl and her punishment is so harsh that he dies. He is laid in his grave on his wedding day, followed by his fiancée and his mother. In Elvehøj, which is of a later date than Elveskud, it is God who has human fate in his hands. He lets the cock crow at dawn and <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man,</b> <b>who</b> had slept by the hill, wakes from his spell (which turns out to have been a dream) and he counts himself lucky. The manager of the Royal Theatre, J.L. Heiberg - who Bournonville fell out with on numerous occasions during this period because he thought that Heiberg was trying to drive the ballet off the stage - had experienced great success with his Elvehøj, which in Biedermeier style, lets the elves' dance dissolve into dream and delusion.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} morning hours—between 2:00 am and 3:30 am—on August 28, 1955, Bryant, Milam, and Bryant's wife drove to Mose Wright's house. Milam was armed with a pistol and a flashlight. He asked Wright if he had three boys in the house from Chicago. Till was sharing a bed with another cousin; there were eight people in the small two-bedroom cabin. Milam asked Wright {{to take them to}} [...] "the nigger who did the talking." [...] Till's {{great-aunt}} offered the men money, but Milam refused as he rushed Emmet to put on his clothes. Moses Wright informed the men that Till was from up north and didn't know any better. Milam reportedly then asked, [...] "How old are you preacher?" [...] to which Wright responded [...] "64." [...] Milam threatened that if Wright told anybody he wouldn't live to see 65. The men marched Till out to the truck and asked Carolyn Bryant whether this was <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had accosted her. She said that he was.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{the first}} two lines, the heart wants one thing (emotional love) and the eye wants {{something}} different (physical beauty). The third and fourth lines {{make it clear that}} while the eye is fixated on the physical appearance of the young man, the heart would prefer not to see the person's physical appearance. [...] Instead, it would focus on emotional love. [...] Lines five and six state that <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> is the object of the poem resides inside the speaker's heart, where he is unseen by the [...] "crystal eyes". [...] The seventh and eighth lines state that the eyes disagree with the heart and argue that they are capable of detecting of the beauty of a person.|$|E
2500|$|Delbanco {{argues that}} Melville anticipates Sigmund Freud’s {{assertion}} that the sexual behavior of each human being transgresses [...] "the standard of normality" [...] to some extent. The novel, Delbanco feels, is ambivalent {{in dealing with the}} [...] "rather too loving" [...] supervision of his mother and his [...] "ardent sentiment" [...] for Glen, <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> is his cousin, with whom he explored [...] "the preliminary love-friendship of boys." [...] Yet, continues Delbanco, after an extended discussion, {{it is hard to know}} whether critics who now see Melville as a homosexual are simply making a long overdue acknowledgment or whether gay readers are projecting their own feelings onto Melville – or both. The novel is, after all, subtitled [...] "The Ambiguities." [...] Delbanco concludes that [...] "the quest for a private Melville has usually led to a dead end, and we are not likely to fare better by speculating about his tastes in bed or bunk." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 1949, {{the church}} was damaged in a fire set by an {{arsonist}} described by the Los Angeles Times as a [...] "wild-eyed" [...] and [...] "crazed 25-year-old UCLA art student".

Let her burn. [...] Let her burn." [...] When the pastor and staff tried to extinguish the fire, the arsonist tried to block their passage, struck a staff member in the face, and threw a statue at the fire. [...] The fire caused $5,000 in damages, and the following day, Father Murray said mass in the church and urged forgiveness for <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had set the fire: [...] "Let us pray for the poor boy who didn't know what he was doing.
