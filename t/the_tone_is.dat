5|$|Much of the Leslie's unique tone {{is due to}} {{the fact}} that the system is at least {{partially}} enclosed, whereby linear louvres along the sides and front of the unit can vent the sound from within the box after the sound has bounced around inside, mellowing it. The crossover is deliberately set to 800Hz to give the optimum balance between the horn and the drum, and is considered an integral part of the speaker. <b>The</b> <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> also affected by the wood used. Tone differences, due to cost cutting using particle board for speaker and rotor shelves instead of the previous plywood, are evident in the Leslie's sound. The thinner ply of the top of the cabinet adds a certain resonance as well. Like an acoustic instrument, a Leslie's tone is uniquely defined by its cabinet design and construction, the amplifier, crossover and speakers used, and the motors — not merely by the spinning of rotors.|$|E

50|$|The default mode sends 32 <b>tones</b> within <b>the</b> 1000 Hz audio {{bandwidth}} and <b>the</b> <b>tones</b> <b>are</b> spaced by 1000 Hz/32 = 31.25 Hz. <b>The</b> <b>tones</b> <b>are</b> {{shaped to}} minimize {{the amount of energy}} sent outside the nominal bandwidth.|$|R

25|$|The {{position}} of <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> dependent upon stress: The first stressed syllable {{has a high}} or falling tone, as does the following syllable(s) in grave-accented words.|$|E
25|$|The {{left hand}} alters {{the pitch of}} the strings by {{pressing}} on the string at the desired point. As the instrument has no frets, <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> slightly muddied, but resonant. Techniques include hua yin (slides), rou xian (vibrato), huan ba (changing positions), etc.|$|E
25|$|This tense {{is formed}} with the tense-marker -ná- or -dá- (see above for the {{distinction}} between these). <b>The</b> <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> on the tense-marker itself. In longer verbs in some dialects this tone spreads forward one syllable: ndi-ná-landira / ndi-ná-lándira 'I (have) received'.|$|E

5000|$|The tonal {{system is}} however marginal. Trager {{describes}} <b>the</b> <b>tones</b> as being distinguished by pitch differences. <b>The</b> mid <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> by <b>the</b> most commonly occurring tone; high <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> {{limited to a}} few stems and suffixes; <b>the</b> low <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> relatively common in stem syllables. <b>The</b> high <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> described as [...] "higher and sharper" [...] than <b>the</b> mid <b>tone</b> while <b>the</b> low <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> [...] "distinctly lower and drawling". Many words are distinguished solely by tonal differences as in the following minimal pairs which demonstrate the contrast between <b>the</b> mid <b>tone</b> and <b>the</b> low <b>tone</b> in stressed syllables: ...|$|R

25|$|Unlike many flutes, ocarinas do {{not rely}} on pipe length to produce a {{particular}} tone. Instead <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> dependent on {{the ratio of the}} total surface area of opened holes to the total cubic volume enclosed by the instrument. This means that, unlike a flute or recorder, sound is created by resonance of the entire cavity and the placement of the holes on an ocarina is largely irrelevant – their size is the most important factor. Instruments that have toneholes close to the voicing/embouchure should be avoided, however; as an ocarina is a Helmholtz resonator, this weakens tonal production.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> fatter {{and usually}} {{regarded}} as more mellow and dark than the trumpet or cornet. The {{sound of the}} flugelhorn {{has been described as}} halfway between a trumpet and a French horn, whereas the cornet's sound is halfway between a trumpet and a flugelhorn. The flugelhorn is as agile as the cornet but more difficult to control in the high register (from approximately written G5), where in general it slots or locks onto notes less easily. It is not generally used for aggressive or bright displays as trumpets and cornets often are, but tends more towards a softer and more reflective role.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, the {{advertorial}} emerged. Advertorials {{are most}} commonly {{recognized as an}} opposite-editorial which third parties pay a fee to have included in the paper. Advertorials commonly advertise new products or techniques, such as a new design for golf equipment, {{a new form of}} laser surgery, or weight-loss drugs. <b>The</b> <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> usually closer to that of a press release than of an objective news story. Such articles are often clearly distinguished from editorial content through either the design and layout of the page or with a label declaring the article as an advertisement. However, there has been growing concern over the blurring of the line between editorial and advertorial content.|$|E

500|$|The {{version of}} the song on the album is sparsely {{arranged}} with Dylan accompanying himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica, with William E. Lee playing bass guitar. Author Clinton Heylin states that the song is another of Dylan's [...] "'go out in the real world' songs, like [...] "To Ramona", though less conciliatory – <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> crueler and more demanding." [...] As well as being the final track on Bringing It All Back Home, [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] was also the final song to be recorded for the album.|$|E
500|$|Penelope's story uses {{simple and}} {{deliberately}} naive prose. <b>The</b> <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> described as casual, wandering, and street-wise with Atwood's dry humour and characteristic bittersweet and melancholic feminist voice. The book uses the first-person narrative, though Penelope sometimes addresses the reader {{through the second}} person pronoun. One reviewer noted that Penelope is portrayed as [...] "an intelligent woman who knows better than to exhibit her intelligence". Because she contrasts past events as they occurred from her perspective with the elaborations of Odysseus and with what is recorded in myths today, she {{is described as a}} metafictional narrator.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the comedy}} remains black, the comedic {{style of the}} episode differs {{considerably}} from that of [...] "Sardines", the previous installment of Inside No. 9. [...] "A Quiet Night In" [...] offers a kind of [...] "sadistic slapstick" [...] humour; physical comedy, toilet humour and buffoonery are utilised, with the episode effectively becoming a farce. [...] "A Quiet Night In" [...] builds upon silent comedy tropes and norms, but, for the comedy critic Bruce Dessau, <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> closer to that of Kill List or Sightseers than {{to the work of}} Buster Keaton. The episode features various twists, and these are generally in keeping with Pemberton and Shearsmith's typical approach, though one is reminiscent of the Farrelly brothers.|$|E
500|$|Young actor Vincent Martella, {{previously}} {{known for}} The CW series Everybody Hates Chris, was cast {{for the role}} of Phineas. Martella originally auditioned for the role five months before his initial pickup, but was left without feedback for the time. When Dan Povenmire was given a tape of Martella in Everybody Hates Chris, he called him to do Phineas for the pilot. He designed a different voice than his own which he describes as [...] "wacky [...] crazy." [...] The creators were afraid of him losing it when his voice changed, though he was still able to retain it for the most part even afterward, though <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> now slightly different than the original sound.|$|E
500|$|This song is {{characterized}} by its music produced from synthetic keyboards, and {{has been criticized for}} its lack of innovation, its musical bridge containing vulgar lyrics (with rap) reminiscent of the Madonna's song [...] "American Life", and choirs of children on guitar riffs which are actually the singer's voice remixed. According to journalist Alice Novak, the song begins with [...] "trippy and mysterious" [...] notes played on keyboards, then continues with [...] "fast and nervous" [...] sounds on the drum machine; <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> [...] "rather dark, hypnotic", with an [...] "swaying and repetitive" [...] end which uses [...] "the machinery of the lyrics of some rap groups". Author Erwan Chuberre deemed the lyrics [...] "easy, but deep" [...] and contain an allusion to Farmer's friend Marie Trintignant, who died in 2003.|$|E

500|$|The visual {{style was}} {{described}} by the director as a mix of his own former films which varied from [...] "film-noir in its essence, very dark and very eclectic" [...] to [...] "hand-held", [...] "more visually relaxing". Guy Lodge of Incontention described it as [...] "owing much to film noir in the intricacy of its narrative and the lush, shadow-drenched stylization of its visuals". Wally Hammond, for Time Out London, said its cinematography varies [...] "between atmospheric, noir-esque period evocation and modern widescreen stylings, with excellent use of low-key lighting, silhouettes and location". Mark Jenkins of NPR said it had a [...] "classic look" [...] both in visuals and in storytelling; visually, [...] "with widescreen compositions, overhead shots and dramatic contrasts of light and dark", and in its narrative [...] "ome sequences are quick and messy, but others are grand and theatrical." [...] Joe Morgenstern, critic for The Wall Street Journal, said the [...] "pace is deliberate, [...] <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> pensive, albeit punctuated by occasional violence." ...|$|E
500|$|Horrible Histories was immediately, {{and almost}} universally, greeted with {{critical}} enthusiasm. On its debut, Alice-Azania Jarvis of The Independent described {{the show as}} [...] "fun, filthy and genuinely engaging, in a peer-to-peer way." [...] Harry Venning in The Stage approved the [...] "seriously funny, beautifully performed and endlessly inventive sketches" [...] along with [...] "plenty of crowd-pleasing fart and poo gags." [...] By the second series, the show's cross-generational appeal was beginning to attract significant attention from adult media. Naomi West of The Daily Telegraph characterised the first series as [...] "boundary-pushing", suggesting that [...] "the bold decision to approach the series {{in the same way}} as an adult show has been the key to its success... delivers more laughs than most post-watershed comedies." [...] James Delingpole in The Spectator likewise recommended the show to viewers of all ages, saying that [...] "Even though there are vast quantities of entirely gratuitous fart, bottom and wee wee jokes, the cumulative effect—bizarrely—is one of dumbing up rather than down." [...] Discussing the first two series in The Guardian, television writer Jesse Armstrong said that [...] "Hit shows are very difficult to achieve. You need to have everything just right—that's what's so terrifying. But Horrible Histories has a great cast and brilliant writers. They're also blessed with great source material. <b>The</b> <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> perfect and it is done in a non-patronising, engaging way".|$|E
