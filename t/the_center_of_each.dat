5|$|Steel {{base metal}} is iron, which {{is able to}} take on two {{crystalline}} forms (allotropic forms), body centered cubic (BCC) and face centered cubic (FCC), depending on its temperature. It is the interaction of those allotropes with the alloying elements, primarily carbon, that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties. In the body-centred cubic arrangement, there is an iron atom in the centre of each cube, and in the face-centred cubic, there is one at <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> of the six faces of the cube.|$|E

The lower surface is light, white to grey, blotched irregularly with gray spots. The barndoor skate is unique from {{other species of}} skate in its having a straight line that begins at the snout and ends at the anterior margin of the outer corner of the disk, but stopping short of the disk.|$|E
5|$|A {{percentage}} {{of each group}} working in less contaminated areas was badged. Eventually, 18,875 film-badge dosimeters were issued to about 15% of the total work force. On {{the basis of this}} sampling, a theoretical total exposure was calculated for each person who did not have a personal badge. As expected, exposures for target ship crewmen who reboarded their ships after Baker were higher than those for support ship crews. The hulls of support ships that entered the lagoon after Baker became so radioactive that sleeping quarters were moved toward <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> ship. Of the total mass of radioactive particles scattered by each explosion, 85% was unfissioned plutonium which produces alpha radiation not detected by film badges or Geiger counters. There was no method of detecting plutonium in a timely fashion, and participants were not monitored for ingestion of it.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} duality applies {{as well to}} {{infinite}} graphs embedded in the plane {{as it does to}} finite graphs. However, care is needed to avoid topological complications such as points of the plane that are neither part of an open region disjoint from the graph nor part of an edge or vertex of the graph. When all faces are bounded regions surrounded by a cycle of the graph, an infinite planar graph embedding can also be viewed as a tessellation of the plane, a covering of the plane by closed disks (the tiles of the tessellation) whose interiors (the faces of the embedding) are disjoint open disks. Planar duality gives rise to the notion of a dual tessellation, a tessellation formed by placing a vertex at <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> tile and connecting the centers of adjacent tiles.|$|E
5|$|Topologically, the Pythagorean tiling has {{the same}} {{structure}} as the truncated square tiling by squares and regular octagons. The smaller squares in the Pythagorean tiling are adjacent to four larger tiles, as are the squares in the truncated square tiling, while the larger squares in the Pythagorean tiling are adjacent to eight neighbors that alternate between large and small, just as the octagons in the truncated square tiling. However, the two tilings have different sets of symmetries, because the truncated square tiling is symmetric under mirror reflections whereas the Pythagorean tiling isn't. Mathematically, this {{can be explained by}} saying that the truncated square tiling has dihedral symmetry around <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> tile, while the Pythagorean tiling has a smaller cyclic set of symmetries around the corresponding points, giving it p4 symmetry. It is a chiral pattern, meaning {{that it is impossible to}} superpose it on top of its mirror image using only translations and rotations.|$|E
5|$|Built {{during the}} 13th and 14th centuries, the Palazzo Senatorio ("Senatorial Palace") stands atop the Tabularium, {{which had once}} housed the {{archives}} of ancient Rome. Peperino blocks from the Tabularium were re-used in {{the left side of}} the palace and a corner of the bell tower. It now houses the Roman city hall. Its double ramp of stairs was designed by Michelangelo. This double stairway to the palazzo replaced the old flight of steps and two-storied loggia, which had stood on the right side of the palace. The staircase cannot be seen solely in terms of the building to which it belongs but must be set in the context of the piazza as a whole. The steps, beginning at <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> wing, move gently upward until they reach the inner corner, level off and recede to the main surface of the façade. They then continue an unbroken stateliness toward each other, converging on the central doorway of the second story. This interruption of the diagonal line and the brief inward change of direction both absorbs the central axis and links the two sides. The fountain in front of the staircase features the river gods of the Tiber and the Nile as well as Dea Roma (Minerva). The upper part of the facade was designed by Michelangelo with colossal corinthian pilasters harmonizing with the two other buildings. Its bell-tower was designed by Martino Longhi the Elder and built between 1578 and 1582. Its current facade was built by Giacomo della Porta and Girolamo Rainaldi.|$|E

25|$|A vertex-first {{cross-section}} uses some hyperplane {{orthogonal to}} a line joining opposite vertices {{of one of the}} 24-cells. For instance, one could take any of the coordinate hyperplanes in the coordinate system given above (i.e. the planes determined by x'i = 0). The cross-section of {3,4,3,3} by one of these hyperplanes gives a rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb. Each of the rhombic dodecahedra corresponds to a maximal cross-section of one of the 24-cells intersecting the hyperplane (<b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> such (4-dimensional) 24-cell lies in the hyperplane). Accordingly, the rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb is the Voronoi tessellation of the D3 root lattice (a face-centered cubic lattice). Shifting this hyperplane halfway to one of the vertices (e.g. x'i = ½) gives rise to a regular cubic honeycomb. In this case <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> 24-cell lies off the hyperplane. Shifting again, so the hyperplane intersects the vertex, gives another rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb but with new 24-cells (the former ones having shrunk to points). In general, for any integer n, the cross-section through x'i = n is a rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb, and the cross-section through x'i = n + ½ is a cubic honeycomb. As the hyperplane moves through 4-space, the cross-section morphs between the two periodically.|$|E

25|$|Active {{systems are}} {{designed}} for three-dimensional noise cancellation.
