5|$|Themistocles now {{developed}} a second strategy. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) {{would require the}} army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. This could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites, despite the overwhelming numbers of Persians; furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium. However, after the Tempe debacle, it was uncertain whether the Spartans {{would be willing to}} march out from the Peloponnesus again. To persuade the Spartans to defend Attica, Themistocles had <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> the Athenians were willing to do everything necessary for the success of the alliance. In short, the entire Athenian fleet must be dispatched to Artemisium.|$|E

25|$|In his speech, Pericles {{states that}} he had been emphasising the greatness of Athens in order to convey that the {{citizens}} of Athens must continue to support the war, <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> what they were fighting for was of the utmost importance. To help make his point he stated that the soldiers who he was speaking of gave their lives to a cause to protect the city of Athens, its citizens, and its freedom. He praised Athens for its attributes that stood out amongst their neighbours such as its democracy when he elaborates that trust is justly placed on the citizens rather than relying only on the system and the policy of the city. Where citizens boast a freedom that differs from their enemies’ the Lacedaemonians. He regards the soldiers who gave their lives as truly worth of merit. That if anyone should ask, they should look at their final moments when they gave their lives to their country and that should leave no doubt {{in the mind of the}} doubtful. He explained that fighting for one’s country was a great honour, and that it was like wearing a cloak that concealed any negative implications because his imperfections would be outweighed by his merits as a citizen. He praises the soldiers for not faltering in their execution during the war. That the soldiers put aside their desires and wishes for the greater cause. Because as they are described by Pericles, Athenian citizens were distinct from the citizens of other nations – they were open minded, tolerant, and ready to understand and follow orders. Where their system of democracy allowed them to have a voice amongst those who made important decisions that would affect them. Therefore, he proceeds to point out that the greatest honour and act of valour in Athens is to live and die for freedom of the state Pericles believed was different and more special than any other neighbouring city.|$|E

ESPN {{assessed}} {{him as a}} [...] "do-it-all prospect" [...] and projected him as a wide receiver because of his size and speed. Smith was recruited by Maryland, Penn State, and Virginia Tech. He was shown interest by Virginia, but did not receive a scholarship offer. The Virginia staff, which questioned whether he had recovered his speed after a basketball injury during his junior year, asked Smith to run a 4.5-second 40-yard dash at a Nike combine at Clemson University, which he did. The Virginia staff then asked him to repeat the feat at the University of Virginia campus, but Maryland offered a scholarship, which Smith accepted. He later said, [...] "I kind of hold a grudge against U.Va. a little bit. I'm not afraid to say it.

In late July, when Datebook republished the interviews, editor Art Unger put Lennon's quote [...] "I don't know which will go first—rock 'n' roll or Christianity!" [...] on the cover. Also on the cover was a quote from Paul McCartney regarding America: [...] "It's a lousy country where anyone black is a dirty nigger!" [...] In Birmingham, Alabama, WAQY DJ Tommy Charles heard about Lennon's remarks from his coworker Doug Layton, and was immediately incensed, saying, [...] "That does it for me.

Charles later stated, [...] "We just felt it was so absurd and sacrilegious that something ought to be done <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> they can't get away with this sort of thing". Al Benn, who was the bureau manager for United Press International News, heard the WAQY show and immediately filed a news report in New York City, culminating in a major news story in The New York Times on 5 August. Over twenty other stations followed WAQY's lead with similar announcements. Some stations in the Deep South went further, organising demonstrations with bonfires, drawing hordes of teenagers to publicly burn their Beatles records and other memorabilia.|$|E

He wished that the appointments to the posts of officers in the new force should be made by the rajah, who should lend an ear to the advice of his usual councillors; but that, once appointed, they should be under his absolute command and control, and that he should have power to dismiss those who proved themselves indolent and incapable, to promote active and energetic men, wholly regardless of influence or position.|$|R
