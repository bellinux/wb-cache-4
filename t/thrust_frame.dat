40|$|The {{stated goal}} of the conference was {{to build on the}} great success of {{applicable}} harmonic analysis in the last decade by bringing together first-rate senior experts along with promising young researchers in the theory and application of wavelet analysis, non-linear approximation, computational fluid dynamics and other applications with an emphasis on a combination of theoretical development with practical applications. The mix of topics worked out marvelously. Although talks were originally grouped into sessions according to topic, the resolution of various scheduling conflicts mixed up these groupings quite thoroughly. However, since all talks were plenary and wellattended, the mixing did not prevent anyone from hearing any talk. It also made the workshop quite lively at times, with the participants sometimes gaining unexpected inspiration from superficially unconnected but in fact surprisingly relevant adjacent talks. 1 Wavelet Frames Frames were introduced by R. J. Duffin and A. C. Schaeffer in 1952, in the context of non-harmonic Fourier series. But it was the context of multiresolution analysis and the wavelet expansion in applied harmonic analysis that has <b>thrust</b> <b>frames</b> and other means of generating redundant systems into the forefront. Frames are a system of functions that mimic many of the properties of orthogonal system...|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine thrust}} acts along the engine centreline. The {{aircraft}} [...] "holds" [...] the engine {{on the outer}} casing of the engine at {{some distance from the}} engine centreline (at the engine mounts). This arrangement causes the engine casing to bend (known as backbone bending) and the round rotor casings to distort (ovalization). Distortion of the engine structure has to be controlled with suitable mount locations to maintain acceptable rotor and seal clearances and prevent rubbing. A well-publicized example of excessive structural deformation occurred with the original Pratt & Whitney JT9D engine installation in the Boeing 747 aircraft. The engine mounting arrangement had to be revised with the addition of an extra <b>thrust</b> <b>frame</b> to reduce the casing deflections to an acceptable amount.|$|E

The four outboard engines and the third-stage engine burned longer to compensate, and the vehicle achieved {{very close to the}} planned circular 100 nmi km parking orbit, followed by a normal translunar injection about two hours later.

50|$|From {{momentum}} considerations, propulsion requires {{material to}} be pushed backwards to push the vehicle forwards. In general, energy efficiency is highest when the air or exhaust gas used to propel the vehicle end up travelling as slow as possible for the required <b>thrust,</b> in the <b>frame</b> of reference of the Earth.|$|R

40|$|In {{the frame}} of a project funded by ESA, a {{consortium}} led by Avio in cooperation with Snecma, Cira, and DLR is performing the preliminary design of a High-Thrust in-Space Liquid Propulsion Stage for {{two different types of}} manned missions beyond Earth orbit. For these missions, one or two 100 ton stages are to be used to propel a manned vehicle. Three different propellant combinations; LOx/LH 2, LOx/CH 4 and MON- 3 /MMH are being compared. The preliminary design of the storable variant (MON- 3 /MMH) has been performed by DLR. The Aestus II engine with a large nozzle expansion ratio has been chosen as baseline. A first iteration has demonstrated, that it indeed provides the best performance for the storable propellant combination, when considering all engines available today or which may be available in a short- to medium term. The RD- 861 K engine has been proposed as alternative to reduce the development duration of the high-thrust stage. Structure analyses and optimisations have converged towards a common bulkhead architecture with a Whipple shield, similar to the one used on the ATV, to protect the main propellant tanks against perforations caused by meteoroids and space debris. The propulsion system has been built around six Aestus II engines equipped with TVC and placed on a circular engine <b>thrust</b> <b>frame.</b> The RCS, the thermal system, and the power system have also been included in the preliminary design, and they have been sized for the most demanding mission. The performance of the high-thrust stage, resulting from the preliminary design, has been assessed for both missions taken into consideration...|$|E
60|$|Suddenly Tua, in her sleep, heard a voice, and, awaking with a start, {{saw a man}} {{who stood}} near by, leaning on a thornwood staff and contemplating them. He was a very strange man, {{apparently}} of great age, for his long white hair fell down upon his shoulders, and his white beard reached to his middle. Once {{he must have been}} very tall, but now he was bent with age, and the bones of his gaunt <b>frame</b> <b>thrust</b> out his ragged garments. His dark eyes also were horny, indeed it seemed as though he could scarcely see with them, for he leaned forward to peer at their faces where they lay. His face was scored by a thousand wrinkles, and almost black with exposure to the sun and wind, but yet of a marvellous tenderness and beauty. Indeed, except that it was far more ancient, and the features were on a larger and a grander scale, it reminded Tua of the face of Pharaoh after he was dead.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reason for}} the {{appearance}} of a gravitational offset is Einstein's equivalence principle, which states that the effects of gravity on an object are indistinguishable from acceleration. When held fixed in a gravitational field by, for example, applying a ground reaction force or an equivalent upward <b>thrust,</b> the reference <b>frame</b> for an accelerometer (its own casing) accelerates upwards with respect to a free-falling reference frame. The effects of this acceleration are indistinguishable from any other acceleration experienced by the instrument, so that an accelerometer cannot detect the difference between sitting in a rocket on the launch pad, and being in the same rocket in deep space while it uses its engines to accelerate at 1 g. For similar reasons, an accelerometer will read zero during any type of free fall. This includes use in a coasting spaceship in deep space far from any mass, a spaceship orbiting the Earth, an airplane in a parabolic [...] "zero-g" [...] arc, or any free-fall in vacuum. Another example is free-fall at a sufficiently high altitude that atmospheric effects can be neglected.|$|R
40|$|Transversity Distribution, which {{describes}} the quark transverse polarization inside a transversely polarized nucleon, {{is the last}} leading-twist missing piece of the QCD description of the partonic structure of the nucleon. Transversity can be extracted from Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS) data, where, due to its chiralodd nature, it couples to a new, unknown fragmentation function, called Collins function. Independent information on the Collins function can be obtained in e+e- -> qq annihilation processes, where q = u, d, s. In the cross section formula, the Collins effect introduces a term {{that depends on the}} polarization of the quark q (antiquark q), which produces an asymmetry in the azimuthal distribution of the fragmenting products. For unpolarized beams we do not know the spin of the quarks arising from the e+e- annihilation process, and hence we cannot measure the spin effects due to the Collins function analyzing the hadron distributions generated in only one jet, which come from the fragmentation of a single quark. The Collins spin effect can instead be studied in inclusive production of two hadrons detected in opposite jets, produced by the fragmentation of a correlated qq pair: e+e- -> qq -> h 1 h 2 X. This correlation results in an observable azimuthal asymmetry distribution of the two hadrons. In this thesis, we present the measurement of the Collins asymmetries in the pions system (h 1; h 2 = π), using a sample of about 468 fb^(- 1) of data collected at a center of mass energy of 10. 54 and 10. 58 GeV, with the BABAR detector at the e+e- collider PEPII at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory of Stanford. The Collins asymmetries are calculated in two different <b>frames</b> called <b>thrust</b> reference <b>frame</b> (RF 12), and second hadron momentum frame (RF 0), and the final results are shown {{as a function of the}} fractional energy and, for the first time in e+e- annihilation, as a function of the transverse momenta of the two pions. These results can be used in combination with Belle, HERMES, and COMPASS data in order to improve the extraction of the Transversity function, and Collins fragmentation function...|$|R
