Whereas the original has got a three-dimensional quality to it, it's got a spontaneity to it, it's got an excitement to it, and a way of involving the viewer that this one lacks." [...] Gibbons has parodied Lichtenstein's derivation of the Novick work.|$|E
500|$|Shadows Fall {{released}} their sixth album, Retribution, on September 15, 2009, {{through the}} band's own label, Everblack Industries, {{which was created}} in conjunction with Warner Music Group's ILG, Ferret Music and ChannelZERO Entertainment. It is being released in the UK via Spinefarm Records. The album was produced by Chris [...] "Zeuss" [...] Harris. Drummer Jason Bittner recently stated about the band's new material, [...] "The songs {{are a little more}} on the darker, angry side... lots of heaviness, lots of crazy guitar, and LOTS of room for me to have some fun. There {{is no doubt in my}} mind that this will be the best performance of my career, so far, and I owe <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> guys for bringing me incredible riffs to write killer drum parts to." [...] As of the fall of 2009 the band was appearing on the 'Shock & Raw' tour of North America with 2Cents, Otep & Five Finger Death Punch. After a South American tour, Shadows Fall will be playing on the Jägermeister Stage in the 2010 Rockstar Mayhem Festival in July and August 2010. The band is also scheduled to support Lamb of God on their Australian tour in December 2009 Shadows Fall is pleased to announce their first and only New York City performance this year, taking place at Santos Party House on December 18, 2010 with direct support from Thy Will Be Done.|$|E
500|$|Usher had {{initially}} planned {{to release the}} album entitled All About U, as his third studio album on October 31, 2000. The album was to follow his successful My Way (1997) which to date, has sold over seven million copies. On March 13, 2000, multiple tracks from the album had leaked on to online music store Napster several months prior to its release, including [...] "T.T.P.", [...] "U R the One" [...] and [...] "Pop Ya Collar". Following the event, the album's release was delayed twice, on December 5, 2000 to July 17, 2001. During the taping of MTV Icon Janet Jackson special, Usher explained that {{he returned to the}} studios to record new songs, stating [...] "I didn't want that to be the way my record was remembered or the way I would present <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> fans [...] It turned out a lot better" [...] while adding that tracks that were available for download on the site {{were not going to be}} included on the new album. With new tracks produced, Usher's publicist announced a new name for the album, under the title 8701, who claims that it is [...] "practically a new album". The origin of its new name was initially unknown, with speculation that it subsides with its US release of August 7, 2001 (8/7/01), though Usher's publicist claimed that this was purely coincidental, and was not the reasoning for the title. Usher hinted that it was derived after something significant to him, and he would disclose it in the upcoming months. Eventually, his spokesperson revealed that the '87' segment of the title refers to the year 1987, when Usher sang in public for the first time at his church in Atlanta, with the '01' referring to the year 2001.|$|E

2500|$|Psychoanalysts {{today do}} not regard {{cross-dressing}} by {{itself as a}} psychological problem, unless it interferes with a person's life.

Gilles Fluet, a Musi-Café patron who was leaving the site just before the derailment, said the wheels were smoking lots of white smoke. The runaway train passed [...] behind him moving at highway speed. Travelling with no signals, the train jumped the track, sending a river of burning oil into the lake. [...] "It was moving at a hellish speed ... no lights, no signals, nothing at all. There was no warning. It was a black blob {{that came out of}} nowhere.

2500|$|For {{these reasons}} {{there was a}} {{reluctance}} to use the title. Although Walpole is now called the [...] "first" [...] Prime Minister, the title was not commonly used during his tenure. Walpole himself denied it. In 1741, during the attack that led to Walpole's downfall, Samuel Sandys declared that [...] "According to our Constitution we can have no sole and prime minister." [...] In his defence, Walpole said [...] "I unequivocally deny that I am sole or Prime Minister and <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> influence and direction all the affairs of government must be attributed." [...] George Grenville, Prime Minister in the 1760s, said it was [...] "an odious title" [...] and never used it. Lord North, the reluctant head of the King's Government during the American War of Independence, [...] "would never suffer himself to be called Prime Minister, {{because it was an}} office unknown to the Constitution." ...|$|E

2500|$|Charles {{made his}} debut for Wales {{in a game}} against Northern Ireland at Windsor Park on 20 April 1955; the Welsh won 3–2 thanks to a John Charles hat-trick. His second cap came against Austria on 23 November, in a game latter dubbed the 'Battle of Wrexham'. He was stretchered off with fifteen minutes to go after an Austrian boot went through the back of his leg; this was notable as the only time John ever lost his temper, as he reacted to the {{challenge}} by lifting the Austrian off the ground and screaming [...] "If you ever do <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> brother again I'll bloody kill you!" [...] Charles was then selected for the 1957 British Home Championship squad, and helped his country to record a 2–2 draw with Scotland at Ninian Park. He also battled against injury to play in the 3–1 defeat to England at Wembley Stadium, before the tournament ended with a goalless draw in Ireland.|$|E
2500|$|At the conclusion, Poirot {{is forced}} to admit that Blunt does indeed stand in public life [...] "for all the things <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> mind are important.

I am concerned with the lives of private individuals who have the right not to have their lives taken from them." [...] Stating {{that he does not}} feel that Blunt's claims to be needed in the world justifies the deaths that resulted from his plan, he turns Blunt over to the police. Later, he speaks with Howard Raikes and Jane Olivera, telling them that they now have the [...] "new heaven and the new earth" [...] that they desire, asking them only to [...] "let there be freedom and let there be pity". In the last chapter, Barnes tells Poirot that he took a strong interest in the case as his (Barnes's) own undercover sobriquet was Albert Chapman, but he had never been married.|$|E
