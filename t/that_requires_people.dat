It is impractical to transport large amounts of currency {{around the world and}} physically exchange domestic currency for the currency that a customer/supplier demands. Instead, money is taken out of an account at a local bank (which is in local currency) and an equivalent amount of money is put in the customer's or supplier's account at their local bank (in a foreign currency). The money from the buyer's account goes to an internal account of your bank. The money to the customer or supplier comes from an account the buyer's local bank holds with a bank in the supplier's country—the buyer's bank's correspondent account, at their correspondent bank.|$|E

40|$|In recalling {{a set of}} {{previously}} experienced events, people exhibit striking effects of recency, contiguity and similarity: recent items tend to be recalled best and first, and items that were studied in neighboring positions or {{that are similar to}} one another in some other way, tend to evoke one another during recall. Effects of recency and contiguity have most often been investigated in tasks <b>that</b> <b>require</b> <b>people</b> to recall random word lists. Similarity effects have been most often studied in tasks <b>that</b> <b>require</b> <b>people</b> to recall categorized word lists. Here we examine recency and contiguity effects in lists composed of items drawn from three distinct taxonomic categories and where items from a given category are temporally separated from one another by items from other categories, all of which are tested for recall. We find evidence for both long-term recency and long-range contiguity, bolstering support for temporally sensitive models of memory, and highlighting the importance of understanding the interaction between temporal and semantic information during memory search...|$|R

50|$|Depending on the state, {{they will}} apply the {{insanity}} law {{by means of}} burden of proof. The burden of proof is either on the prosecutor, in which the prosecutor must prove that the defendant is not insane, or on the defense. If {{the burden of the}} proof is on the defense side they must prove the defendant is insane. After the application of the insanity defense began states also acquired a law in Jones v. United States <b>that</b> <b>requires</b> <b>people</b> released due to insanity to be held in a mental hospital for a similar time they would be in prison. The courts also require that the subject in question is able to withstand a trial, if not they must be hospitalized until they are able to go to trial. Another way a case regarding mental illness is handled is the verdict being “guilty but mentally ill”, in these scenarios the person is given a sentence but is offered psychiatric treatment while incarcerated or is taken to a mental hospital, once they are believed to be capable enough they are taken to a prison to serve the remainder of their sentence.|$|E

In the current series of studies, we examined how concurrent verbal pro-tocols affected performance on two tasks that required users to frequently switch between cognitive strate-gies. Data revealed that CVP slowed down participants in comparison with participants who completed tasks in silence. The number of strategy changes that were required to complete a task did not affect this performance decrement. We conclude by discussing the limitations of the experiments reported here, and with practical advice for usability experts who use CVP in their own work...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Ground level ozone {{remains a}} serious problem in the United States. Because ozone non-attainment is a summer problem, episodic rather than {{continuous}} controls of ozone precursors are possible. We evaluate the costs and effectiveness of an episodic scheme <b>that</b> <b>requires</b> <b>people</b> to buy permits in order to drive on high ozone days. We estimate the demand function for permits based on a survey of 1, 300 households in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. Assuming that all vehicle owners comply with the scheme, the permit program would reduce VOCs by 50 tons and NOx by 42 tons per Code Red day at a permit price of $ 75. Allowing for non-compliance by 15 % of respondents reduces {{the effectiveness of the}} scheme to 39 tons of VOCs and 33 tons of NOx per day. The cost per ozone season of achieving these reductions is approximately $ 9 million (2008 USD). This compares favorably with permanent methods of reducing VOCs that cost $ 645 per ton per year...|$|E

40|$|The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was {{designed}} to increase health insurance coverage in the United States. Its most controversial feature is the requirement that US residents purchase health insurance. Opponents of the mandate argue <b>that</b> <b>requiring</b> <b>people</b> {{to contribute to the}} collective good is inconsistent with respect for individual liberty. Rather than appeal to the collective good, this Viewpoint argues for a duty to buy health insurance based on the moral duty individuals have to reduce certain burdens they pose on others.

40|$|American law {{presumes that}} all persons are born either female or male, and rests a {{surprising}} number of legal entitlements on this presumption. Persons’ legal rights to express their identity at work, to use public accommodations, and to retain legal parenthood status with respect to their children may all depend on whether they are female or male. Yet we, as individuals, generally have no choice regarding whether we are legally designated female or male, just as people had no choice as to whether they were designated “colored” or “white” under past racial discrimination schemes. The American legal system plays {{a significant role in the}} construction, maintenance, and coercive enforcement of the binary gender system <b>that</b> <b>requires</b> <b>people</b> to conform their identities in distorting ways to be included politically. By sustaining the gender system, legal institutions unnecessarily undermine human well-being, and unjustly and disrespectfully constrain individual liberty. The United States and state governments should re-examine laws that use sex or gender as a category by adapting the Law Commission of Canada’s methodology in Beyond Conjugality. In this fashion, American law can begin to move gradually away from the creation, maintenance, and enforcement of the gender system...|$|E

40|$|Designing usable smart {{products}} is a multidisciplinary effort <b>that</b> <b>requires</b> <b>people</b> with very diverse knowledge to collaborate. Collaboration is challenging because knowledge from various design stakeholders with different needs and constraints {{has to be}} integrated in a design. Design mock-ups are used by designers to facilitate the collaboration. Design mock-ups help integrate different perspectives because they evoke {{different things to different}} stakeholders and help them negotiate the limits within which they can agree on a design. Literature suggests the analytical boundary object concept as a theory to explain how mock-ups support the integration of knowledge in design collaboration. I review the literature on the boundary object concept and iterate it with the data collected from a one year ethnographic study of a multidisciplinary product development project to design a smart usable device. I discuss that the boundary object concept fails to conceptualize how mock-ups support negotiation and suggest the concept of dynamic boundary objects as a more appropriate concept for the role of mockups in design collaboration. Design mock-ups iteratively support the boundary negotiation activities of self-explanation, inclusion, compilation and structuring.
