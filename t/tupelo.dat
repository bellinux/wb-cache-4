5|$|A.M. is {{the debut}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band Wilco, released on March 28, 1995, by Sire Records and Reprise Records. The album was released only {{months after the}} breakup of Uncle <b>Tupelo,</b> an alternative country band that was the predecessor of Wilco. Prior to its release, there was debate about whether the album {{would be better than}} the debut album of Son Volt, the new band of former Uncle <b>Tupelo</b> lead singer Jay Farrar.|$|E
5|$|Before {{releasing}} {{their first}} album with Sire, Uncle <b>Tupelo</b> needed a drummer. Farrar and Tweedy interviewed twenty-four candidates and were both impressed with Ken Coomer and Bill Belzer. Belzer was chosen and Uncle <b>Tupelo</b> embarked on the European {{segment of the}} promotional tour for March 16–20, 1992 as the opening act for Sugar. Belzer was dismissed from the band after six months, and Coomer was hired as his permanent replacement. Coomer {{was not the only}} new member added after the tour—Uncle <b>Tupelo</b> sought to expand beyond a trio for the Anodyne recording sessions. They recruited multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston and bassist John Stirratt—Stirratt's presence enabled Tweedy to become a full-time guitarist on the songs that he wrote.|$|E
5|$|No Depression is {{the first}} studio album by {{alternative}} country band Uncle <b>Tupelo,</b> released in June 1990. After its formation in the late 1980s, Uncle <b>Tupelo</b> recorded the Not Forever, Just for Now demo tape, which received a positive review by the College Media Journal in 1989. The review led to the band's signing with what would become Rockville Records later that year. The album was recorded with producers Sean Slade and Paul Q. Kolderie at Fort Apache Studios, on a budget of US$3,500.|$|E

5|$|Uncle <b>Tupelo</b> was an {{alternative}} country music group from Belleville, Illinois, active between 1987 and 1994. Jay Farrar, Jeff Tweedy, and Mike Heidorn formed the band after {{the lead singer}} of their previous band, The Primitives, left to attend college. The trio recorded three albums for Rockville Records, before signing with Sire Records and expanding to a five-piece. Shortly {{after the release of}} the band's major label debut album Anodyne, Farrar announced his decision to leave the band due to a soured relationship with his co-songwriter Tweedy. Uncle <b>Tupelo</b> split on May 1, 1994, after completing a farewell tour. Following the breakup, Farrar formed Son Volt with Heidorn, while the remaining members continued as Wilco.|$|E
5|$|While Wilco was {{recording}} tracks, Jay Farrar {{formed a}} band of his own, Son Volt. Son Volt signed to Warner Bros. Records and began recording their first album (also produced by Paulson), Trace, in November 1994. The fact that both Wilco and Son Volt began working on album almost immediately after the Uncle <b>Tupelo</b> breakup caused debate among critics, fans, and Warner Brothers about {{which would be the}} better band. Joe McEwen, who originally signed Uncle <b>Tupelo</b> to a Warner subsidiary, felt that Wilco was taking a step backwards from the material on Anodyne. McEwen urged Richard Dodd, who had recently mixed Tom Petty's Wildflowers, to remix the album. Dodd emphasized Tweedy's vocals to increase the chances of success on radio.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the time}} of the {{recording}} of March 16–20, 1992, Mike Heidorn had secured a steady job at a Belleville newspaper company and was dating a woman who had two children from a previous marriage. Uncle <b>Tupelo</b> had planned a tour of Europe, but Heidorn wanted to stay in Belleville with his girlfriend, whom he married in August 1992.|$|E
5|$|Following Uncle Tupelo's final tour, Tweedy {{encouraged}} his bandmates to {{join him}} in a new group, while Farrar searched for members for a band of his own. Tweedy was able to retain the rest of the Uncle <b>Tupelo</b> lineup, and created Wilco. Wilco began rehearsing {{a few days after the}} final Uncle <b>Tupelo</b> concert, and by August 1994 they were in the recording studio for their first album, A.M.. Farrar asked Jim Boquist to join his new band, Son Volt; Boquist was a multi-instrumentalist who had performed with Joe Henry as the opening act on Uncle Tupelo's last tour. Boquist also recruited his brother Dave, and Farrar convinced Mike Heidorn to leave Belleville to join the group. Farrar's new four-piece began recording their debut album Trace in November 1994.|$|E
5|$|Presley {{was born}} on January 8, 1935 in <b>Tupelo,</b> Mississippi, to Gladys Love (née Smith; 1912–1958) and Vernon Elvis Presley (1916–1979), in the two-room shotgun house built by Vernon's father in {{preparation}} for the child's birth. Jesse Garon Presley, his identical twin brother, was delivered stillborn 35 minutes before his own birth. Jesse was buried in an unmarked grave at Priceville Cemetery in <b>Tupelo.</b> After Presley became famous, he asked people on several occasions to try and find the whereabouts of Jesse. The efforts were to no avail, because no papers marked the spot. Presley became close to both parents and formed an especially close bond with his mother. The family attended an Assembly of God church, where he found his initial musical inspiration. Although he was in conflict with the Pentecostal church in his later years, he never officially left it. Rev. Rex Humbard officiated at Presley's funeral, because Presley had been an admirer of Humbard's ministry.|$|E
5000|$|Still Feel Gone {{has been}} {{generally}} well received by critics. Pitchfork called the album [...] "so much stronger" [...] than Uncle <b>Tupelo's</b> debut No Depression.|$|R
50|$|The {{alternative}} {{country group}} Uncle <b>Tupelo's</b> 1992 album March 16-20, 1992 includes three covers of songs from High Atmosphere. Jeff Tweedy is the vocalist {{on all of}} these cover versions.|$|R
5000|$|Carvel Lee Ausborn (September 24, 1923 - December 1973), {{better known}} by his stage name, Mississippi Slim, was a hillbilly singer {{who had a}} radio show on <b>Tupelo's</b> WELO during the later 1940s.|$|R
5|$|Uncle <b>Tupelo</b> also {{recorded}} a one-hour radio special that {{was released by}} Legacy Records in 2003. Legacy only distributed the CD, entitled The Long Cut: A One Hour Radio Special, to non-commercial radio stations {{as a way to}} promote the re-issues of the band's studio albums. The special is hosted by Lauren Frey and features interviews by Farrar, Tweedy, and Heidorn.|$|E
5|$|Uncle Tupelo's final album, Anodyne, {{featured}} a new lineup for the band—a five-piece outfit with drummer Ken Coomer, bassist John Stirratt, and multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston. Tensions mounted between singers Jay Farrar and Jeff Tweedy, and Uncle <b>Tupelo</b> played its last concert on May 1, 1994, at Mississippi Nights in St. Louis, Missouri.|$|E
5|$|With {{the release}} of their 1990 debut LP, No Depression, the Belleville, IL, trio Uncle <b>Tupelo</b> {{launched}} more than simply their own career—by fusing the simplicity and honesty of country music with the bracing fury of punk, they kick-started a revolution which reverberated throughout the American underground.|$|E
500|$|The band's {{first three}} albums {{influenced}} contemporary roots rock {{artists such as}} Richmond Fontaine and Whiskeytown. Uncle <b>Tupelo's</b> usage of distorted guitars to play a style of music that was known for its earnestness became a lasting trend in 1990s modern rock. Jason Ankeny wrote in Allmusic that: ...|$|R
5000|$|Davidia involucrata, the dove-tree, {{handkerchief}} tree, pocket handkerchief tree, or ghost tree, is {{a medium-sized}} deciduous {{tree in the}} family Nyssaceae.

It is native to South Central and Southwest China from Hubei to southern Gansu, south to Guizhou, Sichuan and Yunnan, but is widely cultivated elsewhere.|$|R
5000|$|On July 4, 1979, {{it changed}} its call letters to WTVA {{in honor of}} <b>Tupelo's</b> {{recognition}} as the first Tennessee Valley Authority city in the Southeast. The WTWV call sign was later used on WFRQ, a radio station in Mashpee, Massachusetts on Cape Cod. The WTWV call sign is now in use by a Memphis-based TV station. Neither the Massachusetts nor the Memphis station {{are related to the}} current WTVA.|$|R
5|$|Although Uncle <b>Tupelo</b> {{broke up}} before it {{achieved}} commercial success, {{the band is}} renowned for {{its impact on the}} alternative country music scene. The group's first album, No Depression, became a byword for the genre and was widely influential. Uncle Tupelo's sound was unlike popular country music of the time, drawing inspiration from styles as diverse as the hardcore punk of The Minutemen and the country instrumentation and harmony of the Carter Family and Hank Williams. Farrar and Tweedy's lyrics frequently referred to Middle America and the working class of Belleville.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Joe McEwen of Sire Records {{began to}} pursue the band. McEwen, who brought notable acts such as Dinosaur Jr and Shawn Colvin to Sire, had been {{interested}} in them since hearing the Not Forever, Just for Now demo tape. At the urging of Gary Louris, McEwen offered Uncle <b>Tupelo</b> a contract. Band manager Tony Margherita invoked the $50,000 escape clause he had put in their Rockville contract, freeing the band to sign a seven-year deal with Sire. The deal required two albums, and specified a budget of $150,000 for their first.|$|E
5|$|In Terms of fatalities, the New Richmond Tornado {{presently}} {{ranks as}} the ninth deadliest tornado in United States history. At {{the time of its}} occurrence, it ranked as the third deadliest tornado in American history, outflanked only by the 1840 Great Natchez Tornado and the 1896 St. Louis-East St. Louis tornado. Since 1899, the record has only been surpassed six times, those being the Amite-Purvis Tornado in 1908, the Tri-State Tornado in 1925, the <b>Tupelo</b> and Gainesville tornadoes in 1936, the 1947 Woodward Tornado and most recently the 2011 Joplin Tornado.|$|E
50|$|Anthocyanins {{are present}} in about 10% of tree species in {{temperate}} regions, although in certain areas — most famously New England — up to 70% of tree species may produce the pigment. In autumn forests, they appear vivid in the maples, oaks, sourwood, sweetgums, dogwoods, <b>tupelos,</b> cherry trees and persimmons. These same pigments often combine with the carotenoids' colors to create the deeper orange, fiery reds, and bronzes typical of many hardwood species.|$|R
5000|$|The {{compilation}} contains mostly original {{songs from}} Uncle <b>Tupelo's</b> four studio albums. [...] "Outdone" [...] is a demo {{version of the}} song released on No Depression. [...] "I Wanna Be Your Dog" [...] was previously unreleased. [...] "Looking For a Way Out" [...] is an acoustic version of the track released on Still Feel Gone. [...] "Effigy", a Creedence Clearwater Revival cover, was originally released on the 1993 compilation album No Alternative.|$|R
5000|$|Founded in 1947, the <b>Tupelos</b> are {{the oldest}} a cappella group at Wellesley College. The group has {{arranged}} numerous pieces with a repertoire that includes pop, jazz, throwbacks, and traditional Wellesley songs. For over 65 years, {{they have been}} performing for audiences {{up and down the}} East Coast, hosting guest groups, and competing at the collegiate level. They are known for their iconic [...] "Sunday Candy" [...] mashup performance and have been featured on Acaville Radio.|$|R
5|$|In between tours, Farrar, Tweedy and Heidorn {{formed a}} country cover band named Coffee Creek, along with Brian Henneman (later {{a member of}} The Bottle Rockets). Henneman {{impressed}} Uncle <b>Tupelo,</b> and {{he was invited to}} be a guitar technician and occasional multi-instrumentalist for the band. While Farrar and Heidorn would avoid drinking too much after shows, Tweedy would continue drinking throughout the night. Although Tweedy stopped after he began dating Sue Miller in 1991, a significant communication gap had already been opened between Tweedy and Farrar.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{the country}} music charts were {{dominated}} by pop singers with only tangential influences from country music, a trend that has continued since. The 1980s saw a revival of honky-tonk-style country {{with the rise of}} people like Dwight Yoakam and the new traditionalists Emmylou Harris and Ricky Skaggs, as well as the development of alternative country performers like Uncle <b>Tupelo.</b> Later alternative country performers, like Whiskeytown's Ryan Adams and Wilco, found some mainstream success.|$|E
5|$|It's {{strange to}} hear Uncle <b>Tupelo</b> {{mentioned}} {{because what we}} were doing was in such a long line of musical history. People are wrong in starting with us and saying we started anything because we were just picking up the ball, starting with Woody Guthrie and on to the early '60s and the Flying Burrito Brothers that we were influenced by. We didn't start a genre. We contributed to a long line of fairly good music. That's the way we looked at it at the time—doing what was right for the song.|$|E
5000|$|The Hound Dogs name is an {{homage to}} <b>Tupelo's</b> best-known native, the [...] "King of Rock 'n Roll" [...] Elvis Presley, in {{particular}} his cover version of [...] "Hound Dog", which became that song's best-known version and one of Presley's best-known recordings in general. (They are the second football team to use the name in homage to Presley; the first, the Memphis Hound Dogs, was a proposed NFL expansion team that was not accepted to the league upon its expansion in 1995.) ...|$|R
500|$|Anodyne was Uncle <b>Tupelo's</b> only {{recording}} {{to appear}} on the American Billboard Heatseekers chart. Despite the lack of a single to promote the album, sales eventually surpassed 150,000 copies. A promotional tour for the album began later that year, including a sold-out show at Tramps in New York City. Most shows on the tour sold over one thousand tickets. The success of the tour encouraged the label; according to Sire executive Bill Bentley, [...] "people here {{thought we were going to}} have platinum records from Uncle Tupelo." ...|$|R
50|$|Subsequently, Ray {{moved to}} Chicago and began collaborations {{with many of}} that city’s leading musical lights, {{including}} Uncle <b>Tupelo’s</b> Jeff Tweedy and Jay Farrar, Jon Langford of the Mekons, the performance artist Brigid Murphy, and Poi Dog Pondering’s Frank Orrall. In 1991 he started the Chicago underground jug band Devil in a Woodpile with Rick Sherry, and in 1993 co-founded the Bottle Rockets with Brian Henneman. Ray was also {{a founding member of}} the Langford-helmed combos the Waco Brothers and the Pine Valley Cosmonauts.|$|R
