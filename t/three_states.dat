40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} <b>three</b> <b>state</b> perfect {{phylogeny}} problem {{and establish a}} generalization of the four gamete condition (also called the Splits Equivalence Theorem) for sequences over <b>three</b> <b>state</b> characters. Our main result is that a set of input sequences over <b>three</b> <b>state</b> characters allows a perfect phylogeny {{if and only if}} every subset of three characters allows a perfect phylogeny. In establishing these results, we prove fundamental structural features of the perfect phylogeny problem on <b>three</b> <b>state</b> characters and completely characterize the minimal obstruction sets that must occur in <b>three</b> <b>state</b> input sequences that do not have a perfect phylogeny. We further give a proof for a stated lower bound involved in the conjectured generalization of our main result to any number of states. Until this work, the notion of a conflict, or incompatibility, graph has been defined for two state characters only. Our generalization of the four gamete condition allows us to generalize the notion of incompatibility to <b>three</b> <b>state</b> characters. The resulting incompatibility structure is a hypergraph, which can be used to solve algorithmic and theoretical problems for <b>three</b> <b>state</b> characters. 1...|$|R

5|$|In the end, {{there were}} 56 tornadoes {{confirmed}} during the outbreak, including three EF3 tornadoes reported across <b>three</b> <b>states,</b> {{as well as}} three EF4 tornadoes; two in Alabama and one in Kansas, the first such tornadoes since {{the introduction of the}} Enhanced Fujita Scale. Total damages were estimated at over $580million from tornadoes alone, making it the fourth-costliest tornado outbreak in US history (the figure not including damage from other thunderstorm impacts including hail and straight-line winds). Insured losses in the state of Georgia topped $210million, making this outbreak the costliest in that state's history. Enterprise, Alabama, which was hit the hardest, sustained damages in excess of $307million.|$|E

The latter's anti-UAR government had also been overthrown by pro-UAR officers in 1963.

5|$|Tarla Makaeff, {{who paid}} nearly $60,000 to Trump University in 2008, brought {{a class action}} lawsuit against Trump University on April 30, 2010, in U.S. District Court for Southern California. The suit, Makaeff v. Trump University, LLC, sought refunds for Makaeff and other former clients of Trump University, as well as punitive damages for breach of contract, fraud, negligent {{misrepresentation}} and bad faith. It did not originally name Donald Trump as a defendant, but did so in a later amended complaint. In February 2014, U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel denied recognition to the nationwide class the plaintiffs had requested and recognized the suit as class-action {{on the part of}} Trump University clients in <b>three</b> <b>states</b> – California, Florida, and New York – based on specific alleged violations of the consumer protection laws of those states. He also narrowed the case to five of the plaintiffs' original fourteen charges.|$|E

The 1st Brigade was headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma and had elements of the 377th and 379th in regiments in its battalions. The 2nd Brigade was headquartered in Lawton, Oklahoma with elements of the 378th and 379th Regiments. The 3rd Brigade was headquartered in Stillwater, Oklahoma, a move made in September 1975, and consisted of only 291st Regiment elements. The 4th Brigade was headquartered in Bossier City, Louisiana, a suburb of Shreveport, and includes the 95th Regiment and one element of the 379th. The Committee Group was headquartered in Little Rock, Arkansas with no Regimental elements. The 95th Support Battalion was headquartered in Midwest City, Oklahoma with the Division Headquarters, Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 95th Division Leadership Academy, and the 95th Division Maneuver Training Command.

5|$|The highway was {{originally}} commissioned on November 11, 1926, {{with the rest}} of the original U.S. Highway System. At the time, it ran between Forest Lake, Minnesota, and Pembine, Wisconsin, with a planned continuation to Powers, Michigan. Several changes have been made to the routing of the highway since then. The western end was extended south to Minneapolis before it was truncated back to Forest Lake. Other changes on the east end have moved that terminus from the originally planned end location at Powers to the current location in Norway. Internal Wisconsin and Michigan DOT map files at various times have shown plans to reroute the highway to connect to the original 1926 terminus. US8's course through the <b>three</b> <b>states</b> has also been shifted to follow different alignments over the years.|$|E
5|$|The ideal he {{expressed}} in a work of the period, Equilibru între antithesi ("A Balance between Antitheses") was moderate progressivism, with the preservation of social peace. In Tudor Vianu's view, partly based on earlier assessments by other critics, Equilibru, with its stress on making political needs coincide with social ones through the means of counterweights, evidenced strong influences from Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's thought, as well as vaguer ones from that of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Nonetheless, his system parted with Hegelianism in that, instead of seeking {{a balance between the}} Geist and existence, it considered the <b>three</b> <b>states</b> of human progress (Thesis, antithesis, synthesis) the reflection of a mystical number favored throughout history.|$|E
