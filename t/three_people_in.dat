5|$|August 28, 1971– Tropical Storm Doria {{moves through}} the entire state, causing torrential {{rainfall}} amounting {{to a maximum of}} 8.09inches (20.55cm) in Trenton. The storm kills <b>three</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|In Haiti, the {{southern}} {{periphery of the}} hurricane killed <b>three</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Port au Prince. Later, Donna brushed the north coast of Cuba with strong winds and heavy rainfall, causing damage along much of the coast. In Gibara, the storm wrecked 80houses.|$|E
5|$|Departing Bermuda, Gonzalo {{accelerated}} {{toward the}} waters of the North Atlantic, passing close to southeastern Newfoundland before becoming extratropical on October 19. Gusty winds and bands of heavy rain in the southeastern Avalon Peninsula engendered minor flooding and power outages. A large storm system involving the remnants of Gonzalo battered the British Isles and central Europe on October 21, killing <b>three</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the United Kingdom and severely hindering transportation. The system later played a role in triggering torrential rains over the Balkans, which resulted in severe flooding in Greece and Bulgaria.|$|E

5|$|In the Atlantic, Irene {{produced}} moderate {{rainfall and}} winds along its path, although impact was greatest in Nicaragua where it moved ashore as a hurricane. A total of 96homes were destroyed, and 1,200people were left homeless. The rainfall resulted in widespread flooding, killing <b>three</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Rivas. In neighboring Costa Rica, Hurricane Irene caused more than $1million (USD) in {{damage to the}} banana crop. Later, the remnants of Hurricane Olivia produced rainfall in the southwest United States. Flooding was reported near Yuma, Arizona, which closed a major highway, and the moisture produced snowfall in higher elevations in the Rocky Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the storm, high {{waves and}} gusty winds led to one {{drowning}} {{when a woman}} was knocked off a ferry in Takamatsu, Kagawa. A landslide in Miyazaki destroyed five homes, killing three people. A man who was listed as missing {{was found dead in}} a flooded rice field. In Tarumi, a landslide buried a home in mud, killing two people. Nabi caused a portion of the San'yō Expressway to collapse in Yamaguchi Prefecture, killing <b>three</b> <b>people.</b> <b>In</b> Fukui Prefecture, the winds knocked an elderly man off a bicycle, killing him. Overall, Nabi killed 29people in Japan and injured 179others, 45 of them severely. Damage was estimated at ¥94.9billion (US$854million).|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the storm, the United States Weather Bureau issued {{widespread}} hurricane warnings, {{resulting in}} 14,000people evacuating southeastern North Carolina. Connie produced strong winds, high tides, and heavy rainfall {{as it moved}} ashore, causing heavy crop damage and 27deaths in the state. Connie tracked roughly along the eastern coast of Virginia before turning northwest, and it progressed inland until dissipating on August15 near Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. Four {{people were killed in}} Washington, D.C. due to a traffic accident. In Chesapeake Bay, Connie capsized a boat, killing 14people and prompting a change in Coast Guard regulation. There were six deaths each in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and eleven deaths in New York, where record rainfall flooded homes and subways. At least 225,000people lost power during the storm. Damage in the United States totaled around $86million, although the rains from Connie contributed to flooding from Hurricane Diane that caused $700million in damage. The remnants of Connie destroyed a few houses and boats in Ontario and killed <b>three</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Ontario.|$|E

5|$|Alex {{caused the}} deaths of at least 51 people along its path, and {{produced}} over $1.8 billion (2010 USD) in damage. The precursor of the hurricane produced substantial rainfall across the Greater Antilles, causing one death in the Dominican Republic. Fourteen {{people were killed in}} Central America as a result of flooding during the first landfall of Alex. In Mexico, the storm's outer rainbands killed <b>three</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Acapulco, one person in Oaxaca, and another in Chiapas. At its final landfall, Alex caused at least fifteen deaths in Nuevo León, eight in Coahuila, six in Guanajuato, and one in both Tamaulipas and San Luis Potosí; an additional twenty persons were reported missing.|$|E
5|$|As the {{hurricane}} moved inland, {{the city of}} Houston was hit especially hard. <b>Three</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the area died and several others were injured. Winds blew at up to , catching many off-guard after a previous forecast that deemed the region was safe. Some sections of the city were left without power. The winds destroyed poorly built structures and damaged others, and some streets were flooded. An athletic stadium was demolished by the storm, and glass windows were shattered in downtown stores. A preliminary estimate placed the damage in Houston at $500,000. In {{the aftermath of the}} storm, fifteen truckloads of shattered glass were removed.|$|E
5|$|Hurricanes Arlene and Chloe, as well {{as several}} {{tropical}} depressions, originated from tropical waves that left the coast of Africa. Chloe lasted for 15days, eventually dissipating over France after wrecking a ship offshore northern Spain, killing 14people. Hurricane Doria co-existed with Beulah and Chloe, taking an unusual trajectory over the eastern United States; it killed <b>three</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> a boating accident offshore New Jersey. In late September, Tropical Storm Edith was a minimal storm that moved through the Lesser Antilles without serious impact. Hurricane Fern killed three people when it struck Mexico north of Tampico. Tropical Storm Ginger existed in the far eastern Atlantic in early October, and Hurricane Heidi stalled over the northern Atlantic Ocean {{at the end of the}} month.|$|E

5|$|Kikai {{had started}} his Asakusa series of square, {{monochrome}} portraits {{as early as}} 1973, but after this there was a hiatus until 1985, {{when he realized that}} an ideal backdrop would be the plain red walls of Sensō-ji. At that time, the great majority of his Asakusa portraits adopted further constraints: the single subject stands {{directly in front of the}} camera (originally a Minolta Autocord TLR, later the Hasselblad), looking directly at it, and is shown from around the knees upwards. Kikai may wait at the temple for four or five hours, hoping to see somebody he wants to photograph, and three or four days may pass without a single photograph; but he may photograph <b>three</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> a single day, and he has photographed over six hundred people in this way. He believes that to have a plain backdrop and a direct confrontation with the subject allows the viewer to see the subject as a whole, and as somebody on whom time is marked, without any distracting or limiting specificity.|$|E
5|$|Martin {{killed at}} least <b>three</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Singapore and Thailand, and may have killed others in Belize, Mexico, and the United States. His modus operandi was to pose as a tourist and {{converse}} with another randomly chosen caucasian, either aboard their flights or while waiting at airports. He stayed in the same hotels as his victims in a room near theirs. Once he had an excuse {{to be in their}} rooms, he used an electroshock weapon to immobilise them before killing them by striking their heads with a hammer and cutting them up in their bathrooms. He chose caucasians as his victims because they were vacationing far away from their home countries, which made him less likely to be discovered. His motive apparently included money, as large amounts were withdrawn using the credit cards of Gerard Lowe and Timothy MacDowall.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the hurricane's {{landfall}} in Nicaragua, the country's army evacuated about 500people from {{a settlement}} near Bluefields, {{and along the}} coastline, boats were advised to remain at port. When it moved ashore, the hurricane produced sustained winds of 46mph (74km/h) in Bluefields. The winds destroyed 27houses in the region. Observations were not available in the sparsely populated region near where Irene moved ashore, although winds were believed to have reached hurricane force there. Reconnaissance planes reported heavy structural and tree damage in southeastern Nicaragua. Satellite imagery suggested that heavy rainfall occurred from Panama through Honduras, and one location in Nicaragua reported more than 6.3inches (160mm) of precipitation. The rainfall caused flooding in many communities, killing <b>three</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Rivas. At least five rivers reported flooding; along one of the rivers, 35houses were inundated, and along another, the floodwaters swept away all of the crops and personal belongings of three villages. Across the country, the hurricane destroyed 96homes, and 1,200people were left homeless. In Costa Rica, Irene's passage resulted in more than $1million (USD) in damage to the banana crop.|$|E

5|$|Severe Tropical Storm Mekkhala, {{also known}} as Tropical Storm Amang, killed <b>three</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the Bicol Region of the Philippines. Damage in the region {{amounted}} to ₱318.7million (US$7.1million), stemming mostly from agriculture. In addition, the storm caused agricultural damage of ₱30.3million (US$680,000) in Samar. The crop damage and a subsequent drought caused rice shortages in the country, prompting the government to import the grain in May 2015. Throughout the country, 48homes were destroyed while a further 490sustained damage. Infrastructural losses reached ₱49.7million (US$1.1million); repairs to roadways was quick and completed by January21. A volunteer from the Bicol Region, who worked for a Catholic Relief Services station in Salcedo, Eastern Samar, {{was hit by a}} soundbox due to a collapsed scaffolding caused by heavy winds during a papal Mass held in Daniel Z.

5|$|The 1941 Texas {{hurricane}}, {{the second}} storm of the 1941 Atlantic hurricane season, {{was a large}} and intense tropical cyclone that struck coastal Texas as a major hurricane in September 1941, causing relatively severe damage. The storm is estimated to have formed in the eastern Gulf of Mexico on September16. After attaining hurricane strength, it completed a clockwise loop and turned northwestward. The hurricane continued to strengthen until it made landfall near East Matagorda Bay, Texas, with winds of , but rapidly weakened as it headed inland. Damage from the storm amounted to about $6.5 million, and crops throughout the region were largely destroyed. The city of Houston suffered extensive damage as the storm passed to the east. The hurricane disrupted activities related to the Louisiana Maneuvers. Later, the system became extratropical and passed over Lake Huron, killing <b>three</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Toronto. Overall, seven people lost their lives due to the cyclone.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} affected 507,831people on the island; {{it resulted}} in 16deaths14of which confirmedand 42injuries. In Saint Andrew Parish's Sandy Park, a house next to a street gully succumbed {{to the effects of}} the storm; five bodies were recovered near the site, while the final missing inhabitant was presumed dead. Elsewhere in Saint Andrew, three construction workers were killed when the shed in which they were sleeping caved in. A girl was crushed to death under the weight of a collapsed board house in Saint Catherine Parish. Rushing waters swept away <b>three</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> different parts of the island, all of whom drowned. Amid a microburst, a waterspout tore roofs off buildings and hospitalized five residents in Westmoreland Parish's capital of Savanna-la-Mar, while to the northwest, strong gusts and rough surf impacted the resort town of Negril. In the wake of the storm, a body was recovered from debris along a road in Saint Catherine. Flooded streets, roads and bridges isolated communities across seven of the island's parishes and trapped hundreds of residents in their homes.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{striking}} Iran, Gonu dropped {{moderate to}} heavy rainfall, including 74mm (2.91in) {{in the city}} of Chabahar. Winds reached 111km/h (69mph), which caused power outages and damaged some homes made of clay; the power outage led to some fires across the city. The rainfall flooded at least 40houses, and resulted in the temporary closure of several major roads. Cyclone Gonu produced a storm tide of 2m (6.5ft) in some locations, with many homes near the coastline receiving damage. In Jask, heavy rainfall overflowed a river, killing <b>three</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> a vehicle caught in the water. Flooding from the rainfall also destroyed a dam in Nikshahr County.

5|$|On February 23, 1991, {{at about}} 8:23 PM, a fire {{began on the}} 22nd floor of the {{building}}. It was a Saturday night and there were only <b>three</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the building at the time, an engineer and two security guards. Workers had been refinishing woodwork in a vacant office {{earlier in the day}} and workers left a pile of rags soaked in linseed oil on the floor. The linseed oil oxidized and generated enough heat to ignite the rags, which then set fire to other solvents nearby. Smoke detectors did not cover the entire floor {{and by the time the}} fire alarm went off the fire was already well established. After the fire alarm sounded in the building the engineer went up to the 22nd floor to investigate. When the elevator reached the 22nd floor the engineer found heavy smoke and heat that prevented him from reaching the elevator controls he needed to return to the lobby. The engineer escaped after radioing to a security guard in the lobby to recall the elevator using fire safety controls there. The second security guard was on the 30th floor when the alarm went off and used the stairwell to get to the ground floor.|$|E

In Saganoseki, a {{motorist}} died after a roadway collapse landed his vehicle {{in a nearby}} river. On Shikoku, Zeb destroyed roads and farmlands and eroded lands along waterways. Three people died due to a landslide in Matsuyama. In Okayama Prefecture along Honshu, Zeb left six people missing or killed and was the costliest typhoon since Typhoon Fran in 1976. Landslides killed <b>three</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Hiroshima Prefecture. Power outages and landslides affected much of Honshu, while strong winds damaged many fields. A cargo freighter washed aground amid high waves in Shizuoka Prefecture, causing oil to leak and requiring assistance from the Coast Guard; oil recovery equipment {{was sent to the}} area to clean the spill. Lastly, Zeb affected the northern island of Hokkaido, causing one landslide, damaging 152buildings, and knocking 152,000apples to the ground. Nationwide, Zeb destroyed 770homes and flooded another 12,548, with thousands forced to evacuate their homes due to flooding.
