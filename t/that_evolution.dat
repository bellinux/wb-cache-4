5|$|A related {{objection}} is <b>that</b> <b>evolution</b> {{is based}} on unreliable evidence, claiming <b>that</b> <b>evolution</b> is not even well-evidenced. Typically, this is either based on the argument that evolution's evidence is full of frauds and hoaxes, that current evidence for evolution {{is likely to be}} overturned as some past evidence has been, or that certain types of evidence are inconsistent and dubious.|$|E
5|$|Michael Shermer {{argued in}} Scientific American in October 2006 <b>that</b> <b>evolution</b> {{supports}} concepts like family values, avoiding lies, fidelity, moral codes {{and the rule}} of law. He goes on to suggest <b>that</b> <b>evolution</b> gives more support to the notion of an omnipotent creator, rather than a tinkerer with limitations based on a human model, the more common image subscribed to by creationists. Careful analysis of the creationist charges <b>that</b> <b>evolution</b> has led to moral relativism and the Holocaust yields the conclusion that these charges appear to be highly suspect. Such analyses conclude that the origins of the Holocaust {{are more likely to be}} found in historical Christian anti-Semitism than in evolution.|$|E

5000|$|The pro-{{intelligent}} design organization, the Discovery Institute, states <b>that</b> Science, <b>Evolution,</b> and Creationism [...] "completely misrepresents intelligent design" [...] and [...] "exaggerates {{the success}} of evolution". Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, argues <b>that</b> Science, <b>Evolution,</b> and Creationism [...] "ignores" [...] criticism of [...] "Darwinism".|$|R
5|$|Supporters of {{evolution}} have argued in response that no scientist's claims {{are treated as}} sacrosanct, {{as shown by the}} aspects of Darwin's theory that have been rejected or revised by scientists over the years to form first neo-Darwinism and later the modern evolutionary synthesis. The claim <b>that</b> <b>evolution</b> relies on faith is likewise rejected on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>evolution</b> has strong supporting evidence, and therefore does not require faith.|$|E
5|$|The {{arguments}} for evolution being a religion generally amount to arguments by analogy: {{it is argued}} <b>that</b> <b>evolution</b> and religion have one or more things in common, and that therefore evolution is a religion. Examples of claims made in such arguments are statements <b>that</b> <b>evolution</b> is based on faith, and that supporters of evolution dogmatically reject alternative suggestions out-of-hand. These claims have become more popular {{in recent years as}} the neo-creationist movement has sought to distance itself from religion, thus giving it more reason to make use of a seemingly anti-religious analogy.|$|E
5|$|A common neo-creationist {{objection}} to evolution is <b>that</b> <b>evolution</b> does not adhere to normal scientific standards—that {{it is not}} genuinely scientific. It is argued that evolutionary biology does not follow the scientific method and therefore should not be taught in science classes, or at least should be taught alongside other views (i.e., creationism). These objections often deal with {{the very nature of}} evolutionary theory, the scientific method, and philosophy of science.|$|E

40|$|It is {{commonly}} said <b>that</b> Darwinian <b>evolution</b> conflicts with theistic religion. Those who say such things often {{have in mind}} claims that are peripheral to theistic religion, for example, the claim that God created the earth about 6, 000 years ago or the claim that God directly created each species. I {{have no interest in}} the thesis <b>that</b> Darwinian <b>evolution</b> conflicts with these peripheral claims. I do have an interest, however, in the thesis <b>that</b> Darwinian <b>evolution</b> conflicts with claims that are central to theistic religion. Among those who say <b>that</b> Darwinian <b>evolution</b> conflicts with claims central to theistic religion, we find those who say that it is incompatible with them and those who say that, although there is no incompatibility, evolution nevertheless provides significant evidence against them. In this essay, I will focus on the second group. 1 More narrowly, I will focus on Paul Draper’s argument for this conclusion. ...|$|R

5|$|A fourth reason {{concerns}} students {{rather than}} researchers: Gonzalez Galli argues that since people naturally imagine <b>that</b> <b>evolution</b> has a purpose or direction, then {{the use of}} teleological language by scientists may act {{as an obstacle to}} students when learning about natural selection.

5|$|Assuming for the {{purposes}} of argument, however, <b>that</b> <b>evolution</b> is a religion or religious tenet, the remedy is to stop the teaching of evolution, not establish another religion in opposition to it.

5|$|In 1950, the German {{paleontologist}} Otto Schindewolf {{argued that}} variation tends {{to move in}} a predetermined direction.

5|$|Other common {{objections}} to evolution allege <b>that</b> <b>evolution</b> leads to objectionable results, including bad beliefs, behaviors, and events. It {{is argued that}} {{the teaching of evolution}} degrades values, undermines morals, and fosters irreligion or atheism. These may be considered appeals to consequences (a form of logical fallacy), as the potential ramifications of belief in evolutionary theory {{have nothing to do with}} its objective empirical reality.|$|E
5|$|Punctuated {{equilibrium}} {{is commonly}} contrasted against phyletic gradualism, the idea <b>that</b> <b>evolution</b> generally occurs uniformly {{and by the}} steady and gradual transformation of whole lineages (called anagenesis).

5|$|Some of {{the oldest}} and most common {{objections}} to evolution dispute whether evolution can truly account for all the apparent complexity and order in the natural world. It is argued <b>that</b> <b>evolution</b> is too unlikely or otherwise lacking to account for various aspects of life, and therefore that an intelligence, such as God of the Abrahamic religions, must at the very least be appealed to for those specific features.|$|E

Hovind's son Eric Hovind claims <b>that</b> <b>evolution</b> is responsible for tattoos, body piercing, premarital sex, unwed births, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), divorce, and child abuse.|$|E
50|$|Thus, Plantinga argued, the {{probability}} that our minds are reliable under a conjunction of philosophical naturalism and naturalistic evolution is low or inscrutable. Therefore, to assert <b>that</b> naturalistic <b>evolution</b> is true also asserts that one has a low or unknown probability of being right. This, Plantinga argued, epistemically defeats the belief <b>that</b> naturalistic <b>evolution</b> is true and that ascribing truth to naturalism and evolution is internally dubious or inconsistent.|$|R

5|$|A common {{claim of}} creationists is <b>that</b> <b>evolution</b> {{has never been}} observed. Challenges to such {{objections}} often come down to debates over how evolution is defined (see the Defining evolution section above). Under the conventional biological definition of evolution, {{it is a simple}} matter to observe evolution occurring. Evolutionary processes, in the form of populations changing their genetic composition from generation to generation, have been observed in different scientific contexts, including the evolution of fruit flies, mice, and bacteria in the laboratory, and of tilapia in the field. Such studies on experimental evolution, particularly those using microorganisms, are now providing important insights into how evolution occurs, {{especially in the case of}} antibiotic resistance.|$|E
5|$|A {{statement}} is considered falsifiable {{if there is}} an observation or a test that could be made that would demonstrate that the {{statement is}} false. Statements that are not falsifiable cannot be examined by scientific investigation since they permit no tests that evaluate their accuracy. Creationists such as Henry M. Morris have claimed that any observation can be fitted into the evolutionary framework, so it is impossible to demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>evolution</b> is wrong and therefore evolution is non-scientific.|$|E
5|$|An area {{of current}} {{investigation}} in evolutionary developmental biology is the developmental basis of adaptations and exaptations. This research addresses {{the origin and}} evolution of embryonic development and how modifications of development and developmental processes produce novel features. These studies have shown <b>that</b> <b>evolution</b> can alter development to produce new structures, such as embryonic bone structures that develop into the jaw in other animals instead forming part {{of the middle ear}} in mammals. It is also possible for structures that have been lost in evolution to reappear due to changes in developmental genes, such as a mutation in chickens causing embryos to grow teeth similar to those of crocodiles. It is now becoming clear that most alterations in the form of organisms are due to changes in a small set of conserved genes.|$|E
