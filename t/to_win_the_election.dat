5|$|He went on <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> for {{his seat}} in 1936, 1943 and 1947. When al-Atassi became {{president}} in 1936, al-Bakri became the chief leader of the National Bloc. The following year, he was appointed by al-Atassi to serve as Governor of Jabal al-Arab. In 1938, he defected from the National Bloc to join the rival People's Party led by his former colleague al-Shahbandar. In the short-lived 1939 cabinet of Prime Minister Lutfi al-Haffar, Bakri was made justice minister, while in Prime Minister Khalid al-Azm's cabinet he served as national economy and agriculture minister.|$|E
5|$|After Southern Democrats {{walked out}} of the 1860 Democratic National Convention, the party's {{northern}} and southern factions held rival conventions in Baltimore that nominated Douglas and Breckinridge, respectively, for president. A third party, the Constitutional Union Party, nominated John Bell. These three men split the Southern vote, while more anti-slavery Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln won all but three electoral votes in the North, allowing him <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b> Breckinridge carried most of the Southern states. Taking his seat in the Senate, Breckinridge urged compromise to preserve the Union. Unionists were in control of the state legislature, and gained more support when Confederate forces moved into Kentucky.|$|E

50|$|Berríos {{decided not}} to run for mayor again in 1996, being {{substituted}} by William Miranda Marín as PPD leader in Caguas. Miranda Marín went on <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> that year.|$|R
5|$|As the 15th Lok Sabha {{was due to}} {{complete}} its constitutional term on 31 May 2014, a general election was called by the Election Commission for {{the constitution of the}} 16th Lok Sabha. The election was held in nine phases from 7 April to 12 May 2014. The Congress party had won the previous two elections in 2004 and 2009, and so was campaigning <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> for the third consecutive time. The result of this election were declared on 16 May, before the 15th Lok Sabha completed its constitutional mandate on 31 May 2014.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{finished}} third in the popular vote with 849,781 votes to Lincoln's 1,866,452, Douglas's 1,379,957, and Bell's 588,879. He carried 12 of the 15 Southern states and the border states of Maryland, Delaware and North Carolina but lost his home state to Bell. His greatest support in the Deep South came from areas that opposed secession. Davis pointed out that only Breckinridge garnered nearly equal support from the Deep South, the border states, and the free states of the North. His 72 electoral votes bested Bell's 59 and Douglas's 12, but Lincoln received 180, enough <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 27 December 2007, {{a general}} {{election}} was held in Kenya, comprising parliamentary, presidential and civic elections. The incumbent President, Mwai Kibaki, who represents the Party of National Unity and Raila Odinga from the Orange Democratic Movement were the leading candidates. Early indications showed that Odinga was likely <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> however the results announced by the Electoral Commission of Kenya showed that Kibaki had been re-elected and he {{was sworn in as}} President. Immediately after the Electoral Commission's announcement, Odinga rejected the result, claiming that widespread electoral fraud had taken place. European Union electoral observers also claimed that the electoral commission had failed to ensure the credibility of the vote.|$|E
50|$|The UPFA went on <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>elections,</b> {{securing}} 52% of {{the popular}} vote and 20 of the 37 seats in the Provincial Council. Chandrakanthan also <b>won</b> <b>the</b> most number of preferential votes in the Batticaloa District.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> general <b>elections</b> in April 1948 {{were heavily}} {{influenced}} by the cold-war confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States. After the Soviet-inspired February 1948 communist coup in Czechoslovakia, the US became alarmed about Soviet intentions and feared that, if the leftist coalition were <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>elections,</b> <b>the</b> Soviet-funded Italian Communist Party (PCI) would draw Italy into the Soviet Union's sphere of influence.|$|R
50|$|General {{elections}} {{were held in}} Northern Rhodesia on 20 March 1959, although voting {{did not take place}} in two constituencies until 9 April.

5|$|The bad {{economic}} times had continued, and strengthened {{the hand of}} forces for free silver. The issue bitterly divided the Democratic Party; President Cleveland firmly supported the gold standard, but {{an increasing number of}} rural Democrats wanted silver, especially in the South and West. The silverites took control of the 1896 Democratic National Convention and chose William Jennings Bryan for president; he had electrified the delegates with his Cross of Gold speech. Bryan's financial radicalism shocked bankers—they thought his inflationary program would bankrupt the railroads and ruin the economy. Hanna approached them for support for his strategy <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> and they gave $3.5 million for speakers and over 200million pamphlets advocating the Republican position on the money and tariff questions.|$|E
5|$|Twenty years later, in 1930, Governor Huey Long would {{rail against}} this loss {{when he ran}} for the office of U.S. Senator against {{incumbent}} Joseph E. Ransdell. In a circular distributed by his campaign to the citizens of New Orleans, Long listed the loss of the Mint as the very first of many complaints against Ransdell's lengthy service record in the Senate. Long went on <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> although he did not take office until his term as governor expired in 1932. At some point, however, the original New Orleans machinery was lost, and, at present, has not been located.|$|E
5|$|Clay {{believed}} the Democrats would again nominate Martin Van Buren, who was ardently opposed to annexation, {{and this would}} keep annexation from becoming {{an issue in the}} campaign. Clay was nominated by acclamation at the Whig convention in Baltimore a week later. At the Democratic nominating convention a month later, however, Van Buren was unable to secure his party's nomination, and the Democrats instead nominated James K. Polk, who strongly favored annexation. Clay tried to moderate his views on annexation, but his changes of position drew opposition from supporters of {{both sides of the issue}} as he attempted to find a middle ground. Polk went on <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> in a close race. This was the last time Clay would be nominated for president, and many Whigs believed that, following Clay's defeat, Crittenden was the new leader of their party.|$|E
50|$|The NFP re-united for <b>the</b> 1982 <b>elections</b> {{and came}} close <b>to</b> <b>winning</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> by <b>winning</b> 24 seats in {{coalition}} with the Western United Front (WUF).

50|$|In 1998, before <b>the</b> {{parliamentary}} <b>elections</b> of 7th Saeima, Tautas partija with Šķēle as {{its chairman}} was founded. It described {{itself as a}} conservative party.

50|$|Mahoney ran for Governor {{again in}} 1962, {{challenging}} incumbent Governor J. Millard Tawes in the Democratic primary. Tawes not only beat Mahoney but went on <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> general <b>election</b> against Republican Frank Small, Jr.. Tawes became thus {{the first and}} only Democrat <b>to</b> <b>win</b> a primary against Mahoney and then go on <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> general <b>election.</b>|$|R
5|$|In September and October 2008, by-elections in the Port Macquarie area at both {{federal and}} state level gave a new forum {{to some of the}} players in the controversy. When the member for the federal seat of Lyne, Mark Vaile, retired from {{politics}} on 30 July 2008, Oakeshott and Drew, the latter standing as the endorsed National Party candidate, emerged as the major candidates in the resulting by-election on 6 September. With the Glasshouse as a major issue, Oakeshott won 63.80% of the primary vote to Drew's 22.88%, with a further 10.07% coming to Oakeshott via preferences. In Oakeshott's old state seat of Port Macquarie, former Councillors Jamie Harrison and Lisa Intemann ran as independents, between them attracting 15.8% of the vote, whilst former Oakeshott staffer Peter Besseling went on <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> against the endorsed National candidate.|$|E
5|$|Since November 2002, by-elections {{have been}} held to fill vacancies. Two by-elections were held in 2003, one in 2004, four in 2005, one in each of 2007, 2008 and 2009, two in 2010, four in 2011, two in 2013, four in 2014, six in 2015, two in 2016 and two in 2017. Voting is by {{preferential}} voting, with peers ranking the candidates in order of preference. As many or as few preferences as desired may be indicated. <b>To</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> a peer must receive a majority of first preference votes. If no candidate receives such a majority, the candidate with the fewest number of first preference votes is eliminated, with each of his votes being redistributed according to the second preference marked on the ballot (see Instant-runoff voting). The process is continued until one candidate receives a majority.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to explore how the {{connection}} between political ideology and voters’ preferences is able to generate different equilibria in a yardstick competition game, where good incumbents are forced to create a bad reputation or, in other words, to mimic the bad incumbents’ behavior in order <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> in a two-candidate political competition. ...|$|R
