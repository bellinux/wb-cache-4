Therefore, this study focuses on the cause of problems in the management of school discipline, the role of parents in assisting the management of school discipline, the criteria that should be possessed before one is to be appointed as a discipline teacher, training required by the discipline teachers, and the role of school management in assisting the management of school discipline. The data was obtained through questionnaires and interviews. The data obtained were analyzed using SPSS software and data from interview had been analyzed using <b>thematic</b> <b>procedure</b> and conclusion. The study found that there were eight causes of problems in discipline management. The findings had also identified twelve important criteria, which a teacher should posses before been appointed as a discipline teacher.

40|$|The {{government}} of Laos has carried out regressive organizational {{changes in its}} electric power sector including deregulation, decentralization, and devolution. As governmental agencies attempt to improve their organization, little is understood about the impact these changes have on the electric sector. Using Burke 2 ̆ 7 s organization change theory as the foundation, {{the purpose of this}} qualitative study was to explain the impact of organizational change on rural electrification in the Champassak Province, Laos. Data were collected through semistructured interviews with 20 participants representing governmental agencies, private entities, and nongovernmental organizations. Data were also collected through observation of a public consultative meeting and reviewing of publicly available documents, both of which were related to electrification. Data were inductively coded and analyzed using a <b>thematic</b> <b>procedure.</b> According to the study findings, organizational change helped expand electrification at the early stage. However, shortcomings such as setting onerous tax rates and promulgating convoluted laws by the public sector have caused static growth in both the trend of project finance and electrification recently. The positive social change implications stemming from this study include recommendations to local policy makers and legislators to tailor the fiscal policy and statutes, which may support wider electrification efforts in the Champassak Province...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To explore {{foundation}} trainees' {{experiences with}} the mini clinical evaluation exercise (mini-CEX). Methods: Data were gathered from interviews with thirty foundation year one trainees who had completed a minimum of six assessments with the mini-CEX tool. Interview transcripts were analysed using a template <b>thematic</b> <b>procedure.</b> Results: Trainees reported divergent views regarding the goals and the standard of the assessment. Surface and strategic approaches were the commonly reported approaches to the mini clinical assessment. Assessment standards were frequently subverted in favour of retrospective, ad hoc and absentia approaches. Non-specific feedback was common and explicit action plans were infrequent. All trainees applauded the formative potential of the mini-CEX but there were mixed perceptions of its educational value. Some considered it useful and spoke of their positive experiences in terms of theoretical knowledge, clinical competencies and daily clinical practice. Others considered their experiences unremarkable; and some other respondents felt mini-CEX was valueless, and described it as an administrative burden. Respondents felt that, trainee's personality, maturity and learning style, ambiguity {{in the use of}} assessment result, assessor's skills and attitude, and the clinical environment, were important to their experiences with mini-CEX. Conclusions: The trainees recognised the potential of the mini-CEX. Adequate knowledge about the assessment standard and guidelines were generally lacking. There was perceived tension between mini-CEX formative and summative purposes. This and other contextual factors probably shaped the trainees' experiences with mini-CEX...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} registered nurses' (RNs') perceptions of factors influencing care for patients in the palliative phase of end-stage heart failure (ESHF). Seventeen senior RNs across 3 acute care and 5 community centres in metropolitan Adelaide, Australia, participated in the study. In this descriptive, exploratory research project, we analyzed audiotaped indepth, semistructured interviews, using a computer-assisted (NVIVO) <b>thematic</b> <b>procedure.</b> According to participants, the care of patients with ESHF is dominated by a focus on symptom management and optimal pharmacologic therapies, with a perceived deficit in other aspects of palliative management. Key mitigating factors against quality palliative care for this population included the difficulty in recognising ESHF and reluctance by physicians to negotiate end-of-life decisions. In the acute care sector, nurses believed ESHF was medicalized and characterized by paternalistic care, with treatment generally curative to the last breath. Nursing care and patient advocacy were also negatively influenced by a lack of awareness in patients and families concerning the inevitability of death in ESHF until the last few days or hours before death. Involvement of the palliative care team was often an afterthought rather than an integral component of care. Nurses in acute care settings embraced the concept of a multidisciplinary team approach, but stressed the need for the cardiac team to be the overall coordinator of care for the ESHF population. Care of patients with ESHF should promote the amalgamation of technological and pharmaceutical advances in the treatment of heart failure with more timely end-of-life care. All involved parties must work toward advancing a common middle ground for appropriate end-of-life care for patients with ESHF. Recommendations for practice include the need for greater education for patients and their families and greater collaboration between the members of the multidisciplinary healthcare team to assist patients with ESHF and their families prepare more timely for the final trajectory of the illness.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{so-called}} "thematic approach" {{as a method}} available to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights to take cognizance of and to react upon {{violations of human rights}} worldwide. To this end, three different thematic procedures, the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the Special Rapporteur on Torture and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, have been subjected to detailed scrutiny. The analysis takes as a point of departure the apparent contradiction between the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, where human rights have been proclaimed as one of the Organisation's main purposes and where, at the same time, the principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of a State seems to preclude its effective implementation. The study shows how the practice of the political organs of the United Nations, particularly the practice of the General Assembly, ECOSOC, the Commission on Human Rights and its Sub-Commission, gradually shaped the meaning and scope of the principle of non-intervention, confirming the relativity of the concept of domestic jurisdiction and establishing - through ECOSOC Resolutions 1235 and 1503 - essential human rights monitoring competences for the Commission on Human Rights. Subsequently, it shows how the Commission on Human Rights used these competences to establish so-called country-specific procedures to study and report on the human rights situation in one specific country and how the selectivity inherent to this method led it to take a different approach in 1980 as it established its first <b>thematic</b> <b>procedure</b> to study one particular phenomenon of human rights violations worldwide: the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances. The analysis of the three selected thematic procedures reviews in detail their establishment, the development of working methods and techniques such as routine transmissions, urgent appeals, on-site visits and annual reports and concludes that since 1980 thematic procedures have managed to establish, consolidate and institutionalise their working methods within the United Nations system of human rights protection. At the same time, it also concludes that the effectiveness - the ability "to produce a desired effect" - of the thematic approach must be deemed extremely limited. In the light of these two conclusions, the study undertakes to initiate a discussion concerning the supposed changing nature of the international legal order: a move away from the so-called "statist presumption" of international law towards a vision of international law governing a constitutional order presenting more and more hierarchical features. The author concludes that, notwithstanding the desirability of achieving this objective, it is premature to assume such a change of paradigm...|$|E

40|$|Integral to {{building}} a positive workplace environment is the leader’s ability to grow supportive employee relationships and apply insightful strategies to achieve desired results. Leadership strategies, including use of power and influence, reflect a complex amalgam of professional experiences, practices, and personal culture. Much of the current scholarly literature examines the effect of workplace diversity through an organizational lens, focusing on the employee experience and the advantages and challenges of the diverse labor force to the organization. While some existing studies offer insight into specific populations of employees (Opsina 2 ̆ 6 Foldy, 2009; Qiadan, Tziner, 2 ̆ 6 Waismel-Manor, 2011), few have been directed at {{the way in which}} individual minority leaders experience their power and how this is exercised in their choice of influence strategies. Expanding on a previous pilot study, this study utilizes a phenomenological approach using a constructivist lens, incorporating how the life experiences of 13 minority leaders inform the leadership strategies and interpersonal employee interactions with those these leaders currently employ. The study applied Moustakas’ (1994) structured <b>thematic</b> <b>procedures</b> of data analysis of transcripts from semistructured interviews, resulting in four emergent themes, each reflecting a series of aligned concepts. Emergent themes of defining experiences and influences, connecting with their current self, connecting with employees/others, and connecting with their organizations were explored through the voices of the individual leaders.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{some of the}} significant institutional and legal developments in the African human rights system between July 2004 and December 2006. 1 During this period, measured progress {{was made by the}} African Union on the establishment of an African Court of Human and Peoples' Rights ('African Court'). The <b>thematic</b> <b>procedures</b> of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights ('Commission') were engaged more extensively than before, culminating in the adoption by the Commission of country resolutions on the situation of human rights in Ethiopia, Sudan, Uganda and Zimbabwe. These country resolutions generated, for the first time, direct confrontation between the Assembly of the Heads of State and Government of the African Union ('Assembly') and the Commission at a Summit of the Assembly held in Khartoum in January 2006. As a result, the Commission's 19 th Annual Activity Report that had contained these resolutions was embargoed by the Assembly. These resolutions were released later in the 20 th Annual Activity Report after Ethiopia, Sudan, Uganda and Zimbabwe had formally responded to the Commission. During the period under review, the Commission also sought to enhance its capacity by reviewing its status, mandate and independence in the framework of the African Union and developed the practice of exposing the imperfect record of periodic reporting by States Parties to the African Charter on Human and the Peoples' Rights 1981 ('African Charter'). 2 The growing number of individual complaints on the docket of the Commission was also apparent, and three of the Commission's most important decisions made in the period under review are discussed subsequently...|$|R

Women are often the victims of IPV, and millions of children are exposed to it annually. The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore experiences of Puerto Rican mothers and their perceptions of how IPV exposure may have impacted their children using resilience theory. Data were collected via audiotaped individual interviews with 9 Puerto Rican mothers who endured an array of escalating IPV, often exacerbated by the perpetrators use of alcohol or drugs, and had IPV-exposed children aged 6 - 11 years. Data analysis integrated content and <b>thematic</b> <b>procedures.</b> Interview data was transcribed, read, audited and coded based on compelling statements, quotes, and sentences made by the participants. The coded clusters were further evaluated, reduced to significant statements, then grouped into themes that captured the essence of the participants lived experiences and of the group. The mothers separated because they feared for their lives and the effect of IPV on the children. Once separated the mothers felt isolated, lived in shelters which were unconducive to childrearing, and had challenges navigating the system. They perceived their IPV-exposed children exhibited a multitude of behaviors including PTSD but that most were showing signs of resilience. Their IPV was perpetrated by males who were mostly the biological fathers of their children who used controlling behaviors towards the kids. The potential positive social change impact of this study is to empower Puerto Rican mothers to disclose IPV and to better inform health care providers regarding the impact of IPV on children aged 6 - 11 years in an effort to increase the health, well-being, and resiliency of this vulnerable population...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} verticality in American narratives from 1900 to the present day, proposing that in this period vertical imagery is both conspicuous and under-interrogated. It proceeds from the assertion that American texts after 1900 {{do not conform to}} a traditional model in which 'up' is fixedly attached to positive ideas and, conversely, 'down' is made inextricable from negative concepts. This thesis considers the ways in which images of flying, falling, vertical collapse, and the inversion of what is up and down participate in discourses surrounding what might be termed the concretely vertical - in particular, the skyscraper, the oil derrick, and aviation. It argues that the energies previously attached to westward expansion were siphoned into vertical space after the closure of the frontier. Further, it contends that while the occurrence of imagery has reached new prominence after the distressing verticality of 11 September 200 I, post- 9 fll texts in fact illuminate the significance of representations of verticality across the twentieth century. This thesis considers a range of media, focussing on Winsor McCay's graphic work and animated films (1900 - 1917), Upton Sinclair's novel Oil! (1927), Alien Ginsberg's poetry and prose (1947 - 97), Toni Morrison's Sula (1973), Leslie Marmon Silko's Almanac of the Dead (1991), and the documentary film Man on Wire (2008). It examines a variety of discourses and places them in conversation with one another while maintaining the specificity of their formal and <b>thematic</b> <b>procedures.</b> It poses a model of cultural retroactivity to illuminate the way in which verticality recurs in the period after 1900 as an intertextual image initiating dialogue between apparently disparate moments that are nonetheless united by an underlying sense of disorientation in the face of cultural, technological, or epistemological change.

30|$|Following <b>thematic</b> {{analysis}} <b>procedures,</b> we {{read the}} transcripts several times {{to become familiar with}} the data and generate initial codes (Braun and Clarke 2006). Employing the intersectionality framework (Bowleg 2012), in our analysis, general codes on gambling (e.g. “gambling motivation”) were associated with specific cultural codes (e.g. “gift-giving”) to generate intersecting themes. Themes were identified at a latent rather than at a semantic level, as an interpretive process was used (Boyatzis 1998) to identify underlying contexts. In our analysis, a theme’s relevance was not based on its frequency within the data set, but rather on its importance (Braun and Clarke 2006) for highlighting a culture-gambling intersection. This method enabled identification of a broad range of culture-gambling intersecting themes related to gambling harms. To ensure credibility and auditability, themes are substantiated with excerpts from the raw data (Greenhalgh and Taylor 1997; Long and Godfrey 2004). To ensure authenticity, alterations to enhance sentence readability were kept minimal and participants’ exact words are provided without corrections to grammar.|$|R

40|$|Final Report [...] March 2011 {{conducted}} by Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education for National Center for Environmental Health Radiation Studies Branch U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Background: In 2009 - 2010, the Nuclear Detonation Response Communications Working Group, a federal interagency group of communications and radiation technical experts, developed key messages for affected communities, {{as well as}} the rest of the nation, to be used during the immediate aftermath of an Improvised Nuclear Device (IND) detonation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was part of the interagency group that developed the key messages for communities affected by the detonation of an IND. To help ensure the quality of those messages, CDC, in partnership with the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) set out to test selected messages with the public. Methods: In January 2011, fifteen 90 -minute focus groups were conducted to explore the relevance, comprehensibility, credibility, and effectiveness of the selected messages. A total of 108 adults participated in the focus groups that were conducted in New York City, New York; Washington, D. C.; Chicago, Illinois; Houston, Texas; and Los Angeles, California. After the focus groups, ORISE staff analyzed the demographic data and examined participants 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 transcribed responses using <b>thematic</b> <b>procedures</b> to identify emerging themes from the comments for each message and the overall project.

40|$|Many {{obstacles}} {{still exist}} toward improving safety standards, practices, {{and culture in}} the ready-made garment (RMG) industry in Bangladesh. Workers 2 ̆ 7 beliefs and habits, employers 2 ̆ 7 level of involvement, and gaps in the regulatory framework necessitate an examination of safety practices to build a foundation for safety culture in the workplace. The focus {{of this study was}} to contribute to regulatory reform aimed at creating a safe work environment by exploring the perceptions of workers, employers, and government regulators through the lens of the theory on reciprocal determinism. A total of 41 participants, categorized into three groups of workers, employers, and government regulators, consented to face-to-face interviews. The study provided individual and group perspectives of requirements for safe factories and development of safety culture. Interview data were inductively coded and subjected to a <b>thematic</b> analysis <b>procedure.</b> The results showed the groups collectively prioritized the need for training, collaboration, health, and safety, and they raised concern over civil unrest. The groups differed on the importance placed in areas such as protection of workers, profit, and legal enforcement. The study results can serve to contribute to effective government reform by developing self-efficacy of workers and improve collaboration between workers, employers, and government in the RMG industry of Bangladesh...|$|R
40|$|Juvenile crime among females is on {{the rise}} in the United States and is {{currently}} at an all-time high. Girls who are at risk for committing juvenile crime are at greater risk than boys for experiencing sexual trauma and exploitation as well as depression. Additionally, adolescent females have a higher rate of status-offense reoffending than do adolescent males. Using Kubeka 2 ̆ 7 s conceptualization of trauma theory, the purpose of this case study was to determine whether Everlasting Peace (EP), an evidence-based counseling program in Georgia, successfully provided gender-specific treatment for female juvenile offenders. Data were collected through interviews with 20 parent/guardian of juvenile female offenders who had been referred to EP by the Georgia Department of Juvenile Justice for treatment. These data were inductively coded and then subjected to a <b>thematic</b> analysis <b>procedure.</b> Results suggested that girls who received gender-specific treatment services from EP showed a positive change in behavior. EP addressed trauma, depression, and sexual abuse as seen in these female offenders. This study may contribute to positive social change by making direct policy recommendations to the Georgia Department of Juvenile Justice to enhance and support programming options for girls who have experienced trauma in order to reduce opportunities for future delinquency...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study {{explored}} the psychosocial experiences of adults with hearing loss using the self-regulatory model as a theoretical framework. The primary {{components of the}} model, namely cognitive representations, emotional representations, and coping responses, were examined. Design: Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted. The data were analysed using an established <b>thematic</b> analysis <b>procedure.</b> Study sample: Twenty-five adults with mild-moderate hearing loss from the UK and nine hearing healthcare professionals from the UK, USA, and Canada were recruited via maximum variation sampling. Results: Cognitive representations: Most participants described their hearing loss as having negative connotations and consequences, although they were not particularly concerned about the progression or controllability/curability of the condition. Opinions differed regarding the benefits of understanding the causes of one’s hearing loss in detail. Emotional representations: negative emotions dominated, although some experienced positive emotions or muted emotions. Coping responses: engaged coping (e. g. hearing aids, communication tactics) and disengaged coping (e. g. withdrawal from situations, withdrawal within situations) : both had perceived advantages and disadvantages. Conclusions: This novel application of the self-regulatory model demonstrates {{that it can be}} used to capture the key psychosocial experiences (i. e. perceptions, emotions, and coping responses) of adults with mild-moderate hearing loss within a single, unifying framework...|$|R
40|$|Aim: This study {{investigated}} Australian midwives’ {{responses to the}} commencement of a national registration process, of particular interest was the response of midwives {{to the introduction of}} a separate midwifery register and changes in conditions for annual registration renewal particularly requirements relating to Recency of Practice (RoP) and Continuing Professional Development (CPD). Methods: Ethical approval was provided for a longitudinal case study of midwives across the two initial annual registration renewal cycles following the changes. Data were collected in 2, individual interviews conducted with a purposive sample of twenty midwives drawn from four Australian states. A focus group of four midwives from a fifth state was used to corroborate the preliminary findings which were generated using a <b>thematic</b> analysis <b>procedure.</b> Findings: Findings revealed constructions of a dichotomy of identities between practice roles. These identities exemplified specific practice activities, places and roles to illustrate how competence for registration renewal could be validated. The picture of complexities around practice, roles, and midwifery professional identity influenced midwives’ decision-making around registration renewal processes. Implications: The midwives’ decisions following the changes have had potential significance for individual practitioners, the midwifery profession and maternity services in Australia more generally. The revealed perceptions of identity pose potential implications on the future workforce and direction of maternity services in Australia...|$|R
40|$|In 1990, the Americans with Disability Act (ADA) {{was enacted}} to support {{disabled}} Americans as {{they sought to}} procure equality in society and the workplace. Despite these intentions, full implementation of the ADA has been fraught with court challenges and legislative amendments. As it currently stands, it is unclear {{as to how the}} judicial system is collectively interpreting a qualified disability. Using Clark and Connolly 2 ̆ 7 s interpretation of legal textualism as the theoretical foundation, the purpose of this case study of the Americans with Disabilities Act was to better understand and explore how the judiciary is currently interpreting qualified disability post-ADA amendments. Data for this study included court interpretations and post-ADA amendment cases among the 12 United States Circuit Courts. These data were coded through a multi-stage coding procedure that included evaluating coding, cycle coding, hand coding, and subcoding. Coded data were analyzed using a <b>thematic</b> analysis <b>procedure.</b> The key theme emerging from this study indicated that the ADA amendments still do not promote congressional intent in the judiciary. This study has implications for positive social change by informing Congress, legal practitioners, legal scholars, social scientists, and the disability community on {{the ways in which the}} judiciary is interpreting ADA amendments collectively among the 12 federal circuit courts...|$|R
40|$|Lack of {{positive}} results {{from many of}} the health-education programmes for patients with low-back pain (LBP) is possibly due to the type of health information that may have been presented and the method that had been used. The present study sought to explore health-education needs among individuals with LBP. A qualitative approach that utilised in-depth interviews and a focus-group discussion was used. Data was drawn from ten participants attending physiotherapy treatment due to a non-specific LBP at the Nairobi Hospital Rehabilitation Unit, using purposive sampling. A <b>thematic</b> analysis <b>procedure</b> was used to analyse the data.   The study found the participants’ health education needs to be incongruent with the medical professionals’ assumptions of what the patients’ health education needs were. Deficiencies in explanation of the cause, diagnosis, prognosis, and the appropriate use of health services were found. The findings suggest that a more encompassing model of health education was believed to be more fitting. Since the findings indicate that the individuals with LBP require health education on various aspects, a Rehabilitative Model of health education was probably more pertinent to the individuals. That way, a more encompassing, all-inclusive model of health education would cover on the aspects that were currently neglected. </p...|$|R
