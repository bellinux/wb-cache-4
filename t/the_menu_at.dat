Additionally, a customization section allows the customer to have a personalized Whopper made with ingredients such as jalapeño peppers, steak sauce or blue cheese. The open station differs from the company's usual kitchen model {{in that it is}} in plain sight of the customer instead of being located in the back-end of the store. The intent of the design is to add a sense of showmanship to the concept.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>menu</b> <b>at</b> Pétrus {{is split}} into several fixed price menus, {{containing}} modern French cuisine. It {{has been described}} by Zoe Williams as being distinctly Gordon Ramsay in composition, despite the influences of head chef Sean Burbidge. The meals come with an amuse-bouche, a pre-starter course, and after dinner chocolates in addition to the items listed on the menus themselves. A number of pan fried fish dishes have been on the menu, including mackerel with tomato chutney and a niçoise salad, and a sea bream course served with brown shrimp, samphire and an oyster velouté sauce. Further seafood related dishes include a langoustine and watercress soup entrée which was praised by food critic Jay Rayner.

25|$|The {{movement}} {{against the}} consumption of cat and dog meat was given added impetus by {{the formation of the}} Chinese Companion Animal Protection Network (CCAPN). Having expanded to more than 40 member societies, CCAPN began organizing protests against eating dog and cat meat in 2006, starting in Guangzhou and continuing in more than ten other cities following a positive response from the public. Before the 2008 Beijing Olympics, officials ordered dog meat to be taken off <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> <b>at</b> its 112 official Olympic restaurants to avoid offending visitors from various nations where {{the consumption of}} dog meat is taboo.|$|E
25|$|Following this, he {{attended}} an Oxford Symposium of Food and Cookery {{where he met}} the food historians Marc Meltonville and Richard Fitch, who work at Hampton Court. Later he met a third food historian, Ivan Day and, in consultation with these three, began developing dishes inspired by recipes in historical British cookbooks. The first completed dish based on a historic recipe was Quaking Pudding, which is now on <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> <b>at</b> the Hinds Head. This was followed by Beef Royal and Chocolate Wine, which featured on the Fat Duck menu. The opening of Dinner by Heston Blumenthal presented him with far greater scope for historical cooking, and its menu is composed solely of dishes inspired by the recipes of the past. His 2013 book Historic Heston {{is a collection of}} historical recipes that have appeared on the menus of Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, the Fat Duck and the Hinds Head.|$|E
25|$|The McFlurry is a soft-serve {{ice cream}} dessert that has pieces of candy or cookies mixed into it. The McFlurry was first {{integrated}} into <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> <b>at</b> a Bathurst, New Brunswick, Canada franchisee in 1995 {{and in the}} United States in 1998. The flavors are crushed Oreo, M's Minis, Reese's, or Mars, Incorporated candy bars like Snickers, Twix, Galaxy, etc., Cadbury's candy bars like Twirl, Wispa, Creme Egg, Crunchie etc., Nestlé candy bars like Yorkie, Smarties, Drifter, Rolo, Butterfinger, etc. McDonald's also does limited time only flavors, e.g. for Shrek the Third it released the Ogre-Load flavor. In Australia, they had a special range for their 40 years in Australia celebration. The flavors were double choc fudge, bubblegum squash, strawberry crumble and caramel cookie. Also in Malaysia, a unique flavor called FuseofmyLife is offered to customers. The mixing blade for the dessert is actually a specially designed spoon with a hollow handle that attaches to the mixer spindle (except in Australia and New Zealand where the staff mix it by hand). The blade is used once then given to the customer to use as an eating utensil. Originally test marketed in Hawaii in 1997, it is now available in most of its markets.|$|E

500|$|In 1995, Novak {{introduced}} two successful new products— Crispy Strips (breaded {{strips of}} chicken) and the chicken pot pie— the chain's first major new product launches in almost two years. Novak credits an improved, more [...] "open" [...] relationship with franchisees for {{the introduction of}} the two new items: Crispy Strips were invented by an Arkansas franchisee, and the pot pie was similarly developed alongside franchisees. Meanwhile, less popular items, such as corn muffins, were removed from <b>the</b> <b>menu.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, Enrico scaled back the increasing competition between KFC and its sister companies, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut; Taco Bell had begun offering its own chicken products, and KFC had attacked Pizza Hut in its marketing.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>menu</b> <b>at</b> Schwa {{is hard to}} classify.

[...] Food critic Alan Richman {{describes it}} as [...] "one of a kind... earnest, innocent, irresistible, and imaginative". [...] The menu is famous for using sophisticated ingredients to create, as one critic put it, [...] "poetic courses". [...] Surprising ingredients such as jellyfish, roe, tongue, and offal are found in {{a large number of}} dishes, as are unusual combinations such as oysters and oatmeal. [...] No portion of the meal is spared from experimentation; tomato sorbet finds its way into the salad, while the consommé soup features melon pieces.|$|E

500|$|Bacon {{ice cream}} has been recreated by other chefs in recent years. For example, it appears on <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> <b>at</b> Espai Sucre in Barcelona, a {{restaurant}} that specialises in desserts, with descriptions such as [...] "innovative" [...] and [...] "spectacular". In the United States, bacon {{was one of the}} themes for dessert at the Fancy food show. In 2006, two separate contestants created versions of bacon ice cream in the reality series Top Chef. Celebrity chef Bob Blumer won a Texas ice cream making competition with a bacon ice cream. Originally planning to use candied bacon, he changed at the last moment to do a bacon brittle ice cream. Chef Michael Symon made bacon ice cream in the first season of the Food Network's The Next Iron Chef competition. Andrew Knowlton, a judge, dismissed it as not original. But Symon managed to progress in the competition and eventually win. Burger King rolled out a [...] "bacon sundae", vanilla ice cream with caramel, chocolate, bacon bits, and one strip of bacon, in the summer of 2012 in the US. It was tested in Nashville in April.|$|E
500|$|Dishes served include palate cleansers made {{of vodka}} and green tea, frozen in liquid nitrogen, a snail {{porridge}} that {{was described by}} one food critic as [...] "infamous", and ice creams of both crab, and egg and bacon, each of which resulted in increased media attention for the restaurant. The mock turtle soup has an Alice in Wonderland theme, where a fob watch formed of freeze-dried beef stock covered with gold leaf is dropped into a tea cup and has a beef stock [...] "tea" [...] poured over it that dissolves the gold and the watch. A plate of ox tongue and vegetables is served alongside it to place into the soup. Toast sandwiches are served as a side dish. It had been developed for an appearance on Heston's Feasts, and was afterwards added to <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> <b>at</b> the restaurant. Dishes are served with additional sensory inputs, such as [...] "Sounds of the Sea", a plate of seafood served with a seafood foam {{on top of a}} [...] "beach" [...] of tapioca, breadcrumbs and eel. Alongside the dish, diners are given an iPod to listen to crashing waves whilst they eat. Other additional sensory components include [...] "The smell of the Black Forest" [...] that accompanies a kirsch ice cream.|$|E
