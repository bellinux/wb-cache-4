50|$|There are {{currently}} four technological methods for telephone tracking. Besides an exclusively web-based function, {{it is possible}} to evaluate call numbers using a <b>telephone</b> <b>server</b> solution. In addition, there are a few software providers who support advertisers in telephone tracking.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the {{call-back}} procedure, {{call number}} tracking {{does not include}} any web-based functions but {{is based on a}} <b>telephone</b> <b>server</b> solution. As a rule, advertisers are provided a multitude of service numbers for customer feedback, where land line numbers can also be used. This enables each print ad, each online banner and any number of other advertising media to communicate an individual phone number as a response element.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} system for secure {{telephone}} conferences (stc) over the internet. The system ensures participant authentication via x. 509 certificates, such that every participant of a conference is informed about every other participant. Also, all signaling and media data are encrypted, to ensure confidentiality. The system builds upon the open source <b>telephone</b> <b>server</b> asterisk and standard IP softphones. Those software products are used unaltered. Stc client and server processes reside with softphones and server, respectively, to realize secure conferences. Experiments with our prototype show that the additional network and processor load is low, and that the system scales well for more than 10 participants. 1...|$|E
50|$|In all {{implementations}} {{the server}} takes a query from a client system and resolves it {{to a set}} of agents. This set is sent back to the calling client as response. Clients can be file systems, database management systems, workflow management systems, physical security systems or even <b>telephone</b> <b>servers.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the two-thousands the {{synthesizer}} {{was released}} from the research labs as a commercial product, including a number of editing tools to produce synthetic audio enriched with emotions and it was also released as a SW library for use in various products, from small portable devices such as mobile phones, navigators and palm computers, to multichannel/multilingual <b>telephone</b> <b>servers</b> for (semi)automatic call centers.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{introduces}} a knowledge representation formalism used for annotation of the French MEDIA dialogue corpus {{in terms of}} high level semantic structures. The semantic annotation, worked out according to the Berkeley FrameNet paradigm, is incremental and partially automated. We describe an automatic interpretation process for composing semantic structures from basic semantic constituents using patterns involving words and constituents. This process contains procedures which provide semantic compositions and generate frame hypotheses by inference. The MEDIA corpus is a French dialogue corpus recorded using a Wizard of Oz system simulating a <b>telephone</b> <b>server</b> for tourist information and hotel booking. It had been manually transcribed and annotated at the word and semantic constituent levels. These levels support the automatic interpretation process which provides a high level semantic frame annotation. The Frame based Knowledge Source we composed contains Frame definitions and composition rules. We finally provide some results obtained on the automatically-derived annotation...|$|E
5000|$|A modem {{allows one}} {{computer}} (the client) {{to establish a}} connection to another (the server) by dialing the <b>server's</b> <b>telephone</b> number. This is sometimes viewed as being insecure {{because there is no}} authentication of the call originator. One way to increase security is to enforce a modem callback protocol, which usually proceeds as a series of steps: ...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{emergency}} triage support system {{was taken as}} an example. We develop new call flow style and combine traditional passive call flow. The system is designed by voice menu and users can command services actively. The <b>telephone</b> connect computer <b>server</b> to enter call flow module with ASR and TTS. Then the recognition term come from voice term database. Voice management center is an ER triage decision system...|$|R
5000|$|Another large EDS {{client is}} the United States Navy. In 2000, they won a {{contract}} {{for the creation of}} a US$9 billion Intranet linking the Navy and the Marine Corps, which was set to late 2006, but on March 24, 2006, was extended to 2010, adding $3 billion to the accumulated contract worth. This initiative is known as the Navy Marine Corps Intranet, or simply NMCI. In 2004, NMCI accounted for about 4% of EDS's revenue. NMCI has been called the largest private network in the world, with approximately 400,000 [...] "seats". EDS provided the network, desktops, laptops, <b>servers,</b> <b>telephones,</b> video-conferencing, satellite transceivers, and overall management of the intranet.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how online communities provide space for educational leaders {{to reflect on}} and share the affective side of leadership, discussing implications of online communities in leadership and relating it to Wenger's concept of a community of practice. Using research conducted at the United Kingdom's Open University, the paper argues {{for the use of}} online conferences as part of headteacher support and development. It examines influencing factors in such an online conference facility, the role of group interaction and participation, and the role of moderators in leadership discussions. The University's Leadership Programme for Serving Headteachers included an information communication technology component. Participants had access to a dedicated Website and conference facility. The study examined use of and attitudes toward online conferencing. Data collection involved technical records generated by the University's <b>servers,</b> <b>telephone</b> surveys, online surveys, and an online conference. Respondents appreciated the abilit...|$|R
