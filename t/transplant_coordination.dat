40|$|The {{transplantation}} {{of organs}} and tissues comprised the highlight invention of great {{utility of the}} medicine for the twentieth century. The institution of the transplant coordinator contributed {{to the rise of}} disposable grafts in Greece. From 1997 onwards begins the rise of the disposable graft but this didn’t last for a long time. Contrarily noted that grafts’ number decreased considerably. The aim of this study was the measurement of behavior of Transplant Coordinator in a Intensive Care Unit of General Hospital of Crete. Methodology: For the measurement of behavior of Transplant Coordinator was used as a tool a questionnaire structured in three parts. The sample consisted of 30 nurses that worked in the Intensive Care Unit of hospital. Results: From the nurses that answered the 93 % knew about the institution and the role of transplant coordinator and the 90 % knew who the transplant coordinator in the hospital was. The 60 % of the nurses support that the institution of transplant coordinator contributed in the increase of transplantation. Moreover, the 44 % supports that the transplant Coordinator should be a team composed of nurse, doctor and psychologist. The 60 % of the nurses reports that many patients were lost which were the right donors because of the transplant coordinator’s delinquency to find donors. It must be noted that nurses who were asked the 80 % answered that they had participated in the procedure of transplantation because of Coordinator’s absence. The biggest percent 55 % reports that the coordinator has no interest in <b>transplant’s</b> <b>coordination,</b> the 39 % answered “I don’t know” and the 6 % that the coordinator has many responsibilities. Finally, they evaluate and attach importance to the policies reported in the role of transplant coordinator that would contribute in the increase of transplantation in Greece: education of coordinators, postgraduate title of “coordinator of transplantation”, personnel of ICU, evaluation of coordinators, motives in the coordinators, change coordinator each year. Conclusively: The Transplant Coordinator’s transfers his duties and responsibilities in the nurses of the Intensive Care Unit. Nurses assume the responsibility for the organization of transplant procedure whereas they have never been trained. That means that it will be more easy to be lost patients which were the right donors for transplantation...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} analyse the {{effectiveness}} of implementation of a clinical guide for requesting family informed consent to deceased organ donation for transplantation at the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau (HSCSP). From 1 st January 2011 to 28 th February 2013 there were 52 consecutive brain-dead patients at HSCSP. Fifty-two family interviews took place requesting organ donation for transplantation. In all cases experienced hospital <b>transplant</b> <b>coordination</b> staff performed the family interview. Transplant coordinator case reports are comprehensive records of clinical data {{and the process of}} requesting donation in every family interview. Quantitative descriptive analysis was used to describe the main features of the data. Free text items were analysed using content analysis focusing on contributing factors to consent/refusal for organ donation. A retrospective case note review (secondary analysis) was carried out for 52 referrals during this audit period. These were also compared with data from the period of 1994 - 2010 before the clinical guide was implemented. Percentage difference of family refusal before and after clinical guide implementation was used in the statistical analysis of data. The percentage of family refusals before and after clinical guide implementation was 17. 5 % (95 % confidence interval, 14. 7 to 20. 3) and 1. 9 % (95 % confidence interval, 0. 04 to 10. 3), respectively, reaching statistical significance (p= 0. 001).

A recent technique called sequential transplant or domino liver transplant (DLT) allows the transplantation of a patient with chronic liver disease by implantation of a full-size liver derived from a patient with familial amyloidosis polyneuropathy (FAP) who receives a cadaveric graft. Therefore, it is possible to transplant two patients with only one cadaveric liver.

40|$|BackgroundLack {{of family}} consent {{from family members}} {{has been a major}} {{obstacle}} to cadaveric organ donation in Hong Kong. Donation decisions for families take place within an intricate web of tragedy, technology and uncertainty. Families' feelings about death, religious preferences and their attitudes towards organ donation greatly influence their experience of the decision-making on donation. Therefore, it is worthwhile to explore Hong Kong cadaveric donor families' experience in the process of decision-making within a Chinese cultural framework. MethodsConvenience sampling was used. Twenty-nine donor families were drawn from the list of the <b>Transplant</b> <b>Coordination</b> Service at four Hong Kong public hospitals. Inclusion criteria were Cantonese-speaking Chinese residing in Hong Kong, who gave their consent to donate their relatives' organ. The donor families were asked on their retrospective perceptions and experience during and after the decision-making. Results: Thirteen participants were recruited and given a semi-structured interview. All the participants were female. The family relationships to the donors were wives, mothers, daughters and siblings. They had given consent to the organ donation. These families' experience of the donation procedure included an inability to comprehend brain death, confusion, stress and uncertainty. The informational and emotional needs were also stressed in donor families during and after donation, while emotional issues after donation were clearly identified. ConclusionAmong Hong Kong Chinese families that offer organ donation, decision-making is influenced by deeply embedded Chinese beliefs. It is recommended that healthcare professionals should have cultural sensitivity and competence in assisting donation discussions in order to meet their patients' needs, increase confidence and assure donor families during and after the decision-making process on organ donation...|$|E

There are no established predictive factors to identify patients with a high probability of presenting BD. We set out to determine predictive factors of BD progression in patients with severe stroke and to build a prognostic score to help neurologists manage such patients. Method: We retrospectively collected clinical (sex, age, initial Glasgow score, initial arterial pressure, cardiovascular risk factors), and paraclinical (lesion volume, presence of herniation, hydrocephalus on brain imaging) data of consecutive severe stroke patients with a potential progression to BD through the hospital organ procurement and <b>transplant</b> <b>coordination</b> system in five centers in Lorrain (France) between 1 st January 2012 to 31 December 2013. Final endpoint was adjudicated BD. Statistical comparison of each factor was made between patients with and without BD. A prognostic score was made based on factors significantly associated with BD. Results: Of 400 included patients 91 (23 %) presented adjudicated BD. Initial Glasgow score ? 6 (p 65 mL (p= 0. 040), herniation (p= 0. 038), hydrocephalus (p 150 mmHg (p= 0. 034) and past history of alcohol abuse (p= 0. 002) were significantly associated with BD progression.

40|$|Brain-dead donors (BDD) are {{the single}} largest source of transplantable organs. Families’ {{informed}} consent to donate family members’ organs is always requested and is a determining factor {{in the success of}} organ transplantation. The interview between the transplant coordinator (TC) and the family of possible organ donors requires specific planning and methodology. The <b>transplant</b> <b>coordination</b> department at the Hospital Sant Creu and Sant Pau (HSCSP) of Barcelona (Spain) has developed a Family Interview Guide (FIG) for requesting informed consent to organ donation for transplantation from BDD. For the internal evaluation of the guidelines presented in this paper the AGREE II (Appraisal of Guidelines Research & Evaluation) instrument was used. We present our FIG to request organ donation and its assessment with the AGREE II instrument by four medical specialists. The FIG describes the process and content of the conversations surrounding the donation request. FIG was implemented in 2011 and consists of the following 13 sections: planning, recommendations, professionals conducting the interview, requestor’s attitude towards families, interview setting, timing of the interview, duration of the interview, requesting informed consent, details of the donation process to the donor’s family, formalizing the agreement, donor documentation, funeral arrangements administration procedures and psychological support for donor families. The main purpose of this guide is to increase organ donation rates. From January 2011 to August 2012, 40 consecutive family interviews from 40 BDD were conducted using FIG. For the evaluation of this FIG the AGREE II instrument was used. This is a generic tool designed primarily to assist designers and users of clinical guidelines in the assessment of their methodological quality. The rate of family consent to organ donation for transplantation in the HSCSP after implementation of this FIG in 40 consecutive family interviews was 100 %. The assessment of this clinical guideline with the AGREE II instrument scored 71 %.

40|$|Aim. To {{carry out}} {{monitoring}} of the organization and development of organ donation and transplantation in the Russian Federation according to 2014. Materials and methods. Questioning of heads of all the centers of transplantation is carried out. The comparative analysis of the obtained data in dynamics of years, between certain regions of the Russian Federation, the transplantation centers, and also with data of the international registers is made. Results. According to the Register in 2014 in the Russian Federation functioned 36 centers of kidney transplantation, 14 centers of liver transplantation and 9 centers of heart transplantation. The waiting list of kidney transplantation in 2014 included 4636 potential recipients that makes 16 % of total number of the patients 29 000 receiving dialysis. The rate of donor activity in 2014 made 3. 2 per million population (pmp). Efficiency of donor programs in 2014 continued to increase: the share of effective donors after brain death in 2014 increased to 77. 2 %, the share of multiorgan explantation made 50. 5 %, average number of organs received from one effective donor made 2. 6. In 2014 the rate of kidney transplantation made 7. 0 pmp, the rate of liver transplantation made 2. 1 pmp {{and the rate of}} heart transplantation made 1. 1 pmp.

40|$|The {{transplant}} surgery and <b>transplant</b> <b>coordination</b> department {{was created in}} 1997 {{to meet up with}} the demand of the growing abdominal {{transplant surgery}} and organ procurement activity at the University Hospitals in Leuven. Since then, the procurement activity has increased and is currently distributed within the University Hospital Gasthuisberg and a network of approximately 25 collaborative hospitals. The profile of the donors has changed with older donors and more co-morbidity factors (obesity, hypertension, etc.). This donor activity represents approximately 30 % of the national donor pool. Over the last 10 years, more than 1100 kidneys, more than 500 livers, approximately 50 pancreas, and 5 intestines have been transplanted in both adults and children. One year survival equal to- or exceeding 90 % has been achieved for all abdominal organs and this compares favorably with international registries. More than 40 multi-visceral transplants {liver in combination with abdominal (kidney, pancreas, intestine) or thoracic (heart, double lung, heart-lung) organs} have been performed with results equivalent to isolated liver transplants and very little immunological graft loss (probably due to the immunoprotective effect of the liver). A live donation program was started for the kidney (40 cases) and for the liver (10 cases) in adults and children and no surgical graft loss has been seen so far. Introduction of new machine perfusion systems (and development of donor protocols) has made it possible to restart a non-heart-beating donor program for kidney transplantation. Experimental demonstration that livers tolerate short periods of warm ischemia has also allowed to start liver transplantation from non-heart-beating donors. In the future, machine perfusion of livers, viability testing, and biological modulation are likely to widen the use of marginal livers for transplantation and improve the results. An immunomodulatory protocol proven in the lab to induce the development of regulatory T cells has been applied clinically to 5 consecutive intestinal transplants. All 5 [...] at the time of writing [...] have been rejection-free and have achieved nutritional independence. Continuous research and development is warranted to increase the organ donor pool (currently the solely limiting factor of transplantation) and to optimize long-term graft and patient outcome...|$|E
