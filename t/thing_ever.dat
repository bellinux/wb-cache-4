He described writing his story as if he was scoring a film, first making the cover art for the EP, and then coming up with the structures and sounds of the songs to fit it. He said in an interview with LA Weekly that [...] "Marrying music and pictures is the funnest <b>thing</b> <b>ever.</b> There's so many subconscious elements at play.

He performed his first professional gig at The Troubadour when he was twelve, but was so nervous he played {{with his back to the}} audience. Throughout his childhood, he had a wide range of musical influences, including The Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, The Who, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Nirvana, and, in high school, by Bob Marley, Bill Withers, Al Green, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and Michael Jackson. [...] He has also incorporated elements of The Police and Prince into his music. [...] In an interview with Billboard, he explained the diversity of his influences: [...] "I love every single kind of music ... even the most saccharine, sugary pop song can be the greatest <b>thing</b> <b>ever.</b> But so can a 25-minute crazy avant-garde fusion gnarly Herbie Hancock jam from the '70s".|$|E

500|$|The South Park {{football}} team plays a rival team from Middle Park, Colorado. Like South Park itself, Middle Park is an actual basin in the Rocky Mountains of north-central Colorado. Matt Stone said the Middle Park kids {{were made to}} seem richer and cooler than the South Park students {{because that was the}} perception real South Park residents have of the actual Middle Park. Richard Stamos, who sings during halftime in the episode's football game, is the fictional brother of John Stamos, a real-life actor best known for his roles on Full House and ER. Trey Parker and Matt Stone did not know Stamos when they wrote [...] "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride", but Parker said they assumed he was [...] "a big douche" [...] because of his role on Full House, which Parker called [...] "just the most horrible <b>thing</b> <b>ever</b> put on television". Since the episode aired, however, Parker and Stone have become acquainted with Stamos and found him to be [...] "a really, really cool guy". John Stamos told them he loved the inclusion of the Richard Stamos character in [...] "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride". Richard Stamos sings [...] "Lovin' You", a 1975 hit single by singer-songwriter Minnie Riperton. Parker chose it because he felt it was a popular song in the gay community, and also because, [...] "I've just always hated that song. I hate any song from that era, really.

That's fucking rubbish. Kids don't need to be hearing that nonsense." [...] While Gallagher has stated he did not intend [...] "Live Forever" [...] as a direct retort to Nirvana or their music (being a professed fan of the band), he contrasted the lives of Cobain and his band at that point, saying, [...] "Seems to me that here was a guy who had everything, and was miserable about it. And we had fuck-all, and I still thought that getting up in the morning was the greatest fuckin' <b>thing</b> <b>ever,</b> 'cause you didn't know where you'd end up at night. And we didn't have a pot to piss in, but it was fucking great, man". Gallagher considers the line [...] "We see things they'll never see" [...] the most important line of the song, explaining that old friends tend to laugh at jokes and stories that [...] "no one else gets".|$|E

500|$|With {{his wife}} {{administering}} the campaign organization, Sunday {{was free to}} do what he did best: compose and deliver colloquial sermons. Typically, Homer Rodeheaver would first warm up the crowd with congregational singing that alternated with numbers from gigantic choirs and music performed by the staff. When Sunday felt the moment right, he would launch into his message. Sunday gyrated, stood on the pulpit, ran from one end of the platform to the other, and dove across the stage, pretending to slide into home plate. Sometimes he even smashed chairs to emphasize his points. His sermon notes had to be printed in large letters so that he could catch a glimpse of them as he raced by the pulpit. In messages attacking sexual sin to groups of men only, Sunday could be graphic for the era. A theological opponent, Universalist minister Frederick William Betts, wrote, [...] "Many of the things said and done bordered upon things prohibited in decent society. The sermon on amusements was preached three times, to mixed audience of men and women, boys and girls. If the sermons to women had been preached to married women, if the sermons to men had been preached to mature men, if the sermon on amusements had been preached to grown folks, there might have been an excuse for them, and perhaps good from them. But an experienced newspaper reporter told me that the sermon on amusements was 'the rawest <b>thing</b> <b>ever</b> put over in Syracuse.' I can not, must not, quote from this sermon...", [...] "fainted under that awful definition;", [...] "if you do not 'hit the trail' then watch out for the fireworks"... says that Mr. Sunday's sermon on the sex question was raw and disgusting. He also heard the famous sermons on amusements and booze.

He saw people carried out who had fainted under that awful definition of sensuality and depravity.|$|E

Jersey had a distribution and [...] "first look" [...] deal with Columbia TriStar, which paid Tarantino for the right to consider exercising its option. In February, Pulp Fiction appeared on a Variety list of films in pre-production at TriStar. In June, however, the studio put the script into turnaround. According to a studio executive, TriStar chief Mike Medavoy found it [...] "too demented". There were suggestions that TriStar was resistant to back a film featuring a heroin user; there were also indications that the studio simply saw the project as too low-budget for its desired star-driven image. Avary— who was about to start shooting his own directorial debut, Killing Zoe— has said that TriStar's objections were comprehensive, encompassing the script's fundamental structure. He characterizes the studio's position: [...] "'This is the worst <b>thing</b> <b>ever</b> written. It makes no sense. Someone's dead and then they're alive.

[...] In October 2012, British singer Leona Lewis claimed that she was originally chosen to sing the song but ended up losing it to Rihanna when Harris went touring with the latter, commenting. [...] "I didn’t commit to it because I wanted [...] "Trouble" [...] to be my first single so I think that was another reason they went with Rihanna. It was the same version and production but mine’s better." [...] In 2013, Nicole Scherzinger claimed that she was the first artist given the song but ended up rejecting it, commenting.
