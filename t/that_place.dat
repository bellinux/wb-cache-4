5|$|Ale {{have several}} adversaries, {{including}} dragons, zmajeviti (dragon-like) men, eagles, St. Elijah, and St. Sava. The principal {{enemy of the}} ala is the dragon; {{he is able to}} defeat her and eliminate her harmful effects. Dragons are thus seen as guardians of the fields and harvest, and as protectors against bad weather. When an ala threatens by bringing hail clouds, a dragon comes out to fight with her and drive her away. His main weapon is lightning; thunder represents a fight between ale and dragons (during which ale hide in tall trees). An instance of a more abundant crop at a particular point is explained in the Pčinja region {{as a result of a}} dragon having struck an ala with lightning just over <b>that</b> <b>place,</b> making her drop the looted grains she had been carrying in her huge ears. If an ala finds a dragon in a hollow tree, however, she can destroy him by burning the tree.|$|E

5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, tengu {{came to be}} feared as the {{vigilant}} protectors {{of certain}} forests. In the 1764 collection of strange stories , a tale tells {{of a man who}} wanders into a deep valley while gathering leaves, only to be faced with a sudden and ferocious hailstorm. A group of peasants later tell him {{that he was in the}} valley where the guhin live, and anyone who takes a single leaf from <b>that</b> <b>place</b> will surely die. In the , written in 1849, the author describes the customs of the wood-cutters of Mino Province, who used a sort of rice cake called kuhin-mochi to placate the tengu, who would otherwise perpetrate all sorts of mischief. In other provinces a special kind of fish called okoze was offered to the tengu by woodsmen and hunters, in exchange for a successful day's work. The people of Ishikawa Prefecture have until recently believed that the tengu loathe mackerel, and have used this fish as a charm against kidnappings and hauntings by the mischievous spirits.|$|E
5|$|In {{the western}} fringe of Macedonia, {{which is now}} part of Albania, Jovan Vladimir was remembered as a saintly ruler, cut down by his father-in-law, an emperor, who {{believed}} some slander that he was a womanizer. The enraged emperor, accompanied by soldiers, found Vladimir on a mountain pass named Qafë Thanë (also known as Derven), on the road between the Macedonian town of Struga and Elbasan. He struck his son-in-law with a sword, but could not cut him. Only when Vladimir gave him his own sword was the emperor able to cut off his head. Vladimir took his severed head and went toward the site of his future church. There stood an oak, under which he fell after the tree bowed down before him. The saint was interred in the church which was subsequently built at <b>that</b> <b>place</b> and dedicated to him.|$|E
5|$|Jane Elizabeth Manning James {{was born}} in Wilton, Connecticut, to Isaac and Eliza Manning. Although, late in James' life her brother Isaac gave her {{birthday}} as 1813, there are source discrepancies <b>that</b> <b>place</b> her birthday anywhere from September 22, 1812, to the year 1820. The Mannings were a free family living in rural Connecticut, and James had at least five siblings including Isaac, Lewis, Peter, Sarah, and Angeline. At the age of six, James was sent away {{to live with the}} Fitches, a wealthy Caucasian family. She was raised by the Fitches' daughter and lived with them for the next thirty years. Little is known about James' life with the Fitches other than she worked as a servant: cooking, cleaning, and ironing, etc. While with the Fitches, James was also brought up as a Christian. She was baptized into the Presbyterian Church when she was about 14 years old. On March 1, 1835, James gave birth to a son, Sylvester.|$|E

5|$|Most of what {{is known}} about John Endecott's origins is the result of {{research}} conducted since the 1990s. Biographers of the 19th century believed he was from the Dorset town of Dorchester because of his significant later association with people from <b>that</b> <b>place.</b> In the early 20th century, historian Roper Lethbridge proposed that Endecott was born circa 1588 in or near Chagford in Devon. Interestingly, in the 16th century the prominent Endecott family, together with the Whiddons, Knapmans and Lethbridges, owned most of the mines around the stannary town of Chagford, which might—if he is indeed from this family—explain the Governor's interest in developing copper mining. (Based on this evidence, Chagford now has a house from the period named in Endecott's honour.) However, more recent research by the New England Historic Genealogical Society has identified problems with Lethbridge's claims, which they dispute. Endecott has more recently been definitively determined to have been born in 1588 in Chagford, to Thomas Endecott and an unnamed mother, who died shortly after his birth.|$|E
5|$|One {{property}} {{unique to}} Archaea is the abundant use of ether-linked lipids in their cell membranes. Ether linkages are more chemically stable than the ester linkages found in Bacteria and Eukarya, {{which may be}} a contributing factor {{to the ability of}} many Archaea to survive in extreme environments <b>that</b> <b>place</b> heavy stress on cell membranes, such as extreme heat and salinity. Comparative analysis of archaeal genomes has also identified several molecular signatures in the form of conserved signature indels and signature proteins which are uniquely present in either all Archaea or different main groups within Archaea. Another unique feature of Archaea is that no other known organisms are capable of methanogenesis (the metabolic production of methane). Methanogenic Archaea play a pivotal role in ecosystems with organisms that derive energy from oxidation of methane, many of which are Bacteria, as they are often a major source of methane in such environments and can play a role as primary producers. Methanogens also {{play a critical role in}} the carbon cycle, breaking down organic carbon into methane, which is also a major greenhouse gas.|$|E

There are papers that are very successful, such as the UK-based The Big Issue, which in 2001 sold nearly 300,000 copies a week and earned the equivalent of 1 millionUSD in profits, but many papers sell as few as 3,000 copies a month and barely generate a profit at all for the publishers.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Romani has, however, been {{surrounded}} with controversy and criticism.

That the Ottoman Empire's intention was to strongly occupy Romani and Kantara is supported by preparations in the southern territory of Palestine adjacent to, and extending into, the Sinai. These included extending the Palestine railway system to Wadi El Arish, with a good motor road beside the railway. Cisterns and other works were constructed along this route to store water and at Wadi El Arish, enormous rock cut reservoirs were under construction in December 1916 when the Anzac Mounted Division reached <b>that</b> <b>place</b> just before the Battle of Magdhaba.|$|E
