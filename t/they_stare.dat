2500|$|The game's AI {{was often}} cited as another {{weakness}} of the game, with IGN listing glitches such as an enemy boss walking off a cliff and [...] "saving us the bother of having to defeat him in combat". Eurogamer stated that the player's allies were [...] "AI-impoverished", stepping into the player's line of fire [...] "before sauntering off unscathed and oblivious", while Game Informer said that the AI appears to be [...] "tripping on acid as <b>they</b> <b>stare</b> blankly at walls and sunsets". The lack of mid-level saves or a checkpoint system was also quoted as a weakness, forcing the player to restart a level {{if they fail to}} complete an objective.|$|E
60|$|He stops. <b>They</b> <b>stare</b> at him dumbfounded, {{and leave}} it to the priest to answer him.|$|E
6000|$|Slowly, slowly, {{thick as}} pap, [...] The {{creeping}} yellow waters rise; [...] Like drowning mice within a trap, [...] <b>They</b> <b>stare</b> around with frantic eyes.|$|E
60|$|Still <b>they</b> <b>stared.</b> At length {{the elder}} woman opened her lips.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>stared</b> at her rather suspiciously, not yet {{understanding}} her idea.|$|R
50|$|<b>They</b> shook, <b>they</b> <b>stared</b> as white's their shirt::Them it {{was their}} poison hurt.|$|R
6000|$|Anto. Oh horrid sight! how <b>they</b> <b>stare</b> upon us! [...] The fiend will hurry us to {{the dark}} mansion. [...] Sweet heaven, have mercy on us! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But if <b>they</b> <b>stare</b> {{straight}} {{the other}} way?" [...] Mrs. Medwin continued to object. [...] "You can't simply {{go up to}} them and twist their heads about." ...|$|E
60|$|Bentley comes back, {{with his}} {{shoulders}} hanging {{as if he}} too had been exercised to the last pitch of fatigue. He is very sad. <b>They</b> <b>stare</b> {{at him as he}} gropes to Percival's chair.|$|E
60|$|Denton {{stood up}} sharply. <b>They</b> <b>stared</b> {{at one another}} through a long silence.|$|R
60|$|For a {{long time}} <b>they</b> <b>stared</b> at the picture. At last Dorle {{replaced}} the board.|$|R
60|$|For {{the moment}} <b>they</b> <b>stared</b> at the speaker {{as if they}} had not heard aright.|$|R
6000|$|He rises; {{she rises}} too. [...] "Where," [...] she asks him, darkening her large eyes until their {{drooping}} lids almost conceal them--and yet <b>they</b> <b>stare,</b> [...] "where is your false, your treacherous, and cursed wife?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sorry, Jeekie," [...] said Alan with {{a little}} laugh, [...] "but I can't eat off living tables, {{especially}} when <b>they</b> <b>stare</b> at one like that. You tell them that to-morrow we will breakfast alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, dear! But I can't {{go about}} alone. I hate these men, <b>they</b> <b>stare</b> at me so! I wish I was a man. It's awful to be a woman, don't you think so? Please don't laugh." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>stared</b> at {{each other}} through a pause, and both faces were flushed and obstinate.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>stared</b> at {{one another}} again. They took things for granted in the most amazing way.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>they</b> all <b>stared</b> at me, {{and then}} <b>they</b> all <b>stared</b> at the ship lying at anchor.|$|R
6000|$|... (Miss Bailey {{goes down}} off the scales. Her eyes are full of [...] despondency {{although}} she tries to make a brave face of it, [...] forcing a laugh as she joins the women. <b>They</b> <b>stare</b> at her with [...] pitying looks and murmur consoling phrases.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} is you <b>they</b> <b>stare</b> at and envy," [...] said Margaret, glancing at the splendid woman at her side, whose beauty she knew well over-shadowed her own rarer loveliness, at any rate in a street pageant, as in the {{sunshine}} the rose overshadows the lily.|$|E
60|$|And now <b>they</b> <b>stare</b> {{around them}} with eager, greedy eyes, {{awaiting}} the amusement of the spectacle; {{gazing at the}} President, with his tall Phrygian cap; at the clerks wielding their indefatigable quill pens, writing, writing, writing; at the flickering lights, throwing clouds of sooty smoke, up to the dark ceiling above.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>stared</b> at him, {{these two}} white-faced brothers, like tiger-cats about to spring. Mr. von Tassen was getting impatient.|$|R
60|$|And yet, and yet <b>they</b> <b>stared,</b> for she {{had spoken}} with a strange {{certainty}} like one who knew the god, and was she not named Star of Amen, and were there not wondrous tales as to her birth, and had not a lotus-bloom seemed to turn to gold and jewels in the hand of this young, anointed Queen who bore the Cross of Life upon her breast? No, nothing would happen, but still <b>they</b> <b>stared.</b>|$|R
60|$|But we {{were all}} of us quite silent now. The {{children}} did not even cry; <b>they</b> <b>stared,</b> wide-eyed, paralysed with fear.|$|R
6000|$|No Chemistry {{for them}} unfolds her gases, [...] No Metaphysics are let loose in lectures, [...] No Circulating Library amasses [...] Religious novels, moral tales, and strictures [...] Upon the living manners, {{as they pass}} us; [...] No Exhibition glares with annual pictures; [...] <b>They</b> <b>stare</b> not on the stars from out their attics, [...] Nor deal (thank God for that!) in Mathematics.[231] ...|$|E
6000|$|Zerah. [...] Above [...] He dwells with angels, {{and they}} love. [...] Can these love? With the living's pride [...] <b>They</b> <b>stare</b> {{at those who}} die, who hang [...] In their sight and die. They bear the streak [...] Of the crosses' shadow, black not wide, [...] To fall on their heads, as it swerves aside [...] When the victims' pang [...] Makes the dry wood creak.|$|E
6000|$|Capt. H. It's as if I were to {{have two}} {{children}} to-morrow. My son Harry--and the only sensible girl--------. Why, my dear, I couldn't get on without you. We two are reasonable together. The {{rest of the people}} in this town are crazy. The way <b>they</b> <b>stare</b> at you. And the grins--they're all on the grin. It makes me dislike to go out. (Bewildered.) It seems as if there was something wrong about--somewhere. My dear, is there anything wrong--you who are sensible.. [...] .|$|E
60|$|For {{the space}} of perhaps two seconds <b>they</b> <b>stared</b> at each other, eye to eye. Then she {{vanished}} into the room.|$|R
60|$|Then, dimly {{conscious}} that their last words had revealed {{the difference of}} their temperaments and creeds, <b>they</b> <b>stared</b> at one another.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>stared</b> at {{one another}} {{for a moment and}} then she looked away. She kept her eyes averted when she spoke.|$|R
6000|$|She {{looked a}} little frightened again, and then said hurriedly: [...] "I only thought that I would meet you on Montgomery Street, and we would walk home together. I don't {{like to go out}} alone, and mother cannot always go with me. Tappington never cared to take me out--I don't know why. I think he didn't like the people staring and stop ping us. But <b>they</b> <b>stare</b> more--don't you think?--when one is alone. So I thought if you were coming {{straight}} home we might come together--unless you have something else to do?" ...|$|E
60|$|Someone {{has told}} them--I think I first started {{the idea in}} my pamphlet--that the thing is to sleep {{on a pile of}} hemlock branches. I think I told them to listen to the wind sowing (you know the word I mean), sowing and crooning in the giant pines. So there they are upside-down, doubled up on a couch of green spikes that would have killed St. Sebastian. <b>They</b> <b>stare</b> up at the sky with blood-shot, restless eyes, waiting for the crooning to begin. And there isn't a sow in sight.|$|E
60|$|In {{remembrance of}} our visit, a little brown child, some {{three or four}} years old, who had been christened that day, was named after me; and I was glad to have my name connected, even in so minute an item, with an {{institution}} which at all events delivers children from the fancy that they can, without being good or doing good, conciliate the upper powers by hanging garlands on a trident inside a hut, or putting red dust on a stump of wood outside it, while <b>they</b> <b>stare</b> in and mumble prayers to they know not what of gilded wood.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>stared</b> at the hoofprints in the road, {{but there}} were too many of them to make {{anything}} of the marks.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>stared</b> {{at her in}} amazement. Only Granet, with an effort, {{kept his}} face expressionless. Sir Meyville began to mutter to himself.|$|R
60|$|A wave {{of panic}} {{passed over the}} vessel, and these rough and hardy men who feared no mortal foe shook with terror at the shadows of their own minds. <b>They</b> <b>stared</b> into the cloud with blanched faces and fixed eyes, as though each instant some fearsome shape might break in upon them. And as <b>they</b> <b>stared</b> there came a gust of wind. For a moment the fog-bank rose and a circle of ocean lay before them.|$|R
