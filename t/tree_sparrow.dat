5|$|The Eurasian <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> (Passer montanus) is a {{passerine}} {{bird in the}} sparrow {{family with}} a rich chestnut crown and nape, and a black patch on each pure white cheek. The sexes are similarly plumaged, and young birds are a duller version of the adult. This sparrow breeds over most of temperate Eurasia and Southeast Asia, where it {{is known as the}} <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow,</b> and it has been introduced elsewhere including the United States, where it is known as the Eurasian <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> or German sparrow to differentiate it from the native unrelated American <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow.</b> Although several subspecies are recognised, the appearance of this bird varies little across its extensive range.|$|E
5|$|When the Eurasian <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> and {{the larger}} house sparrow occur in the same area, the house sparrow {{generally}} breeds in urban areas while the smaller Eurasian <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> nests in the countryside. Where trees are in short supply, as in Mongolia, both species may utilise man-made structures as nest sites. The Eurasian <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> is rural in Europe, but is an urban bird in eastern Asia; in southern and central Asia, both Passer species may be found around towns and villages. In parts of the Mediterranean, such as Italy, both the tree and the Italian or Spanish sparrows {{may be found in}} settlements. In Australia, the Eurasian <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> is largely an urban bird, and it is the house sparrow which utilises more natural habitats.|$|E
5|$|Hybridisation {{between the}} Eurasian <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> {{and the house}} sparrow has been {{recorded}} {{in many parts of}} the world with male hybrids tending to resemble the Eurasian <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> while females have more similarities with the house sparrow. A breeding population in the Eastern Ghats of India, said to be introduced, may also hybridise with house sparrows. On at least one occasion a mixed pair has resulted in fertile young. A wild hybridisation with the resident sparrows of Malta, which are intermediate between the Spanish sparrow (P. hispaniolensis) and Italian sparrows (P. italiae), was recorded in Malta in 1975.|$|E
40|$|<b>Tree</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Passer montanus) {{are widely}} {{distributed}} in all seasons in many countries. In this study, a survey and relevant experiments on avian influenza (AI) in <b>tree</b> <b>sparrows</b> were conducted. The results {{suggested that the}} receptor for avian influenza viruses (AIVs), SA 12, 3 Gal, is abundant in the respiratory tract of <b>tree</b> <b>sparrows,</b> {{and most of the}} <b>tree</b> <b>sparrows</b> infected experimentally with two H 5 subtype highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses died within five days after inoculation. Furthermore, no AIVs were isolated from the rectum eluate of 1300 <b>tree</b> <b>sparrows,</b> but 94 serological positives of AI were found in 800 <b>tree</b> <b>sparrows.</b> The serological positives were more prevalent for H 5 subtype HPAI (94 / 800) than for H 7 subtype AI (0 / 800), more prevalent for clade 2. 3. 2. 1 H 5 subtype HPAI (89 / 800) than for clade 2. 3. 4 (1 / 800) and clade 7. 2 (4 / 800) H 5 subtype HPAI, more prevalent for clade 2. 3. 2. 1 H 5 subtype HPAI in a city in southern China (82 / 800) than in a city in northern China (8 / 800). The serological data are all consistent with the distribution of the subtypes or clades of AI in poultry in China. Previously, sparrows or other passerine birds were often found to be pathogenically negative for AIVs, except when an AIV was circulating in the local poultry, or the tested passerine birds were from a region near waterfowl-rich bodies of water. Taken together, the data suggest that <b>tree</b> <b>sparrows</b> are susceptible to infection of AIVs, and surveys targeting sparrows can provide good serological data about the circulation of AIVs in relevant regions...|$|R

5|$|In Australia, the Eurasian <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> {{is present}} in Melbourne, towns in central and {{northern}} Victoria and some centres in the Riverina region of New South Wales. It is a prohibited species in Western Australia, where it often arrives on ships from Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|The iris is {{chestnut}} in colour. The legs of {{both sexes}} are pale brown to pinkish-brown. The flight of all sparrows is swift, {{and that of the}} russet sparrow is described as swifter and more direct than that of the Eurasian <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> {{is seen as}} a pest in some areas. In Australia, it damages many {{cereal and}} fruit crops and spoils cereal crops, animal feed and stored grain with its droppings. Quarantine rules {{prohibit}} the transport of this species into Western Australia.|$|E

40|$|The {{abundance}} and habitat associations of overwintering birds in Platte River Valley of central Nebraska may influence their long-term survival. I observed {{a total of}} 51 species {{over a three-year period}} in shrub-grassland, forest, grassland, and cropland habitats during the winter. Grassland habitats had the lowest abundance of wintering birds, while abundances in shrub-grassland, forest, and cropland habitats were higher and similar. Species richness was highest in forests (x= 2. 97 species) and lowest in grasslands (x = 0. 73 species) and croplands (x = 0. 57 species). Overall, horned larks (Eremophila alpestris), American <b>tree</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Spizella arborea), black-capped chickadees (Parus atricapillus), dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis), western meadowlarks (Sturnella neglects), and red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) were the most abundant wintering birds in the Platte River Valley. American <b>tree</b> <b>sparrows</b> (34 %) accounted for most of the birds in shrub-grasslands, while black-capped chickadees (18 %), dark-eyed juncos (11 %), and American <b>tree</b> <b>sparrows</b> (10 %) accounted for most of the birds in forests. Grasslands were dominated by American <b>tree</b> <b>sparrows</b> (39 %) and western meadowlarks (27 %), and croplands were dominated by horned larks (43 %), red-winged blackbirds (25 %), and western meadowlarks (16 %). The winter bird community in the Platte River Valley is dominated by woodland-associated species. Many of the woodland-associated species that overwinter in the Platte River Valley have likely benefited from the development of woodlands in the region...|$|R
500|$|Chairman Mao Zedong of China {{attempted}} in April 1958 {{to reduce}} crop damage by <b>tree</b> <b>sparrows,</b> estimated at [...] of grain per bird each year, by mobilising {{three million people}} and many scarecrows to drive the birds to death by exhaustion. Although initially successful, the [...] "great sparrow campaign" [...] had overlooked the numbers of locusts and other insect pests consumed by the birds, and crop yields fell, exacerbating a famine {{which led to the}} deaths of 30million people between 1959 and 1961. The <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow's</b> consumption of insects has led to its use in agriculture to control fruit tree pests and the common asparagus beetle, Crioceris aspergi.|$|R
5|$|In {{parts of}} the range, the russet sparrow inhabits towns, and in most of its range, it occurs near cultivation, and is a minor pest of agriculture. Though it damages crops, it also feeds its nestlings largely on insect pests. In China, the russet sparrow has been {{recorded}} as a captive bird, kept with the Eurasian <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow.</b> In Japan it was eaten in the 1870s and sold in the Yokohama game market. The russet sparrow is known well enough in the Himalayas that in most languages it has a different vernacular name from the Eurasian <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow.</b> Examples of these vernacular names include lal gouriya in Hindi and kang-che-go-ma in Tibetan. The Japanese artist Hokusai portrayed the russet sparrow, and due to this, it has appeared on postage stamps featuring Japanese art in Japan, The Gambia, and Guyana.|$|E
5|$|The immune {{response}} of tree sparrows is less robust {{than that of}} the house sparrow and has been proposed as a factor in the greater invasive potential of the latter. The house sparrow and <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> are the most frequent victims of roadkill on the roads of Central, Eastern and Southern Europe. The maximum recorded age is 13.1 years, but three years is a typical lifespan.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> {{has been}} {{expanding}} its range in Fennoscandia and eastern Europe, populations have been declining {{in much of}} western Europe, a trend reflected in other farmland birds such as the skylark, corn bunting and northern lapwing. From 1980 to 2003, common farmland bird numbers fell by 28%. The collapse in populations {{seems to have been}} particularly severe in Great Britain, where there was a 95% decline between 1970 and 1998, and Ireland, which had only 1,000â€“1,500 pairs in the late 1990s. In the British Isles, such declines may be due to natural fluctuations, to which tree sparrows are known to be prone. Breeding performance has improved substantially as population sizes have decreased, suggesting that decreases in productivity were not responsible for the decline and that survival was the critical factor. The large decline in <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> numbers is probably the result of agricultural intensification and specialisation, particularly the increased use of herbicides and a trend towards autumn-sown crops (at the expense of spring-sown crops that produce stubble fields in winter). The change from mixed to specialised farming and the increased use of insecticides has reduced the amount of insect food available for nestlings.|$|E

5|$|Predators of the <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> {{include a}} variety of accipiters, falcons and owls, such as the Eurasian sparrowhawk, common kestrel, little owl, and {{sometimes}} long-eared owl and white stork. It {{does not appear to}} be at an increased risk of predation during its autumn moult, despite having fewer flight feathers at that time. Nests may be raided by Eurasian magpies, jays, least weasels, rats, cats and constricting snakes such as the horseshoe whip snake.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> {{has been}} {{introduced}} outside its native range, but has not always become established, possibly due to competition with the house sparrow. It was introduced successfully to Sardinia, eastern Indonesia, the Philippines and Micronesia, but introductions to New Zealand and Bermuda did not take root. Ship-carried birds colonised Borneo. This sparrow has occurred as a natural vagrant to Gibraltar, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Israel, and Dubai.|$|E
5|$|The russet sparrow's {{breeding}} season is short, lasting about three months. The Himalayan subspecies cinnamomeus {{has been recorded}} breeding from April to August, the nominate subspecies breeds from May to July, and the subspecies intensior is believed to breed in March. During its {{breeding season}}, the russet sparrow is not gregarious, and its nests are dispersed uniformly rather than clustered. Its nests are most frequently built in tree cavities, often disused woodpecker nests. The russet sparrow has been recorded breeding alongside the Eurasian <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> and white wagtail in black kite nests, {{taking advantage of the}} territorial defence of the kites to avoid nest predation. Other nest locations include the eaves of thatched roofs, stone walls and embankments, and electric junction boxes. In Bhutan, it nests in holes in the outer walls of monasteries, often alongside the Eurasian <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow.</b> In Sakhalin, it will sometimes build free-standing nests in bushes. The russet sparrow also uses the disused nests of the red-rumped swallow, and a pair of russet sparrows has been recorded attempting to oust a pair of black-crested tits from their nest.|$|E

Nevertheless, wing length alone was equally good predictor of the sex. Other measured traits had only moderate discriminant value.

5|$|The <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> has a large, {{currently}} unquantified range; {{its world}} population is also unknown, but includes an estimated 52â€“96 million individuals in Europe. Although population trends {{have not been}} evaluated, the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (that is, declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations).

5|$|The <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> is a {{predominantly}} seed and grain eating bird which feeds {{on the ground}} in flocks, often with house sparrows, finches, or buntings. It eats weed seeds, such as chickweeds and goosefoot, spilled grain, and it may also visit feeding stations, especially for peanuts. It will also feed on invertebrates, especially during the breeding season when the young are fed mainly on animal food; it takes insects, woodlice, millipedes, centipedes, spiders and harvestmen.|$|E

40|$|Photorefractoriness, a {{reversible}} {{state of}} unresponsiveness to daylengths f gonadoswnulatory duration, terminates seasonal breeding in many pholoperiodic species of birds. Whether {{the eyes are}} components of the mechanism that triggers photorefractoriness is an important, but heretofore unresolved, question. Although a role for extraocular photoreception in the mechanism of photoinduced gonadal growth is well documented, the eyes may be important in the mechanism of phozorefractoriness if, as some evidence suggests, they are gonadoinhibitory. With American <b>tree</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Spizella arborea), I here confirm {{that the absence of}} eyes does not impede photoinduced testicular growth and establish that an extraocular mechanism mediates the transition from photosensitivity to photorefractoriness: <b>Tree</b> <b>sparrows</b> blinded by bilateral ocular enucleation, when photostimulated by long days or by miniature self-powered lights implanted atop the skull, showed marked testicular growth and then, as evidenced by spontaneous testicular regression, became photorefrac-tory, as did sighted controls...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} was performed to clarify whether photorefractoriness in male <b>tree</b> <b>sparrows</b> is maintained by an androgen-dependent mechanism. Castration did not raise plasma LH in photorefractory males held under a daily photoperiod of 20 h light: 4 h darkness (20 L: 4 D). Castrated photorefractory males were implanted with the antiandrogen cyproterone or injected s. c. with the antiandrogen flutamide to deter-mine whether androgens which may be resistant to castration inhibit LH secretion. Neither cyproterone nor flutamide raised plasma LH above values found in castrated control birds. Castrated photorefractory males were treated with testosterone to determine whether plasma LH in photorefractory males is androgen-suppressible. Concentrations of plasma LH were independent of plasma testosterone {{over a wide range}} of concentrations. The lack of LH response to castration, to castration coupled with antiandrogen therapy, and to castration coupled with testosterone replacement argues that photorefractoriness in male <b>tree</b> <b>sparrows</b> is maintained by an androgen=req- independent mechanism.

5|$|The Eurasian <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> has no true song, but its vocalisations {{include an}} excited series of tschip calls given by {{unpaired}} or courting males. Other monosyllabic chirps {{are used in}} social contacts, and the flight call is a harsh teck. A study comparing the vocalisations of the introduced Missouri population with those of birds from Germany showed that the US birds had fewer shared syllable types (memes) and more structure within the population than the European sparrows. This may have resulted from {{the small size of}} the founding North American population and a consequent loss of genetic diversity.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> is {{widespread}} in the towns and cities of eastern Asia, but in Europe it is a bird of lightly wooded open countryside, with the house sparrow breeding in the more urban areas. The Eurasian tree sparrow's extensive range and large population ensure {{that it is not}} endangered globally, but there have been large declines in western European populations, in part due to changes in farming practices involving increased use of herbicides and loss of winter stubble fields. In eastern Asia and western Australia, this species is sometimes viewed as a pest, although it is also widely celebrated in oriental art.|$|E
