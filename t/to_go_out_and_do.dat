2500|$|The {{lyrics are}} said to be {{intended}} to poke fun at University President Colonel Prather. Prather had attended Washington College, now Washington and Lee University, whose president, Robert E. Lee, would frequently tell his students, [...] "the eyes of the South are upon you." [...] Prather was known for including in his speeches a similar admonition, [...] "The Eyes of Texas are Upon You," [...] meaning that the state of Texas was watching and expecting the students <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> great things. Prather enjoyed the song and promoted its usage. He died not long thereafter, and the song was played at his funeral.|$|E
2500|$|Harris {{currently}} teaches and directs. Asked if {{she might}} one day be lured back to mainstream stage, film or television, Harris said in the 2002 interview: Well, if someone handed me something fantastic for 10 million dollars, I'd work again. But I haven't worked {{in a long time}} as an actor. I don't miss it. I think the only thing that drew me to acting in the first place was the group of people I was working with: Ed Asner, Paul Sills, Mike Nichols, Elaine May. And all I really wanted to do back then was rehearsal. I was in it for the process, and I really resented having <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> a performance for an audience, because the process stopped; it had to freeze and be the same every night. It wasn't as interesting." ...|$|E

60|$|In the {{old days}} the Consul used, {{as a matter of}} course, <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> the fighting. When there was an enemy here, or an enemy there, the Consul was bound to hurry off with his army, north or south, to {{different}} parts of Italy. But gradually this system became impracticable. Distances became too great, as the Empire extended itself beyond the bounds of Italy, to admit of the absence of the Consuls. Wars prolonged themselves through many campaigns, as notably did that which was soon to take place in Gaul under Cæsar. The Consuls remained at home, and Generals were sent out with proconsular authority. This had become so certainly the case, that Cicero on becoming Consul had no fear of being called on to fight the enemies of his country. There was much fighting then in course of being done by Pompey in the East; but this would give but little trouble to the great officers at home, unless it might be in sending out necessary supplies.|$|E

Yet I don't feel as you do about the {{selfishness}} of enjoying a good breakfast in comfortable circumstances, for it is God who has given us all that we have, as well as the power to enjoy it. I grant, that if we simply enjoyed our good things, and neither thought of nor cared for the poor, we should indeed be most abominably selfish, but happily that is not our case this morning. Have we not risen an hour earlier than usual <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> what we can to mitigate the sorrows of the poor? Are we not about to face the bitter blast and the driving snow on this Christmas morning for that very purpose? and should we not be rendered much less capable of doing so, if we were to start off on our mission with cold bodies and half-filled--I beg pardon, pass the muffins, dear. Besides, sister mine, if you were to go out on such a morning cold and underfed, would it not be probable that I should have to go and fetch a doctor for you instead of taking you out to help me in aiding and comforting poor people?" ...|$|E
