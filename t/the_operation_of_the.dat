5|$|The 1215 charter {{had several}} clauses {{relating}} to the royal forests; clauses 47 and 48 promised to deforest the lands added to the forests under John and investigate the use of royal rights in this area, but notably {{did not address the}} forestation of the previous kings, while clause 53 promised some form of redress for those affected by the recent changes, and clause 44 promised some relief from <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forest courts.

5|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, {{the company had}} sold all its hotel operations. The merged company {{retained}} the obligation to operate dining services on the trains, which throughout the 1980s necessitated considerable subsidies from NSB. In 1988, NSB decided to organize <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dining services through tendered contracts; the first contract (from 1990 through 1995) was won by TogService, a Narvesen subsidiary.

In 1995 NSB sold its shares with Fritt Ord's approval, and the company was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.|$|E

During the 44-month time frame, 454 naval aviators were killed, captured, or missing during combined operations over North Vietnam and Laos.|$|E

5|$|During {{the coming}} decades, however, the {{suitability}} of the tower {{for the work of}} the department came into question. The condition of the roof remained problematic, and steel girders had to be added to support the main timbers. Increasing traffic levels around the tower led to subsidence and high levels of vibration, effecting <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> delicate instruments, and worsened after the opening of Lambeth Bridge in 1932. Some of the department's work was transferred to their Bushy House facility in Teddington in the 1920s, and in 1938 the department relinquished the tower altogether.|$|E

With Clement's support, Edward attempted to gain the financial support of the English Church for his military campaigns in Scotland, including taxation and borrowing money against the funds gathered for the crusades. The English Church did relatively little to influence or moderate Edward's behaviour during his reign, possibly because of the bishops' self-interest and concern for their own protection.|$|E
