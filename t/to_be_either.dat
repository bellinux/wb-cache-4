5|$|Some of the {{material}} in the pamphlet appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>either</b> a straight reprint or plagiarism of older material, including from a 1734 text, Pretty Doings in a Protestant Nation, by the pseudonymous Father Poussin. Part of the same section also seems to have appeared in William Walsh's 1691 A Dialogue Concerning Women. Another reused source is a c.1731 (1720 in some sources) pamphlet, Plain Reasons for the Growth of Sodomy in England.|$|E
5|$|This {{debate is}} still ongoing; at this time, Scelidosaurus is {{considered}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>either</b> {{more closely related}} to ankylosaurids than to stegosaurids and, by extension, a true ankylosaur, or basal to the ankylosaur-stegosaur split. The stegosaur classification has fallen out of favor, but is seen in older dinosaur books. Cladistic analyses have invariably recovered a basal position for Scelidosaurus, outside of the Eurypoda.|$|E

Proposed causes for this include genetics and environmental factors such as being triggered by a viral infection. MS is usually diagnosed based on the presenting signs and symptoms and the results of supporting medical tests.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the initial}} description, the eye socket of Euchambersia is rather small. The {{branches}} of the postorbital and jugal that usually surround the back {{and bottom of the}} eye socket in therocephalians appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>either</b> very reduced or absent entirely. Meanwhile, the top of the eye socket is formed by the prefrontal, and the frontal is also small. The skull does not bear a pineal foramen. Like Whaitsia, the pterygoid and palatine of the palate are not separated from the transpalatine, further {{to the side of the}} jaw, by any sort of opening.|$|E
5|$|Away colours {{have tended}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>either</b> white—often with black shorts—or a {{combination}} of yellow and black, referring back to the black and gold strips of the pre-war era, although {{for a time in}} the 1970s, Aberdeen sported an all-blue change strip with white socks. For the 2007–08 season, the change strip was all-white, with a third kit of yellow and black halves available if needed for European games, or {{in the event of a}} clash involving both red and white.|$|E

5|$|Caxias {{was growing}} old, and was ill and {{exhausted}} {{by the time he}} reached Asunción. As he did not feel up to the task of pursuing López into the Paraguayan hinterland, he asked <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>either</b> relieved of his post or given a short leave. Although his request was denied, he appointed a senior member of his staff as acting commander, and left for Brazil on 19 January 1869. The Emperor was angered that the marquis had left his post without permission, and especially that Caxias had declared the war to have been already won—even though López was still at large and regrouping his few remaining military assets. Caxias' ill-conceived decision seriously endangered the hard-won achievements of the past months, even as the objective of eliminating López as a threat remained tantalizingly within reach.|$|E
5|$|Ida is {{classified}} as an S-type asteroid based on ground-based spectroscopic measurements. The composition of S-types was uncertain before the Galileo flybys, but was interpreted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>either</b> of two minerals found in meteorites that had fallen to the Earth: ordinary chondrite (OC) and stony-iron. Estimates of Ida's density are constrained to less than 3.2g/cm3 by the long-term stability of Dactyl's orbit. This all but rules out a stony-iron composition; were Ida made of 5g/cm3 iron- and nickel-rich material, {{it would have to}} contain more than 40% empty space.|$|E
5|$|In Montana, {{municipalities}} {{are divided}} into four classes by state statute based on their population. Members of the three largest classes are deemed cities, while {{the members of the}} fourth class are called towns. Cities and towns are classified {{at the time of their}} organization, and are reorganized when they change classification due to an increase or decrease in population. A place may incorporate as a town with the support of 300 electors or two-thirds of the registered electors. A municipality with a population between 1,000 and 5,000 people is a Third Class city. A municipality with a population between 5,000 and 10,000 people is a Second Class city. And a municipality with a population over 10,000 people is a First Class city. Under certain exceptions municipalities with a population of between 9,000 and 10,000 may elect by resolution <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>either</b> a First or Second Class city. Under similar exceptions municipalities with a population of between 5,000 and 7,500 may elect by resolution <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>either</b> a Second or Third Class city. Municipalities with a population of between 1,000 and 2,500 may by resolution be classified as either a town or Third Class city. Unincorporated places such as census-designated places fall outside this scheme, and are subject to county governance, and thus are not towns or cities.|$|E

5|$|In {{the board}} (and card) game domain, 4X {{is less of}} a {{distinct}} genre, {{in part because of the}} practical constraints of components and playing time. The Civilization board game that gave rise to Sid Meier's Civilization computer game, for instance, has no exploration and no extermination. Unless extermination is targeted at non-player entities, it tends <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>either</b> nearly impossible (because of play balance mechanisms, since player elimination is usually considered an undesirable feature) or certainly unachievable (because victory conditions are triggered before extermination can be completed) in board games.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of human subjects, this {{involved}} injecting solutions containing (typically) five micrograms of plutonium into hospital patients thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>either</b> terminally ill, or {{to have a life}} expectancy of less than ten years either due to age or chronic disease condition. This was reduced to one microgram in July 1945 after animal studies found that the way plutonium distributed itself in bones was more dangerous than radium. Most of the subjects, Eileen Welsome says, were poor, powerless, and sick.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, he {{identified}} the hieroglyphic script on the Rosetta stone as being {{written in a}} mixture of ideograms and phonetic signs, just as Young had argued for Demotic. He reasoned that if the script was entirely ideographic the hieroglyphic text would require as many separate signs as there were separate words in the Greek text. But there were in fact fewer, suggesting that the script mixed ideographic and phonetic signs. This realization finally made it possible for him to detach himself from the idea that the different scripts had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>either</b> fully ideographic or fully phonetic, and he recognized it as being much more complex mixture of sign types. This realization gave him a distinct advantage.|$|E

5|$|In {{the solid}} state, flerovium is {{expected}} to be a dense metal due to its high atomic weight, with a density variously predicted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>either</b> 22g·cm−3 or 14g·cm−3. The electron of the hydrogen-like flerovium ion (oxidized so that it only has one electron, Fl113+) {{is expected to}} move so fast that it has a mass 1.79 times that of a stationary electron, due to relativistic effects. For comparison, the figures for hydrogen-like lead and tin are expected to be 1.25 and 1.073 respectively. Flerovium would form weaker metal–metal bonds than lead and would be adsorbed less on surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Instead, the {{argument}} considers the entire collection (jumla) of contingent things, {{the sum total}} of every contingent thing that exists, has existed, or will exist. Avicenna argues that this aggregate, too, must obey the rule that applies to a single contingent thing; in other words, it must have something outside itself that causes it to exist. This cause has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>either</b> contingent or necessary. It cannot be contingent, though, because if it were, it would already be included within the aggregate. Thus the only remaining possibility is that an external cause is necessary, and that cause must be a necessary existent.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{smallest}} species have become extinct, requiring vigilance in the conservation of the wild species. Narcissi are increasingly under threat by over-collection and threats to their natural habitats by urban development and tourism. N. cyclamineus has been considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>either</b> extinct or exceedingly rare but is not currently considered endangered, and is protected. The IUCN Red List describes five species as 'Endangered' (Narcissus alcaracensis, Narcissus bujei, Narcissus longispathus, Narcissus nevadensis, Narcissus radinganorum). In 1999 three species were considered endangered, five as vulnerable and six as rare.|$|E
