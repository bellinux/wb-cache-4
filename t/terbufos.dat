Microcosms dosed with a high concentration (10 μg/L) of the insecticide <b>terbufos,</b> alone and as a mixture with the herbicide atrazine (25 μg/L), exhibited community level effects attributed to the elimination and decline of invertebrate populations, and also indirect effects. There were no community level effects at a lower concentration of <b>terbufos</b> (0. 1 μg/L) alone or in a mixture with atrazine, although delayed population effects were observed. Female chironomids also emerged later and those from terbufos-only microcosms were smaller. Exposure to atrazine alone was also associated with lower abundances of cladocerans and reduced emergence of chironomids.

The mortality probabilities, based on behavior of moribund larvae, resulted in data that was more consistent with the assumptions underlying parameteric statistics and provided more precision {{when compared to the}} usually accepted alternate method of considering moribund larvae as dead. The rating system bioassay technique was used to study the effects of different soil factors on the relative decline in biological activity of six soil insecticides: carbofuran, chlorpyrifos, fonofos, isofenphos, phorate, and <b>terbufos.</b> Field studies (including one that altered pH with lime and sulfur) were conducted to measure the effects of soil pH, texture, organic matter, and moisture on insecticide persistence. In the laboratory, the LC 90 levels were determined for each insecticide in several soils. Studies measured the effects of moisture and temperature on the change in biological activity of the six insecticides in soils of varying texture, pH, and percent organic matter. All insecticides were influenced by pH, to varying degrees, in at least one test. Carbofuran persistence was most sensitive to increasing pH. The influence of soil texture was variable. Loss of carbofuran activity in sandy soils was attributed to leaching. Mortality from chlorpyrifos was inversely proportional to percent clay. Soil pH and texture influences on activity of fonofos and isofenphos were inconsistent. The effect of organic matter on biological activity of the insecticides was minimal. Regression models indicated that time accounted for approximately 55 % of variation in the activity of phorate and <b>terbufos</b> with little effect attributed to soil factors. Variation in chlorpyrifos mortality increased an average of 17 % (from 25 %) by the inclusion of soil factors in the models. The LC 90 s revealed that <b>terbufos</b> was the most toxic and fonofos the least toxic insecticide. Higher moisture levels accelerated the decline of fonofos and <b>terbufos</b> activity.

A total of 523 cases occurred among 54, 306 pesticide applicators from enrollment (1993 - 97) through December 31, 2011 in Iowa, and December 31, 2010 in North Carolina. Information on {{pesticide use}}, other agricultural exposures and other factors was obtained from questionnaires at enrollment and at follow-up approximately five years later (1999 - 2005). Information from questionnaires, monitoring, and the literature were used to create lifetime-days and intensity-weighted lifetime days of pesticide use, taking into account exposure-modifying factors. Poisson and polytomous models were used to calculate relative risks (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) to evaluate associations between 26 pesticides and NHL and five NHL-subtypes, while adjusting for potential confounding factors. For total NHL, statistically significant positive exposure-response trends were seen with lindane and DDT. <b>Terbufos</b> was associated with total NHL in ever/never comparisons only. In subtype analyses, <b>terbufos</b> and DDT were associated with small cell lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia/marginal cell lymphoma, lindane and diazinon with follicular lymphoma, and permethrin with MM. However, tests of homogeneity did not show significant differences in exposure-response among NHL-subtypes for any pesticide. Because 26 pesticides were evaluated for their association with NHL and its subtypes, some chance finding could have occurred.

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. June 2013. Major: Plant Pathology. Advisor: Dr. Senyu Chen. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); v, 136 pages. Soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines, {{is the major}} yield-limiting pathogen on soybean and various plant-parasitic nematodes can damage corn. Additionally, the nematode community is a useful bioindicator for soil health. In chapter 1, relevant research is reviewed. Chapter 2 describes experiments testing ten organic soil amendments at various rates for SCN control in the greenhouse. Some amendments-particularly canola meal, pennycress seed powder and condensed distiller's solubles-effectively reduced SCN populations at 40 days after planting soybeans. By 70 days after planting, SCN control by amendments was diminished. Additionally, phytotoxicity was a concern, particularly at 40 days after planting. Based on these experiments, organic soil amendments have value for SCN management, but more work is needed to optimize amendment efficacy particularly at the field scale. Chapter 3 describes the impact of tillage, granular nematicide (aldicarb or <b>terbufos),</b> synthetic fertilizers (NPKS combinations), and organic fertilizer (swine manure) on plant-parasitic nematodes, the nematode community, and plant yield as assessed in a corn-soybean cropping system. H. glycines, Helicotylenchus spp, Xiphinema spp, and Pratylenchus spp were the major plant-parasitic nematodes present at the sites. Tillage had only minor impacts on populations of major plant-parasitic nematode genera. While aldicarb reduced H. glycines and Helicotylenchus populations, albeit inconsistently, <b>terbufos</b> did not affect major plant-parasitic nematode populations. Nematicides increased soybean and corn yields under some conditions suggesting plant-parasitic nematodes impacted corn and soybean, although this impact was inconsistent. Tillage, fertilizer, and nematicide impacts on the nematode community were often site- and season-specific. Manure application compellingly shifted the nematode community to one of increased enrichment and decreased community structure. The inorganic fertilizers had minimal impact on the nematode community. Conventional tillage decreased nematode community structure based on some measures, but increased bacterivore and fungivore population densities. In contrast, aldicarb nematicide decreased bacterivore and fungivore population densities. Effects of <b>terbufos</b> nematicide on nematode populations and community composition were inconsistent...|$|E

In experiment 1, breakthrough time and contamination levels were studied by exposing alpha-cellulose backed glove material specimens to pesticide granules in petri dishes for set time periods up to 24 hours. In experiment 2, contaminated specimens were flushed with a flow of water or washed in a Launder-Ometer, using a set laundering protocol. In experiment 3, the 30 -minute exposure was followed by Launder-Ometer washing at two temperatures with and without detergent. Pesticide residues in glove specimens and cellulose pads were extracted with solvent. Residues in water solution were extracted with solid phase extraction. Gas chromatographs were used for residue analysis. Factorial analysis of variance was used to determine statistical differences in the various experimental treatments. Linear regression was used to identify whether there was a linear relationship between contamination and exposure time;The breakthrough time of glove materials to granular <b>terbufos</b> or tefluthrin was more than 24 hours. A positive linear relationship between contamination and exposure time was found. Pesticide composition, glove material, exposure time, cleanup methods, and detergent significantly affected the reduction of contamination.

40|$|Background. Lipid {{metabolism}} processes {{have been}} implicated in prostate carcinogenesis. Since several pesticides are lipophilic or are metabolized via lipid-related mechanisms, they may interact with variants of genes in the lipid metabolism pathway. Methods. In a nested case-control study of 776 cases and 1444 controls from the Agricultural Health Study (AHS), a prospective cohort study of pesticide applicators, we examined the interactions between 39 pesticides (none, low, and high exposure) and 220 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 59 genes.

Treatments were commercial corn hybrids (OSSK 444, OSSK 552, Florencia,) and three soil insecticides (terbuphos, chlorpyriphos-ethyl, chlormephos) applied at planting. Results showed the highest number of larvae per plant (0. 70) in the untreated plot of OSSK 552. In 1999, significant differences in larval numbers occurred among hybrids, but not among the insecticides. In 2000, larval numbers only differed statistically between the insecticide treatments.

40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} comparative degradation of six organophosphorus insecticides in soil as affected by enhanced microbial degradation. The degradation rates and product distributions of chlorpyrifos, fonofos, ethoprop, <b>terbufos,</b> and phorate were not dramatically altered in soils containing microbial populations adapted to rapidly degrade isofenphos. An Arthrobacter sp. isolated from soils {{with a history}} of isofenphos use rapidly metabolized isofenphos in pure culture but did not metabolize or cometabolize any of the other five organophosphorus insecticides. Likewise, only fonofos was rapidly degraded in soil with a long history of fonofos use. None of the organophosphorus insecticides were rapidly degraded in soil containing carbofuran-degrading microbial populations. Results indicate that the phenomenon of enhanced microbial degradation of soil insecticides may exhibit some degree of specificity...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{insecticides}} {{were evaluated}} in laboratory and field studies against larvae of an insecticide resistant population (Phelps County, NE) of western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte. Insecticide toxicity was evaluated by topical application of technical insecticides to 3 rd instars from Saunders County, NE (susceptible) and Phelps County populations. Resistance ratios (LD 50 Phelps County/LD 50 Saunders County) for the insecticides methyl parathion, tefluthrin, carbofuran, <b>terbufos,</b> and chlorpyrifos were 28. 0, 9. 3, 8. 7, 2. 6 and 1. 3, respectively. Biochemical investigation of suspected enzymatic resistance mechanisms in 3 rd instars identified significant elevation of esterase activity (alpha and beta naphthyl acetate hydrolysis [3. 8 - and 3. 9 -fold]). Examination of 3 rd instar esterases by native PAGE identified increased intensity of several isoenzymes in the resistant population. Assays of cytochrome P 450 activity (4 -CNMA demethylation and aldrin epoxidation) {{did not identify}} elevated activity in resistant 3 rd instars. Granular soil insecticides were applied at planting to corn, Zea mays L., in replicated field trials in 1997 and 1998 at the same Phelps County site {{as the source of}} resistant rootworms for the laboratory studies. In 1997, planting time applications of Counter 20 CR, Counter 15 G (<b>terbufos),</b> and Lorsban 15 G (chlorpyrifos) resulted in the lowest root injury ratings (1 Ð 6 Iowa scale); 2. 50, 2. 55, 2. 65, respectively (untreated check root rating of 4. 55). In 1998, all insecticides performed similarly against a lower rootworm density (untreated check root rating of 3. 72). These studies suggest that resistance previously documented in adults also is present in 3 rd instars, esterases are possibly involved as resistance mechanisms, and resistance to methyl parathion in adults is also evident in larvae, but does not confer cross-resistance in larvae to all organophosphate insecticides...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo do trabalho foi estudar a seletividade de herbicidas para a cultura da cana-de-açúcar quando aplicado em culturas tratadas com nematicidas. O experimento foi instalado em área pertencente à Usina São José, município de Borebi-SP, ano agrícola de 2000 / 01. A variedade de cana-de-açúcar utilizada foi a RB 855113. Utilizou-se o delineamento {{experimental}} de blocos ao acaso em parcelas subdivididas, com quatro repetições. Cada parcela correspondeu a 27 linhas de 10, 0 m, espaçadas em 1, 0 m, sendo dividida em três subparcelas. As parcelas corresponderam aos tratamentos com os herbicidas, e as subparcelas, à aplicação ou não dos nematicidas carbofuran (2, 10 kg ha- 1) e <b>terbufós</b> 2, 25 kg ha��). Os herbicidas testados foram: tebuthiuron (1, 12 kg ha- 1), ametryne (1, 75 kg ha¹), sulfentrazone (0, 8 kg ha- 1), metribuzin (1, 92 kg ha- 1), isoxaflutole (0, 0525 kg ha¹), clomazone (1, 25 kg ha¹), oxyfluorfen (0, 36 kg ha- 1) e azafenidin+hexazinone (0, 1575 + 0, 2025 kg ha- 1), sendo todos aplicados em pré-emergência, além de uma parcela como testemunha. Os resultados obtidos evidenciaram que os herbicidas oxyfluorfen e azafenidin+hexazinone causaram os maiores níveis de fitotoxicidade na cana-de-açúcar, independentemente do uso dos nematicidas carbofuran e <b>terbufós.</b> Os herbicidas tebuthiuron, ametryne, sulfentrazone, metribuzin, isoxaflutole, clomazone, oxyfluorfen e azafenidin+hexazinone, aplicados em doses representativas das comercialmente utilizadas, mostraram-se seletivos à cana-de-açúcar, não afetando seu crescimento, sua produtividade e suas características tecnológicas. Os nematicidas não interferiram nos níveis de intoxicação provocados pelos herbicidas utilizados na cultura. The {{objective of}} this work was to study the selectivity of herbicides to sugarcane when applied in crops treated with nematicides. The experiment {{was carried out in}} Borebi, São Paulo-Brazil, during the growing season 2000 / 2001. The sugar cane variety RB 855113 was used. The experimental design was a randomized block in split-plots with 4 repetitions. Each plot corresponded to 27 rows of 10. 0 m, 1. 0 m spaced, split into three sub-plots. The plots corresponded to the treatments with the herbicides and the sub-plots to the application or not of the nematicides carbofuran (2. 10 kg ha- 1) and <b>terbufos</b> (2. 25 kg ha- 1). The following herbicides were studied: tebuthiuron (1. 12 kg ha- 1), ametryne (1. 75 kg ha- 1), sulfentrazone (0. 8 kg ha- 1), metribuzin (1. 92 kg ha¹), isoxaflutole (0. 0525 kg ha- 1), clomazone (1. 25 kg ha- 1), oxyfluorfen (0. 36 kg ha- 1) and azafenidin+ hexazinone (0. 1575 + 0. 2025 kg ha- 1). All the herbicides were applied in pre-emergence. The results showed that the herbicides oxyfluorfen and azafenidin+hexazinone caused the most severe phytotoxicity symptoms. Regardless of nematicide application, all the herbicides were selective to the crop, providing growth rates and yields similar to the controls. The selectivity of the herbicides was not affected by the nematicides...|$|E

Treatments included 1, 3 -dichloropropene (1, 3 -D), fenamiphos, phorate, <b>terbufos,</b> aldicarb, and 1, 3 -D + aldicarb. Average R. reniformis population densities across all treatments increased from 5, 284 at 10 days after planting to a final density at harvest of 15, 622 nematodes/ 500 cm³ soil. The 1, 3 -D + aldicarb combination was the only treatment with an average R. reniformis population density significantly (P ≤ 0. 05) lower than that of the untreated control. Seedling stand at 28 days after planting was significantly less in aldicarb-treated plots than in control plots. Plant height was significantly greater in plots treated with nematicides than in the controls. Seed cotton yield was significantly greater from treated plots.

40|$|Sorption and {{movement}} of two ionic herbicides (2, 4 -D and atrazine) and two non-ionic insecticides (phorate and <b>terbufos)</b> in an allophanic (Patua silt loam) and a non-allophanic (Tokomaru silt loam) soil were examined using 14 C-labelled pesticides. For sorption measurements, {{a range of}} concentrations of pesticide solutions in 0. 1 M calcium chloride were shaken with soil samples at a soil:solution ratio of 1 : 10 for 4 h at 25 °C. The movement of pesticides was examined using re-packed soil columns following a step input of 2, 4 -D and tritiated water (3 H 2 O) and a pulse input of 2, 4 -D, atrazine, phorate and <b>terbufos.</b> A convection-dispersion equation (CDE), either with an equilibrium or a bicontinuum non-equilibrium sorption process, was used to simulate the measured effluent breakthrough curves (BTCs) obtained by simultaneous displacement of a non-sorbed solute (3 H 2 O) and a sorbed solute (2, 4 -D). The Patua soil sorbed more pesticide than did the Tokomaru soil. This is attributed to the larger amounts of organic matter {{and the presence of}} short-range order clays (allophane) in the former soil compared to the latter. Kinetic sorption data for pesticides showed an initial rapid rate followed by a slower rate of sorption. In column experiments, the pesticide in the leachate appeared later in the Patua than in the Tokomaru soil. Movement of pesticides in soils decreased with an increase in Kd values. The step-function experiments showed a symmetrical BTC for the non-sorbed solute (3 H 2 O) with a sigmoidal shape, whereas there was an asymmetrical BTC with extensive tailing for the sorbed solute (2, 4 -D). The CDE with an equilibrium sorption process adequately described the 3 H 2 O BTC, but failed to simulate the BTC for 2, 4 -D. The CDE with a bicontinuum non-equilibrium sorption process provided a good description of the BTC for 2, 4 -D. Diffusion of pesticides into sorbent organic matter was considered to be the likely mechanism for the observed sorption non-equilibrium during the movement of pesticides in soils. S. Baskaran, N. S.

40|$|Monsanto Co. (St. Louis, MO) has {{received}} {{approval for the}} commercial sale of transgenic corn (Zea mays L.) modified to produce insecticidal protein (Cry 3 Bb 1) from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bt) {{for control of the}} western corn rootworm larvae, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte and northern corn rootworm, D. barberi Smith and Lawrence; southern corn rootworm. This new technology could help reduce the amount of pesticides applied to corn fields for control of these pests and provides an alternative management strategy. The first objective was to determine if the fitness of beetles surviving from transgenic corn was affected. Female adults emerging from transgenic treatments were the same size as females from <b>terbufos</b> and isoline treatments but laid fewer eggs. Transgenic corn did not affect percent egg hatch. Females from YieldGard Rootworm and <b>terbufos</b> flew significantly shorter distances than females from isoline and YieldGard Plus treatments. Virgin females from did not fly sustained flights. Mated females from isoline and transgenic treatments flew farther than virgin females. The second objective was to examine similar questions but of adult beetles who had been exposed to the leaves and silks of transgenic plants. Beetles exposed to leaves or silks of transgenic plants did not fly significantly different than beetles exposed to nontransgenic plants. Beetles caged on leaves of transgenic plants for 5 days had higher mortality, consumed less leaf area, and laid fewer eggs than beetles caged on leaves of nontransgenic plants. Very little mortality occurred in beetles exposed to the silks of transgenic plants. Exposure to silks of transgenic plants did not affect egg laying or adult longevity. The third objective was to evaluate farmer perceptions and attitudes of transgenic corn using a survey. When asked if they would plant transgenic corn protected again the corn rootworm, 35. 0 % responded they would while 40. 5 % said they were unsure. The two biggest concerns farmers had of transgenic corn was the ability to sell harvested grain and additional technology fees. Farmers felt that less insecticide in the environment and less insecticide exposure to farmers were significant benefits of transgenic corn. The most common refuge-planting options farmers favored were adjacent fields and split fields...|$|E
40|$|Sweet corn {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} vegetable crops produced in New York, in terms of acreage, crop value and number of producers. Fresh market and processing sweet corn are produced for local, regional, and national markets. With the exception of rust and seed decay, sweet corn has relatively few disease problems relative to other vegetables. A wide variety of insects attack the crop, causing losses in yield as well as quality. However quality is critical, especially in the fresh market wholesale business. Wholesale buyers of sweet corn can reject entire shipments if damage levels are as low as 10 %. New York sweet corn producers generally use sound integrated pest management practices in managing insects and other pests. While a relatively large number of insecticides are registered for use, organophosphates remain important tools for resistance management and/or control for pests such as seed corn maggot, flea beetles, garden symphylans, and aphids. Weeds are also major pests of sweet corn. Without the registration of new, effective materials to replace them, the loss of chlorpyrifos, diazinon, <b>terbufos,</b> atrazine, alachlor, metolachlor, bentazon, and propiconazole would have significant impacts on production and profitability...|$|E

To explore the association of pesticides with wheeze in a population without other farming exposures, the authors analyzed data from 2, 255 Iowa commercial pesticide applicators enrolled in the Agricultural Health Study. Controlling for age, smoking status, asthma and atopy history, and body mass index, the authors calculated odds ratios {{for the relationship between}} wheeze and 36 individual pesticides participants had used during the year before enrollment (1993 – 1997). Eight of 16 herbicides were associated with wheeze in single-agent models; however, the risk was almost exclusively associated with the herbicide chlorimuron-ethyl (odds ratio (OR) 1. 62, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 25, 2. 10). Inclusion of chlorimuron-ethyl in models for the other herbicides virtually eliminated the associations. The odds ratios for four organophosphate insecticides (<b>terbufos,</b> fonofos, chlorpyrifos, and phorate) were elevated when these chemicals were modeled individually and remained elevated, though attenuated somewhat, when chlorimuron-ethyl was included. The association for dichlorvos, another organophosphate insecticide, was not attenuated by chlorimuron-ethyl (OR 2. 48, 95 % CI: 1. 08, 5. 66).
