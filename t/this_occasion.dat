5|$|The Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos welcomed him and {{arranged}} Stephen's marriage with his niece Maria Komnene. According to Gerhoh of Reichersberg, Stephen converted to the Orthodox Church on <b>this</b> <b>occasion.</b> Stephen's brother, Ladislaus, also arrived in Constantinople around 1160, {{but he refused}} to marry a relative of the Emperor.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{housing and}} land {{shortage}} existed in nearby Smethwick County Borough, which {{also resulted in}} the authority acquiring land from adjoining council areas. By 1914; the urban area of Bearwood had already spread over the border of Oldbury Urban District as far as Rathbone Road and Warley Park. A further adjustment of the county boundary took place in 1928 and on <b>this</b> <b>occasion</b> however, Staffordshire gained territory from Worcestershire at Warley Woods (See Fig 4). This enabled Smethwick to build new housing estates at Londonderry and {{to the west of}} Rathbone Road.|$|E

5|$|After McDonnell {{had made}} 103 out of 158, Murdoch and Scott {{completed}} the first double-century partnership in Test cricket. England, as the score mounted, used 11 bowlers: {{the first time}} in Test cricket that an entire team including the wicketkeeper was called upon to bowl. On <b>this</b> <b>occasion,</b> the wicketkeeper Lyttelton was the most successful bowler, taking 4/19. Grace, keeping wicket to Lyttelton, took a catch to dismiss Midwinter.|$|E
5|$|Andrew {{returned}} to Hungary {{at the beginning}} of 1290. On <b>this</b> <b>occasion,</b> Lodomer, Archbishop of Esztergom, also urged him to come, since the archbishop wanted to dethrone the excommunicated LadislausIV with the assistance of Ivan Kőszegi. Before Andrew was successful, Arnold Hahót, an enemy of the Kőszegis, invited him to the fort of Štrigova and captured him. Hahót sent Andrew to Vienna, where Albert I, Duke of Austria, held him in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Dibnah {{had watched}} the {{activities}} of steeplejacks throughout his childhood, and witnessed his first chimney felling from his father's allotment near Bolton's greyhound track at Raikes Park. The steeplejacks first removed {{the top of the}} chimney and then created a hole in its base, propped with blocks of wood. They then lit a fire, destroying the supports and causing the chimney to collapse. Unfortunately, on <b>this</b> <b>occasion</b> the chimney fell in the wrong direction, onto the greyhound track's dog kennels, a local cafe and a series of power cables.|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>occasioned</b> a vast {{variety of}} cases, which {{physicians}} would {{have much more}} opportunity to remember than I; but some came within the compass of my observation or hearing, of which I shall name a few.|$|R
50|$|By September 1888, the Yeppoon {{community}} again {{wrote to}} the Department of Public Instruction, on <b>this</b> <b>occasions</b> requesting an application form {{for the establishment of}} a state school. The formal application was sent on 31 October 1888.|$|R
50|$|Again {{outgrowing}} {{its capacity}} in the second year, the A*Devantgarde Festival was for financial reasons forced to scale back in 1993. <b>This</b> <b>occasioned</b> a move to the New Theater, an intimate and minimalist space in which the performances thrived.|$|R
5|$|During {{the trial}} in January 1972 Bukovsky was accused of slandering Soviet psychiatry, {{contacts}} with foreign journalists, and the possession and distribution of samizdat. On <b>this</b> <b>occasion</b> he again used his final words to the court to reach a much wider audience when the text circulated in samizdat. He was sentenced {{to two years in}} prison, five in a labour camp, and five more in internal exile.|$|E
5|$|He {{added that}} while he regretted that his message had been disowned by Lord Kenmare, that was of less consequence, since his {{manoeuvre}} had succeeded to admiration. Some believe that Sir Boyle, who was related to Lord Kenmare and often represented his views in Commons, was also stating Lord Kenmare's true views on <b>this</b> <b>occasion</b> and doing so with his full knowledge, {{but in a way}} that provided Kenmare plausible deniability.|$|E
5|$|Hungarian chronicles have {{preserved}} a story full of fabulous or anachronistic {{details of}} the two brothers' ensuing wanderings. For instance, they narrate that Andrew and Levente were captured by Cumans, but the latter only arrived in Europe in the 1050s. Having faced many hardships, Andrew and Levente established themselves {{in the court of}} Yaroslav the Wise, Grand Prince of Kiev (r. 1019–1054) in the late 1030s. The grand prince gave his daughter, Anastasia in marriage to Andrew. Kristó writes that Andrew, who had up to that time remained pagan, was baptized on <b>this</b> <b>occasion.</b>|$|E
50|$|Godfrey became infamous for peremptorily firing employees, such as Julius LaRosa, {{fired on}} the air, and in April of 1955 he fired Kahauolopua (along with Marion Marlowe, The Mariners, and three writers). <b>This</b> <b>occasioned</b> some {{criticism}} in the press.|$|R
60|$|Uncle John went to {{the city}} every morning, and at first <b>this</b> <b>occasioned</b> no remark. Patsy was too {{occupied}} to {{pay much attention to}} her uncle's coming and going, and the Major was indifferent, being busy admiring Patsy's happiness and congratulating himself on his own good fortune.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{there be}} any other matter about which you wish to speak on <b>this</b> <b>occasions,</b> do so freely."

5|$|It {{was moved}} to its current {{location}} on St George's Street {{at the edge of}} the village, although the date when this was done is unclear. The site where the cross now stands was levelled in 1776 by workmen, paid by Henry Fownes Luttrell, and it may have been on <b>this</b> <b>occasion</b> that the cross was moved. An alternative local tradition is that it was moved in 1825, although a drawing by J. M. W. Turner made in 1811 suggests it was in its present position by then.|$|E
5|$|King {{joined the}} Philadelphia Cricket Club after the 1912 season. Despite being well past his 40th year, he {{continued}} to play competitive cricket for another 4 years. His 27-year career ended with his last game for the Philadelphia Cricket Club against Frankford, on July 20, 1916. On <b>this</b> <b>occasion,</b> his bowling and batting skills had declined, but he maintained a batting average of 43.33 for that final season.|$|E
5|$|Maha Chakkraphat {{decided to}} leave the capital with his forces, to engage Tabinshwehti and test the Burmese strength. On <b>this</b> <b>occasion,</b> he mounted his chief war elephant. Accompanying him were his Chief Queen, Sri Suriyothai, and one of their young daughters, Princess Boromdhilok, the two riding {{together}} on a smaller war elephant. Both royal ladies were dressed in male military attire (helmet and armour), with the queen wearing the uniform of an Uparaja. Also accompanying their father on elephant mounts were two sons, the Uparaja and heir apparent, Prince Ramesuan, and his brother Prince Mahin.|$|E
60|$|A {{number of}} cowboys were waiting. She {{explained}} {{the situation and}} left them in charge of her home. With that she asked Nels to accompany her down into the desert. He turned white to his lips, and <b>this</b> <b>occasioned</b> Madeline to remember his mortal dread {{of the car and}} Link's driving.|$|R
60|$|Dec. 10. No sooner did I {{think my}} {{habitation}} finished, but suddenly {{a great deal}} of the top broke in, so that it was a mercy I was not buried in the ruins. <b>This</b> <b>occasioned</b> {{a great deal of}} pains and trouble to me, before I could make it firm and durable.|$|R
50|$|In 1847, {{eight years}} after {{succeeding}} his father as Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, Richard was declared bankrupt with debts over a million pounds. <b>This</b> <b>occasioned</b> the auction sale {{of the contents of}} Stowe House in August-September 1848, one of the handful of most prominent English country house contents auctions of the 19th century.|$|R
5|$|Mhalsa is {{believed}} to be a combined avatara of Mohini and Parvati. Mhalsa was born as the daughter of a rich merchant in Newase called Tirmarsheth. On the divine orders of Khandoba in a dream to Tirmarsheth, she was married to Khandoba on Pausha Pournima(the full moon day of Hindu calendar month of Paush) in Pali(Pembar).

5|$|Queen Catherine died {{in early}} 1464 during {{preparations}} for her husband's coronation with the Holy Crown, {{which had been}} returned by Emperor Frederick. The ceremony {{was carried out in}} full accordance with the customary law of Hungary on 29 March 1464; Archbishop of Esztergom Dénes Szécsi ceremoniously put the Holy Crown on Matthias's head in Székesfehérvár. At the Diet assembled on <b>this</b> <b>occasion,</b> the newly crowned King confirmed the liberties of the nobility. Hereafter the legality of Matthias's reign could not be questioned.|$|E
60|$|All {{kinds of}} {{handicrafts}} in the city, &c., tradesmen and mechanics, were, as I have said before, out of employ; and <b>this</b> <b>occasioned</b> the putting-off and dismissing an innumerable number of journeymen and workmen of all sorts, seeing {{nothing was done}} relating to such trades but what might {{be said to be}} absolutely necessary.|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>occasioned</b> {{a letter}} to my Lord Fairfax, wherein our general {{returning}} the civilities, and neither accepting nor refusing his proposal, put it upon his honour, whether there was not some agreement or concession between his Majesty and the Parliament, in order to a general peace, which this treaty might be prejudicial to, or thereby be prejudicial to us.|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>occasioned</b> him uneasiness {{because they}} would soon be down on a level, where palls of dust {{threatened}} to close over the whole valley, {{and it would be}} impossible to see any considerable distance.

5|$|Rush {{organised}} an Aquatic Carnival at Grafton, held on 2 January 1888, {{as part of}} {{the national}} celebrations marking the centenary of European settlement in Australia. The event attracted many up-and-coming scullers, including future World Champion Henry Searle, and even Ned Hanlan, who declined to compete due to illness, though he gave an exhibition of 'trick' sculling. Rush rowed his last professional match on <b>this</b> <b>occasion,</b> {{as a member of a}} pair-oar crew.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{days later}} he {{received}} permission for another daylight sortie. Squadron Leader Robertson joined him on <b>this</b> <b>occasion</b> as his flight engineer. He flew to Lasham {{to pick up a}} Mosquito. His target on <b>this</b> <b>occasion</b> would be Denmark. The Luftwaffe kept a number of operational units in the region so he flew to Coltishall in Norfolk to be nearer his destination and conserve fuel during the sortie. Near Aalborg he sighted two aircraft. So far away from the battle zones, the Germans did not expect to be attacked by the enemy. Neither made much attempt to defend themselves. The first, a Junkers W 34 transport, was shot down and the second, a Junkers Ju 52, tried a crash-landing only to nose-over and crumple the wings. Braham strafed it to ensure destruction. His gun cameras filmed the action during which he fired 320 rounds. On 4 April he returned to France. Lacking radar, Braham sought out large airfields to be sure of intercepting an enemy aircraft. He flew to Bordeaux looking for He 177s that intelligence suggested were operating against Atlantic convoys from Bordeaux–Mérignac. Braham only encountered a Bücker Bü 131 which fell victim after a brief burst of fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{match was}} Hibs' 12th {{appearance}} in the Scottish Cup final and Hearts' 14th. Hibs had previously won two finals and Hearts had won seven. Because both teams were from Edinburgh, {{many of the city}} councillors requested that the final be held in Edinburgh at Murrayfield Stadium, instead of the traditional venue of Hampden, in Glasgow. The previous final between the two clubs in 1896 had been held in Edinburgh but on <b>this</b> <b>occasion</b> it stayed in Glasgow.|$|E
50|$|This year, 2017, {{will be the}} 100th year anniversary {{for this}} school.

5000|$|In 1885, Crapsey {{was feeling}} [...] "discouragement," [...] {{both because of}} [...] "a sense of {{personal}} failure" [...] and [...] "a disillusionment in the Christian Church as a whole." [...] He described his disillusionment in a sermon at a Presbyterian Church in Rochester. <b>This</b> <b>occasioned</b> Crapseys first run-in with Bishop Walker because Walker had specifically forbidden Crapsey to preach in a Presbyterian Church.|$|R
