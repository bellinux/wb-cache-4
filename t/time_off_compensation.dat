50|$|An {{employment}} agreement {{may contain}} a clause that states an employee must work overtime when requested. If {{this is the}} case then a refusal to work overtime is a breach of the employment agreement. If there is no clause regarding overtime, then the 40 hours per week is the maximum set by the Minimum Wage Act. Employment Agreements of salaried employees often contain a clause like this:The salary/wages for this position cover all time worked in meeting the performance requirements and the employee is not entitled to additional payment for time worked outside the normal hours specified. However, where a significant number of additional hours are worked, the employer will, if possible allow the employee to take <b>time</b> <b>off</b> in <b>compensation</b> for the additional hours worked.As a result, 20% of New Zealanders work more than 50 hours a week. An OECD study shows that New Zealander's now work some of the longest hours in the Western world - 1826 hours a year, compared with the OECD average of 1778. In response, the Flexible Working Arrangements Act was passed on 21 November 2007. It aims to allow employees who are also caregivers to request more flexible working hours.|$|R
40|$|The National Occupational Health and Safety Commission of Australia has {{identified}} musculoskeletal {{injuries in the}} health industry as a key area of concern. There is little data available on injuries to physiotherapists. This study aimed to investigate the nature, prevalence, job risk factors and consequences of occupational injuries, with particular focus on musculoskeletal injuries, experienced by physiotherapists in North and Central Queensland. A work–related musculoskeletal injury was defined as pain lasting more than three days that the respondent felt was caused by their work as a physiotherapist. Fifty–five percent of respondents had experienced a work–related injury and 40 % had experienced injury in the previous year. The most injured body areas were the low back, hands and neck. Over half (56 %) of the initial episodes of injury occurred within five years of graduation. The job risk factors of most concern to injured respondents were sustained demanding postures, manual therapy techniques, repetition, working while injured and excessive workloads. Injured respondents chose to work while injured and not to take <b>time</b> <b>off</b> on workers’ <b>compensation</b> or have surgery. Following injury, 38 % of respondents changed work settings. Most injured physiotherapists modified their techniques to continue working. Further {{research is needed to}} develop effective preventative strategies...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} the nature, extent {{and costs of}} injuries to health care workers caused by physical abuse. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Large acute and tertiary care teaching hospital in Winnipeg. PARTICIPANTS: All health care workers at the hospital who filed reports of abuse-related injuries and of verbal abuse and threatening behaviour from Apr. 1, 1991, to Mar. 31, 1993. OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of physical and verbal abuse of hospital personnel according to job category, type of injury, hours of staff time lost and estimates of costs compensated for abuse-related injuries. RESULTS: Of the 242 reported abuse-related injuries 194 (80. 2 %) occurred among the nursing personnel. The nurses in the medical units filed most (33. 1 %) of the reports. Although the psychiatric nurses filed fewer reports (35 [14. 5 %]) they had {{the highest rate of}} injuries per 100, 000 paid hours among the nursing staff. Not surprisingly, the security officers were at highest risk, 53. 5 % having reported an abuse-related injury for a rate of 16. 8 such injuries per 100, 000 paid hours. Male staff members had a higher injury rate than their female counterparts in all occupational groups. Bruising or crushing was the most frequent type of injury (in 126 cases); the next most frequent were cuts and lacerations (in 47) and human bites and exposures to blood or body fluids (in 23). However, the 36 sprains and strains resulted in the largest amount of time lost. In all, over 8000 hours were lost due to abuse-related injuries, and over $ 76, 000 was paid in workers' compensation benefits. Concurrently, 646 incidents of verbal abuse and threatening behaviour were reported. Only three abuse-related injuries and two incidents of verbal abuse were reported by physicians. CONCLUSIONS: Abuse-related injuries to health care workers in an urban hospital are prevalent, serious and can be costly in terms of <b>time</b> <b>off</b> work and <b>compensation.</b> Underreporting is likely, especially among physicians...|$|R

Measures of visual <b>time</b> <b>off</b> road, steering wheel deviations and safety perception were performed with young and old drivers during real traffic. The results showed an effect of both driver's age and button location on the dependent variables. Older drivers spent longer visual <b>time</b> <b>off</b> road when pushing the buttons and had larger steering wheel deviations. Moreover, the greater the eccentricity between the normal line of sight and the button locations, the longer the visual <b>time</b> <b>off</b> road and the larger the steering wheel deviations. No interaction effect between button location and age was found with regard to visual <b>time</b> <b>off</b> road.

40|$|Abstract Relatively {{little is}} known about the role that leave policies—family, parental, or maternity-leave policies—play in facilitating <b>time</b> <b>off</b> work after child-birth. Yet <b>time</b> <b>off</b> is a {{critical}} element of leave policies, as it facilitates the mother’s recovery from childbirth and promotes maternal-infant attachment. Using data from Minnesota, the state with the highest rate of female labor force participation, we examine the extent to which policies, relative to personal, job, and workplace char-acteristics, determine the duration of women’s childbirth-related leaves from work. A random sample of women identified from vital statistics records is used to estimate the relationship between leave policies and <b>time</b> <b>off</b> work after childbirth. Of our sample 85 percent had access to some paid leave benefits, although only 46 percent had paid maternity leave benefits. The difference in duration of leave between women with and without paid leave policies was approximately four weeks, a substantial dif-ference for most women and their infants. Paid leave policies and spousal earnings as primary determinants of maternal <b>time</b> <b>off</b> work, suggest problems in the use of unpaid leave for economically vulnerable women.
