5|$|Kratos is {{a warrior}} who serves the Greek gods of Olympus. Flashbacks reveal {{that he was}} once a {{successful}} captain in the Spartan army and led his men to several victories before being defeated by a barbarian king. Facing death, Kratos called on the God of War, Ares, whom he promised to serve if the god would spare his men and provide the power to destroy their enemies. Ares agreed and bonded <b>the</b> <b>Blades</b> of Chaos, a pair of chained blades forged {{in the depths of}} Tartarus, to his new servant. Kratos, equipped with <b>the</b> <b>blades,</b> then decapitated the barbarian king.|$|E
5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} <b>the</b> <b>Blades</b> of Exile, {{replacing}} <b>the</b> <b>Blades</b> of Athena used in previous installments {{and the opening}} moments of this game. The weapon {{is a pair of}} blades that are attached to chains wrapped around the character's wrists and forearms, which can be swung in a number of maneuvers. During the game, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Claws of Hades, the Nemean Cestus, and the Nemesis Whip—with other combat options. The Nemean Cestus, a pair of gauntlets, and the Nemesis Whip, which is similar to <b>the</b> <b>Blades</b> of Exile, are required to advance in parts of the game; for example, the Nemean Cestus is needed to break through objects composed of onyx.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>blades</b> are transtibial prostheses, {{meaning they}} replace {{legs and feet}} that are amputated below the knee (BK). They were {{developed}} by medical engineer Van Phillips who incorporated Flex-Foot, Inc., in 1984, and in 2000 sold the company to Össur which now (in 2012) manufactures <b>the</b> <b>blades.</b> They are designed to store kinetic energy like a spring, allowing the wearer to jump and run effectively.|$|E
50|$|When {{the button}} is {{depressed}} (sideways into the handle or, as illustrated, into the page) a slot in it aligns with <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> and allows <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> to move forward. When <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> is fully extended flanges on <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> engage pins on the cocking arm retarding <b>the</b> <b>blade's</b> motion. <b>The</b> <b>blade</b> {{is locked in}} position when the rear notch of <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> allows <b>the</b> button to return to its rest position. Even if the button is pressed spring tension holds the knife open.|$|R
50|$|Macon blades are symmetrical, with an {{elliptical}} {{shape and}} a ridgeline {{running down the}} center of <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> face. <b>The</b> <b>blade</b> is squared off at the end. Despite <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> being symmetrical, modern asymmetrical collars or aesthetic issues regarding decorative paint on <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> face may dictate which side of <b>the</b> boat <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> can be rowed on.|$|R
50|$|To retract <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> <b>the</b> button {{is again}} pressed {{so that its}} slot aligns with <b>the</b> <b>blade.</b> <b>The</b> cocking arm is pulled {{backwards}} which itself pulls <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> backward. When <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> is fully retracted the spring mounted button rests in the forward notch and again pops up and locks <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> in <b>the</b> cocked position. The cocking arm is then manually pushed forward to again sit flush with the handle.|$|R
5|$|Wind {{turbines}} {{are affected}} by wind shear. Vertical wind-speed profiles result in different wind speeds at <b>the</b> <b>blades</b> nearest to the ground level compared to those {{at the top of}} blade travel, and this in turn affects the turbine operation. This low level wind shear can create a large bending moment in the shaft of a two bladed turbine when <b>the</b> <b>blades</b> are vertical. The reduced wind shear over water means shorter and less expensive wind turbine towers can be used in shallow seas.|$|E
5|$|A {{controversy}} over the effects of running blade length arose at the 2012 Paralympic Games, as Brazilian runner Alan Oliveira and USA runner Blake Leeper changed to longer running blades {{within a few months}} before the 2012 Paralympic Games. This led to marked improvement in their running times. Pistorius complained after the 200m race that <b>the</b> <b>blades</b> provided artificially lengthened running strides, which would be an infringement of the IPC rules, regardless of that <b>the</b> <b>blades</b> were within the allowable height limits for the athletes concerned. His complaint was supported by single-leg runners including Jerome Singleton and Jack Swift, who called for the T43 double blade and T44 single blade classes to be separated in future events, as single blade runners were unable to adjust the height of the prostheses, and must always match the length of their biological leg with a running blade.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of God of War, Kratos had been serving the gods for ten years and had grown tired of his service and nightmares. When he confronted his patron Athena, she advised {{him that if he}} killed the rampaging Ares, the gods would forgive his sins. With this selfish motive, he again agreed, and after finding and using Pandora's Box, he was successful. Despite being freed of Ares' influence, {{including}} <b>the</b> <b>Blades</b> of Chaos, Kratos was forgiven but was not relieved of his nightmares. A dissatisfied and despairing Kratos tried to commit suicide but was saved by Athena, who guided him to Olympus. Awarded <b>the</b> <b>Blades</b> of Athena, Kratos became the new God of War.|$|E
50|$|The Peurawot has {{a single}} edge blade with a slight curvature. The width of <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> is about <b>the</b> same from the base {{to the tip of}} <b>the</b> <b>blade.</b> <b>The</b> <b>blade</b> does not have a central ridge and back of <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> is {{somewhat}} concave. The cutting edge of <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> is a little concave in shape. This knife is sometimes adorned with a golden or suasa sampa (decoration of the hilt near <b>the</b> <b>blade)</b> and tampo (knob of the hilt).|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{failure of}} <b>the</b> first stage <b>blade</b> in a steam turbine of 55 MW was investigated. <b>The</b> <b>blade</b> {{was made of}} 17 - 4 PH {{stainless}} steel and {{has been used for}} 12 years before failure. The current work aims to find out the main cause of <b>the</b> first stage <b>blade</b> failure. <b>The</b> methods for investigation were metallurgical analysis, chemical composition test, and hardness measurement. The result showed that there was no evidence <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> failure was due to material. The damage found on <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> namely crack on <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> root. Two locations of the crack observed at <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> root, which was at the tang and the fillet, with different failure modes. In general, the damage of <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> was started by the corrosion occurred on <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> root. <b>The</b> crack at <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> root tang was due to corrosion fatigue and the crack occurred at <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> root fillet owing to stress corrosion cracking...|$|R
50|$|Various rapier masters divided <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> into two, three, four, five or even nine parts. The forte, strong, is {{that part}} of <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> closest to <b>the</b> hilt; in cases where a master divides <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> into an even number of parts, this is the first half of <b>the</b> <b>blade.</b> <b>The</b> , weak, is the part of <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> which {{includes}} <b>the</b> point and is the second half of <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> when <b>the</b> sword is divided into an even number of parts. However, some rapier masters divided <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> into three parts (or even a multiple of three), in which case the central third of <b>the</b> <b>blade,</b> between <b>the</b> forte and the debole, was often called the medio, mezzo or the terzo. Others used four divisions (Fabris) or even 12 (Thibault).|$|R
5|$|Fleury was a {{participant}} {{on the second}} season of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation figure skating reality show Battle of <b>the</b> <b>Blades,</b> aired {{in the fall of}} 2010, and was donating his winnings to The Men's Project, a charity that provides support for men abused in childhood. His partner was Jamie Salé and the pair finished 5th.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 Pistorius {{applied to}} run in non-disabled track meets. He was at first accepted, but {{questions}} quickly arose about whether <b>the</b> <b>blades</b> give him an unfair advantage. After initial research showed <b>the</b> <b>blades</b> did provide an advantage, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) changed their rules to ban the use of technical devices that provide an advantage and ruled him ineligible to compete. Pistorius challenged the ruling with additional research and was reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in 2008, meaning that he can continue {{to run in}} non-disabled meets {{as long as he}} uses the equipment that was studied in the research.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the aerodynamic design of <b>the</b> <b>blades,</b> {{the design of a}} complete wind power system must also address the design of the installation's rotor hub, nacelle, tower structure, generator, controls, and foundation.|$|E
50|$|Derschmidt's rotor design {{deliberately}} exaggerates this rotation {{to offset}} the increase and decrease in speed throughout <b>the</b> <b>blade's</b> rotation. At <b>the</b> same point of rotation as <b>the</b> traditional <b>blade</b> above, a Derschmidt rotor has advanced <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> considerably to an angle of about 40 degrees compared to its rest position straight out from the hub. As <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> continues advancing, a linkage swings <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> from 40 degrees forward to 40 degrees rearward, slowing the tip by about 1/2 the rotational speed. This process is reversed as <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> reaches its forward-most position, increasing the speed of <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> as it retreats.|$|R
50|$|When {{viewed from}} <b>the</b> side, <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> {{of a figure}} skate is not flat, but curved slightly, forming an {{arc of a circle}} with a radius of 180-220 cm. This {{curvature}} {{is referred to as the}} rocker of <b>the</b> <b>blade.</b> <b>The</b> sweet spot of <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> is below <b>the</b> ball of the foot. This spot is usually located near the stanchion of <b>the</b> <b>blade,</b> and is <b>the</b> part of <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> where all spins are spun on.|$|R
40|$|We have {{experimentally}} {{investigated the}} influence of the tip clearance between a flat-plate-type blade and a duct surface on the flow characteristics around a single rotating <b>blade.</b> <b>The</b> setting angle of <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> was limited within the range where the leading edge separation did not occur over <b>the</b> whole <b>blade</b> span. <b>The</b> local attack angle of the main flow to <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> became smaller toward the tip; the leading edge separation, however, began near <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> tip. <b>The</b> separated zone gradually extended toward the boss of the rotor as <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> setting angle became larger. This {{is due to the fact}} that the low-energy fluid in the dead flow region of the wake of <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> is accumulated near <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> tip and it causes the leading edge separation there. A typical periodic fluctuation of the wake flow due to Karman vortex shedding from the trailing edge of <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> was observed in the intermediate region of <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> at any time if the reattached main flow did not separate up to the trailing edge on the suction surface of <b>the</b> <b>blade...</b>|$|R
5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} <b>the</b> <b>Blades</b> of Chaos, {{a pair of}} blades {{attached}} to chains that are wrapped around his wrists and forearms. In gameplay, <b>the</b> <b>blades</b> can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. A new weapons mechanic called the World Weapon system allows Kratos to pick up weapons scattered throughout game locations or to take them from defeated foes, and to use these for a limited time. There are five World Weapons (sword, club, javelin, sling, shield) that can be collected randomly, although Kratos may possess only one at any time. When a World Weapon is not equipped, Kratos may punch or kick foes {{as part of the}} new combat system. Another new mechanic is that Kratos can tether enemies, referred to as grappling; he can hold an enemy in place with one blade while he attacks other enemies with the other blade, and he can throw the tethered enemy.|$|E

In gameplay, <b>the</b> <b>blades</b> can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. As the game progresses, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Sun Shield and Gauntlet of Zeus—offering alternative combat options. Kratos only learns three magical abilities, as opposed to four in previous installments, including the Efreet, the Light of Dawn, and Charon's Wrath, giving him {{a variety of ways}} to attack and kill enemies. He acquires the relic Triton's Lance—similar to Poseidon's Trident in God of War— which allows him to breathe underwater; a necessary ability as parts of the game require long periods of time there.|$|E
5|$|Non-disabled sprinters have {{calves and}} ankles that return and amplify the energy {{supplied}} by their hips and knees, while Pistorius compensates with additional work {{because he does}} not have calves and ankles with their associated tendons and muscles. An analysis published by Engineering & Technology magazine estimates that in using <b>the</b> <b>blades,</b> Pistorius must generate twice the power from his gluteal and quadriceps muscles that a normal sprinter would. Other sources also credit core abdominal muscles and a faster arm swing. His trainer estimates that about 85 percent of his power comes from his hips and the rest from his knees. This results in a gait that waddles slightly, as Pistorius swings his upper body to balance the springing action of <b>the</b> <b>blades.</b> <b>The</b> <b>blades</b> compress under his weight, then release as he moves forward, providing forward thrust from the tips as they return to their molded shape. As they spring off, he swings them slightly out to the side and throws them forward for the next stride.|$|E
50|$|Drop {{point is}} a style of knife blade that slopes on the spine of <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> from <b>the</b> handle of the knife {{to the tip of}} <b>the</b> <b>blade.</b> This allows <b>the</b> spine of <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> (where <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> is thicker, and thus stronger) to {{continue}} forward to the tip of <b>the</b> <b>blade.</b> This way <b>the</b> {{point is a}}lso aligned with the center axis of the knife, eliminating any pitch momentum when stabbing.|$|R
2500|$|Blades {{are about}} 3/16inch (...) thick.

This spot is usually located near the stanchion of <b>the</b> <b>blade,</b> and is <b>the</b> part of <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> where all spins are spun on. <b>The</b> <b>blade</b> is also hollow ground; a groove on the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> creates two distinct edges, inside and outside. The inside edge of <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> is on <b>the</b> side closest to the skater; the outside edge of <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> is on <b>the</b> side farthest from the skater. In figure skating, it is always desirable to skate on only one edge of <b>the</b> <b>blade.</b> Skating on both at the same time (which is referred to as a flat) may result in lower skating skills scores. The apparently effortless power and glide across the ice exhibited by elite figure skaters fundamentally derives from efficient use of the edges to generate speed.|$|R

5|$|The Douglas Aircraft Company {{designed}} {{a system that}} would prevent the accidental reversal of propeller blades in-flight. During development of the DC-6, the company installed a system that cut electrical power to the mechanisms which rotated <b>the</b> <b>blades</b> while the airplane was in the air. When there was enough weight on the landing gear (which would only be the case when the aircraft was on the ground), a switch which supplied electrical power to the mechanisms was closedmeaning that when the aircraft touched down <b>the</b> <b>blades</b> could be reversed and thus the airplane could be slowed. When the switch was closed, a red flag would swing into view in the cockpit of the aircraft, warning the crew that <b>the</b> <b>blades</b> could be reversed. Should the switch fail to close upon landing, the flag could be raised manually and electrical power to the mechanisms would be restored. When the aircraft took off, electrical power would be cut to the mechanisms so that the propeller blades could not be inadvertently reversed, and the red flag swung out of sight. Reverse thrust warning lamps, which would have warned the crew if the propellers were reversed, were not fitted on Mainliner Idaho.|$|E
5|$|The {{aerodynamics}} of a {{wind turbine}} are not straightforward. The air flow at <b>the</b> <b>blades</b> {{is not the}} same as the airflow far away from the turbine. The very nature of the way in which energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by the turbine. In addition the aerodynamics of a wind turbine at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields. The shape and dimensions of <b>the</b> <b>blades</b> of the wind turbine are determined by the aerodynamic performance required to efficiently extract energy from the wind, and by the strength required to resist the forces on the blade.|$|E

To gain more information, the player meets the ancient dragon Paarthurnax, {{the leader of the}} Greybeards. Paarthurnax reveals that Alduin was cast into the {{currents}} of time by the use of an Elder Scroll in the hope that he would never reemerge. The player locates the Elder Scroll and uses it to peer through a window in time and learn the shout to combat Alduin. The player battles with Alduin, who then flees to Sovngarde, the Nordic afterlife, to gain strength by devouring the souls of deceased Nords.|$|E

5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation found}} a {{simulated engine failure}} procedure was being conducted, which involved {{a member of the}} crew pulling back the throttle lever for engine No. 4 prior to taking off. Investigators found that if the throttle lever was pulled back too far, it would cause the propeller to reversea feature designed to slow the aircraft upon landing. Once the landing gear was raised, the crew would have to raise a metal flag in the cockpit to bring the propeller blades back into the correct position, since a safety device prevented electric power from operating the rotating mechanism at the roots of <b>the</b> <b>blades</b> unless the aircraft was on the ground or the flag was manually raised. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) concluded one of the flight crew applied full power to No. 4 engine, thinking this would bring the aircraft out of the increasing bank. Because <b>the</b> <b>blades</b> were reversed and the flag was not raised, that increased the reverse thrust from No. 4 engine, causing the DC-6 to spiral out of control. Since the plane was so close to the ground, the suddenness of the bank and dive meant the flight crew had no chance to recover the aircraft before impact.|$|E
