The voyage was long and difficult, Leissègues struggling through winter storms that divided his squadron and inflicted severe damage to his ships.

5|$|DST has mixed {{effects on}} health. In {{societies}} with fixed work schedules it provides more afternoon sunlight for outdoor exercise. It alters sunlight exposure; {{whether this is}} beneficial depends on one's location and daily schedule, as sunlight triggers vitamin D synthesis in the skin, but overexposure can lead to skin cancer. DST may help in depression by causing individuals to rise earlier, but some argue the reverse. The Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation Fighting Blindness, chaired by blind sports magnate Gordon Gund, successfully lobbied in 1985 and 2005 for U.S. DST extensions. DST shifts are associated with higher rates of ischemic stroke in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> after the shift, though not in the week thereafter.|$|E

Delegates called for better-known speakers, such as Altgeld or Bryan, but were granted neither then; the Illinois governor declined, and the Nebraskan, once seated, spent much of his time away from the convention floor at the platform committee meeting at the Palmer House.|$|E

5|$|For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> of the fire, {{the high}} thermal energy made the plume highly buoyant; this, {{together}} with settled weather conditions, allowed the plume {{to rise to}} a great height with little cross-mixing.

By 12 December, it was reported that the smoke cloud had reached northern France; it was expected to arrive in northern Spain by the weekend.|$|E
