5|$|Nels Nelsen (3 June 1894 – 3 June 1943), born Nils Johan Nilsen and {{sometimes}} referred to as Nels Nelson, was a Norwegian-born Canadian ski jumper and later ski jumping organizer. He was among the world's best ski jumpers during the 1920s, and held the world record of 73 meters from 1925 to 1930. Born in Salangen, he moved with his family to Revelstoke, British Columbia, in 1912. Credited with bringing the sport of ski jumping to Canada, he made his debut on the nearby Big Hill in 1915. He competed throughout Canada and the United States, and became Canadian champion five times. Despite holding the world record at the time, he was not allowed to participate in the 1928 Winter Olympics because the officials did not find it suitable for him <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> his way to Switzerland.|$|E
25|$|There {{is greater}} {{indication}} that education in prison helps prevent reincarceration. Many people inside prisons lack education. Dropout rates are seven times greater {{for children in}} impoverished areas than those who come from families of higher incomes. This {{is due to the}} fact that many children in poverty are more likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> and care for family members. People in prisons generally come from poverty creating a continuous cycle of poverty and incarceration.|$|E
25|$|Paul Erdős {{was born}} in Budapest, Austria-Hungary, on 26 March 1913. He was the only {{surviving}} child of Anna and Lajos Erdős (formerly Engländer). His two sisters, aged 3 and 5, both died of scarlet fever {{a few days before}} he was born. His parents were both Jewish mathematics teachers. His fascination with mathematics developed early—he was often left home by himself because his father had been imprisoned in a Siberian gulag, causing his mother <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> long hours to support their household. He taught himself to read through mathematics texts that his parents left around their home. By the age of four, given a person’s age, he could calculate in his head, how many seconds they had lived. Due to his sisters' deaths, he had a close relationship with his mother, with the two of them allegedly sharing the same bed until he left for college.|$|E
50|$|Hank LaValle was a Kingston resident. Born in 1845, he {{came from}} a poor family and worked as a farmhand. His {{childhood}} was difficult due <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> instead of going to school. He read and wrote at a grade four level.|$|R

500|$|According to Morgan, despite garment {{manufacturing}} being a three-trillion-dollar industry, {{the working}} conditions {{in those countries}} are poor. In addition <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in those conditions and live on low salaries, these workers {{have a difficult time}} demanding their rights; Bangladeshi workers in Dhaka may be beaten by their employers while Cambodians are shot by police. In Dhaka, workers must work in hot and chemical-ridden environments and structurally unsound buildings. The film shows the events of the 2013 Savar building collapse when an eight-story commercial building named Rana Plaza collapsed. Just prior <b>to</b> that, workers <b>had</b> been forced into the factory even though a crack was seen in the walls.|$|R
500|$|... 1859 Un ballo in maschera (Verdi). By {{the time}} he came to write Un ballo in maschera, Verdi was rich enough not <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> for a living. This opera ran into trouble with the censors because it {{originally}} dealt with the assassination of a monarch.|$|E
500|$|Incorporating Nixon {{into the}} plot was accidental; Moffat {{wanted to set}} the story during the moon landing and looked up the United States {{president}} during the time. He was initially disappointed that {{it was such a}} [...] "rubbish one" [...] and briefly considered using a generic, unnamed president, such as the one seen in [...] "The Sound of Drums". However, he thought it [...] "didn't feel right for a story partly about real events" [...] and realized it could be fun to use Nixon. He believed there was something [...] "comically awkward" [...] about him, and it would be interesting for the Doctor <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with someone he did not like. The episode makes references to the Watergate scandal and David Frost.|$|E
500|$|Gravel [...] "decided {{to become}} a pioneer in a faraway place," [...] and moved to pre-statehood Alaska in August 1956, without funds or a job, {{looking for a place}} where someone without social or {{political}} connections could be a viable candidate for public office. Alaska's voting age of 19, less than most other states' 21, played a role in his decision, as did its newness and cooler climate. Broke when he arrived, he immediately found work in real estate sales until winter arrived. Gravel then was employed as a brakeman for the Alaska Railroad, working the snow-clearing train on the Anchorage-Fairbanks run. Subsequently, he opened a small real estate brokerage in Anchorage (the Territory of Alaska not requiring a license) and saved enough so as not <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> the railroad again. Gravel joined the Anchorage Unitarian Universalist Fellowship, [...] and continued a sporadic relationship with the movement throughout his life.|$|E

500|$|For To, filming Vengeance {{differed}} from his usual style of filmmaking. [...] While he {{is used to}} improvising his scenes as a director, Vengeance marked the first time that <b>To</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with a complete shooting script since the producers demanded that the story and dialogue already be written. Hallyday was the only actor <b>to</b> <b>have</b> read the script, while Anthony Wong had knowledge of the story. To explained that his purpose was to [...] "keep the actors natural and spontaneous. They don't <b>have</b> time <b>to</b> create something. They're given a situation and they act it right away." [...] After filming was complete, the cast and crew celebrated by having a final dinner at a restaurant located near the Milkyway Image studio, hoping to meet again at the forthcoming Cannes Film Festival.|$|R
500|$|At age 15 {{her cousin}} and {{eventual}} husband started courting her, {{but she was}} too young to be interested in boys and preferred sweets. At age 20, incipient cataracts were discovered when she suffered a major episode of conjunctivitis. After marriage at 21, her husband's wealth made it possible for Calment never <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> They led an active life including fencing, cycling (at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence), tennis, [...] swimming, rollerskating at Alyscamps ("I fell flat on my face"), and playing the piano and making music with friends. In the summer, the couple would stay at Uriage for mountaineering up to the glacier ("Even at 16 I had good legs"). She also went hunting with her husband in the hills of the Provence to shoot rabbits and wild boars. Her husband introduced her to smoking, offering cigarettes after a meal, but it was not her passion. ("After the meal, after just one, I'd had enough of it".) Calment smoked cigarettes from the age of 21 (1896) to 117 (1992). According to one source, she smoked no more than two cigarettes per day and it is not known whether she inhaled, whereas an earlier medical source states that she smoked cigars with her husband before changing to cigarettes more recently.|$|E
2500|$|The first posts using John Titor's {{military}} symbol {{appeared on the}} Time Travel Institute forums on November 2, 2000, under the name TimeTravel_0. At that time the name [...] "John Titor" [...] was not being used. The posts discussed time travel in general, the first one being the [...] "six parts" [...] description of what a time machine would need <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> (see below) and responses to questions about how such a machine would work. Early messages tended to be short.|$|E
2500|$|In 1942, Chavez {{quit school}} in the seventh grade. It would be his final year of formal schooling, {{because he did not}} want his mother <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in the fields. Chavez dropped out to become a {{full-time}} migrant farm worker. [...] In 1946 he joined the United States Navy and served for two years. Chavez had hoped that he would learn skills in the Navy that would help him later when he returned to civilian life. Later, Chavez described his experience in the military as [...] "the two worst years of my life".|$|E
50|$|Although {{women have}} seen an {{increase}} in labor force participation {{in the past few}} decades, that is not necessarily an indication of equality in the labor force. This slow transition for women from unpaid to paid labor {{is a step in the}} right direction, but there is still much to be done in the battle for equal pay, jobs, and treatment. Women, in addition <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> twice as hard in order to get a traditionally male-held job, are then paid less than their male counterparts for doing exactly the same job. Women are seen as a second choice as breadwinner in the home. They are preferred <b>to</b> stay home, <b>work</b> as homemakers, and become dependent on their dominant husbands. This gender role is carried into the workplace, making women secondary priority as employees.|$|R
50|$|Each {{department}} at Kramer Levin, {{according to a}} study of the firm by Chambers Associates, has an assigning partner. There is “no formal rotation through the different sub-practices,” meaning that lawyers at the firm can take choose their direction.

2500|$|Also in 2001 TalkBack {{was sold}} to FremantleMedia in a £62 million deal, which made Fincham {{personally}} a multi-millionaire. Fremantle merged TalkBack with another of its acquisitions, Thames Television, to form the new Talkback Thames production company, of which Fincham became the Chief Executive in February 2003. He remained in this position until he left {{at the beginning of}} 2005, after twenty years at TalkBack and its successor company, claiming he wanted [...] "a new challenge and a new adventure." [...] BBC One controller Lorraine Heggessey's appointment to his old post opened up the vacancy at BBC One, which he in turn applied for and won despite being [...] "rich enough never <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> again".|$|E
2500|$|Labor {{shortages}} in the German war economy became critical especially after German {{defeat in the}} battle of Stalingrad in 1942–1943. This led to the increased use of prisoners as forced labourers in German industries. Following the German invasion and occupation of Polish territory, at least 1.5 million Polish citizens, including teenagers, became labourers in Germany, few by choice. Historian Jan Gross estimates that [...] "no more than 15 per cent" [...] of Polish workers volunteered to go to work in Germany. A total of 2.3 million Polish citizens, including 300,000 POWs, were deported to Germany as forced laborers. They tended <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> longer hours for lower wages than their German counterparts.|$|E

50|$|In 1867, Daly's Distillery, {{was absorbed}} into Cork Distilleries Company (CDC), in an {{amalgamation}} of five Cork distilleries. As {{the smallest of}} the five distilleries, Daly's closed soon after the amalgamation, in 1869. Following its closure, Maurice Murray is known <b>to</b> <b>have</b> continued <b>to</b> <b>work</b> for the CDC at the North Mall Distillery, along with his son Daly Murray.|$|R
40|$|Further studies {{confirm the}} authors' {{previous}} contention that patients {{suffering from the}} post-traumatic syndrome (PTS) do recover from this syndrome and return <b>to</b> full-time <b>work</b> before litigation is settled.

6000|$|The {{stranger}} {{said that}} he had a backache, besides blisters on his hands, and that wheeling a heavy barrow did not agree with him.

50|$|Another {{meeting was}} held at Hirwaun Common where it was {{reported}} that several of the coal-owners had brought in workers from elsewhere to replace those on strike.

Besides, when one came to think of it, the same man couldn't be two red herrings. To show as Mrs. Server's would directly impair his power to show as Lady John's. It would seem, in short, a matter for his patronesses to have out together.|$|E
