5|$|With all of Memorize's secret {{operations}} taken down, Edge presses Nilin to {{find the}} Conception Cube, Memorize's central base, and destroy H3O, the Memorize Central Server. Once there, she encounters her father, Charles Cartier-Wells, {{the creator of the}} Sensens. Upon finding him, she sees that, fuelled by the car accident that injured his wife, he has become lost in a dream of an ideal world free from painful memories, all inspired by the desire to help Nilin forget about the accident. Nilin makes him see the harm his technology causes, and Scylla arrives to convince Charles to help Nilin enter <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Server.</b> Once in the presence of <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Server,</b> it is revealed to Nilin that Edge is a self-aware entity created by the amalgamation of unwanted memories within H3O. Nilin, who unwittingly started Edge with the memories of her unhappy childhood, enters the Server and, at H3O/Edge's will, she destroys him and releases the memories back into the general population. As the memories are released, Nilin remembers Edge's words about the mind being a fortress, and says that Edge died to remind people that memories should not become open to all, and that painful memories should be lived with rather than forcibly removed. She comes to the conclusion that outside her now-restored mind she has a family again and a damaged world to heal.|$|E

End systems may know things like which files are involved, and what their security levels might be. Such information could be carried over a network protocol, but only by adding complexity.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper proposes an {{efficient}} bandwidth allocation algorithm in which higher priority {{is given to}} the videos with higher weights using agent technology. The popularity and weight profile of the videos which is used for efficiently allocating bandwidth is periodically updated by a mobile agent. The proposed approach allocates more bandwidth for higher weight videos [popular videos], reduces the load on <b>the</b> <b>central</b> multimedia <b>server</b> and maximizes the channel utilization between the neighboring proxy <b>servers</b> and <b>the</b> <b>central</b> multimedia <b>server</b> and lowers video rejection ratio. The simulation results prove the reduction of load on <b>central</b> multimedia <b>server</b> by load sharing among the neighboring proxy servers, maximum bandwidth utilization, and more bandwidth allocation for higher weight videos...|$|R
50|$|Napster and eDonkey2000, {{which both}} used a central {{server-based}} model, may {{be classified as}} {{the first generation of}} P2P systems. These systems relied on the operation of <b>the</b> respective <b>central</b> <b>servers,</b> and thus were susceptible to centralized shutdown. The second generation of P2P file sharing encompasses networks like Kazaa, Gnutella and Gnutella2, which are able to operate without any <b>central</b> <b>servers,</b> eliminated <b>the</b> <b>central</b> vulnerability by connecting users remotely to each other.|$|R

The Court of Appeal has however ruled {{in the case of}} Agbaje vs Ambode that the non use of card readers is not a ground to nullify an election. The River State governorship election tribunal nullified the election of Mr Nyesom Wike on October 24, 2015.
