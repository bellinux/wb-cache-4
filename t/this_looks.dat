However, the plant also benefits greatly from this relationship. With the help of their traps and predation, the ants defend the plant from other insects and parasitic plants. Any insect that may kill or eat the plant is quickly captured and killed by the ants, which is also to their own benefit.|$|E

25|$|These {{days there}} is not much disputing that Ixodes holocyclus is the main vector for Rickettsial Spotted Fever (also known as Queensland tick typhus) (causative {{organism}} the bacteria Rickettsia australis) and Flinders Island Spotted Fever (causative organism Rickettsia honei). Rickettsia australis is an obligate, intracellular bacterial parasite that proliferates within the endothelial cells of small blood vessels, causing a vasculitis. Spotted Fever is probably more common than the Lyme-like Disease. Sometimes infection with Rickettsia australis occurs without a rash - there may just be a high fever. Usually (65% of cases) there is a black spot (known as an eschar, usually 2–5mm in diameter) {{at the site of the}} tick bite. <b>This</b> <b>looks</b> like a scab with redness and swelling around it. Usually there is only one eschar unless there has been more than one tick bite. Often lymph glands nearby are enlarged and painful. Fever starts 1–14 days (usually 7–10 days) following the tick bite, followed within a few days by a rash. The rash can look like chicken pox as the spots may contain some fluid. Other symptoms include headache, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, mental confusion, aching muscles and joints. The illness may be more severe in adults and elderly persons. Spotted Fever is diagnosed by two blood tests (IgM and Weil-Felix tests) taken 10 days apart. PCR analysis of skin biopsies is a more recent testing method. The disease runs its course in two weeks or so but can be cured more quickly with antibiotics (tetracyclines). As antibiotic treatment is very effective, many persons feel so well that they do not return to have the second blood sample collected. But this second blood test is important as it is the only way of proving the diagnosis of Spotted Fever. Spotted Fever rarely, if ever, occurs more than once because the body usually becomes immune for life. In rare instances there may be an apparent repeated infection after recovery - it is not known whether this is caused by another strain. It is also presently unknown if chronic infections occur. It is rarely fatal. Australian Spotted Fever was first described in 1946 when 12 soldiers contracted the disease during training exercises in north Queensland - it was at that time known as Queensland Tick Typhus (QTT). Infections generally arise in rural areas, but 10% of reported cases appear to have been acquired in major cities. It is apparently commonly seen in tick collectors in southern Queensland. It mostly occurs during the winter and spring, but can occur at any time in temperate areas.|$|E

Reverb stars Leo Gregory, Eva Birthistle, Margo Stilley, Luke de Woolfson, Stephen Lord, and Neil Newbon. The Guardian noted, [...] "In the end, <b>this</b> <b>looks</b> like just another crass, unimaginative and heavy-handed British horror."

This remainder represents the value of the other factors of production, primarily labor."

The last time I saw it, I actually had {{tears in my eyes}} because I knew where the story was going. It broke my heart a little bit." [...] However, in another interview Watts stated, [...] "I was amazed how honest and real all <b>this</b> <b>looks</b> on screen. These girls look really in love and it was curiously erotic." [...] While Harring was quoted saying, [...] "The love scene just happened in my eyes.

[...] Heather Love agreed somewhat with Harring's perception when she stated that identity in Mulholland Drive is not as important as desire: [...] "who we are does not count for much—what matters instead is what we are about to do, what we want to do." ...|$|E
500|$|The Guardian {{posted a}} number of reviews on its website. Julia Reaside deemed the series a [...] "perfectly cast remake of Swedish-Danish crime hit", and stated that [...] "this {{confirms}} Dillane {{as one of our}} very finest. Such control. Poésy is beautifully chilly, and Joseph Mawle (another cracker) leads an asylum-seeker subplot. It's also really funny." [...] Writing about the finale, Reaside said of Dillane's performance: [...] "If this were on a terrestrial channel, he'd be up for all the awards." [...] On the Karl–Elise partnership, she stated: [...] "I wasn't sure about them as a pairing but was immediately convinced by their uncomfortable chemistry." [...] Having not enjoyed The Bridge, Andrew Anthony called The Tunnel an [...] "attractive proposition", adding that [...] "there's an engaging confidence to the slow revelation of the story. All in all, <b>this</b> <b>looks</b> good." [...] Sam Wollaston was more critical of the series, stating that, while the tone was [...] "atmospheric, intriguing, gripping" [...] and there were strong performances from the lead cast members, The Tunnel was [...] "exactly the same as the (recent) original". [...] Wollaston felt that the only [...] "obvious" [...] difference was that, in the original series, there [...] "was a bridge, this is a tunnel.
