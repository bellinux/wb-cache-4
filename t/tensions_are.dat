When threatened the ring-tailed lemur may jump {{in the air and}} strike out with its short nails and sharp upper canine teeth in a behaviour termed jump fighting. This is extremely rare outside of the breeding season when <b>tensions</b> <b>are</b> high and competition for mates is intense. Other aggressive behaviours include a threat-stare, used to intimidate or start a fight, and a submissive gesture known as pulled-back lips.|$|E

Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) is nosing ahead before a man walks up to Lamb and says that he made the anonymous call from the bridge where Felix Toombs was stabbed. Keith loses the election {{by a margin of}} 51% to 49%. After we learn that Woody Goodman (Steve Guttenberg) has been elected mayor, Dick Casablancas (Ryan Hansen) hits on Gia Goodman (Krysten Ritter). Officers come in and arrest Logan for the murder of Felix Toombs before Veronica goes home and finds Abel Koontz, who is in the latter stages of stomach cancer. He asks her to help him find his daughter, Amelia, who has disappeared, and Veronica agrees. Veronica talks to Amelia's old boyfriend, who has not seen her for a while; Amelia ditched the boyfriend in Europe. Cliff McCormack (Daran Norris) is appointed to be Logan's lawyer before Veronica asks Cliff to call the numbers on the phone cards that Amelia stole under an alias. Cliff tells Logan that he should get a different lawyer. Veronica finds out that Amelia called from Neptune (Veronica's town) the previous week. Logan is placed in a cell with his father, Aaron (Harry Hamlin), who is temporarily being held there before his trial for the murder of Lilly Kane. Logan receives bail, but Weevil and his friends are angry about this fact. Veronica breaks into Clarence Wiedman's (Christopher B. Duncan) office, but he denies any knowledge of the situation.|$|E

40|$|The {{properties}} of acetylcholine (ACh) -, potassium- and caffeine contractures of anterior byssus retractor muscle (ABRM) of Mytilus coruscus Gould were examined under various conditions, {{and the following}} results were obtained. 1) In the presence of 100 mM choline, ACh contracture <b>tension</b> <b>was</b> reduced by about 90 %, while potassium contracture <b>tension</b> <b>was</b> not reduced. Both ACh- and potassium contractures were not affected by tetrodotoxin (TTX, 2 × 10 - 6 g/m?). 2) ACh- and potassium contracture <b>tensions</b> <b>were</b> dependent on the concentration of extracellular Ca++, and were abolished by the removal of extracellular Ca++. The rate of the decrement of potassium contracture tension after the removal of extracellular Ca++ was somewhat larger than that of ACh contracture tension, but the difference between them was not significant. In Ca++ -free artificial sea water (ASW) containing 3 mM EGTA, caffeine contracture <b>tension</b> <b>was</b> not reduced, while caffeine contracture tension of potassium-depolarized ABRM was reduced by about 50 %. 3) ACh- and potassium contracture <b>tensions</b> <b>were</b> reduced by 5 - 20 mM Mn++ with increasing its concentration; both contracture <b>tensions</b> <b>were</b> reduced by about 75 % by 20 mM Mn++. Caffeine contracture <b>tension</b> <b>was</b> not reduced by Mn++, and caffeine contracture tension of potassium-depolarized ABRM was reduced by only about 20 % by 5 - 20 mM Mn++, 4) In the presence of 2 mM procaine, ACh contracture <b>tension</b> <b>was</b> abolished, whereas caffeine- and potassium contracture <b>tensions</b> <b>were</b> reduced by about 50 % and 10 %, respectively. By 10 mM procaine, caffeine contracture <b>tension</b> <b>was</b> abolished, whereas potassium contracture <b>tension</b> <b>was</b> reduced by about 50 %. 5) Caffeine contracture was followed by catch tension. Catch tensions of ACh- and caffeine contrac-tures were not affected by the removal of extracellular Ca++. These catch <b>tensions</b> <b>were</b> released by the application of high concentration of potassium, with a transient increment of tension. In potassium depolarized ABRM, ACh contracture was abolished while caffeine contracture was induced with a phasic time course. In Na+ -free ASW, caffeine contracture <b>was</b> phasic. Catch <b>tension</b> of ACh contracture was released by the removal of extracellular Na+ and by an addition of 10 mM procaine. On {{the basis of these}} results, the mechanism of excitation-contraction coupling and catch of ABRM were discussed...|$|R

As in Casino Royale, the concept of the loss of British power and influence during the post-Second World War and Cold War period was also present in the novel. The journalist William Cook observes that, with the British Empire in decline [...] "Bond pandered to Britain's inflated and increasingly insecure self-image, flattering us with the fantasy that Britannia could still punch above her weight." [...] Woollacott and Bennett agree, and maintain that [...] "Bond embodied the imaginary possibility that England might once again be placed at the centre of world affairs during a period when its world power status was visibly and rapidly declining." [...] In From Russia, with Love, this acknowledgement of decline manifested itself in Bond's conversations with Darko Kerim when he admits that in England [...] "we don't show teeth any more—only gums." ...|$|E

500|$|McKenzie {{wrote that}} Tripp only {{partially}} succeeded in {{his goal of}} describing homosexuality, that his bibliography omitted basic works and included some dubious sources, and that while some of Tripp's observations were thought-provoking, others were ludicrous. He also described the book as a rambling, awkwardly written, and poorly organized anecdotal survey. Hendin called The Homosexual Matrix pseudoscience and Tripp an [...] "erudite con man" [...] who lacked impartiality and had a [...] "bias toward homosexuality". Hendin argued that Tripp saw homosexuality as superior to heterosexuality and sexual passion as dependent upon anger, mistakenly drew conclusions about heterosexuality from observations about homosexual behavior, and had a distorted view of sexual history and a negative view of women. Hendin wrote that Tripp's conclusion that homosexuality {{is not related to}} fear or anger toward women, family relationships, or a reflection of confusion over sexual identity, was baseless. His review was followed by letters of protest from the historian Martin Duberman, Pomeroy, Weinberg, and others, to which Hendin replied with a rebuttal. Cameron called Tripp [...] "vulgar" [...] and prejudiced and characterizing Tripp's evidence as [...] "largely literary." [...] Cameron criticized Tripp for treating the Kinsey Reports as authoritative, writing that they had been [...] "critically studied for almost thirty years" [...] and were out of date, for being careless in his discussion of history, and for focusing mainly on male homosexuality and neglecting lesbianism. Cameron was convinced by Tripp's argument that strains and <b>tensions</b> <b>are</b> necessary in a relationship to keep the partners interested in each other, and found his discussion of psychotherapy insightful.|$|E

Being loyal to one team in a rivalry brings a sense of belonging to a community of supporters that are hoping that the team they are rooting for wins. The fans of the two different teams do not sit next to each other because this disrupts the community. In a similar way, competition displays an indirect way of fighting. Society does not condone direct fighting as a way of getting something so this is the most passive aggressive way of fighting.
