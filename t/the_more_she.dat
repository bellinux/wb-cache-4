Army investigators found 14 to 15 pages of encrypted chats, in unallocated space on her MacBook's hard drive, between Manning and someone believed to be Assange. She wrote {{in a statement that}} <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>she</b> had tried to fit in at work, the more alienated she became from everyone around her. The relationship with WikiLeaks had given her a brief respite from the isolation and anxiety.|$|E

25|$|According to Thomas Powers, {{the author}} of Diana: The Making of a Terrorist, the more Oughton learned about the hard life of rural Guatemala, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>she</b> {{reflected}} on the affluence of the United States. In Chichicastenango, Americans seemed an alien presence; the fact of their wealth was almost {{an insult to the}} impoverished Indians. In her mind, confusion emerged that lasted the rest of her life: she had rejected affluence (at first almost unconsciously) to work among the poor, but poverty, clearly, was nothing to be envied. She hated poverty, but she hated affluence, too. Oughton left Chichicastenango with a new view of the problems that undeveloped countries like Guatemala faced when in struggle with the United States.|$|E

25|$|Chimène {{is alone}} in {{a room in the}} palace and is torn apart by {{conflicting}} emotions: love, desire for revenge and honour. But she vows to avenge her father (Scene 1). The king enters and tries to console Chimène, treating her as his own daughter: he declares how fond he was of her dead father, but also reveals the respect in which everyone holds Rodrigue, the one man capable of leading the fight against the Moors. Nevertheless, the king promises to capture and punish her father's killer (Scene 2). Left alone with her maids, Chimène reveals her undying love for Rodrigue. She adored him before the fatal duel, and now that fate has divided them and all hope is dead, their love still remains intact. Nevertheless, she says she will do what honour demands, and <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>she</b> loves Rodrigue, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>she</b> will seek to punish him (Scene 3). The next scene is taken up by a dramatic duet between Chimène and Rodrigue, who has just arrived: he begs her to kill him, but she fails to follow through with her vow of revenge, and the two are left in despair (Scene 4). Alone again, Rodrigue contemplates death (Scene 5), until he is met by his father and his followers, and asked to march against the army of the Moors which has just laid siege to the city. If he is to die, he should do so nobly for his king and country. Encouraged by his father's words, Rodrigue agrees to fight and the first act ends with a martial chorus (Scene 6).|$|E
500|$|Fraser and Navarro {{write that}} {{toward the end}} of her life, Evita was working as many as 20 to 22 hours per day in her foundation, often {{ignoring}} her husband's request that she cut back on her workload and take the weekends off. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>she</b> worked with the poor in her foundation, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>she</b> adopted an outraged attitude toward the existence of poverty, saying, [...] "Sometimes I have wished my insults were slaps or lashes. I've wanted to hit people in the face to make them see, if only for a day, what I see each day I help the people." [...] Crassweller writes that Evita became fanatical about her work in the foundation and felt on a crusade against the very concept and existence of poverty and social ills. [...] "It is not surprising", writes Crassweller, [...] "that as her public crusades and her private adorations took on a narrowing intensity after 1946, they simultaneously veered toward the transcendental." [...] Crassweller compares Evita to Ignatius Loyola, saying she came to be akin to a one-woman Jesuit Order.|$|E
500|$|Joseph and Prince Kaunitz {{arranged}} the First Partition of Poland despite Maria Theresa's protestations. Her {{sense of justice}} pushed her to reject the idea of partition, which would hurt the Polish people. The duo {{argued that it was}} too late to abort now. Besides, Maria Theresa herself agreed with the partition when she realised that Frederick II of Prussia and Catherine II of Russia would do it with or without Austrian participation. Maria Theresa claimed and eventually took Galicia and Lodomeria, a province claimed by Hungarian monarchs since the 13thcentury; in the words of Frederick, [...] "the more she cried, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>she</b> took".|$|E

500|$|Regarding Bell's {{influence}} on Anna, director Chris Buck said her personality {{was just so}} fun and energetic. [...] "We had an Anna character but Kristen really came in and pushed it and made it even funnier and even sweeter I think, and more believable as a three-dimensional character," [...] he said. He also admitted that he [...] "fell in love with 's voice and 's spirit". Director Jennifer Lee said that she loved Bell because the actress shared a similarity with her, that girls could be funny. [...] "So she was a fantastic collaborator," [...] Lee added.

500|$|Upon its release, {{the music}} video for [...] "Ego" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics who noted similarities {{with the one}} for [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". A writer of Rap-Up magazine described the video as [...] "Single Ladies (Part 2)". Tracey Ford of AOL described the video as [...] "an ode to multiple personalities, leotards and all things 'diva.'" [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy commented that the video would divide critics' opinions whether it is [...] "a sexy, burlesque-inspired variation on the theme [...] established {{in the other two}} videos from the Sasha Fierce side of the album, or just a 'Single Ladies' retread with more crotch and rump". Leah Greenblatt of the magazine Entertainment Weekly gave a negative review for the video, saying that it was very similar to the one for [...] "Single Ladies" [...] noting [...] " [...] 'Ego' feels an awful like the (admittedly awesome) 'Single Ladies' with a spiral perm." [...] Tamar Anitai of MTV was also negative towards the video for the song, writing that it looks like a dress rehearsal of the video for [...] "Single Ladies" [...] but [...] "in drag". She further wrote, [...] "Anyway, while the '80s horns-and-organ vibe delivers some throwback flavor, I'm not feeling the circa-2002-Christina-Aguilera curly wig or the satin prom gloves. And the boob grabbing is a little too gratuitous. And when Beyonce says 'It's too big, it's too wide, it's too strong, it won't fit, it's too much,' I'm not even positive that she's really referring to an ego." [...] Nadia Mendoza of The Sun noted that Beyoncé's appeal is [...] "fast disppearing <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>she</b> morphs into alter ego Sasha Fierce" [...] further describing the dance moves in the video as [...] "bizarre". She finished her review by writing, [...] " [...] warbles along to her track while shaking her booty in a not very flattering leotard in a similar vein to the iconic Single Ladies vid. But unfortunately for her, Ego is not half as catchy." ...|$|E

Although she does not fully trust Magneto or agree with his methods, she remains with him for the sake of finding out if there is any trace of Warren left inside of Archangel. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>she</b> probes Archangel's blank mind in order to find out what is wrong with him, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>she</b> begins to worry that his Dark Angel persona may resurface as she begins to see visions of destruction in his head.

After following him around town, she and Magneto end up caught in a trap created by the Clan Akkaba who seek to create clones of Archangel.

On July 12, 2006, Harris's campaign spokesman Chris Christopher Ingram left the campaign.
