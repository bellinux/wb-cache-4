The characteristics of human papillomavirus-positive and human papillomavirus-negative husbands were compared using odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals. Thirteen per cent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>husbands</b> <b>of</b> control women, 18 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>husbands</b> <b>of</b> women with invasive cervical carcinoma, and 21 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>husbands</b> <b>of</b> in situ cervical carcinoma women were positive for penile human papillomavirus DNA. Human papillomavirus 16 was detected in 45 husbands, human papillomavirus 18, 31 or 33 in 19, and human papillomavirus 6 / 11 in 6, {{but the majority of}} human papillomavirus infection (158) was with other or unspecified human papillomavirus types. The same human papillomavirus type was seldom identified in both <b>husband</b> and wife. <b>The</b> strongest variation in penile human papillomavirus infection was by country, with percentages among <b>the</b> <b>husbands</b> <b>of</b> control women ranging between 3 % in Spain and 39 % in Brazil.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that anti-HLA antibodies might be involved in the pathogenesis of herpes gestationis (HG). Accordingly, we have studied the frequency and specificity of such antibodies in 26 female patients with immunologically proven HG. In addition, to further investigate the potential association <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>husband's</b> antigens in <b>the</b> development of this disorder, we have performed HLA typing in 20 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>husbands</b> <b>of</b> these women. HLA-DR 2 was found in 50 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>husbands</b> (controls 25 %, p = 0. 04). The increase was more pronounced in <b>the</b> <b>husbands</b> <b>of</b> patients with <b>the</b> HLA-DR 3, DR 4 combination (64 %, p <. 01) than in <b>the</b> <b>husbands</b> <b>of</b> those with other antigen combinations. Anti-HLA antibodies were found in 85 % of women with a history of HG. Approximately 25 % of normal, multiparous women have such antibodies in their sera. In normal women, their presence has not been associated with increased fetal or maternal risk. These data suggest that <b>the</b> <b>husband's</b> HLA type may be associated with the development of HG in the wife. Anti-HLA antibodies are present in most patients, but their significance remains uncertain...|$|R

5|$|Blérancourt's {{traditional}} {{power structure}} was reshaped {{by the events}} of 1789. The notary Gellé, previously an undisputed town leader, was challenged by a group of reformists who were led by several of Saint-Just's friends, including <b>the</b> <b>husband</b> <b>of</b> his sister Louise. Their attempts were not successful until 1790 when Blérancourt held its first open municipal elections. Mandated by the National Constituent Assembly, the new electoral structure allowed Saint-Just's friends to assume authority in the village as mayor, secretary, and, in the case of his brother-in-law, head of the local National Guard. The jobless Saint-Just, despite not meeting the legal age and tax qualifications, was allowed to join the Guard.|$|E
5|$|Case No. 5 were {{light bulbs}} that {{represented}} {{the state of}} the art of filament lamps from 1900 to 1913. They show electric lights using certain gases within the sealed bulb. They were directing a path of technology into 'cold light.' One of these was a long tube instead of a globe. It had a stop cock in the center and a glass bulb at each end. Hammer explained how this one came about. He said one day in 1902 he visited Pierre Curie, <b>the</b> <b>husband</b> <b>of</b> Madam Curie. Professor Curie drew a diagram on the blackboard and suggested that Hammer make a lamp like that with sulfide of zinc inside. Curie explained to Hammer what radium gaseous could do in this configuration. It would stimulate luminescence that would produce light without a hot filament involved.|$|E
