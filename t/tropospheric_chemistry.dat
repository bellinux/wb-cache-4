It is shown that the first systematic enhancement over the natural levels of the above species occurred between 1875 and 1900 and that the natural, continental sulfur emissions have been significantly overestimated with respect to biogenic and underestimated with respect to terrigenic sources. Over the last 20 years sulphate and heavy metals clearly decline whereas the ammonium and nitrate trend is levelled off or continuous to increase, respectively. The Monte Rosa ice core records are found to be representative for the summer half year reflecting at least, on the inter-regional spatial scale the anthropogenic change of the high Alpine snow chemistry.

Shortly after joining Caltech, he became {{intrigued}} with Los Angeles's historic smog, which, at that time, was near record highs. Caltech biology professor Ari Haagen-Smit had, {{in the early}} 1950s, surmised that ozone, the principal gaseous component of smog, results from reactions involving volatile hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Seinfeld realized that modeling the formation of smog over an urban area like Los Angeles would involve describing mathematically the three-dimensional transport, mixing, and chemical reactions in the atmosphere. A key component was describing the chemistry of the sunlight-driven hydrocarbon - NOx system. At the time of Haagen-Smit's classic papers, the actual mechanism of the underlying chemistry was unknown. The essential role of the hydroxyl (OH) radical in <b>tropospheric</b> <b>chemistry</b> was not established until about 1970. Seinfeld and his group formulated a chemical mechanism for ozone formation and in 1973 developed the first urban-scale atmospheric chemical-transport model, which {{was applied to the}} Los Angeles basin. This work, published in three papers in the journal, Atmospheric Environment, initiated what emerged as an entire field of scientific endeavor devoted to the modeling of tropospheric pollution. Although he continued to conduct research on optimization for several years, in the early 1970s he formed a major research group on atmospheric chemistry, aerosols, and atmospheric modeling.

Another component in NASA's effort are satellite projects for exploration of <b>tropospheric</b> <b>chemistry</b> and dynamics. A unique data product is the Tropospheric Ozone Residual (TOR) utilizing global tropospheric ozone data. Another key research tool are simulation studies of atmospheric chemistry and dynamics for the theoretical understanding of the atmosphere, the extrapolation of observed trends, and for sensitivity studies assessing a changing anthropogenic impact to air chemistry and climate.

40|$|A major task in many {{applications}} of atmospheric chemistry transport problems is the numerical integration of stiff systems of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) describing the chemical transformations. A faster solver that {{is easier to}} couple to the other physics in the problem is still needed. The integration method, α-QSS, corresponding to the solver CHEMEQ 2 aims at meeting {{the demands of a}} process-split, reacting-flow simulation (Mott 2000; Mott and Oran, 2001). However, this integrator has yet to be applied to the numerical integration of kinetic equations in <b>tropospheric</b> <b>chemistry.</b> A zero-dimensional (box) model is developed to test how well CHEMEQ 2 works on the <b>tropospheric</b> <b>chemistry</b> equations. This paper presents the testing results. The reference chemical mechanisms herein used are Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Mechanism (RACM) (Stockwell et al., 1997) and its secondary lumped successor Regional Lumped Atmospheric Chemical Scheme (ReLACS) (Crassier et al., 2000). The box model is forced and initialized by the DRY scenarios of Protocol Ver. 2 developed by EUROTRAC (Poppe et al., 2001). The accuracy of CHEMEQ 2 is evaluated by comparing the results to solutions obtained with VODE. This comparison is made with parameters of the error tolerance, relative difference with respect to VODE scheme, trade off between accuracy and efficiency, global time step for integration etc. The study based on the comparison concludes that the single-point α-QSS approach is fast and moderately accurate as well as easy to couple to reacting flow simulation models, which makes CHEMEQ 2 one of the best candidates for three-dimensional atmospheric Chemistry Transport Modelling (CTM) studies. In addition the RACM mechanism may be replaced by ReLACS mechanism for <b>tropospheric</b> <b>chemistry</b> transport modelling. The testing results also imply that the accuracy for chemistry numerical simulations is highly different from species to species. Therefore ozone is not the good choice for testing numerical ODE solvers or for evaluation of mechanisms because current <b>tropospheric</b> <b>chemistry</b> mechanisms are mainly designed for troposphere ozone prediction...|$|E
