5|$|Kotzer {{estimated}} that a frontal assault against the Egyptians would be useless, {{as they were}} dug in {{on both sides of}} the pillbox. In complete darkness, the 1st Company made its way south through the wadi hoping to avoid enemy fire from superior positions and weapons until they were close enough to respond. At 03:00, the Israeli artillery barrage started, but did not do significant damage and only alerted all Egyptian positions to the Israeli presence. The only Israeli unit close to engagement at the time was Kotzer's company. About 100 m away from the Egyptian defense line, <b>they</b> <b>stepped</b> into an ambush and the leading squad was eliminated. Kotzer ordered the machine gunners to climb to the east bank of the wadi to provide cover for a counterattack, and this move also led to Israeli casualties. The counterattack was difficult and only destroyed some small Egyptian entrenchments.|$|E

In 1965, Đồng Xoài was a district town situated at a road junction which connected Inter-Inter-Provisional Road 13, National Highway 1 and Highway 14. The district was defended by 200 local Vietnamese soldiers drawn from the 327th and 328th Militia Companies, and the 111th Regional Force Company. They were supported by one armoured squadron (6 armoured vehicles) and two 105mm howitzers. There were also 200 Cambodian soldiers of a Civilian Irregular Defense Group, 11 United States Army Special Forces personnel, and nine U.S. Navy Seabees. Prior to the battle, the U.S Special Forces had assumed control of Đồng Xoài's defences; <b>they</b> <b>stepped</b> up guard and patrol activities, and ordered {{the construction of new}} defensive fortifications around the district headquarters, the Special Forces Camp, and the armoured and artillery positions on {{the eastern side of the}} district.|$|E

25|$|In June 1846, Frémont and Carson both {{participated in}} a California {{uprising}} against Mexico called the Bear Flag Revolt. Mexico ordered all Americans to leave California. They {{did not want to}} go, and declared California an independent republic. American settlers in California wanted to be free of the Mexican government. The Americans found courage to oppose Mexico because they had Frémont and his troops behind them. Frémont wrote an oath of allegiance. He and his men were able to give some protection to the Americans. He ordered Carson to execute an old Mexican man named Jose De La Reyes Berryessa and his two adult nephews. These three were captured when <b>they</b> <b>stepped</b> ashore at San Francisco Bay. They were executed to keep them from taking reports to Mexico about the uprising.|$|E

25|$|When Stevenson {{heard the}} {{fighting}} between Walthall and Geary, he ordered Pettus to take three regiments {{from the summit}} to assist Jackson. By this time, Moore's Alabamians were moving up amidst Walthall's retreating men, and they fired on Ireland's New Yorkers from 100 yards. Unable to see {{the size of the}} force resisting it through the fog, the Union men retreated beyond a stone wall. Moore's 1,000 men took positions in the rifle pits facing the wall and waited for the inevitable counterattack. Ireland's men were too exhausted to make an immediate move. As Whitaker's brigade arrived after 1 p.m., <b>they</b> <b>stepped</b> over Ireland's men and rushed into the attack. Candy's brigade was moving up the mountain side on Whitaker's left, followed by the brigades of Woods and Grose.

25|$|Not {{long after}} the assault on Culp's Hill began, as dusk fell around 7:30p.m., Ewell sent two brigades from the {{division}} of Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early against East Cemetery Hill from the east, and he alerted the division of Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes to prepare a follow-up assault against Cemetery Hill proper from the northwest. The two brigades from Early's division were commanded by Brig. Gen. Harry T. Hays: his own Louisiana Tigers Brigade and Hoke's Brigade, the latter commanded by Col. Isaac E. Avery. <b>They</b> <b>stepped</b> off from a line parallel to Winebrenner's Run, a narrow tributary of Rock Creek to the southeast of town. Hays commanded five Louisiana regiments, which together numbered only about 1,200 officers and men. Avery had three North Carolina regiments totaling 900. The brigade of Brig. Gen. John B. Gordon was in support behind Hays and Avery but {{did not participate in}} the fighting.|$|E
25|$|From 1881 to 1882, some 30 Jewish {{families}} left Sana'a {{and several}} nearby settlements, {{and made the}} long trek by foot and by sea to Jerusalem, where most had settled in Silwan. This wave was followed by other Jews from central Yemen, who continued to move into British-ruled Palestine until 1914. The majority of these groups would later move into Jerusalem proper and Jaffa. Rabbi Avraham Al-Naddaf, who immigrated to Jerusalem in 1891, described in his autobiography the hardships the Yemenite Jewish community faced in their new country, {{where there were no}} hostelries to accommodate wayfarers and new immigrants. On the other hand, he writes that the Sephardi kollelim (seminaries) had taken under their auspices the Yemenite Jews from the moment <b>they</b> <b>stepped</b> foot in Jerusalem. Later, however, the Yemenites would come to feel discriminated against by the Sephardic community, who compelled them to no longer make use of their own soft, pliable matzah, but to buy from them only the hard cracker-like matzah made weeks in advance prior to Passover. He also mentions that the Yemenite community would pay the prescribed tax to the public coffers; yet, they were not being allotted an equal share or subsidy as had been given to the Sephardic Jews. By 1910, the Yemenites had broken away from the Sephardic seminaries.|$|E

Proceeding {{on to the}} Sunda Strait, which was reached mid-morning on 21 January and the men were then {{transferred}} {{to a number of}} smaller, faster Dutch ships to run the gauntlet of Japanese bombers that were attacking Allied shipping in the area. In concert with several Australian, British and Indian escorts and two Dutch Catalina flying boats, the convoy entered Keppel Harbour on 25 January 1942. Upon arrival in Singapore, consisting of 942 personnel of all ranks, the battalion was allocated to the task of preparing machine gun positions on Singapore's north coast and around the naval base. <b>They</b> <b>stepped</b> into a maelstrom, the Japanese were bombing the naval base—where the 2/4th were accommodated—every day and the fighting on the Malay Peninsula was all but over.

Covering the withdrawal, the 22nd Brigade was the last Australian unit to cross the [...] wide Causeway before it was blown up, early on the morning of 31 January, to prevent the Japanese from capturing it and to slow their advance.|$|E
500|$|As they {{considered}} their previous effort a [...] "rush job" [...] {{to capitalize on}} their sudden success, the duo spent more time crafting the follow-up. It {{was the first time}} Simon insisted on total control in aspects of recording. Work began in 1966 and took nine months. [...] Garfunkel considered the recording of [...] "Scarborough Fair" [...] to be the point at which <b>they</b> <b>stepped</b> into the role of producer, as they were constantly beside engineer Roy Halee mixing the track. Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme was issued in October 1966, following the release of several singles and receiving sold-out college campus shows. The duo resumed their trek on the college circuit eleven days following the release, crafting an image that was described as [...] "alienated", [...] "weird", and [...] "poetic". Manager Mort Lewis also was responsible for this public perception, as he withheld them from television appearances (unless they were allowed to play an uninterrupted set or choose the setlist). Simon, then 26, felt he had finally [...] "made it" [...] into an upper echelon of rock and roll, while most importantly retaining artistic integrity ("making him spiritually closer to Bob Dylan than to, say, Bobby Darin", wrote biographer Marc Eliot). The duo chose William Morris as their booking agency after a recommendation from Wally Amos, a mutual friend through their producer Tom Wilson.|$|E

This was the Honda A-Type, nicknamed the Bata Bata for the sound the engine made. In 1949, the Honda Technical Research Institute was liquidated for 1,000,000, or about 5,000 today; these funds were used to incorporate Honda Motor Co., Ltd.
