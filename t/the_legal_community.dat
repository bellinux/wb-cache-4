[...] The church's relationship with government and <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>community</b> began when the colony was under military government and the Church of England was the established church.

500|$|Bohlen dwelt heavily upon Cardozo's {{opinion in}} Palsgraf in {{presenting}} the Tentative Draft of the Restatement to the ALI's annual meeting, which approved the section citing Palsgraf with little discussion.

According to Kaufman, [...] "the bizarre facts, Cardozo's spin on the legal issue, the case's timing {{in relation to the}} Restatement project, its adaptability for law-school teaching, the policy-oriented dissent by Andrews, Cardozo's rhetoric, and Cardozo's name—all these factors combined to make Palsgraf a legal landmark." [...] According to Prosser, writing in his hornbook for law students, [...] "what the Palsgraf case actually did was submit to the nation's most excellent state court a law professor's dream of an examination question". But Professor (later Judge) John T. Noonan saw more than this, noting that Cardozo was then the nation's most prominent state-court judge: [...] "The excitement of Palsgraf was not merely that it was a brilliant examination question; it was an examination question answered by Cardozo." ...|$|E
