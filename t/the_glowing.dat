40|$|Glow plugs {{are widely}} used to promote the desired cold start and post-cold start {{combustion}} characteristics of light duty diesel engines. The importance of <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> plug becomes more apparent when the compression ratio is low. An experimental investigation of combustion initiation and development aided by <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> plug {{has been carried out}} on a single cylinder HPCR DI diesel engine with a low compression ratio of 15. 5 : 1. High speed imaging of combustion initiated by <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> plug in a combustion bomb has been used to add understanding of initiation process. Complementary CFD studies have been carried out using ANSYS Fluent 14. 0 to explore the interactions between <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> plug and <b>the</b> spray behavior. Observation of successful combustion initiation show that two conditions must be met, compression heating and heat transfer from <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> plug must raise temperature of gas nearby to at least 413 ºC and the vapour/air equivalence ratio no lower than 0. 15 - 0. 35. The initiation site was at spray edge close to <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> plug, <b>the</b> flame grew locally before expanding downstream in direction of spray penetration {{after the end of the}} main injection. Experimental studies carried out on the engine indicated that the engine IMEP, heat release and combustion stability were continuously improved by using <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> plug at ambient temperatures higher than the temperature requiring <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> plug for initiation of combustion. A rapid development of premixed combustion was achieved associated with improved engine work output, heat release rate and cycle-by-cycle stability. The premixed combustion was enhanced by strengthening spray vaporization through <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> plug. In this study, the combustion behavior was enhanced by <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> plug up to ambient temperature of 20 ºC. Initiation delay was shortened by a rapid development of combustion aided by <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> plug. An initiation delay model was developed to account for both physical part (transport delay) and chemical part (chemical delay). The transport delay (ms) is equivalent to the time for spray to transport to the vicinity of <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> plug, dictated by parameters including S, distance between <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> plug tip and the injector tip (mm) ...|$|R

5|$|Bioluminescence {{is used by}} {{a variety}} of animals to mimic other species. Many species of deep sea fish such as the {{anglerfish}} and dragonfish make use of aggressive mimicry to attract prey. They have an appendage on their heads called an esca that contains bioluminescent bacteria able to produce a long-lasting glow which the fish can control. <b>The</b> <b>glowing</b> esca is dangled or waved about to lure small animals to within striking distance of the fish.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the Commercial Import Program (CIP) {{appeared}} to be working successfully and North Vietnam had not decided to attack the South after Diệm had canceled the planned 1956 reunification elections. <b>The</b> <b>glowing</b> press coverage of the period contrasted {{to that of the}} later decades of the 1960s and 1970s, in which the American media engaged in investigative journalism that undermined the official line presented by Washington in relation to Vietnam. This was particularly true during Diệm's downfall in 1963. Journalists such as David Halberstam, Malcolm Browne and Neil Sheehan all won Pulitzer Prizes for their work on the Buddhist crisis, in which mass protests erupted after years of discrimination against the Buddhist majority.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the writers}} who most enchanted Hańska was the French novelist Honoré de Balzac. After laboring in pseudonymous obscurity for ten years, Balzac {{published}} Les Chouans (The Chouans) in 1829.

Hańska was intrigued by <b>the</b> <b>glowing</b> portrayal of the female protagonist, driven by true love to protect the object of her desire. She also enjoyed Balzac's Physiologie du mariage (The Physiology of Marriage), also published in 1829, which heaps satirical scorn on husbands and celebrates the virtue of married women.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>glow</b> plugs used {{in model}} engines are {{significantly}} different from those used in full-size diesel engines. In full-size engines, <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> plug is used only for starting. In model engines, <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> plug {{is an integral part}} of the ignition system because of the catalytic effect of the platinum wire. <b>The</b> <b>glow</b> plug is a durable, mostly platinum, helical wire filament recessed into the plug's tip. When an electric current runs through the plug, or when exposed to the heat of the combustion chamber, <b>the</b> filament <b>glows,</b> enabling it to help ignite the special fuel used by these engines. Power can be applied using a special connector attaching to the outside of the engine, and may use a rechargeable battery or DC power source.|$|R

5|$|Set {{apart from}} <b>the</b> <b>glowing</b> underside, the darker, nonluminescent collar tapers at {{both sides of}} the throat, and has been {{hypothesized}} to serve as a lure by mimicking the silhouette of a small fish from below. The appeal of the lure would be multiplied in a school of sharks. If the collar does function in this way, the cookiecutter shark would be the only known case of bioluminescence in which the absence of light attracts prey, while its photophores serve to prevent premature detection by incoming would-be predators. As the shark can only match a limited range of light intensities, its vertical movements likely serve to preserve the effectiveness of its disguise across various times of day and weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|Even though Salomy Jane didn't {{return a}} profit (likely due to second-string {{distribution}} channels), its favorable reception convinced Middleton {{that his wife}} could challenge the world's top movie star, Mary Pickford. Every CMPC movie was from that time forward {{intended to be a}} star vehicle for Michelena. Unfortunately, Michelena's ego expanded with <b>the</b> <b>glowing</b> reviews of her skill, and her demands for star treatment brought heavier expenses to productions that continued to lose money. Mignon, The Lily of Poverty Flat, A Phyllis of the Sierras, Salvation Nell and The Rose of the Misty Pool all failed to turn a profit, and a lavish production of Faust which was in production in 1915 was given {{until the end of the}} year to be completed. Faust wasn't done by January 1916, and CMPC president Herbert Payne shut the film company down and filed for bankruptcy. Faust was never released.|$|E
5|$|Radioisotopes of caesium {{require special}} precautions: the {{improper}} handling of caesium-137 gamma ray sources {{can lead to}} release of this radioisotope and radiation injuries. Perhaps the best-known case is the Goiânia accident of 1987, in which an improperly-disposed-of radiation therapy system from an abandoned clinic {{in the city of}} Goiânia, Brazil, was scavenged from a junkyard, and <b>the</b> <b>glowing</b> caesium salt sold to curious, uneducated buyers. This led to four deaths and serious injuries from radiation exposure. Together with caesium-134, iodine-131, and strontium-90, caesium-137 was among the isotopes distributed by the Chernobyl disaster which constitute the greatest risk to health. Radioisotopes of francium would presumably be dangerous as well due to their high decay energy and short half-life, but none have been produced in large enough amounts to pose any serious risk.|$|E

5|$|In the Holy Roman Empire (and {{elsewhere}} in Central/Eastern Europe), women who killed their newborn could be {{liable to be}} placed in an open grave, and have a stake hammered into their heart. A detailed description of an execution in this manner comes from 17th century Košice (then in Hungary, now in eastern Slovakia). A woman to be executed for infanticide involved an executioner and two assistants to help him. First, a grave some one-and-a-half ell deep was dug. The woman was placed within it, her hands and feet secured by driving nails through them. The executioner placed a small thorn bush upon her face. He then placed, and held vertically, a wooden stave at her heart to mark its location, while his assistants piled earth on the woman, keeping her head free of earth {{at the behest of the}} clerics, however, as to do otherwise would have quickened the death process. Once the earth had been piled upon her, the executioner grabbed with a pair of tongs a rod made of iron, which had been made red hot. He positioned <b>the</b> <b>glowing</b> iron rod beside the wooden stave, and as one of his assistants hammered the rod in, the other assistant emptied a trough of earth upon the woman's head. It is said that a scream was heard, and that the earth actually moved upwards for a moment, before all was over.|$|E
