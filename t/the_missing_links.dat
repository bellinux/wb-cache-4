25|$|In 1966, Kath {{joined a}} cover band called <b>the</b> <b>Missing</b> <b>Links,</b> taking Parazaider and Seraphine with him, and started playing clubs and ballrooms in Chicago {{on a regular}} basis. Parazaider's friend at De Paul University, trumpeter Lee Loughnane, also sat in with the band from time to time. Kath's compatriot, James William Guercio (who later became Chicago's producer) was lead guitarist {{in one of two}} road bands {{performing}} on The Dick Clark Show with <b>the</b> <b>Missing</b> <b>Links.</b> Kath received an offer from Guercio to play bass for the Illinois Speed Press and move to Los Angeles, but declined as he considered the guitar his main instrument and wanted to sing lead. He stayed with Parazaider, Seraphine, and Loughnane instead, who quickly recruited trombonist James Pankow from De Paul and vocalist/keyboardist Robert Lamm. Kath sang the lower range of lead vocals in the group in a style reminiscent of Ray Charles. The group practiced at Parazaider's parents' basement and changed its name to The Big Thing. With the addition of singer and bassist Peter Cetera of The Exceptions, they moved to Los Angeles and signed with Columbia Records, renaming the band Chicago Transit Authority. In mid-1969, the name was shortened to Chicago.|$|E
25|$|The Saints' {{original}} {{members were}} Brisbane schoolmates Chris Bailey (singer-songwriter, later guitarist), Ed Kuepper (guitarist-songwriter), and Ivor Hay (drummer). They had formed Kid Galahad and the Eternals in 1973 with Irish-raised Bailey on vocals, Hay on piano and German-born Kuepper on guitar. Their musical inspirations came from 1950s rock 'n' roll musicians such as Little Richard and Elvis Presley (their name referenced his 1962 film, Kid Galahad) and 1960s proto-punk bands like <b>The</b> <b>Missing</b> <b>Links,</b> The Stooges and MC5. They rehearsed in a shed {{at the back}} of Hay's place, which was opposite the local police headquarters.|$|E

[...] In 1965, the Who released the mod anthem, [...] "My Generation", which according to John Reed, anticipated the kind of [...] "cerebral mix of musical ferocity and rebellious posture" [...] that would characterize much of the later British punk rock of the 1970s.

[...] The Easybeats became the most popular group in Australia during the mid-sixties. [...] Most of their pre-1967 songs were written by vocalist Stevie Wright and guitarist George Young, the older brother of Angus Young and Malcolm Young, later of AC/DC. [...] In late 1966, they re-located to London and had a worldwide hit with [...] "Friday on My Mind". [...] One of Sydney's most notorious acts was <b>the</b> <b>Missing</b> <b>Links,</b> who throughout 1965 went through a complete and total lineup change between the release their first single in March and on the subsequent releases later that year, such as the primitivist anthems [...] "Wild About You", as well as their self-titled LP. [...] Also in 1966, The Throb had a hit in Australia with their version of [...] "Fortune Teller", and later that year released [...] "Black", a brooding version of a traditional folk ballad noted for its expressionistic use of guitar feedback. [...] The Black Diamonds issued [...] "I Want, Need, Love You" [...] in 1966, a song which featured an intense and hard-driving guitar sound that Ian D. Marks described as [...] "speaker cone-shredding".|$|E

2500|$|Arendt's essay On Violence {{distinguishes between}} {{violence}} and power. She maintains that, although theorists {{of both the}} Left and Right regard violence as an extreme manifestation of power, the two concepts are, in fact, antithetical. Power comes from the collective will and does not need violence to achieve any of its goals, since voluntary compliance takes its place. As governments start losing their legitimacy, violence becomes an artificial means toward the same end and is, therefore, found only {{in the absence of}} power.

Keays then {{approached}} Doug Ford, an innovative electric guitarist from the second line-up of Sydney garage rock band <b>The</b> <b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> and its offshoot Running Jumping Standing Still. The new recruits revitalised the band's career. Ford was a strong songwriter, a good singer and an accomplished electric guitarist who brought a new depth to the band's sound. He and Keays began working as a writing team. Ford's arrival filled the gap left by Bowers' departure and made possible their transition from pop band to rock group.

60|$|Franklin {{was eager}} to be off again. The year 1825 saw him start once more to resume the survey of the polar coast of America. The plan now was to learn {{something}} of the western half of the North American coast, so as to connect the discoveries of Sir Alexander Mackenzie with those made by Cook and others through Bering Strait. Franklin was again accompanied by his gallant friend, Dr Richardson. They passed again overland through the fur country, where the recent union of the rival companies had brought about a new era. They descended the Mackenzie river, {110} wintered on Great Bear Lake, and descended thence to the sea. Franklin struck out westward, his party surveying the coast in open boats. Their journey from their winter quarters to the sea and along the coast covered a thousand miles, and extended to within one hundred and sixty miles of the point that had then been reached by explorers from Bering Strait. At the same time Richardson, going eastward from the Mackenzie, surveyed the coast {{as far as the}} Coppermine river. Their discoveries thus connected the Pacific waters with the Atlantic, {{with the exception of one}} hundred and sixty miles on the north-west, where water was known to exist and only ice blocked the way, and of a line north and south which should bring the discoveries of Parry into connection with those of Franklin. These two were <b>the</b> <b>missing</b> <b>links</b> now needed in the chain of the North-West Passage.|$|E
60|$|It is in {{this area}} that we still find that type of mankind--the Mongolian--which retains a colour of the skin midway between the black or brown-black of the negro, and the ruddy or olive-white of the Caucasian types, a colour which still {{prevails}} over all Northern Asia, over the American continents, and over much of Polynesia. From this primary tint arose, {{under the influence of}} varied conditions, and probably in correlation with constitutional changes adapted to peculiar climates, the varied tints which still exist among mankind. If the reasoning by which this conclusion is reached be sound, and all the earlier stages of man's development from an animal form occurred in the area now indicated, we can better understand how it is that we have as yet met with no traces of <b>the</b> <b>missing</b> <b>links,</b> or even of man's existence during late tertiary times, because no part of the world is so entirely unexplored by the geologist as this very region. The area in question is sufficiently extensive and varied to admit of primeval man having attained to a considerable population, and having developed his full human characteristics, both physical and mental, before there was any need for him to migrate beyond its limits. One of his earliest important migrations was probably into Africa, where, spreading westward, he became modified in colour and hair in correlation with physiological changes adapting him to the climate of the equatorial lowlands. Spreading north-westward into Europe the moist and cool climate led to a modification of an opposite character, and thus may have arisen the three great human types which still exist. Somewhat later, probably, he spread eastward into North-West America and soon scattered himself over the whole continent; and all this may well have occurred in early or middle Pliocene times. Thereafter, at very long intervals, successive waves of migration carried him into every part of the habitable world, and by conquest and intermixture led ultimately to that puzzling gradation of types which the ethnologist in vain seeks to unravel.|$|E
