5|$|In {{between the}} birth of James and Reuben, Morris became {{severely}} ill. During his illness, a man named Gad Farnam moved into the Morris's home to care for him day and night. The two families became very close and Gad's daughter Rhoda, only five {{years old at the}} time of the illness, later became Morris's second wife. It was at this point in Morris's life that he accepted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> realize his early dream of becoming a minister.|$|E
5|$|The senator {{alleged that}} Stevenson had downplayed {{the threat of}} communism, and was thus unfit to be president. He affirmed that Eisenhower was the only man fit {{to lead the country}} in ridding the {{government}} of corruption and communism. Reading parts of a letter from the wife of a serviceman fighting in the Korean War, who, despite her financial woes, had scraped together $10 to donate to the campaign, Nixon promised <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> cash that check.|$|E

5|$|While {{awaiting}} his execution, Bonnet {{wrote to}} Governor Johnson, begging abjectly for clemency and promising {{to have his}} own arms and legs cut off as assurance <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> again commit piracy. Charles Johnson wrote that Bonnet's visibly disintegrating mind moved many Carolinians to pity, particularly the female population, and London papers later reported that the governor delayed his execution seven times. Bonnet was eventually hanged at White Point Garden, in Charles Town, on 10December 1718.|$|E
5|$|After Mussolini {{had made}} clear in 1922 <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> {{give up the}} region of South Tyrol from being in Italy, Hitler adopted this position. Hitler in Mein Kampf had {{declared}} that concerns over the rights of Germans in South Tyrol under Italian sovereignty was a non-issue considering the advantages that would be gained from a German-Italian alliance with Mussolini's Fascist regime. In Mein Kampf Hitler also made {{clear that he was}} opposed to having a war with Italy for the sake of obtaining South Tyrol. This position by Hitler of abandoning German land claims to South Tyrol produced aggravation among some NSDAP members who up to the late 1920s found it difficult to accept the position.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Eastwood {{teamed up}} with Jeff Bridges and George Kennedy in the buddy action caper Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, a road movie about a veteran bank robber Thunderbolt (Eastwood) and a young con man drifter, Lightfoot (Bridges). On its release, in spring 1974, the film was praised for its offbeat comedy mixed with high {{suspense}} and tragedy but was only a modest success at the box office, earning $32.4million. Eastwood's acting was noted by critics, but was overshadowed by Bridges who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Eastwood reportedly fumed {{at the lack of}} Academy Award recognition for him and swore <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> work for United Artists again.|$|E

5000|$|On July 29, 2016, Donahue {{suffered}} a catastrophic, paralyzing stroke. [...] According to reports published several weeks later, doctors told his family <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> probably <b>never</b> {{play the guitar}} again.|$|R
5|$|Speaking {{publicly}} about Biko's death, the country's police minister Jimmy Kruger initially implied {{that it had}} been the result of a hunger strike, a statement he later denied. His account was challenged by some of Biko's friends, including Woods, who said that Biko had told them <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> kill himself in prison. Publicly, he stated that Biko had been plotting violence, a claim repeated in the pro-government press. South Africa's attorney general initially stated that no one would be prosecuted for Biko's death. Two weeks after the funeral, the government banned all Black Consciousness organisations, including the BCP, which had its assets seized.|$|E
5|$|Stephen III died on 4 March 1172, and Béla {{decided to}} return to Hungary. Before his departure, he pledged <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> make war against the Byzantine Empire. Although the Hungarian prelates and lords {{unanimously}} proclaimed Béla king, Lucas, Archbishop of Esztergom opposed his coronation because of Béla's alleged simony. Finally, the Archbishop of Kalocsa crowned him king on 18 January 1173, with Pope Alexander III's approval. Béla fought with his younger brother, Géza, whom he held in captivity for more than a decade. Taking advantage of the internal conflicts in the Byzantine Empire after Emperor Manuel's death, Béla reoccupied Croatia, Dalmatia and Sirmium between 1180 and 1181. He occupied the Principality of Halych in 1188, but it was lost within two years.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Groves {{remained}} {{in charge of}} the Manhattan Project until responsibility for nuclear weapons production was handed over to the United States Atomic Energy Commission in 1947. He then headed the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, which had been created to control the military aspects of nuclear weapons. He was given a dressing down by the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, and told <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> be appointed Chief of Engineers. Three days later, Groves announced his intention to leave the Army. He was promoted to lieutenant general just before his retirement on 29 February 1948 in recognition of his leadership of the bomb program. By a special Act of Congress, his date of rank was backdated to 16 July 1945, the date of the Trinity nuclear test. He {{went on to become a}} vice-president at Sperry Rand.|$|E
50|$|Nellum had to redshirt the 2009 {{season at}} USC, after being {{shot in the}} leg by two gang members. Nellum was told by doctors <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{probably}} <b>never</b> again reach world-class speeds as a runner.|$|R

5000|$|Ronald William [...] "Ron" [...] Dixon [...] is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in the British soap opera, Brookside, played by Vince Earl [...] from 1990 until the final episode in 2003, during which time {{he was involved in}} several major storylines including his marriage to DD, being charged with murder and his feud with Jimmy Corkhill. His final words on the programme were to tell Jimmy <b>that</b> <b>he</b> hoped <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> see him again.|$|R
5|$|After their {{invasion}} in Operation Weserübung, Hitler vowed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> again leave Norway, and favored annexing Denmark as a German province even more {{due to its}} small size and relative closeness to Germany. Himmler's hopes were {{an expansion of the}} project so that Iceland would also be included among the group of Germanic countries which would have to be gradually incorporated into the Reich. He was also among the group of more esoteric National Socialists who believed either Iceland or Greenland to be the mystical land of Thule, a purported original homeland of the ancient Aryan race. From a military point of view, the Kriegsmarine command hoped to see the Spitsbergen, Iceland, Greenland, the Faroe Isles and possibly the Shetland Isles (which were also claimed by the Quisling regime) under its domination to guarantee German naval access to the mid-Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Discharged {{from the}} army, Willkie {{returned}} to Elwood. He considered {{a run for}} Congress as a Democrat, but was advised that the district was so Republican he {{would be unlikely to}} keep the seat even if he could win it, and his chances might be better in a more urban area. Herman Willkie wanted Wendell and Robert to rejoin the family law firm, but Henrietta was opposed, feeling that opportunities in Elwood were too limited for her sons. She got her way, and in May 1919 Wendell Willkie successfully applied for a job with the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company in Akron, Ohio as head of the legal office that advised workers on wills and other personal matters. He was soon bored there, and on the advice of his wife, left for a law firm despite an offer from Harvey Firestone to double his salary. Firestone told the departing lawyer <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> amount to anything because he was a Democrat.|$|E
5|$|Late in that season, the Calgary Flames dealt all-star forward Theoren Fleury, {{along with}} Chris Dingman, to the Avalanche for Rene Corbet, Wade Belak, a draft pick and {{their choice of}} a {{prospect}} from a list provided by Colorado. Impressed with his defensive potential, the Flames later chose Regehr to complete that trade. His professional career nearly ended before it started, as he was seriously injured {{in an automobile accident}} near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan on July 4, 1999. Regehr, who was driving home from a summer trip with his elder brother Dinho (Ronald) and two female friends, was struck head-on by another vehicle that crossed into his path. He suffered two broken legs in the crash that killed two people in the other vehicle. Doctors initially feared <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> play hockey again.|$|E
50|$|Mary Richards, born in Roseburg, Minnesota in April 1939, is {{the only}} child of Walter and Dottie Richards.

I have no doubt <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have <b>never</b> seen the inside of a jail but for the abnormal political situation. Who is entitled to label him a murderer or a suicide?" ...|$|R
50|$|The 1980s were a {{difficult}} time for Boca, and Gatti had periods of inactivity during those years. His last match was on 11 September 1988, a day in which an error by him cost him Boca the result. He was made a reserve after <b>that,</b> and <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> play an official match again.|$|R
5|$|On {{an episode}} of Colt Cabana's Art of Wrestling podcast {{released}} in November 2014, Punk broke his silence regarding his exit from WWE. In a detailed interview, Punk {{said that he was}} suspended for two months after walking out on the company in January and that after the suspension ended, nobody from WWE contacted him. He also told that when he reached out to them for unpaid royalties, he was given a run-around by company executives until he was handed his termination papers and was fired by WWE on his wedding day in June 2014. The manner of firing was the last straw for Punk, stating <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> return to WWE and that following a legal settlement with WWE, there would be no further working relationship between them. The settlement included Punk giving WWE permission to sell his remaining merchandise.|$|E
5|$|One {{month before}} the Senators were to open the new Palladium, after three-straight last place finishes, and poor {{attendance}} at the Civic Centre, the Senators organization was in turmoil. Star player Alexei Yashin, angered that management favoured Daigle over him despite posting higher numbers, was a contract hold-out. First-round draft choice Bryan Berard, who had left the Senators training camp unsigned to a contract, had publicly stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> report to the Senators. After Head Coach Rick Bowness demoted Daigle had been demoted to the fourth line, General Manager Randy Sexton fired Bowness and Assistant Coach Alain Vigneault on November 20, 1995. He replaced the coaches with Prince Edward Island Senators coach Dave Allison and gave the assistant coaching job to former Hartford Whalers Head Coach Pierre McGuire, who {{was working at the}} time as a scout for the Senators. Daigle was returned to full-time duty, but Sexton's changes did not improve the team's play.|$|E
5|$|Raynald {{was held}} in prison until 1176. After his release for a large ransom, he {{did not return to}} Antioch, because his wife had {{meanwhile}} died. He married Stephanie of Milly, the wealthy heiress of Oultrejordain. Since Baldwin IV of Jerusalem also granted Hebron to him, Raynald was one of the wealthiest barons of the realm. He controlled the caravan routes between Egypt and Syria. Baldwin, who suffered from leprosy, made him regent in 1177. Raynald led the crusader army that defeated Saladin at the Battle of Montgisard. He was the only Christian leader to pursue an offensive policy against Saladin, making plundering raids against the caravans travelling near his domains. He built a fleet of five ships which plundered the coast of the Red Sea, threatening the route of the Muslim pilgrims towards Mecca in early 1183. Saladin pledged <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> forgive Raynald.|$|E
60|$|When he {{made the}} leap for the {{catamaran}} Walter was not as fortunate as those around him. He entered the water close to the Merrimac, and when the great collier sank, the suction drew him under, and he went so far down <b>that</b> <b>he</b> fancied <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> come up. His breath was gone, a gulp partly filled him with water, and when at last {{the surface of the}} bay was again reached he came up more dead than alive.|$|R
60|$|Leonard {{handed over}} the ruby, {{reflecting}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> probably <b>never</b> see it again, since it seemed almost certain {{that one of the}} Great People would steal it. However, at the moment he was thinking of that which was far above rubies, namely, of what chance they had of escaping with their lives.|$|R
50|$|MacDonald {{would live}} long enough to see the $344,276 project {{targeted}} with allegations of political patronage after the March 5, 1891 Canadian election. As he suffered a series of strokes in 1891, one of which proved fatal on June 6 of <b>that</b> year, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have the opportunity to see the facility open and in operation.|$|R
5|$|The player later {{meets with}} members of the Blades, an order of dragon hunters. The player and the Blades travel to Alduin's Wall, a prophetic engravement, to learn that ancient Nords used a special shout against Alduin so they could engage him. To gain more information, the player meets the ancient dragon Paarthurnax, the leader of the Greybeards. Paarthurnax reveals that Alduin was cast into the {{currents}} of time by the use of an Elder Scroll in the hope <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> reemerge. The player locates the Elder Scroll and uses it to peer through a window in time and learn the shout to combat Alduin. The player battles with Alduin, who then flees to Sovngarde, the Nordic afterlife, to gain strength by devouring the souls of deceased Nords.|$|E
5|$|The {{police at}} first {{believed}} that Sheila, diagnosed with schizophrenia, had fired the shots then turned {{the gun on}} herself. But weeks after the murders Jeremy Bamber's ex-girlfriend told police that he had implicated himself. The prosecution argued that, motivated by a large inheritance, Bamber had shot the family with his father's semi-automatic rifle, then placed {{the gun in his}} unstable sister's hands {{to make it look like}} a murder–suicide. A silencer the prosecution said was on the rifle would have made it too long, they argued, for Sheila's fingers to reach the trigger to shoot herself. Bamber was convicted of five counts of murder in October 1986 by a 10–2 majority, sentenced to a minimum of 25 years, and informed in 1994 <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> be released. The Court of Appeal upheld the verdict in 2002.|$|E
5|$|In April, 1972 he was reassigned {{from the}} SAC to TAC {{and to the}} 42nd Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron (42 TEWS), 388th Tactical Fighter Wing, at Korat, Thailand. He was {{familiar}} with targeting both SAC missiles and SAC airplanes, {{was one of the}} most knowledgeable missile and electronic counter-measures experts in Vietnam, and it is likely that his situation was quickly reported to U.S. intelligence services. Very few Americans remained on the ground in Vietnam, and the NVA made it a point to track particularly valuable personnel, even in Thailand. The North Vietnamese were probably supported by the Russians with decrypting American message traffic and they likely knew exactly who had parachuted into their midst. This ability was likely enabled by the then unknown American spy CWO John Anthony Walker, who had given the Soviets a radio cipher card and other high-value intelligence. Hambleton's capture would be a terrific blow to American airpower around the world and a huge prize for the North Vietnamese and indirectly, the Soviets. Hambleton said after the war that he felt sure if he were captured <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have been taken to Hanoi.|$|E

25|$|Baldwin's solo reign lasted {{just over}} a year, and {{he died in the}} autumn of 1186, at Acre. He had been so weak and ill {{throughout}} his childhood that his death was anticipated. His death reinforced the long held assumption <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have <b>never</b> lived to maturity or long enough to produce an heir.|$|R
