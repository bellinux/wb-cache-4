5|$|Through {{studies of}} carbon isotope ratios (similar to the {{methodology}} used in carbon dating, except with the stable isotopes C-12 and C-13), {{it has been}} shown that the carbon found in diamonds comes from both inorganic and organic sources. Some diamonds, known as harzburgitic, are formed from inorganic carbon originally found deep in the Earth's mantle. In contrast, eclogitic diamonds contain organic carbon from organic detritus that has been pushed down from the surface of the Earth's crust through subduction (see plate tectonics) before transforming into diamond. These two different source of carbon have measurably different 13C:12C ratios. Diamonds <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the Earth's surface are generally quite old, ranging from under 1billion to 3.3billion years old. This is 22% to 73% of the age of the Earth.|$|E

According to another estimate, between 2.35 and 2.9 million Polish Jews and about 2 million ethnic Poles were killed. Nazi Germany intended to exterminate the Jews completely, in actions <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> be described collectively as the Holocaust.

[...] He noted that the painting is the only [...] "canonized" [...] one depicting the October 1 ceremony, and that other artists have tended to give the people's perspective, subjecting themselves to Mao's gaze. [...] The painting is a modern-day example of damnatio memoriae, the alteration of artworks or other objects to remove the image or name of a disfavored person. [...] Deng Zhangyu, in a 2014 article, called the painting [...] "the most significant historical image of China's founding". [...] Wu Hung suggested that the alterations to it over the years, while always showing Mao proclaiming the new government, parallel the changes <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> China's leadership {{during the years of}} Communist governance. [...] Andrews wrote that [...] "its greatest importance to the art world was its elevation as a model of party-approved oil painting". [...] Writer Wu Bing in 2009 called it [...] "a milestone in Chinese oil painting, boldly incorporating national styles". [...] The painting has never been as highly regarded in the West as in China; according to Andrews, [...] "art history students have been known to roar with laughter when slides of it appear on the screen". [...] Art historian Michael Sullivan dismissed it as mere propaganda. [...] Today, following a merger of museums, both paintings are in the National Museum of China, on Tiananmen Square.|$|E
