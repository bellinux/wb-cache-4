5|$|Baltimore Avenue and Philadelphia Avenue {{date back}} to the {{founding}} of Ocean City in 1875. Both avenues originally extended from South Division Street to North Division Street. The streets were later extended north as far as 15th Street. Baltimore Avenue served as the main thoroughfare of Ocean City until Philadelphia Avenue and Coastal Highway assumed predominance in the 1950s. MD 378 was assigned to Baltimore Avenue, which was paved from US 213 (Worcester Street) to 15th Street by 1927. MD 528 was assigned to Philadelphia Avenue when <b>that</b> <b>street</b> was rebuilt between US 213 and 15th Street in 1933. MD 528 was extended north to the Delaware state line when Coastal Highway was completed in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Building {{on what is}} now Mayfair {{began in}} the 1660s, {{initially}} {{on the corner of}} Piccadilly, and progressed along the north side of <b>that</b> <b>street.</b> Burlington House was constructed between 1664–5 by John Denham, but was sold two years later to Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Burlington who asked Hugh May to complete it. The house was extensively modified through the 18th century, and {{is the only one of}} this era to survive into the 21st century.|$|E

5|$|The freeway segment {{northwest}} of Wyoming Avenue {{to the county}} line was previously known as James Couzens Highway after the street it replaced. <b>That</b> <b>street</b> was named {{after the death of}} James J. Couzens. Couzens was a former Commissioner of Detroit's Department of Street Railways from 1913 through 1915, after which he served as Police Commissioner from 1916 until 1918. He was Mayor of Detroit from 1919 until 1922 and United States Senator from Michigan from 1922 until his death on October 22, 1936. During his years of public service, he is said not to have accepted a salary, giving it all to charity. After his death, Detroit renamed its section of Northwestern Highway after Couzens.|$|E
5|$|The {{roads that}} have carried US12 in Michigan {{have been given}} a number of {{memorial}} highway names. In 1922, after the publication of Main Street by Sinclair Lewis <b>that</b> <b>street</b> name took on a pejorative connotation. The newspaper in Jackson advocated that the main road from Detroit to Chicago which formed the main street through many communities in southern Michigan should be given a new name. It was already labeled the Michigan–Detroit–Chicago Highway on travel maps of the time, so the paper suggested that the roadway should be renamed to create the longest street in the country. Both Chicago and Detroit had streets named Michigan Avenue, so that is what the newspaper suggested for a new name. Albion was the first community to change the name of its street followed by Jackson and Marshall in 1924, Battle Creek in 1928 and Kalamazoo in 1929.|$|E
5|$|US141 {{starts at}} an {{interchange}} with I-43 southeast of Green Bay in the suburb of Bellevue. From the terminus at exit178, US141 runs north to Main Street, and then northwesterly along Main Street through town. Wisconsin Highway29 (WIS29) merges with US141 at an intersection {{on the northwest}} side of Bellevue, and the two highways run concurrently through residential subdivisions. Main Street passes over I-43 and continues {{to the north and}} into the city of Green Bay. US141/WIS29 crosses Baird Creek and runs {{along the banks of the}} East River. At the intersection with Monroe Avenue, WIS29 turns south, joining WIS54/WIS57 while US141 continues westward on Main Street to cross the Fox River on the Ray Nitschke Memorial Bridge. On the west side of the river, the highway follows Dousman Street for a block before turning north along Broadway Avenue for four blocks. From there, the highway follows Mather Street west to Velp Avenue. US141 follows <b>that</b> <b>street</b> northwesterly and parallel to I-43 on the north side of Green Bay. This area is mostly residential with some businesses immediately on either side. In the suburb of Howard, US141 merges onto the US41 freeway via the interchange at exit170. US41/US141 has an interchange for I-43 just south of the Duck Creek crossing.|$|E

5000|$|Jones deeded {{the site}} of the street to the city with the {{stipulation}} <b>that</b> any <b>street</b> <b>that</b> ran through the property had to be named for him. However, when the street was first created in 1789, the city already had a Jones Street in Greenwich Village, named for Dr. Gardner Jones, Samuel Jones's brother-in-law. [...] The confusion between two streets with the same name was broken when Samuel Jones suggested <b>that</b> his <b>street</b> be called Great Jones Street. An alternative theory suggests <b>that</b> the <b>street</b> was called [...] "Great" [...] because it was the wider of the two Jones Streets.|$|R
5|$|Early maps {{show that}} the Terminal Island Freeway was to extend north to the Long Beach Freeway (I-710) near the San Diego Freeway (I-405), but the {{location}} for SR 47 adopted by the California Highway Commission on January 22, 1969 led northwest from the Terminal Island Freeway's end at Carson Street to I-405 near Alameda Street, and then paralleled <b>that</b> <b>street</b> into Los Angeles. A 1982 state law specified that SR 47 shall use Henry Ford Avenue and Alameda Street between the Heim Bridge and the Redondo Beach Freeway (SR 91), rather than the adopted alignment to the east, and in 1984 the legislature created State Route 103 to replace the former alignment on the Terminal Island Freeway between SR 47 and the Pacific Coast Highway (SR 1). Due to the cancellation of the Industrial Freeway and planned port expansions, the Alameda Corridor project was created, including an improved rail line and a widening of Alameda Street from four to six lanes south of SR 91. Alameda Street was rebuilt for the project, with grade separations at most major streets south of SR 91, and is now signed as part of SR 47 there, but remains mostly four lanes. As part of a project to replace the Heim Bridge, Caltrans and the Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority plan to improve the connection near {{the south end of}} Alameda Street, possibly by building a new expressway replacement for SR 47 south of SR 1, or by extending SR 103 northwest via the originally-planned alignment to Alameda Street south of I-405.|$|E

On <b>that</b> <b>street</b> it goes north for a few lots then crosses the block between Grand and Trinity Place just north of a large old factory. At <b>that</b> <b>street</b> it goes south a few lots, then returns to South Pearl after excluding another industrial property.|$|E

It excludes the lot at the corner of South Pearl and follows the rear lines of houses on South Ferry to Franklin Street, leaving out not only the newer buildings along South Pearl but the parking lots behind them as well. It follows the property lines along Westerlo west of Franklin to include the houses on both sides of <b>that</b> <b>street,</b> then returns to Franklin again.|$|E
25|$|Much of Calgary's {{street network}} is on a grid where roads are {{numbered}} with avenues running east–west and streets running north–south. Until 1904 {{the streets were}} named; after <b>that</b> date, all <b>streets</b> were given numbers radiating outwards from the city centre. Roads in predominantly residential areas as well as freeways and expressways do not generally conform to the grid and are usually not numbered as a result. However, it is a developer and city convention in Calgary <b>that</b> non-numbered <b>streets</b> within a new community have the same name prefix as the community itself so <b>that</b> <b>streets</b> can more easily be located within the city.|$|R
