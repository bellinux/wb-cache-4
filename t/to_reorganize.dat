5|$|After several revisions, the {{studbook}} {{was closed}} in 1922 after registering 424 foundation horses. The {{closing of the}} studbook brought about additional purebred breeding and selection based on conformation, color and working ability.

Thus the mechanized brigade would form the first line, the two infantry brigades would form the second line, and the reserve armored brigade would constitute a third echelon.|$|E

5|$|During its 2002 annual session, the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) added 14 {{amendments}} to the Constitution of Indonesia. Included in these amendments were measures <b>to</b> <b>reorganize</b> the legislature. Beginning in 2004, the MPR was composed of the existing People's Representative Council (DPR) and a new Regional Representative Council (DPD). Because all {{the seats in the}} MPR were directly elected, this called for removal of the military from the legislature, whose 38 seats in the Assembly were appointed. This change and an amendment for direct election of the President and Vice President were major steps for Indonesia on the road towards a full democracy.|$|E

George Martinuzzi, bishop of Várad, soon started <b>to</b> <b>reorganize</b> the government {{in the name of the}} dowager queen and her son. The Ottomans assisted the bishop by capturing his opponent, Stephen Majláth, although the sultan had earlier confirmed the latter's position as voivode. An assembly of the Three Nations elected George Martinuzzi as governor on behalf of the infant king in 1542.|$|E
5|$|On April 10, 1826, Rowan {{sponsored}} {{an amendment}} to legislation <b>to</b> <b>reorganize</b> the federal judiciary that would have required seven justices to concur with a decision in order to strike down a law as unconstitutional.

Rowan offered another amendment providing that ministers of the federal courts would be subject to state laws when carrying out the decisions of the federal courts. After a month of debate, the entire bill was tabled.|$|E

Stuart barely repulsed the Union attack and required more time <b>to</b> <b>reorganize</b> and rearm. This inconclusive battle {{was the largest}} predominantly cavalry engagement of the Civil War to that time. This battle proved {{for the first time}} that the Union horse soldiers, like Carpenter, were equal to their Southern counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Recurving to the northeast, Faye {{continued}} weakening due {{to strong}} wind shear, with dissipation as a tropical cyclone occurring {{on the afternoon}} of August27.

Faye intensified slightly, nearly attaining typhoon intensity on August29, but this trend was short-lived due to increased wind shear. By August31, a building ridge to Faye's north led to a southwest motion as the system steadily weakened. However, Faye managed to maintain its identity as a weak tropical cyclone for several days, before finally dissipating on September3.|$|E

The warnings were justified; shortly after his departure, the Junta was turned into a legislative power, while the executive would be managed by the First Triumvirate. This arrangement lasted for a short time, then the Junta was abolished. The Regiment of Patricians made a mutiny against the triumvirate, but failed.|$|E
