5|$|On 6 August, Quwatli {{established}} a long-term {{agreement with the}} USSR, entailing a long-term Soviet loan to fund development works in Syria and the Soviet purchase of {{a large portion of}} Syrian agricultural and textile surpluses. US fears <b>that</b> <b>Syria</b> was approaching a communist takeover had prompted an attempted CIA-sponsored coup to replace the Quwatli government with former president Shishakli. However, the coup plot was foiled by the head of Syrian intelligence, Abdel Hamid al-Sarraj, on 12 August and Syria consequently expelled the US military attaché from Damascus. The US, which denied the coup plot, responded by expelling the Syrian ambassador from Washington and recalling its ambassador from Syria.|$|E
5|$|The first {{shipment}} of components for chemical weapons {{were removed from}} Syria by a Norwegian/Danish flotilla on 7 January 2014. The 31 December deadline for complete removal of priority chemicals had been missed; on 7 January, the New York Times assessed the delay {{was due to the}} difficulty of overland transport of chemical weapons {{in the middle of a}} civil war. A second shipment was removed around 27 January; that same day, the U.N. Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, expressed concern over the worsening delays and assessed <b>that</b> <b>Syria</b> already has the resources required to transport the weapons promptly despite the ongoing civil war.|$|E
5|$|The {{resolution}} requires <b>that</b> <b>Syria</b> eliminate its chemical stockpile {{and allow}} complete access to UN and OPCW chemical weapons inspectors. If {{it does not}} comply with either demand, the Security Council would need to adopt a second resolution regarding imposition of military or other actions against Syria under the UN Charter's Chapter VII. The vote on the resolution was delayed until 27 September because the OPCW needed to vote first on its detailed implementation plan. Syria vowed {{to abide by the}} resolution.|$|E

5|$|On September 13, 1973, an air battle {{took place}} between Syrian and Israeli fighters. It was an {{alarming}} skirmish in which twelve Syrian aircraft were shot down while the Israelis lost only one fighter. Tension ran high between both countries. The Egyptians in particular were very concerned; on April 7, 1967, an air battle between Syria and Israel had escalated the military situation {{and was one of}} the causes of the Six Day War. Aware that war was to be launched only days later, the Syrians chose not to retaliate. The air battle aided the Syrians in concentrating their forces for the war, as the Israelis interpreted it to be a defensive reaction on the part of the Syrians. The Israelis closely monitored this buildup near the front, but their intelligence remained adamant <b>that</b> <b>Syria</b> would not go to war without Egypt, which the Israelis believed was currently occupied with internal issues.|$|E

50|$|Al-Tikriti's {{interview}} was featured prominently on conservative web {{sites such as}} FrontPageMag and WorldNetDaily, but did not receive mainstream press attention.

2500|$|On 20 December 2012, a UN Independent Commission of Inquiry said <b>that</b> <b>Syria's</b> newest insurgent groups {{increasingly}} operate {{independently of}} the rebel command and some are affiliated with al-Qaeda.

5000|$|On 1 October, the Syrian Ambassador to Russia, Riyad Haddad, {{stated that}} the Russian air force is acting in full {{coordination}} with the Syrian army. He added <b>that</b> <b>Syria's</b> position is <b>that</b> the Russian intervention is the only legitimate intervention under international law and called for other countries to join the [...] "non-criminal" [...] Russian intervention in Syria.|$|R
5000|$|On 10 December 2012, the U.S. {{designated}} Nusra {{a foreign}} terrorist organization and an alias of Al Qaeda in Iraq. That decision made it illegal for Americans to deal financially with Nusra. Days earlier, the American ambassador to Syria, R. Ford, had said: [...] "Extremist groups like Jabhat al-Nusra are a problem, {{an obstacle to}} finding the political solution <b>that</b> <b>Syria’s</b> going to need".|$|R
25|$|In April 2008, President Assad told a Qatari {{newspaper}} <b>that</b> <b>Syria</b> and Israel {{had been}} discussing {{a peace treaty}} for a year, with Turkey acting as a mediator.

Medvedev also said it was imperative <b>that</b> <b>Syria</b> not slide into civil war as Libya had.|$|E

These examinations of the provenance of the clay used to create the tablets indicate <b>that</b> <b>Syria</b> could not be the location of Alashiya, while clay on Cyprus is a good match.|$|E
50|$|However, {{there was}} {{resistance}} from French diplomats, who insisted <b>that</b> <b>Syria's</b> future {{was as a}} French colony not an independent Arab state. There were also strong objections from the Government of India which, although nominally part of the British government, acted independently. Its vision was of Mesopotamia under British control serving as a granary for India; furthermore, it wanted {{to hold on to}} its Arabian outpost in Aden.|$|R
5000|$|Bashir al-Azma was one {{of several}} Syrian Prime Ministers who {{intended}} to keep Syria out of the East-West conflict and demonstrate its passive approach to it.

25|$|Syria {{continued}} {{to demand a}} full Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 borders, including a strip of land on the east shore of the Sea of Galilee <b>that</b> <b>Syria</b> captured during the 1948–49 Arab-Israeli War and occupied from 1949–67. Successive Israeli governments have considered an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan in return for normalization of relations with Syria, provided certain security concerns are met. Prior to 2000, Syrian president Hafez al-Assad rejected normalization with Israel.|$|E
25|$|Following an 4 October {{suicide bombing}} in Maxim restaurant, Haifa, which claimed {{the lives of}} 21 Israelis, Israel claimed <b>that</b> <b>Syria</b> and Iran {{sponsored}} the Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah, and were responsible for the terrorist attack. The day after the Maxim massacre, IAF warplanes bombed an alleged former Palestinian training base at Ain Saheb, Syria, which had been mostly abandoned since the 1980s. Munitions being stored on the site were destroyed, and a civilian guard was injured.|$|E
25|$|At {{one point}} {{there seemed to}} be {{confusion}} {{about the extent to which}} Syria was willing to withdraw from Lebanon. Arab League head Amr Moussa declared that Syrian president Assad promised him a phased withdrawal over a two-year period, but the Syrian Information Minister Mahdi Dakhlallah said that Moussa had misunderstood the Syrian leader. Dakhlallah said <b>that</b> <b>Syria</b> will merely move its troops to eastern Lebanon. Since then, Syria has declared that Resolution 1559 will be fully complied with, and in a matter of months rather than years.|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} {{to the use of}} chemical weapons against civilians during the 2013 Ghouta chemical attack, president Barack Obama asked Congress to authorize {{the use of military force}} against Syria.

50|$|The Israel-Syria front {{remained}} relatively quiet {{during the first}} four days of the Six-Day War, despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>Syria's</b> air force had been destroyed on the first day. Syria's response was the shelling of the Israeli settlements of Upper Galilee from the Golan Heights as they had done for years. Two Syrian artillery battalions with M46 Soviet 130mm guns and two companies with heavy mortars and dug-in German World War II Panzer IV tanks were positioned along the Golan escarpment.|$|R

25|$|On 22 January 1976, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad {{brokered}} a truce {{between the}} two sides, while covertly beginning to move Syrian troops into Lebanon {{under the guise of}} the Palestine Liberation Army in order to bring the PLO back under Syrian influence and prevent the disintegration of Lebanon. Despite this, the violence continued to escalate. In March 1976, Lebanese President Suleiman Frangieh requested <b>that</b> <b>Syria</b> formally intervene. Days later, Assad sent a message to the United States asking them not to interfere if he were to send troops into Lebanon.|$|E
25|$|Following World War II, the {{surrounding}} Arab nations were emerging from mandatory rule. Transjordan, under the Hashemite ruler Abdullah I, gained independence from Britain in 1946 and was called Jordan in 1949, but it remained under heavy British influence. Egypt gained nominal independence in 1922, but Britain continued to exert {{a strong influence}} on the country until the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 which limited Britain’s presence to a garrison of troops on the Suez Canal until 1945. Lebanon became an independent state in 1943, but French troops would not withdraw until 1946, the same year <b>that</b> <b>Syria</b> won its independence from France.|$|E
25|$|For {{decades the}} {{international}} diplomatic community has requested <b>that</b> <b>Syria</b> and Lebanon {{take steps to}} determine the exact boundary and officially register the demarcated border with the United Nations. However, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria has refused to do so. On 31 October 2007, {{the definition of the}} physical extent of the Shebaa Farms area by former UN cartographer Miklos Pinther was released by the UN. This could be a prelude to an eventual negotiated demarcation of the territory. However, as of October 2013, neither Israel nor Syria had given an official response to the proposal.|$|E
