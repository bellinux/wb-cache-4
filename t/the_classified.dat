5|$|Vettel {{maintained}} his lead {{and crossed the}} start/finish line on lap 57 to win the race. Hamilton finished second, with his teammate Button third. Barrichello clinched fourth (his best result of the season), ahead of Kubica, Sutil and Kobayashi. Buemi took eighth on the road, and Alonso and de la Rosa rounded out the top ten. Petrov was the first non-points scoring finisher in eleventh, followed by Rosberg, Liuzzi and Massa. Alguersuari clinched 15th, half a second ahead of Schumacher. Di Grassi, Glock, Chandhok and Senna filled the next three positions, with Trulli the last of <b>the</b> <b>classified</b> finishers. It was Vettel's second victory of the season, and the seventh of his career.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{was able}} to further open up a twenty-two second lead {{over the rest of}} the field and {{maintained}} it for the remainder of the race to secure the victory. Ceccon finished one with one second covering Evans in third and Nasr in fourth; Evans narrowly fended off Nasr for the final podium place. Calado secured fifth with Coletti taking sixth and Binder seventh. Quaife-Hobbs passed Richemi for eighth place in the final stages of the race and thus earned the sprint race pole position. Richelmi and De Jong rounded out the top-ten points-scoring positions. Dillmann, Lancaster, Trummer, Rosenzweig and Canamasas took the next five places and Abt was the last of <b>the</b> <b>classified</b> finishers. It was Bird's third win in the GP2 Series, his (and Russian Time's) second of the season, and his first victory at the circuit since his 2012 Formula Renault 3.5 Series Monaco round triumph. After the race, the stewards deemed Cecotto responsible for causing the first lap accident that triggered the race's sole stoppage and Cecotto was barred from competing in the following day's sprint event.|$|E

The attrition race was low, with 16 of the 26 starters finishing the race.|$|E
5|$|Franchitti {{gained the}} lead and held it at the lap-180 restart. Junqueira {{attempted}} to pass Servià around the inside for fourth position {{but was unable to}} get ahead. Carpentier attempted to pressure da Matta {{towards the end of the}} race but it was difficult to overtake and he did not want to be very aggressive and run off the racing line. Vasser set the race's fastest lap during the 210th (and penultimate) lap, competing a circuit of 25.217 seconds. Franchitti maintained the lead for the remainder of the race and crossed the start-finish line after 211 laps to win the race.

5|$|Giovinazzi quickly caught Marciello and overtook him (with {{the help}} of DRS and drafting) {{at the start of}} lap 18 to take over the lead. Giovinazzi began to pull away from Maricello. The safety car was {{deployed}} for the fourth (and final) time after Nato attempted to pass teammate King around the inside and retired from the race having been squeezed into the turn three barrier by him. The area was cleared of Nato's damaged car over the next five laps which meant the race would finish under a time limit. Giovinazzi accelerated as late as possible to limit the slipstream effect and remained the leader at the lap-25 restart despite locking-up his tyres heading into the first turn. King retired from the race following contact with Eriksson. Giovinazzi remained the leader for the remaining two laps to clinch his first, and his team's maiden, victory in the GP2 Series. Siroktin overtook Rowland for third place and clinched second position from Marciello by drafting behind him on the start/finish straight. Rowland finished in fourth place, ahead of Evans and Matsushita whom he defended from in the final two laps. Gelael, de Jong, Ghiotto, and Malja rounded out the point-scoring positions. Eriksson and King were the last of <b>the</b> <b>classified</b> finishers. The attrition race was high, with ten drivers reaching the end of the race.|$|E
5|$|Haryanto held a three-second {{advantage}} over Visoiu who had worn his tyres, {{and he was}} unable to maintain the pace. Matsushita overtook Visoiu as a result. Vandoorne was overtaken Visoiu on the pit lane straight with the assistance of DRS {{at the start of the}} 16th lap. Vandoorne began to push hard and lapped one second faster than his teammate Matsushita. He moved in front of Matsushita for second place after starting lap 18, providing him with an opportunity to attempt to catch Haryanto during the remainder of the event. Haryanto responded and pulled away from Vandoorne. His teammate Matsushita struggled with pace and was passed by Rossi for third place. Berthon recovered from his poor start and moved ahead of Rossi, with the assistance of DRS, at the start of the final lap. Haryanto crossed the start/finish line after 23 laps to win his first GP2 Series race in his 70th attempt. Vandoorne finished second, ahead of third-placed Berthon. Rossi secured fourth, with Leal fifth. Matsushita, Visoiu, and Negrão rounded out the points-scoring positions. King, Pic, Stanaway, Markelov, de Jong, and Sirotkin filled the next five positions, while Lynn, Nato, Evans, Amberg, Stöckinger, Marciello, Sørensen, and Gasly were the last of <b>the</b> <b>classified</b> finishers.|$|E
5|$|Rossi {{struggled}} with severe tyre degradation and increasingly locked and flat-spotted his tyres. Vandoorne had reduced Rossi's lead by the penultimate lap. He {{chose not to}} rush to avoid damaging his car. He moved into the lead after leaving the back straight when Rossi ran wide at the first hairpin. Haryanto made a similar strategy call as Vandoorne and passed King and Rossi to move into second position. Vandoorne maintained the lead {{for the remainder of}} the race and crossed the start/finish line after 32 laps to win the race. Haryanto finished second, with Rossi in third. King took fourth, ahead of Visoiu and Evans. Berthon, Leal, Negrão, and Matsushita rounded out the top-ten finishers. Eleventh-place finisher Stöckinger became the first driver from the Philippines to complete a GP2 Series race. He was ahead of Sirotkin, Markelov, Canamasas, and Stanaway.

5|$|Stanaway drifted at La Rascasse corner {{after his}} car's {{rear-end}} gave way and narrowly avoided hitting the {{wall on the}} race's final lap. He regained control {{of his car and}} crossed the start/finish line to win the race. Marciello finished second, two seconds behind the race winner and Sirotkin took third. Canamasas secured fourth, and Leal was fifth. Pic, Rossi and Vandoorne filled the remainder of the points-scoring positions and were all separated by 2.5 seconds. Yelloly and Gasly rounded out the top ten. Lynn, de Jong, Vișoiu, Markelov and Berthon followed in the next five places, while Binder, Negrão, Stöckinger, Matushita, Sørensen and Nato were the last of <b>the</b> <b>classified</b> finishers. The victory was Stanaway's first in the GP2 Series and the maiden triumph for his team Status Grand Prix following its take over of the former Caterham Racing entry. Stanaway's victory was the best success for a New Zealand driver at Monaco since Denny Hulme won the 1967 Monaco Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|The race ended early when {{a second}} red flag was waved on lap 46, and its results {{were taken from}} the running order at the end of lap 44. This gave Hamilton the victory, with {{teammate}} Rosberg in second. Vettel took third, ahead of his Red Bull teammate Ricciardo. Button finished fifth, ahead of Massa and Bottas in sixth and seventh. Hülkenberg, Vergne and Pérez rounded out the points-scoring positions. Kvyat, Räikkönen and Gutiérrez filled the next three positions (one lap behind the race winner), with Magnussen, Grosjean, Maldonado, Ericcson, Chilton and Kobayashi the last of <b>the</b> <b>classified</b> finishers who were not involved in any incident. Bianchi and Sutil were classified in 20th and 21st, despite their accidents. There were three lead changes in the race; two drivers reached the front of the field. Rosberg's total of 26 laps led was the highest of any competitor. Hamilton led two different times, for a total of 18 laps.

5|$|The two drivers {{pulled away}} {{from the rest of the}} field. Giovinazzi was unable to use his DRS because it was {{affected}} by a malfunction. He made attempts to overtake Gasly in the closing stages of the event. On the final lap, Giovinazzi drove on the outside line on the start/finish straight and moved to the inside heading into the first corner. Gasly ran wide by missing his braking point while defending, which allowed Giovinazzi to take over the lead. He maintained the position for the remainder of the race to clinch his second consecutive victory. Gasly finished second, with Sirotkin in third. King took fourth, ahead of Markelov in fifth. Canamasas, Jeffri, and Pic rounded out the top-eight points-scoring finishers, Lynn, Kirchhöfer, Marciello, Ghiotto, Latifi, de Jong and Rowland were the last of <b>the</b> <b>classified</b> finishers. Givoinazzi's victories meant he became the first driver since Davide Valsecchi in the first 2012 Bahrain round to win both races in a GP2 Series race weekend, and the seventh driver in the history of the series to achieve this feat.|$|E
5|$|Vettel {{continued}} to push hard {{in his effort}} to pass Massa for second place, while Hamilton was told he was no longer required to conserve fuel on the 63rd lap. Button ran wide at the first corner on the penultimate lap of the race but continued in fifth place. Alonso maintained the lead throughout the remainder of the event and crossed the start/finish line on lap 67 to secure the 23rd victory of his Formula One career. Massa finished second 4.1 seconds behind, and was ahead of Vettel in third. Hamilton secured fourth, with teammate Button in fifth. Webber reduced his pace and managed to finish in sixth place. Kubica, Rosberg, Schumacher and Petrov rounded out the points-scoring positions. Kobayashi {{was the first of the}} non-points scorers in eleventh, followed by Barrichello and Hülkenberg.

5|$|Vettel drew {{to within}} two-tenths {{of a second}} behind Alonso as the final lap started, and came across Sutil, Hülkenberg, Petrov and Massa; both drivers managed to get past Petrov, and Alonso {{maintained}} the first position heading into the final sector of the track. The yellow flag for Kovalainen's car meant that Vettel's final chance of an overtake, into the final corner, was denied, and Alonso took the checkered flag on lap61 to win the race, 0.293 seconds ahead of Vettel. Alonso secured the first, and, as of 2015, the only Grand Chelem (leading the entire race from pole position with fastest lap) of his career {{as well as the}} first since Schumacher achieved the feat at the 2004 Hungarian Grand Prix. Webber was third, 1.2 seconds ahead of Button in fourth. Rosberg, Barrichello and Kubica took the next three positions. Sutil held off Hülkenberg in the final sector of the track for eighth and ninth on the line with Massa in tenth.

40|$|This paper extends certain {{characterizations}} of nullhomotopic maps between p-compact groups to maps with target <b>the</b> p-completed <b>classifying</b> {{space of a}} connected Kac-Moody group and source <b>the</b> <b>classifying</b> space of either a p-compact group or a connected Kac-Moody group. A well known inductive principle for p-compact groups is applied to obtain general, mapping space level results. An arithmetic fiber square computation shows that a null map from <b>the</b> <b>classifying</b> space of a connected compact Lie group to <b>the</b> <b>classifying</b> space of a connected topological Kac-Moody group can be detected by restricting to the maximal torus. Null maps between <b>the</b> <b>classifying</b> spaces of connected topological Kac-Moody groups cannot, in general, be detected by restricting to the maximal torus due to the nonvanishing of an explicit abelian group of obstructions described here. Nevertheless, partial results are obtained via the application of algebraic discrete Morse theory to higher derived limit calculations which show that such detection is possible in many cases of interest.

40|$|For a {{topological group}} G, <b>the</b> <b>classifying</b> space BG is an aspherical CW-complex such that its {{fundamental}} group is G and the universal cover is contractible. In the algebraic K- and L-theories, many long-standing conjectures use notions of <b>the</b> <b>classifying</b> space and <b>the</b> <b>classifying</b> spaces for various families of subgroups. Therefore, finding concrete and simple models of <b>the</b> <b>classifying</b> spaces {{is an important}} subject. <b>The</b> proper <b>classifying</b> space is <b>the</b> <b>classifying</b> space for <b>the</b> family of finite subgroups. There are many finite dimensional models for proper classifying spaces, {{many of which are}} finite, meaning that they consist of only finitely many equivariant cells. As observed by Adem and Ruan and proved by Ji, the Borel-Serre partial compactification provides finite models of <b>the</b> proper <b>classifying</b> space for arithmetic groups in semisimple Lie groups. Margulis’s arithmeticity theorem implies that the Borel-Serre parital compactification also provides finite models for irreducible lattices in higher rank semisimple Lie groups. The existence of finite models of <b>the</b> proper <b>classifying</b> space for general lattices in semisimple Lie groups is not yet fully known until now. The thesis presents the method of constructing finite models of <b>the</b> proper <b>classifying</b> space for general lattices in a semisimple Lie group of R-rank one. This is a generalization of the Borel-Serre partial compatification of rank one symmetric spaces. The resulting finite model is a manifold with boundary and it is obtained from the rank one symmetric space by attaching geometrically rational boundary components with respect to the lattice in concern. The main tools used in the proof are the topology defined by convergence class of sequences, the continuous and proper action of the lattice extended from the canonical action on the interior, Garland and Raghunathan’s reduction theory on lattices in semisimple Lie groups of R-rank one, and Illman’s theorem on the existence of G-CW-complex structures on subanalytic G-manifolds...|$|R
5|$|With ten laps of {{the race}} remaining, Rossi {{reported}} to his team over the radio that his front tyres were degrading, while Vandoorne was experiencing the same issue. King quickly closed the gap to Yelloly and overtook him for ninth place on the 32nd lap. Vandoorne held the lead for the remainder {{of the race}} and crossed the start/finish line after 40 laps to secure his third consecutive GP2 feature race victory of the season, and his seventh in the series. He finished six seconds ahead of Rossi who reduced his speed, with Leal third on the road, but was issued with a ten-second time penalty upon being judged by the stewards to have been unsafely released from his pit stall. As a result, Canamasas inherited third-place, ahead of Pic and Sirotkin. Leal, Stanaway, Maricello, King and Yelloly rounded out the top-ten points-scoring finishers.

5|$|By the 38th lap, {{drivers who}} made their stops during the safety car period entered into their {{electrical}} energy conservation phase. Andretti chose {{to allow their}} drivers {{to remain on the}} circuit {{for as long as possible}} and their strategy allowed Félix da Costa and Frijns to catch and overtake d'Ambrosio and Turvey for the fifth and sixth positions in the event's closing period. Félix da Costa then attempted to catch the fourth-placed Prost but was unable to get close to him. As the field began the final lap, di Grassi, Heidfeld and Prost had five percent of usage electrical energy remaining and Buemi was unchallenged for the remainder of the race to secure the victory. Di Grassi finished second, ahead of Heidfeld in third. Prost was fourth and Félix da Costa fifth. Frijns, d'Ambrosio, Turvey, Engel and Sarrazin rounded out the top ten points-scoring positions. Piquet, Carroll filled the next two positions. Bird was fast enough to unlap himself by passing the race leaders, despite spinning his tyres at the circuit's low-speed exit turns, and finished in 13th. Duval and Rosenqvist were the last of <b>the</b> <b>classified</b> finishers. It was Buemi's first victory of the season and the seventh of his career. There were three lead changes in the race; four drivers reached the front of the field. Buemi led once for a total of 20 laps, more than any other competitor. Of the two other retirements, Vergne stopped with an overheating battery, and Abt lost all electrical energy in his car after 34 laps.|$|E
5|$|Duval {{recorded}} the race's fastest lap on the 30th lap, completing a circuit of {{one minute and}} 22.600 seconds, earning him one championship point. Rosenqvist drove at reduced speed as he was struggling to conserve his battery's energy usage, allowing Bird to close up to him. Bird drafted in Rosenqvist's slipstream and overtook him under braking for second place at the eleventh corner on lap 31. Rosenqvist focused on continuing his effort to preserve electrical energy usage to {{reach the end of}} the event. On the final lap, after Piquet locked his brakes, Evans ran wide, drove off the circuit, and hit the barriers lining the track; he was able to continue. Duval stopped his car for the second time on the same lap. Buemi held the lead {{for the rest of the}} race to secure the victory. Bird finished second, ahead of the third-placed Rosenqvist. Prost took fourth, with di Grassi in fifth. Abt and Turvey overtook Vergne on the final lap to claim the sixth and seventh positions. Heidfeld and López rounded out the top-ten points scoring positions. Frijns, Sarrazin, d'Ambrosio, Carroll and Ma filled the next five places, with Piquet, Evans and Duval the last of <b>the</b> <b>classified</b> finishers. It was Buemi's second consecutive victory of the season, and his eighth in Formula E. There were four lead changes in the race; two drivers reached the front of the field.
