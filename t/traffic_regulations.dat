5|$|Schnaufer never regained {{consciousness}} and succumbed to his injuries {{at the hospital}} two days later on 15 July 1950. The investigation into the accident concluded that though {{the impact of the}} two vehicles was severe, it seemed unlikely that the collision itself was the cause of his injuries. It was speculated {{that at least one of}} the truck's cargo of 30 empty gas cylinders, which were thrown off by the collision, had struck Schnaufer on the head. Subsequently, the truck driver was charged with manslaughter and breach of <b>traffic</b> <b>regulations</b> before a court at Jauge, Cestas. The hearing began on 29 July 1950 and concluded with his conviction on 16 November 1950. Gasc was found guilty of not yielding the right of way, and his speed was considered too high. It was ruled that as a consequence of not observing the law, he involuntarily caused the death of Schnaufer.|$|E
5|$|The case arose when a Minnesota county taxed an Indian's {{mobile home}} {{located on the}} reservation. The Court ruled that the state {{did not have the}} {{authority}} to impose such a tax or, more generally, to regulate behavior on the reservation. Bryan has become a landmark case that has led to Indian gaming on reservations and altered the economic status of almost every Indian tribe. Later decisions, citing Bryan, ruled that Public Law 280 allows states to enact prohibitions, or crimes, that would apply on reservations, but could not impose regulations on conduct that was otherwise allowed. The case has also called into question the ability of the states to impose any sort of regulations on tribal reservations, such as labor standards and certain <b>traffic</b> <b>regulations.</b>|$|E

It was stated that improved traffic flows would make London more attractive to business investment. Substantial net revenues were anticipated, which were to be invested in London's transport system. It also states that 90% of those who responded to a consultation on the scheme, viewed reducing traffic congestion in central London as 'important'.|$|E

40|$|The focuses of {{this paper}} are optimal <b>traffic</b> <b>regulation</b> after a major {{disaster}} and evaluation of capacity reliability of a network. The paper firstly discusses the context of <b>traffic</b> <b>regulation</b> and its importance after a major disaster. Then, this problem is formulated as an optimisation program in which the traffic regulator attempts to regulate the amount of traffic movements or access to some areas so as to maximise the traffic volumes in the network while (a) link flows must be less than link capacities and (b) re-routing effect due to changes of traffic condition in the network is allowed. The re-routing behaviour is assumed to follow Probit Stochastic User's Equilibrium (SUE). The paper explains an optimisation algorithm based on an implicit programming approach for solving this problem with the SUE condition. With this optimisation problem, the randomness of the link capacities (to represent random effects of the disaster) is introduced and the paper describes an approach to approximate the capacity reliability of the network using Monte-Carlo simulation. The paper then adopts this approach to evaluate the performances of different <b>traffic</b> <b>regulation</b> policies with a small network and a test network of Kobe city in Japan.

40|$|Abstract: As {{they involve}} many {{interacting}} agents behaving in numerous {{ways that are}} extremely difficult to predict, urban transportation systems are complex in nature. The development of intermodal passenger transportation solutions to address the mo-bility issues constitutes a major thrust area of urban transport policies. But, to offer citizens comprehensive seamless mobility, intermodal transportation system manage-ment (ITSM) requires the integration of two major components. The <b>traffic</b> <b>regulation</b> support system, to help the operator responsible for the regulation tasks: coordina-tion of timetables, synchronising arrival and departure times between the different transportation modes, and the traveller information system, giving customers access to information and using a comprehensive set of information tools. In this paper, a generic model of a transport management system, integrating these two components is proposed. This generic model is then used to elaborate a <b>traffic</b> <b>regulation</b> system {{in the case of}} a bimodal transportation system (tram-bus). The <b>traffic</b> <b>regulation</b> sup-port system, based on the decision model of an operator, and the traveler information system are described...|$|R
