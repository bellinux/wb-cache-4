50|$|To {{counter the}} danger of bullet splash or {{fragments}} knocked off {{the inside of the}} hull, crews were issued with leather-and-chainmail masks. A leather helmet was also issued, to protect the head against projections inside the <b>tank.</b> <b>Gas</b> masks were standard issue as well, as they were to all soldiers {{at this point in the}} war (see Chemical warfare). The side armour of 8 mm initially made them largely immune to small arms fire, but could be penetrated by the recently developed armour-piercing K bullets. There was also {{the danger of}} being overrun by infantry and attacked with grenades. The next generation had thicker armour, making them nearly immune to the K bullets. In response, the Germans developed the 13.2 mm Mauser anti-tank rifle, and also a Geballte Ladung ("Bunched Charge") - several stick grenades bundled together for a much bigger explosion.|$|E

A pilot-scale {{experimental}} {{system of}} filling gasoline into a tank {{was built to}} investigate gasoline vapor-air mass transfer in the <b>tank</b> <b>gas</b> space and the vapor evaporation loss from the tank in different operating conditions. The {{results showed that the}} higher the location of filling pipe exit inside the tank, the quicker the speed of the filling gasoline, and the higher the initial vapor concentration in the <b>tank</b> <b>gas</b> space, then the more severe the vapor-air convective transport and the larger the gasoline evaporation loss rates...|$|E

40|$|The {{waste tank}} purge {{ventilation}} system for Tank 48 {{is designed to}} prevent dangerous concentrations of hydrogen or benzene from accumulating in the gas space of the tank. Fans pull the gas/water vapor mixture from the <b>tank</b> <b>gas</b> space and pass it sequentially through a demister, a condenser, a reheater, and HEPA filters before discharging to the environment. Proper operation of the HEPA filters requires that the gas mixture passing through them has a low relative humidity. The ventilation system has been modified by increasing {{the capacity of the}} fans and changing the condenser from a two-pass heat exchanger to a single-pass heat exchanger. It is important to understand the impact of these modifications on the operation of the system. A hydraulic model of the ventilation exhaust system has been developed. This model predicts the properties of the air throughout the system and the flowrate through the system, as functions of the <b>tank</b> <b>gas</b> space and environmental conditions. This document serves as a Software Design Report, a Software Coding report, and a User`s Manual. All of the information required for understanding and using this code is herein contained: the governing equations are fully developed, the numerical algorithms are described in detail, and an extensively commented code listing is included. This updated version of the code models the entire purge ventilation system, and is therefore more general in its potential applications...|$|E

40|$|Helium {{evolution}} from {{the transfer of}} helium-saturated propellant in space is quantified to assess its impacts from creating two-phase gas/liquid flow from the supply <b>tank,</b> <b>gas</b> injection into the receiving tank, and liquid discharge from the receiving tank. Propellant transfer takes place between two similar tanks whose maximum storage capacity is approximately 2. 55 cubic meters each. The maximum on-orbit propellants transfer capability is 9000 lbm (fuel and oxidizer). The transfer line is approximately 1. 27 cm in diameter and 6096 cm in length and comprised of the fluid interconnect system (FICS), the orbiter propellant transfer system (OPTS), and the International Space Station (ISS) propulsion module (ISSPM). The propellant transfer rate begins at approximately 11 liter per minute (lpm) and subsequently drops to approximately 0. 5 lpm. The tank nominal operating pressure is approximately 1827 kPa (absolute). The line pressure drops for Monomethy 1 hydrazine (MMH) and Nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) at 11. 3 lpm are approximately 202 kPa and 302 kPa, respectively. The pressure-drop results {{are based on a}} single-phase flow. The receiving tank is required to vent from approximately 1827 kPa to a lower pressure to affect propellant transfer. These pressure-drop scenarios cause the helium-saturated propellants to release excess helium. For tank ullage venting, the maximum volumes of helium evolved at tank pressure are approximately 0. 5 ft 3 for MMH and 2 ft 3 for NTO. In microgravity environment, due to lack of body force, the helium {{evolution from}} a liquid body acts to propel it, which influences its fluid dynamics. For propellant transfer, the volume fractions of helium evolved at line pressure are 0. 1 % by volume for MMH and 0. 6 % by volume for NTO at 11. 3 lpm. The void fraction of helium evolved varies as an approximate second order power function of flow rate...|$|E
40|$|Space Station and {{satellite}} reservicing {{will require the}} ability to vent gas on orbit from liquid supply or storage tanks and to gage liquid quantity under microgravity conditions. In zero gravity, (zero-g) the vortex vent is capable of venting gas from a tank of liquid containing gas randomly distributed as bubbles. The concept uses a spinning impeller to create centrifugal force inside a vortex tube within a tank. This creates a gas pocket and forces the liquid through a venturi {{and back into the}} <b>tank.</b> <b>Gas</b> is then vented from the gas pocket through a liquid detector and then out through an exhaust port. If the liquid detector senses liquid in the vent line, the fluid is directed to the low-pressure port on the venturi and is returned to the tank. The advantages of this system is that it has no rotating seals and is compatible with most corrosive and cryogenic fluids. A prototype was designed and built at the NASA Johnson Space Center and flown on the KC- 135 zero-g aircraft. During these test flights, where microgravity conditions are obtained for up to 30 sec, the prototype demonstrated that less than 0. 10 percent of the volume of fluid vented was liquid when the tank was half full of liquid. The pressure volume temperature (PVT) gaging system is used in conjunction with the vortex vent to calculate the amount of liquid remaining in a tank under microgravity conditions. The PVT gaging system is used in conjunction with the vortex vent to gage liquid quantity in zero or low gravity. The system consists of a gas compressor, accumulator, and temperature and pressure instrumentation. To measure the liquid in a tank a small amount of gas is vented from the tank to the compressor and compressed into the accumulator. Pressure and temperature in the tank and accumulator are measured before and after the gas transfer occurs. Knowing the total volume of the tank, the volume of the accumulator, the volume of the intermediate lines, and initial and final pressures and temperatures, the mass of the gas leaving the tank is equated to the mass of the gas entering the accumulator. The volume of liquid remaining in the tank is calculated using the ideal gas law...|$|E
