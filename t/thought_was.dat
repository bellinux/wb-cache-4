5|$|Amanita australis is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Amanitaceae. It is found only in New Zealand, where it occurs in Leptospermum and Nothofagus forest. The species was first {{described}} by New Zealand mycologist Greta Stevenson in 1962; in the same publication Stevenson also described what she <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> a unique species, Limacella macrospora, but over 30 years later this was reduced to synonymy with A.australis.|$|E
5|$|Balcon {{disliked the}} film and his initial <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> to cut its running time down to an hour and {{classify}} it as a second feature. He did not provide Mackendrick with another directoral role, but assigned him to second unit work. Another of Ealing's directors, Charles Crichton, added additional footage at Ealing Studios and re-edited the film; this version was the one released into cinemas.|$|E

50|$|The {{power of}} <b>Thought</b> <b>is</b> not self-created. <b>Thought</b> <b>is</b> a divine gift, which serves you {{immediately}} after you <b>are</b> born. <b>Thought</b> <b>is</b> the creative agent {{we use to}} direct us through life.|$|R
60|$|Our first <b>thoughts</b> <b>are</b> the <b>thoughts</b> that <b>are</b> {{given to}} us; our second <b>thoughts</b> <b>are</b> the <b>thoughts</b> {{that we make}} for ourselves. I prefer to trust to the former.|$|R

5|$|Critical {{reception}} of Curse of Enchantia was mostly positive, especially {{in regard to}} its graphics and animation. However, the game was derided by some for its confusing user interface system, often illogical puzzle solutions and what some reviewers <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> a lack of quality humor, plot development and atmosphere, attributing it {{to the absence of}} text and dialogue.|$|E
5|$|In February 2014, Carrick {{was criticized}} by former club captain Roy Keane for what Keane <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> a poor interview. Although {{he made a}} total of 42 {{appearances}} in all competitions that season, there was speculation over whether Carrick had a future at Manchester United.|$|E
5|$|In Waters v. Churchill (1994), the Court {{was faced}} with two differing {{accounts}} of the speech at issue. The question presented to the Court was whether the Connick test ought be applied to what the employer <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> said or what was actually said. The case revolved around a nurse dismissed for a conversation she had with a coworker. There was a discrepancy between what she argued was said and what her employer <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> said. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, joined by a plurality of justices, opined that the Connick test must {{be applied to the}} speech the employer thought occurred, and on which it acted, rather than that which the finder of fact determines did occur.|$|E
40|$|The {{notion of}} logical <b>thought</b> has <b>been</b> {{discussed}} since time known to rational mind {{but the notion}} of illogical <b>thought</b> <b>be</b> possible <b>is</b> rarely <b>thought</b> and in this paper, there is an attempt made to understand the notion of illogical thought by asking whether illogical <b>thought</b> <b>be</b> possible or not, {{and if it is}} not, why it is not and if it is yes, then how can it be. The paper comprises of two parts i,e. (i) Illogical <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> impossible. Why it is so? – Early Wittgenstein’s reply and (ii) Illogical <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> possible. How can it be? -Criticism to Early Wittgenstein...|$|R

5|$|In casting, Nancy Cartwright {{originally}} planned {{to audition for}} the role of Lisa, while Yeardley Smith tried out for Bart. Smith's voice was too high for a boy, so she was given the role of Lisa. Cartwright found that Lisa was not interesting at the time, so instead auditioned for Bart, which she <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> a better role.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} as Gomphidius vinicolor in 1898 by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck, based on specimens collected near Lake Mohonk in Ulster County, New York. Peck noted a resemblance to Gomphidius roseus, which he <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> closely related. It {{was transferred to}} the newly created genus Chroogomphus by Orson K. Miller, Jr. in 1964.|$|E
5|$|To further {{add to his}} confusion, he {{encountered}} a series of islands north of Abaco Island, which looks {{very similar to the}} Key West Islands. The control tower then suggested that Taylor's team should fly west, which would have taken them to the landmass of Florida eventually. Taylor headed for what he <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> west, but in reality was northwest, almost parallel to Florida.|$|E
60|$|If all <b>thought</b> <b>were</b> audible none {{would be}} deemed discreditable. We know, indeed, that bad <b>thoughts</b> <b>are</b> universal, {{but that is}} not the same thing as {{catching}} them at being so.|$|R

5000|$|The idea {{represented}} in the title—that <b>thoughts</b> <b>are</b> free—was expressed as early as in antiquity and became prominent again in the Middle Ages, when Walther von der Vogelweide (c.1170-1230) wrote: [...] ("yet still <b>thoughts</b> <b>are</b> free"). In the 12th century, Austrian minnesinger Dietmar von Aist (presumably) had composed the song [...] ("only <b>thoughts</b> <b>are</b> free"). About 1229, Freidank wrote: [...] ("this band may no one twine, that will my thoughts confine").|$|R

5|$|After D-Day, a {{new role}} was found for Hargest. Now that the Allies were on {{mainland}} Europe, <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> turning {{to the issue of}} dealing with the expected arrival of newly released New Zealanders from liberated prisoner of war camps. The 2NZEF Reception Group was set up to help repatriate them. Hargest was appointed the commander of the group but on 12 August 1944, was killed by shell fire during the Battle of Normandy, when he was making a farewell visit to the British 50th Division. Hargest is buried at the Hottot-les-Bagues War Cemetery in France.|$|E
5|$|Around 02:45, several British destroyers {{mounted a}} torpedo {{attack against the}} rear half of the German line. Markgraf {{initially}} held her fire as {{the identities of the}} destroyers were unknown. But gunners aboard Grosser Kurfürst correctly identified the vessels as hostile and opened fire while turning away to avoid torpedoes, which prompted Markgraf to follow suit. Heavy fire from the German battleships forced the British destroyers to withdraw. At 05:06, Markgraf and several other battleships fired at what they <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> a submarine.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{the nurse}} moaned like a snow wind. [...] "Alas!"

5|$|At {{the early}} stages of development, Minagawa {{revealed}} that numerous ideas and features were planned for the game, but were dropped from the final stages due to certain constraints and hardware limitations. Some of these included the ability for a second player to join in the gameplay, enabling a two-player mode. Another idea that was given a considerable amount of <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> the ability to recruit non-player characters to join in the mob hunts. Due to the technical limitations of the console and multiple number of characters joining the fray, the development phase took longer than expected, causing delays.|$|E
5|$|Between 1800 and 1814, a dog named Barry {{lived as}} a rescue dog at the hospice, and was famous enough {{at the time}} for his body to be {{preserved}} at the Natural History Museum of Bern. However, during the preservation, the taxidermist {{and the director of}} the Museum agreed to modify the body towards what they <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> a good example of the breed during that period. The head itself was further modified in 1923 to represent the Saint Bernard of that era. Prior to this the skull was a great deal flatter with a moderate stop.|$|E
5|$|Crowley's <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> {{not always}} cohesive, and was {{influenced}} {{by a variety of}} sources, ranging from eastern religious movements and practices like Hindu yoga and Buddhism, scientific naturalism, and various currents within Western esotericism, among them ceremonial magic, alchemy, astrology, Rosicrucianism, Kabbalah, and the Tarot. He was steeped in the esoteric teachings he had learned from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, although pushed further with his own interpretations and strategies than the Golden Dawn had done. Crowley incorporated concepts and terminology from South Asian religious traditions like yoga and Tantra into his Thelemic system, believing that there was a fundamental underlying resemblance between Western and Eastern spiritual systems.|$|E
50|$|Deleuze's {{alternate}} {{image of}} <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> based on difference, which creates a dynamism that traverses individual faculties and conceptions. This <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> fundamentally energetic and asignifying: if it produces propositions, these are wholly secondary to its development.|$|R

5|$|Despite the Cathedral's {{reaction}} to {{its use in}} Resistance: Fall of Man, the controversy {{has resulted in a}} significant increase in its visitor numbers according to David Marshall, director of communications for the Diocese of Manchester, writing in the Official PlayStation Magazine. Teachers tell him that teenagers in particular are interested to see a building which they <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> fictional. He adds that tourism has increased since the broadcast of pictures taken inside the Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Frequent {{and often}} {{contradictory}} directives were issued by Reich Minister of the Interior Wilhelm Frick, Bernhard Rust of the Reichserziehungsministerium (Ministry of Education) {{and various other}} agencies regarding content of lessons and acceptable textbooks for use in primary and secondary schools. Books deemed unacceptable to the regime were removed from school libraries. Indoctrination in National Socialist <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> made compulsory in January 1934. Students selected as future members of the party elite were indoctrinated {{from the age of}} 12 at Adolf Hitler Schools for primary education and National Political Institutes of Education for secondary education. Detailed National Socialist indoctrination of future holders of elite military rank was undertaken at Order Castles.|$|E
5|$|In 1899 Gaudí {{joined the}} Cercle Artístic de Sant Lluc (Saint Luke artistic circle), a Catholic artistic society founded in 1893 by the bishop Josep Torras i Bages and the {{brothers}} Josep and Joan Llimona. He also joined the Lliga Espiritual de la Mare de Déu de Montserrat (spiritual league of Our lady of Montserrat), another Catholic Catalan organisation. The conservative and religious character {{of his political}} <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> closely linked to his defence of the cultural identity of the Catalan people.|$|E
50|$|Exploratory <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> an {{academic}} term {{used in the}} field of psychology to describe reasoning that neutrally considers multiple points of view and tries to anticipate all possible objections to, or flaws in, a particular position, with the goal of seeking truth. The opposite of exploratory <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> confirmatory <b>thought,</b> which <b>is</b> reasoning designed to construct justification supporting a specific point of view.|$|R
50|$|To analyse {{whether a}} {{relative}} clause is restrictive or non-restrictive a simple test can be applied: If the basic {{meaning of the}} sentence (the <b>thought)</b> <b>is</b> not changed by removing the relative clause, the relative clause is not essential to the basic <b>thought</b> and <b>is</b> non-restrictive. But if the essential meaning of the <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> disturbed, the relative clause is restrictive.|$|R
