But also I feel like <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be stakes. This year was filled with foreboding of violence and death, and the connection of that early summer between the riots, which resulted in death, police killing innocent people, and the Richard Speck murders and the guy on the Texas tower [...] The randomness and the nihilism that was born from that was something that permeated the story. Lane's story I thought was about someone who has undervalued themselves and that was his only way out, he thought." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{conduction}} {{of nerve}} impulses {{is an example}} of an all-or-none response. In other words, if a neuron responds at all, then it must respond completely. Greater intensity of stimulation does not produce a stronger signal but can produce a higher frequency of firing. There are different types of receptor responses to stimuli, slowly adapting or tonic receptors respond to steady stimulus and produce a steady rate of firing. These tonic receptors most often respond to increased intensity of stimulus by increasing their firing frequency, usually as a power function of stimulus plotted against impulses per second. This can be likened to an intrinsic property of light where to get greater intensity of a specific frequency (color) <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be more photons, as the photons can't become [...] "stronger" [...] for a specific frequency.|$|E
2500|$|A Jerusalem Post {{editorial}} {{expressed concern}} regarding the individuals invited {{to speak to}} the J Street February 2011 conference.

Israeli Members of Knesset were among those who voiced concern. [...] "I have my own criticism of the current government, but <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be limits, and this organization is doing tremendous damage to Israel," [...] said Kadima MK Ze'ev Bielski, a former Jewish Agency chairman. At the same time, other MK attended and spoke at the conference, including Daniel Ben-Simon (Labor), Yoel Hasson (Kadima), Amir Peretz (Labor), Nachman Shai (Kadima), and Orit Zuaretz (Kadima).|$|E

2500|$|Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon list several {{disadvantages}} {{of the union}} organizing model, with the most critical being that the model is very [...] "resource-intensive," [...] {{in terms of both}} people and money. Since the organizing model is, at its core, about people, rather than services, it cannot be effective without people to both implement it and carry it out. Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon talk about [...] "...instances of a lack of support or even opposition to organizing within unions." [...] Because the organizing model is so dependent upon worker motivation and action, if the workers themselves oppose the implementation of the organizing model, it cannot be effective. Fletcher and Hurd suggest that even if members are not resistant to adoption of the organizing model, they still {{have to learn how to}} perform tasks previously handled by organizers, and <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be enough active members to facilitate this kind of action. This clear dependence on the support and actions of the workers is a disadvantage of the organizing model, as opposed to the servicing model, which, for the most part, does not require worker support or demand worker action. According to Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon, [...] "Employers are often resistant." [...] Unions that have to deal with this problem would very clearly have a hard time using the organizing model, as it could antagonize the employer even further and erode any previously existing relationship between the employer and the union.|$|E

6000|$|Or {{coming into}} lower, less unspeakable provinces, {{is not all}} Loyalty akin to {{religious}} Faith also? Faith is loyalty to some inspired Teacher, some spiritual Hero. And what therefore is loyalty proper, the life-breath of all society, but an effluence of Hero-worship, submissive admiration for the truly great? Society is founded on Hero-worship. All dignities of rank, on which human association rests, are what we may call a Heroarchy (Government of Heroes),--or a Hierarchy, for it is [...] "sacred" [...] enough withal! The Duke means Dux, Leader; King is Kon-ning, Kan-ning, Man that knows or cans. Society everywhere is some representation, not insupportably inaccurate, of a graduated Worship of Heroes--reverence and obedience done to men really great and wise. Not insupportably inaccurate, I say! They are all as bank-notes, these social dignitaries, all representing gold;--and several of them, alas, always are forged notes. We can do with some forged false notes; with a good many even; but not with all, or the most of them forged!

60|$|Turk's Island {{is a low}} key {{composed}} of sand and rocks, and lying north and south, less than two leagues in extent. It is utterly destitute of wood, and has not a single tree of native growth. It has no fresh water, the inhabitants depending entirely on cisterns and casks in which they preserve the rain; neither has it any lake, but several salt ponds, which furnish the sole production of the island. Turk's Island cannot be approached on the east or northeast side, in consequence of the reef that surrounds it. It has no harbor, but has an open road on the west side, which vessels at anchor <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> leave and put to sea whenever the wind comes from any other quarter {{than that of the}} usual trade breeze of N.E. which blows over the island; for the shore is so bold that there is no anchorage except close to it; and when the wind ceases to blow from the laud, vessels remaining at their anchors would be swung against the rocks, or forced high upon the shore, by the terrible surf that then prevails. The unfrequented road of the Hawk's Nest, {{at the south end of}} the island, is even more dangerous. This island, which is not susceptible of the slightest cultivation, furnishes a scanty subsistence to a few sheep and horses. The inhabitants draw all their consumption from abroad, with the exception of fish and turtle, which are taken in abundance, and supply the principal food of the slaves employed in the salt-works. The whole wealth of the island consists in the produce of the salt-ponds, and in the salvage and plunder of the many wrecks which take place in the neighborhood. Turk's Island, therefore, would never be inhabited in a savage state of society, where commerce does not exist, and where men are obliged to draw their subsistence from the spot which they people.|$|E
