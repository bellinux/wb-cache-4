The choice of the record's B-side was not by Rose, but by an MGM office boy. MGM indicated they wanted to put the record on the market quickly. A B-side was needed and with Rose away, the office boy went through some of Rose's <b>tapes</b> <b>searching</b> for one. [...] "The Stripper" [...] featured especially prominent trombone lines, giving the tune its lascivious signature, and evokes the feel of music used to accompany burlesque striptease artists. The piece features in the films Slap Shot, The Full Monty and Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit as well as TV series Little Britain and Scrubs. It was also famously used in a parody by British comedy duo Morecambe and Wise, where they danced to the tune while making breakfast.|$|R

50|$|Their first album, The Jayhawks, was {{released}} by Bunkhouse Records, a small independent label, in 1986. Their music at the time, mostly written by Olson, showed a strong roots/country rock influence. Rogers left {{and was replaced by}} Thad Spencer, and the band worked for the next years on demo <b>tapes</b> in <b>search</b> of a major label recording contract. During this period, Louris left the band briefly (following a car accident) and Dan Gaarder replaced him. Louris returned, and the collected demos from 1986 to 1989 were brought together to create Blue Earth, released on the Minneapolis label Twin Tone in 1989. On this album Louris shared more of the songwriting with Olson. After touring the U.S. in support of Blue Earth, Spencer left the band and was replaced in 1988 by Ken Callahan, who stayed with the band until 1993.|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{experimental}} seismic arrays {{have been constructed}} {{in the past few}} years. One such array {{in the form of an}} asymmetric linear cross has been built a t Yellowknife, NWT, by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority in collaboration with the Canadian Department of Mines and Technical Surveys. Data from the 19 individual seismometers are recorded continuously on FM magnetic tape. The analogue tape data are multiplexed into a digital computer at twice the recording speed. The system allows the formation of 168 beams by the delay and sum method: different approaches to this problem and their implications for real time processing are discussed. The correlations between the phased sums of the two lines are calculated and events are detected automatically when the correlation rises above a trigger level for a preset length of time. For each event a selection of logarithmic correlations is output in analogue form, together with other pertinent information. The recorded data have been analysed in two modes: free search, in which the entire <b>tape</b> is <b>searched</b> by the computer; and selective search fine scan, in which events are selected visually from a helicorder record and subjected to a variety of search procedures. A 30 -day free search experiment indicated that the 50 % detection probability level is m 4. 1 kO. 2. The location accuracy of the events detected during the 30 -day experiment is of the order of 300 km in latitude and longitude and fine scan experiments have shown that this accuracy may be improved. The signaI/noise ratio improvement is close to the theoretical value. 1...|$|R

The coder output {{which is to be}} recorded serially on one channel of a frequency modulated tape recorder {{is in the form of}} four digit, binary-coded-decimal numbers in which the binary bit " 0 " is represented by a voltage level of + 1 volt and the binary bit " 1 " is represented by + 2 volts. The code word nuMbers are generated sequentially from the number 0 to the number 9999. When a code word number is to be sought at a later time in the decoding operation, the output of the tape recorder is connected to the input of the decoder and the <b>tape</b> is then <b>searched.</b> When the decoder senses the code word which is present on the dials of a Digiswitch, a relay is closed in order to perform other desired operations such as the copying of the data at any particular point of the original coded tape onto other tapes.

40|$|Creative Intuition {{can be said}} to be the {{motivating}} {{force behind}} the compositional act. To harness it the composer must develop those musical resources which allow him to deal with inspiration, when it comes, as well as developing the techniques to elaborate upon the inspiration received and remain true to his original vision. In this compositional folio, I have tried to highlight different ways in which I as a composer deal with musical inspiration and the development of musical ideas. For this purpose, I begin by considering the moment in time in which I have had to write the pieces included in this folio, and its impact upon my musical practice. In order to introduce my approach to sound creation, I have included a brief section on timbre creation as composition, here I revise some fundamental concepts and examine the general types of sound used and the methods of synthesis at my disposal. In considering intuition and musical association, I discuss improvisation as a compositional act. In Son del Seis, I am concerned with the composer's improvisation at his instrument and how this influences his writing; In Salta Mortal, I examine improvisation at the computer keyboard, and how it is possible, given the software facilities we have today, to operate directly upon the sounds themselves, and organize them musically, in particular I look at my approach to phrase construction with timbral gestures; In Viaje I combine the instrumental and computer improvisational approaches, dealing with pitched timbral gestures within the harmonic framework of modal jazz. The compositional manipulation of time in electroacoustic music could be seen to present different challenges to the composer than those of traditional acoustic music. In considering the poetics of time in electroacoustic music I have used Sin Ti Par EI Alma Adentro {{as a starting point for}} my discussion. In my view, setting words to music presents the composer with an opportunity to impress his own reading of the text material upon the listener, in Sin Medida, I discuss my choices in musically illustrating the three poems used. From the composition of all the pieces in this folio and my speculative explanations, I arrive at a number of concluding ideas and briefly state their relevance to my work: composition away from the traditional manuscript pad; the creative manipulation of timbre using synthesizers and samplers; the establishing of notational conventions for the representation of <b>tape</b> parts; the <b>search</b> for a compositional voice that would express my musical mind specifically in regards to integrating 'non -classical' idioms and electroacoustic sounds. In the appendix I have included my summary of a neo-thomistic notion of art, proposed by J. Maritain, to illustrate the philosophical grounds for my compositional work...|$|R
