She mustn't be taken, for her first happy holiday, to visit her late godfather's tomb--as would certainly be the case were I to lend myself to the fond anachronism her too rosy-visioned parents so flatteringly propose. You see, dear Wilfred, I speak from a wealth of wisdom and experience--life has made me rather exceptionally acquainted with the godpaternal function (so successful an impostor would I seem to have been,) and it was long since brought home {{to me that the}} character takes more wearing and its duties more performing than I feel I have ever been able to give it. I have three godchildren living (for to some I have been fatal)--two daughters and a son; and my conscience tells me that I have long grossly neglected them. They write me--at considerable length sometimes, and I just remember that I have one of their last sweet appeals still unanswered. This, dear Clare and dear Wilfred, is purely veracious history--a dark chapter in my life. Let me not add another--let me show at last a decent compunction. Let me not offer up a helpless and unconscious little career on the altar of my incompetence. Frankly, the lovely child should find at her font a younger and braver and nimbler presence, one that shall go on with her longer and become accessible to her personal knowledge. You will feel this together on easier reflection--just as you will see how my plea {{goes hand in hand with}} my deep appreciation of your exquisite confidence.|$|E

Traditional leakage optimization strategies either assume the prespecification of thresh-hold values or are good only for two <b>threshholds.</b> The presented formulation is based on linear programming approach under the piecewise linear approximation of delay/leakage vs thresh-hold curves.

An algorithm, based on the ratio of NDVI to annual maximum NDVI for each pixel, was used to represent percent of maximum greenness for each composite period. Greenup and senescence commenced when NDVI values rose above and fell below a selected percent of maximum greenness. Six different percent of maximum greenness <b>threshholds,</b> ranging from 25 to 50 percent, were evaluated. This algorithm eliminates complications of landscape-specific NDVI thresholds and year-to-year variability. The algorithm was tested against 1) air temperature data from 23 weather stations located in northern Alaska from 1991 to 1997, 2) observed greenup at two sites in Fairbanks, Alaska, from 1991 to 1997, and 3) phenology observations on the Seward Peninsula during the 1996 - 1997 growing seasons.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the initial stages}} of a multi-phase collaborative effort underway between IIASA's Forestry Project and the Center of Aerospace Research of the Earth (CASRE). The main goal of this effort is to develop a procedure for the retrieval of forest inventory information across Siberia, Russia. Due to the great size of the area, satellite data may play an important role. We are currently investigating the application of a multi-sensor approach, whereby a combination of high and low resolution sensors is used to achieve results. Initial efforts have focused on the classification of high-resolution Landsat images with the aid of GIS ground-truth data. In addition, a brief analysis was made of SPOT Vegetation data over the study site. The interaction between the detailed GIS data, the high-resolution Landsat data, and the course resolution SPOT Vegetation data was explored. It appears difficult at present to merge these various datasets in a meaningful way. It will be necessary to incorporate other sensors, possibly those of a moderate resolution in order to tackle the problem. One additional area of investigation begun here was the possible identification of different types of disturbances, in particular, damage from pests. At this stage, it appears that the interpretation of a classified Landsat image after <b>threshholding</b> allows for the identification of forests affected by the Siberian moth...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To study {{relations}} between cryosectioning work, skin temperature, {{early signs of}} neuropathy in the hands, and vasospastic and neurological symptoms. Microtome work is carried out at histological and toxicological laboratories all over the world. It implicates local cold exposure of - 20 degrees C on the hands of exposed laboratory technicians. METHODS: Thirty nine laboratory technicians who use microtomes at the preclinical and clinical laboratories at the University of Uppsala, Sweden were studied. An equal number of nonexposed laboratory technicians served as controls, matched for workplace, sex, age, and smoking habits. Information on symptoms, type of work, and personal factors were assessed {{by means of a}} self administered questionnaire. Two point discrimination ability was tested, and vibration perception <b>threshholds</b> were measured for both hands by a bio-thesiometer. Also, skin temperature was measured during cryosectioning work in those 15 technicians performing cryosectioning work during the study period. RESULTS: Most laboratory technicians did not use any gloves during cryosectioning work, and direct contact with frozen materials sometimes occurred and resulted in a rapid cooling of the skin. In six of 15 exposed subjects (40 %), the mean skin temperature during microtome work was below 20 degrees C. A later rise in skin temperature, due to a compensatory vasodilation, was found in two subjects. The group exposed to cold had signs of early neuropathy on the right hand, indicated both by vibrametry and two point discrimination test. Significant work related differences in clinical signs within the group exposed to cold was also found. No differences between exposed and nonexposed people were found for symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon, numbness, or musculosceletal complaints. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that cryosectioning laboratory work may cause adverse health effects [...] for example, peripheral neuropathy [...] and measures should be taken to protect the hands from the local cold exposure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background One {{approach}} for speeding-up protein structure comparison is the projection approach, where a protein structure is mapped to a high-dimensional vector and structural similarity is approximated by {{distance between the}} corresponding vectors. Structural footprinting methods are projection methods that employ the same general technique to produce the mapping: first select a representative set of structural fragments as models and then map a protein structure to a vector in which each dimension corresponds to a particular model and "counts" {{the number of times}} the model appears in the structure. The main difference between any two structural footprinting methods is in the set of models they use; in fact a large number of methods can be generated by varying the type of structural fragments used and the amount of detail in their representation. How do these choices affect the ability of the method to detect various types of structural similarity? Results To answer this question we benchmarked three structural footprinting methods that vary significantly in their selection of models against the CATH database. In the first set of experiments we compared the methods' ability to detect structural similarity characteristic of evolutionarily related structures, i. e., structures within the same CATH superfamily. In the second set of experiments we tested the methods' agreement with the boundaries imposed by classification groups at the Class, Architecture, and Fold levels of the CATH hierarchy. Conclusion In both experiments we found that the method which uses secondary structure information has the best performance on average, but no one method performs consistently the best across all groups at a given classification level. We also found that combining the methods' outputs significantly improves the performance. Moreover, our new techniques to measure and visualize the methods' agreement with the CATH hierarchy, including the <b>threshholded</b> affinity graph, are useful beyond this work. In particular, they can be used to expose a similar composition of different classification groups in terms of structural fragments used by the method and thus provide an alternative demonstration of the continuous nature of the protein structure universe. </p...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the computational requirements for all-sky, all-frequency searches for gravitational waves from spinning neutron stars, using archived data from interferometric gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO. These sources {{are expected to}} be weak, so the optimal strategy involves coherent accumulaton of signal-to-noise using Fourier transforms of long stretches of data (months to years). Earth-motion-induced Doppler shifts, and intrinsic pulsar spindown, will reduce the narrow-band signal-to-noise by spreading power across many frequency bins; therefore, it is necessary to correct for these effects before performing the Fourier transform. The corrections can be implemented by a parametrized model, in which one does a search over a discrete set of parameter values. We define a metric on this parameter space, which can be used to determine the optimal spacing between points in a search; the metric is used to compute the number of independent parameter-space points Np that must be searched, as a function of observation time T. The number Np(T) depends on the maximum gravitational wave frequency and the minimum spindown age tau=f/(df/dt) that the search can detect. The signal-to-noise ratio required, in order to have 99 % confidence of a detection, also depends on Np(T). We find that for an all-sky, all-frequency search lasting T= 10 ^ 7 s, this detection <b>threshhold</b> is at a level of 4 to 5 times h(3 /yr), where h(3 /yr) is the corresponding 99 % confidence <b>threshhold</b> if one knows in advance the pulsar position and spin period.
