5|$|Antibiotics have {{no effect}} against viral infections or against the viruses that cause the common cold. Due to their side effects, {{antibiotics}} cause overall harm but are still frequently prescribed. Some {{of the reasons that}} antibiotics are so commonly prescribed include people's expectations for them, physicians' desire <b>to</b> <b>help,</b> <b>and</b> the difficulty in excluding complications that may be amenable to antibiotics. There are no effective antiviral drugs for the common cold even though some preliminary research has shown benefits.|$|E

5|$|After 1963 Blyton's output was {{generally}} confined to {{short stories and}} books intended for very young readers, such as Learn to Count with Noddy and Learn to Tell Time with Noddy in 1965, and Stories for Bedtime and the Sunshine Picture Story Book collection in 1966. Her declining health and a falling off in readership among older children have been put forward as the principal reasons for this change in trend. Blyton published her last book in the Noddy series, Noddy and the Aeroplane, in February 1964. In May the following year she published Mixed Bag, a song book with music written by her nephew Carey, and in August she released her last full-length books, The Man Who Stopped <b>to</b> <b>Help</b> <b>and</b> The Boy Who Came Back.|$|E
5|$|During an {{engagement}} early in June 1915 Walpole single-handedly rescued a wounded soldier; his Russian comrades refused <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>and</b> Walpole carried {{one end of}} a stretcher and dragged the man to safety. For this he was awarded the Cross of Saint George; General Lechitsky presented him with the medal in August. After his tour of duty Walpole returned to Petrograd. Among the city's attractions for him was the presence of Konstantin Somov, a painter with whom he had formed a close relationship. He remained there until October 1915, when he returned to England. He visited his family, stayed with Percy Anderson in London, telephoned Henry James in Rye, and retreated to a cottage he had bought in Cornwall. In January 1916 he was asked by the Foreign Office to return to Petrograd. Russians were being subjected to highly effective German propaganda. The writer Arthur Ransome, Petrograd correspondent of The Daily News, had successfully lobbied {{for the establishment of a}} bureau to counter the German efforts, and the British ambassador, Sir George Buchanan, wanted Walpole to take charge.|$|E

Once again, Robbit is dispatched <b>to</b> <b>help,</b> <b>and</b> manages to free the parts of Little Muu which Kabuki has taken, and ultimately faces Kabuki one-on-one in mortal combat. Robbit defeats Kabuki, resulting in the latter escaping.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} his {{participation}} in the baronial reform movement, Gloucester still maintained {{the trust of the}} king. He, Gaveston and the Earl of Warenne were the only earls to accompany the king on a Scottish campaign in 1310–11. In March 1311, while the Ordinances were still in the workings, Gloucester was appointed guardian of the realm while the king was still in Scotland. There are signs that he might have fallen out with Thomas, Earl of Lancaster – who was at this point the leader of the opposition against the king – over a feud between two of their respective retainers. When Gaveston once more returned from exile, however, Gloucester sided with the baronial opposition. The earls divided the country into different parts for defence, and Gloucester was given charge of the south. In June 1312, Gaveston was captured by Guy de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, who was working in cooperation with Lancaster. Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, who had the custody of Gaveston and had guaranteed his safety to the king, appealed to Gloucester, as Gaveston's kinsman, for assistance. Gloucester, however, refused <b>to</b> <b>help,</b> <b>and</b> Gaveston was killed. This act brought the country to the brink of civil war, and Gloucester {{was one of the few}} men who was still trusted enough by both sides to be able to take on a role as mediator. In the following months, he was among the main negotiators working towards an agreement between the king and the offending earls, an effort that was at least temporarily successful.|$|E
5|$|While on a {{shopping}} {{trip to the}} Springfield Mall, Mr. Burns finds a penny in a water fountain and reaches in to grab it (fearing Ralph might take it) and falls in. The rushing water nearly drowns him, but Homer arrives and pulls {{him out of the}} water, saving Mr. Burns's life. To reward him, Mr. Burns offers to take Homer out to dinner. Homer says he likes Chicago deep dish pizza, so Mr. Burns takes him to Chicago on his private plane. On the plane, Homer is treated with luxury and gets serenaded by Lionel Richie. Homer has the time of his life in Chicago, but he becomes depressed on the return trip because he does not have the plane. Back in Springfield, Homer tells Marge that he is tired of being a normal person and becomes depressed. Marge, pitying for Homer, decides <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>and</b> hires him a life coach named Colby Kraus (Stephen Colbert), who will help with Homer's dream. Colby starts right away in his treatment with Homer by videotaping his every move. At the bowling alley and after watching Homer's daily habits for a few days, Colby realizes that bowling is the one thing Homer is good at and enjoys doing. He instructs Homer to wear his bowling shoes everywhere he goes to help instill confidence in everything he does. The bowling shoes work, Homer becomes a new man, and as a result he receives numerous new job offers. Homer decides to only go for an interview at Handyman's Choice Copper Tubing because he would be required to fly in the company jet as part of his new job, however, the Rich Texan does not hire him.|$|E
