There is a Cognitive Impairment major, and Emotional Impairment major, a Hearing Impairment major, a Speech/Language Pathology major, a Teacher of Students with Physical {{and other}} Health Impairment major, and a visual Impairment major. The CI (Cognitive Impaired) major qualifies {{one for a}} recommendation to the Michigan Department of Education for k-12 endorsement as a Teacher of Students with Cognitive Impairment. This particular program requires 151 hours worth of credits, which includes general education credit requirements from the University. The EI (Emotional Impairment) also qualifies one for a recommendation to the Michigan department of Education for k-12 endorsement as a Teacher of Students with Emotional Impairments. This program requires 136 hours worth of credits. HI, the Hearing Impairment program, qualifies one for a recommendation to the Michigan department of Education for k-12 endorsement as a Teacher of Students with Hearing Impairment. Eastern Michigan has been an approved center for training teachers of the hearing impaired since 1967. VI, the Visual Impairment program, qualifies one for a recommendation to the Michigan department of Education for k-12 endorsement as a <b>Teacher</b> <b>of</b> <b>Students</b> <b>with</b> <b>Visual</b> Impairment. Finally, the Speech/Language Pathology Major offered by the Department of Special Education of Eastern Michigan University is one a program that finishes with {{the completion of a}} master's degree.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the benefits of}} the team approach to teaching mathematics to elementary children with visual impairments in inclusive settings and offers strategies for classroom teachers and team teaching. Strategies for classroom teachers include: (1) avoiding the use of words such as "this", "that", and "there", that will be meaningless to a student with blindness; (2) ensuring that descriptions of problems or techniques are worded carefully to avoid ambiguity; (3) speaking everything that is written on the chalkboard and spelling new words while they are being written; (4) providing transparencies and notes for the <b>teacher</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> impairments to transcribe into braille for students to use at their desks; (5) when describing concepts through the use of everyday objects, choosing objects which a student with blindness is able to access readily and understand; (6) providing a print copy of textbooks and handouts to students with blindness to be used by a reader at home; (7) providing extra desk space for braille materials; (8) administering tests orally; (9) having a person who can read braille check mathematics assignments; and (10) forwarding assignments and answer keys to the <b>teacher</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> impairments in advance.

40|$|In 2000, {{contributors}} to the formulation of the National Plan for Training Personnel to Serve Children with Blindness and Low Vision anticipated a severe shortage of direct service personnel as early as 2006 with an increasing negative impact on teacher numbers {{through the end of}} the decade. It is necessary to attract approximately 5, 000 new teachers to the field to meet the needs of the ever-increasing population of students with visual impairments requiring specialized training. This study investigated the personality and background experiences of individuals who are attracted to work as educators with students with visual impairments. A sample of 132 teachers who had been trained at either the undergraduate or graduate level and were employed within their first five years as teachers with this specialization completed the Holland Self-Directed Search (Form CP) and a Participant Profile form to ascertain the personality types and experiences of those new to the field. The study considered three variables: (1) gender, (2) race/ethnicity, (3) teacher training level and their association with Holland personality type (RIASEC). All three variables were weak predictors of the personality type of teachers of the visually impaired as indicated by Goodman and Kruskal's tau.

40|$|Introduction: This study {{examined}} the everyday work <b>of</b> eight <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> visual impairments at governmental primary and secondary schools in Queensland, Australia. The small-scale study aimed to capture the scope {{and complexity of the}} activities <b>of</b> these <b>teachers</b> and the regular challenges they face in their expected everyday roles. Methods: Telephone interviews were used to collect descriptive data from the teachers. A direct field-sampling procedure was used across the governmental schools to recruit qualified and specialist teachers who met prespecified criteria, most of whom lived in Brisbane, Queensland's capital city. The content of the interviews was generated from two sequenced activities with a different group <b>of</b> experienced <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> visual impairments. Results: The teachers carried out complex and demanding duties as part of their everyday roles. These duties were consistent with those performed by their counterparts around the world. The most frequently performed and most important activities including providing direct support to students, advocating for students' needs, and collaborating across school and community contexts. The identified challenges were linked primarily to the lack of time to undertake important activities. Discussion: Three important and interconnected findings can be drawn from the results: role complexity, time and collaboration, and the importance of the expanded core curriculum. Implications for Practitioners: The findings provide an initial snapshot of the changing role reported by the teachers. Thus, these data offer a beginning point for future probes into the workplace knowledge and skills required by <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> visual impairments.

Little is known about reasons for these low frequencies. This article explores the literature {{to develop a new}} research agenda for approaching this issue. Method: Selected studies were reviewed, including qualitative studies involving <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> who use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) in mainstream classrooms. Results: Teachers identified a broad range of issues that influence their ability to educate students who use AAC or demonstrate other significant communication needs. These factors include teachers' attitudes, perceptions and beliefs and broader contextual factors, such as administrative support at the institutional level. However, to date, there has been little research <b>with</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> MSD about factors influencing communication <b>with</b> their <b>students.</b> Conclusions: A broad range of potential factors may impact upon teachers' ability to communicate <b>with</b> their <b>students.</b> Further research involving <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> MSD is needed to explore the range of potential factors influencing low frequencies of communication. This research may contribute to an understanding of how best to support teachers to enhance communication access for <b>students</b> <b>with</b> MSD in the classroom...|$|R

40|$|The {{pressure}} <b>of</b> being a <b>teacher</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> {{special needs}} could eventually drive teachers to burnout, {{a phenomenon that}} manifests itself in emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and feeling incapable of personal accomplishment. Burnout has physical and psychological symptoms and affects teachers‟ wellbeing and quality of work. In order to identify the causes and symptoms <b>of</b> <b>teacher</b> burnout, {{this study was conducted}} in 5 private schools in Beirut. A qualitative research approach and a multiplecase study design were followed. The instruments were the Mashlach Burnout Inventory- Educators Survey (MBI-ES) that 54 special education teachers responded to, a researcher‟s reflective journal, and semi-structured interviews with 5 Heads of special education departments and 5 <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> special needs. Qualitative and quantitative data analysis was conducted and credibility, trustworthiness and ethical practice were ensured. Findings indicate that Lebanese special education teachers experience high burnout on emotional exhaustion and low burnout on depersonalization and personal accomplishment caused by teaching conditions, minimal support, heavy workload, challenging students‟ behavior, teacher expectations not matching reality, role conflict and ambiguity, and lack <b>of</b> <b>teacher</b> training. Recommendations for dealing with burnout were highlighted. N/A 1 hard copy: x, 92 leaves; 31 cm. available at RNL. Bibliography : leaves 63 - 69...|$|R
40|$|This {{study had}} a {{two-fold}} purpose. The first {{purpose was to}} compare the rankings {{of a set of}} knowledge/skills statements as reported by <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> emotional behavioral disorders and teachers in juvenile correctional special education settings. A survey instrument designed to measure the importance, proficiency, and frequency of use of clusters of knowledge/skills statements was administered to 123 teachers in juvenile correctional special education settings in state institutions. Mann Whitney U analyses were calculated to compare the mean rankings of the two groups <b>of</b> <b>teachers.</b> The findings indicated that teachers in juvenile correctional special education settings and <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> emotional and behavioral disorders were very similar as to which knowledge/skills clusters were important to their job performance, which clusters they were most proficient at using, and which clusters they utilized most frequently. The second purpose was to compare the teachers in juvenile correctional special education settings and to determine whether their mean rankings of the knowledge/skills clusters varied when analyzed by differing categories of age, type of certification held, years of teaching experience, and level of the teachers' education. Analysis of variance revealed {{no significant difference in the}} mean rankings in any of the comparison groups. Therefore <b>teacher</b> age, level <b>of</b> education, type of certification held, or years of teaching experience yielded no significant differences on the mean rankings of the knowledge/skills clusters...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide an {{efficient}} transition program for parents and <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> autism spectrum disorders who are in the transition process from elementary to middle school and to suggest the necessity of parent-teacher partnership. To achieve this, data analysis according to the grounded theory was conducted after implementing in-depth interview and focus group interview targeting nine parents and three <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> autism spectrum disorders. Results of the study are as follows. Firstly, as for parent-teacher experiences, concepts such as difficulties in school life resulting from characteristics <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> autism spectrum disorder, successive transition process of worries, negative view of school life, concerns in the transitions to the middle school, experiences of personal life, strategy for the efficient transition, and preparation process for future were emerged. Secondly, as for the transition programs of elementary and secondary education for <b>students</b> <b>with</b> autism spectrum disorders, there are needs in professional transition counseling, transition education for students, parents, and teachers, liaison to NICE system, systematic diagnosis and placement, and making ITP at the elementary school level. Thirdly, as for parent-teacher partnership in the transition process <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>of</b> autism spectrum disorders, three types such as active cooperative relationship, passive cooperative relationship, and non-cooperative relationship were appeared based on the attention and cooperative attitude about transition. Lastly, conditional matrix at personal level, school level, and national leve...|$|R
