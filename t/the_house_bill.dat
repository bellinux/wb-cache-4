5|$|There are an {{increasing}} number of private health providers and, , 67.1% of healthcare came from private expenditures while 32.9% was from government. In 2013, total expenditures on the health sector was 3.8% of GDP, below the WHO target of 5%. Health expenditure represented about 6.1% of total government spending. Per capita total expenditure at average exchange rate was USD52. The budget allocation for Healthcare in 2010 was ₱28billion (about USD597million) or ₱310 ($7) per person but had an increase in budget in 2014 with a record high in the collection of taxes from <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Bill</b> 5727 (commonly known as Sin tax Bill).|$|E
5|$|In June 1844, the Senate, {{with its}} Whig majority, soundly {{rejected}} the Tyler–Texas treaty. The pro-annexation Democrat Polk narrowly defeated anti-annexation Whig Henry Clay in the 1844 presidential election. In December 1844, lame-duck President Tyler called on Congress to pass his treaty by simple majorities in each house. The Democratic-dominated House of Representatives complied with his request by passing an amended bill expanding on the pro-slavery {{provisions of the}} Tyler treaty. The Senate narrowly passed a compromise version of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>bill</b> (by the vote of the minority Democrats and several southern Whigs), designed to provide the incoming President-elect Polk the options of immediate annexation of Texas or new talks to revise the annexation terms of the House-amended bill.|$|E
5|$|In the 1892 election, South Carolinians {{passed a}} {{non-binding}} referendum calling for prohibition. Bills were introduced into {{both houses of}} the state legislature that December to accomplish this, and passed the House of Representatives. Before <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>bill</b> could be passed by the Senate, Tillman sent a proposal {{in the form of}} an amendment, with instructions to pass the amended bill, and enact nothing else on the subject. Based on a system that had been successful in Athens, Georgia, the bill banned the private sale of alcohol, setting up a system of dispensaries that would sell alcohol in sealed containers—sale by the drink, and consumption on the premises, would not be permitted. Both houses passed Tillman's amendment, though there was opposition both within and outside the legislature. The dispensary system went into effect on July 1, 1893.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1876, several {{bills were}} {{introduced}} in the House of Representatives {{in an effort to}} resume the free coinage of silver. One such bill introduced into the House by Democratic Representative Richard P. Bland of Missouri was passed in the fall of 1876. Republican senator William B. Allison of Iowa added important amendments to the bill in the Senate. <b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>bill</b> allowed Free Silver; one of Allison's amendments struck that provision. This same amendment allowed for the issuance of silver certificates {{for the first time in}} United States history. The bill was vetoed by President Rutherford B. Hayes. The president's veto was overridden on February 28, 1878. What came to be known as the Bland–Allison Act required that the Treasury purchase between two and four million dollars' worth of silver per month, to be coined into silver dollars at the former gold/silver value ratio of 16:1, meaning that one ounce of gold would be valued the same as sixteen ounces of silver.|$|E
25|$|In March 2012, Sires also {{pushed for}} a two-year bill that would help by funding {{highways}} and mass transit. He also pushed to extend the current surface transportation bill so the House and Senate can reconcile the differences between <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>bill</b> and the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21).|$|E
25|$|In February 2017 a {{bill was}} passed in the US state of Virginia (<b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>bill,</b> HB2016, and the Senate bill, SB1207) that will allow {{autonomous}} delivery robots to travel on sidewalks and use crosswalks statewide beginning on July 1, 2017.

25|$|In November 2009, Ellsworth {{wrote an}} {{amendment}} restricting {{federal funding for}} elective abortions. Americans United for Life asserted that this language does not eliminate the public funding of abortion in <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>bill,</b> but instead only requires said federal subsidies to be separately disbursed by an independent contractor. Ellsworth later voted for the Stupak Amendment. He eventually voted for the Senate language of the healthcare bill lacking the Stupak Amendment's anti-abortion language.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>bill</b> was {{sponsored}} by Representatives Fred Upton (R–6th MI) and Ed Whitfield (R–1st KY).

An identically worded bill was authored and introduced into the United States Senate by Senator Jim Inhofe (R–OK) and cosponsored by Senators Thad Cochran and Roger Wicker (R–MS) and Marco Rubio (R–FL).|$|E
25|$|Senate Republicans {{forced a}} near {{unprecedented}} level of changes (near $150 billion) in <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>bill,</b> which had more closely followed the Obama plan. A {{comparison of the}} $827 billion economic recovery plan drafted by Senate Democrats with an $820 billion version passed by the House and the final $787 billion conference version shows huge shifts within these similar totals. Additional debt costs would add about $350 billion or more over 10 years. Many provisions were set to expire in two years.|$|E

25|$|The main funding {{differences}} between the Senate bill and <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>bill</b> were: More funds for {{health care in the}} Senate ($153.3 vs $140 billion), renewable energy programs ($74 vs. $39.4 billion), for home buyers tax credit ($35.5 vs. $2.6 billion), new payments to the elderly and a one-year increase in AMT limits. The House had more funds appropriated for education ($143 vs. $119.1 billion), infrastructure ($90.4 vs. $62 billion) and for aid to low income workers and the unemployed ($71.5 vs. $66.5 billion).|$|E
25|$|The House and Senate {{bill would}} differ, somewhat, in their overall impact. The Senate bill would cover an {{additional}} 31 million people, at a federal budget cost of nearly $850 billion (not counting unfunded mandates) over ten years, reduce the ten-year deficit by $130 billion, {{and reduce the}} deficit in the second decade by around 0.25% of GDP. <b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>bill,</b> meanwhile, would cover an additional 36 million people, cost roughly $1050 billion in coverage provisions, reduce the ten-year deficit by $138 billion, and slightly reduce the deficit in the second decade.|$|E
25|$|Under 2017 American Health Care Act (AHCA) {{legislation}} {{under the}} House and Senate, both versions of proposed Republican bills have proposed cuts to Medicaid funding on differing timelines. Under both bills, the Congressional Budget Office has rated these as reducing coverage of Americans by Medicaid, with the Senate bill reducing costs of Medicaid {{by the year}} 2026 with by a reduction of cost by 26 percent in comparison to projections of ACA subsidies. Additionally, CBO estimated have predicted number of uninsured rising under AHCA from 28 million persons to 49 million (under the Senate bill) or to 51 (under <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Bill).</b>|$|E

25|$|The Volcker Rule was not {{included}} in Obama's initial June 2009 proposal, but Obama proposed the rule later in January 2010, after <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>bill</b> had passed. The rule, which prohibits depository banks from proprietary trading (similar to the prohibition of combined investment and commercial banking in the Glass–Steagall Act), was passed only in the Senate bill, and the conference committee enacted the rule in a weakened form, Section 619 of the bill, that allowed banks to invest up to 3% of their Tier 1 capital in private equity and hedge funds as well as trade for hedging purposes.|$|E
25|$|On May 25, 1972, {{as part of}} the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Bicentennial Civic Center Act, the Senate passed {{legislation}} (S. 3943) legally designating the FBI building as the J. Edgar Hoover Building. A similar bill in the United States House of Representatives (H.R. 16645) was also moving forward. <b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>bill</b> was amended several times. The House subsequently passed S. 3943 on October 3, after amending it to include the amended language of H.R. 16645. The Senate agreed to the House amendments on October 14. Nixon signed the legislation into law as Public Law 92-520 on October 21, 1972.|$|E
25|$|The House of Representatives, {{which was}} the first chamber to {{consider}} amendments, conducted seven weeks of hearings on amendatory legislation at which over 100 witnesses testified, most of whom supported extending the Act's special provisions by at least 10 years. President Ronald Reagan's administration largely stayed out of the debate as the legislation worked its way through the House. However, President Reagan did indicate he supported replacing the coverage formula with a nationwide preclearance requirement. The House ultimately passed legislation maintaining the coverage formula and permanently extending the special provisions. Supporters of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>bill</b> hoped to sustain the momentum from the House and expedite approval of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>bill</b> in the Senate, but Senators opposing the legislation slowed its passage through extensive committee hearings. Furthermore, the Reagan Administration announced its support for only a 10-year extension of the special provisions. The Senate eventually compromised on maintaining the coverage formula unchanged and extending the special provisions by 25 years, except for the Section 203(c) bilingual election requirement, which was extended for seven years. The Senate also agreed to liberalize the bailout procedure to allow a covered state or local government to escape coverage by proving to the U.S. District Court for D.C. that it had complied with the Voting Rights Act and undertook constructive efforts to expand opportunities for political participation in the 10 years preceding its bailout request. The bailout procedure was also amended to allow a local government to bail out of coverage even if its parent state was covered.|$|E

25|$|The {{bill was}} sponsored, {{in both houses}} of the U.S. Congress, by a {{bipartisan}} group of legislators. The initial sponsors of the bill in the Senate were Edward Kennedy (D-MA) and Jeff Sessions (R-AL) and, in the House of Representatives the legislation was sponsored by Representative Frank Wolf (R-VA) and Rep. Bobby Scott (D-VA), who was the initial co-sponsor. The Senate bill picked up four co-sponsors on the day it was passed, they were: Senators Mike Dewine (R-OH), Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA). <b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>bill</b> had a total of 32 co-sponsors, including Scott.

25|$|While the Government {{wanted to}} pass C-38, its main {{priority}} was to first pass C-48 (the NDP {{additions to the}} budget), which the Bloc and the Conservatives opposed. The third reading vote on that bill in the House was expected the final week of June, after the House adopted a motion (supported by the Liberals, Bloc Québécois, and NDP) to extend the sitting of <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> <b>Bill</b> C-48 passed just before midnight on June 23, 2005 when the Liberals agreed with the Bloc and NDP to force a snap vote on the bill. The snap vote on C-48 was significant because if all Conservative MPs were present for the vote, and if all Bloc opposed, and the Independents voted as they usually did, the Government would have been defeated.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} the subsidy given to a family {{to cover the cost}} of a premium is {{calculated}} using a formula that includes the family's income relative to the federal poverty level. The federal poverty level is related to a determined percentage that defines how much of that family's income can be put towards a health insurance premium. For instance, under <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Bill,</b> a family at 200% of the federal poverty level will spend no more than 5.5% of its annual income on health insurance premiums. Under the Senate Bill, the same family would spend no more than 6.3% of its annual income on health insurance premiums. The difference between the family's maximum contribution to health insurance premiums and the cost of the health insurance premium is paid for by the federal government.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{its passage}} in <b>the</b> <b>House,</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> was not {{expected}} to pass in the Senate. On March 12, 2014, President Barack Obama {{announced that he would}} veto H.R. 4138 if it was sent to him.|$|R
