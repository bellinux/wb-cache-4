40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>tightening</b> <b>torques</b> {{on the life}} of plates bolted using single and double lap joints was investigated. The effect of plate {{thickness}} using an aircraft grade aluminium alloy with double lap joints was also studied. Constant amplitude fatigue tests, under load control, were carried out, with a near zero stress ratio, on plain specimens (for bench mark purposes) and on both single and double lap joint specimens, for which several torque levels were applied on the bolted joints. The objective of the fatigue tests was to demonstrate failure trends for each joint type, material thickness and torque loading, rather than the generation of comprehensive S-N curves.

30|$|Figure  3 {{shows the}} typical {{relationships}} obtained for tightening angle versus clamp force, <b>tightening</b> <b>torque,</b> and thread torque. In C. japonica, <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> and thread torque follow {{the profile of}} clamp force: first rising, then falling after reaching a peak value. The initial, sharp rise in <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> and thread torque is likely the initial driving torque when the lag screw head pressed against the bearing surface. Similar behavior was observed in P. menziesii at all tightening speeds and in C. obtusa at tightening speeds of 10 and 20  rpm. In all test specimens of C. obtusa at tightening speeds of 1 and 4  rpm, however, jagged, ‘sawtooth’ patterns are apparent in the relationships between tightening angle and clamp force, <b>tightening</b> <b>torque,</b> and thread torque. During the experiments, the wooden members were heard to creak, suggesting these fluctuations were due to stick-slip behavior between the lag screw thread and the main member. When major stick-slip occurs, the resultant clamp force is predicted to be highly variable, even if a torque control method were applied.|$|R

The first phase of this study used nine EH implants and abutments that were divided into three groups with different amounts of bacterial suspension (n= 3) : V 0. 5 : 0. 5 µL; V 1. 0 : 1. 0 µL e V 1. 5 : 1. 5 µL, and tightened to the manufacturer's recommended torque. The second phase of this experiment used 27 assemblies that {{were similar to those}} used in the first phase. These samples were inoculated with 0. 5 µL of bacterial suspension and divided into three groups (n= 9). T 10 : 10 Ncm; T 20 : 20 Ncm and T 32 : 32 Ncm. The samples were evaluated according to the turbidity of the broth every 24 hours for 14 days, and the bacteria viability was tested after that period. The statistical evaluation was conducted by Kruskal-Wallis testing (p<. 05). RESULTS: During the first phase, groups V 1. 0 and V 1. 5 was presented with bacterial contamination in all samples after 24 h.

40|$|Background: The final {{position}} of the abutment changes {{with the amount of}} tightening torque. This could eventually lead to loss of passivity and marginal misfit of prostheses. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of three different <b>tightening</b> <b>torques</b> on the marginal adaptation of 3 -unit cement-retained implant-supported fixed dental prostheses (FDPs). Materials and Methods: Two implants (Straumann) were inserted in an acrylic block so that one of the implants was placed vertically and the other at a 15 ° vertical angle. A straight abutment and a 15 ° angulated abutment were connected to the vertically and obliquely installed implants, respectively, so that the two abutments were parallel. Then, 10 cement-retained FDPs were waxed and cast. Abutments were tightened with 10, 20, and 35 Ncm torques, respectively. Following each tightening torque, FDPs were luted on respective abutments with temporary cement. The marginal adaptation of the retainers was evaluated using stereomicroscope. FDPs were then removed from the abutments and were sectioned at the connector sites. The retainers were luted again on their respective abutments. Luting procedures and marginal adaptation measurement were repeated. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and least significant difference tests (α = 0. 05). After cutting the FDP connectors, the independent samples t-test was used to compare misfit values (α = 0. 05). Results: Following 10, 20, and 35 Ncm <b>tightening</b> <b>torques,</b> the marginal discrepancy of the retainers of FDPs significantly increased (P 0. 05). The marginal gap values of angulated abutment retainers (ANRs) were significantly higher than those of the straight abutment after cutting the connectors (P = 0. 026). Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, the marginal misfit of cement-retained FDPs increased continuously when the tightening torque increased.

30|$|In {{terms of}} the {{equipment}} for bolting, {{there are two main}} methods for increasing bolt’s prestress (Kang and Wang 2007): one is to increase the bolt-nut tightening torque; the second is to use a bolt tensioning device, which is similar to imposing large prestresses on anchor bolts. The methods for improving bolt-nut <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> include: (1) high torque jumbolter. With a high torque jumbolter, it can not only increase the bolt <b>tightening</b> <b>torque,</b> but also achieve an integration of bolt installation to improve installation speed. For instance, the torque of the jumbolter used with continuous miner can reach more than 300  N m. The rated torque of a single jumbolter in China is not greater than 150  N m, and unable to meet the requirement of high <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> of the bolt. (2) Torque multiplier. In order to improve the installation torque of the jumbolter, a torque multiplier can be used on the jumbolter to multiply the nut <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> when installing bolt. (3) Torque wrench. Using a large torque preload wrench to tighten the bolts and nuts is an effective way to improve the prestress of anchor bolts.|$|R

40|$|In this research, an {{experimental}} method {{for measuring the}} clamping force {{as a result of}} tightening torque in double lap simple bolted and hybrid (bolted-bonded) joints is proposed. Two types of joints, i. e. double lap simple and hybrid (bolted-bonded) joints were prepared for testing. In order to measure the clamping force or pretension resulting from the tightening torque at different applied torques, for both types of joints, a special experimental method was designed using a steel bush that was placed between the nut and the plate. Two strain gauges were stuck to the outer surface of the bush to measure the compressive axial strain and also the stress in the bush using Hooke’s law. Finally, the axial force in the bush and subsequently the clamping force were determined. The test was repeated three times for each case to obtain the mean value of compressive strains and to determine the corresponding clamping forces.

40|$|In this thesis, {{the fatigue}} {{behaviour}} of aluminium alloy 7075 -T 6 in bolted joints {{has been studied}} where the joint plates may suffer from fretting fatigue phenomenon under applied clamping forces and oscillatory displacements. The main aim was to improve the fretting fatigue resistance of the aluminium joint by means of surface coatings method. First, the isolated effect of the bolt clamping force on the fatigue strength of a bolt-filled hole was studied {{in the absence of}} fretting. The results showed beneficial compressive stresses around the aluminium bolted holes with localised maximum magnitudes at the critical edge of the hole where there is a high tensile stress concentration {{as a result of the}} applied tensile load. The presence of the clamping compressive stresses was confirmed at different environmental temperatures of - 50, 25 and 60 °C as typical flight temperatures. The compressive stress clearly reduced the net effect of the damaging cyclic longitudinal tensile stress which causes fatigue crack initiations and propagation due to the applied loads. Therefore, the fatigue strength of the bolted plates was substantially improved using higher <b>tightening</b> <b>torques</b> at the three tested environmental temperatures. In the second part of this study, the fatigue behaviour of Al 7075 -T 6 plates coated with two different coating materials was investigated. Titanium nitride (TiN) and nickel-phosphorous (Ni-P) coatings were deposited onto the aluminium substrate using physical vapour deposition (PVD) and electroless nickel (EN) plating processes, respectively. These coating materials were selected because of their favourable characteristics mainly for fretting fatigue considerations such as high hardness, low friction and good wear resistance. However, high operating temperature of the PVD process reduced the mechanical properties as well as fatigue strength of the aluminium substrate coated with TiN. Therefore, a post heat treatment was developed to restore the lost properties. Although the applied heat treatment substantially improved the tensile and fatigue strengths of the coated material, the lost properties were not fully recovered to achieve the original properties of Al 7075 -T 6. A double-lap bolted joint specimen was then designed and manufactured from the aluminium plates and subsequently coated with Ni-P coatings with a high phosphorous content of 10 - 13 wt%. Different <b>tightening</b> <b>torques</b> were applied to clamp the plates together with the aim of studying the effect of clamping force on the fretting fatigue life of the coated joints. Ni-P coatings were successfully found to protect Al 7075 -T 6 clamped plates against fretting fatigue damages even at low fatigue loads where the uncoated joints showed a large reduction in their fatigue life due to the fretting effects. Fretting fatigue life of moderately and firmly clamped plates was improved by 35 % and 59 % respectively after the application of Ni-P coatings...|$|E

40|$|Surgeons {{generally}} use subjective feel {{to tighten}} bone screws {{as much as}} possible without stripping the threads; however, subsequent fixation failures are common, particularly in osteoporotic bone. We hypothesise that if the preload generated in reduced bone quality and it’s dissipation over time was better understood, then some of these failures could be avoided through the use of more appropriate fastening torques or a different number of screws. This ongoing study aims to develop a validated finite element model capable of predicting the preload generated for different bone densities and cortical thicknesses. To date, experimental tests (n= 10) were conducted using bovine tibiae (4 - 5 months) to evaluate the bone-implant pressure (LLW Prescale Fuji Film) and surface strains (Ncorr v 1. 2, G. I. T.) for a range of <b>tightening</b> <b>torques.</b> The bone density (assessed using CT-images) and cortical thickness of each specimen were recorded.

The predicted bone-implant pressure also compared favorably with a pressure varying between 2. 5 and 0 MPa. Using an experimentally derived relationship between fastening torque and bone-implant pressure, the model has the potential to predict preload for any bone quality.

40|$|This {{research}} work {{is concerned with}} the determination of elastic-plastic deformation behaviour of structural members to combined tension-torsion loadings. Three aspects of the work were examined. In the first, an adaptive control system is developed for performing combined tension and torsion tests on solid and thin-walled tubular specimens by using systems supplied by National Instruments to control the axial and torsion loads on the specimen through data acquisition boards. The LabView software in conjunction with data acquisition board, servo-controllers and servomotors form the adaptive control system for the torque-tension machine. The second aspect was to carry out experimental investigations, where solid steel rods (structural steel) were subjected to non-proportional combined tension-torsion loading paths. In these loading paths, initial elastic tension followed by torsion, holding corresponding axial displacement constant and initial elastic torsion followed by tension, keeping the corresponding angle of twist constant, were examined The experimental programme also considered the non-proportional combined tension-torsion loading of thin walled steel tubes. It has been observed experimentally that, when the rod is initially subjected to an axial load keeping the corresponding axial displacement constant and then followed by subsequently application of the torque the rod behaves as if its axial load carrying capacity decreases without affecting its torque carrying ability. Similarly when the rod is initially subjected to a torque, keeping its corresponding angle of twist constant, and then followed by subsequently application of the axial load the rod behaves as if its torque carrying capacity is reduced without affecting its axial load carrying ability. The third aspect was devoted to the finite element analysis. The finite element analysis package ANSYS (version 5. 7) was used for the analysis of the combined tension-torsion loadings of the steel rods. The geometry of the steel rod was supplied to the Ansys package and meshed. The preconditioning conjugate gradient (PCG) and the spare direct solver were used to solve all the combination of loads. Experimental results obtained were compared with computed values from the finite element analysis and are presented. Reasonably good agreement is obtained between the experimental and computed stresses and displacements.

40|$|In {{the design}} of {{rotating}} machinery it is often necessary to bolt components together with a known preload since the same controls the system dynamics considerably. Since a major percentage bolt <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> is resisted by frictional forces especially {{towards the end of}} tightening, and since the coefficient of friction in threads and under the bolt head to a large degree is indeterminate, the best method of ensuring desired clamping load is by measurement of bolt elongation, or by a load cell. However in large number of cases the incorporation of load cell is not practical and bolt elongation is insufficient to allow accurate measurement. ln such cases it becomes necessary to produce the desired end load by applying a specified torque to the bolt leading to the determination of nut factor. for each of the cases Here an attempt has been made to obtain the quantitative values of nut factors for bolted joints as a function of bolt diameter and <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> applied on bolted joints.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the elasto-plastic behaviour of circular rods under combined torsion-tension loading Three aspects of the work were examined. In the first, an instrumented mechanical torque-tension machine was designed, built and commissioned to enable the application of biaxial loading under controlled conditions. The main features of the machine are (1) it can apply either simultaneous or individual loadings subject to a specific deformation history and (11) it provides the time variations of the controlling and the controlled deformation parameters using the appropriate load cells and tranducing elements. Whilst the machine was controlled by analogue signals, it was designed such that it could allow digital control of the different command signals. An analytical model to calculate the stiffness of the machine has been developed. The second was wholly devoted to the experimental investigations where solid, copper and steel, circular rods were subjected to complex non-proportional biaxial loading paths. In these paths, elasto-plastic torsion followed by tension, keeping the angle of twist constant, and elasto-plastic tension followed by torsion, holding the corresponding axial displacement constant, were examined. Other loading paths, where the initial axial loads and the torques were maintained constant, and where the torque and the axial load were applied successively, were also studied. The expenmental programme also considered the biaxial loading of thinwalled steel tubes. In the third, the experimental results were compared with two different analytical models from the literature Numerical solutions were also obtained along the lines descnbed in an available literature. Expenmentally, it has been observed that when the rod is initially subjected to a torque and then, keeping the angle of twist constant, to a gradually increasing axial load, the rod behaves as if its torque carrying ability becomes drastically reduced without in any way affecting its load carrying ability. Similarly, when the rod is initially subjected to an axial load and then, keeping the axial displacement constant, to a gradually increasing torque, the rod behaves as if its load carrying ability becomes drastically reduced without in any way affecting its torque carrying ability Such reductions in the load or torque capacity appear to be governed by the material plastic yield criterion. During the successively applied loading, it has been observed that when the rod is initially subjected to an initial torque and then to a successively applied axial load and torque, keeping the axial displacement or the angle of twist constant in an alternate manner, the rod soon regains its axial load carrying capability irrespective of the initially applied torque. Similarly, during the multiple alterations of successively applied torque or axial load, it has been observed that at any stage for the axial load or torque, whichever was applied subsequently, the rod regains its carrying capability of the parameter involved. Experimental test results with fitted strain gauges show that, even when the angle of twist or axial displacement was held constant, the strain readings increase rapidly with the decrease of the initially applied torque or axial load at the confined zone where the plastic deformation begins. Elsewhere of the specimen the strain readings decrease. The findings of this work have direct bearing on the relaxation of <b>tightening</b> <b>torques</b> or axial loads as experienced by critical engineering components, such as couplings, bolted joints and rotating shafts, which are subjected to similar type of biaxial loadings...|$|E

In order to apply appropriate torque, the relationship between <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> and initial load should be determined. In this study, a detailed three-dimensional finite element model of bolted joints was established with consideration of helix angle, pitch, thread type, tooth-type angle, and other details. The process of pre-tightening of bolted joints was simulated to validate the finite element model. The curves for the relationship between the torque and initial load obtained from finite element analysis agree well with those calculated from theoretical equations. Then, the influence of the friction coefficient, pitch, elastic modulus, assembly clearance, and strain-hardening exponent on the relationship was studied. The results show that the friction coefficient between nut and joint has great influence on the relationship between torque and initial load, that is, the larger the friction coefficient, the smaller the initial load of bolt at the same <b>tightening</b> <b>torque.</b> In contrast, the pitch, assembly clearance, Young’s modulus, and strain-hardening exponent have little influence on torque–initial load relation.

The objective of the paper is to better understand how shocks are transmitted to electronic boards and to investigate ways to mitigate these shocks. A projectile model is created to mimic an actual projectile. As projectiles are usually composed of threaded components, the effect of the <b>tightening</b> preload <b>torque</b> on accelerations and frequencies of components on boards is discussed. Experimental results show that increasing the <b>tightening</b> preload <b>torque</b> above a specific level can ensure that projectile behaves as a single body, which makes acceleration of a component on the board independent of <b>tightening</b> <b>torque.</b> Effect of mounting the board on polyurethane rubber is also considered. The paper also presents suggestions to simulate experimental test using finite element methods...|$|R

Twenty grub screws and twenty bolts were used to secure half pins on Rancho cubes using a calibrated torque wrench to determine the point at which breakage at the driver–head interface occurs (Fig.  1 e).|$|R

Two types of geometric characteristics, i. e. the width {{and the distance}} between the hole center and the free edge of the substrate, are used in order to verify the effect of {{the distance between the}} bolted joint and the edge effects. Mechanical testing in tensile shearing are carried out to verify the influence of: <b>tightening</b> <b>torque,</b> number and disposition of bolted joint (1 bolted joint, 2 bolted joints (vertical and horizontal row), 3 bolted joints and 4 bolted joints). The <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> value isn't significant for the failure mode and has little influence on the global behavior of the bolted joint. The failure modes depend on the edge effects, on the number and disposition of bolts...|$|R

For most reversed shoulder prostheses, the baseplate of the glenoid component is uncemented and its primary stability {{is provided by}} a central peg and peripheral screws. Because {{of the importance of}} the primary stability for a good osteo-integration of the baseplate, the optimal fixation of the screws is crucial. In particular, the amplitude of the tightening force of the nonlocking screws is clearly associated to this stability. Since this force is unknown, it is currently not accounted for in experimental or numerical analyses. Thus, the primary goal of this work is to measure this tightening force experimentally. In addition, the <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> was also measured, to estimate an optimal surgical value. METHODS: An experimental setup with an instrumented baseplate was developed to measure simultaneously the <b>tightening</b> force, <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> and screwing angle, of the nonlocking screws of the Aquealis reversed prosthesis. In addition, the amount of bone volume around each screw was measured with a micro-CT. Measurements were performed on 6 human cadaveric scapulae. FINDINGS: A statistically correlated relationship (p< 0. 05, R= 0. 83) was obtained between the maximal tightening force and the bone volume. The relationship between the <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> and the bone volume was not statistically significant. INTERPRETATION: The experimental relationship presented in this paper can be used in numerical analyses to improve the baseplate fixation in the glenoid bone...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{self-loosening}} of threaded fasteners subjected to dynamic shear load. Three kinds of typical coatings, PTFE, MoS 2, and TiN applied to bolts and nuts, are tested in this investigation. The study experimentally examines the loosening mechanisms of fasteners and assesses the anti-loosening {{performance of the}} three tested coatings based on their tightening characteristics, loosening curves, and the damage of thread surface. Additionally, the anti-loosening performance of the three coatings is compared under different load forms. The {{results indicate that the}} PTFE and MoS 2 coatings have significant anti-loosening effect, whereas the anti-loosening performance of TiN coating is not satisfactory. It is also found that an appropriate increase of the initial <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> can significantly improve the anti-loosening effect. In addition, the microscopic analyses of PTFE and MoS 2 coating reveal that a reduced initial <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> leads to fretting wear on the thread contact surfaces of fasteners, thereby aggravating the damage.|$|R
