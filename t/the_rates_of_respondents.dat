40|$|Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> breast self examination (BSE) among the female staff of University of Malaya {{and to determine}} the role of BSE in detecting breast abnormalities. Methods: A total of 1598 questionnaires were posted to all female staff, aged 35 years and above. Their knowledge on breast cancer, practice of BSE and detection <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> breast abnormality as confirmed by CBE was determined. Results: <b>The</b> response <b>rate</b> {{for this study was}} 45 percent (714 <b>respondents).</b> <b>The</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondents</b> having awareness on breast cancer was 98. 7 percent. Eighty four percent (598) <b>of</b> the <b>respondents</b> had performed BSE in their lifetime. However, in only 41 was it regular at the recommended time. Forty seven percent (334) had undergone CBE at least once in a lifetime but only 26 (185) had CBE at least once in the past 3 years, while 23 (165) had had a mammogram. There was a significant relationship between CBE and BSE whereby those who had CBE were twice more likely to do BSE. Nineteen percent (84 <b>respondents)</b> <b>of</b> those who did BSE claimed they had detected a breast lump. Of these, 87 (73) had gone for CBE and all were confirmed as such. Conclusion: BSE is still relevant as a screening tool of breast cancer since those who detect breast lump by BSE will most probably go for further check up. CBE should be done to all women, especially those at highest risk of breast cancer, to encourage and train for BSE...|$|R

40|$|Background Respondent fatigue, {{also known}} as survey fatigue, is a common problem in the {{collection}} of survey data. Factors that are known to influence respondent fatigue include survey length, survey topic, question complexity, and open-ended question type. There {{is a great deal of}} interest in understanding the drivers of physician survey responsiveness due to the value of information received from these practitioners. With the recent explosion of mobile smartphone technology, it has been possible to obtain survey data from users of mobile applications (apps) on a question-by-question basis. The author obtained basic demographic survey data as well as survey data related to an anesthesiology-specific drug called sugammadex and leveraged nonresponse rates to examine factors that influenced respondent fatigue. Methods Primary data were collected between December 2015 and February 2017. Surveys and in-app analytics were collected from global users of a mobile anesthesia calculator app. Key independent variables were user country, healthcare provider role, <b>rating</b> <b>of</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> app to personal practice, length of time in practice, and frequency of app use. Key dependent variable was the metric <b>of</b> <b>respondent</b> fatigue. Results Provider role and World Bank country income level were predictive <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondent</b> fatigue for this in-app survey. Importance of the app to the provider and length of time in practice were moderately associated with fatigue. Frequency of app use was not associated. This study focused on a survey with a topic closely related to the subject area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> app. <b>Respondent</b> fatigue <b>rates</b> will likely change dramatically if the topic does not align closely. Discussion Although apps may serve as powerful platforms for data collection, responses rates to in-app surveys may differ on the basis <b>of</b> important <b>respondent</b> characteristics. Studies should be carefully designed to mitigate fatigue as well as powered with the understanding <b>of</b> the <b>respondent</b> characteristics that may have higher <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondent</b> fatigue...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to obtain {{information}} about healthcare utilization, perceived barriers to care, and recognition of local health providers among Tyler, Texas residents living at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty line (FPL). ^ Methods: This study used data previously collected by Episcopal Health Foundation between November and December 2016. Demographic variables, including age, gender, race, zip code of residence (recoded as region number), self-identified health rating, and survey language were tabulated. Healthcare utilization variables including <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondents</b> with a primary medical doctor and median number of PCP and general medical visits in the last twelve months were calculated. Among respondents lacking a personal doctor, the reasons for not having a personal doctor were tabulated. Chi Square tests of association were employed to assess for relationships between location of residence and having a PCP, recognition of the local federally qualified health center, and access issues in the last twelve months. Univar ate logistic regression was performed to compute odds ratios, 95 % confidence intervals and p values with access issues in the last twelve months and recognition of the local Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) as dependent variables. Variables with a p value of less than 0. 20 were incorporated into multivariate analysis. ^ Results: Respondents were racially and ethnically diverse. Two thirds <b>of</b> <b>respondents</b> had a personal doctor, and not having a personal doctor was associated with having access issues in the last year. Slightly more than 10 percent identify the emergency room as their usual source of care. When asked about reasons for not having a personal doctor and going to the ER for care, respondents were more concerned with insurance coverage, cost, and accessibility rather than provider-related factors. In addition, those without a personal doctor were less likely to recognize the local FQHC. ^ Conclusions: The data suggest that there are significant gaps in healthcare utilization, identifiable barriers to care, and inadequate recognition of local providers among Tyler residents living at or below 200 percent of the FPL. There is a significant opportunity for targeted interventions to link resource-poor individuals to appropriate care sources, including but not limited to the local FQHC. ...|$|R

40|$|The saying, {{beauty is}} in the eye of the beholder, is {{relevant}} in the use of attractive and credible celebrities in advertisements. A celebrity endorser is seen as a model who enjoys recognition from the public and who can be seen as an ubiquitous feature of marketing today. The use of celebrity endorsers is a fairly common practice in many organisations in supporting their corporate or brand image. This article focuses on both the attractiveness and also the credibility of celebrities in advertisements. It is anticipated that attractive celebrities and credible celebrities could influence attitudes positively, and that this will eventually lead to the purchasing of the advertised products and services. O’Mahony and Meenaghan’s (1997 / 1998) Perceptions of Celebrity Endorsements Scale was used to measure the overall attitudes of students on celebrity endorsements. Separate sets of items were developed to measure attractive and credible celebrities separately. The internal consistency reliability of these measurement scales reflected high scores on all items. In general, the respondents positively perceived celebrity endorsements.

40|$|One of {{the main}} problems, faced by the {{construction}} industry is cost overrun. The final cost {{at the completion of}} the project exceeds over the initial cost, during the time of inception of the project. As a result of this, the projects have to be stopped or reduced their scopes, without fulfilling the total requirements of the end users. So, it is necessary to analyze the main causes for the cost overrun in construction projects. After the end of thirty years of war and recent Tsunami, there are many reconstruction projects, especially in building sector undergoing in Sri Lanka. It is observed that the cost overrun {{at the end of the}} project, created unpleasant situations among the clients, consultants and contractors. The contractors are the most affected by the issue of cost overrun, because they have to wait for their payments for a certain period due to the unavailability of excess fund. The aim of the research project is to identify the main factors contributing the cost overrun in the view of contractors and how they are distributed. The other focusing area of this study is to find out the steps to mitigate the cost overrun in future. The preliminary data for this research have been collected through a literature review from Sri Lanka and worldwide. The main factors causing cost overrun listed from the literature review, were modified using the facts obtained from the case studies and the opinions of some experts in the field. A detailed questionnaire form has been prepared using the modified factors and circulated island wide. 77 questionnaires were received, out of 180 issued questionnaires and <b>the</b> response <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> 43 %. <b>The</b> data analysis was carried out using the relative importance index method. The Five point priority scale was used to rank the significant factors according to <b>the</b> <b>rating</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondents.</b> In addition to that, an open ended question was added in the last part of the questionnaire form to get the views of the mitigation of cost overrun in future. From the results, "Cost due to extra work" is identified as the top most influencing factor of cost overrun in overall basis. "Cost due to extra quantity", "Changes in design", "Changes in scope", "Cost due to adverse weather" and "Price fluctuation of materials" are identified as the next five significant factors. The analysis was further carried out in relation with the project size and the type of the fund and almost similar results were obtained. In the case of remedial measures of cost overrun, the respondents suggests that the adoption of proper planning and using efficient methods in estimate preparation are the best solution for avoiding the cost overrun in future. They further stress that the frequent changes in scope are to be avoided, in order to keep the contract value in control...|$|R

Methods Members of the Australia and New Zealand Society of Palliative Medicine were sent an online ketamine utilisation survey. Results A total of 123 / 392 clinicians responded (31 % response <b>rate).</b> <b>The</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>respondents</b> had practised for more than 10 years in a metropolitan hospital setting.

This research paper investigates <b>the</b> <b>rates</b> and predictors <b>of</b> urban community disaster risk perception, awareness and preparedness, at individual and household levels. Methods A randomized cross-sectional, population-based telephone survey study was conducted among the Cantonese-speaking population aged over 15 years in Hong Kong. Descriptive statistics were reported. A stepwise {{multivariate logistic regression analysis}} was conducted to determine the independent associations between risk perceptions, socioeconomic factors, household characteristics, and personal background. Findings Final study sample comprised <b>of</b> 1002 <b>respondents</b> with a 63 % response <b>rate.</b> <b>The</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>respondents</b> (82. 3 %) did not perceive Hong Kong as a disaster-susceptible city. Half (54. 6 %) reported beliefs that the local population had lower disaster awareness than other global cities. Infectious disease outbreak (72. 4 %), typhoon (12. 6 %), and fire (7. 1 %) were ranked as the most-likely-to-occur population-based disasters. Although over 77 % believed that basic first aid training was necessary for improving individual disaster preparedness, only a quarter (26. 1 %) <b>of</b> <b>respondents</b> reported participation in training.

40|$|Purpose:  The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the extent and pattern of use of grading scales for contact lens complications (‘grading scales’) in optometric practice. Methods:  An anonymous postal survey was sent to all 756 members of the Queensland Division of Optometrists Association Australia. Information was elicited relating to level of experience, practice type and location, and mode of usage of grading scales. Results:  Survey forms were returned by 237 optometrists, representing a 31 per cent response <b>rate.</b> <b>The</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>respondents</b> (61 per cent) reported using grading scales frequently in practice, while 65 per cent of these preferred to use the Efron Grading Scales for Contact Lens Complications. Seventy-six per cent of optometrists use a method of incremental grading rather than simply grading with whole numbers. Grading scales are more likely to be used by optometrists who have recently graduated (p < 0. 001), have a postgraduate certificate in ocular therapeutics (p = 0. 018), see more contact lens patients (p = 0. 027) and use other forms of grading scales (p < 0. 001). The most frequently graded ocular conditions were corneal staining, papillary conjunctivitis and conjunctival redness. The main reasons for not using grading scales included a preference for sketches, photographs or descriptions (87 per cent) and unavailability of scales (29 per cent). Conclusion:  Grading scales for contact lens complications are used extensively in optometric practice for a variety of purposes. This tool can now be considered as an expected norm in contact lens practice. We advocate the incorporation of such grading scales into professional guidelines and standards for good optometric clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Although web-based survey {{research}} {{of the general population}} has serious limitations (e. g., non-coverage, lack of a sampling plan), it has been embraced by many who do {{survey research}}. It {{has been shown to be}} particularly useful when the population surveyed is almost universally connected to the Internet, and is proficient with the medium and the tools to use the medium (computing devices: e. g., desktop computers, PDAs, etc.). In this experiment conducted on a panel of electronics engineers and engineering managers, we explore issues that may affect response rates, and response quality. Respondents are asked to report on the process of designing an integrated circuit. First, we examine the effect of a time-honored method on both unit response <b>rates</b> and speed <b>of</b> delivery: a random half of the panel received a notification in advance of the survey invitation, informing them that they would be asked to participate in a few days; the other half did not. Second, we analyze what effect two different formats of the same instrument have on response quality. One half of the panel was randomly assigned to a scroll-type web questionnaire, in which the instrument is loaded onto one web page and the respondent scrolls down from one question to the next; the other half of the panel received a multiple page-type questionnaire, in which the respondents click on a button to move from one question to the next.

40|$|Background: South Africa is on {{the brink}} of another wave of major health system reforms that {{underscore}} the centrality of primary health care (PHC). Nursing managers will {{play a critical role in}} these reforms. Objective: The aim of the study was to explore the work experiences of PHC clinic nursing managers through the use of reflective diaries, a method hitherto under-utilised in health systems research in low- and middle-income countries. Design: During 2012, a sub-set of 22 PHC nursing managers was selected randomly from a larger nurses’ survey in two South African provinces. After informed consent, participants were requested to keep individual diaries for a period of 6 weeks, using a clear set of diary entry guidelines. Reminders consisted of weekly short message service reminders and telephone calls. Diary entries were analysed using thematic content analysis. A diary feedback meeting was held with all the participants to validate the findings. Results: Fifteen diaries were received, representing a 68 % response <b>rate.</b> <b>The</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>respondents</b> (14 / 15) were female, each with between 5 and 15 years of nursing experience. Most participants made their diary entries at home. Diaries proved to be cathartic for individual nursing managers. Although inter-related and not mutually exclusive, the main themes that emerged from the diary analysis were health system deficiencies; human resource challenges; unsupportive management environment; leadership and governance; and the emotional impact of clinic management. Conclusions: Diaries are an innovative method of capturing the work experiences of managers at the PHC level, as they allow for confidentiality and anonymity, often not possible with other qualitative research methods. The expressed concerns of nursing managers must be addressed to ensure the success of South Africa's health sector reforms, particularly at the PHC level...|$|R
40|$|Selection and {{acquisition}} have mostly been considered in international literature as a collateral aspect of Collection Development and many surveys {{have been carried}} out to assess library acquisitions, such as the evaluation of collections through comparisons with well-known bibliographic lists, users data regarding loans, user requests, etc. Recently a considerable number of publications have dealt with the evaluation of bibliographic sources on the Internet and the integration and interoperability of library management systems with vendor systems for selection {{and acquisition}} purposes. 	Considering the scant information and data regarding Italian libraries, the aim of the research was to describe and explore the situation in Italian university and public research libraries regarding selection and acquisition procedures with the focus on books. Taking into account the increasing importance of journals, this choice was dictated by many factors, such as the increasing cuts in funds for books, the intention to understand their role in the scientific environment, also considering the evolution of the electronic publishing sector. Moreover, the objectives were also to explore vendors operating on the Italian market, their policies and attitudes toward libraries and how they are coping with the tremendous changes in the sector: the Internet, the aggressive policies of publishers and the shifting of publishing from printed to the electronic format. The research followed a qualitative approach with the purpose of describing and exploring libraries. Therefore a questionnaire was drawn up. After carrying out a pilot test, it was sent to university and public research libraries all around the country. Although, due to <b>the</b> low <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondents,</b> there were not sufficient quantitative data to develop a more complex analysis, some significant data could be analysed. At the same time, from 9 Vendors contacted 6 (Blackwell, Burioni, Casalini, Celdes, DEA and Esia) were interviewed using the technique of non-structured interviews. The conversations provided interesting information and suggestions on issues not previously considered, thanks also to the collaboration and the interest shown by vendors in the initiative. The interviews of two librarians, chosen in the scientific environment, provided more insight and additional information during the survey. After the analysis of data from the questionnaires and interviews and the following data processing, the findings were shown to the Key Informant, an expert in library management and electronic resources at the Faculty of Engineering and Architecture of the University of Parma. From a comparison of the questionnaire and interviews issues emerged that would need more in-depth analysis, such as: acquisitions procedure integration, purchasing power of the structure and competence of actors, terms of contract with vendors. A stimulating question was proposed, “Why don’t librarians and vendors develop a path of collaboration and partnership so that both can cope with the aggressive policies of publishers? Moreover, collaboration is needed to keep up with innovations and to cope with fund reductions and lack of recognition the profession of a librarian receives...|$|R

The definitive publisher-authenticated version Fam Pract. 2000 Aug; 17 (4) : 288 - 92 is available online at: [URL] The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the primary care experiences of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -positive individuals across Europe. METHODS: An anonymous self-administered questionnaire study was carried out between August 1996 and August 1997. A total of 15 HIV/AIDS treatment centres and 14 HIV support organizations in 11 European countries participated in the distribution of questionnaires. Overall, 1366 completed questionnaires were included in the analysis from a total of 2751 distributed (50 % response <b>rate).</b> <b>The</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>respondents</b> were homosexual men (53. 6 %), and 54. 2 % had AIDS or symptomatic HIV disease. The main outcome measures were use of GP services in the preceding 6 months, GP involvement in HIV care provision, satisfaction with current service provision and reasons for non-involvement of the primary care services. RESULTS: Most patients (64. 8 %) had visited their GP at least once in the preceding 6 months, but 53. 9 % <b>of</b> <b>respondents</b> reported that their GP was not involved in their HIV care. Of these patients, 53. 4 % would like their GP to be involved. Patients from central European countries were more likely to have seen their GP than their counterparts from northern and southern countries (P < 0. 005), and were less worried that the GP would not have enough knowledge about HIV (P = 0. 002) or would not be sympathetic (P = 0. 052). CONCLUSIONS: There are clear differences in GP utilization by HIV-positive individuals across Europe, reflecting in part local service provision but primarily patients' attitudes and beliefs. Strategies to promote the involvement of primary health care services need to address patients' core beliefs, if these are to be changed...|$|R
40|$|Background: The aging {{population}} is {{a rapidly growing}} demographic. Isolation and limited autonomy render many of the elderly vulnerable to abuse, neglect and exploitation. As the population grows, so does the need for Adult Protective Services (APS). This {{study was conducted to}} examine current knowledge of older adult protection laws in Georgia among APS staff and to identify training opportunities to better prepare the APS workforce in case detection and intervention. Methods: The Georgia State University Institute of Public Health faculty developed a primary survey in partnership with the Georgia Division of Aging Services’ leadership to identify key training priority issues for APS caseworkers and investigators. A 47 -item electronic questionnaire was delivered to all APS employees via work-issued email accounts. We conducted descriptive analyses, t-tests and chi-square analyses to determine APS employees’ baseline knowledge of Georgia’s elder abuse policies, laws and practices, as well as examine associations of age, ethnicity, and educational attainment with knowledge. We used a p-value of 0. 05 and 95 % confidence intervals to determine statistical significance of analyses performed. Result: Ninety-two out of 175 APS staff responded to the survey (53 % response <b>rate).</b> <b>The</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>respondents</b> were Caucasian (56 %) women (92 %). For over half the survey items, paired sample t-tests revealed significant differences between what APS staff reported as known and what APS staff members indicated they needed to know more about in terms of elder abuse and current policies. Chi-square tests revealed that non-Caucasians significantly preferred video conferencing as a training format (44 % compared to 18 %), [χ 2 (1) = 7. 102, p <. 008], whereas Caucasians preferred asynchronous online learning formats (55 % compared to 28 %) [χ 2 (1) = 5. 951, p <. 015]. Conclusion: Results from this study provide the Georgia Division of Aging with insight into specific policy areas that are not well understood by APS staff. Soliciting input from intended trainees allows public health educators to tailor and improve training sessions. Trainee input may result in optimization of policy implementation, which may result in greater injury prevention and protection of older adults vulnerable to abuse, neglect and exploitation.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Hospitality Management and DieteticsElizabeth B. BarrettAlong with {{increasing}} environmental challenges and {{large quantities of}} energy demand, many have become concerned about the environment and have implemented “Going Green” strategies. As a result, plans for sustainable development are being adopted by governments, institutions, operations, and individual households. Many National Association of College & University Food Service (NACUFS) members may have heard about sustainability, {{but they may not}} apply their knowledge to developing practical outcomes and solutions. Very little research has been published that measures how NACUFS members are responding to Sustainable Waste Management (SWM) and to the new Sustainability Guide published by the NACUFS organization in September 2009. The primary purposes of this study were to ascertain what SWM programs have been implemented in college and university foodservices operations and determine how NACUFS members’ attitudes, subjective norms, and barriers affect the implementation of additional SWM programs based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). A secondary purpose was to identify the differences in intention to implement sustainable waste management programs based on characteristics of the respondents’ age, size of facility, region of the country and if the facility had a sustainable waste management committee. In this study, 2, 184 NACUFS members whose e-mail addresses were listed in the NACUFS membership directory were selected as subjects. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 17. 0. Multiple linear regression analysis, T-tests, and ANOVA were used to test the hypotheses and research questions. Statistical significance was set at p≤ 0. 05. The total number of responses was 212 resulting in a 13. 5 % response <b>rate.</b> <b>The</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>respondents</b> had implemented SWM programs that don’t require major resources. NACUFS members had positive attitudes about implementing a SWM program and their superiors, university administrators, and students’ opinions were important others to consider when implementing a SWM program. Whether a college and university foodservice has a sustainability committee was the only demographic that significantly influenced NACUFS members’ intentions to implement a SWM program. 	Overall, attitude and subjective norms were the only significant predictors of intention to implement a SWM program (p≤. 05). Therefore, if NACFUS members have a positive attitude about sustainability, important others around them who agree and there is a sustainability committee within the operation, {{they are more likely to}} implement a SWM program.

40|$|Following the 2000 United States presidential {{election}} {{a team of}} faculty conducted a mail survey of donors who had contributed to any of eight presidential candidates. These included two Democrats (Bill Bradley and Al Gore), five Republicans (Gary Bauer, George Bush, Bob Dole, Steve Forbes, and John McCain), and Green candidate Ralph Nader. The sample was stratified by candidate; each candidate’s sample included approximately 300 donors sampled from public lists of donors maintained by the Federal Election Commission. Strata for Dole, Nader, and Bush were over-sampled for substantive reasons. No data was collected on modest (<$ 200) donors for the Forbes campaign as his campaign {{did not participate in}} public funding. Note that these samples were ALL drawn from individuals who gave before July 31, 2000. The ten-page survey instrument contained items designed to collect data on donor demographics, on political attributes, attitudes, and activities, on how the donors were solicited, and on how much, how often, and to whom they gave. It was sent directly to sampled donors via first class mail. Each envelope was addressed to a specific donor and included a personalized cover letter explaining the project. All letters were individually signed by hand. Business-reply return envelopes were provided with these materials. Approximately one month after the initial mailing, a follow-up request was sent to all sample members who had not returned a response. The text of the cover letter was changed to reflect a repeat request; otherwise, the contents were identical to the first mailing. One additional mailing was done for all remaining non-respondents, except those in Nader’s stratum. Participants were given the option of responding anonymously to the survey by erasing the unique identifying number written in pencil on their surveys. Eight percent of the total sample chose to respond anonymously, with <b>the</b> highest <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> anonymous <b>respondents</b> from <b>the</b> Bauer (11 %) and Forbes (10 %) strata, and <b>the</b> lowest <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> anonymous response from the Gore (5 %), McCain (6 %), and Bush (6 %) strata. The three waves were sent over the period from August to November of 2001. Following the 2004 United States {{presidential election}} the team sent slightly shorter surveys to every respondent to the 2000 survey who did not respond anonymously. 	 The six-page survey instrument contained items designed to collect data on donor demographics, on political attributes, attitudes, and activities, on how the donors were solicited, and on how much, how often, and to whom they gave. It was sent directly to sampled donors via first class mail. Each envelope was addressed to a specific donor and included a personalized cover letter explaining the project. All letters were individually signed by hand. Business-reply return envelopes were provided with these materials. Approximately {{two and a half months}} after the initial mailing, a follow-up request was sent to all sample members who had not returned a response. The text of the cover letter was changed to reflect a repeat request and to more firmly urge participation. Two additional mailing was done for all remaining non-respondents over the next four months. Participants were given the option of responding anonymously to the survey. However, color coded marks were added to envelopes so that we could identify the appropriate strata <b>of</b> each <b>respondent</b> even if their identity was not recorded. If individuals included identifying information on anonymous respondents (e. g. return addresses) we used this only to mark these respondents as having responded, but then deleted all identifying information. At any point in the process if mail was returned with a forwarding address a survey was immediately sent to the new address. However, a number of surveys were returned without forwarding addresses. In between the third and fourth waves we submitted these addresses to a commercial mailing firm that supplied new addresses using data collected by the United States Postal Service. Thereafter four “special waves” were sent (spaced approximately one month apart) to all addresses that had been located by this commercial firm. Because of anonymous responses, delays in the mail, and some human error some respondents received more than one survey even after having responded. In all cases the survey with the earliest post mark was included in the final dataset. On the cover letter respondents were encouraged to fill out the survey online.
