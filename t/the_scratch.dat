He also said {{he had failed to}} find in the photographs any chipped paint on the carpet below the mantelpiece, where it might have been expected to fall had the mantelpiece been scratched during a struggle. He was asked by the CCRC to examine a red spot on the carpet visible in photographs underneath the scratches on the mantelpiece. He said the red spot matched a piece of nail varnish missing from one of Sheila's toes. He concluded that <b>the</b> <b>scratch</b> marks on the mantel had been created after the day of the murders.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the theoretical modeling and numerical simulation of the probe tip based nanochannel <b>scratching.</b> According to <b>the</b> <b>scratching</b> depth, <b>the</b> probe tip is modeled as a spherical capped conical tip or a spherical capped regular three side pyramid tip {{to calculate the}} normal force needed for <b>the</b> nanochannel <b>scratching.</b> In order to further investigate <b>the</b> impact of <b>scratching</b> speed, scratching depth and <b>scratching</b> direction on <b>the</b> <b>scratching</b> process, <b>the</b> <b>scratching</b> simulation is implemented in LS-DYNA software, and a mesh-less method called smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) {{is used for the}} sample construction. Based on the theoretical and simulated analyses, the increase of <b>the</b> <b>scratching</b> speed, <b>the</b> <b>scratching</b> depth and <b>the</b> face angle will result in an increase in the normal force. At <b>the</b> same <b>scratching</b> depth, <b>the</b> normal forces of the spherical capped regular three side pyramid tip model are different in different scratching directions, which are in agreement with the theoretical calculations in the d 3 and d 4 directions. Moreover, the errors between the theoretical and simulated normal forces increase as the face angle increases...|$|R

In his report, dated 17 January 2010, Sutherst argued that <b>the</b> <b>scratch</b> marks in the red paintwork on the kitchen mantelpiece had been created after the crime-scene photographs had been taken. The prosecution alleged that the marks had been made during the struggle in the kitchen between Bamber and his father, as the silencer, attached to the rifle, had scratched against the mantelpiece. The prosecution said that paint chips identical to the paint on the mantelpiece were found on or inside the silencer.|$|E

40|$|Based on the self-developed three {{dimensional}} micro/nano machining system, {{the effects}} of machining parameters and sample material on micro/nano machining are investigated. The micro/nano machining system is mainly composed of the probe system and micro/nano positioning stage. The former is applied to control the normal load and the latter is utilized to realize high precision motion in the xy plane. A sample examination method is firstly introduced to estimate whether the sample is placed horizontally. The machining parameters include scratching direction, speed, cycles, normal load and feed. According to the experimental results, <b>the</b> <b>scratching</b> depth is significantly affected by the normal load in all four defined scratching directions but is rarely influenced by <b>the</b> <b>scratching</b> speed. <b>The</b> increase of <b>scratching</b> cycle number can increase <b>the</b> <b>scratching</b> depth as well as smooth the groove wall. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>scratching</b> tests of silicon and copper attest that the harder material is easier to be removed. In <b>the</b> <b>scratching</b> with different feed amount, the machining {{results indicate that the}} machined depth increases as the feed reduces. Further, a cubic polynomial is used to fit the experimental results to predict <b>the</b> <b>scratching</b> depth. With <b>the</b> selected machining parameters of scratching direction d 3 /d 4, scratching speed 5 μm/s and feed 0. 06 μm, some more micro structures including stair, sinusoidal groove, Chinese character ‘田’, ‘TJU’ and Chinese panda have been fabricated on the silicon substrate...|$|R

5|$|Julie Loeb (Isabella Grace) {{is found}} shot dead during a hunting {{expedition}} in the woods. Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop), begin to examine Julie. Megan notices a scratch on Julie's husband Martin (Jay Karnes) beginning to suspect he is her killer. After interviewing Martin, her step children Thomas (Joey Adams) and Erika (Natalie Floyd), their financial manager Alan Wright (Alex Fernandez), and Martin's ex-wife Alexandra (Jessica Tuck), she accuses Martin of the murder. Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan) tells Megan that Martin has phoned the mayor, {{and made a}} complaint about Megan's behaviour who accused him of Julie's death. Megan is taken off the case, but gets Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) to test a tissue found on the scene. Kate defends her actions to Peter, stating {{that she did not}} take her off the case due to her grudge with Megan, as she is dating Megan's ex-husband Todd Fleming (Jeffrey Nordling). Meanwhile, Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) interviews people to become a driver; a person who carries the bodies from the crime scene to the autopsy, and is ultimately unsuccessful. Bud Morris (John Carroll Lynch) and Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn) interview Martin once again, but are interrupted by Megan, who gets back the results from <b>the</b> <b>scratch,</b> once again accusing Martin of fighting with Julie, which he denies, as his blood matched some which was on her fingernail. Kate issues a final warning to Megan, so Megan takes another case. Bud and Samantha interview Alan, and find out that Julie was pregnant when she was shot.|$|E
5|$|Theramenes {{remained}} a general through 407 BC, but, in that year, when the Athenian defeat at Notium {{led to the}} downfall of Alcibiades and his political allies, Theramenes was not reelected. In the next year, however, he did sail as a trierarch in <b>the</b> <b>scratch</b> Athenian relief fleet sent out to relieve Conon, who had been blockaded with 40 triremes at Mytilene by Callicratidas. That relief force won a surprising victory over the more experienced Spartan force in the Battle of Arginusae, but {{in the wake of}} that battle Theramenes found himself {{in the middle of a}} massive controversy. At the end of the battle, the generals in command of the fleet had conferred to decide on their next steps. Several pressing concerns presented themselves; 50 Peloponnesian ships under Eteonicus {{remained a}}t Mytilene, blockading Conon, and decisive action by the Athenians could lead to the destruction of that force as well, but, at the same time, ships needed to be dispatched to recover the sailors of the twenty five Athenian triremes sunk or disabled in the battle. Accordingly, all eight generals, with the larger part of the fleet, set out for Mytilene, while a rescue force under Thrasybulus and Theramenes, both of whom were trierarchs in this battle but had served as generals in prior campaigns, remained behind to pick up the survivors and retrieve corpses for burial. At this point, however, a severe storm blew up, and both of these forces were driven back to shore. Eteonicus escaped, and a great number of Athenian sailors—estimates as to the precise figure have ranged from near 1,000 to as many as 5,000—drowned.|$|E

40|$|Line {{scratches}} {{are common}} artefacts in old motion pictures that may produce a very annoying {{effect on the}} viewer. In this paper, we will introduce a new method for fast detection and high quality restoration {{of this kind of}} degradation. Our detection method relies on the statistical characteristics of the intensity of pixels in <b>the</b> <b>scratched</b> areas of frames. For high quality restoration of <b>the</b> <b>scratches</b> we use a mixed adaptive stochastic AR-Median model to restore <b>the</b> <b>scratched</b> areas. <b>The</b> proposed detection algorithm is fast and more efficient compared to the other available approaches. The main contribution of our restoration algorithm is its ability to jointly adapt the image model to the data and concurrently restore the missing pixels. only to <b>the</b> <b>scratched</b> parts of <b>the</b> images. So it is necessary to detect the positions of <b>the</b> <b>scratched</b> pixels by a so-called detection algorithm, before applying any restoration algorithm. The main problem in the detection of line scratches is their similarity to vertical features of the image. In some cases even for a human observer it may be hard to distinguish between a line scratch and a vertical feature (e. g., in Fig. 1 look at <b>the</b> line <b>scratch</b> in <b>the</b> image near the door edge and its similarity to the door frame). As mentioned above, because of the mechanism of <b>the</b> line <b>scratch</b> production, a line scratch usually remains in a similar positions in the consecutive frames; and covers {{a large part of the}} image...|$|R

25|$|Glue smears and {{droplets}} {{are sometimes}} present around the joints of furniture. They {{can be removed}} {{using a combination of}} scraping, scrubbing and sanding.
