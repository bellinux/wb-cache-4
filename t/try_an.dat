5|$|Gail Kim {{defended the}} TNA Women's Knockout Championship against Awesome Kong in a No Disqualification match. It {{began with the}} two {{fighting}} throughout the crowd, before entering the ring. There, Kong performed her signature Awesome Bomb maneuver on the referee and followed by hitting him with a steel chair. Kim took the steel chair from Kong, bashed her over the back and head with it, before getting a near-fall which was counted by a replacement referee. Kong then proceeded to <b>try</b> <b>an</b> Awesome Bomb on the second referee, but was stopped by Kim as she attempted a roll-up pin {{which led to the}} three count and the retaining of the TNA Women's Knockout Championship at twelve minutes and forty-four seconds. Following the contest, Kong and Kim fought at ringside before it was broken up by security.|$|E
5|$|Leeds {{finished}} {{just five}} points above the Second Division relegation {{zone in the}} 1960–61 season and Taylor resigned; his replacement, Don Revie, was promoted from the United first team, and initially he was not fond of Charlton. Revie played Charlton up front {{at the start of}} the 1961–62 season, but he soon moved him back to centre-half after he proved ineffective as a centre-forward. He soon became frustrated and difficult to manage, feeling in limbo playing for a club seemingly going nowhere whilst his younger brother was enjoying great success at Manchester United. Revie told Charlton that he was prepared to let him go in 1962, but never actually transfer listed him. Liverpool manager Bill Shankly failed to meet the £30,000 Leeds demanded for Charlton and though Manchester United manager Matt Busby was initially willing to pay the fee he eventually decided to instead <b>try</b> <b>an</b> untested youngster at centre-half. During these discussions Charlton refused to sign a new contract at Leeds, but felt frustrated by Busby's hesitance and so signed a new contract with Leeds whilst making a promise to Revie to be more professional in his approach.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee {{attempted}} to answer Tech's score in its following possession. The Hokies' kickoff {{resulted in a}} touchback, so the Volunteers began from their 20-yard line. Montario Hardesty gained a first down with a 10-yard run, then Crompton gained another first down with an 11-yard pass. Tennessee continued to advance on running plays and a 14-yard pass by Crompton, pushing the ball inside the Tech 30-yard line. Once there, however, the Hokies rallied by sacking Crompton for a seven-yard loss. A two-yard run and an incomplete pass kept Tennessee from gaining another first down, setting up a fourth down. Rather than <b>try</b> <b>an</b> offensive play and possibly gain a first down or turn the ball over on downs, Tennessee punted, forcing Virginia Tech's offense to start from its 11-yard line.|$|E

5|$|The {{target of}} the Confederate assault {{was the center of}} the Union Army of the Potomac's II Corps, {{commanded}} by Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock. Directly in the center was the division of Brig. Gen. John Gibbon with the brigades of Brig. Gen. William Harrow, Col. Norman J. Hall, and Brig. Gen. Alexander S. Webb. (On the night of July 2, Meade correctly predicted to Gibbon at a council of war that Lee would <b>try</b> <b>an</b> attack on Gibbon's sector the following morning.) To the north of this position were brigades from the division of Brig. Gen. Alexander Hays, and to the south was Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday's division of the I Corps, including the 2nd Vermont Brigade of Brig. Gen. George J. Stannard and the 121st Pennsylvania under the command of Col. Chapman Biddle. Meade's headquarters were just behind the II Corps line, in the small house owned by the widow Lydia Leister.|$|E
5|$|Washington again {{proposed}} to assault Boston in October, but his officers {{thought it best}} {{to wait until the}} harbor had frozen over. In February, when the water had frozen between Roxbury and Boston Common, Washington thought that in spite of his shortage in powder he would <b>try</b> <b>an</b> assault by rushing across the ice; but his officers again advised against it. Washington's desire to launch an attack on Boston arose from his fear that his army would desert in the winter, and how easily he knew that Howe could break the lines of his army in its present condition. He had not yet learned how completely he could trust in Howe's inactivity; he abandoned an attack across the ice with great reluctance in exchange for a more cautious plan, to fortify Dorchester Heights using cannon arrived from Fort Ticonderoga.|$|E

50|$|In early {{forms of}} rugby football, {{the point of}} the game was to score goals. <b>A</b> <b>try</b> goal was awarded for {{grounding}} the ball in the opponents in-goal area.

25|$|The {{right of}} a German court to <b>try</b> <b>an</b> Italian bishop was very {{controversial}} and presaged the Investiture Controversy that characterised the reigns of Henry's son and grandson. Henry continued from there on to Saxony and held imperial courts at Quedlinburg, Merseburg (in June), and Meissen. At the first, he made his daughter Beatrice {{from his first marriage}} abbess, and at the second he ended the strife between the dux Bomeraniorum and Casimir of Poland. This is one of the earliest, or perhaps the earliest, recording of the name of Pomerania, whose duke, Zemuzil, brought gifts.|$|E
25|$|Other {{innovations}} in enrollment practices, included allowing {{colleges and universities}} to admit students with good academic records but relatively low entrance-examination scores. Some colleges were allowed to <b>try</b> <b>an</b> experimental student recommendation system - fixed at 2 {{percent of the total}} enrollment for regular colleges and 5 percent for teachers' colleges - instead of the traditional entrance examination. A minimum national examination score was established for admission to specific departments at specially designated colleges and universities, and the minimum score for admission to other universities was set by provincial-level authorities. Key universities established separate classes for minorities. When several applicants attained the minimum test score, the school had the option of making a selection, a policy that gave university faculty and administrators a certain amount of discretion but still protected admission according to academic ability.|$|E

[...] Sepinwall concluded that he is [...] "always a fan of single-story Simpsons episodes, as well as ones built around an emotional issue facing a member of the family, and this has both – in addition to being funny and sweet and clever in its depiction of the Best Cruise Ever." ...|$|E
