5|$|The {{first modern}} crash-related fire was {{reported}} in China in May 2012, after a high-speed car crashed into a BYD e6 taxi in Shenzhen. The second reported incident occurred in the United States on October 1, 2013, when a Tesla Model S caught fire after the electric car hit metal debris on a highway in Kent, Washington state, and the debris punctured one of 16 modules within the battery pack. A second reported fire occurred on October 18, 2013 in Merida, Mexico. In this case the vehicle was being driven at high speed through a roundabout and crashed through a wall and into a tree. On November 6, 2013, a Tesla Model S being driven on Interstate 24 near Murfreesboro, Tennessee caught fire after it struck a <b>tow</b> <b>hitch</b> on the roadway, causing damage beneath the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|On November 6, 2013 another fire {{broke out}} after a Model S struck a <b>tow</b> <b>hitch</b> on the roadway, causing damage beneath the vehicle.

2500|$|Starting in 1971, the AMI-built Matador was {{available}} in sedan and wagon body styles. Standard equipment included automatic transmission, power steering, power windows, air conditioning, and an AM radio. The engine was AMC's [...] V8, following its introduction in the 1970 Rebel. Among the options were an exterior mounted sun visor, vinyl roof cover, <b>tow</b> <b>hitch,</b> and mud flaps. The cars were targeted at the top market segment and advertised as [...] "the American luxury limousine made for Australians" [...] and built for Australian conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Honda lists a [...] towing {{capacity}} for the Ridgeline while accommodating an additional [...] to [...] (depending on trim level) of payload. [...] All models {{came with a}} heavy-duty radiator, integrated transmission and power steering coolers, dual 160W radiator fans, and were pre-wired for an electric trailer brake controller and a seven-pin or less trailer wiring harness. [...] Also, depending on trim level and model year, a class III <b>tow</b> <b>hitch</b> with a four-pin flat and/or seven-pin blade trailer wiring harness was either standard equipment or dealer installed options.|$|E
50|$|Across Europe around 25% of {{vehicles}} have tow balls fitted—but there are distinct regional variations, being {{more common in}} Benelux and Scandinavia. In Sweden, around 2.2 million cars of around 4.3 million (just over 50%) have tow balls. In the United Kingdom the popularity of caravans is responsible for a high percentage number of 4x4 (SUV) type vehicles being fitted with <b>tow</b> <b>hitches.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Type 1 Ho-Ha {{had a pair}} of road {{wheels in}} front, {{supported}} by a pair of short caterpillar tracks to the rear. [...] It was equipped a tow coupling in the front and a <b>towing</b> <b>hitch</b> at the rear to haul artillery or a supply trailer. The maximum armor thickness was 8 mm with sloping armor plates. As with the Type 1 Ho-Ki, the hull was welded construction and it was [...] "open-topped".|$|R

The first crash related fire was reported in China in May 2012, after a high-speed car crashed into a BYD e6 taxi in Shenzhen. Two incidents occurred with the Tesla Model S in October 2013, one when a Model S caught fire after the electric car hit metal debris on a highway in Kent, Washington, and another involving a loss of control and collision with a tree in Merida, Mexico. A Tesla Model S being driven on a highway near Murfreesboro, Tennessee caught fire in November 2013 after it struck a <b>tow</b> <b>hitch</b> on the roadway, causing damage beneath the vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|The {{drivetrain}} {{consisted of}} one engine, the [...] straight-6-cylinder, {{in conjunction with}} a three-speed automatic transmission (a version of Chrysler's A998), with Dana 30 and Dana 35 differentials. All 1980 Eagles came standard with a permanent four-wheel-drive system that employed a New Process 119 transfer case that had a viscous fluid coupling that allowed the four-wheel-drive system to operate on wet or dry pavement without causing undue suspension and drivetrain wear. Optional trailer towing packages were available for handling trailers weighing up to [...] that included a weight distributing (equalizing) <b>tow</b> <b>hitch,</b> seven-connector wiring harness, wiring, auxiliary transmission oil cooler, 3.54 axle ratio, and required the optional heavy-duty battery and automatic load-leveling air shocks.|$|E

50|$|In French service, this {{weapon is}} {{normally}} towed by the VTM 120 (Véhicule Tracteur Mortier de 120 mm), a wheeled armored vehicle {{that is a}} derivative of the VAB 4x4 series of armored personnel carrier. Towing is accomplished by a <b>towing</b> <b>hitch</b> that is screwed onto the muzzle of the weapon. The VTM 120 also carries 70 rounds for the mortar and offers basic ballistic protection from small arms fire and shrapnel for the crew. The RT-61 can also be towed by the AMX-10 TM (Tracteur de Mortier), which is {{a version of the}} AMX-10P tracked APC. The Japan Ground Self-Defense Force have a self-propelled version of the RT-61 with 50 rounds, the Type 96.|$|R
5000|$|The first-generation 2002-2005 model years TrailBlazer {{is based}} on a truck {{platform}} called GMT360, with all models having four-wheel drive as an option with both automatic engagement and the more traditional [...] "4 High" [...] and [...] "4 Low" [...] gearings, except the SS model which features an All wheel drive system. The TrailBlazer features an independent front suspension, and a five-link rear suspension. A G80 locking rear differential is available as an option on all models except for the SS which has a G86 LSD standard. An LTZ version, has upgraded interior features (leather), better sound system (Bose), alloy wheels, four-wheel disc brakes. All TrailBlazers came factory equipped with a detachable <b>towing</b> <b>hitch.</b>|$|R
50|$|Standard {{features}} included remote keyless entry, tilt-and-telescopic steering wheel, {{and high}} solar energy-absorbing glass (HSEA) {{on the windshield}} and front windows. All 2004-2007 Siennas had a factory <b>tow</b> package (<b>hitch</b> kit and trailer lighting connections not included) and a 3500 lb towing capacity.|$|R
50|$|Cars can be {{equipped}} with a trailer <b>tow</b> <b>hitch</b> with a removable tow ball.|$|E

50|$|Semi-trailer - 1 axle (2 wheels), {{without the}} front axle {{but have a}} landing gear. Large {{semi-trailer}} of truck size is designed for connection via the fifth wheel on the tractor unit or the semi-trailer truck. Small semi-trailer such as travel trailer and boat trailer is design for connection via a <b>tow</b> <b>hitch</b> of a passenger vehicle. Either the fifth wheel or the <b>tow</b> <b>hitch</b> takes up to half to load of the semi-trailer.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} factor in towing safety is tongue weight, the weight with which the trailer presses down on the <b>tow</b> vehicle's <b>hitch.</b> Insufficient tongue weight can cause the trailer to sway back and forth when towed. Too much tongue weight can cause problems with the tow vehicle.|$|R
50|$|TSP or Trailer Stability Program is {{one feature}} {{which has been}} added to some vehicles, to help correct the ‘snaking’ action of a trailer. With such {{advanced}} technology, some braking systems have even evolved further by being operated electronically, without the need for hydraulics. Braking can become more controlled with faster braking efficiency when towing. Some suspension systems can now detect a trailer and allow for a more level towing adjustment when the load is applied on the <b>towing</b> <b>hitch.</b> ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control) systems are meant to ‘detect’ a trailer {{in order to create a}} greater braking distance between vehicles.It might be considered unwise to bypass such vehicles' trailer detection systems as these vehicles may be designed to behave in a different way when a trailer is attached.|$|R
50|$|A {{jockey wheel}} is a {{retractable}} adjustable-height wheel {{used on the}} front of trailers with either a single axle (two running wheels) or more close-coupled axles at or near the centre of gravity whereby without additional support, the trailer would not remain 'level'. The jockey wheel is situated close to the <b>towing</b> <b>hitch</b> and has a built-in screw jack to enable the trailer nose to be lifted over the tow ball of a car or other powered vehicle. The screw jack can then be used to gently lower the trailer nose onto the tow ball. Once securely attached to the towing vehicle, the jockey wheel's jacking action is fully retracted for stowage. The jockey wheel is also unclamped and lifted as far as possible to give the greatest ground clearance before reclamping prior to a journey being made.|$|R
50|$|A trailer hitch, fifth-wheel {{coupling}} or {{other type of}} <b>tow</b> <b>hitch</b> is needed to draw a trailer with a car, truck or other traction engine.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} forms of <b>tow</b> <b>hitch,</b> {{including}} a ball hitch, tow bar, pintle and lunette ring, three-point, fifth wheel, coupling, and drawbar, among others.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hitch</b> <b>tow</b> {{trucks are}} mostly sized for cars and light duty trucks. Larger versions, with a long, {{weighted}} body and heavier duty engines, transmissions, and tow hooks, {{may be used}} for towing of disabled buses, truck tractors, or large trucks. The artificial sizing and weighting must be designed to withstand the greater weight of the towed vehicle, which might otherwise tip the tow truck back.|$|R
5000|$|A weight-distributing hitch is a [...] "load leveling" [...] hitch. It is a hitch setup {{mounted on}} the tow vehicle that uses spring bars and chains under tension to {{distribute}} part of the trailer's hitch weight from the towing vehicle's rear axle to the towing vehicle's front axle and to the trailer's axle(s). It can help reduce trailer sway and hop. Trailer hop can jerk the tow vehicle. Trailer sway is sometimes called [...] "fish tailing". At high speeds, trailer sway can become dangerous. Most vehicle manufacturers will only allow a maximum trailer capacity of 5000 lb and 500 lb of tongue weight without using a weight-distributing <b>hitch.</b> <b>Tow</b> vehicles often have square receiver sockets to accept weight distributing hitches.|$|R
50|$|A {{trailer hitch}} or <b>tow</b> <b>hitch</b> is a device {{mounted on a}} {{motorcycle}} that enables it to tow a motorcycle trailer. Legislation often restricts them to carrying baggage and not passengers.|$|E
5000|$|Ringfeders {{are used}} in nearly all aspects of world transport, the most common being LGVs (Large Goods Vehicles) {{throughout}} Europe, and road trains in Australia. America uses a similar product known as a [...] "Pintle Hook" [...] or <b>tow</b> <b>hitch.</b>|$|E
50|$|The GMT800-based Suburbans were {{introduced}} in late 1999 for the 2000 model year. They were sold in two series: 1/2-ton 1500 and 3/4-ton 2500. Suburbans came in Base, LS and LT trims. Optional was pushbutton 4WD with low-range transfer case. A <b>tow</b> <b>hitch</b> with trailer wiring plug was optional.|$|E
5000|$|County Rider (France, 1993): Intended {{to appeal}} to equestrians, the County Rider was {{equipped}} with a rear floor liner, rub-strips and wheel-arch protectors, mudflaps, floor mats, an adjustable <b>tow</b> <b>hitch,</b> and a saddle rack. Available as either a three- or five-door, all were painted green with special decals.|$|E
50|$|On November 6, 2013 another fire {{broke out}} after a Model S struck a <b>tow</b> <b>hitch</b> on the roadway, causing damage beneath the vehicle. The {{incidents}} led Tesla to extend its vehicle warranty to cover fire damage and to apply a software update to increase ground clearance when operating at highway speed.|$|E
5000|$|The 2009 {{model year}} brought more unusual {{standard}} {{equipment such as}} a seven-pin blade trailer wiring harness for Canadian models and a class III <b>tow</b> <b>hitch</b> for all models. [...] The 2013 model year brought with it a rearview camera to round out the unusual list of standard equipment for the Honda Ridgeline.|$|E
5000|$|Movement of {{the yard}} ramp - Yard ramps are {{typically}} moved around using a simple tow bar which is pinned into the <b>tow</b> <b>hitch</b> {{on the back of}} most standard fork trucks, though some designs offer alternative methods, such as pushing the ramp around using pockets which accept the standard forks of a fork truck.|$|E
