25|$|Back in the fort, Boone {{outlined}} the situation. The consensus was to fight rather than surrender. The {{decision was made}} to prolong the negotiations with Blackfish as long as possible, since reinforcements from Virginia were expected. Boone and Major William Bailey Smith went outside again and told Blackfish that they feared that the trip to Detroit would be <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> the women and children. Blackfish pointed out that he had brought 40 horses to transport those unable to walk. Boone asked for another day to consult with the others. Leaders from the two sides smoked a ceremonial pipe together to mark the peace agreement, and then broke off negotiations for the day.|$|E
25|$|Tobacco was popular, {{both for}} {{personal}} use, and for trading with Indians and other pioneers. Each person brought {{at least two}} changes of clothes and multiple pairs of boots (two to three pairs often wore out on the trip). About 25 pounds of soap was recommended for a party of four, for bathing and washing clothes. A washboard and tub were usually brought for washing clothes. Wash days typically occurred {{once or twice a}} month, or less, depending on availability of good grass, water, and fuel. Most wagons carried tents for sleeping, though in good weather most would sleep outside. A thin fold-up mattress, blankets, pillows, canvas, or rubber gutta percha ground covers were used for sleeping. Sometimes an unfolded feather bed mattress was brought for the wagon, if there were pregnant women or very young children along. The wagons had no springs, and the ride along the trail was very rough. Despite modern depictions, hardly anyone actually rode in the wagons; it was too dusty, too rough, and <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> the livestock.|$|E
25|$|The {{first game}} was held Thanksgiving Day in 1933, an {{exhibition}} contest against the Rochester Arpeakos. A crowd of 10,000 attended {{the game to}} watch Conacher play his first competitive football game in Canada in ten years. He did not disappoint, scoring two touchdowns and setting up a third for the Chefs, and was hailed as the game's star despite an 18–15 loss. Toronto lost a return match in Rochester, but {{in the third and}} final game of their season, the Chefs defeated a team from Buffalo at Toronto by a score of 18–0. Conacher was again the star, rushing for two touchdowns and scoring 13 of his team's points. He organized the team for a second year in 1934, known as the Wrigley Aromints due to new sponsorship, and again played an exhibition schedule as the team remained unaffiliated with any league. The team again played three games, winning all three. However, at the age of 34 years, Conacher found that the game was <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> his body physically, and neither he nor his team returned for a third season.|$|E

25|$|Lynn's race ended {{early on}} lap 25 {{when he stopped}} on track with a {{driveshaft}} failure. Di Grassi was separated by the two Mahindra cars of Rosenqvist and Heidfeld, and battled the former while also defending from the latter. Dillmann and Gasly overtook Carroll {{to move into the}} points-scoring positions on lap 29. As the lead group established themselves, attention focused on di Grassi's duel with Rosenqvist. Di Grassi was cautious as he attempted to find room to pass Rosenqvist, but kept pressuring him. On lap 33, Rosenqvist locked his tires turning into the turn two chicane, causing him to lose control of his car's rear-end, and drifted into the corner's exit barrier. His error promoted di Grassi into fifth place; the impact removed his rear wing, prompting race officials to display a black flag with an orange circle, requiring him to make a pit stop for repairs. After passing Dillmann, Gasly was at this point running in seventh position. Heidfeld's right-rear suspension collapsed after hitting the turn three inside kerb <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> the 37th lap. He stopped on track, triggering the safety car's deployment, and reducing the time gaps within the field. Heidfeld pushed his car back to pit lane without assistance from marshals.|$|E
25|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in cloudy weather with occasional rain showers. Michael Schumacher clinched his seventh pole position of his career, his first at the circuit, with a time of 1:14.266. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Coulthard, who was one-tenth of a second slower and was helped by running in the slipstream of teammate Häkkinen on the main straight. Häkkinen qualified third and stated that he was not unhappy with his starting position. Barrichello qualified fourth, three-tenths of a second behind Michael Schumacher, and said he had more grip in his car to improve his time. Trulli qualified fifth. Button took sixth and was happy with his effort despite encountering a yellow flag on his third run and admitted to pushing <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> his fourth attempt. Frentzen slid onto the grass during the session and managed to record the seventh quickest time. Villeneuve who secured eighth believed he could have set a faster time as he spun while on a quick lap. Diniz took ninth having removed some downforce which improved the feel of his car. Ralf Schumacher rounded out the top ten having suffered his spin on his fourth run. Wurz qualified eleventh and said that he was happy with his car. Ricardo Zonta qualified twelfth, blaming his car for his qualifying performance. He was ahead of Verstappen and Salo. Fisichella, who started 15th, stated that understeer and poor grip prevented him from setting a faster lap time. He managed to qualify ahead of Heidfeld and Irvine, who spun during the session. Arrows driver Pedro de la Rosa, Herbert and Alesi filled the next three positions; the latter had a lack of running due to a pneumatic valve system failure in his engine. The two Minardi drivers qualified {{at the rear of the}} grid; Gastón Mazzacane in front of Gené.|$|E

500|$|Simpson {{began working}} with his father as a {{draughtsman}} at the glass factory in Harworth. He was riding well; although not selected by Great Britain for the amateur world championships, he made the 4,000-metre team pursuit squad for the 1956 Olympics. In mid-September, Simpson competed for two weeks in Eastern Europe against Russian and Italian teams {{to prepare for the}} Olympics. The seven-rider contingent began with races in Leningrad, continuing to Moscow before finishing in Sofia. He was nicknamed [...] "the Sparrow" [...] by the Soviet press because of his slender build. The following month he was in Melbourne for the Olympics, where the team qualified for the team-pursuit semi-finals against Italy; they were confident of defeating South Africa and France but lost to Italy, taking the bronze medal. Simpson blamed himself for the loss for pushing <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> a turn and being unable to recover for the next.|$|E
500|$|Cinefantastiques Dale Kutzera {{gave the}} episode 2.5 out of 4 stars in his review, {{saying that the}} episode failed to define the Kazon as an enemy. [...] Kutzera's {{suspension}} of disbelief was rocked by the casting of Aron Eisenberg (who Kutzera felt was too synonymous with his [...] character, Nog), and the reuse of the immediately-identifiable Vasquez Rocks shooting location. [...] In his book Delta Quadrant: The unofficial guide to Voyager, David McIntee also lamented Eisenberg's recognizability from his other Star Trek series. [...] For the episode itself, McIntee felt the first half has some interesting potential in the culture clashes presented, but that it fell <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> the [...] "enemies-must-team-up-to-survive" [...] cliché; he gave the episode a 7 out of 10, calling it [...] "watchable, and occasionally quite strong." [...] Reviewers Lance Parkin and Mark Jones point out continuity errors (Chakotay's medicine bundle should have been destroyed with the shuttle but is then seen again in the final scene), but thought the episode was an [...] "efficient piece of storytelling" [...] though occasionally formulaic.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of her fashion and style {{has been extensively}} written about by both designers and fashion stylists and has generally proved favorable. American designer Marc Jacobs wrote of Sevigny in 2001: [...] "The fashion world is fascinated by her. Because not only is she talented, young and attractive, she stands out {{in a sea of}} often clichéd looking actresses." [...] In terms of her own personal style, Sevigny cited the Australian film Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975), which features schoolgirls dressed in elaborate Victorian clothing, as a major inspiration; she has also cited it as one of her favorite films. She has also been outspoken in her favoritism of vintage clothing over designer pieces: [...] "I still prefer to buy vintage over spending it all on one designer", she told The Times. [...] "I'll go to Resurrection or Decades and be like, 'Oh, I'm going to buy everything,' but {{a lot of it is}} extremely expensive, so I'll go to Wasteland and satisfy that urge and it's not <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> the pocketbook.

500|$|Further success came to Adams {{when she}} reteamed with David O. Russell {{in the crime}} film American Hustle, co-starring Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, and Jennifer Lawrence. Inspired by the 1970s Abscam scandal, the film {{featured}} Adams in the rare glamorous part of a seductive con artist, though she played it so that [...] "everything felt justified and it didn't feel like {{she was just a}} sexy sociopath". She collaborated closely with Bale to build their characters and made off-screen suggestions to Russell, including for a scene in which she is aggressively kissed on the lips by her lover's wife (played by Lawrence). The experience was grueling for Adams, who later admitted that Russell had been <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> her and had made her cry frequently; she said that she regretted bringing such a negative experience home to her daughter. American Hustle was acclaimed by critics; Manohla Dargis of The New York Times believed that Adams [...] "goes deeper here than she's ever been allowed to" [...] and wrote that she had successfully [...] "turn an unpredictable character into a thrillingly wild one". She won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical and received her fifth Oscar nomination (her first for Best Actress). Her and American Hustle were deemed by critics to be among the best films of 2013, and they were both nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.|$|E
500|$|Nick de Semlyen from Empire {{considered}} it an average film, saying [...] "It's familiar ground for anyone who's seen Black Book or Sophie Scholl, but director Ole Christian Madsen steers a skilful course, keeping things grim {{but not to}} an off-putting extent, bringing a David Lynch-esque vibe to Flame's hotel dalliances with a shady lady and pulling off an incredible death scene {{for one of the}} leads." [...] Noel Murray of The A.V. Club criticized it for [...] "hammer <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> the shopworn theme of how war sickens souls. Far more interesting is Flame & Citrons other theme: the idea that war turns the notion of 'shades of gray' into a luxury". V.A. Musetto, for the New York Post, commented that, although it [...] "features well-choreographed shootouts and assassinations", its [...] "script is too melodramatic and complicated for its own good". Burr mostly praised it but said that [...] "Madsen eventually loses his way", stating that there was [...] "not enough" [...] information about Citron and that the film [...] "feels packed with events and frustratingly unfocused". Derakhshani argued that it [...] "has some rough, tedious patches– at 130 minutes, it's simply too long. And its reiteration of Hollywood cliches isn't always successful. Regardless, it is, along with Paul Verhoeven's Black Book, one of the most accomplished films {{to come out of the}} recent wave of neoclassic and revisionist WWII films".|$|E
500|$|Felton (Daniel Baldwin) and Howard (Melissa Leo) {{investigate}} {{the murder of}} an Iowa woman who {{was shot to death}} in front of her husband Robert Ellison (Robin Williams) and two young children during a stick-up. Since the victims are tourists, the case becomes a [...] "red ball" [...] and receives considerable attention from the press, city officials and top police brass. Bayliss (Kyle Secor) tries to interview the two young children, but Ellison stops him, protesting that the experience is <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> them. After obtaining information from street thugs, the police arrest Marvin (Antonio Charity), who possesses 45-caliber bullets matching those used in the shooting. Marvin tells the detectives that he's a [...] "stone stick-up man" [...] who has robbed dozens of people and never shot anyone because people don't argue with a [...]45-carrying man, and also that he knows he will spend decades in prison anyway because he was involved in the shooting so there is no reason he would lie about being the shooter. A mournful Ellison overhears Felton making jokes about the investigation and bragging about the overtime he expects to receive from it. He angrily demands Felton be thrown off the case, but Gee (Yaphet Kotto) calms him down by explaining the police have to be detached from the victims because they encounter so many. Ellison takes his children back to their hotel room, where his daughter Abby (Julia Devin) is in denial about her mother's death, and his son Matt (Jake Gyllenhaal) angrily refuses to talk to his father.|$|E
