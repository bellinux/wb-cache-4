40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method to {{increase}} precision of sampling oscilloscopes time-base then using a new hybrid time-base architecture. The traditional time-base of sampling oscilloscope has three kinds of <b>time</b> <b>base</b> error including <b>time</b> <b>base</b> drift, <b>time</b> <b>base</b> jitter and <b>time</b> <b>base</b> distortion. New hybrid time-base architecture allows to minimize this kind of errors...|$|R
50|$|<b>Time</b> <b>bases</b> {{are used}} by radar systems to {{determine}} range to a target, by comparing the current location along the <b>time</b> <b>base</b> to the <b>time</b> of arrival of radio echoes. Analog television systems using CRTs had two <b>time</b> <b>bases,</b> one for deflecting the beam horizontally in a rapid movement, and another pulling it down the screen 60 times per second. Oscilloscopes often have several <b>time</b> <b>bases,</b> but these may be more flexible function generators able to produce many waveforms {{as well as a}} simple <b>time</b> <b>base.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Time</b> <b>base</b> {{correction}} is {{a technique}} to reduce or eliminate errors caused by mechanical instability present in analog recordings on mechanical media. Without <b>time</b> <b>base</b> correction, a signal from a videotape recorder (VTR) or videocassette recorder (VCR) cannot be mixed with other, more time stable devices found in television studios and post-production facilities. Most broadcast quality VCRs have simple <b>time</b> <b>base</b> correctors built in though external <b>time</b> <b>base</b> correctors (TBCs) are often used.|$|R

5|$|During Watts's lifetime, European culture {{had begun}} to {{question}} the concept of hope. A new school of philosophy at the <b>time,</b> <b>based</b> on the thinking of Friedrich Nietzsche, saw hope as a negative attribute that encouraged humanity to expend their energies on futile efforts. The Long Depression of the 1870s wrecked both the economy and confidence of Britain, and Watts felt that the encroaching mechanisation of daily life, {{and the importance of}} material prosperity to Britain's increasingly dominant middle class, were making modern life increasingly soulless.|$|E

5|$|In July 2009, {{the policy}} of {{time-based}} development freezes on a two-year cycle was announced. Time-based freezes are intended to blend the predictability of <b>time</b> <b>based</b> releases with Debian's policy of feature based releases, and to reduce overall freeze time. The Squeeze cycle {{was going to be}} especially short; however, this initial schedule was abandoned. In September 2010, the backports service became official, providing more recent versions of some software for the stable release.|$|E
5000|$|To {{ensure the}} <b>time</b> <b>base</b> began its {{sweep of the}} screen at the right time, the signal {{included}} several special modulations. With each line {{there was a brief}} period, the [...] "front porch" [...] and [...] "back porch" [...] that caused the signal to go negative briefly. This triggered the horizontal <b>time</b> <b>base</b> to start its sweep across the screen, ensuring that the lines started on the left of the display. A much longer but otherwise similar signal, the vertical blanking interval caused the vertical <b>time</b> <b>base</b> to start, with any lengthy delay causing the <b>time</b> <b>base</b> to trigger.|$|R

5|$|In {{a typical}} LFR {{instrument}} approach procedure, final approach would begin {{over the range}} station, with a turn to a specific course. The pilot would descend to a specified minimum descent altitude (MDA), and if the airport was not in sight within a specified <b>time</b> (<b>based</b> on ground speed), a missed approach procedure would be initiated. In the depicted Joliet, IL LFR approach procedure, minimum descent altitude could be as low as 300 feet AGL, and required minimum visibility one mile, depending on aircraft type.|$|E

40|$|An {{approach}} to checkpointing and rollback recovery in a distributed computing system using a common <b>time</b> <b>base</b> is proposed.

This common <b>time</b> <b>base</b> is coupled {{with the idea of}} pseudo-recovery points to develop a checkpointing algorithm that has the following advantages: reduced wait for commitment for establishing recovery lines, fewer messages to be exchanged, and less memory requirement. These advantages are assessed quantitatively by developing a probabilistic model...|$|R

5|$|By August 1980 Umboh had {{recovered}} enough strength to direct his next film, Disini Cinta Pertama Kali Bersemi (Here Love Bloomed for the First <b>Time),</b> <b>based</b> {{on the novel}} by Mira W. Shortly before directing Putri Seorang Jenderal (A General's Daughter; an adaptation of Motinggo Busye's novel of the same name) in 1981, Umboh divorced Roemokoy. Umboh converted to Islam in 1983 and {{changed his name to}} Ahmad Salim. On 24 August of the following year Umboh married Inne Ermina Chomid, a police officer's daughter of Sundanese descent 28 years his junior. As his health was improving, Umboh continued to make films, including Kabut Perkawinan (The Fog of Wedlock; 1984). Umboh and Chomid had a son, William Umboh Ikhsan Salim, in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Lihou was an {{important}} location for a commercially significant industry based around the harvesting of seaweed (or vraic in the local language, Guernésiais). Records suggest considerable activity {{as early as the}} beginning of the nineteenth century. The value of the seaweed as a fertiliser was so great that in 1815 Eleazor Le Marchant, lieutenant bailiff of Guernsey and owner of Lihou, initiated a court case to prevent islanders from drying seaweed on the beaches of Lihou. The case eventually led to new regulations issued in 1818 by the Bailiwick legislature, known as the Chief Pleas at the <b>time,</b> <b>based</b> on a review of ancient royal decrees. However, the Royal Court of Guernsey ruled in favour of the islanders in 1821, with the effect that permission to harvest seaweed on Lihou was granted to inhabitants of the parishes of St Peters and St Saviours. More than a century later, in 1927, a factory was established on the island to produce iodine from the seaweed.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Erhard Kietz {{authored}} a Summary of Problems and Activities in Electronic <b>Time</b> <b>Base</b> Correction, released for Ampex Corporation on June 15, 1960. Here again, {{the concern}} is an exact <b>time</b> <b>base</b> with jitter of less than {{a tenth of a}} microsecond, without which video recorders cannot function.|$|R
25|$|The X-axis of {{the system}} was fed by a <b>time</b> <b>base</b> {{generator}} that pulled the beam {{from left to right}} across the screen. Normally a <b>time</b> <b>base</b> is triggered to start its sweep as soon as the signal from the transmitter is seen, but as noted above, this would not provide the accuracy required for this role. Instead, the <b>time</b> <b>base</b> was set to span the screen at a much faster rate, representing only a portion of the signal's overall flight time. Triggering the <b>time</b> <b>base</b> was accomplished using a very accurate oil-filled potentiometer which exponentially increased the charge in a capacitor bank until it reached a trigger value. A very complex grounding system was needed to ensure the accuracy of the voltages leaving the potentiometer system, as any stray voltages could overwhelm the signal.|$|R
5000|$|Implicit in {{the idea}} of <b>time</b> <b>base</b> {{correction}} is that there must be some target <b>time</b> <b>base</b> that the corrector is aiming for. There are two <b>time</b> <b>bases</b> commonly used. The first method is to make the frames, fields and lines come out smoothly and uniformly, at the rates specified by the standards using an oscillator for time reference. The alternative to this method is to align the frames, fields, and lines with some external signal, a procedure called genlocking. [...] Genlocking allows sources that are not themselves genlock-capable to be used with production switchers and A/B roll editing equipment. Stand-alone broadcast model <b>time</b> <b>base</b> correctors typically will genlock the signal to an external sync reference, and also allow the brightness, contrast, chrominance, and color phase ("tint" [...] or [...] "hue") to be adjusted.|$|R
5|$|In 1070 Sweyn II of Denmark {{arrived to}} take {{personal}} command of his fleet and renounced the earlier agreement to withdraw, sending troops into the Fens {{to join forces}} with English rebels led by Hereward the Wake, at that <b>time</b> <b>based</b> on the Isle of Ely. Sweyn soon accepted a further payment of Danegeld from William, and returned home. After {{the departure of the}} Danes the Fenland rebels remained at large, protected by the marshes, and early in 1071 there was a final outbreak of rebel activity in the area. Edwin and Morcar again turned against William, and although Edwin was quickly betrayed and killed, Morcar reached Ely, where he and Hereward were joined by exiled rebels who had sailed from Scotland. William arrived with an army and a fleet to finish off this last pocket of resistance. After some costly failures the Normans managed to construct a pontoon to reach the Isle of Ely, defeated the rebels at the bridgehead and stormed the island, marking the effective end of English resistance. Morcar was imprisoned {{for the rest of his}} life; Hereward was pardoned and had his lands returned to him.|$|E
5|$|In November 1941, Schnaufer {{was posted}} to the II. Gruppe of Nachtjagdgeschwader 1 (II./NJG1—2nd {{group of the}} 1st Night Fighter Wing) at the <b>time</b> <b>based</b> at Stade near Hamburg. Here, Schnaufer was {{assigned}} to the 5. Staffel (5./NJG1—5th squadron of 1st Night Fighter Wing). The Bf 110's of II./NJG1 at the time were not equipped with airborne radar such as the Lichtenstein radar. Night fighter intercept tactics had matured since their early beginnings in July 1940, and II. Gruppe had already been credited with 397 victories. Missions against enemy bombers at the time were usually flown by means of ground-controlled interception, although the Luftwaffe was already experimenting with airborne radar. This air defence system, consisting of a series of radar stations with overlapping coverage, layered three deep, was conceived by Generalleutnant (lit. Lieutenant General; equivalent to Major General) Josef Kammhuber and was organised in the so-called Kammhuber Line. Conceptually, the system was based on a combination of ground-based radar stations, search lights and a Jägerleitoffizier (fighter pilot control officer). The Jägerleitoffizier had to vector the airborne night fighter by means of radio communication to a point of visual interception of the illuminated bomber. These interception tactics were referred to as the Himmelbett (canopy bed) procedure.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Navy {{examined}} {{the ship in}} great detail after she arrived in Libau. The cruiser was then renamed Admiral Makarov and assigned to the 8th Fleet, based in Tallinn. In late 1948, she became the flagship of the 8th Fleet, {{under the command of}} Vice Admiral F. V. Zozulya. In the early 1950s, three new s entered service, which prompted the Soviet Navy to withdraw Admiral Makarov from front line duties. She returned to her old job as a training cruiser, this <b>time</b> <b>based</b> in Kronstadt in mid-1954. During this period, most of her light anti-aircraft armament was removed, and new radars were installed. Her ultimate fate is unclear; she appears to have been placed out of service by May 1959, and was scrapped some time thereafter, reportedly by mid-1960. Nevertheless, she was the longest-surviving major warship of the Kriegsmarine, and the only one to see active service {{after the end of the}} war.|$|E
