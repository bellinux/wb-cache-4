5|$|Turner Catledge, the top {{editor at}} The New York Times from 1952 to 1968, wanted {{to hide the}} {{ownership}} influence. Arthur Sulzberger routinely wrote memos to his editor, each containing suggestions, instructions, complaints, and orders. When Catledge would receive these memos he would erase the publisher's identity before passing them to his subordinates. Catledge thought that if he removed the publisher's name from <b>the</b> <b>memos</b> it would protect reporters from feeling pressured by the owner.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Russian {{president}} Boris Yeltsin disclosed five top-secret memos {{dating from}} {{a few weeks after}} the downing of KAL007 in 1983. <b>The</b> <b>memos</b> contained Soviet communications (from KGB Chief Viktor Chebrikov and Defense Minister Dmitriy Ustinov to General Secretary Yury Andropov) that indicated that they knew the location of KAL007's wreckage while they were simulating a search and harassing the American Navy; they had found the sought-after cockpit voice recorder on October 20, 1983 (50 days after the incident), and had decided to keep this knowledge secret, the reason being that the tapes could not unequivocally support their firmly held view that KAL007's flight to Soviet territory was a deliberately planned intelligence mission.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the panel}} report being completed, Rather {{announced}} the date of his retirement, left 60 Minutes Wednesday, stepped down as anchor on March 9, 2006, and then left CBS altogether on June 20, 2006. The CBS news show that had aired <b>the</b> <b>memos,</b> 60 Minutes Wednesday, was canceled on May 18, 2005, allegedly due to poor ratings and not because of <b>the</b> <b>memos</b> broadcast.|$|E
5000|$|Baron & Budd has {{admitted}} that <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> {{was produced by}} its employees, but denies that <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> instructs its clients to lie and has argued that statements from <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> have {{been taken out of}} context by the press. [...] The firm retained a University of Texas Law School professor, Charles Silver, who wrote an opinion that the firm should not face criminal liability for using <b>the</b> <b>memo,</b> based partly on the affidavit of paralegal Lynnell Terrell who said that she was solely responsible for the authorship of <b>the</b> comprehensive <b>memo</b> and that <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> was rarely used.|$|R
5000|$|In 2013, the FBI {{issued a}} press release {{concerning}} <b>the</b> <b>memo.</b> In addressing <b>the</b> <b>memo's</b> context and possible connection to a hoax, the Bureau wrote, [...] "Finally, <b>the</b> Hottel <b>memo</b> does not prove the existence of UFOs; {{it is simply a}} second- or third-hand claim that we never investigated. Some people believe <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> repeats a hoax that was circulating at that time, but the Bureau’s files have no information to verify that theory." ...|$|R
2500|$|Some later {{critics of}} the Committee's work saw little reason to make much of <b>the</b> <b>memo.</b> Committee member David Saunders wrote that [...] "to present Low as a plotter or {{conspirator}} is unfair and hardly accurate." [...] Project investigator Roy Craig's later wrote that <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> did not trouble him because Condon had not known of <b>the</b> Low <b>memo</b> for eighteen months {{and it did not}} reflect his views. Condon wrote in the Project's Final Report that <b>the</b> <b>memo's</b> description of <b>the</b> Project as emphasizing the [...] "psychology and sociology" [...] of those who report UFO sightings showed how completely Low misunderstood the Project when he wrote <b>the</b> <b>memo.</b>|$|R
25|$|In October 2008, 91 {{pages of}} memos drafted in 2002 by {{officers}} at the Naval Consolidated Brig, Charleston were made public. <b>The</b> <b>memos</b> indicate that officers were concerned that the isolation of solitary confinement and lack of stimuli were causing the prisoner Yasser Hamdi mental anguish and threatened his sanity. <b>The</b> <b>memos</b> also state that Padilla and a third prisoner, Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri, were held in similar conditions at the Brig.|$|E
25|$|No {{generally}} recognized document experts have positively authenticated <b>the</b> <b>memos.</b> Since CBS used only faxed and photocopied duplicates, authentication to professional standards is impossible, {{regardless of the}} provenance of the originals.|$|E
25|$|After Miers {{failed in}} these private meetings, Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and Sam Brownback began {{drafting}} a letter asking the President's office {{to turn over}} legal memoranda and briefs Miers had written for Bush, in order to elucidate her views on political matters. Brownback and Graham knew <b>the</b> <b>memos</b> were protected by executive privilege, that the White House was not required to turn them over, and that Miers could refuse to deliver <b>the</b> <b>memos</b> and then ostensibly step down on principle. Miers would later use this request {{as part of a}} face-saving exit strategy for stepping down. In her letter withdrawing her nomination, she pointed to the senators' request for confidential documents as potentially damaging the executive branch's independence.|$|E
5000|$|No {{member of}} Baron & Budd [...] "has {{been convicted of}} wrongdoing, disciplined, or sanctioned" [...] {{for the use of}} <b>the</b> <b>memo.</b> [...] But no one ever deposed the {{paralegal}} who wrote <b>the</b> <b>memo,</b> her immediate supervisors, or the clients who supposedly were prepared with <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> to testify. Baron does not take the position that these court decisions in his favor [...] "absolutely vindicate that <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> was proper," [...] but he does insist that [...] "the document cannot be evaluated properly without ‘context,’ and points to Lynnell Terrell’s sworn statement that she always orally instructed clients to tell the truth and that she never gave <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> to clients without also handing them a copy of a second article that admonished them to testify truthfully." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked whether}} he {{received}} <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> in May, Admiral Mullen {{said he had no}} knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> but later changed his statement, saying he knew of <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> but [...] "thought nothing of it." [...] Pentagon spokesman Captain John Kirby stated in a press briefing that Mullen [...] "does not know" [...] and had [...] "never communicated with Mr Ijaz".|$|R
50|$|After the {{existence}} of <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> was reported by ABC News and The Washington Post, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist denounced <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> and asserted that the Republican Party's interest in the case was solely based on moral grounds. Darling remained silent about his authorship of <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> as commentators from the conservative magazine Weekly Standard and other publications questioned its authenticity. The source of <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> had not been disclosed by either ABC News or the Washington Post. The Washington Post says that it neither implied that <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> originated from a Republican source nor that it was circulated by Republicans, though it did in fact make these assertions when it published the story by reporters Mike Allen and Manuel Roig-Franzia on its wire service on March 19, 2005. The authorship claim was removed before publication of the print version on March 20, 2005. On April 6, 2005, Darling admitted to writing <b>the</b> <b>memo,</b> and resigned his position as legal counsel to Senator Martinez.|$|R
25|$|Mapes and {{her colleagues}} began {{interviewing}} {{people who might be}} able to corroborate the information in the documents, while also retaining four forensic document experts, Marcel J. Matley, James J. Pierce, Emily Will, and Linda James, to determine the validity of <b>the</b> <b>memos.</b>|$|E
25|$|An April poll by Rasmussen Reports {{found that}} 77 {{percent of voters}} had {{followed}} {{the story in the}} media and that 58 percent believe that releasing <b>the</b> <b>memos</b> compromised American national security. On the issue of a further investigation, 58 percent disagreed while 28% agreed.|$|E
25|$|A {{portion of}} the emails on Clinton's private server were emails sent in 2011 and 2012 by Sidney Blumenthal, a {{political}} supporter and campaign staffer {{who worked for the}} Clinton Foundation. Blumenthal prepared, from public and other sources, about 25 memos which he sent to Clinton during 2011 and 2012 which she shared through her aide, Jake Sullivan, with senior State Department personnel. In the form of intelligence briefings, <b>the</b> <b>memos</b> sometimes touted his business associates and, at times contained inaccurate information.|$|E
5000|$|Academics {{disagree}} as to {{the ethical}} implications of <b>the</b> <b>memo.</b> Lester Brickman has called <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> [...] "subornation of perjury." [...] Others {{argue that it is}} merely [...] "zealous representation." ...|$|R
5000|$|Section two of <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> {{describes}} <b>the</b> {{process of}} determining if individuals have party affiliations. <b>The</b> <b>memo</b> provides for investigators {{to be placed}} within government ministries to conduct investigations into individuals using: ...|$|R
50|$|Senator Martinez, {{who claimed}} {{not to have}} read <b>the</b> <b>memo,</b> had {{inadvertently}} passed it to Iowa Senator Tom Harkin, a Democratic supporter of the legislation to keep Schiavo alive. National media outlets began reporting the existence of <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> shortly thereafter on March 18, 2005. On April 6, 2005, Darling admitted to writing <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> and resigned his position as legal counsel to Martinez.|$|R
25|$|Secretary Rumsfeld {{assured the}} world that the detainees held at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base were going to be treated in a manner {{consistent}} with the treatment of Geneva Convention POWs. In 2004, confidential memos surfaced that discussed the limits to how much pain, discomfort and fear could be used in the interrogation of detainees in the global war on terror. <b>The</b> <b>memos</b> showed that debate within the Bush administration had been resolved in favor of what was later legally determined to be torture.|$|E
25|$|Johnson, {{and other}} bloggers, gained {{attention}} during the 2004 U.S. presidential election for {{their role in}} questioning the authenticity of several memos purporting to document irregularities in George W. Bush's National Guard service record. (See Killian documents and Killian documents authenticity issues.) CBS news anchor Dan Rather presented <b>the</b> <b>memos</b> as authentic in a September 8, 2004 report on 60 Minutes Wednesday, {{two months before the}} vote. Days after the broadcast, Johnson alleged the documents, supposedly typewritten in 1973, could have been created easily on a modern computer using Microsoft Word.|$|E
25|$|Journalists {{including}} Jane Mayer, Joby Warrick and Peter Finn, and Alex Koppelman {{have reported}} the CIA was already using these harsh tactics before the memo authorizing their use was written, {{and that it}} was used to provide after-the-fact legal support for harsh interrogation techniques. A Department of Justice 2009 report regarding prisoner abuses reportedly stated <b>the</b> <b>memos</b> were prepared one month after Abu Zubaydah had already been subjected to the specific techniques authorized in the August 1, 2002, memo. John Kiriakou stated in July 2009 that Abu Zubaydah was waterboarded in the early summer of 2002, months before the August 1, 2002 memo was written.|$|E
50|$|A memo (.DBT) file {{consists}} of blocks numbered sequentially (0,1,2, and so on). SET BLOCKSIZE determines {{the size of}} each block. The first block in <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> file, block 0, is <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> file header.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>memo</b> was dated July 2017 and {{originally}} shared on {{an internal}} mailing list. It was later updated {{to begin with}} a paragraph affirming the author's opposition to workplace sexism and the use of stereotypes. On August 5, <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> was published by Gizmodo, initially with charts and hyperlinks removed from the citations backing up its argumentation. <b>The</b> <b>memo's</b> publication resulted in a controversy across social media, and public criticism of <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> and its author from several Google employees. According to Wired, Google's internal forums showed [...] "plenty of support" [...] for Damore, who said he received private thanks from employees who were afraid to come forward.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>memo</b> was {{denounced by}} the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, {{including}} Slobodan Milošević, the future president of Serbia, who publicly called <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> [...] "nothing else but the darkest nationalism", and Radovan Karadžić, the future leader of Serbs in Bosnia, who stated [...] "Bolshevism is bad, but nationalism is even worse". Despite these declarations, Milošević, Karadžić, and other Serb politicians publicly agreed {{with most of}} <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> and would form close political connections with the writers of <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> such as Mihailo Marković, who became the vice-president of the Socialist Party of Serbia and Dobrica Ćosić who was appointed president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1992.|$|R
25|$|There was {{no getting}} away from Selznick completely, though. He contended that his 50% stake in the profits still {{entitled}} him to input into the project. He still dictated sheaves of memos about the script, and tried to oust Cary Grant from the cast in favor of his contractee, Joseph Cotten. When the United States detonated two atomic bombs over Japan in August, <b>the</b> <b>memos</b> commenced anew and centered mainly on Selznick's continuing dissatisfaction with the script. Hitchcock was abroad, so Dozier called on playwright Clifford Odets, who previously wrote None But the Lonely Heart for RKO and Grant, to do a rewrite. With Hitchcock and Selznick both busy, Barbara Keon would be his only contact.|$|E
25|$|On September 8, 2004, Rather {{reported}} on 60 Minutes Wednesday that {{a series of}} memos critical of President George W. Bush's Texas Air National Guard service record had been discovered in the personal files of Lt. Bush's former commanding officer, Lt. Col. Jerry B. Killian. Once copies of the documents were made available on the Internet, their authenticity was quickly called into question. Much of this {{was based on the}} fact that the documents were proportionally printed and displayed using other modern typographic conventions usually unavailable on military typewriters of the 1970s. The font used on the documents has characteristics that exactly match standard font features of Microsoft Word. This led to claims that <b>the</b> <b>memos</b> were forgeries. The accusations then spread over the following days into mainstream media outlets including The Washington Post, The New York Times, and the Chicago Sun-Times.|$|E
2500|$|In Rather's {{narration}} {{about one}} of <b>the</b> <b>memos,</b> he referred to pressure being applied on Bush's behalf by General Buck Staudt, and described Staudt as [...] "the {{man in charge of}} the Texas National Guard." [...] Staudt had retired from the guard {{a year and a half}} prior to the dates of <b>the</b> <b>memos.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In April 2014, the Clinton Presidential Center {{published}} <b>the</b> original 1995 <b>memo</b> on <b>the</b> conspiracy. <b>The</b> <b>memo's</b> author, Chris Lehane, wrote, [...] "As for {{the premise}} of <b>the</b> <b>memo,</b> I absolutely stand by it. Not only was it right about the right wing then, it is more accurate than ever today." ...|$|R
5000|$|Each {{memo field}} of each {{record in the}} [...]DBF file {{contains}} {{the number of the}} block (in ASCII) where <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> field begins. If <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> field contains no data, the [...]DBF file contains blanks (0x20) rather than a number.|$|R
50|$|In 2007 El Fassed was {{involved}} in a scandal involving a letter allegedly written by Nelson Mandela to New York Times journalist Thomas Friedman. The letter made comparison between South African apartheid to Israel's treatment of Palestinians. <b>The</b> <b>memo</b> was widely cited even by President Jimmy Carter. In 2007, political writer Joel Pollack revealed that <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> was drafted by El Fassed who eventually wrote his own blog post professing that <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> was in fact his own creation.|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} document examiners, however, {{continued to}} be part of the story. By September 15, Emily Will was publicly stating that she had told CBS that she had doubts about both the production of <b>the</b> <b>memos</b> and the handwriting prior to the segment. Linda James stated that <b>the</b> <b>memos</b> were of [...] "very poor quality" [...] and that she did not authenticate them, telling ABC News, [...] "I did not authenticate anything and I don't want it understood that I did." ...|$|E
2500|$|Emily Will noted {{discrepancies}} in the signatures on <b>the</b> <b>memos,</b> and had {{questions about the}} letterhead, the proportional spacing of the font, the superscripted [...] "th" [...] and the improper formatting of the date. Will requested other documents to use for comparison.|$|E
2500|$|Andrew Roberts of The Daily Telegraph stated, [...] "The {{publication}} of the Prince of Wales' private letters has backfired on {{those who seek to}} belittle him, and revealed the idiocy of the human rights industry." [...] He then suggests <b>the</b> <b>memos</b> exposes the Prince’s [...] "passion and dignity".|$|E
5000|$|Admiral Mike Mullen's former spokesman, captain John Kirby, {{acknowledged}} {{the existence of}} <b>the</b> <b>memo,</b> but clarified that [...] "neither the contents of <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> nor <b>the</b> proof of its existence altered or affected in any way {{the manner in which}} Admiral Mullen conducted himself in his relationship with General Kayani and the Pakistani government. He took no note of it". Later, Kirby also stated that Admiral Mullen was confident <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> did not originate from President Zardari.|$|R
5000|$|Power Line {{speculated that}} <b>the</b> Schiavo <b>memo</b> {{was most likely}} forged by Democrats as a {{political}} dirty trick. When <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> {{turned out to be}} written by a Republican aide, Brian Darling, Power Line acknowledged the revelation, but continued to criticize the mainstream media for depicting <b>the</b> <b>memo</b> as [...] "a product of the party's leadership or had an official status." ...|$|R
2500|$|Atwater {{initially}} defended <b>the</b> <b>memo,</b> {{calling it}} [...] "no big deal" [...] and [...] "factually accurate". However, some days later, {{he claimed that}} he had not approved <b>the</b> <b>memo.</b> Under pressure from Bush, Atwater fired Goodin, replacing him with B. Jay Cooper.|$|R
