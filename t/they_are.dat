Their population status or structure, physiology, behaviour or the level of contamination with elements or compounds can indicate the state of contamination status of the ecosystem. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> particularly useful since <b>they</b> <b>are</b> sessile so that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> representative of the environment where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> sampled or placed. Potamopyrgus antipodarum is used by some water treatment plants to test for estrogen-mimicking pollutants from industrial agriculture.|$|E

5|$|Grammar is {{the study}} of how {{meaningful}} elements called morphemes within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be free or bound. If <b>they</b> <b>are</b> free to be moved around within an utterance, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> usually called words, and if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> bound to other words or morphemes, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> called affixes. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words are called morphology. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called syntax.|$|E
