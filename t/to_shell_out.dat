5000|$|Few {{details were}} {{publicly}} known about Wright's pioneering career until {{he wrote a}} few vignettes about that period on his web site for [...] "The Diamond Appraised Baseball Column" [...] that he wrote for three years. They currently remain available in the biography section on Wright {{in relation to the}} radio show A Page from Baseball's Past. Of particular interest is the very different take he has on those early days of sabermetrics in major league baseball that is quite at odds with the theme in Michael Lewis's Moneyball. Lewis portrayed the early practitioners within the game as simply being ignored. Wright acknowledges that very few teams back then were adding such a perspective, and that the general usage was at times on a small scale, but he makes a strong case that there were pockets where it was not only valued but had real impact. He gives interesting examples from his career and he scores a key point with his question: [...] "All my contracts were 1-year contracts. Do you really think teams are going <b>to</b> keep <b>shelling</b> <b>out</b> the money year after year just to have you give advice that they will ignore?" ...|$|R

40|$|To {{provide an}} {{overview}} of the anatomical landmarks needed to guide a retropubic (Retzius) -sparing robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP), and a step-by-step description of the surgical technique that maximizes preservation of the periprostatic neural network. The anatomy of the pelvic fossae is presented, including the recto-vesical pouch (pouch of Douglas) created by the reflections of the peritoneum. The actual technique of the trans-Douglas, intrafascial nerve-sparing robotic radical prostatectomy is described. The technique allows the prostate gland <b>to</b> be <b>shelled</b> <b>out</b> from under the overlying detrusor apron and dorsal vascular complex (DVC-Santorini plexus), entirely avoiding the pubovesical ligaments. There is no need to control the DVC, since the line of dissection passes beneath the plexus. Three key points to ensure enhanced nerve preservation should be respected: (1) the tips of the seminal vesicles, enclosed in a "cage" of neuronal tissue; a seminal vesicle-sparing technique is therefore advised when oncologically safe; (2) the external prostate-vesicular angle; (3) the lateral surface of the prostate gland and the apex. The principles of tension and energy-free dissection should guide all the maneuvers in order to minimize neuropathy. Using robotic technology, a complete intrafascial dissection of the prostate gland can be achieved through the Douglas space, reducing surgical trauma and providing excellent functional and oncological outcomes...|$|R
