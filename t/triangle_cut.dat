40|$|Following {{the flurry}} of recent {{theoretical}} work on cutting planes from two-row mixed integer group relaxations of an LP tableau, we report on computational tests to evaluate the strength of two-row cuts based on lattice-free triangles having more than one integer point on one side. A heuristic procedure to generate such triangles (referred to in the literature as “type 2 ” triangles) is presented, and then the coefficients of the integer variables are tightened by lifting. To test the effectiveness of <b>triangle</b> <b>cuts,</b> we compare the gap closed using Gomory mixed integer cuts for one round, the gap closed in one round using all the <b>triangle</b> <b>cuts</b> generated by our heuristic and the gap closed by {{a small number of}} two-row split cuts. Our tests are carried out on randomly generated instances designed to represent different problem features by varying the number of integer non-basic variables, bounds, non-negativity constraints and density, {{as well as on the}} classical MIPLIB instances. The outcome of this computational analysis is some insight into key characteristics of MIP instances whose presence makes two-row <b>triangle</b> <b>cuts</b> computationally effective. In particular it appears to be necessary that the tableau row pairs are dense, and more subjectively that the non-basic continuous variables are “important”. Unfortunately these characteristics seem rarely to be present among real life instances, and more specifically the tableau rows of the MIPLIB instances are far from dense.

Incorporating a raised retro-reflective element, they are typically more visible at night and in inclement weather than standard road marking lines. The color of markers varies depending on the country of use; freeways in the United States often use reflectors manufactured to appear white to drivers proceeding in the proper direction of travel, and appear red on the reverse to warn drivers that they are proceeding against the proper direction of travel, creating a danger of a head-on collision. Reflective markers are {{also referred to as}} raised pavement markers, road studs, and sometimes (generically) in the UK and Ireland as cat's eye, although this name refers to one particular brand of product. These markers can be used for other purposes such as marking the locations of fire hydrants (blue) or at gates of gated communities to indicate that emergency service vehicles have a code or device that allows them to open the gate. In the United Kingdom and elsewhere, raised markers are used to mark crosswalks (crossings) to assist the blind in crossing streets. In colder climates, reflective markers may be installed below ground using an elongated narrow <b>triangle,</b> <b>cut</b> into the road surface that allows the device to be installed below the road surface.

Near the closed end, a small square hole is cut and a thin reed of bronze or copper is fastened, with a low plastic or bone mouthpiece around it. This reed is essentially a very thin sheet of metal with a long and narrow isosceles <b>triangle</b> <b>cut</b> into it, which is bent slightly outwards at rest. When the instrument is blown, this thin triangle moves back and forth rapidly through the space left in the metal sheet from which it was cut, like a swinging door. This vibration sets the air column in the instrument in rapid periodic motion, creating sound. The mouth does not contact the reed. Seven or eight finger-holes are positioned 90 degrees {{out of line with}} the reed, though this is adjustable in the common two-piece instruments provided with a metal tenon.

For a diatonic scale, the lower two notes are in the fundamental mode of the reed, {{and the rest of the}} range is overblown, exciting the vibratory mode of the resonating pipe. The lowest scale degree, and the lowest overblown note are a minor third apart and fingered the same way; this unusually narrow overblowing behavior suggests the instrument has some irregular overtones outside of the standard harmonic series.|$|E

Under a specific probabilistic model of the problem parameters, we show that for the above measure, {{the probability that a}} split cut is better than a type 1 <b>triangle</b> <b>cut</b> is higher than the probability that a type 1 <b>triangle</b> <b>cut</b> is better than a split cut. The analysis also suggests some guidelines on when type 1 triangle cuts {{are likely to be more}} effective than split cuts and vice versa. We next study a minimum concave cost network flow problem over a grid network. We give a polytime algorithm to solve this problem when the number of echelons is fixed. We show that the problem is NP-hard when the number of echelons is an input parameter. We also extend our result to grid networks with backward and upward arcs. Our result unifies the complexity results for several models in production planning and green recycling including the lot-sizing model, and gives the first polytime algorithm for some problems whose complexities were not known before. Finally, we examine how much complexity randomness will bring to a simple combinatorial optimization problem. We study a problem called the sell or hold problem (SHP). SHP is to sell k out of n indivisible assets over two stages, with known first-stage prices and random second-stage prices, to maximize the total expected revenue. Although the deterministic version of SHP is trivial to solve, we show that SHP is NP-hard when the second-stage prices are realized as a finite set of scenarios.

The set of faces of such a partition is a maximal set of disjoint <b>triangles</b> that <b>cut</b> S at, and only at, their vertices. Surprisingly, several properties of point set triangulations extend to elementary partitions. Thus, the number of their faces is an invariant of S. In the same way, if S is in general position, there exists a unique elementary partition of S whose faces are inscribable in circles whose interiors do not intersect S. This partition, called elementary Delaunay partition, is dual to the segment Voronoi diagram. The main result {{of this paper is}} that the local optimality which characterizes point set Delaunay triangulations [8] extends to elementary Delaunay partitions. A similar result holds for elementary partitions with same topology as the Delaunay one. ...|$|R

40|$|Cutting planes for a mixed-integer {{program are}} linear inequalities which are {{satisfied}} by all feasible solutions of the latter. These are fundamental objects in mixed-integer programming {{that are critical}} for solving large-scale problems in practice. One of the main challenge in employing them {{is that there are}} limitless possibilities for generating cutting planes; the selection of the strongest ones is crucial for their effective use. In this thesis, we provide a principled study of the strength of generalpurpose cutting planes, giving {{a better understanding of the}} relationship between the different families of cuts available and analyzing the properties and limitations of our current methods for deriving cuts. We start by analyzing the strength of disjunctive cuts that generalize the ubiquitous split cuts. We first provide a complete picture of the containment relationship of the split closure, second split closure, cross closure, crooked cross closure and tbranch split closure. In particular, we show that rank- 2 split cuts and crooked cross cuts are neither implied by cross cuts, which points out the limitations of the latter; these results answer questions left open in [56, 65]. Moreover, given the prominent role of relaxations and their computational advantages, we explore how strong are cross cuts obtained from basic and 2 -row relaxations. Unfortunately we show that not all cross cuts can be obtained as cuts based on these relaxation, answering a question left open in [56]. One positive message from this result, though, is that cross cuts do not suffer from the limitations of these relaxations. Our second contribution is the introduction of a probabilistic model for comparing the strength of families of cuts for the continuous relaxation. We employ this model to compare the important split and <b>triangle</b> <b>cuts,</b> obtaining results that provide improved information about their behavior. More precisely, while previous works indicated that <b>triangle</b> <b>cuts</b> should be much stronger than split cuts, we provide the first theoretical support for the effect that is observed in practice: for most instances, these cuts have the same strength. In our third contribution, we study the multi-dimensional infinite relaxation introduced by Gomory and Johnson in the late 60 ’s, which has been an important tool for analyzing and obtaining insights on cutting planes. The celebrated Gomory- Johnson’s 2 -Slope Theorem gives a sufficient condition for a cut to be facet defining from the 1 -row infinite relaxation. We provide an extension of this result for the k-row case, for arbitrary k, which we call the (k + 1) -Slope Theorem. Despite increasing interest in understanding the multi-row case, no such extension was known prior to our work. This result, together with the relevance of 2 -slope functions for the 1 -dimensional case, indicates that (k + 1) -slope functions might lead to strong cuts in practice. In our fourth contribution, we consider cuts that generalize Gomory fractional cuts but take into account upper bounds imposed on the variables. More specifically, we revisit the lopsided cuts obtained recently by Balas and Qualizza via a disjunctive procedure. We give a geometric interpretation of these cuts, viewing them as cuts for the infinite relaxation that are strengthened by a geometric lifting procedure. Using this perspective, we are able to generalize these cuts to obtain a family of cuts which has on one end the GMI cut, and on the other end the lopsided cuts. We show that all these cuts are “new”, namely they are all facets of the infinite relaxation with upper bounded basic variable. We conclude by presenting preliminary experimental results, which unfortunately shows that these cuts decrease in importance as they move away from the GMI inequality, complementing the experimental results from Balas and Qualizza. In our final contribution, we further explore properties and characterizations of split cuts, focusing on a general model of mixed-integer corner relaxation. The backbone of this work is a description of the split cuts for this relaxation from the perspective of cut-generating functions; this essentially establishes the equivalence of split cuts and (a generalization of) the k-cuts [50]. As our previous result, this characterization is obtained using the geometric lifting idea, illustrating its flexibility as a tool for analyzing cuts. As a consequence, we show that every split cut for a corner relaxation is the restriction of a split cut for the mixed-integer infinite relaxation, which further indicates the universality of the latter. As another consequence, we construct a pure-integer set with arbitrarily weak split closure, giving a pure-integer counterpart of the mixed-integer construction from [27]...|$|R

Further, we show that split cuts for finite-dimensional corner relaxations are restrictions of split cuts for the infinite-dimensional relaxation. In a final application of this equivalence, we exhibit a family of pure-integer programs whose split closures have arbitrarily bad integrality gap.

The sides of all the triangles were three inches in length, with the bases of 120 one inch, and of the other 183 half an inch in length. These latter triangles were very narrow or much acuminated. {32} As {{a check on the}} observations presently to be given, similar triangles in a damp state were seized by a very narrow pair of pincers at different points and at all inclinations with reference to the margins, and were then drawn into a short tube of the diameter of a worm-burrow. If seized by the apex, the triangle was drawn straight into the tube, with its margins infolded; if seized at some little distance from the apex, for instance at half an inch, this much was doubled back within the tube. So it was with the base and basal angles, though in this case the triangles offered, as might have been expected, much more resistance to being drawn in. If seized near the middle the triangle was doubled up, with the apex and base left sticking out of the tube. As the sides of the triangles were three inches in length, the result of their being drawn into a tube or into a burrow in different ways, may be conveniently divided into three groups: those drawn in by the apex or within an inch of it; those drawn in by the base or within an inch of it; and those drawn in by any point in the middle inch.|$|R
