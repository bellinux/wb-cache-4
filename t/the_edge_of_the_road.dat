The grit is sometimes mixed with molasses to help adhesion to the road surface. However, the sweet molasses often attracts livestock, who lick the road.|$|E

One evening the maniac escapes from her nurse and sets fire to the room in which Lord Rochester has fallen asleep. He is saved from a horrible death by Jane.

2500|$|According to Butterworth, {{the first}} {{documentary}} reference to [...] "Milburn" [...] dates from 1200/1 when King John (1199–1215) granted {{the forest of}} Milburn to William de Stuteville, Lord of the Barony of Cottingham near Hull. The term [...] "forest" [...] in this context refers to an area suitable for hunting rather than forestry in its modern sense. [...] Of course, this in no sense implies that the modern village dates from this period, nor that there was necessarily a [...] "Burn" [...] and a [...] "Mill" [...] here. Goodchild argues that the name is actually derived from Mil Borran, meaning a stone by a Roman road. Curiously on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> {{at the entrance to}} the lonning leading to the church at NY65360/29165 there is an ancient stone which is registered on the Sites and Monuments Record (SMR) as a cross base.

2500|$|Primarily, the Miller Highway {{consisted}} of six lanes, supported above the street level on steel columns, which were located {{at regular intervals}} (~80 feet) at the outer edges and center of the roadway. [...] Longitudinal strength girders ran between the support columns along {{the direction of the}} roadway. [...] The longitudinal girders supported the industrial looking balustrades and the median. [...] Lateral strength girders ran between the support columns across the roadway, and was the location of the expansion joints. [...] Smaller longitudinal and transverse floorbeams formed a lattice structure between major girders to support the road deck. [...] The road deck {{consisted of}} reinforced concrete, on top of which the paved surface would sit. [...] Originally this was Belgian block, and was eventually substituted or paved over with asphalt as construction materials matured. [...] Drainage was provided at the expansion joints (on the older sections) or grated channels along <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> (newest sections), with rainwater and snowmelt being plumbed to the street through scuppers and downspouts located at the main support columns. [...] It was not uncommon during the life of the highway that it would be supporting not only traffic, but 6 to 8 inches of standing water. [...] The high impermeable balustrades, the undersized scuppers, and the lack of drain cleaning / maintenance were all ingredients which contributed to the structure's demise.|$|E
