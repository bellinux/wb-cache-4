6000|$|... "You {{tell the}} story much better <b>than</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> does," [...] said Edward, nodding. [...] "From the way he tells it one might think that you had the island in the boat with you." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{will not}} {{hesitate}} to state that I was nearly stunned by Mr. Aaron Woodward's unexpected statement. I knew that when he announced that I was a worse villain <b>than</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> he meant a good deal.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is easily}} asserted, Violet; but it would, I think, be better {{that you should}} take <b>my</b> part <b>than</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's,</b> if it be that you intend to be my wife." ...|$|R
500|$|Thorgerd {{replied in}} a loud voice, 'I have had no evening meal, nor will I do so until I join Freyja. I know no better course of action <b>than</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's.</b> I {{do not want to}} live after <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and brother are dead.' ...|$|R
25|$|Whereas <b>my</b> <b>father</b> laid {{upon you}} a heavy yoke, so shall I add tenfold thereto. Whereas <b>my</b> <b>father</b> chastised (tortured) you with whips, so shall I chastise you with scorpions. For my littlest finger is thicker <b>than</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> loins; and your backs, which bent like reeds at <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> touch, shall break like straws {{at my own}} touch.|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{father never}} {{in his life}} said {{anything}} to me about his own money affairs, though he says {{a great deal about}} mine. No man ever was closer <b>than</b> <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> But I believe that he could afford almost anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is gone," [...] said poor Scowl; [...] "that bewitched beast {{with the}} split horn has killed him. He is gone {{who was the}} best white man in all South Africa, whom I loved better <b>than</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and all my relatives." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Aweel, it was {{my father}} laid it down,’ said she. ‘There were few knew more about port wine <b>than</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> God rest him!’ She settled herself in a chair with an {{alarming}} air of resolution. ‘And so there is some particular direction that you wish to go in?’ said she.|$|E
5000|$|In Egils saga, when Egill Skallagrímsson {{refuses to}} eat, his {{daughter}} Þorgerðr (here anglicized as [...] "Thorgerd") {{says she will}} go without food and thus starve to death, {{and in doing so}} will meet the goddess Freyja::Thorgerd replied in a loud voice, [...] "I have had no evening meal, nor will I do so until I join Freyja. I know no better course of action <b>than</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's.</b> I do not want to live after <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and brother are dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I could wish, my lord," [...] said Ravenswood, {{agitated}} by suppressed emotion, [...] "that {{reference to}} these circumstances {{should be made}} anywhere rather <b>than</b> under <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> roof." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{does he mean}} then {{by saying}} that he would rather not have Colonel Osborne here? A man older <b>than</b> <b>my</b> own <b>father,</b> who has known me since I was a baby!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Nettie laughed. “The shell fits {{you very}} close. Still, {{you told me}} you had made a second friend, and that implies a good deal, I think. That is why I am going to ask you a question. What brought you out from the old country? I want to know more <b>than</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> does.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't trouble yourself," [...] {{said the}} invalid, [...] "there is no mistake. I know {{more of your}} affairs <b>than</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> and I can manage them better.--Leave the room, Tom." [...] The servant obeyed.--"We must not," [...] said the invalid, [...] "lose time, when we have little to lose. Open the {{shutters}} of that window." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's {{what she}} thinks,' pursued Clarence, 'and that I {{want to be}} a grander man <b>than</b> <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> That's at the bottom of her mind, I see. Well, if you deplore this, and let her think the place can't do without me, she will come out in her {{strength}} and make it my duty to stay at home.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A bargain is a bargain," [...] she said. [...] "You {{came to me}} first, and but for you I {{should never}} have earned a penny. Now we have moved into a better street and have {{comfortable}} lodgings. We have everything we want, and I am laying by money fast. You have always treated me well, and I like you though your temper is even worse <b>than</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's.</b> I shall keep to my agreement {{as long as you}} keep to yours, and if you do not I shall not come here at all." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{an instant}} I {{was covered with}} {{confusion}} and remorse. The man to whose company I had objected was none other <b>than</b> <b>my</b> own <b>father,</b> and as he approached I {{could see that he}} was wounded in the right leg.|$|R
6000|$|... "Speak not for them, Rose," [...] replied Eveline, angrily; [...] "no {{innocent}} {{victim was}} ever offered {{up at the}} altar of a fiend with more indifference <b>than</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> kinswoman delivered up me--me, an orphan, bereaved of my natural and powerful support. I hate her cruelty--I hate her house--I hate the thought of all that has happened here--of all, Rose, except thy matchless faith and fearless attachment. Go, bid our train saddle directly--I will be gone instantly--I will not attire myself" [...] she added, rejecting the assistance she had at first required--"I will have no ceremony-- tarry for no leave-taking." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Awell, it was {{my father}} laid it down," [...] said she. [...] "There were few knew more about port wine <b>than</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> God rest him!" [...] She settled herself in a chair with an {{alarming}} air of resolution. [...] "And so there is some particular direction that you wish to go in?" [...] said she.|$|E
60|$|Here I {{was left}} {{seated on the}} ground {{under the care of}} {{one of the men who}} had {{captured}} me, until a full hour passed, and then to my great relief of mind and wondrous joy, none other <b>than</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> came up, welcoming me with all the love which I knew full well he had in his heart.|$|E
60|$|I had two elder brothers, one {{of which}} was {{lieutenant-colonel}} to an English regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous Colonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk against the Spaniards. What became of my second brother I never knew, any more <b>than</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> or mother did know what was become of me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely, signor; one, {{no longer}} ago <b>than</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> time," [...] said the guide; and he added, {{with the air}} of a man who {{believed}} what he was telling, [...] "but the first that went astray here was a pagan of old Rome, who hid himself in order to spy out and betray the blessed saints, who then dwelt and worshipped in these dismal places. You have heard the story, signor? A miracle was wrought upon the accursed one; and, ever since (for fifteen centuries at least), he has been groping in the darkness, seeking {{his way out of the}} catacomb." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{greatest}} comfort {{we have is}} {{that none}} of you believe it; and your <b>father</b> knew <b>my</b> <b>father</b> better <b>than</b> any one else. I was afraid I didn't make Louise understand how much I felt that, and how much Adeline did. It was hard to tell her, without seeming to thank you for something that was no more <b>than</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> due. But we do feel it, both of us; and I would like your father to know it. I don't blame him for what he is going to do. It's necessary to establish <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> innocence to have the trial. I was very unjust to your father that first day, when I thought he believed those things against papa. We appreciate his kindness in every way, but we shall not get any lawyer to defend us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am guiltless in that matter," [...] {{answered}} Glendinning, [...] "nor have {{presumed to}} think otherwise <b>than</b> thou, <b>my</b> kind <b>father,</b> hast taught me, and than the Church allows." ...|$|R
60|$|My goodness! didn't he screech, {{much worse}} <b>than</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> when {{his legs were}} broken. And didn't {{everybody}} else roar and shout, and didn't I dance? Off I went right over the fat boy, who had tumbled down, {{up to the end}} of the field, then so bewildered was I with shock and the burning pain, back again quite close to them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am no king's man," [...] {{replied the}} boy quietly, [...] "I am Norman of Torn, who has neither a king nor a god, and who says 'by your leave' to no man. But I {{have come in}} peace because I wish to talk to another <b>than</b> <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> Therefore you may talk to me, priest," [...] he {{concluded}} with haughty peremptoriness.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My father! I {{wonder how}} he'd look {{if he got}} a letter from me asking for money. You might as well expect a goose to feed her young with blood out of her own breast, like a pelican, as expect that a Scotch lord should give money to his younger sons like an English duke. What would my father get by my being member for Tillietudlem? No; I must look nearer home <b>than</b> <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> What can you do for me?' ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{never knew}} anyone who got greater joy out of living <b>than</b> did <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> or anyone who more whole-heartedly {{performed}} every duty; {{and no one}} whom I have ever met approached his combination of enjoyment of life and performance of duty. He and my mother were given to hospitality that {{at that time was}} associated more commonly with southern than northern households. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{so little}} to tell. One day is so much like another with me, only I have been rather busier <b>than</b> usual lately. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> has had to cut down expenses. We have no hired man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do as {{you will}} with it, then," [...] replied his hostess, [...] "for there it lies, and shall lie for me. If you are fool enough to pay more <b>than</b> is reason, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> shall not be knave enough to take it." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{dear old}} place--house with five gables {{on the garden}} front, black timbered, and with white plaster between, and oh! such flowers in the garden--was left to my mother for her life; {{and she was a}} great deal younger <b>than</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> so we went on living there, and it was only when I was almost a woman that I came to the {{knowledge}} that the property would never be mine, but would go in the male line to the son of one of my disinherited convict brothers.|$|E
60|$|And {{in the end}} {{it became}} clear that this belief was not ill-founded, for one day three years after the old man's death, there landed at the port of Yarmouth none other <b>than</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> who had been absent some eight years in all. Nor did he come alone, for with him he brought a wife, a young and very lovely lady, who {{afterwards}} was my mother. She was a Spaniard of noble family, having been born at Seville, and her maiden name was Donna Luisa de Garcia.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He that is {{from the}} court,' said he, 'is a person of no less quality and dignity <b>than</b> <b>my</b> <b>Father</b> and I; {{and he is the}} Lord Chief Secretary of my Father's house: for he is, and always has been, the chief {{dictator}} of all my Father's laws, a person altogether well skilled in all mysteries, and knowledge of mysteries, as is my Father, or as myself is. Indeed he is one with us in nature, and also as to loving of, and being faithful to, and in the eternal concerns of the town of Mansoul.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said she, [...] "and I {{am trying}} very hard to be that. A little while ago I had a father with whom I {{expected}} to live and be happy, but that dream is over now. And then I thought I had an uncle {{who was going to be}} more of a <b>father</b> to me <b>than</b> <b>my</b> own <b>father</b> had ever been. But that dream is over, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well. I {{love you}} more <b>than</b> I fear <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> anger, {{and he is}} more terrible in anger than a {{mountain}} storm. You told me what love is. This is the test of love. I shall help you to run away back to the world." ...|$|R

[...] Näsström cites the above passage from Egils saga as an example, and points to a potential additional connection in the saga Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks, where the queen hangs herself in the dísarsalr (Old Norse [...] "the Hall of the Dís") after discovering that her husband has betrayed both her father and brother. Näsström comments that [...] "this Dís could hardly be anyone but Freyja herself, the natural leader of the collective female deities called dísir, and the place of the queen's suicide seems thus to be connected with Freyja." ...|$|R
