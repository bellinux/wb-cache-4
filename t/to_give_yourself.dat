Author and psychologist [...] Vlad Mixich cites Eminescu's full answer as a sample of press insult in late 19th-century Romania: [...] "The things Mr. N. Xenopoulos says are, in my view, the figments of a fomenting imagination, excited by the sting of my putdown. But {{who do you think}} you are to be allowed, at your age and with the knowledge you don't have, <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>yourself</b> such superior airs?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Grandmaster (GM) John Nunn adds a caveat: when {{in a bad}} position, {{one must}} decide between two strategies, which he calls [...] "grim [...] " [...] and [...] "create confusion." [...] "Grim defence" [...] {{involves}} finding some way to hang on, often by liquidating to an ending. [...] "Create confusion" [...] entails trying to [...] "gain the initiative, even at material cost, hoping to stir up complications and cause the opponent to go wrong." [...] Nunn cautions that, [...] "If you decide to go for 'create confusion' then you should press the panic button sufficiently early <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>yourself</b> a reasonable chance of success. However, you should be sure that your position is really bad enough to warrant such drastic measures. In my experience, {{it is far more}} common to panic too early than too late." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scott Miller {{chose to}} name his new band [...] "Game Theory" [...] as {{an allusion to}} the {{mathematical}} field of game theory, which he described as [...] "the study of calculating the most appropriate action given an adversary, ... someone who was thinking against you, {{and you had to}} organize what his moves could be, and what your moves should be, <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>yourself</b> the minimum amount of failure." [...] In a 1988 interview, Miller stated, [...] "It's a theory of probability that's a mathematical discipline that more or less has been applied improperly to real-life situations. It's just that idea of a set of rules that gets misused that intrigued me about it.... kind of a telling comment on life in general—that you just have {{to have some sort of}} set of rules, but who knows what the set of rules should be." [...] That theme, according to Miller, was what many Game Theory songs were about: [...] "Always be wary of the superstructure of whatever situation you're in. It may just be that the whole game that you're into is something very bogus and you should get out." ...|$|E

50|$|Twistaplot {{covers a}} wide variety of genres, {{including}} science fiction, fantasy, and horror. Similar <b>to</b> the <b>Give</b> <b>Yourself</b> Goosebumps series, they are novels with branching plots. The books are written from the second-person perspective, in present-tense form. The protagonist in each book is never referred to by name, and the protagonist's gender is ambiguous. Thus the reader can easily imagine himself/herself as the protagonist of the storyline. But unlike the <b>Give</b> <b>Yourself</b> Goosebumps series, the books have interior illustrations.|$|R

6000|$|... "Come," [...] he said, [...] "so {{far as you}} are concerned, {{you have}} nothing to {{complain}} of. You offered, I believe, <b>to</b> <b>give</b> it up <b>yourself</b> on one condition." ...|$|R

5000|$|There is {{a strong}} {{emphasis}} on personal mobility and opportunity as the basis for aspirations or the 'ideal" [...] future. The author touches on the essential points of using any resources that are possible in order to mobilize yourself on a small scale, and <b>to</b> in time <b>give</b> <b>yourself</b> and opportunity on a larger scale. An example given is of Arthur working at a liquor store {{to get an idea of}} how to set up his own business. The author analyzes the men's lack of social capital in the world of work, and says the men are disadvantaged in the human capital of strategic skills and talents.|$|R
5000|$|In 1988, {{with fellow}} {{psychologist}} Linda Dubrow Eichel, he performed {{research in the}} area of procrastination. During the Persian Gulf war, Eichel said that images from the conflict affected his teenage clients, [...] "Those two things really hit my teenage patients hard." [...] He said that bad dreams about the battles were, [...] "little red lights, saying it's time to step back, think about yourself, think about your life, talk to other people, gather information, connect with people who are important to you. It is a warning sign that you should not go on with life as usual." [...] He commented to The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2000 on the subject of the controversial religious group, the evangelical International Church of Christ; that the methodology behind the group [...] "is that you <b>give</b> <b>yourself</b> over <b>to</b> the person who acts as your 'shepherd' or discipler, and they get tremendous control over you. ... Every minute your life must be Christ-centered, and that when you <b>give</b> <b>yourself</b> over <b>to</b> Jesus, you <b>give</b> <b>yourself</b> over <b>to</b> the ICC." [...] In 2000, Eichel said he had counseled approximately six former members of the group in his psychotherapy practice.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Treffry {{said with}} a sort of laugh: [...] "Near go, eh? You drive? No? That's a pity! Broken most of my bones at the game--nothing like it!" [...] Each felt a kind of admiration for the other that he had not felt before. Presently Mr. Treffry began: [...] "Look here, Mr. Harz, my niece is a slip of a thing, with all a young girl's notions! What have you got <b>to</b> <b>give</b> her, eh? <b>Yourself?</b> That's surely not enough; mind this--six months after {{marriage}} we all turn out much the same--a selfish lot!
