50|$|The {{principles}} of geometric design {{apply to the}} jerk oriented orthogonally to the path of motion, considering the centripetal acceleration, whereas the velocity along the path {{is assumed to be}} constant, and so the tangential jerk is zero. Any change in curvature of the path implies non-zero jerk, arising from purely geometric reasons. To avoid the unbounded (centripetal) jerk when moving from a straight path into a curve or vice versa, track transition curves are constructed, which limit the jerk by gradually increasing the centripetal acceleration, i.e. the curvature, to the value that belongs to the radius of the circle and the speed of travel. The theoretical optimum is achieved by the Euler spiral, which linearly increases the acceleration, i.e., constant jerk. As a design rule a maximum value of 0.5 m/s3 and for convenience purposes a value of 0.35 m/s3 are recommended in railway design. The picture shows a piece of an Euler spiral leading as track transition curve from a straight line to an arc of a circle. In <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>scenario</b> the plane of the track is inclined {{in the course of the}} curve and so also this vertical acceleration of the necessary lifting of the center of mass of the rail car has to be considered to minimize the wear on the embankment and the tracks by following a slightly different curve. This has been patented as the Wiener Kurve (Viennese Curve).|$|E

In this paper is presented a CAD-based system that allows users with basic skills in CAD and without skills in robot programming to generate robot programs from a CAD model of a robotic cell. When the CAD model reproduces exactly <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>scenario,</b> the system presents a satisfactory performance. On the contrary, when the CAD model does not reproduce exactly <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>scenario</b> or the calibration process is poorly done, we are dealing with uncertain (unstructured environment). In order to minimize or eliminate the previously mentioned problems, it was introduced sensory feedback (force and torque sensing) in the robotic framework. By controlling the end-effector pose and specifying its relationship to the interaction/contact forces, robot programmers can ensure that the robot maneuvers in an unstructured environment, damping possible impacts and also increasing the tolerance to positioning errors from the calibration process. Fuzzy-PI reasoning was used as a force control technique. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was evaluated in a series of experiments.
