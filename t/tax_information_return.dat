40|$|For over a century, politicians, {{government}} officials and scholars in the United States have debated whether corporate tax returns, which are currently subject to broad tax privacy protections, should be publicly accessible. The ongoing global discussion of base erosion and profit shifting by multinational corporations has generated calls for greater tax transparency. Throughout this debate, participants have focused exclusively on the potential reactions of a corporation’s managers, shareholders and consumers to a corporation’s disclosure of its own <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> <b>information.</b> There is, however, another perspective: how would {{the ability of a}} corporation’s stakeholders and agents to observe other corporations’ <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> <b>information</b> affect the corporation’s compliance with the tax law? This Article examines the relationship of corporate tax privacy and tax compliance from this new vantage point, which it terms the “intercorporate perspective. ” The primary claim of this Article is that corporate tax privacy may limit the pressure to engage in more aggressive tax planning and reporting that corporate tax directors face from significant shareholders, non-tax managers, and even themselves. Specifically, tax privacy provides the government with valuable strategic defenses by restraining the ability of a corporation’s stakeholders and agents to engage in benchmarking and reverse engineering, behaviors that would likely cause some tax directors to pursue more aggressive tax planning and reporting. Yet increased public access would also enrich public awareness and debate of corporate tax reform issues, which could motivate legislators to act. The result of this analysis, thus, is not a recommendation that all corporate <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> <b>information</b> should receive <b>tax</b> privacy protections. Rather, this Article offers a set of guidelines, including consideration of the strategic defenses of corporate tax privacy, which will better equip policymakers to evaluate specific proposals to make corporate <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> <b>information</b> public...|$|R

This paper, an extension of earlier works examining trends in business organizational structure based on statistics compiled from <b>tax</b> and <b>information</b> <b>returns,</b> attempts to contribute to this discussion [1, 2, 3, 4]. This paper examines business aggregate time series data {{in light of the}} substantial changes to the Internal Revenue Code, which have affected incentives of shifting from one organizational form to another.

40|$|Fairness in the {{administration}} of the tax law is the subject of intense debate in the United States. As recent headlines reveal, the Internal Revenue Service has been accused of failing to enforce the tax law equitably in its review of tax-exempt status applications by political organizations, the international tax structures of multinational corporations, and the estate tax returns of millionaires, among other areas. Many have argued that greater “tax transparency” would better empower the public to hold the IRS accountable and the IRS to defend itself against accusations of malfeasance. Mandatory public disclosure of taxpayers’ <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> <b>information</b> is often proposed as a way to achieve greater tax transparency. Yet, in addition to concerns regarding exposure of personal and proprietary information, broad public disclosure measures pose potential threats to the taxing authority’s ability to enforce the tax law. Given the competing values of accountability and enforcement, what <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> <b>information</b> should be observable by the public? This Article argues that timing matters. The IRS continually engages in enforcement actions ex post, after taxpayers have pursued transactions and claimed tax positions, such as by conducting audits or settlements. But it also frequently engages in actions ex ante, before taxpayers pursue transactions and claim tax positions, by issuing advance tax rulings to and entering into agreements with specific taxpayers. While current law appears to require public disclosure of certain types of ex ante tax administration, many forms of ex ante tax administration remain concealed from public view. This Article argues that documents related to a specific taxpayer’s tax affairs that reflect ex ante tax administration should be publicly accessible as a means of accountability, but that documents that reflect ex post tax actions should remain private in order to preserve effective tax enforcement. Further, this Article proposes that the public should have access not only to ex ante tax administration actions where the taxing authority grants taxpayers’ requests, but also to those actions where the taxing authority denies such requests, even if it does so without issuing an official written determination, a concept it defines as “dual tax transparency. ” The Article then applies this analysis to several types of ex ante tax administration that are currently obscured by the curtain of tax privacy: withdrawn private letter ruling requests, adverse tax-exempt determination letters and advance pricing agreements. It concludes by exploring approaches to improving the accountability of the IRS regarding its ex post tax enforcement other than public disclosure of <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> <b>information...</b>|$|R

The goal to significantly improve economic efficiency, enhance stability in financial markets, and reduce to a minimum the costs of tax administration (assessment, collection,and compliance costs). There is disagreement over whether the tax is progressive, with the debate primarily centered on whether the volume of taxed transactions rise disproportionately with a person's income and net worth. Simulations of the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances [...] demonstrate that high income and wealthy individuals undertake a disproportionate volume of transactions since they own {{a disproportionate share of}} financial assets that have relatively high turnover rates.
