5|$|The {{primary goal}} of the planned University of New England {{extension}} program was to provide opportunities for people to obtain a university degree who could not easily travel to attend lectures, often because they lived in rural areas. At this time, most Australian universities were opposed <b>to</b> <b>external</b> degree programs because, among other reasons, they considered that they diluted academic standards and provided a sub-standard education. Madgwick felt that these potential issues could be overcome by careful administration and appropriate financial support from the government. In setting up the program, Madgwick directed that the program's instructors also participate in internal education and should be considered {{on a par with}} their internal colleagues. The examinations given <b>to</b> <b>external</b> students would be the same as those given to internal attendees. External students were required to attend some residential courses as part of their degree programs.|$|E
5|$|Ethernet {{standards}} require {{electrical isolation}} between the networked device (computer, phone, etc.) {{and the network}} cable up to 1500VAC or 2250VDC for 60seconds.

This gives Ethernet a significant safety advantage over USB with peripherals such as cable and DSL modems connected <b>to</b> <b>external</b> wiring that can assume hazardous voltages under certain fault conditions.|$|E

A device connected by eSATA appears as an ordinary SATA device, giving both full performance and full compatibility associated with internal drives.|$|E
5|$|The {{migration}} of many birds in Australia, including honeyeaters, {{has generally been}} described as occurring mainly in response <b>to</b> <b>external</b> environmental stimuli, such as food availability or an influx of water. However, the yellow-faced honeyeater {{has been found to}} have a broad range of characteristics that are more often associated with Northern Hemisphere migrants. These are an annual cycle of migratory restlessness, seasonally appropriate orientation based on magnetic, solar and polarised light cues, and a migration program based on the magnetic inclination compass.|$|E
50|$|Ratios {{relating}} reserves <b>to</b> other <b>external</b> sector {{variables are}} popular among credit risk agencies {{and international organizations}} <b>to</b> assess the <b>external</b> vulnerability of a country. For example, Article IV of 2013 uses total <b>external</b> debt <b>to</b> gross international reserves, gross international reserves in months of prospective goods and nonfactor services imports to broad money, broad money <b>to</b> short-term <b>external</b> debt, and short-term <b>external</b> debt <b>to</b> short-term <b>external</b> debt on residual maturity basis plus current account deficit. Therefore, countries with similar characteristics accumulate reserves to avoid negative assessment by the financial market, especially when compared to members of a peer group.|$|R

5|$|When {{a public}} {{authority}} fetters its discretion, it {{can either be}} said to have failed to exercise its discretionary power or to have been subject <b>to</b> <b>external</b> influences. In the Singapore High Court decision Lines International Holding (S) Pte. Ltd. v. Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (1997), two distinct forms of fettering of discretion were recognized: fettering of discretion through rigid adherence to a policy, and fettering of discretion by an unlawful delegation of authority. These two forms of fettering of discretion have been said to represent two elements defining the concept of discretion in administrative law – the first form relates to freedom of choice, and second form the notion of one's personal discretion.|$|E
5|$|When {{subjected}} <b>to</b> <b>external</b> forces, like electrical fields, {{the shape}} of an atom may deviate from spherical symmetry. The deformation depends on the field magnitude and the orbital type of outer shell electrons, as shown by group-theoretical considerations. Aspherical deviations might be elicited for instance in crystals, where large crystal-electrical fields may occur at low-symmetry lattice sites. Significant ellipsoidal deformations have been shown to occur for sulfur ions and chalcogen ions in pyrite-type compounds.|$|E

Sun Ce and Zhou Yu defeated Huang Zu with a naval fire attack at Xiakou and convinced Gan Ning to join them, and Zhou Yu inflicted a decisive defeat on Meng Huo's elephant troops in Nanman. To fix the problem with Cao Cao, Sun Jian allied with Liu Bei and defeated Cao Cao's fleet at Chi Bi.|$|E

5|$|Barn owls are hosts to a {{wide range}} of parasites. Fleas are present at nesting sites and {{externally}} the birds are attacked by feather lice and feather mites which chew the barbules of the feathers and which are transferred from bird to bird by direct contact. Blood-sucking flies such as Ornithomyia avicularia are often present, moving about among the plumage. Internal parasites include the fluke Strigea strigis, the tape worm Paruternia candelabraria, several species of parasitic round worm and spiny-headed worms in the genus Centrorhynchus. These gut parasites are acquired when the birds feed on infected prey which provide intermediate hosts for the parasites. There is some indication that female birds with more and larger spots have a greater resistance <b>to</b> <b>external</b> parasites. This is correlated with smaller bursae of Fabricius, glands associated with antibody production, and a lower fecundity of the blood-sucking fly Carnus hemapterus that attacks nestlings.|$|E
5|$|Baronial castles were {{of varying}} size and sophistication; some were classed as a caput, or the key stronghold {{of a given}} lord, and were usually larger and better {{fortified}} than the norm and usually held the local baronial honorial courts. The king continued to exercise the right to occupy and use any castle in the kingdom in response <b>to</b> <b>external</b> threats, in those cases he would staff the occupied castles with his own men; the king also retained the right to authorise {{the construction of new}} castles through the issuing of licenses to crenellate. It was possible for bishops to build or control castles, such as the important Devizes Castle linked to the Bishop of Salisbury, although this practice was challenged on occasion. In the 12th century the practice of castle-guards emerged in England and Wales, under which lands were assigned to local lords on condition that the recipient provided a certain number of knights or sergeants for the defence of a named castle. In some cases, such as at Dover, this arrangement became quite sophisticated with particular castle towers being named after particular families owing castle-guard duty.|$|E
5|$|Electricity {{is not a}} human invention, and may be {{observed}} in several forms in nature, a prominent manifestation of which is lightning. Many interactions familiar at the macroscopic level, such as touch, friction or chemical bonding, are due to interactions between electric fields on the atomic scale. The Earth's magnetic field is thought to arise from a natural dynamo of circulating currents in the planet's core. Certain crystals, such as quartz, or even sugar, generate a potential difference across their faces when subjected <b>to</b> <b>external</b> pressure. This phenomenon is known as piezoelectricity, from the Greek piezein (πιέζειν), meaning to press, and was discovered in 1880 by Pierre and Jacques Curie. The effect is reciprocal, and when a piezoelectric material is subjected to an electric field, a small change in physical dimensions takes place.|$|E
