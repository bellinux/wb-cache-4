5|$|Nellie Forbush, in {{her journey}} from Little Rock, Arkansas, to {{serving as a}} Navy nurse {{and on to the}} domesticity of the final scene of South Pacific, {{parallels}} the experience of many American women of the period. They entered the workforce during the war, only to find afterwards a societal expectation that they give up <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>to</b> men, with their best route to financial security being marriage and becoming a housewife. One means of securing audience acceptance of Nellie's choices was the sanitization of her sexual past from her counterpart in the Michener work– that character had a 4-F boyfriend back in Arkansas and a liaison with Bill Harbison while on the island.|$|E
5|$|The Ideas {{from the}} Deep team {{could not afford}} to leave <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>to</b> work on the game full-time, so they {{continued}} to work at Softdisk, spending their time on the Gamer's Edge games during the day and on Commander Keen at night and weekends using Softdisk computers. The group split into different roles: Hall became the game designer and creative director, John Carmack and Romero were the programmers, and Wilbur the manager. They invited artist Adrian Carmack from Softdisk to join them late in development, while Roathe was soon removed from the group. Ideas from the Deep spent nearly every waking moment when they were not working at Softdisk from October through December 1990 working on Commander Keen, with Wilbur forcing them to eat and take breaks.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{centralized}} {{policies and}} practices, the captains {{who ran the}} precincts or districts were relatively independent of headquarters, owing <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>to</b> neighborhood politicians. Decentralization meant that police could respond to local concerns, but graft often determined which concerns got most attention. In 1895, Chicago adopted civil service procedures, and written tests {{became the basis for}} hiring and promotion. Standards for recruits rose, though policing remained political.|$|E

In 1913 she had begun dating Morris Meyerson (Myerson). She was a committed Labor Zionist and he was a dedicated socialist. Together, they left <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>to</b> join a kibbutz in Palestine in 1921.|$|E
25|$|That changed quickly. An 1849 strike over a 15% wage cut ended {{after three}} weeks when workers feared losing <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>to</b> {{replacements}} that Olmstead had advertised for, but the company failed in 1851. Harmony Mills bought the plant and expanded it in 1859 with the middle section. By the later years of the century {{it was part of}} one of the largest cotton-production actions in the country.|$|E

25|$|In 1974, after Harold Wilson's {{defeat of}} Edward Heath, Castle became Secretary of State for Health and Social Services. While serving in this position, Castle {{introduced}} {{a wide range}} of innovative welfare reforms, including the introduction of the mobility allowance, the Invalid Care Allowance (July 1976) for single women and others who give up <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>to</b> care for severely disabled relatives, the introduction of a non-contributory invalidity pension for disabled persons who had not qualified for invalidity pension, reforms in child allowances, and the linking of most social security benefits to earnings rather than prices.|$|E
25|$|The {{level of}} {{education}} one has attained has played a large part in Mexican feminism. Schoolteachers, in most cultures, {{are some of the}} first women to enter the work force and the same was true in Mexico. Many of the early feminists who emerged from the Revolution were teachers either before or after the war, as were the participants of the Primer Congreso Feminista, the first feminist congress in Mexico. The participants in the Mexico 68 clashes who went on to form that generation's feminist movement were predominantly students and educators. The advisers who established themselves within the unions after the 1985 earthquakes were educated women who understood the legal and political aspects of organized labor. What they realized was that to form a sustained movement and attract working class women, they needed to utilize worker's expertise and knowledge of <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>to</b> meld a practical, working system.|$|E
25|$|An {{unprecedented}} {{amount of}} personal investing {{occurred during the}} boom, and the press reported the phenomenon of people quitting <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>to</b> engage in full-time day trading. The value of the Nasdaq Composite stock market index, which includes many technology companies, rose from 1,000 in 1995 to 5,000 in the year 2000. By {{the end of the}} 1990s, the NASDAQ Composite reached a price–earnings ratio of 200, dwarfing the peak price–earnings ratio of 80 for the Japanese Nikkei 225 during the Japanese asset price bubble of 1991. In 1999, shares of Qualcomm rose in value by 2,619% and 12 other large-cap stocks each rose over 1,000%. Even though the Nasdaq stock market index rose 85.6% and the S 500 stock market index rose 19.5% in 1999, more stocks fell in value than rose in value, as investors sold stocks in slower growing companies to invest in Internet stocks.|$|E

He was born in Salisbury, Wiltshire, England, to Ian Douglas Mitchell and Kathy Grey Mitchell (née Hughes), who then worked as hotel managers.

500|$|In January, caucuses {{were held}} in local districts to pick delegates. The state {{conventions}} would then select {{a number of these}} delegates to represent the state at the national convention. Prior to the convention, {{there was a great deal}} of machine politics conducted by the candidates. John Sherman utilized Treasury Department employees who owed <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>to</b> him to meet up at local caucuses across the South to guarantee loyal state delegations. State-level bosses, like Roscoe Conkling, used the state conventions to pick delegates that were politically allied to a particular candidate. In the state delegate-selection convention at Utica, New York, Grant's supporters carried only a 217–180 majority over Blaine supporters, but Conkling passed a resolution declaring that, [...] "the Republicans of New York believe the re-election of Ulysses S. Grant as Presidential candidate of urgent importance, and the delegates this day assembled are called upon and instructed to use their earnest and united efforts to secure his nomination.|$|E
500|$|One {{point of}} dispute was the {{calculation}} of Malay equity. Although officially, as of 1992, the Malays controlled 18% of the economy, some dismissed this figure as misleading. It was argued that as in reality, much of this amount comprised equity held by government agencies, therefore it belonged to Malaysians as a whole. The practice of awarding public works contracts mainly to Bumiputras was argued to be stifling Malay competency by providing little incentive to improve. Many Bumiputra contractors in turn subcontracted <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>to</b> others, who were in some cases Chinese; [...] "Ali Baba" [...] arrangements with [...] "the Malay [...] using his privileges to acquire licences and permits denied the non-Malay, then accepting a fee to be the front-man while the non-Malay [...] ran the business," [...] were prevalent. Some suggested that the NEP [...] "might have worked, if the Malay had actually wanted to learn the ropes. But more often than not, {{he just wanted to}} be rich." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1927, {{territorial}} designations {{were adopted}} and the battalion assumed {{the title of}} the [...] "Hawthorn Regiment". Three years later this was changed to the [...] "Hawthorne–Kew Regiment". It assumed the motto of Factis Non Verbis in 1927. Initially, the battalion was kept up to strength with volunteers and men serving {{under the terms of the}} compulsory training scheme, but in 1929 the scheme was suspended by the newly elected Scullin Labor government and the Citizen Forces were renamed the Militia. The combination of the end to compulsory training and the financial hardships of the Great Depression meant that there were few volunteers available as men could not risk losing <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>to</b> undertake training and as a result throughout the 1930s a number of units were amalgamated or disbanded as the size of the Army was reduced. In 1937, [...] the 39th Battalion was merged with the 37th Battalion, before later being delinked with the 37th in August 1939 and being amalgamated with the 24th Battalion, becoming the 24th/39th Battalion. An alliance with the Dorsetshire Regiment was approved in 1930.|$|E
500|$|Delrina {{was founded}} in Toronto in 1988 by Zimbabwean {{expatriate}} Bert Amato, South African expatriates Mark Skapinker and Dennis Bennie and American Lou Ryan. Delrina was Bennie's third major entrepreneurial start up after co-founding Mission Electronics, a high-end home entertainment equipment producer, and Aviva Software, which became Ingram Micro Canada. Delrina's business strategy was to [...] "establish technical and market leadership in niche markets", which it accomplished with its electronic form and PC-based fax software. A year before the firm was incorporated, Amato and Skapinker had quit <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>to</b> start work on an electronic forms product which would eventually become PerForm. Both would later meet with Bennie, {{who was then the}} co-founder and CEO of Ingram Micro Canada before becoming CEO of Carolian Systems International, a firm that made business software for Hewlett-Packard. Bennie facilitated an initial seed investment of $1.5 million CAD to finance a new start-up company, [...] "Delrina", to develop this idea. In return, Carolian received 51% of Delrina's shares, Dennis Bennie would become Chairman and CEO, Mark Skapinker President, and Bert Amato CTO of newly formed Delrina Technology Inc.|$|E
500|$|As the 1884 presidential {{election}} approached, James G. Blaine {{was considered the}} favorite for the Republican nomination, but Arthur, too, contemplated a run for a full term as president. [...] In {{the months leading up}} to the 1884 Republican National Convention, however, Arthur began to realize that neither faction of the Republican party was prepared to give him their full support: the Half-Breeds were again solidly behind Blaine, while Stalwarts were undecided; some backed Arthur, with others considering Senator John A. Logan of Illinois. [...] Reform-minded Republicans, friendlier to Arthur after he endorsed civil service reform, were still not certain enough of his reform credentials to back him over Senator George F. Edmunds of Vermont, who had long favored their cause. [...] Business leaders supported him, as did Southern Republicans who owed <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>to</b> his control of the patronage, but by the time they began to rally around him, Arthur had decided against a serious campaign for the nomination. [...] He kept up a token effort, believing that to drop out would cast doubt on his actions in office and raise questions about his health, but by the time the convention began in June, his defeat was assured. [...] Blaine led on the first ballot, and by the fourth ballot he had a majority. Arthur telegraphed his congratulations to Blaine and accepted his defeat with equanimity. [...] He played no role in the 1884 campaign, which Blaine would later blame for his loss that November to the Democratic nominee, Grover Cleveland.|$|E

500|$|The Ideas {{from the}} Deep team, who {{referred}} {{to themselves as}} the [...] "IFD guys", {{could not afford to}} leave <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>to</b> work on the game full-time, so they continued to work at Softdisk making Gamer's Edge games during the day while working on Commander Keen at night. They also continued to take home their work computers to Carmack's house on the weekends, putting them in their cars at night and bringing them back in the morning before anyone else arrived; they even began to request upgrades to the computers from Softdisk, nominally for their work. The group split into different roles: Hall became the game designer and creative director, John Carmack and Romero were the programmers, and Wilbur the manager. They invited artist Adrian Carmack from Softdisk to join them late in development, while Roathe was soon kicked out of the group; Romero, the self-appointed leader of the team, liked him but felt that his work ethic did not match well {{with the rest of the}} team and pushed for his removal. Ideas from the Deep spent nearly every waking moment when they were not working at Softdisk from October through December 1990 working on Commander Keen, with Wilbur forcing them to eat and take breaks. Several members of the team have mentioned in interviews as an example of the team's commitment a night during development when a heavy storm flooded the path to get to the house, preventing them from working, and John Romero waded through a flooding river to make it to the house anyway.|$|E
2500|$|Major {{efforts were}} made to improve access to housing and health care, while the {{government}} also attempted to tackle working-class under-achievement in schools by reinforcing the comprehensive system, modernising the curriculum and reducing streaming. As a means of increasing political participation, the government increased the financial allowances of local politicians, who also became entitled to paid leave from <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>to</b> attend courses in public administration. Allowances for the handicapped were improved, while improvements were also made in the pay and conditions for those serving in the army. A decree of January 1982 provided for [...] "solidarity contracts" [...] whereby firms would be subsidised for introducing part-time work or early retirement if they also allowed the creation of new jobs, while a decree of March 1982 provided employees with the right to retire at the age of 60 on 50% of average earnings during their 10 best years of employment. In 1983, legislation was passed to encourage greater equality in the private sector. Firms now had to make an annual report on the training opportunities and employment conditions for women and present a statistical analysis of their position in the firm, whilst the works committee had to ensure that equality promoting measures are taken. In addition, a new benefit was introduced for unemployed workers who had exhausted their eligibility for unemployment insurance. In December 1982, a law was passed that restored to workers the right to elect administrators to social security funds, which had been elimated by Charles De Gaulle in 1967.|$|E
6000|$|Yet {{with all}} his shamelessness, his pensiveness, his elegance, I felt that somehow our {{national}} triumph was not complete in him,--that there were yet more finished forms of self-abasement in the Old World, till one day I looked {{out of the window}} and saw at a little distance my veteran digging a cellar for an Irishman. I own that the spectacle gave me a shock of pleasure, and that I ran down to have a nearer view of what human eyes have seldom, if ever, beheld,--an American, pure blood, handling the pick, the shovel, and the wheelbarrow, while an Irishman directed his labors. Upon inspection, it appeared that none of the trees grew with their roots in the air, in recognition of this great reversal of the natural law; all the French-roof houses stood right side up. The phenomenon may become more common in future, unless the American race accomplishes its destiny of dying out before the more populatory foreigner, but as yet it graced the veteran with an exquisite and signal distinction. He, however, seemed to feel unpleasantly the anomaly of his case, and opened the conversation by saying that he should not work at that job to-morrow, it hurt his side; and went on to complain of the inhumanity of Americans to Americans. [...] "Why," [...] said he, [...] "they'd rather give out <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>to</b> a nigger than to one of their own kind. I was beatin' carpets for a gentleman on the Avenue, and the first thing I know he give most of 'em to a nigger.
