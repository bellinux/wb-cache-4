50|$|After his father's {{death in}} 1313, Bolesław {{inherited}} the Duchies of Wieluń and Niemodlin. Until 1323, he exercised the guardianship {{on behalf of}} his <b>younger</b> brothers, then <b>too</b> <b>youngs</b> for rule by their own.

5|$|A Lebanese {{passport}} {{is invalid}} if the passport is not signed, and normally the bearer affixes his/her signature on the signature field, whose position has varied with various incarnations of Lebanese passports.

5|$|A catchy jingle and ad campaign, it {{has come}} to embody a piece of Americana, and has even seeped into the {{consciousness}} of people who were <b>too</b> <b>young</b> (or not even alive) to remember the campaign when it occurred. The slogan was so well-remembered that it was added to Simpson's Contemporary Quotations in 1988.|$|E

5|$|At age 16, Bure {{began his}} {{professional}} hockey career playing for CSKA Moscow. He {{was invited to}} the senior club's training camp for the 1987–88 season.

They split up after a few months and Jansch was eventually repatriated to Britain after catching dysentery in Tangiers.|$|E
5|$|Born in 1989, Liukin was {{ten months}} <b>too</b> <b>young</b> to compete {{as a senior}} in 2004, and thus was not {{eligible}} for {{a place on the}} U.S. team for the 2004 Olympics in Athens.

She hoped to marry and have a large family.|$|E
5|$|Early line-ups of the Strand—sometimes {{known as}} the Swankers—also {{included}} Jim Mackin on organ and Stephen Hayes (and later, briefly, Del Noones) on bass.

5|$|Fincher's {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Marla Singer was Janeane Garofalo, who objected to the film's sexual content. The filmmakers {{considered}} Courtney Love and Winona Ryder as early candidates. The studio wanted to cast Reese Witherspoon, but Fincher objected that she was <b>too</b> <b>young</b> for the role. He chose to cast Bonham Carter based on her performance in the 1997 film The Wings of the Dove.|$|E

5|$|In 1893, {{when he was}} eighteen, Monteux {{married a}} fellow student, the pianist Victoria Barrière. With her he played the {{complete}} Beethoven violin sonatas in public.

5|$|In West African cultures, {{women with}} long hair were highly valued. Long, thick hair {{was seen as a}} sign of health, strength, and {{capability}} to bear many children.

This tradition, however, did not extend to every West African culture, as several valued shorter hair.|$|E
