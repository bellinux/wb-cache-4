5|$|At low forward speeds, the {{precession}} of {{the front}} wheel is too quick, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency <b>to</b> <b>oversteer,</b> start to lean {{the other way and}} eventually oscillate and fall over. At high forward speeds, the precession is usually too slow, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to understeer and eventually fall over without ever having reached the upright position. This instability is very slow, on the order of seconds, and is easy for most riders to counteract. Thus a fast bike may feel stable even though it is actually not self-stable and would fall over if it were uncontrolled.|$|E
500|$|Friday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session {{lasted for}} 90 minutes. The cars went out {{one at a}} time in the reverse order of the fastest combined practice laps. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. The session took place in dry and sunny weather conditions. Bräck recorded the track speed record at Rockingham Motor Speedway and secured his first pole position of the season, the seventh of his CART career, as well as his second at the circuit, with a time of 24.908 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by Michael Andretti who set a lap time two-hundredths of a second slower than Bräck. Da Matta qualified third. He had removed his foot from the accelerator pedal when driving through the fourth turn and felt he could have started from first place. Takagi took fourth, and Franchitti started fifth after steering right to the track's outside on his second lap due <b>to</b> <b>oversteer</b> and reduced his speed preventing him from setting a faster time. Junqueira's car was set up with a large amount of downforce which restricted him to sixth, and Paul Tracy secured seventh because his car slid in the third and fourth turns. Tony Kanaan qualified in eighth and was satisfied with his lap which was recorded in a back-up car.|$|E
2500|$|The race {{began at}} 14:00 Central Time Zone (...) [...] Weather {{conditions}} {{at the start of}} the race were dry and sunny with an air temperature of [...] and a track temperature between [...] 107,778 people attended the race. Every driver, except for Vettel, Kvyat and Hülkenberg, started on soft compound tyres. A strong cross wind cutting through the third and fifth turns caused cars <b>to</b> <b>oversteer.</b> When the race started, Rosberg made a fast getaway to maintain the lead heading into the first corner. Hamilton. who put his car at an angle towards Rosberg on the starting position, maintained second position. Bottas had wheelspin off the line, enabling teammate Massa to get ahead of him. Alonso attempted to overtake Bottas for fourth heading into the second turn but reduced his speed in his attempt. Ricciardo also had wheelspin off his starting position, and fell behind both Ferrari and McLaren cars. He remained on the outside line and overtook Button and Räikkönen and attacked Magnussen, passing him driving into turn 12. Pérez glimpsed space around the inside of Sutil but the additional speed required to drive alongside the Sauber meant he slid into the rear-end of Räikkönen's car. Räikkonen was able to continue but Pérez ploughed into Sutil. As the Sauber spun, it hit Pérez for a second time; both their front wheels interlocked and their suspensions were damaged.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} <b>to</b> induce <b>oversteer</b> at 30 mph (50 km/h), which is {{well in the}} cruise speed range. However, {{it is not likely}} that in real life the driver would change the steering input from hard left to hard right within 2 seconds.|$|R
50|$|The Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA) was {{introduced}} by Honda to its vehicles in 1997. The term is Honda's version of Electronic Stability Control (ESC), an active safety feature developed <b>to</b> correct <b>oversteer</b> and understeer by using several sensors to detect loss of steering control and traction while simultaneously braking individual wheels to help the vehicle regain stability.|$|R
50|$|Major {{changes over}} the E21 include {{interior}} features and revised suspension (<b>to</b> reduce the <b>oversteer</b> {{for which the}} E21 was criticised). As per the E21, a Baur convertible was available.|$|R
5000|$|Triumph TR2, and TR3 - began <b>to</b> <b>oversteer</b> more {{suddenly}} {{when their}} inside rear wheel lifted.|$|E
5000|$|When {{cornering}} under acceleration on {{a slippery}} surface, the rear axle is engaged with delay, causing sudden {{change in the}} car's behaviour (from understeer <b>to</b> <b>oversteer).</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{variable}} {{handling characteristics}} of a four-wheel-drive car mean that when travelling round a corner at high speeds the car may enter the corner and understeer and then half-way through the corner suddenly start <b>to</b> <b>oversteer.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The car's strong {{points were}} {{described}} as generally very good handling, good steering in urban areas, generous equipment and a powerful engine. The weak points were the car's poor packaging, confusing dashboard, poor ergonomics, poorly designed seats, tendency <b>to</b> lift-off <b>oversteer</b> and high fuel consumption. The Autocar verdict was that the Lancia Trevi had [...] "the performance and economy to appeal to Lancia enthusiasts." ...|$|R
50|$|Electronic Stability Program (ESP): {{standard}} on the S-Class since the W220 model and {{similar to the}} systems fitted to other Mercedes vehicles, this system measures driver inputs and compares these to the vehicle's path. If these diverge, ESP brakes single wheels selectively <b>to</b> eliminate <b>oversteer</b> (fishtailing) and understeer (plowing), and reduces engine power, if necessary. ESP includes anti-lock braking (ABS) and traction control (ASR) within its wider functions.|$|R
50|$|Cons: Increased tire {{wear and}} {{noticeable}} impact on driving behavior. During cornering, which half-axle is uncoupled {{is dependent on}} torque direction applied by the driveline. When the torque direction is reversed, {{the speed of the}} driveline is suddenly forced to change from the inner to outer axle, accompanied by tire chirping and a large jerk. During cornering, the automatic locker is characterized by heavy understeer which transitions instantly <b>to</b> power <b>oversteer</b> when traction is exceeded.|$|R
5000|$|Reduction in {{cornering}} forces due {{to change in}} camber can lead <b>to</b> <b>oversteer</b> [...] - [...] a dynamically unstable condition where a vehicle can lose control and spin [...] - [...] and in extreme cases lift-off oversteer.|$|E
50|$|Tadpoles {{are more}} stable under braking {{and more likely}} to slide instead of roll; front braking hard on a delta {{requires}} the vehicle to steer almost straight to avoid tipping. The balance of friction patches and rolling resistance also means that tadpoles tend <b>to</b> <b>oversteer</b> and deltas understeer.|$|E
50|$|A rear-wheel drive, rear-engine vehicle {{tends to}} be prone <b>to</b> <b>oversteer</b> which allows for tighter turner radius {{than that of a}} neutral or {{understeer}} condition of a vehicle, however this causes vehicle instability. For this reason rear-engine design has been abandoned as a design option for regular passenger cars, but still maintains a viability for race applications.|$|E
50|$|When Car and Driver took a 2013 Genesis Coupe 3.8 R-Spec to Virginia International Raceway for its yearly Lightning Lap time trial, they {{posted a}} time of 3:13.9 around VIR's Grand West configuration, 0.1 second slower than the 306-hp 2011 Genesis Coupe 3.8 R-Spec and slower than the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, Ford Mustang V6, Chevrolet Cobalt SS and Nissan NISMO 370Z. They were {{unsettled}} by its tendency <b>to</b> power <b>oversteer,</b> and its brake fade.|$|R
5000|$|Electronic {{stability}} control (ESC) is {{a computerized}} technology that improves {{the safety of}} a vehicle's stability by attempting to detect and prevent skids. When ESC detects loss of steering control, the system applies individual brakes to help [...] "steer" [...] the vehicle where the driver wants to go. Braking is automatically applied to individual wheels, such as the outer front wheel <b>to</b> counter <b>oversteer,</b> or the inner rear wheel to counter understeer.|$|R
50|$|The Weissach axle (pronounced 'Vise-' as in 'advise' and '-ach' with {{guttural}} 'ch') is {{a special}} rear suspension arrangement devised for the Porsche 928. The goal of the Weissach axle was <b>to</b> eliminate lift-throttle <b>oversteer</b> by allowing the rear suspension to adjust itself during cornering maneuvers.|$|R
50|$|Porsche {{is one of}} the few {{remaining}} manufacturers using the rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout (RR). The motor's distributed weight across the wheels, in a Porsche 911, provides excellent traction, but the significant mass behind the rear wheels makes it more prone <b>to</b> <b>oversteer</b> in some situations. Porsche has continuously refined the design and in recent years added electonic stability control to counteract these inherent design shortcomings.|$|E
50|$|This type of {{oversteer}} {{is often}} more pronounced in rear-engined cars and cars with swing axle rear suspension. Rearward centers of gravity (such as older Porsche 911s) enhance this effect, though technically any vehicle can experience lift-off oversteer. Various suspension enhancements, such as a Weissach axle, Passive rear wheel steering, or a multi-link suspension, can limit a vehicle's tendency <b>to</b> <b>oversteer</b> in this situation.|$|E
5000|$|The Weissach axle is {{a variant}} of the {{semi-trailing}} arm suspension. The tendency of a vehicle <b>to</b> <b>oversteer</b> when decelerating is compounded by the compliant bushings found in most trailing arm suspensions. When the vehicle is decelerating, the trailing arm pivots towards the rear as the wheel is [...] "pulled" [...] backwards relative to the chassis. This results in toe out, which makes the vehicle unstable.|$|E
2500|$|Tire {{pressure}} differential: As {{with the}} Renault Dauphine and pre-1968 Volkswagen Beetle, Corvair engineers {{relied on a}} cost-free tire pressure differential <b>to</b> eliminate <b>oversteer</b> characteristics [...] low front and high rear tire pressurea strategy which induced understeer (increasing front slip angles faster than the rear). Nonetheless, the strategy offered a significant disadvantage: owners and mechanics could inadvertently but easily re-introduce oversteer characteristics by over-inflating the front tires (e.g., to typical pressures for other cars with other, more prevalent suspension systems). [...] The recommended low front tire pressure also compromised the tire load capacity.|$|R
50|$|During {{the first}} run, Schiegl and Schiegl survived a crash on Turn 16 {{where they came}} in too high. Tobias tried <b>to</b> correct the <b>oversteer</b> only <b>to</b> have the cousins collide on the {{opposite}} side of the ice wall, causing both cousins to go airborne momentarily. Neither cousin suffered any injury.|$|R

50|$|Along {{with the}} revised bodywork, {{mechanically}} the 993 also featured an all-new multilink rear suspension that improved the car's ride and handling. This rear suspension was largely {{derived from the}} stillborn Porsche 989's rear multilink design, and served to rectify the problems with earlier models' tendency <b>to</b> <b>oversteer</b> if the throttle or brakes were applied mid-corner. These modifications also reduced previous 911's lift-off oversteer problems to a much more moderate degree.|$|E
5000|$|... "The Mondial {{exhibited}} {{more predictable}} behavior than its two-seat relatives pushing gently {{into a corner}} and announcing its intention <b>to</b> <b>oversteer</b> in advance...the Mondial t {{does not have the}} nervous feel of the 348...raw speed is not the essence of a car like the Mondial, plenty of other cars can go as fast, but none with the sound and feel of the prancing horse." [...] John Davis, MotorWeek ...|$|E
50|$|In {{steady-state}} cornering, front-heavy cars tend {{to understeer}} and rear-heavy cars <b>to</b> <b>oversteer</b> (Understeer & Oversteer explained), {{all other things}} being equal. The mid-engine design seeks to achieve the ideal center of mass, though front-engine design {{has the advantage of}} permitting a more practical engine-passenger-baggage layout. All other parameters being equal, at the hands of an expert driver a neutrally balanced mid-engine car can corner faster, but a FR (front-engined, rear-wheel drive) layout car is easier to drive at the limit.|$|E
5000|$|Tire {{pressure}} differential: The Renault Dauphine, Volkswagen Beetle {{and first}} generation Chevrolet Corvair (1960-1964) used a tire pressure differential strategy <b>to</b> eliminate <b>oversteer</b> characteristics of their swing axle suspensions — specifically low front and high rear tire pressure [...] - [...] which induced understeer. Nonetheless, the tire pressure differential strategy offered a significant disadvantage: owners and mechanics could inadvertently but easily re-introduce oversteer characteristics by over-inflating the front tires (that is, to typical pressures for other cars with other suspension systems) or by inflating all four tires {{to the same}} pressure. The effectiveness of this option was criticized in lawsuits in the US during the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|From the factory, {{the system}} is set up <b>to</b> provide slight <b>oversteer</b> in handling, {{and in fact the}} harder the car is cornered, the LESS the AWD system engages the front wheels. This {{promotes}} the oversteer rather than understeer which is apparent in most AWD/4WD vehicles. The advantage to a more traditional ATTESA (Viscous LSD) system is response in hundredths of a second.|$|R
5000|$|Oversteer - {{the rear}} wheels tend to crawl or slip towards {{the outside of the}} turn more than the front. The driver must correct by {{steering}} away from the corner, otherwise the car is liable to spin, if pushed <b>to</b> its limit. <b>Oversteer</b> is sometimes useful, to assist in steering, especially if it occurs only when the driver chooses it by applying power.|$|R
5000|$|Compared with Gran Turismo, the gameplay, {{physics and}} {{graphics}} are very similar: {{the only real}} noticeable difference in vehicle dynamics was the brakes, which became {{much less likely to}} lock up and cause the vehicle <b>to</b> <b>oversteer.</b> The major changes are the vastly expanded number of cars, tracks and races in simulation mode. Other differences include that the player can race events separately, if he/she does not want to enter the whole tournament. The player is no longer able to [...] "qualify" [...] for each race entered.|$|E
50|$|Coupled {{with special}} {{suspension}} specifically optimized for M that features Adaptive Drive {{and the newly}} developed M Servotronic power steering, the performance Sport Activity Vehicle promises very competent handling. Other high-tech features include launch control for maximum acceleration and a six-speed M Sport automatic transmission optimized for performance. Drivers can manually select gears using either paddles or an electronic gear selector lever. Electronically controlled, variable power distribution {{to the front and}} rear axle prevents the tendency <b>to</b> <b>oversteer</b> or understeer, before DSC Dynamic Stability Control is required to cut in.|$|E
50|$|The {{disadvantage}} to a rear weight bias is {{that the}} car can become unstable and tend <b>to</b> <b>oversteer,</b> especially when decelerating (whether braking or lifting off the throttle; see lift-off oversteer). When this happens, rotational inertia dictates that the added weight away from the axis of rotation (generally the steering wheels) {{will be more likely}} to maintain the spin, especially under braking. This is an inherent instability in the design, making it easier to induce and more difficult to recover from a slide than in a less rear-weight-biased vehicle.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{run of the}} men's doubles luge {{competition}} on 17 February 2010, Austria's team of Tobias Schiegl and Markus Schiegl survived a crash on turn 16 where they came in at too high of an elevation. Tobias tried <b>to</b> correct the <b>oversteer</b> only <b>to</b> have the cousins collide {{on the opposite side}} of the ice wall, causing both to go airborne momentarily. Neither suffered any injury.|$|R
50|$|Scandinavian rally drivers were, {{and still}} are, {{predominantly}} {{the best in}} Europe for driving in ice and snow conditions, due to their inclement weather in winter months. Because they drove on ice and snow regularly, {{they were the first}} drivers to develop techniques to drive at speed in these slippery conditions. (They also pioneered using the snowbanks on corner exit to straighten out the car.) Since the concept was understood and developed, it has also found its way into drifting and tarmac driving events. It has even gone as far as Australia, where it has been used <b>to</b> induce <b>oversteer</b> in V8 Supercars. The Japanese name of this technique, Manji drift, is named after a Japanese meaning of swastika for the likeness of drift lines.|$|R
2500|$|The 2004 model S2000 {{underwent}} several significant changes. Production {{moved to}} Suzuka. The new model introduced [...] wheels and Bridgestone RE-050 tires {{along with a}} retuned suspension <b>to</b> reduce <b>oversteer.</b> The spring rates and shock absorber damping were altered and the suspension geometry modified to improve stability by reducing toe-in changes under cornering loads. The subframe also received a revision in design to achieve a high rigidity. In the gearbox the brass synchronizers were replaced with carbon fiber. In addition, cosmetic changes {{were made to the}} exterior with new front and rear bumpers, revised headlight assemblies, new LED tail-lights, and oval-tipped exhausts. Although all the cosmetic, suspension and most drivetrain upgrades were included on the Japanese, Australian and European S2000s, they retained the 2.0l F20C engines and remained designated as AP1s.|$|R
