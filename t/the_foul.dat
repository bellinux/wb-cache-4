5|$|Five {{minutes before}} half-time, Juventus were awarded a free-kick. Boniek, who had beaten three Liverpool players with a run, was brought down outside the Liverpool penalty area by Wark, who {{received}} a yellow card for <b>the</b> <b>foul.</b> The resulting free-kick came to nothing, and at half-time the score was 0–0. Almost immediately after the restart, Liverpool suffered another injury. Paul Walsh stretched to reach a pass from Neal, aggravated a stomach strain {{and was replaced by}} Craig Johnston. Juventus were gaining an ascendancy in the match, and in the 56th minute they were awarded a penalty kick. Boniek again went on a run through the centre of the Liverpool defence and was brought down by Gillespie. Liverpool believed that <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> was outside the area, but the Swiss referee, from some 25 yards (22.86 m.) behind the ball, awarded the penalty. Michel Platini scored the subsequent penalty to give Juventus a 1–0 lead.|$|E

A technique capable of early diagnosis, process monitoring, and evaluation of the role of different foulants playing in <b>the</b> <b>fouling</b> process is crucial for <b>the</b> <b>fouling</b> control. We develop surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) as a new and versatile tool to investigate <b>the</b> <b>fouling</b> process of protein on PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) membranes as well as <b>the</b> <b>fouling</b> propensity of three different proteins. We optimized the aggregation level and volume of SERS-active Ag sol and the spectra acquisition method combined with a statistical analysis method to ensure a high detection sensitivity, signal uniformity, and stability. We then used SEAS for the early diagnosis of <b>the</b> <b>fouling</b> process and determining when the membrane pores would be blocked. <b>The</b> <b>fouled</b> area was visualized by a combination of the silver staining and Raman mapping. <b>The</b> <b>fouling</b> propensity of different proteins was studied by comparing the relative SERS band intensities of different proteins on a glass slide and after membrane filtration. Compared with fluorescence-based techniques, the narrow, well-resolved Raman band, especially the use of the same excitation line and laser power, endows SEAS the ability to compare <b>the</b> <b>fouling</b> propensity in a very simple way.

5|$|The game {{is played}} on a field whose primary boundaries, <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> lines, extend forward from home plate at 45-degree angles. The 90-degree area within <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> lines is {{referred}} to as fair territory; the 270-degree area outside them is foul territory. The part of the field enclosed by the bases and several yards beyond them is the infield; the area farther beyond the infield is the outfield. In the middle of the infield is a raised pitcher's mound, with a rectangular rubber plate (the rubber) at its center. The outer boundary of the outfield is typically demarcated by a raised fence, which may be of any material and height (many amateur games are played on unfenced fields). The fair territory between home plate and the outfield boundary is baseball's field of play, though significant events can take place in foul territory, as well.|$|E

5|$|Any {{baseball}} game involves {{one or more}} umpires, who make rulings {{on the outcome of}} each play. At a minimum, one umpire will stand behind the catcher, to have {{a good view of the}} strike zone, and call balls and strikes. Additional umpires may be stationed near the other bases, thus making it easier to judge plays such as attempted force outs and tag outs. In Major League Baseball, four umpires are used for each game, one near each base. In the playoffs, six umpires are used: one at each base and two in the outfield along <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> lines.|$|E

40|$|An {{operating}} {{model for}} dead-end membrane filtration is proposed {{based on the}} well-known blocking laws. The resulting model contains three parameters representing, the operating strategy, <b>the</b> <b>fouling</b> mechanism and <b>the</b> <b>fouling</b> potential of <b>the</b> feed. The optimal control strategy is determined by minimizing the energy consumption for a fixed final time and produced volume. It was found that constant power filtration leads to minimal energy consumption. Constant flux and constant pressure filtration have equal energy costs. However, compared to strategies with a non-decreasing pressure and non-increasing flux, the relative savings are small. Only if <b>the</b> <b>fouling</b> mechanism resembles standard blocking and <b>the</b> <b>fouling</b> resistance is large compared to the membrane resistance, it may be attractive to implement the optimal trajectory. ...|$|R
50|$|The most {{straightforward}} way {{to quantify}} fairly uniform fouling is by stating the average deposit surface loading, i.e., kg of deposit per m² of surface area. <b>The</b> <b>fouling</b> rate {{will then be}} expressed in kg/m²s, and it is obtained by dividing the deposit surface loading by the effective operating time. <b>The</b> normalized <b>fouling</b> rate (also in kg/m²s) will additionally account for the concentration of the foulant in the process fluid (kg/kg) during preceding operations, and is useful for comparison of fouling rates between different systems. It is obtained by dividing <b>the</b> <b>fouling</b> rate by <b>the</b> foulant concentration. <b>The</b> <b>fouling</b> rate constant (m/s) {{can be obtained by}} dividing <b>the</b> normalized <b>fouling</b> rate by <b>the</b> mass density of the process fluid (kg/m³).|$|R
40|$|Brazed plate heat exchanges (BPHEs) and {{tube-in-tube}} {{heat exchangers}} (TTHEs) {{are commonly used}} in the refrigeration, air conditioning, and food industry as refrigerant-to-water condensers, in which refrigerant rejects heat to water circulating in cooling tower loops. These heat exchangers often suffer from severe fouling issues because as {{the water in the}} cooling tower evaporates, the mineral concentration in the remaining water increases. Once the solubility limits are reached, the minerals precipitate and deposit on the heat transfer surfaces: an undesirable yet unavoidable phenomenon. Due to <b>the</b> <b>fouling</b> deposit on <b>the</b> heat transfer surfaces, the thermal resistance between refrigerant and water gradually increases. <b>The</b> <b>fouling</b> resistance depends on several factors such as heat exchanger geometry, heat flux, water quality and water flow rates. <b>The</b> <b>fouling</b> factors penalize <b>the</b> overall effectiveness of the refrigerant condensers and thus must be properly accounted for during the equipment design. Predictions of <b>the</b> <b>fouling</b> allowances during <b>the</b> life service of the condenser characterize the degradation in thermal performance and provide guidelines about the maintenance and service of this type of equipment. In this work, a smooth TTHE was investigated by using a new experimental facility at Oklahoma State University. The aim was to measure <b>the</b> <b>fouling</b> resistance in real time and correlate the data with the water quality and heat flux inside the refrigeration condenser. <b>The</b> <b>fouling</b> resistance in <b>the</b> TTHE was observed to have asymptotic trend and the asymptotic limit was lower than that for BPHEs with soft corrugation angles and higher than that of BHPEs with hard corrugation angles operating at similar conditions. The hydraulic performance was similar as BPHEs with hard corrugation angles. <b>The</b> <b>fouling</b> deposit inside <b>the</b> tube-in-tube heat exchanger was further analyzed by using a CCD camera with a borescope probe and by adopting a chemical digestion process for <b>the</b> <b>fouling</b> particles inside <b>the</b> tubes. <b>Fouling</b> did not deposit uniformly inside the TTHE and it was evident that more fouling was present at the outlet section of the water side.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>fouling</b> of {{a reverse}} osmosis {{membrane}} {{after one year}} of service in a brackish water treatment plant was investigated. It {{has been found that}} <b>the</b> extent of <b>fouling</b> was uneven across the membrane surface with regions underneath or near the strands of the feed spacer being more severely affected. This is attributed to the local variations in the hydrodynamic conditions, partly due to the effect of the feed spacer.

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 A bench-scale {{thermosiphon}} reboiler {{system was}} constructed end used {{to investigate the}} scaling behavior of aqueous calcium sulfate under flow boiling conditions. Scaling data were collected at constant heat flux from eight experimental runs. Five different constant heat fluxes were used ranging from 45000 to 93000 Btu/hr. ft², in increments of approximately 12000 Btu/hr-ft². Scaling behavior was quantified by combining measured temperature and heat flux data to obtain corresponding local fouling factors. Fouling factors reflect changes in the overall heat transfer coefficient, and are proportional {{to the amount of}} accumulated scale. Plotting <b>the</b> <b>fouling</b> factors versus time showed that a typical plot was composed of three fouling periods. During an initial delay period <b>the</b> <b>fouling</b> factor remained constant, or increased relatively slowly. Following this period, <b>the</b> <b>fouling</b> factor increased much more rapidly, and did so linearly. During the final period, <b>the</b> <b>fouling</b> factor increased at a declining rate.
