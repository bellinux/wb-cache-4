40|$|<b>The</b> two <b>minerals</b> borickyite and delvauxite CaFe 3 + 4 (PO 4,SO 4) 2 (OH) 8 • 4 - 6 H 2 O {{have the}} same formula. Are <b>the</b> <b>minerals</b> {{identical}} or different? <b>The</b> <b>minerals</b> borickyite and delvauxite have been characterised by Raman spectroscopy. <b>The</b> <b>minerals</b> are related to <b>the</b> <b>minerals</b> diadochite and destinezite. Both minerals are amorphous. Delvauxite appears to vary in crystallinity from amorphous to semi-crystalline. <b>The</b> <b>minerals</b> are often X-ray non-diffracting. <b>The</b> <b>minerals</b> are found in soils and may be described as ‘colloidal’ minerals. Vibrational spectroscopy enables {{an assessment of the}} molecular structure of borickyite and delvauxite. Bands are assigned to phosphate and sulphate stretching and bending modes. Multiple water bending and stretching modes imply that non-equivalent water molecules in the structure exist with different hydrogen bond strengths. <b>The</b> two <b>minerals</b> show differing spectra and must be considered as different minerals...|$|R

The town engaged John McLaren, landscape architect of San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, to design the park, renamed Lithia Springs Park, later shortened to Lithia Park.
