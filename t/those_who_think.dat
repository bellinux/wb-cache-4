One of the examining pathologists, Thomas Bond, believed this to be a Ripper murder, though his colleague George Bagster Phillips, who had examined the bodies of three previous victims, disagreed. Later writers are also divided between <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>think</b> that her murderer copied the Ripper's modus operandi to deflect suspicion from himself, and those who ascribe it to the Ripper.|$|E

5|$|The {{occurrence}} of planktonic foraminifera across the K–Pg boundary {{has been studied}} since the 1930s.

25|$|Neoclassical {{economics}} is also {{often seen as}} relying too heavily on complex mathematical models, such as those used in general equilibrium theory, without enough regard to whether these actually describe the real economy. Many see an attempt to model a system as complex as a modern economy by a mathematical model as unrealistic and doomed to failure. A famous answer to this criticism is Milton Friedman's claim that theories should be judged by their ability to predict events {{rather than by the}} realism of their assumptions. Mathematical models also include those in game theory, linear programming, and econometrics. Some see mathematical models used in contemporary research in mainstream economics as having transcended neoclassical economics, while others disagree. Critics of neoclassical economics are divided into <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>think</b> that highly mathematical method is inherently wrong and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>think</b> that mathematical method is potentially good even if contemporary methods have problems.|$|E
25|$|If {{religious}} {{exercises are}} held to be an impermissible activity in schools, religion is placed in an artificial and state-created disadvantage....

25|$|While mikoshi-nyūdō {{depicted}} as a yōkai with giant characteristics exists, the mikoshi-nyūdō that {{brings to mind the}} long-necked rokurokubi depicted in play images in the Edo period are certainly not strange. There are <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>think</b> that they are related to the rokurokubi, and since the rokurokubi of legends are frequently female, they are sometimes pointed out as examples of male rokurokubi. The length of its neck has been exaggerated over the passage of eras, and in the late Edo period, it has become standard for its neck to be long and thin, and for its face to have three eyes. In many kusazōshi that had a theme on yōkai, they are also {{depicted as}} having a characteristic long neck, and from having an appearance with such impact, they almost always appear as the chief yōkai.|$|E

[...] Raziq Rauf writing for the BBC praised the band for the album's musical diversity with its use of electronic songs like album-opener [...] "The Bitter End" [...] and the band's use of technicality and melody in songs.

500|$|In {{the late}} 4th and early 5th centuries, the work {{received}} a mixed response. Many scholars hold that the theologian, historian, and translator Jerome was {{a critic of}} the work; in a letter written from Bethlehem to Paulinus of Nola castigating Virgilian centos, he warned against following an [...] "old chatterbox" [...] (garrula anus) and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>think</b> of calling [...] "the Christless Maro [...] a Christian" [...] (non ... Maronem sine Christo possimus dicere Christianum). According to the historian James Westfall Thompson, Jerome [...] "strongly inveighed against this method of destroying the sense of a pagan author", and this [...] "his love of the classics and his Christian piety were alike offended" [...] by Proba's actions. Conversely, [...] Roman Emperor Arcadius (who reigned from AD 395–408) received a copy of the poem, and his version has a fifteen-line dedication contending that Proba's work is [...] "Maro changed for the better in a sacred meaning” (Maronem mutatum in melius divino ... sensu). The work was also presented to Aelia Eudocia, the wife of Emperor Theodosius II (who reigned from AD 408–450).|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} first {{broadcast}} in the United States on NBC on Monday, September 21, 1998, in the 9:3010 p.m. (PST) timeslot. In its original American broadcast, the pilot tied with Working for forty-first place in {{ratings for the}} week of September 21–27, 1998. With a Nielsen rating of 8.6, equivalent to approximately 8.4 million viewing households, it was the fifteenth-highest-rated show on NBC the week it aired. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Joyce Millman of Salon Entertainment said the episode has [...] "glimmers of class" [...] and the jokes are [...] "relatively sophisticated". John Carman of the San Francisco Chronicle commented that Burrows's direction was [...] "sharp as usual" [...] and the writing was [...] "above average". Brian Lambert of the St. Paul Pioneer Press said the pilot was [...] "nicely staged by veteran director Jimmy Burrows, and coming from a couple producers, Max Mutchnick and David Cohan, who assisted Boston Common and Dream On, the show – {{which is to say}} the pilot episode (everything could go to hell next week) – has the best verbal interplay of any of the season's new sitcoms." [...] William Horn from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) thought the episode was a [...] "wonderful" [...] representation of a gay man's life [...] "regardless of whether he's in a relationship in that very moment. I think it's important that American audiences realize that lesbians and gay men are not simply all about sexual situations." [...] Ellen Gray of the Chicago Tribune was also positive about the show: [...] "For those who believe that Hollywood's engaging in a conspiracy to 'normalize' a sexual orientation that many Americans still find abhorrent, Will & Grace will look like a candy-coated poison pill. To <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>think</b> that Hollywood isn't moving fast enough in offering sexual parity for gays, it may just look like poison.
