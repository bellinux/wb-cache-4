5|$|Switzerland did {{not possess}} {{biological}} weapons nor chemical weapons, nor did <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> as {{in their interest}} to acquire them. Thus the banning of such weapons was in the country's interest. Switzerland signed the Biological Weapons Convention in April 1972 and ratified the treaty in 1976 with three reservations. The country also signed the Chemical Weapons Convention in January 1993 and ratified it in March 1995.|$|E
5|$|The poem is in {{many ways}} deeply Christian, with {{frequent}} references to the fall of Adam and Eve and to Jesus Christ. Scholars have debated the depth of the Christian elements within the poem by looking at {{it in the context of}} the age in which it was written, coming up with varying views as to what represents a Christian element of the poem and what does not. For example, some critics compare Sir Gawain to the other three poems of the Gawain manuscript. Each has a heavily Christian theme, causing scholars to interpret Gawain similarly. Comparing it to the poem Cleanness (also known as Purity), for example, <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> as a story of the apocalyptic fall of a civilisation, in Gawain's case, Camelot. In this interpretation, Sir Gawain is like Noah, separated from his society and warned by the Green Knight (who is seen as God's representative) of the coming doom of Camelot. Gawain, judged worthy through his test, is spared the doom of the rest of Camelot. King Arthur and his knights, however, misunderstand Gawain's experience and wear garters themselves. In Cleanness the men who are saved are similarly helpless in warning their society of impending destruction.|$|E

25|$|The {{hypothesis}} concludes, more or less, that complex life is rare {{because it}} can evolve only {{on the surface of}} an Earth-like planet or on a suitable satellite of a planet.

25|$|Photographs of {{the dead}} or injured arouse {{controversy}} because more often than not, the name of person depicted in the photograph is not given in the caption. The family of the person is often not informed of the photograph until <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> published. The photograph of the street execution of a suspected Viet Cong soldier during the Vietnam War provoked {{a lot of interest}} because it captured the exact moment of death.

25|$|This play {{portrays a}} family in a ferociously {{negative}} light as the parents and two sons express accusations, blame, and resentments – qualities which are often paired with pathetic and self-defeating attempts at affection, encouragement, tenderness, and yearnings for things to be otherwise. The pain of this family is made worse by their depth of self-understanding and self-analysis, combined with a brutal honesty, as <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> {{and an ability to}} boldly express themselves. The story deals with the mother’s addiction to morphine, the family’s addiction to whiskey, the father’s miserliness, the older brother’s licentiousness, and younger brother’s illness.|$|E

25|$|A scrum {{is formed}} by the eight {{forwards}} from each team binding together in three rows. The front row consists of the two props (loosehead and tighthead) {{either side of the}} hooker. The second row consists of two locks and the two flankers. Behind the second row is the number 8. This formation is known as the 3–4–1 formation. The two packs of forwards engage with each other so that the heads of the front-rowers are interlocked with those of their opponents. Front-rowers always aim for the gap to the left (as <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>it)</b> of their opponent. The two locks in the second row bind directly behind the front row with their heads between a prop and the hooker. The flankers bind either side of the locks, and the number 8 binds behind and between the two locks.|$|E
25|$|Whilst some Australians {{view the}} Eureka Flag {{as a symbol}} of {{nationality}} (see Australian flag debate), it is more often employed by historical societies and re-enactors and by political radicals as a general purpose symbol of protest {{for a wide variety of}} anti-establishment non-conformist causes. The flag has been used {{as a symbol of}} rebellion by groups on both sides of the political spectrum, from left-wing trade unions such as the CFMEU and ETU to white nationalist group National Action and other neo-Nazis, who began to use it in the 1980s. Depending on their political persuasion, <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> as representative of the efforts of the miners to free themselves from political or economic oppression, and by white supremacists at flashpoints for racial confrontation. Along these lines, some also believe that the flag used during the Lambing Flat riots was a derivative of the Eureka Flag.|$|E
25|$|A {{study by}} Peter Kuppens (2008) showed that extraverts and introverts engage in {{different}} behaviors when feeling pleasant, {{which may explain}} underestimation of the frequency and intensity of happiness exhibited by introverts. Specifically, Kuppens (2008) found that arousal and pleasantness are positively correlated for extraverts, which means that pleasant feelings {{are more likely to}} be accompanied by high arousal for extraverts. On the other hand, arousal and pleasantness are negatively correlated for introverts, resulting in introverts exhibiting low arousal when feeling pleasant. In other words, if everything is going well in an extravert's life, which is a source of pleasant feelings, extraverts see such situation as an opportunity to engage in active behavior and goal pursuit, which brings about an active, aroused pleasant state. When everything is going well for introverts, <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> as an opportunity to let down their guard, resulting in them feeling relaxed and content.|$|E

25|$|The Menorah is also lit in synagogue between Minchah and Maariv prayers, {{with the}} blessings, to {{publicize}} the miracle. However, it {{also must be}} lit at home, and even the one who recited the blessings in the synagogue must recite the blessings again at home. For this reason, some congregations, particularly in certain Hasidic communities, have a custom to throw things, such as towels, at whoever lights the menorah in synagogue, {{to show that he}} must light again at home. But when a Rebbe lights in the synagogue before eating a meal there with the congregation, no towels are thrown. Some people disagree with the custom of throwing towels, as <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> as disrespectful to the synagogue, but it was the practice among many Hasidic masters. The Menorah is also lit in the daytime in synagogue during the Shacharith prayers, but no blessings are recited, and towels are not thrown.|$|E
500|$|In January 2009, Jill Berry, {{president}} of the Girls' Schools Association and head teacher at the Dame Alice Harpur School in Bedford, cited medical dramas such as Holby City as an inspiring force in increasing numbers of female students deciding to pursue careers in medicine. Berry explained: [...] "The girls see that as an exciting and dynamic way of life. <b>They</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> as making a difference to people's lives. It gives them a sense sometimes of the pressures, responsibility and adrenaline. Such TV programmes can be good, {{as long as they}} give a realistic impression." [...] Similarly, consultant surgeon Andrew Raftery uses clips from Holby City as part of the University of Sheffield Outreach and Access to Medicine Scheme, to inspire pupils from under-represented social and educational backgrounds to pursue careers in medicine.|$|E

He informed a journalist that [...] "I realize that gay people have put me on a pedestal and I love it. After all, of all the oppressed minorities, they just have to be the most oppressed. They have all the hassles of finding something or someone to identify with [...] and they chose me. I like being around gay people and they've proven to be some of my closest friends and most loyal audiences." [...] Elsewhere, he nevertheless remarked that he felt his career had [...] "transcended the gay movement. I mean, my sexuality has nothing to do with my music. When I'm fucking I'm not thinking about singing and vice versa." [...] He was openly critical of what he perceived as divisive tendencies within the gay community itself, noting that [...] "I get this conformist shit from queens all the time. They always want to read me. They always want me to do it their way. I am not going to conform to the gay lifestyle as <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> and that's for sure". He was particularly critical of [...] "clones" [...] gay men who dressed alike with boots, boot-cut jeans, checked shirts and handlebar mustaches [...] stating that all too often they judged those gay people who were flamboyant or extravagant.|$|E

[...] Karen Kopelson concludes [...] "that many if not most students come to the university in order to gain access to and eventual enfranchisement in 'the establishment,' not to critique and reject its privileges."
