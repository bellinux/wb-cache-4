5|$|By early July 1724 Bach {{was more}} than a month into his second year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. BWV10 is the fifth of 40 chorale cantatas he started that year. The outer {{movements}} of the cantata are set for mixed choir and an orchestra consisting of trumpet, two oboes, strings and continuo. Luther's translation of Luke1:46–48 is <b>the</b> <b>text</b> of the first movement. The canticle's doxology is <b>the</b> <b>text</b> of the last movement. The five middle movements are a succession of arias and recitatives, with, between the fourth and sixth movement, a duet for alto and tenor. Soprano and bass each have one aria, and the two recitatives are sung by the tenor. <b>The</b> <b>text</b> of the arias and recitatives is paraphrased and expanded from Luke1:49–53 and 55. <b>The</b> <b>text</b> of the duet is Luther's translation of Luke1:54.

This approach to <b>the</b> <b>texts</b> of <b>the</b> journal helps to reveal in the first place a sociological code of the notion under study. The Hermeneutical procedure allows to specify its most important topical complexes. It is determined that the «primary unit», which most efficiently provides transdimensional textual space in the journal editions, is the symbol, and it urges activity on generating meanings in <b>the</b> literary <b>texts</b> in «Sovremennye zapiski» by correlation with the meanings of <b>the</b> <b>texts</b> of other discourses.

In the frame of literary reception the data is studied to explain the relation between <b>the</b> <b>texts</b> of hypogram and the novel.
