25|$|Ionospheric {{delay of}} a {{microwave}} signal {{depends on its}} frequency. It arises from ionized atmosphere (see <b>Total</b> <b>electron</b> <b>content).</b> This phenomenon is known as dispersion and can be calculated from measurements of delays for two or more frequency bands, allowing delays at other frequencies to be estimated. Some military and expensive survey-grade civilian receivers calculate atmospheric dispersion from the different delays in the L1 and L2 frequencies, and apply a more precise correction. This {{can be done in}} civilian receivers without decrypting the P(Y) signal carried on L2, by tracking the carrier wave instead of the modulated code. To facilitate this on lower cost receivers, a new civilian code signal on L2, called L2C, was added to the Block IIR-M satellites, which was first launched in 2005. It allows a direct comparison of the L1 and L2 signals using the coded signal instead of the carrier wave.|$|E

The simulation results show that in the expansion phase, structured precipitation and channeled field-aligned currents quickly develop in the substorm onset region. The Hall and Pedersen conductance ratio in the region increases significantly, and the magnetospheric field-aligned currents are mainly closed by highly structured Hall currents. Correspondingly, the plasma in the ionosphere also undergoes significant changes during a substorm and is highly structured in both the horizontal and vertical directions. In the substorm onset region, there are spatially separated small-scale Ti and Te hot spots, downward ExB drifts, decreased <b>total</b> <b>electron</b> <b>contents,</b> and a lowered ionosphere.

The correlation between the [O/N 2] ratio estimated using the NRLMSISE- 00 atmospheric model and the TEC winter anomaly is also investigated. The numerical {{results show that the}} TEC winter anomaly in different regions of the world tends to be dominated by different factors. In North America, the TEC winter anomaly is strongly affected by the magnetospheric processes in high latitudes and the [O/N 2] ratio. In the Euro-Africa and Russia-Asia regions, the TEC winter anomaly depends mainly on the [O/N 2] ratio at the latitude band of 30 °– 60 °N, and the extent of the TEC winter anomaly gradually decreases from 60 °N to 30 °N. The extent of the TEC winter anomaly increases at the latitude band of 15 °– 30 °N due to the influence of the meridional neutral wind and the seasonal changes of the subsolar point. However, the TEC winter anomaly was not observed in southern hemisphere in 2002. The TEC equinoctial asymmetries in the northern and southern hemisphere are also presented using GPS TEC values collected in March and September 2002.|$|R

To investigate suitable approaches to improve ionospheric modeling towards a real-time CM-level positioning using the Victorian continuously operating reference stations network (i. e.

This complex nature of the ionosphere suggests that it is a challenging task to precisely represent the behaviours of the ionosphere if only a single and simple ionospheric model is used for all the time for RTK uses. It is therefore, necessary to develop new mathematical models or new procedures for precise representation of the ionospheric TEC variations in Victoria using a long period of GPS dual frequency observations, particularly the predictability of the ionosphere changes.

These sun activities can be represented by the magnetic indexes of the geomagnetic activities (A p, K p), which are continuously obtained by geophysics observatories.

Based on this result one may monitor the magnetic storms, which are caused by the different solar activities by simply monitoring the TEC using the GPS measurements. Although the GPS permanent stations IGS network does not cover all world regions, like North Africa and other regions in Asia and southern America, any other station not far away than 2000 km from a IGS permanent one can be used.

However, the DCB values for all GPS satellites are presumably known from IGS GIM or other GIMs. The DCBs of the IGS GIMs are a combined solution from the following analysis centers (ACs): the Centre for Orbit Determination in Europe (CODE) in Switzerland, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in the USA, the European Space Agency (ESA) in Germany, and the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC) in Spain.

40|$|Abstract: When RF waves {{pass through}} the solar corona and solar wind regions close to the Sun, strong {{scintillation}} effects appear at their amplitude, frequency and phase, especially in the regions {{very close to the}} Sun (less than 4 solar radius). After analyzing recent solar corona conjunction experimental data at S, X and Ka bands, we have developed a group of empirical equations to describe these effects on telecommunication links over microwave frequency ranges. There are mainly three types of degradation effects on RF signals: (1) Intensity scintillation (rapid signal amplitude changes due to propagation path changes and phase shifting scattered by corona turbulence) (2) Phase scintillation (signal frequency fluctuations due to rapid phase changes through solar corona turbulence) (3) Spectral broadening (Doppler shifting of RF signals scattered by moving plasma irregularities). We find that all of three degradation quantities may be represented in a simplified form: α f β RTECγ where α, β, and γ are three constants with different values for different quantities, f is RF signal frequency, while RTEC (radial <b>total</b> <b>electron</b> <b>contents)</b> is an integration of plasma density along the radial direction starting from the ray path’s closest distance from the Sun to infinity.
