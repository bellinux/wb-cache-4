Architectural opinion had turned heavily against Victorian styles and Chelsea Bridge was now deeply unpopular with architects; former President of the Royal Institute of British Architects Reginald Blomfield spoke vehemently against its design in 1921, and there were few people supporting the preservation of the old bridge. In 1926 the Royal Commission on Cross-river Traffic recommended that Chelsea Bridge be rebuilt or replaced.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} part of the twentieth century, Slipher, Hubble and others made the first {{measurements}} of the redshifts and blueshifts of galaxies beyond the Milky Way. They initially interpreted these redshifts and blueshifts as due to random motions, but later Hubble discovered a rough correlation between <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> redshifts and <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> distance of galaxies. Theorists almost immediately realized that these observations could be explained by a mechanism for producing redshifts seen in certain cosmological solutions to Einstein's equations of general relativity. Hubble's law of the correlation between redshifts and distances is required by all such models that have a metric expansion of space. As a result, the wavelength of photons propagating through the expanding space is stretched, creating the cosmological redshift.|$|E

30|$|Effectiveness {{of these}} derives from <b>the</b> <b>increased</b> camber of <b>the</b> airfoil section. High camber <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> maximum lift coefficient.

In fact, because of <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in circulation around <b>the</b> wing, <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in upwash at the leading edge makes the flow separate more easily and reducing the separation angle. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in airfoil camber causes an increase in drag at low angles of attack, worsening the L/D ratio.|$|R
