5|$|On 10 June a patrol—designated Operation Faun Fare—consisting of 7 Platoon, C Company under Lieutenant Robert Guest, {{accompanied}} the company commander Major Ivor Hodgkinson, the Intelligence Officer and a fire control party, {{left the company}} base at Serikin to mount an ambush on the Sungei Koemba river. The site of the ambush was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> further downstream from the successful action the previous month, being more towards the Indonesian positions at Siding. The Australian patrol occupied its intended ambush position {{early the next morning}} and proceeded to wait. During the day two boats occupied by civilians were observed and allowed to pass unhindered, as were three more the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Sailor Brian Hancock {{encountered}} Hurricane Lili {{during the}} Route of Discovery yacht race from Benalmádena, Spain to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.Tropical Storm Lili was traveling at around 18 knots {{along the same}} path as the race fleet and was starting to pick off the slower boats. Astern of us we were getting reports of gale force winds, ripped sails and some damage all the while Lili gained in strength. By our calculation we would get to the Bahamas before the storm did, but {{the problem was that}} the Bahamas were not our final destination. We had to round San Salvador and then sail just under 500 miles back toward the east, well southeast to be exact. We rounded San Salvador and sailed slap bang into the teeth of a ferocious storm. Hurricane Lili was packing around 70 to 80 knots of wind and we hove to to ride it out. I remember feeling exhilarated by it all. It helps <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> naive and dumb but that’s how you are when you are in your 20’s.|$|E

Later in 2006, Obie Trice {{released}} his second album, Second Round's on Me. However, the album did not fare as well commercially as his debut, seemingly because {{of the state of the}} hip-hop industry. The album saw a change in Obie Trice's style, whose first album was considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> light-hearted. Second Round's on Me was considered to be a more serious, dark album, mainly showing the grittiness of Obie Trice's life and surroundings.|$|E

25|$|Mayall starred {{alongside}} Phoebe Cates in Drop Dead Fred (1991) as the eponymous character, a troublesome imaginary {{friend who}} reappears from a woman's childhood. He {{also appeared in}} Carry On Columbus (1992) with other alternative comedians. Mayall also provided {{the voice of the}} character Froglip, the prince of the goblins, in the 1992 animated film adaption of the 1872 children's tale The Princess and the Goblin by George MacDonald. In 1993, he appeared in Rik Mayall Presents, six individual comedy dramas (Micky Love / Briefest Encounter / Dancing Queen / The Big One / Dirty Old Town / Clair de Lune). Mayall's performances won him a Best Comedy Performer award at that year's British Comedy Awards, and a second series of three was broadcast in early 1995. He provided the voice for Little Sod in Simon Brett's How <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> Sod, written in 1991 and adapted as ten consecutive episodes broadcast by the BBC in 1995. In the early 1990s, he auditioned for the roles of Banzai, Zazu and Timon in The Lion King (1994); he was asked to audition by lyricist Tim Rice, but the role of Zazu finally went to Rowan Atkinson.|$|E

50|$|Ideally, {{the loop}} gain needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bigger than one, but in practice, {{it is often}} {{significantly}} greater than one. A larger loop gain makes the oscillator start quickly. A large loop gain also compensates for gain variations with temperature and the desired frequency of a tunable oscillator. For the oscillator to start, the loop gain must be greater than one under all possible conditions.|$|R
25|$|Some {{art historians}} once {{identified}} {{the child as}} a young Cosimo I de' Medici, but it is now generally accepted to be Giulia. The child in the portrait appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl, rather than a boy, and her expression is anxious. Maria Salviati, who is dressed soberly as befitted a widow, is seen sheltering the vulnerable child against her side. Art historian Gabrielle Langdon argues that the girl's demeanor in the portrait is different than would have been expected for the child Cosimo, whose family anticipated {{his role as a}} strong leader from his earliest days. It would have been to Cosimo I's advantage to commission a portrait depicting his mother as an exemplary widow, affectionately bringing up the orphaned daughter of Cosimo I's predecessor. The child's full lips, round nose, and curly reddish hair also bear little resemblance to known portraits of Cosimo as a child, though they do to portraits of the young Alessandro. Other girls of about the right age who were at court during this period also do not resemble the child in the portrait. The portrait might {{be one of the first}} in Renaissance-era Europe of a girl of presumed African and European ancestry. This painting is in the permanent collection of The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland.|$|E
25|$|On 1 April 1978, {{he started}} an ambitious tour of SFR Yugoslavia with Lokice dance group {{in support of}} the album that had already sold 150,000 copies. Čolić also started to play the guitar {{occasionally}} on stage. Putujući zemljotres (Traveling Earthquake Tour) produced and organized by Maksa Ćatović moved all over the country, soon becoming a phenomenon the likes of which the country had not seen before. The scenes of screaming girls rushing the stage were repeated in city after city. The tour's climax took place in Belgrade at Red Star FC stadium on 5 September 1978 with 70,000 people in attendance despite the fact that Čolić already played two sold out shows in Belgrade a few months earlier on 4 and 8 April at Hala Pionir. Supporting Čolić on stage that night were Chris Nicholls on keyboards and Dado Topić on bass guitar with old favourites Kornelije Kovač, Arsen Dedić, Kemal Monteno, Josip Boček, Trio Strune and RTV Belgrade singing quintet appearing as guests. Čolić and the massive tour essentially became a cultural phenomenon transcending musical boundaries such that in the lead up to the big Belgrade concert journalist Dušan Savković and film director Jovan Ristić decided to make a movie about Čolić. Savković wrote a rudimentary screenplay, but the movie ended up being a 90-minute feature documentary titled Pjevam danju, pjevam noću that follows Čolić from Belgrade concert onwards and looks back on his career up to that point. Two days after the Belgrade concert, Čolić was in his hometown Sarajevo at Koševo Stadium for the tour's grand finale, however the rain interrupted much of the concert and the whole thing turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> anticlimactic. By the end of its promotion cycle, the album sold more than 700,000 copies and with later re-releases during the 1990s went over the million mark.|$|E
