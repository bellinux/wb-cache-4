60|$|Numerous cases {{could be}} given of {{striking}} resemblances in quite distinct beings between single parts or organs, which have been adapted for the same functions. A good instance is afforded by the close resemblance of the jaws of the dog and <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>wolf</b> or Thylacinus--animals which are widely sundered in the natural system. But this resemblance is confined to general appearance, as in the prominence of the canines, and in the cutting shape of the molar teeth. For the teeth really differ much: thus the dog has {{on each side of}} the upper jaw four pre-molars and only two molars; while the Thylacinus has three pre-molars and four molars. The molars also differ much in the two animals in relative size and structure. The adult dentition is preceded by a widely different milk dentition. Any one may, of course, deny that the teeth in either case have been adapted for tearing flesh, through the natural selection of successive variations; but if this be admitted in the one case, it is unintelligible to me that it should be denied in the other. I am glad to find that so high an authority as Professor Flower has come to this same conclusion.|$|E
40|$|In the {{helminth}} {{collection in}} the Department of Parasitology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, there is a vial (specimen No. 2468) containing four female ascaridoid nematodes and labelled <b>Tasmanian</b> Marsupial <b>Wolf.</b> As the thylacine wolf has not been sighted since 1933 and may be extinct, these specimens have particular interest. They were examined by the writer by permission of Professor J. J. C. Buckley. Unfortunately there were no male specimens {{and in spite of}} widespread enquiries to museums in Europe, the United States of America and Australia, no further specimens have been found. Apart from a cestode larva recorded by Ransom (1907) these nematodes appear to be the only parasites ever recorded from this host. The preserved stomach and intestines of four thylacines were examined by the writer by permission of Dr E. H. Hipsley of the Australian Institute of Anatomy at Canberra, but no ascaridoids were found. As the thylacine is evidently on the verge of extinction, and the ascaridoids collected from this host manifested certain features which are hitherto unknown among ascaridoids, the writer considered the specimens should be described, in spite of there being no male. Furthermore, there appeared to be no alternative but to propose a new genus...|$|R

50|$|Thylacinus is a genus of extinct {{carnivorous}} marsupials {{from the}} order Dasyuromorphia. The only recent member was the thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus), {{commonly known as}} the Tasmanian tiger or <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>wolf,</b> which became extinct in 1936 due to hunting. The other animals in the group all lived in prehistoric times in Australia. An unidentified species of the genus is known from the Pleistocene of New Guinea.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{carnivorous}} marsupials have carnassial teeth. Both the living Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) and the recently extinct <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>wolf</b> (Thylacinus cynocephalus) possessed modified molars {{to allow for}} shearing, although the <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>wolf,</b> {{the larger of the}} two, had adaptation more similar to the modern dog. The Pleistocene marsupial lion (Thylacoleo carnifex) had massive carnassial molars. A recent study concludes that these teeth produced the strongest bite of any mammal in history. Moreover, these carnassial molars appear to have been used, unlike in any other known mammal, to inflict the killing blow to the prey by severing the spinal cord, crushing the windpipe or severing a major artery. Like these true marsupials, the closely related borhyaenids of South America had three carnassial teeth involving the first three upper molars (M1-M3) and the second through fourth lower molars (m2-m4). In the borhyaenids the upper carnassials appear to have been rotated medially around the anteriorposterior axis of the tooth row in order to maintain tight occlusional contact between the upper and lower shearing teeth.|$|E
5000|$|The {{thylacine}} ( [...] , or [...] , alsobinomial name: Thylacinus cynocephalus, Greek for [...] "dog-headed pouched one") was {{the largest}} known carnivorous marsupial of modern times. It {{is commonly known as}} the Tasmanian tiger (because of its striped lower back) or the <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>wolf.</b> Native to continental Australia, Tasmania and New Guinea, it is believed to have become extinct in the 20th century. It was the last extant member of its family, Thylacinidae; specimens of other members of the family have been found in the fossil record dating back to the late Oligocene.|$|E
50|$|The {{plight of}} the {{thylacine}} was featured in a campaign for The Wilderness Society entitled We used to hunt thylacines. In video games, boomerang-wielding Ty the Tasmanian Tiger is the star of his own trilogy. Characters in the early 1990s cartoon Taz-Mania included the neurotic Wendell T. Wolf, the last surviving <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>wolf.</b> Tiger Tale is a children's book based on an Aboriginal myth about how the thylacine got its stripes. The thylacine character Rolf is featured in the extinction musical Rockford's Rock Opera. The thylacine is the mascot for the Tasmanian cricket team, and has appeared in postage stamps from Australia, Equatorial Guinea, and Micronesia.|$|E
5000|$|They {{pretend that}} the <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>wolf,</b> a marsupial, {{would be placed}} {{classified}} with the placental wolf if evolutionists were not so hung up on the single character of their reproductive mode by which marsupials and placentals are traditionally separated. This is a complete falsehood, as anyone {{with access to the}} evidence knows. It {{is not a matter of}} a single reproductive character, but dozens of characters in the skull, teeth, post-cranial bones (including the marsupial pelvic bones), soft anatomy, and biochemistry, to say nothing of their respective fossil records, that separate the two mammals. About the closest similarity they have going for them is that they are both called [...] "wolf" [...] in English. The same criticism can be applied seriatim to the authors' mystifying discussion of the red and giant [...] "pandas".|$|E
50|$|It is now {{commonly}} {{believed that}} the Girt Dog of Ennerdale was, in fact, a thylacine (otherwise known as the Tasmanian tiger or <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>wolf.)</b> Travelling circuses and menageries of the time were known to contain what were described as “tiger wolves” - a description that fits the thylacine perfectly. As import laws and animal control were so relaxed {{in the early part}} of the nineteenth century, an escape from one of these itinerant shows is easy to imagine. These creatures, a native of Tasmania (Australasia), were also known to prefer the softer organs of its kills and also had a fondness for drinking blood. And of course, the thylacine also had the distinctive dark stripes, running from its shoulders down to its tail. Officially, the last known thylacine died in captivity in 1936, although even to this day there are reported sightings of these creatures in the Tasmanian wilderness.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{examples}} of parallel evolution are provided by the two main branches of the mammals, the placentals and marsupials, which have followed independent evolutionary pathways following the break-up of land-masses such as Gondwanaland roughly 100 million years ago. In South America, marsupials and placentals shared the ecosystem (prior to the Great American Interchange); in Australia, marsupials prevailed; and in the Old World and North America the placentals won out. However, in all these localities mammals were small and filled only limited places in the ecosystem until the mass extinction of dinosaurs sixty-five million years ago. At this time, mammals on all three landmasses began {{to take on a}} much wider variety of forms and roles. While some forms were unique to each environment, surprisingly similar animals have often emerged in two or three of the separated continents. Examples of these include the placental sabre-toothed cats (Machairodontinae) and the South American marsupial sabre-tooth (Thylacosmilus); the <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>wolf</b> and the European wolf; likewise marsupial and placental moles, flying squirrels, and (arguably) mice.|$|E
50|$|Caughley {{continued}} his {{education at the}} University of Sydney (1960-1963) with his advisors Charles Birch (insect population ecologist) and Harry Frith (ornithologist). Frith was chief of the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and Caughley used the CSIRO sheep station to study the ecology of kangaroos. Caughley found that kangaroo groups are formed by a random process of members coming and leaving, which was in contrast {{to what he had}} seen in red deer. He interpreted this to mean that random grouping was density dependent with increased grouping at higher densities. An approximation of density could then be found by taking the average number of individuals per group in a given area. Continuing his research he found that red kangaroos are much more drought-tolerant than grey kangaroos, which visit water three times more often. In addition he showed that grey kangaroos prefer areas of higher ground cover than do red kangaroos and that this may be a behavioural relic from when the <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>wolf</b> and Tasmanian devil overlapped in habitat with the kangaroo.|$|E
5000|$|The Thylacine is {{commonly}} known as the Tasmanian tiger (because of its striped lower back) or the <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>wolf.</b> Native to continental Australia, Tasmania and New Guinea, it is believed to have become extinct in the 20th century. The thylacine had become extremely rare or extinct on the Australian mainland before British settlement of the continent, but it survived on the island of Tasmania along with several other endemic species, including the Tasmanian devil. Intensive hunting encouraged by bounties is generally blamed for its extinction, but other contributing factors may have been disease, the introduction of dogs, and human encroachment into its habitat. Despite its official classification as extinct, sightings are still reported, though none has been conclusively proven. The last known thylacine died at Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart, Tasmania, on 7 September 1936. It is believed to have died as the result of neglect—locked out of its sheltered sleeping quarters, it was exposed to a rare occurrence of extreme Tasmanian weather: extreme heat during the day and freezing temperatures at night. [...] National Threatened Species Day has been held annually since 1996 on 7 September in Australia, to commemorate the death of the last officially recorded thylacine. Although there had been a conservation movement pressing for the thylacine's protection since 1901, driven in part by the increasing difficulty in obtaining specimens for overseas collections, political difficulties prevented any form of protection coming into force until 1936. Official protection of the species by the Tasmanian government was introduced on 10 July 1936, 59 days before the last known specimen died in captivity. The thylacine held the status of endangered species until the 1980s. International standards at the time stated that an animal could not be declared extinct until 50 years had passed without a confirmed record. Since no definitive proof of the thylacine's existence in the wild had been obtained for more than 50 years, it met that official criterion and was declared extinct by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in 1982 and by the Tasmanian government in 1986. The species was removed from Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in 2013.|$|E

40|$|For {{most people}} {{interested}} in zoology the finding {{of a new and}} unknown species must rank among the most exciting of discoveries that they can hope to make. Rediscovering a long lost species must be a close second. Think for a moment about the excitement that would be caused by capturing a living, breathing <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>Wolf,</b> the thrill of observing an elusive male Pink-headed Duck making his way through a dense Burmese swamp or the headlines that you would generate by being the first person to clap eyes on a Steller´s Sea Cow in more than two hundred and fifty years.

40|$|It {{has been}} evolved alike in many {{unrelated}} groups of animals by the hunter and the hunted; {{in the sea}} and on land. It tones the canvas on which are painted the Leopard's spots, the Tiger's stripes, and the patterns of smaller Carnivora such as Serval and Ocelot, Civet, and Genet, Jackal and Hyaena. It is the dress almost universally worn by rodents, including the Vizcacha, Jerboas, Gerbils, Cavies, Agouties, Hares, and many other. It is the essential uniform adopted by Conies, Asses, Antelopes, Deer, and other groups of ungulates. It is repeated extensively among the marsupials, {{as seen in the}} coloration of the <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>wolf,</b> Opossums, Wallabies and others. It forms the background to reveal the beautiful subtle picture patterns worn by Wheatears, Warblers, Pipits, Woodcock, Bustards, and innumerable other birds. It provides a basic livery for the great majority of snakes, lizards, and amphibians. Among insects it reaches a fine state of perfection in different caterpillars and grasshoppers. Hugh Cott (1940) In 1896 American artist and naturalist Abbott Handerson Thayer published an article in The Auk entitled ‘The law which underlies protective coloration’. In this article he observed that ‘animals are painted by nature darkest on those parts which tend to be most lighted by the sky's light, and vice versa’. As an example, Thayer described the plumage of the ruffed grouse, whose feathers are dark brown on the back and blend gradually into white on the underneath. Such a gradation in shading, Thayer hypothesised, made three-dimensional bodies appear less round and less solid by balancing and neutralising the effects of illumination by the sun. Thayer called this type of patterning obliterative shading, which today we term countershading...|$|E
