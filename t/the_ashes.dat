40|$|During April and May 2010 <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> cloud from <b>the</b> {{eruption}} of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull caused widespread disruption to aviation over northern Europe. Because {{of the location}} and impact of the eruption a wealth of observations of <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> cloud were obtained {{and can be used}} to assess modelling of the long range transport of <b>ash</b> in <b>the</b> troposphere. The UK's BAe- 146 - 301 Atmospheric Research Aircraft overflew <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> cloud on a number of days during May. The aircraft carries a downward looking lidar which detected <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> layer through <b>the</b> backscatter of the laser light. <b>The</b> <b>ash</b> concentrations are estimated from lidar extinction coefficients and in situ measurements of <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> particle size distributions. In this study these estimates of <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> concentrations are compared with simulations of <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> cloud made with NAME (Numerical Atmospheric-dispersion Modelling Environment), a general purpose atmospheric transport and dispersion model. <b>The</b> <b>ash</b> layers seen by the lidar were thin, with typical depths of 550 – 750 m. The vertical structure of <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> cloud simulated by NAME was generally consistent with <b>the</b> observed <b>ash</b> layers. <b>The</b> layers in <b>the</b> simulated <b>ash</b> clouds that could be identified with observed ash layers are about twice the depth of the observed layers. The structure of <b>the</b> simulated <b>ash</b> clouds were sensitive to <b>the</b> profile of <b>ash</b> emissions that was assumed. In terms of horizontal and vertical structure the best results were mainly obtained by assuming that the emission occurred {{at the top of the}} eruption plume, consistent with the observed structure of eruption plumes. However, when the height of the eruption plume was variable and the eruption was weak, then assuming that <b>the</b> emission of <b>ash</b> was uniform with height gave better guidance on the horizontal and vertical structure of <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> cloud. Comparison between the column masses in the simulated and observed ash layers suggests that about 3 % of the total mass erupted by the volcano remained in <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> cloud over <b>the</b> United Kingdom.

5|$|Generally, {{given that}} <b>the</b> way {{airborne}} <b>ash</b> is deposited after an eruption is {{strongly influenced by}} the meteorological conditions, a certain variation of <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> type will occur, {{as a function of}} distance to the volcano or time elapsed from eruption. <b>The</b> <b>ash</b> from Mount St. Helens is no exception, and hence <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> properties have large variations.|$|R

40|$|The Eyjafjallajokull volcano in Iceland erupted explosively on 14 April 2010, {{emitting}} a {{plume of}} <b>ash</b> into <b>the</b> atmosphere. <b>The</b> <b>ash</b> was transported from Iceland toward Europe where mostly cloud-free skies allowed ground-based lidars at Chilbolton in England and Leipzig in Germany to estimate the mass concentration in <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> cloud as it passed overhead. The UK Met Office's Numerical Atmospheric-dispersion Modeling Environment (NAME) {{has been used to}} simulate the evolution of <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> cloud from <b>the</b> Eyjafjallajokull volcano during the initial phase of <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> emissions, 14 - 16 April 2010. NAME captures the timing and sloped structure of <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> layer observed over Leipzig, close to the central axis of <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> cloud. Relatively small errors in <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> cloud position, probably caused by the cumulative effect of errors in the driving meteorology en route, result in a timing error at distances far from the central axis of <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> cloud. Taking <b>the</b> timing error into account, NAME is able to capture <b>the</b> sloped <b>ash</b> layer over <b>the</b> UK. Comparison of the lidar observations and NAME simulations has allowed an estimation of the plume height time series to be made. It is necessary to include in the model input the large variations in plume height in order to accurately predict <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> cloud structure at long range. Quantitative comparison with the mass concentrations at Leipzig and Chilbolton suggest that around 3 % of the total emitted mass is transported as far as these sites by small (< 100 mu m diameter) ash particles.
