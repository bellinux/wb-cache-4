Clarke provided two of the team's highest finishes in the later-season single day races, coming fifth at the Coppa Ugo Agostoni and seventh at Vattenfall Cyclassics. Clarke also <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good ride at the Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec, finishing tenth.|$|E
5|$|Max Allan Collins, who {{authored}} {{the graphic}} novel, {{was hired to}} write the novelization for the film adaptation. Collins initially <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> draft that contained 90,000 words, but the licensing at DreamWorks required the author to use only the dialogue from the film and no additional dialogue. Collins reluctantly edited the novelization down to 50,000 words and later said he regretted taking on the task.|$|E
5|$|After facing {{criticism}} {{for a lack}} of production in the first two weeks, Smith <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> record-setting performance against the St. Louis Rams in Week 3. In the first quarter, he scored on each of his first three career receptions with 74-, 41-, and 18-yard touchdowns. The 74-yard score was the longest completion of quarterback Joe Flacco's career. He became the first NFL rookie, and only the twelfth player, to amass three touchdown receptions in a single quarter. Smith finished the game with five receptions for 152yards in the 37–7 victory. It remains a Ravens rookie record, as does Smith's 30.4 yards per catch that day.|$|E

5|$|By July 2000, {{the film}} was being written for New Line by Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, and Tim McCanlies. McCanlies' script used {{the idea of a}} Nick Fury cameo to set up his own film. In June 2001, New Line entered talks with Joss Whedon, a fan of the character, to direct, and in December 2002, McCanlies had <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{completed}} script. In December 2004, the studio attached director Nick Cassavetes to the project for a target 2006 release. Screenplay drafts were written by Alfred Gough, Miles Millar, and David Hayter, and pitted Iron Man against his father Howard Stark, who becomes War Machine. After two years of unsuccessful development, and the deal with Cassavetes falling through, New Line Cinema returned the film rights to Marvel.|$|E
5|$|Liam Brady was {{struggling}} as Celtic manager in September 1992, but enjoyed a brief respite {{in the first}} round of the UEFA Cup. Celtic recovered from a 2–0 first leg defeat away at Cologne in the UEFA Cup to win the return match in Glasgow 3–0, midfielder John Collins scoring the decisive third goal seven minutes from time. Celtic were drawn against another German side in the next round, Borussia Dortmund. In the first leg away in Dortmund, Celtic <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good performance; Paul McStay and John Collins constantly troubled the Dortmund defence. Celtic came close to scoring after hitting the crossbar, and were unlucky to lose 1–0. Gerry Creaney levelled the tie on aggregate with a first half goal in Glasgow. Dortmund, however, took control in the second half, scored twice and sent Celtic out 3–1 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|Riegels did play, and he <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> stellar {{second half}} performance, {{including}} blocking a Tech punt. In addition, Lom passed {{for a touchdown}} and kicked the extra point, {{but that was not}} enough. Tech would ultimately win the game and their second national championship 8–7. Georgia Tech's safety score after the wrong way run made the difference in the outcome of the game, which increased the significance of Roy's mistake. In spite of the loss, the example of how the distraught Riegels was persuaded to pick himself up, return to the field and play so hard during the second half is sometimes used by motivational speakers to illustrate overcoming setbacks.|$|E

5|$|The game {{begins in}} the Arizona Territory in 1876 with Jericho {{attempting}} to rob a Darkwatch train that is transporting the captured Lazarus Malkoth to the Darkwatch Citadel, a frequently mentioned and often visited location in the game. His actions inadvertently release Lazarus into the West. In a seeming bit of mercy, Lazarus bites Jericho and gives him {{the curse of the}} vampire, causing him to slowly turn into one. The game continues with the introduction of Darkwatch agent Cassidy Sharp as well as the appearance of Shadow, Jericho's undead horse whom he fed on and <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> frenzy after being bitten by Lazarus.|$|E
5|$|The idea to do a film {{adaptation}} of Susan Orlean's The Orchid Thief {{dates back to}} 1994. Fox 2000 purchased the film rights in 1997, eventually selling them to Jonathan Demme, who set the project at Columbia Pictures. Charlie Kaufman was hired to write the script, but struggled with the adaptation and writer's block. Kaufman eventually created a script of his experience in adaptation, exaggerating events, and creating a fictional brother named Donald Kaufman. Kaufman put Donald Kaufman's name on the script and dedicated the film to the fictional character. By September 1999, Kaufman had written two drafts of the script; he <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> third draft in November 2000.|$|E
5|$|The {{team had}} a solid showing at the {{traditional}} opener to the French cycling season, the Grand Prix d'Ouverture La Marseillaise. While 's Jérémy Roy easily won the race with a solo breakaway, Gautier rode to sixth place by finishing {{near the front of}} the peloton two and a half minutes behind. At Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne, one of the early-season Belgian races, Chavanel also <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sixth place, in a large field sprint. That same day, Gautier secured a podium finish at Les Boucles du Sud Ardèche, coming third in a selective 12-rider sprint {{at the front of the}} race. Chavanel rode to eighth place at Le Samyn, coming across the line 11 seconds back of the winner Dominic Klemme in a race decided by a late breakaway.|$|E

5|$|A {{knee injury}} saw Forster miss most of 2015, but his form on {{returning}} to playing football in early 2016 {{earned him a}} recall to the England squad in March. He played {{the second half of}} England's 3–2 friendly win over Germany in Berlin, making an impressive save from a Marco Reus free kick, although later conceded a goal from a Mario Gómez header. Forster played the full 90 minutes three days later on 29 March 2016 in a 2–1 loss against the Netherlands. Both goals conceded were controversial; Danny Rose protesting that the handball that led to the penalty for the Netherlands first goal was not deliberate, while Phil Jagielka appeared to be fouled in the build-up to Luciano Narsingh's winning goal. Despite the defeat, Forster <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> composed performance and made several excellent saves. On 31 May 2016, Forster was named in England's 23-man squad for UEFA Euro 2016, albeit he was once again understudy to Joe Hart and did not play in any of England's four matches at the tournament.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, Asashōryū {{posted a}} 14–1 record, his fourth {{straight}} championship since returning from injury, {{and became the}} fifth man to win twenty career championships. In March, he dropped his first two bouts but then won thirteen in a row for a 13–2 score. However, this {{was not enough to}} win the title—he lost a playoff {{for the first time in}} his career, to fellow Mongolian Hakuhō. In May he <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> below par 10–5 record, losing to all four ōzeki and maegashira Aminishiki (although he appeared to be carrying an injury). Hakuhō won this tournament as well and was promoted to yokozuna immediately afterwards. Asashōryū had been the sole yokozuna for a total of 21 tournaments since the retirement of Musashimaru in November 2003 – the longest period of time in sumo history. In July he lost to Aminishiki once again on the opening day but rallied to win the next fourteen bouts, taking his 21st title with a 14–1 record. He was suspended by the Sumo Association from the next two tournaments (see below).|$|E
5|$|Taaramäe took fourth overall at Paris–Nice in March, {{winning the}} youth {{classification}} with this performance, which was easily the strongest for an Estonian rider in the event's history. Taaramäe <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> similar strong ride at the two-day, three-stage Critérium International, finishing on the event's final podium in third place, and securing the youth classification. At the concurrent Volta a Catalunya, Dumoulin took two stage wins. The first was in stage 5, on an uphill false flat finish which Dumoulin felt suited him well. The second was more unexpected, {{in that it}} was a dead flat run in to the finish on wide roads, a more traditional field sprint. Dumoulin was delighted to win twice in front of some of the sport's biggest stars, and stated that his next goal would be a major spring classic, perhaps the Amstel Gold Race. Dumoulin, however, was not a factor at the Amstel, finishing 104th, over eight minutes behind the winner.|$|E

5|$|The squad <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> decent ride in {{the stage}} 2 team time trial, {{finishing}} ninth of 22 teams. The result installed Vinokourov into 27th place, 32 seconds off the race lead. Vinokourov took third in stage 4 on the Mûr-de-Bretagne, one of only ten riders to finish together {{at the front of}} the race. He moved up six places to 18th with this result. In stage 8 on Super Besse, Vinokourov and 's Juan Antonio Flecha put in an attack that constituted a clear bid to take the yellow jersey. Starting the day 32 seconds back of race leader Thor Hushovd, Vinokourov surged past Flecha and all remaining members of the morning breakaway other than eventual stage winner Rui Costa. He occupied second position on the road, holding a sufficient time gap that he could take the race leadership, until he was reabsorbed by the depleted front peloton and finished at the back of that group. The result did, however, move Vinokourov up to 11th.|$|E
