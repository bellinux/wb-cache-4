5|$|Fourteen {{women have}} won the Nobel Prize in Literature, {{more than any other}} Nobel Prize with the {{exception}} of the Nobel Peace Prize. Among all the years the Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded, there have been only four instances in which the award was given to two people (1904, 1917, 1966, 1974). There have been seven years in which the Nobel Prize in Literature was not awarded (1914, 1918, 1935, 1940–1943). <b>The</b> <b>country</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> most recipients of the Nobel Prize in Literature is France, with 16, followed by the United States and the United Kingdom with 11.|$|E
5|$|France invaded {{and began}} occupying Syria in 1919 and {{following}} the Battle of Maysalun in July 1920, Faisal was exiled and the kingdom annulled. Al-Bakri left for Amman in Transjordan, which was {{under the authority of}} Faisal's brother King Abdullah. Al-Bakri would later serve as Abdullah's aide in 1921, a position he held for about two years before returning to Syria after the French issued amnesty for political exiles. On his return, he became a member of al-Shahbandar's People's Party and actively sought to topple the French authorities in Syria and align <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ruling Hashemites in Iraq, Transjordan and the Hejaz.

5|$|From January 1995, the {{frequency}} between Steinkjer and Melhus was increased slightly. On 26 September 1995, {{the train station}} in Trondheim reopened as a renovated station that serves both buses, coaches and trains. The investment cost NOK50 million. In 1997, NSB stated that the Trøndelag Commuter Rail was unprofitable and threatened to terminate it, along {{with an array of}} other services, if funding was not increased. The same year, 750,000 people traveled with the commuter rail. The 20% increase that year was in part due to the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1997 being held in Trondheim, and was the service in <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> largest growth.|$|E

When Gekko betrays them by leaving <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> money, Winnie breaks up with Jake. Gekko sets up a hugely successful investment company in London, capitalized by the $100 million. Jake visits him to propose a new trade: Winnie gets her money back, and Gekko can participate in his grandchild's life. Gekko refuses.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, {{a quarter}} of the Welsh {{population}} were born outside Wales, mainly in England; about 3% were born outside the UK. The proportion born in Wales varies across <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> highest percentages in the south Wales valleys and the lowest in mid Wales and parts of the north-east. In both Blaenau Gwent and Merthyr Tydfil, 92% were Welsh-born, compared to only 51% and 56% in the border counties of Flintshire and Powys. Just over 1.75 million Americans report themselves to have Welsh ancestry, as did 440,965 Canadians in Canada's 2006 census.|$|E
3000|$|In {{addition}} to the individual skill scores, the PIAAC data set provides information on hourly wages 15 of employed persons. Table  5 shows the dispersion of numeracy test score results, wages, and years of schooling 16 measured by the coefficient of variation. This data already shows {{that there is no}} clear empirical relationship across countries between wage dispersion and numeracy skill dispersion. <b>Countries</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> highest dispersions of numeracy test scores are the USA, France, Canada, and <b>the</b> UK, whereas <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lowest dispersions are Japan, the Netherlands, and Finland. In terms of wage inequality, <b>countries</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> highest wage dispersion are Japan, the USA, and <b>the</b> UK, and <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lowest wage dispersions are Belgium, Norway, Denmark, and Finland. If there was a strong link between skill dispersion and wage dispersion, the data would be expected to show that <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> highest skill dispersions exhibit the highest wage dispersion and vice versa; this is not always the case here. Additional analysis also shows that the same conclusions hold when wage inequality between different population subgroups is observed. In all the population subgroups examined (men, women, immigrants, non-immigrants, different age subgroups), <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> highest wage dispersions are still Japan and <b>the</b> USA, and <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lowest wage dispersions are Belgium and <b>the</b> Scandinavian <b>countries</b> (ranking of <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> remains intact). 17 [...]...|$|R

5|$|Records of {{historical}} earthquakes and tsunami extend further {{back in time}} in Japan {{than any other country}} that lies along the Pacific Rim (the first documented event occurred in 416 AD). These historical documents supported the date verification of the 1700 Cascadia earthquake that occurred off the Pacific northwest coast of North America. The dilemma of earthquakes in Japan was made a priority following the 1854 Ansei-Nankai event that brought great destruction to the southwest portion of <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> onset of the Meiji period, the feudal government system was superseded by an empire that began to focus on advancing the Japanese society up to Western standards, especially in science.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian {{fleet of}} plug-in {{electric}} cars {{is one of}} the cleanest in the world because 98% of the electricity generated in the country comes from hydropower.

5|$|The United Nations instituted {{mandatory}} {{economic sanctions}} against Rhodesia in December 1966. Over the next year British diplomatic activity regarding Rhodesia was diminished; the UK government's stated policy shifted towards NIBMAR—"no independence before majority rule". Beadle grappled with the Rhodesian problem privately and in correspondence, attempting to reconcile the Smith administration's control over <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> unconstitutional nature of UDI. Erwin Griswold, the United States Solicitor General, wrote to him that {{as he saw it}} the Rhodesian judges could not recognise the post-UDI government as de facto while also claiming to act under the Queen's commission.|$|E
5|$|Ajay {{encounters}} Pagan, who chastises him for fleeing at {{the start}} of the game, claiming that he only ever intended to help Ajay. Pagan offers Ajay a final decision: shoot him now, or listen to him. If Ajay shoots Pagan, the game ends immediately and the credits roll. If Ajay instead chooses to listen, Pagan reveals that Ajay's father sent Ishwari to spy on Pagan in the early days of the Golden Path, but they fell in love and had a daughter together, Lakshmana, which would make her Ajay's half-sister. Ajay's father, Mohan Ghale, killed Lakshmana for Ishwari's betrayal, and Ishwari killed him in turn before leaving <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> infant Ajay. Pagan shows Ajay to a shrine containing Lakshmana's ashes, and Ajay places Ishwari's ashes inside. Pagan then boards a helicopter and departs peacefully, leaving the country in Ajay's hands.|$|E

5|$|Another of Dannatt's {{priorities}} was {{tackling the}} perception of the British operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, as he was concerned the news media and the British public were unaware of the purpose or the intensity of the missions. Disgruntled by increasingly negative coverage, he interrupted a family holiday in Cornwall to fly to Afghanistan in an effort to change the coverage through a series of interviews. During the visit, he managed to meet with his son, Bertie, who was serving in <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Grenadier Guards. Later in 2007, Dannatt raised the same issue in a lecture to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. Earlier that year, Dannatt had taken the decision not to allow Prince Harry to serve in Iraq. However, after Dannatt had brokered an understanding with the British press, Harry was able to serve in Afghanistan for three months in late 2007 and early 2008 until the story broke and he was ordered home.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, exports totalled 90,000 barrels, but by 1964 {{had grown}} to 300,000 barrels. By 1959, sales in Ghana had grown large enough for Guinness to {{establish}} a joint venture in <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> United Africa Company. By 1962, Nigeria had become the largest export market for Guinness, with around 100,000 barrels exported to the country every year. This led the company to build a brewery in Ikeja in western Nigeria to supply the demand; {{it was only the}} third brewery in the company's history. The brewery cost over £2 million, had a 150,000 barrel capacity, and was 60 per cent owned by Guinness Nigeria, 25 per cent by the United Africa Company with the remaining shares held by local Nigerian interests. Breweries followed in Malaysia (1965), Cameroon (1970) and Ghana (1971), whilst licences were granted to other companies to brew Guinness under contract in other African countries and the West Indies. Historically a small proportion of Guinness production, it was this success, especially in Africa but also in Asia, that allowed FES to grow into a 4.5 million hectolitre brand.|$|E

In Canada and Australia, tuberculosis is many times more common among the aboriginal peoples, especially in remote areas. In the United States Native Americans have a fivefold greater mortality from TB, and racial and ethnic minorities accounted for 84% of all reported TB cases.|$|E
