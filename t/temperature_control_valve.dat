50|$|The {{constant}} flux {{cooling jacket}} {{is a relatively}} recent development. It {{is not a single}} jacket but has a series of 20 or more small jacket elements. The <b>temperature</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> operates by opening and closing these channels as required. By varying the heat transfer area in this way, the process temperature can be regulated without altering the jacket temperature.|$|E
50|$|The {{plug flow}} {{characteristics}} of a half coil jacket permits faster displacement of the heat transfer fluid in the jacket (typically less than 60 seconds). This is desirable for good temperature control. It also provides good distribution of heat transfer fluid which avoids the problems of non uniform heating or cooling between the side walls and bottom dish. Like the single jacket design however the inlet heat transfer fluid is also vulnerable to large oscillations (in response to the <b>temperature</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve)</b> in temperature.|$|E
50|$|Most {{non-condensing}} boilers {{could be}} forced to condense through simple control changes. Doing so would reduce fuel consumption considerably, but would quickly destroy any mild steel or cast-iron components of a conventional high-temperature boiler due to the corrosive nature of the condensate. For this reason, most condensing boiler heat-exchangers are made from stainless steel or aluminum/silicon alloy. External stainless steel economizers can be retrofitted to non-condensing boilers to allow them to achieve condensing efficiencies. <b>Temperature</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> are used to blend hot supply water into the return to avoid thermal shock or condensation inside of the boiler.|$|R

50|$|The {{single jacket}} is {{probably}} the oldest design of external cooling jacket. Despite being a tried and tested solution, it has some limitations. On large vessels, it can take many minutes to adjust {{the temperature of the}} fluid in the cooling jacket. This results in sluggish temperature control. The distribution of heat transfer fluid is also far from ideal and the heating or cooling tends to vary between the side walls and bottom dish.

This property was kept when the monomers were used to synthesize both linear and crosslinked polymers, thus making them suitable materials for the synthesis of stimuli-responsive hydrogels [2]. Herein, we present the synthesis of a thermo-responsive tributylhexyl phosphonium 3 -sulfopropyl acrylate (PSPA) crosslinked PIL, followed by its inclusion in a microfluidic device {{to be used as a}} <b>temperature</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>valve.</b> The hydrated hydrogels had their temperature-induced shrinking measured with a digital microscope from 20 °C to 70 °C, in 10 °C intervals.

Following this, hydrogels were polymerized in a microfluidic chip and had their flow characteristics analysed. When placed on a heating element and connected to a syringe pump and a flow microsensor, the hydrogels allowed deionized water to flow through the microfluidic chip at a rate of 140 nL·min- 1 at 50 °C and ~ 15 nL·min- 1 at 25 °C. The required time for the PILc valve to open was ~ 6 s, while the time required for it to close was ~ 8 s.

40|$|Abstract — This {{contribution}} {{presents a}} numerical simulation of water temperature fluctuations in overhead water tanks {{commonly used in}} intermittent water supply systems. Two types of over head tanks with different sizes were modeled; fiberglass tank and galvanized steel tanks. The numerical calculations {{were based on the}} actual outside tank temperature measured during the summer of 2009 in the city of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The numerical and measured water temperatures were in a good match in both tanks. The field and numerical investigations indicate that the water temperature in overhead tanks exceeds safe and comfortable temperature range for regular use in midday hours and it is expected that a considerable amount of valuable water will be wasted as the residents draining out the hot water from the plumbing system. Besides {{it is quite possible that}} scalding in sensitive skins may occurs to some consumers. This valuable water can be saved and possible scalding can be avoided by changing the current plumbing practices in hot regions. This may be achieved by providing the overhead tanks with a <b>temperature</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>valve</b> that allows the hot water to circulate from overhead tank and the external piping system to the underground water tank and maintain an acceptable water temperature in overhead tank. A better control of the water temperature can be achieved if the overhead tank is completely eliminated from the system by installing a booster pump that pumps water directly from underground tank into the plumbing system and eliminating all the external pipes from the plumping system...|$|R

Following this, microfluidic devices were constructed using poly(methyl methacrylate) and pressure sensitive adhesive. After assembly, the chips were fitted on a heating element and connected to a syringe pump with a flow rate of 500 nL·min- 1. A flow microsensor was used to analyze the shrinking-swelling efficiency of the PILc hydrogel valves. A temperature of 50 °C was applied to shrink the hydrogels, followed by a temperature of 25 °C to re-swell the hydrogels. The time required for the PILc valve to open was ~ 6 s, allowing water flow (~ 140 nL·min- 1), while the time required for it to close was ~ 10 s.

Complementary to that paper, this paper attempts to answer some questions related to the selection and operation of <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> in air-conditioning systems comprising multiple chillers and chilled water pumps. Explanations are given on the limits imposed on the cooling outputs of air-handling units when they are equipped with three-way <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> and are fed with chilled water from a central plant comprising multiple chillers and pumps while some of the chillers and pumps have been shutdown under part-load conditions. The Interactions between the <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> and the chilled water pumps, as they are cycled on and off, in a single-loop and a two-loop pumping system are analysed. The conclusions Include that the differential pressure bypass <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> in a single-loop pumping system should be sized for a flow handling capacity significantly greater than the flow rate of one chiller. For minimising the disturbances to the <b>temperature</b> <b>control</b> function of air-conditioning systems, <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> with linear Inherent characteristics should be used for differential pressure bypass control. Furthermore, for a two-loop pumping system, both the chiller on and off settings for a conventional de-coupler bypass control system should be based on surplus flow rates, and the on/off control over the secondary-loop pumps should avoid requiring each pump to handle a flow rate significantly greater than its rated flow rate.

40|$|Environmental Control System (ECS) or Air Management System is {{a generic}} term used in {{aircraft}} industry for system and equipment associated with cooling, heating, ventilation, humidity/contaminant control and pressurization within aircraft occupied compartments, cargo compartments and electronic equipment bays. It also caters to other pneumatic demands like windshield demisting, aerofoil anti-icing, door-sealing, fuel-tank pressurization and engine bay ventilation. The real challenge for an ECS is to operate and supply adequate cooling {{over a wide}} range of ground and flight conditions in a most reliable and efficient manner. Ventilation to the cabin is normally through Environmental Control System (ECS), emergency back-up pressurization system and by ram air. Engines bleed air is used by the environmental control system to provide pressurization to the cabin. Refrigeration of the air is produced by a single bootstrap air cycle system (Air Conditioning Pack). The bleed air temperature control is accomplished automatically by an electronic controller in conjunction with an Electro Pneumatic <b>Temperature</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Valve</b> (TCV). This system is designed to maintain the cabin and crew compartment temperature in the range of 18 to 30 °C up to the aircraft ceiling of altitude of 30, 000 ft. This paper covers the system performance evaluation carried out for various engine power settings during ground tests on the aircraft and by empirical method. Further, instrumentation scheme adapted for measuring pressure and temperature for the above said evaluation has been discussed. Results of the tests show that the required mass flow rate and condition of the air entering in to the cabin is met, thus ECS performance is satisfactory. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the feasibility and advantageous outcomes of modeling a complicated non-linear hybrid dynamical process as an interconnected dynamical system for the purpose of solving a hybrid optimal control problem under the framework of nonlinear model predictive control. This work considers a hybrid model of the startup process of an evaporation system. In this evaporation system a liquid containing mixture of a non-volatile component A and volatile solvents B (water) and C (alcohol) is heated to evaporate the solvents and obtain component A at a higher concentration using a column that is <b>temperature</b> <b>controlled</b> by <b>valves</b> that <b>control</b> the flow of steam through a heat exchanger; <b>valves</b> also <b>control</b> the input feed inflow, vapor outflow and the drain of the concentrated product.

In this thesis we reformulate the mathematical model as an interconnected dynamical model with two autonomous modes. The reformulated model is then used as a constraint set for the optimization of a performance metric characterizing the startup of the evaporation process and its evolution into steady-state operation. The algorithm used to solve the optimization problem is {{a new version of the}} existing algorithms in which the model constraints and cost function computation are performed outside of the sequential quadratic (optimization) program inside fmincon in MATLAB.

In all these houses more than 40 % {{of the domestic}} hot water (DHW) tappings {{turned out to be}} shorter than 10 s. The fraction of total energy used to heat this water varied between 2. 4 % and 10. 2 %, indicating a large influence of households' daily habits. For 60 - 78 % of tappings, the total amount of supplied DH water volume was below 2. 5 litres, which underlines the importance of using small volume pulses for the energy metering. When analysing the off-load behaviour of the DH substations it was established that radiator circuit <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> for the most part of the studied period were working on/off. During periods when there was no radiator load, the primary supply temperature was typically 50 - 60 degrees C, which was higher than expected. The differences in supply temperature level between the substations might be caused by leaking valves or by differences in off-load set point <b>temperature</b> of DHW <b>control</b> <b>valves.</b> Furthermore, the measurements indicate large differences among DHW controllers regarding the characteristics of the feed-forward control. In more than 80 % of the tappings with duration of more than 10 s, an outgoing DHW temperature of at least 40 degrees C was obtained within a maximum of 10 s.
