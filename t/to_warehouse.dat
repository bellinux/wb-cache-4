This included Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro who was suspected of yellow fever, and was eventually sent to Brazil; the artist and humorist, regrettably, made light of Portuguese regulations and poor treatment facilities after his experience.|$|E

25|$|The War of 1812 {{has been}} known as the shipbuilders' war. Ships were built on Point Frederick by the {{successive}} commissioners of the dockyard, Captain Richard O'Conor and Sir Robert Hall. Under {{the terms of the}} Rush–Bagot agreement of 1817, naval forces on Lake Ontario were restricted to one gunboat. Nevertheless, Sir Robert Hall maintained the ships of the fleet in ordinary until his death in 1818. His replacement, Captain Robert Barrie, built a stone frigate <b>to</b> <b>warehouse</b> the gear and rigging from the ships, which were dismantled and housed in Navy Bay. After the wood barracks burned down in 1816, the Stone Frigate became the main building on Point Frederick. Captain Robert Barrie was recalled and the war ships, which were by the early 1830s merely hulks, were auctioned off.|$|E
500|$|Darryl discovers {{warehouse}} worker Val (Ameenah Kaplan) has knitted him a beanie. Unsure if {{she intended}} it as a romantic gift or simply one of friendship, Darryl decides {{to find out}} by giving her a Valentine's Day gift of an expensive pair of cashmere ladies' gloves with a romantic card. Upon discovering that Val had knitted a beanie {{for everyone in the}} warehouse, an embarrassed Darryl passes the gloves off <b>to</b> <b>warehouse</b> worker Nate (Mark Proksch), who is moved by the gift.

He is intrigued, however, when she says the flowers were from her mother, despite him pointing out the caller had had a deep voice and gone by the name Brandon. Darryl decides Val's gift was [...] "a love beanie".|$|E

500|$|The basic {{requirements}} of communal interests {{gave rise to}} risk sharing {{since the dawn of}} civilization. For example, people who lived their entire lives in a camp had the risk of fire, which would leave their band or family without shelter. After barter came into existence, more complex risks emerged and new forms of risk manifested. Merchants embarking on trade journeys bore the risk of losing goods entrusted to them, their own possessions, or even their lives. Intermediaries developed <b>to</b> <b>warehouse</b> and trade goods, which exposed them to financial risk. The primary providers in extended families or households ran the risk of premature death, disability or infirmity, which could leave their dependents to starve. Credit procurement was difficult if the creditor worried about repayment in the event of the borrower's death or infirmity. Alternatively, people sometimes lived too long from a financial perspective, exhausting their savings, if any, or becoming a burden on others in the extended family or society [...]|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we address the {{location}} routing problem (LRP) in which vehicle routing and warehouse location/allocation {{decisions are made}} simultaneously. LRP deals with determining the optimal number of warehouses {{as well as their}} locations while assigning customers <b>to</b> <b>warehouses</b> so that the shortest vehicle routes are achieved. The objective is to minimize total vehicle related costs (fixed vehicle cost and route cost) and the cost of operating the <b>warehouses.</b> <b>To</b> solve this NP-hard problem, we propose a clustering based heuristic approach which consists of three parts. Firstly, we determine the customer clusters based on vehicle capacities, i. e. all customers in the cluster are serviced by the same vehicle. Secondly, we solve a traveling salesman problem for each cluster. Thirdly, we attempt to improve the routes by using local search techniques. Finally, the routed clusters are assigned <b>to</b> <b>warehouses...</b>|$|R
