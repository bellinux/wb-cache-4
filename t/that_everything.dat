5|$|A {{persistent}} rumour {{claims a}} film adaptation of Tipping the Velvet will be directed by Sofia Coppola, starring Beyoncé Knowles and Eva Longoria. However, Longoria insists <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> about the rumour is false, {{right down to}} quotes cited to her and Knowles.

5|$|Bush was not {{a natural}} melodist à la Dvorák, though he could produce an {{appealing}} tune when he set his mind to it. But he was a first-rate contrapuntist, and his harmonic world can glow with a rare internal warmth. It {{would be foolish to}} claim <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> he wrote was a masterpiece – and equally idiotic to turn our backs on the many outstanding scores still awaiting assiduous attention.|$|E
5|$|Continuing to the Order's {{underground}} facility, Alex {{is captured}} by Judge Holloway, who reveals <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> {{that has happened}} {{is due to a}} broken pact.

5|$|The Universe can {{be defined}} as <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> exists, <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> has existed, and <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> will exist. According to our current understanding, the Universe {{consists}} of spacetime, forms of energy (including electromagnetic radiation and matter), and the physical laws that relate them. The Universe encompasses all of life, all of history, and some philosophers and scientists suggest that it even encompasses ideas such as mathematics and logic.|$|R
5|$|During the {{two weeks}} leading up to the Grand Prix, Räikkönen and Felipe Massa {{released}} statements to the press saying they believed <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> would be different in Canada because of the very different conditions—as shown at Paul Ricard.

Before Zampanò's release from prison, Il Matto proposes that there are alternatives to Gelsomina's servitude, and imparts his philosophy <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> and everyone has a purpose – even a pebble, even her. A nun suggests that Gelsomina's purpose in life is comparable to her own. But, when Gelsomina offers Zampanò marriage, he brushes her off.|$|E

5|$|According to Znaniecki, {{sociology}} can {{be divided}} into the study of four dynamic social systems: social action theory, social relation theory, social actors theory, and social groups theory. Znaniecki saw social actions as the foundation of a society, as they give rise to more complex social relations, and he saw this theory as the foundation of all the others. Unlike Max Weber, he did not believe <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> can be reduced to social actions; he was also quite skeptical of any insights coming from the science of psychology, which he held in low esteem.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} to speak English, the children– Ralph says just the surviving girl– {{explained that they}} came from a land where the sun never shone and the light was like twilight. William says the children called their home St Martin's Land; Ralph adds <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> there was green. According to William, the children were unable to account for their arrival in Woolpit; they had been herding their father's cattle when they heard a loud noise (according to William, the bells of Bury St Edmunds) and suddenly found themselves by the wolf pit where they were found. Ralph says that they had become lost when they followed the cattle into a cave and, after being guided {{by the sound of}} bells, eventually emerged into our land.|$|E

The Save FNL Campaign raised a total of $15,840 for 18,750 footballs, $2061 for charity, and $924 worth of DVDs for troops stationed overseas.|$|E
5|$|An {{undertaking}} of {{the restoration}} team was <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> would be handled in a transparent fashion, that reporters, art historians {{and others with}} a bona fide interest should have ready access to information and to view the work. However, a single company, Nippon Television Network Corporation, had sole photography rights. Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic of The New York Times, wrote, in 1991, that the criticism of {{the restoration of the}} ceiling and lunettes was in part fuelled by the Nippon Television Network's reluctance to make public those photographs that they had taken by exclusive right, which had recorded every stage of the process and which were the only solid evidence that the work was being done appropriately.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor in}} Wallace's {{thinking}} was his belief that, {{because of the}} action of natural selection, organisms were {{in a state of}} balance with their environment, and <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> in nature, even disease-causing organisms, served a useful purpose in the natural order of things; he feared vaccination might upset that natural balance with unfortunate results. Wallace and other anti-vaccinationists pointed out that vaccination, which at the time was often done in a sloppy and unsanitary manner, could be dangerous.|$|E

5|$|It {{was founded}} in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC. The Stoics taught that {{emotions}} resulted in errors of judgment which were destructive, due to the active relationship between cosmic determinism and human freedom, {{and the belief that}} it is virtuous to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is in accord with nature. Because of this, the Stoics presented their philosophy {{as a way of life}} (lex divina), and they thought that the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how a person behaved. To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they taught <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> was rooted in nature.|$|E
5|$|Other {{relationships}} {{include the}} algorithmic analysis of artworks by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, {{the finding that}} traditional batiks from different regions of Java have distinct fractal dimensions, and stimuli to mathematics research, especially Filippo Brunelleschi's theory of perspective, which eventually led to Girard Desargues's projective geometry. A persistent view, based ultimately on the Pythagorean notion of harmony in music, holds <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> was arranged by Number, that God is the geometer of the world, and that therefore the world's geometry is sacred, as seen in artworks such as William Blake's The Ancient of Days.|$|E
5|$|Priestley {{strongly}} {{suggested that}} there is no mind-body duality, and put forth a materialist philosophy in these works; that is, one founded on the principle <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> in the universe is made of matter that we can perceive. He also contended that discussing the soul is impossible because it is made of a divine substance, and humanity cannot perceive the divine. Despite his separation of the divine from the mortal, this position shocked and angered many of his readers, who believed that such a duality was necessary for the soul to exist.|$|E
