5|$|An individual's {{belief that}} an {{environmental}} claim lacks honesty {{can have a}} negative effect on attitude toward a brand. If, on the other side, the consumer grants credibility to the claim, the individual will behave more respectfully toward the environment. The problem in extending that credibility to a brand is that consumers interested in ecological products generally are skeptical of commercial advertisements. This skepticism is due to various factors such as lack of language, the absence of scientific knowledge necessary to interpret advertising meaning, and, in particular, the falsehoods and exaggeration of some advertising techniques. To resolve this problem, independent organizations may choose to guarantee messages on <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>benefits</b> of brands with environmental labeling systems sponsored by independent organizations. This practice tries to diminish perceived biases in environmental information by promoting standardization of the information with the aim of improving confidence in the evaluation of environmental benefits of products—all of which should positively affect the purchase intention.|$|E

South Africa uses coal-based electricity generation and the electricity required for Gautrain would come from outside the Gauteng region.

25|$|Aside from <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>benefits</b> {{of using}} {{recycled}} material, plastic ties usually replace timber ties soaked in creosote, {{the latter being}} a toxic chemical, and are themselves recyclable. Hybrid plastic railroad ties and composite ties are used in other rail applications such as underground mining operations, industrial zones, humid environments and densely populated areas. Hybrid railroad ties are also used to be partly exchanged with rotten wooden ties, which will result in continuous track stiffness. Hybrid plastic ties and composite ties also offer benefits on bridges and viaducts, because they lead to better distribution of forces and reduction of vibrations into respectively bridge girders or the ballast. This is due to better damping properties of hybrid plastic ties and composite ties, which will decrease the intensity of vibrations {{as well as the}} sound production.|$|E

50|$|Secondly, Fullerton and Metcalf say the {{previous}} literature on Pigovian taxes focused {{too heavily on}} the revenue dividend and too lightly on <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> dividend of environmental taxes.

2500|$|The {{analysis}} did {{not attempt}} to quantify <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>benefits</b> of reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The report also stated that the [...] "net financial impact of the program on households in different income brackets would depend in large part on how many allowances were sold (versus given away), how the free allowances were allocated, and how any proceeds from selling allowances were used. That net impact would reflect both the added costs that households experienced because of higher prices and the share of the allowance value that they received in the form of benefit payments, rebates, tax decreases or credits, wages, and returns on their investments." [...] In other words, while a cap and trade system imposes costs on high emitters, it can generate revenues for low emitters that sell permits to them.
