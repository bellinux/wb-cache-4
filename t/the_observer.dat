50|$|The {{times of}} sunset and sunrise vary with <b>the</b> <b>observer's</b> {{location}} (longitude and latitude), so the dates when {{day and night}} are equal also depend upon <b>the</b> <b>observer's</b> location.|$|R
30|$|Four board-certified nuclear {{medicine}} physicians with 7 – 10  years of experience from two departments of {{nuclear medicine}} (Aalborg and Herning) evaluated the UF-SPECT/CT and re-evaluated the std-SPECT/CT. All of <b>the</b> <b>observers</b> were experienced with std-SPECT/CT. <b>The</b> <b>observers</b> {{had access to}} the clinical data provided by the referring physician and to the bone-related questionnaire responses. They had no access to the previous imaging data or to the clinical report of the WB-BS + std-SPECT/CT findings. <b>The</b> <b>observers</b> from Herning had approximately 1  year of clinical experience with UF-SPECT/CT in selected patients. In contrast, <b>the</b> <b>observers</b> from Aalborg had no experience with UF-SPECT/CT.|$|R

5|$|Unless a star {{is being}} {{observed}} {{from the direction}} of its pole, sections of the surface have some amount of movement toward or away from <b>the</b> <b>observer.</b> The component of movement that is in the direction of <b>the</b> <b>observer</b> is called the radial velocity. For the portion of the surface with a radial velocity component toward <b>the</b> <b>observer,</b> the radiation is shifted to a higher frequency because of Doppler shift. Likewise the region that has a component moving away from <b>the</b> <b>observer</b> is shifted to a lower frequency. When the absorption lines of a star are observed, this shift {{at each end of the}} spectrum causes the line to broaden. However, this broadening must be carefully separated from other effects that can increase the line width.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecliptic}} is {{not normally}} noticeable from Earth's surface because Earth rotates, carrying <b>the</b> <b>observer</b> through {{the cycles of}} sunrise and sunset, which obscure the Sun's apparent motion {{against the background of}} fixed stars.|$|E
5|$|There are, in addition, {{matrices}} {{that effect}} Lorentz boosts. These {{can be thought}} of, in the passive view, as (instantly!) giving the coordinate system (and with it <b>the</b> <b>observer)</b> a velocity in a chosen direction.|$|E
50|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>observers,</b> <b>the</b> mosque {{was built}} during the Ottoman reign.|$|R
5000|$|Bistromathics {{itself is}} simply a revolutionary new way of {{understanding}} the behaviour of numbers. Just as Albert Einstein's general relativity theory observed that space was not an absolute but depended on <b>the</b> <b>observer's</b> movement in space, and that time was not an absolute, but depended on <b>the</b> <b>observer's</b> movement in time, so it is now realized that numbers are not absolute, but depend on <b>the</b> <b>observer's</b> movement in restaurants.|$|R

5|$|Birdsong {{is one of}} Faulks's best-received {{works of}} fiction, both by the public and amongst reviewers. The British press offered {{considerable}} praise, with positive reviews from Today, The Guardian, <b>The</b> <b>Observer,</b> The Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday, The Sunday Express, The Sunday Telegraph, The Times Literary Supplement, The Spectator and The Scotsman. American and other international press reviews were similarly positive.|$|E
5000|$|... "Records of eye {{movements}} {{show that}} <b>the</b> <b>observer's</b> attention is usually held only by certain {{elements of the}} picture.... Eye movement reflects the human thought processes; so <b>the</b> <b>observer's</b> thought may be followed to some extent from records of eye movement (the thought accompanying {{the examination of the}} particular object). It is easy to determine from these records which elements attract <b>the</b> <b>observer's</b> eye (and, consequently, his thought), in what order, and how often." ...|$|R
40|$|Fractional {{descriptor}} reduced-order nonlinear observers for a {{class of}} fractional descriptor continuous-time nonlinear systems are proposed.

5|$|Blazars are {{believed}} to be an active galaxy with a relativistic jet that is pointed in the direction of Earth. A radio galaxy emits radio frequencies from relativistic jets. A unified model of these types of active galaxies explains their differences based on the viewing angle of <b>the</b> <b>observer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Consequences of this {{include the}} time–space frame of a moving body {{appearing}} {{to slow down}} and contract (in the direction of motion) when measured in the frame of <b>the</b> <b>observer.</b> This paper also argued that the idea of a luminiferous aether—one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time—was superfluous.|$|E
5|$|Coward spelled {{his first}} name with the diæresis ("I didn't put the dots over the 'e' in Noël. The {{language}} did. Otherwise it's not Noël but Nool!"). The press and many book publishers failed to follow suit, and his name was printed as 'Noel' in The Times, <b>The</b> <b>Observer</b> and other contemporary newspapers and books. The papers of Noël Coward are held in the University of Birmingham.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe paper proposes Luenberger-like {{observers}} for {{a rotating}} body-beam system. The latter {{is described by}} a partial differential equation and its dynamic is governed a unitary group. <b>The</b> <b>observers</b> proposed in <b>the</b> paper are able to reconstitute the dynamic evolution of the beam profile, by measuring the moment force on the boundary only. Meanwhile we propose a reliable numerical scheme, based on a finite element method, in order to simulate the observation system and <b>the</b> <b>observers.</b> <b>The</b> efficiency of our proposed scheme and the performances of <b>the</b> <b>observers</b> are illustrated with numerical simulation results...|$|R
25|$|Whether a star is {{circumpolar}} {{depends upon}} <b>the</b> <b>observer's</b> latitude. Since <b>the</b> altitude {{of the north}} or south celestial pole (whichever is visible) equals the absolute value of <b>the</b> <b>observer's</b> latitude, any star whose angular distance from the visible celestial pole {{is less than the}} absolute latitude will be circumpolar. For example, if <b>the</b> <b>observer's</b> latitude is 50° N, any star will be circumpolar if it is less than 50° from the north celestial pole. If <b>the</b> <b>observer's</b> latitude is 35° S, then all stars within 35° of the south celestial pole are circumpolar. Stars on the celestial equator are not circumpolar when observed from any latitude in either hemisphere of the Earth.|$|R
40|$|Socially-influenced {{learning}} was studied in observer pigeons that observed a demonstrator in an adjacent chamber performing a target response comprising {{standing on a}} box and pecking a key 10 times. In Experiment 1 {{there was no evidence}} for social learning in the absence of reinforcement of <b>the</b> <b>observer's</b> behavior. When <b>the</b> target response was already established in <b>the</b> <b>observer's</b> repertoire, but was not differentially reinforced in relation to the demonstrator's behavior, rates of extinction were not influenced by the demonstrator's behavior (Experiment 2). Reinforcement of <b>the</b> <b>observer's</b> target response {{in the presence of the}} modeled target response, and not in its absence, resulted in control of <b>the</b> <b>observer's</b> responding by <b>the</b> behavior of the demonstrator (Experiments 3 and 4). This control was extended in Experiment 5 to deferred responses that occurred following a delay since the demonstrator's target responses. The acquisition of social influence depended on differential reinforcement of <b>the</b> <b>observer's</b> target response, with the demonstrator's target behavior serving as the explicit discriminative stimulus...|$|R
5|$|Finally, two special transformations {{are used}} to invert the {{coordinate}} system in space, space inversion, and in time, time reversal. In the first case, the space coordinate axes are reversed. The latter is reversal of the time direction. This is thought of, in the passive view, as having <b>the</b> <b>observer</b> set their clock at minus what it shows and then have the clock's hands move counterclockwise. Physical time progresses forward.|$|E
5|$|In mimesis (also called masquerade), the camouflaged object {{looks like}} {{something}} else which is of no special interest to <b>the</b> <b>observer.</b> Mimesis is common in prey animals, for example when a peppered moth caterpillar mimics a twig, or a grasshopper mimics a dry leaf. It {{is also found in}} nest structures; some eusocial wasps, such as Leipomeles dorsata, build a nest envelope in patterns that mimic the leaves surrounding the nest.|$|E
5|$|Leicester {{also built}} a loggia, or open gallery, beside the great keep {{to lead to}} the new formal gardens. The loggia was {{designed}} to elegantly frame the view as <b>the</b> <b>observer</b> slowly admired the gardens, and was a new design in the 16th century, only recently imported from Italy.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>Observers</b> {{comment on}} this {{development}} revealing that they planted the test answers for Danny to find, hoping it will change him. <b>The</b> <b>Observers</b> are convinced Danny will still become evil because he made the wrong decision, but Clockwork insists otherwise.|$|R
50|$|The precise {{location}} of the assumed position has no great impact on the result, {{as long as it}} is reasonably close to <b>the</b> <b>observer's</b> actual position. An assumed position within 1 degree of arc of <b>the</b> <b>observer's</b> actual position is usually considered acceptable.|$|R

5|$|On 23 August 1994, in a {{boathouse}} on the Scottish {{island of}} Jura, Drummond and Cauty incinerated £1,000,000 in cash. The burning was witnessed {{by an old}} friend of Drummond's, freelance journalist Jim Reid, who subsequently wrote an article about the ceremony for <b>The</b> <b>Observer.</b> It was filmed on Super 8 by their friend Gimpo.|$|E
5|$|On 5 April <b>The</b> <b>Observer</b> (the Guardians sister paper) {{published}} the first photograph of Tomlinson {{lying on the}} ground next to riot police. Over the next few days the IPCC told reporters that Tomlinson's family were not surprised that he had had a heart attack. When journalists asked whether he had been in contact with police officers before his death, they were told the speculation would upset the family.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{methods for}} tool {{position}} estimation of industrial robots. It {{is assumed that}} the motor angular position and the tool acceleration are measured. <b>The</b> considered <b>observers</b> are {{different versions of the}} extended Kalman filter as well as a deterministic observer. A method for tuning <b>the</b> <b>observers</b> is suggested and the robustness of the methods is investigated. <b>The</b> <b>observers</b> are evaluated experimentally on a commercial industrial robot...|$|R
40|$|In the {{literature}} on Vatican II the influence of <b>the</b> <b>observers</b> on <b>the</b> final documents is often presupposed, but seldom studied in detail. This article focuses on their reactions, formulated in the Autumn of 1963, on the new draft of the future decree on ecumenism, De Oecumenismo, a decree in which <b>the</b> <b>observers</b> were mostly interested. A detailed study of the documents in which the collaborators of the Secretariat for Christian Unity motivated their acceptance or rejection of certain modifications proposed by the Council fathers, {{makes it clear that}} a number of changes finds its origin in critical remarks made by <b>the</b> <b>observers.</b> <b>The</b> harmonious relation of Council and observers, and especially of the staff of the Secretariat for Christian Unity and <b>the</b> <b>observers,</b> was not one of “fratres separati” but of “fratres seiuncti”. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{generalized}} differentiation-integration observer is presented based on sensors selection. <b>The</b> proposed differentiation-integration <b>observer</b> can estimate <b>the</b> multiple integrals and high-order derivatives of a signal, synchronously. The parameters selection rules are presented for <b>the</b> differentiation-integration <b>observer.</b> <b>The</b> theoretical results are {{confirmed by the}} frequency-domain analysis. The effectiveness of <b>the</b> proposed <b>observer</b> are verified through the numerical simulations on a quadrotor aircraft: i) through <b>the</b> differentiation-integration <b>observer,</b> <b>the</b> attitude angle and the uncertainties in attitude dynamics are estimated synchronously from the measurements of angular velocity; ii) a control law is designed based on <b>the</b> <b>observers</b> to drive <b>the</b> aircraft to track a reference trajectory...|$|R
