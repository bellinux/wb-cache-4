5|$|The {{numbers of}} women with SCI giving birth and having healthy babies are increasing. Around a half to two-thirds of women with SCI report {{they might want to}} have children, and 14–20% do get {{pregnant}} at least once. Although female fertility is not usually permanently reduced by SCI, there is a stress response <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> immediately post-injury that alters levels of fertility-related hormones in the body. In about half of women, menstruation stops after the injury but then returns within an average of five months—it returns within a year for a large majority. After menstruation returns, women with SCI become pregnant at a rate close to that {{of the rest of the}} population.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the equatorial region of Vesta is sculpted {{by a series of}} concentric troughs. The largest is named Divalia Fossa (10–20km wide, 465km long). Despite the fact that Vesta is a one-seventh the size of the Moon, Divalia Fossa dwarfs the Grand Canyon. A second series, inclined to the equator, is found further north. The largest of the northern troughs is named Saturnalia Fossa (≈ 40km wide, > 370km long). These troughs are thought to be large-scale graben resulting from the impacts that created Rheasilvia and Veneneia craters, respectively. They are some of the longest chasms in the Solar System, nearly as long as Ithaca Chasma on Tethys. The troughs may be graben that formed after another asteroid collided with Vesta, a process <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> only in a body that, like Vesta, is differentiated. Vesta's differentiation {{is one of the reasons}} why scientists consider it a protoplanet.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the initial}} {{analysis}} is correct, {{there is another}} effect <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen,</b> known as the overvoltage effect. Additional voltage is sometimes required, beyond the voltage predicted by the E°cell. This {{may be due to}} kinetic rather than thermodynamic considerations. In fact, it has been proven that the activation energy for the chloride ion is very low, hence favorable in kinetic terms. In other words, although the voltage applied is thermodynamically sufficient to drive electrolysis, the rate is so slow that to make the process proceed in a reasonable time frame, the voltage of the external source has to be increased (hence, overvoltage).|$|E
25|$|Urban {{flooding}} is the inundation of land {{or property}} in a built environment, particularly in more densely populated areas, caused by rainfall overwhelming {{the capacity of}} drainage systems, such as storm sewers. Although sometimes triggered by events such as flash flooding or snowmelt, urban flooding is a condition, characterized by its repetitive and systemic impacts on communities, <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> {{regardless of whether or}} not affected communities are located within designated floodplains or near any body of water. Aside from potential overflow of rivers and lakes, snowmelt, stormwater or water released from damaged water mains may accumulate on property and in public rights-of-way, seep through building walls and floors, or backup into buildings through sewer pipes, toilets and sinks.|$|E

500|$|At the 2015 IPC Athletics World Championships in Doha, Ballard {{won gold}} medals in the Women's 200m T53 in a {{championship}} record time of 29.33 and the Women's 400m T53. After winning the 400m, Ballard said: [...] "This is the one I wanted. I was so nervous coming in, you try and tell yourself that the worst thing <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> is a loss and starting again tomorrow, {{but the reality is}} that this matters so much. I was so scared before the race, perhaps it gave me the adrenalin to get it done. I’ve just worked so hard for this for so long." [...] She also won a bronze medal in the Women's 800mm T54 behind gold medallist Madison de Rozario.|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times Betsy Sharkey {{was more}} positive, stating that [...] "the funniest stuff {{comes from the}} kind of {{situational}} misfires <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> when dudes try to do things, like catch aliens, that they are clearly not cut out to do". She considered that Schaffer's previous experience directing short comic videos for Saturday Night Live was partially responsible for individual comic moments broken up by transitions where [...] "things tend to fall apart". Screencrushs Matt Singer was positive, calling the film funny and praising the improvisational feel of the scenes and [...] "ingenious" [...] set-pieces, but was critical of the promotion of Costco and Costco products throughout. Boxoffices James Rocchi offered a positive stance, stating that the [...] "plot moves, the supporting cast is lively and the action stays small-scale and intimate, never overwhelming the laughs"; he felt that the profanity and vulgarity never became [...] "stale". Rocchi, however, commented that the film was forgettable and [...] "disposable".|$|E
500|$|In his mature works El Greco {{demonstrated}} a characteristic tendency to dramatize {{rather than to}} describe. The strong spiritual emotion transfers from painting directly to the audience. According to Pacheco, El Greco's perturbed, violent and at times seemingly careless-in-execution art was due to a studied effort to acquire a freedom of style. El Greco's preference for exceptionally tall and slender figures and elongated compositions, which served both his expressive purposes and aesthetic principles, led him to disregard {{the laws of nature}} and elongate his compositions to ever greater extents, particularly when they were destined for altarpieces. The anatomy of the human body becomes even more otherworldly in El Greco's mature works; for The Virgin of the Immaculate Conception El Greco asked to lengthen the altarpiece itself by another [...] "because in this way the form will be perfect and not reduced, which is the worst thing <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> to a figure'". A significant innovation of El Greco's mature works is the interweaving between form and space; a reciprocal relationship is developed between the two which completely unifies the painting surface. This interweaving would re-emerge three centuries later in the works of Cézanne and Picasso.|$|E

500|$|When Ehrich first {{stepped into}} the role, he stated: [...] "There [...] so many places where they can go with this role. I have just gotten back into Genoa City. It’s such a {{vulnerable}} age, so really there [...] so many different paths I can go down. And there’s so much <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen.</b> I’m very, very curious to see where they go with it." [...] When asked how he would describe Fenmore, Ehrich said: [...] "He is definitely figuring himself out. You’re {{on the brink of}} adulthood. You have to start taking a bit of responsibility. [...] your hormones start kicking in hardcore. So he’s definitely going through some stuff." [...] In another interview, he described Fenmore as [...] "trying to find his place in the world", saying: [...] "When Fen first came back, I think he was at a very vulnerable age and was trying to find his place in the world; just really figure out who he is. He has such a strict dad, who just became D.A., so of course his morals are so strong and everything is black and white, right or wrong." [...] Luke Kerr of Zap2it wrote that the character had become [...] "creepy" [...] during his angst and acting out.|$|E
500|$|Metcalfe {{spoke of}} the new storyline, saying how [...] "honoured" [...] she was {{to take part in}} the storyline as well as praising the writer, Anna Clements: [...] "I'm honoured to have been given this storyline to raise {{awareness}} of such an important cause. Count the Kicks is a fantastic charity, which aims to teach expectant mothers about noticing changes in their pregnancy to reduce the risk of stillbirth. And working with Sands has helped me understand how Mercedes would cope with life after her baby has died. Mercedes has already been through so much tragedy in her life, but the death of her son will show a much more fragile side to her character. The scripts are brilliantly written by Anna Clements and with the help of the two charities, I was able to really understand what Mercedes is going through." [...] Erica Stewart, the bereavement support services manager at Sands, said: [...] "We're pleased to have been approached by the researchers and writers at Hollyoaks for advice and help to ensure that this heartbreaking storyline is portrayed truthfully and sensitively. Stillbirth is not rare and it's a tragedy <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> to anyone. Sadly thousands of babies die each year in the UK. In 2013, over 100 babies every week were stillborn or died soon after birth. For a show like Hollyoaks with a youth focus to be covering this devastating experience is a brilliant way of raising awareness of the issues surrounding baby death among a younger audience who may have not otherwise come across them." [...] Metcalfe later further discussed the storyline, revealing that when she read the scripts she had [...] "a lump in my throat", which made cry and when she had finished reading the scripts, she was [...] "sat their sobbing". She continued to say: [...] "When it came to playing it on set I did minimal rehearsals because I didn't want to wear out the true meaning of the words." [...] before praising the script writing, calling them [...] "brilliant" [...] and stating she did not have to work hard to find the [...] "level of emotion", [...] "The words were all there on the page. I broke down every time." ...|$|E
