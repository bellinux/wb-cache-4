Despite {{not wanting to be}} {{involved}} with the case, already dealing with a divorce and estrangement from his son Daniel, Eric reluctantly joins Kerry and Sergeant Daniel Rigg in leading a SWAT team to the factory which produced the lock from Marks' trap. There they find and apprehend John Kramer, the Jigsaw Killer, who is weak from cancer. He indicates several computer monitors showing eight people trapped in a house; arsonist Obi Tate, his only known survivor Amanda Young, business man Gus Colyard, gangster Jonas Singer, Laura Hunter, drug dealer Xavier Chavez, prostitute Addison Corday, and Daniel. A nerve agent filling <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>will</b> kill them within two hours, but Kramer assures Eric that following his own game, simply sitting and chatting with John, will see his son Daniel returned to him unharmed. At Kerry's urging, Eric agrees in order to buy time for the tech team to arrive and trace the video signal.|$|E

25|$|In addition, war {{narratives}} {{were transformed}} into literature by (among others) the publishing houses, which distorted the perception {{and treatment of}} captivity. Nicolas Beaupré cites the letter of one of Éditions Berger-Levrault’s directors in which he insists on giving a direction to the publication of war stories, more for vainglory than a depiction of events: “Currently we, {{more than any other}} publishing house, are editing, as much at Nancy as in Paris, with very restrained means. If we can hold on and publish only good publications on the war, <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>will</b> emerge from the conflict in more of a starring role than before”.

2500|$|But the Gemara {{asked whether}} a synagogue could {{be subject to}} house plagues. For a Baraita (which the Gemara later {{identified}} with {{the view of the}} Rabbis) taught that one might assume that synagogues and houses of learning are subject to house plagues, and therefore [...] says, [...] "he who has <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>will</b> come," [...] to exclude those houses — like synagogues — that do not belong to any one individual. The Gemara proposed a resolution to the conflict by explaining that the first Baraita reflected the opinion of Rabbi Meir, while the second Baraita reflected the opinion of the Rabbis. For a Baraita taught that a synagogue that contains a dwelling for the synagogue attendant is required to have a mezuzah, but a synagogue that contains no dwelling, Rabbi Meir declares it is required to have a mezuzah, but the Sages exempt it.|$|E
2500|$|The oldest Germanic {{languages}} {{have the}} typical complex inflected morphology of old Indo-European languages, with {{four or five}} noun cases; verbs marked for person, number, tense and mood; multiple noun and verb classes; few or no articles; and rather free word order. [...] The old Germanic languages are famous for having only two tenses (present and past), with three PIE past-tense aspects (imperfect, aorist, and perfect/stative) merged into one and no new tenses (future, pluperfect, etc.) developing. [...] There were three moods: indicative, subjunctive (developed from the PIE optative mood) and imperative. [...] Gothic verbs {{had a number of}} archaic features inherited from PIE that were lost in the other Germanic languages with few traces, including dual endings, an inflected passive voice (derived from the PIE mediopassive voice), and a class of verbs with reduplication in the past tense (derived from the PIE perfect). [...] The complex tense system of modern English (e.g. In three months, <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>will</b> still be being built or If you had not acted so stupidly, we would never have been caught) is almost entirely due to subsequent developments (although paralleled in many of the other Germanic languages).|$|E
2500|$|The {{first day}} of Tết is {{reserved}} for the [...] nuclear family. Children receive a red envelope containing money from their elders. This tradition is called mừng tuổi (happy new age) {{in the north and}} lì xì in the south. Usually, children wear their new clothes and give their elders the traditional Tết greetings before receiving the money. Since the Vietnamese believe that the first visitor a family receives in the year determines their fortune for the entire year, people never enter any house on the first day without being invited first. The act of being the first person to enter a house on Tết is called [...] xông đất, xông nhà or đạp đất, {{which is one of the}} most important rituals during Tết. According to Vietnamese tradition, if good things come to the family on the {{first day of}} the lunar New Year, the entire following year will also be full of blessings. Usually, a person of good temper, morality, and success will be the lucky sign for the host family and be invited first into the house. However, just to be safe, the owner of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>will</b> leave the house a few minutes before midnight and come back just as the clock strikes midnight to prevent anyone else entering the house first who might potentially bring any unfortunate events in the new year to the household.|$|E

50|$|The 2.0L Zetec engine {{has seen}} some issues. Although {{the block and}} {{cylinder}} head are thermally stable, <b>the</b> coolant outlet <b>housing</b> for <b>the</b> thermostat is not. <b>The</b> <b>housing</b> used in <b>the</b> 2000-2004 model year US Ford Focus and 2001-2004 model year Ford Escape with 16-Valve DOHC engine is made from ABS plastic. It is bolted {{to the surface of}} the cylinder head on the right side of the engine with three bolts. The mating surface seals to the cylinder head with a rubber O-ring style gasket. The O-ring is held in place by a lip on <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> which is prone to cracking. The immediate inner portion of <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> <b>will</b> exhibit pitting and bubbling. Over time, pieces of the lip will break off, releasing plastic fragments into the cooling system. These fragments have not been known to cause any severe damage to the cooling system but the damaged lip on <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> <b>will</b> cause <b>the</b> O-ring seal to rupture. This allows coolant to leak out onto the upper transmission bell <b>housing.</b> <b>The</b> failure can result in severe loss of coolant.|$|R
2500|$|However, {{many of the}} tenses of {{the other}} {{languages}} (e.g. future, future perfect, pluperfect, Latin imperfect) are not cognate {{with each other and}} represent separate innovations in each language. [...] For example, the Greek future uses a -s- ending, apparently derived from a desiderative construction that in PIE was part of the system of derivational morphology (not the inflectional system); the Sanskrit future uses a -sy- ending, from a different desiderative verb construction and often with a different ablaut grade from Greek; while the Latin future uses endings derived either from the PIE subjunctive or from the PIE verb * [...] "to be". [...] Similarly, the Latin imperfect and pluperfect stem from Italic innovations and are not cognate with the corresponding Greek or Sanskrit forms; and while the Greek and Sanskrit pluperfect tenses appear cognate, there are no parallels in any other Indo-European languages, leading to the conclusion that this tense is either a shared Greek-Sanskrit innovation or separate, coincidental developments in the two languages. In this respect, Proto-Germanic can be said to be characterized by the failure to innovate new synthetic tenses as much as the loss of existing tenses. Later Germanic languages did innovate new tenses, derived through periphrastic constructions, with Modern English likely possessing the most elaborated tense system ("Yes, <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>will</b> still be being built a month from now"). On the other hand, even the past tense was later lost (or widely lost) in most High German dialects as well as in Afrikaans.|$|E

40|$|In {{the end of}} 2014 Stockholm city {{assigned}} the project “Stockholmshusen” to <b>the</b> three public <b>housing</b> companies Familjebostäder, Stockholmshem and Svenska bostäder. The purpose of the project is to build 3 500 - 5 000 apartments with reasonable rents during four years. In this project the time for developing local plans, from start to approval, {{is supposed to be}} shortened from 24 to 15 - 18 months with help from the municipal’s technical departments. The project was founded by <b>the</b> public <b>housing</b> companies because of <b>the</b> increasing <b>housing</b> shortage, high costs for construction and long processing time for developing local plans in Sweden. The main goal with this thesis is to examine the “Stockholmshusen” project and how the three companies will execute the assignment. The project is studied with the perspective and theory Client order decoupling point (CODP) in order to decide where in the project the CODP lies in the project. The result of this study is presented as a case study with empiricism gathered with a qualitative research method, based on a literature study and interviews with four representatives from <b>the</b> public <b>housing</b> companies. <b>The</b> <b>housing</b> companies <b>will</b> sign framework agreements with three to five construction companies in order to design and construct <b>the</b> <b>houses.</b> <b>The</b> <b>houses</b> <b>will</b> be combinations of the construction companies own building systems and <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> companies’ requirements. <b>The</b> <b>houses</b> <b>will</b> be variable in length, height and color. Three different types of <b>houses</b> <b>will</b> be created: lamellar, tower blocks and block <b>houses.</b> In <b>the</b> best case this will result in a catalogue of 15 varieties of <b>houses,</b> which <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> companies <b>will</b> choose from later on, in the upcoming building projects. To succeed with <b>the</b> project <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> companies together with the technical departments will have to develop new working methods. The initiative can however be a part of decreasing the shortage of housings and be a part of developing the construction industry. This project is an attempt to modernize and shorten the process of developing local plans and it could make it more profitable for the construction companies in Sweden to develop industrial construction methods.
