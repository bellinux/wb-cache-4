He looked so provokingly intelligent and confidential, that, had I dared, I {{could have been}} more angry than ever I was in my life; but I must be on good behaviour, and my walks are now limited within his farm precincts, where the good gentleman can amble along by my side without inconvenience. I have detected him once or twice attempting to sound my thoughts, and watch the expression of my countenance. He has talked of the flageolet more than once, and has, at different times, made eulogiums upon the watchfulness and ferocity of his dogs, and the regularity with which the keeper makes his rounds with a loaded fowling-piece. He mentioned even man-traps and springguns. I should be loth to affront my father's old friend in his own house; but I do long to show him that I am my father's daughter, a fact of which Mr. Mervyn will certainly be convinced if ever I trust my voice and temper with a reply to these indirect hints. Of one thing I am certain--I am grateful to him on that account--he has not told Mrs. Mervyn. Lord help me, I should have had such lectures about the dangers of love and the night air on the lake, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>arising</b> from colds and fortune-hunters, the comfort and convenience of sack-whey and closed windows! I cannot help trifling, Matilda, though my heart is sad enough. What Brown will do I cannot guess. I presume, however, the fear of detection prevents his resuming his nocturnal visits. He lodges at an inn on the opposite shore of the lake, under the name, he tells me, of Dawson; he has a bad choice in names, that must be allowed.

50|$|Beta is {{a measure}} of <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>arising</b> from {{exposure}} to general market movements as opposed to idiosyncratic factors. The market portfolio of all investable assets has a beta of exactly 1. A beta below 1 can indicate either an investment with lower volatility than the market, or a volatile investment whose price movements are not highly correlated with the market. An example of the first is a treasury bill: the price does not go up or down a lot, so it has a low beta. An example of the second is gold. The price of gold does go up and down a lot, but not in the same direction or {{at the same time as}} the market.|$|E

40|$|Newly {{introduced}} government-subsidized pension {{products in}} Germany {{are required to}} contain a promise by the seller to provide a “money-back guarantee” {{at the end of}} the term. The client is also given the right to stop paying premiums at any time (paid-up option). In this case, the amount of all premiums paid must also be guaranteed by the seller at maturity, no matter when the client stopped paying the premiums. Previous analyses of guarantees in such government-subsidized pension products have ignored this additional option. Within a generalized Black/Scholes framework, we analyze the value of the paid-up option for different products, market scenarios, and client behavior. Our results indicate that the paid-up option significantly increases the value of the money-back guarantee. Furthermore, we find that reducing volatility by shifting the client’s assets from stocks to bonds as maturity approaches is a suitable means of reducing <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>arising</b> from the “pure” money-back guarantee but much less effective in reducing <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>arising</b> from the paid-up option.

Solvency is investigated referring to immediate annuities, and hence the so-called decumulation phase is addressed. To assess solvency, assets are compared with the random present value of liabilities. Several requirements are considered, each leading to a required asset level that must be financed both with premiums (or contributions) and capital allocation. ...|$|E

But it also creates the potential for one bank’s failure to trigger off avalanches of further failures. We simulate a model of interbank lending to study the interplay of these two effects. We show that when banks are similar in size and exposure to risk, avalanche effects are small so that widening the interbank market leads to more stability. But as heterogeneity increases, avalanche effects become more important. By varying the heterogeneity and connectivity across banks, the system enters a critical regime with a power law distribution of avalanche sizes...|$|E
