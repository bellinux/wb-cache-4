50|$|Not all manual {{telephone}} exchanges were non-dialable points. Some were equipped with apparatus which displayed the called number to an operator when an outside call arrived from an automated dial exchange; this panel <b>call</b> <b>indicator</b> or coded-call indicator working {{would have made}} them dialable points from other exchanges, {{despite the absence of}} local dial.|$|R
25|$|Some {{signalling}} communicated dialed digits. An early form <b>called</b> Panel <b>Call</b> <b>Indicator</b> Pulsing used quaternary pulses {{to set up}} calls {{between a}} panel switch and a manual switchboard. Probably {{the most common form}} of communicating dialed digits between electromechanical switches was sending dial pulses, equivalent to a rotary dial's pulsing, but sent over trunk circuits between switches.|$|R
5000|$|This {{application}} {{allows the}} operator to build screen formats or menus online. Screen formats {{are very much}} like what Visual Basic and Access call [...] "forms." [...] Command keys can be enabled/disabled. Input fields, output fields, and constants can be created and conditioned. Conditions (in RPG these are <b>called</b> <b>indicators)</b> can cause fields to disappear, change colors, and so forth.|$|R

2500|$|Panel was {{installed}} in cities where many stations still used manual (non-dial) service. Calls from panel offices to manual offices required PCI (Panel <b>Call</b> <b>Indicator)</b> signals to tell the [...] "B Board Machine Incoming" [...] operator or incoming operator the phone number. The called number appeared on a lit display, enabling the operator to complete the call by plugging in the appropriate jack, and ringing the subscriber.|$|R
50|$|If {{the first}} three letters were {{capitalized}} but not bolded, e.g., HAYes 1295, the caller would dial {{the first three}} letters only, and when connected to Hayes ask the operator for the local number. Later, Coded <b>Call</b> <b>Indicator</b> working equipment was installed at some manual exchanges so that the caller could dial all seven digits, and the required number would be displayed to the operator.|$|R

This system, similar but distinct from the panel <b>call</b> <b>indicator</b> of the 1920s and automatic number identification of the 1940s, which communicated telephone numbers to machines, was the predecessor {{to what is now}} caller ID, which communicates numbers to people.|$|R

When considering zero-day, multi-step or more common attacks, the threats are identified through symptoms, <b>called</b> <b>Indicators</b> of Compromise [17 – 19] (IoC). IoC are ‘artifacts observed on a network or in an operating system that with high confidence indicates a computer intrusion’. They are best identified as anomalies with regard to the normal behaviour of a system.|$|R
50|$|Erratics, whose area {{of origin}} can be {{determined}} from their internal structure and composition, are <b>called</b> <b>indicator</b> stones. The origin {{can be determined}} by information {{in the literature on}} glacial drifts, but also determined by comparison with samples from the bedrock. For Rügen there is a Nordic Collection at the Ernst Moritz Arndt University of Greifswald. By determining the origin of these large boulders, the directions of the individual glacial streams may be determined.|$|R
30|$|In the {{following}} sections, a fundamental theory of QI-RS is introduced, where ontologies, ontology-labeled graphs and object graphs, which are special ontology-labeled graphs, are defined. Then, MSO (Section 5), quantifying concepts (Section 6) and finally graph-based representations of quality <b>indicators</b> <b>called</b> quality <b>indicator</b> graphs (Section 7) are defined. Quality indicator graphs are combinations of object graphs and quantifying concepts.|$|R

We propose a stratified sampling algorithm based on an iterative method which splits the strata following some quantities <b>called</b> <b>indicators</b> which indicate where the variance takes relative big values. The stratification method {{is based on the}} optimal allocation strategy in order to decrease the variance from iteration to another. Numerical experiments show and confirm the efficiency of our algorithm...|$|R

For those with hearing difficulties the telephone ring and conversation sound level can be amplified or pitch adjusted, ambient noise can also be filtered.

The ring can also be supplemented with extension bells or a visual <b>call</b> <b>indicator.</b>|$|R
