5|$|In 1891, W. Essex Wynter began {{treating}} <b>tubercular</b> meningitis {{by tapping}} the subarachnoid space, and Heinrich Quincke began to popularize lumbar puncture, which he advocated for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. In 1912, a neurologist William Mestrezat gave the first accurate {{description of the}} chemical composition of the CSF. In 1914, Harvey W. Cushing published conclusive evidence that the CSF is secreted by the choroid plexus.|$|E
5|$|Microbial mats {{are areas}} of {{sediment}} stabilised {{by the presence}} of colonies of microbes that secrete sticky fluids or otherwise bind the sediment particles. They appear to migrate upwards when covered by a thin layer of sediment but this is an illusion caused by the colony's growth; individuals do not, themselves, move. If too thick a layer of sediment is deposited before they can grow or reproduce through it, parts of the colony will die leaving behind fossils with a characteristically wrinkled ("elephant skin") and <b>tubercular</b> texture.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, Coward was conscripted {{into the}} Artists Rifles but was {{assessed}} as unfit for active service {{because of a}} <b>tubercular</b> tendency, and he was discharged on health grounds after nine months. That year he appeared in the D W Griffith film Hearts of the World in an uncredited role. He sold short stories to several magazines to help his family financially. He also began writing plays, collaborating {{on the first two}} (Ida Collaborates (1917) and Women and Whisky (1918)) with his friend Esmé Wynne. His first solo effort as a playwright was The Rat Trap (1918) which was eventually produced at the Everyman Theatre, Hampstead, in October 1926. During these years, he met Lorn McNaughtan, who became his private secretary and served in that capacity for more than forty years, until her death.|$|E
5|$|The {{institution}} {{of the welfare state}} was by 1957 accepted by both major parties. Diefenbaker promised to expand the national health insurance scheme to cover <b>tubercular</b> and mental health patients. He characterized the old age pension increase which the Liberal government was instituting as a mere pittance, not even enough {{to keep up with the}} cost of living. Diefenbaker noted that the increase only amounted to twenty cents a day, using that figure to ridicule Liberal contentions that an increase would add to the rate of inflation. All three opposition parties promised to increase the pension, with the Social Crediters and CCF even stating the specific amounts it would be raised by.|$|E
5|$|With Harrison's entry, the Quarrymen now {{had four}} guitarists. Lennon and McCartney {{suggested}} to Griffiths that he instead buy a bass guitar, but Griffiths refused {{because of the}} expense. The two subsequently convinced Nigel Walley, still acting as the group's manager, to fire Griffiths. Walley regretted the incident, {{and as a result}} gradually severed his ties with the Quarrymen. Around this same time, Len Garry contracted <b>tubercular</b> meningitis, and spent seven months in the hospital, never playing with the group again. This left Colin Hanton as the last of the group of Lennon's Quarry Bank classmates that originally comprised the group. In March, McCartney bought an Elpico amplifier with two inputs, and he and Harrison added pickups to their guitars, giving the Quarrymen an electric sound for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Tuberculosis {{has been}} present in humans since antiquity. The {{earliest}} unambiguous detection of M. tuberculosis involves {{evidence of the}} disease in the remains of bison in Wyoming dated to around 17,000 years ago. However, whether tuberculosis originated in bovines, then was transferred to humans, or whether it diverged from a common ancestor, is currently unclear. A comparison of the genes of M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) in humans to MTBC in animals suggests humans did not acquire MTBC from animals during animal domestication, as was previously believed. Both strains of the tuberculosis bacteria share a common ancestor, which could have infected humans even before the Neolithic Revolution. Skeletal remains show prehistoric humans (4000 BC) had TB, and researchers have found <b>tubercular</b> decay in the spines of Egyptian mummies dating from 3000–2400 BC. Genetic studies suggest TB was present in the Americas from about 100 AD.|$|E
5|$|In her research, Fraser worked {{predominantly}} in infectious disease, studying general infection, puerperal fever, {{scarlet fever}} and septic sore throat among other bacterial infections. She began studies on scarlet fever {{in the early}} 1930s, and along with Dr. Helen Plummer isolated the precipitin present in the strains of streptococci {{likely to lead to}} disease. These findings were important in determining the types of antitoxins which might be employed for immunization to neutralize the disease. The type of research Fraser was engaged in required that the bacteria of the disease which created a toxin be isolated, so that it could be injected into a horse. Repeated injections of small doses of toxin allowed the horse to become immune to the disease. The serum created from the blood of animals which had been immunized, contained an antibody (known at the time as an antitoxin), which could then be injected into humans to cure the disease. Development of the sulfonamides rendered immunization against scarlet fever unnecessary, but she continued to study other aspects of the disease. In 1941, she typed the streptococci of scarlet fever which was an important breakthrough for tracking the epidemiology of the disease. Fraser also conducted research in an attempt to develop an antigen for tuberculosis. With the development of penicillin, her research after 1947, shifted focus to the study of antibiotics including bacitracin, penicillin, polymixin, and subtilin. Fraser studied various preparations of penicillin against the <b>tubercular</b> bacillus and as a treatment for gonorrhoea. Rising through the ranks of assistant professor and associate professor, Fraser became a full professor in 1949 teaching preventative medicine for the Bachelor of Science or nursing degree for the remainder of her career. In 1955 Fraser was appointed as a professor of microbiology and held that post until her retirement a decade later.|$|E

25|$|Piedmont Sanatorium was a {{rest home}} for <b>tubercular</b> African Americans in Burkeville, Virginia from 1917 to 1965. It {{was the first}} {{facility}} of its kind ever to be established in the United States. The Sanatorium later became the site of Piedmont Geriatric Hospital.|$|E
25|$|After that, {{the team}} began to unravel, leading Kilfoyl {{to sell his}} share of the team to Somers. Cy Young, who {{returned}} to Cleveland in 1909, was ineffective for most of his three remaining years and Addie Joss died from <b>tubercular</b> meningitis prior to the 1911 season.|$|E
25|$|Steroids may be {{of benefit}} in peritonitis, miliary disease, <b>tubercular</b> osteomyelitis, TB osteomyelitis, {{laryngeal}} TB, lymphadenitis and genitourinary disease, but the evidence is scant and the routine use of steroids cannot be recommended. Steroid treatment in these patients should be considered {{on a case by}} case basis by the attending physician.|$|E
25|$|After the Spanish founded Mission San Gabriel in 1771, the Chino Hills {{was used}} {{extensively}} for grazing by mission cattle. During the Mexican Republic era, the hills {{were used as}} spillover grazing from such surrounding Mexican ranchos as Santa Ana del Chino and Rancho La Sierra (Yorba). After Mexico ceded California to the United States it was, and still is, a swamp and subject to flooding annually. Most historical dwellings were demolished {{in the rush to}} build. A local state monument is present in the grass lawn area of the local fire department, if one looks closely. Casa Colina, a well-known rehabilitation center now situated in Pomona California, began as a <b>tubercular</b> clinic in the Los Serranos sector. Similarly, the well known hospital, Loma Linda Hospital, also had its beginnings as a <b>tubercular</b> clinic. Sadly, most patients admitted for tuberculosis, succumbed to the illness because of the ineffectiveness of pre-antibotic treatments.|$|E
25|$|In 1920, after {{not hearing}} from him for several days, a {{neighbour}} checked {{on the family}} and found Modigliani in bed delirious and holding onto Hébuterne. A doctor was summoned, but little could be done because Modigliani was in {{the final stage of}} his disease, <b>tubercular</b> meningitis. He died on January 24, 1920, at the Hôpital de la Charité.|$|E
25|$|For decades, Lima {{also had}} two other {{hospitals}} with strikingly different missions. The Ottawa Valley Hospital, {{which opened in}} 1909 as the District Tuberculosis Hospital, {{was one of the}} first in the state dedicated to the treatment of <b>tubercular</b> patients. The hospital treated patients from seven to 90 years old, at a time when tuberculosis was nearly always fatal. The average stay was three to five years. As treatment improved, the hospital closed, though the building was used until 1973.|$|E
25|$|However, Richelieu was now dying. For {{many years}} he had {{suffered}} from recurrent fevers (possibly malaria), strangury, intestinal tuberculosis with fistula, and migraine. Now his right arm was suppurating with <b>tubercular</b> osteitis, and he coughed blood (after his death, his lungs {{were found to have}} extensive cavities and caseous necrosis). His doctors continued to bleed him frequently, further weakening him. As he felt his death approaching, he named Mazarin, one of his most faithful followers, to succeed him as chief minister to the King.|$|E
25|$|The wounds were {{examined}} by Luigi Romanelli, chief physician of the City Hospital of Barletta, for about one year. The physician Angelo Maria Merla {{noted that the}} wounds were not <b>tubercular</b> in origin but could not make an official diagnosis without further tests. The surgeon Giorgio Festa, a private practitioner, also examined them in 1920 and 1925. Professor Giuseppe Bastianelli, physician to Pope Benedict XV, examined the wounds, but no report of his examinations was made. Pathologist Amico Bignami of the University of Rome also observed the wounds describing them as shallow. Festa who had originally agreed with Bignami later described the wounds as superficial when covered with a scab.|$|E
25|$|Ralfs's {{father died}} at Mudeford near Christchurch before John {{was a year}} old, and the {{children}} (two sons and two daughters) were brought up at Southampton by their mother. After being educated privately he was articled to his uncle, a surgeon of Brentford, with whom he lived {{for two years and}} a half. For two years he was a pupil at Winchester Hospital, and in 1832 he passed his final examination, being specially recommended by the examiners for his knowledge of botany. For some time he practised in partnership with another surgeon at Shoreditch, and he is also said to have practised at Towcester. At Torquay, where he moved on account of lung disease (probably <b>tubercular</b> in origin), he married, in 1835, Laura Cecilia, daughter of Henry Newman. In November 1837, {{for the sake of the}} mild climate, he settled at Penzance, and, having abandoned his profession, dwelt there for the rest of his life.|$|E
500|$|This species {{blooms in}} late spring or early summer. The flowers are purple or magenta, rarely rose-pink, about [...] wide. [...] The fruits are yellowish, <b>tubercular</b> like the stems, and shaped {{something}} like the frustum of a cone, with a hollow at the wide end where the flower fell off; they are often mistaken for flowers. The plant retains them all winter. They are dry and not tasty, though the Indians of Arizona and New Mexico {{are said to have}} eaten them.|$|E
500|$|After being {{impressed}} with the Canadian West on a trip there, Egbert and {{his family moved to}} Calgary, where he established a medical practice in 1904. [...] He registered as a medical practitioner in the North-West Territories in the same year and again in 1906 after the province of Alberta entered Confederation. In addition to his medical practices, he was an active community member, serving {{as a member of the}} Calgary Board of Health, <b>Tubercular</b> Hospital Site Committee, Calgary Board of Trade and the Alberta Medical Association, where he served as president in 1921. He also established the Columbia Hospital, and served as its director.|$|E
500|$|Built in 1852, Bellamy's father {{moved the}} family {{into the house}} after its construction. [...] Bellamy {{grew up in the}} house, and {{returned}} there after completing his studies and a brief stint of work in New York City. [...] He did much of his writing (both journalistic and otherwise) in his father's study until the latter's death in 1886, after which Bellamy's family took over the entire house. [...] It was in these years that Bellamy wrote Looking Backward, the work that brought him fame. [...] His principal absences from Chicopee were made in a quest to improve his <b>tubercular</b> health, which eventually claimed his life.|$|E
500|$|A British officer (probably Pitcairn, but {{accounts}} are uncertain, {{as it may}} also have been Lieutenant William Sutherland) then rode forward, waving his sword, and called out for the assembled militia to disperse, and may also have ordered them to [...] "lay down your arms, you damned rebels!" [...] Captain Parker told his men instead to disperse and go home, but, because of the confusion, the yelling all around, and due to the raspiness of Parker's <b>tubercular</b> voice, some did not hear him, some left very slowly, and none laid down their arms. Both Parker and Pitcairn ordered their men to hold fire, but a shot was fired from an unknown source.|$|E
500|$|Fleitz {{writes in}} Shoeless: The Life and Times of Joe Jackson that Joss was {{diagnosed}} with pleurisy by the Naps team doctor while in Chattanooga. Coffey writes in 27 Men Out: Baseball's Perfect Games while on a train ride back to Toledo, Joss stopped in Cincinnati and was diagnosed by [...] "a doctor" [...] who stated Joss had [...] "congestion in his right lung with a bad attack of pleurisy" [...] and an [...] "affection [...] of the brain." [...] Kneib writes in Meningitis the Naps were scheduled to go to Cincinnati but Joss did not receive an examination until he returned to Toledo, where he was examined and diagnosed with pleurisy by his personal physician and roughly a week later, seen in Toledo by the Naps' team doctor who diagnosed Joss with <b>tubercular</b> meningitis.|$|E
500|$|The {{above-ground}} part {{consists of}} much-branched cylindrical stems, the end joints being about 3cm in diameter. The joints, unlike those of some chollas, {{are hard to}} detach. The stems are highly <b>tubercular</b> (lumpy) with a pattern of long oval lumps. A typical height is about 1 m, but exceptionally it can grow to [...] with a [...] "trunk" [...] diameter of [...] [...] The width is often similar to or somewhat greater than the height. The stems are armed with clusters of up to about 10 red to pink spines, which may be [...] long and are barbed and sharp enough to easily penetrate leather gardening gloves. The stems and fruits also have many spines or [...] "glochids" [...] about 1mm long that can detach and stick in the skin.|$|E
500|$|Upon his discharge, Colt {{spent a year}} as a {{law clerk}} for his cousin, Dudley Selden. At the same time he became a riverboat gambler and was {{challenged}} to a duel over a shared mistress. [...] Although the duel was never fought, this incident became part of Colt's backstory as a roughneck, street fighting gambler. He traveled to Vermont in 1830 as a debate coach for the University of Vermont, at Burlington; however, he left after a year due to symptoms of tuberculosis. [...] Colt then traveled to the Great Lakes to recuperate and bought a farm in Michigan on Gooden's Lake; however, <b>tubercular</b> symptoms surfaced again and he soon left for Cincinnati, Ohio, where he became a teacher of one of the first correspondence courses in America; he also became a center of a Bohemian circle, and counted John Howard Payne and Hiram Powers among his friends.|$|E
500|$|On 14 October 1909 in Paris, de Bourgoing married General Lyautey. They {{returned}} to Algeria where Lyautey maintained his division command. In 1910, they {{returned to}} France where the general took command of the Tenth Army Corps in Rennes. In 1912, the couple returned once again to North Africa where Lyautey was appointed first Resident-General of Morocco following the Treaty of Fez under which Morocco became a French protectorate. De Bourgoing {{was instrumental in the}} creation and organisation of many programmes for women and children including nurseries, kindergartens, and the first maternity center in Morocco, an exemplary institution which impressed child care specialists in France and abroad. She organised clinics in rural areas, as well as Morocco's first <b>tubercular</b> clinics and nurse training programmes. With support from the SSBM, de Bourgoing also built the Salé Convalescent Home in Salé, near Rabat, for the recovery of French and Foreign Legion soldiers together with their families, and a retirement center for the Foreign Legion near La Balme-les-Grottes in the Isère department in metropolitan France. As a result, she received the rare title of [...] "Honorary Corporal of the Foreign Legion".|$|E
500|$|Cibber replied {{mostly with}} good humour to Pope's aspersions ("some {{of which are}} in conspicuously bad taste", as Lowe points out), until 1742 when he responded in kind in [...] "A Letter from Mr. Cibber, to Mr. Pope, inquiring into the motives that might induce him in his Satyrical Works, to be so {{frequently}} fond of Mr. Cibber's name". In this pamphlet, Cibber's most effective ammunition came from a reference in Pope's Epistle to Arbuthnot (1735) to Cibber's [...] "whore", which gave Cibber a pretext for retorting in kind with a scandalous anecdote about Pope in a brothel. [...] "I must own", wrote Cibber, [...] "that I believe I know more of your whoring than you do of mine; because I don't recollect that ever I made you the least Confidence of my Amours, though I have been very near an Eye-Witness of Yours." [...] Since Pope was around four and a half feet tall and hunchbacked due to a <b>tubercular</b> infection of the spine he contracted when young, Cibber regarded the prospect of Pope with a woman as something humorous, and he speaks mockingly of the [...] "little-tiny manhood" [...] of Pope. For once the laughers were on Cibber's side, and the story [...] "raised a universal shout of merriment at Pope's expense". Pope made no direct reply, but took {{one of the most famous}} revenges in literary history. In the revised Dunciad that appeared in 1743, he changed his hero, the King of Dunces, from Lewis Theobald to Colley Cibber.|$|E

2500|$|... 1830 - While the Rohandrian monarchy totally {{disappeared}} within Anosy, {{other than}} {{in the memory of}} the Antanosy, their benefits in terms of pasture for their cattle and their best ricelands remained.

2500|$|During {{the time}} he worked for August Coelestin Just, Novalis met the 12-year-old Sophie von Kühn (1782–1797), a girl who was, {{according}} to accounts, a [...] "perfectly commonplace young girl, neither intelligent nor particularly beautiful." [...] Nonetheless, {{he fell in love}} with Sophie, since in the young Georg Philipp's view of the world [...] "nothing is commonplace" [...] because [...] "all, when rightly seen, is symbolic." [...] On 15 March 1795, when Sophie was 13 years old, the two became engaged, despite her family's reluctance and the fact that she was already <b>tubercular.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Laennec's work put him {{in contact}} with the vanguard of the French medical establishment, {{including}} Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis. Louis would go on to use statistical methods to evaluate the different aspects of the disease's progression, the efficacy of various therapies and individuals' susceptibility, publishing an article in the Annales d'hygiène publique entitled [...] "Note on the Relative Frequency of Phthisis in the Two Sexes". Another good friend and co-worker of Laennec, Gaspard Laurent Bayle, published an article in 1810 entitled Recherches sur la Pthisie Pulmonaire, in which he divided pthisis into six types: <b>tubercular</b> phthisis, glandular phthisis, ulcerous phthisis, phthisis with melanosis, calculous phthisis, and cancerous phthisis. He based his findings on more than 900 autopsies.|$|E
2500|$|She {{married the}} artist Alan Odle (1888-1948) in 1917 – a {{distinctly}} bohemian figure, {{associated with an}} artistic circle that included Augustus John, Jacob Epstein, and Wyndham Lewis. He was fifteen years younger than her, <b>tubercular</b> and an alcoholic, and was not expected to live long. However, he stopped drinking and lived until 1948. Odle was very thin and [...] "over six feet tall with waist-length hair wound around the outside of his head", which he never cut. He also rarely cut his finger nails. From 1917 until 1939, the couple spent their winters in Cornwall and their summers in London; and then stayed permanently in Cornwall until Odle’s death in 1948. She supported herself and her husband with freelance writing for periodicals for many years, as Alan made little money from his art.|$|E
2500|$|Moravia once {{remarked that}} the most {{important}} facts of his life had been his illness, a <b>tubercular</b> infection of the bones that confined him to a bed for five years and Fascism, because they both caused him to suffer and do things he otherwise would not have done. [...] "It is what we are forced to do that forms our character, not what we do of our own free will." [...] Moravia was an atheist. His writing was marked by its factual, cold, precise style, often depicting the malaise of the bourgeoisie. It was rooted in the tradition of nineteenth-century narrative, underpinned by high social and cultural awareness. Moravia believed that writers must, if they were to represent reality, [...] "assume a moral position, a clearly conceived political, social, and philosophical attitude" [...] but also that, ultimately, [...] "A writer survives in spite of his beliefs". Between 1959 and 1962 Moravia was president of PEN International, the worldwide association of writers.|$|E
