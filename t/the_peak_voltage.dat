[...] The circuit works by following a Villard cell stage with what is in essence a peak detector or envelope detector stage.

2500|$|Most Tesla coil designs have {{a smooth}} spherical or {{toroidal}} shaped metal electrode {{on the high}} voltage terminal. [...] The electrode serves as one plate of a capacitor, with the Earth as the other plate, forming the tuned circuit with the secondary winding. [...] Although the [...] "toroid" [...] increases the secondary capacitance, which tends to reduce <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>voltage,</b> its main effect is that its large diameter curved surface reduces the potential gradient (electric field) at the high voltage terminal, increasing the voltage threshold at which corona and streamer arcs form. Suppressing premature air breakdown and energy loss allows the voltage to build to higher values on the peaks of the waveform, creating longer, more spectacular streamers.|$|E
2500|$|The above {{peak voltage}} is only {{achieved}} in coils in which air discharges do not occur; in coils which produce sparks, like entertainment coils, <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>voltage</b> on the terminal {{is limited to}} the voltage at which the air breaks down and becomes conductive. [...] As the output voltage increases during each voltage pulse, it reaches the point where the air next to the high voltage terminal ionizes and coronas, brush discharges and streamer arcs, break out from the terminal. This happens when the electric field strength exceeds the dielectric strength of the air, about 30kV per centimeter. [...] Since the electric field is greatest at sharp points and edges, air discharges start at these points on the high voltage terminal. [...] The voltage on the high voltage terminal cannot increase above the air breakdown voltage, because additional electric charge pumped into the terminal from the secondary winding just escapes into the air. [...] The output voltage of open-air Tesla coils is limited to around several million volts by air breakdown, but higher voltages can be achieved by coils immersed in pressurized tanks of insulating oil.|$|E

40|$|Responsible professor: Prof. ir. L. van der Sluis The {{analysis}} of transient overvoltages in transformer windings {{is of great}} importance because the windings can suffer huge <b>peak</b> <b>voltages</b> during {{a short period of}} time. Especially transient voltages that have a very steep front, such as a lightning surge, can be dangerous for transformers and they are important for the design of the insulation. This thesis work is about computation of inter-turn voltage distributions in primary transformer windings when a high frequency surge appears at the terminal of the transformer. The objective of the study is to determine the ratio of <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> inter-turn <b>voltage</b> and <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> input <b>voltage</b> surge.

2500|$|An {{aspect of}} most {{rectification}} {{is a loss}} from <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> input <b>voltage</b> to <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> output <b>voltage,</b> caused by the built-in voltage drop across the diodes (around 0.7 V for ordinary silicon p–n junction diodes and 0.3 V for Schottky diodes). Half-wave rectification and full-wave rectification using a center-tapped secondary produces a <b>peak</b> <b>voltage</b> loss of one diode drop. Bridge rectification has a loss of two diode drops. This reduces output voltage, and limits the available output voltage if a very low alternating voltage must be rectified. As the diodes do not conduct below this voltage, the circuit only passes current through {{for a portion of}} each half-cycle, causing short segments of zero voltage (where instantaneous input voltage is below one or two diode drops) to appear between each [...] "hump".|$|R

50|$|Finally, {{depending}} upon the environmental conditions {{and the performance of}} overhead line insulation operating with HVDC, it may be possible for a given transmission line to operate with a constant HVDC voltage that is approximately the same as the peak AC voltage for which it is designed and insulated.
