40|$|The present paper {{focuses on}} {{institutional}} discourses and policies on internationalization {{and integration of}} European university system within the regulatory framework set by the Bologna Process. The Bologna Process started a process of harmonisation of the European higher education system, which has developed {{in a number of}} different directions, from promoting the European dimension of education programs. So far, European governance has been mainly driven by a top-down approach to regulation based on establishing framework policies and reference standards on European level to be implemented through national policies. The imposition of a general regulatory framework, e. g. the Bologna Process, based on standards and guidelines, is a central feature of European HER governance. At least since the seminal paper by Spence (1975), regulating quality has been a central topic in political and economic theory. The <b>typical</b> regulative <b>State</b> <b>intervention</b> in markets where there are quality issues, is to fix a minimum quality standard (MQS), which may force firms to increase provided quality. Markets with MQS are mainly concerned with food, toys, vehicles, and clothes. In these markets goods are usually produced by private firms. Moreover the education sector as well is a typical case study that is widely regulated by MQS. Note that in this market another <b>State</b> <b>intervention</b> is possible: the direct production of goods by governments, i. e. the competition between a public and a private firm in a mixed oligopoly framework. The paper aims at analysing both theoretically and empirically the effect of European policies and discourses on High Education and Research using as a framework MQS analysis. European HER governance will be discussed as being drafted through a competitive-oriented discourse on knowledge production and transmission, tending to establish a unified scientific area according to market regulation policies and neoliberal principles.

40|$|This article {{attempts}} {{to develop some}} of the basic elements for a theory of <b>state</b> <b>intervention</b> in medical care. First, a typology of <b>state</b> <b>intervention</b> is proposed based on two dimensions: the form of state control over the production of medical services and the basis for eligibility of the population. The resulting twelve types provide a means of describing national patterns of <b>state</b> <b>intervention</b> at a given point in time. Next, in order to analyse the changing patterns of <b>state</b> <b>intervention</b> in medical care over time, changes in state control and population coverage are used to construct three hypothetical 'paths' of <b>state</b> <b>intervention,</b> which may serve to depict broad historical trends in major groups of countries. In the final section, several variables are analysed according to their expected effect on the patterns of convergence and divergence in the form and degree of <b>state</b> <b>intervention</b> between countries. This cross-national comparative perspective is offered as a strategy for building a theory capable of explaining <b>state</b> <b>intervention,</b> a process that, to a large extent, informs the medical experience of today...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} three developmental {{regimes in}} Singapore, China and Malaysia. In these three cases, heavy <b>state</b> <b>intervention</b> was necessary because their economies required significant economic restructuring. For Singapore, <b>state</b> <b>intervention</b> {{was necessary for}} the process of industrial transformation. For Malaysia, <b>state</b> <b>intervention</b> was necessary because the government wanted to reallocate economic resources {{as a means to}} deal with ethnic conflict. For China, <b>state</b> <b>intervention</b> was necessary in order to gradually “marketize” the socialist economy. The paper also briefly discusses the impact of the Asian Financial Crisis (1997 - 1999) on these developmental regimes. It finds that for all three cases, economic restructuring was successful because of long-term and heavy <b>state</b> <b>intervention.</b> It explains that, unlike the other developmental states of Asia, these developmental regimes were able to undertake such significant restructuring because of the state's power base, which even managed to survive the Asian Financial Crisis. It concludes with some comments about the future of <b>state</b> <b>intervention</b> in a rapidly globalizing world. Singapore, Malaysia, China, developmental regimes, interventionist states,...|$|R
40|$|I offer {{a simple}} {{framework}} to address why <b>state</b> <b>intervention</b> {{in the financial}} system, prevalent in less developed economies, yields various welfare outcomes, and why such conventional reforms as privatization and fiscal reforms prove insufficient to eliminate <b>state</b> <b>intervention.</b> In the model three institutional factors are in play: 1) control rights over financial institutions; 2) cash-flow rights of the private over financial institutions; 3) monitoring capability of the public on tax/resource collection by the state. Based on the model, I show that <b>state</b> <b>intervention</b> can be developmental or derogatory depending on institutional traits including degree of privatization and monitoring capability of the public over the tax collection by the state. Further I illustrate {{that as long as}} state has control rights, conventional reforms such as fiscal reform and privatization may not be enough in eliminating <b>state</b> <b>intervention</b> in the financial system. <b>State</b> <b>Intervention,</b> Financial System, Control Rights, Privatization, Fiscal Reform...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} pauperism in Rome, {{as in the}} rest of Europe, between the 16 th and the 18 th centuries, was very important. In the city of the popes it was not only a matter of {{ensuring}} the proper management of the State but also the repose of society through the public organization of succors and their control by the political power. To this end, a publication in 1693 (Istituzioni e regole degli Ospizi generali per li poveri da fondarsi nello Stato Ecclesiastico di ordine della Santità di Nostro Signore Papa Innocenzo XII, Roma 1693) reveals that the authorities were aware that regulating charitable institutions was not enough without a firm commitment to making these institutions operate effectively to help the poor. It was in the years between 1686 and 1692 that Tommaso Odescalchi sheltered the poor and destitute children of Rome in the house of San Michele; the State’s effort in the Ospizio Apostolico, however, was costly. This led the pontiff to authorize the Ospizio to raise funds from other sources, such as the so-called censi vitalizi. As to the other type of extraordinary financing, the “Monte vacabile dell’Ospizio Apostolico”, the Papal Government was able to inspire confidence in potential subscribers by promptly paying interest and repaying the principal. Then, the public debt, which was ably managed by the papal authorities, {{turned out to be the}} most effective tool for raising substantial resources, and in a rather short time frame, to meet the growing financing requirements. In addition to this, the establishment of the Monte dell’Ospizio Apostolico is a <b>typical</b> case of <b>state</b> <b>intervention</b> in its economic life...|$|R

Beyond the old free market vis-à-vis <b>state</b> <b>intervention</b> debate, after reviewing related theories, this study examines the contingent nature of <b>state</b> <b>intervention</b> affecting business group performance {{in the context of}} transition economy by identifying different modes of <b>state</b> <b>intervention</b> in China's transitional economy. Using the data on China's 76 business groups collected in 2006, and methods such as logistic regression model, OLS regression model, and MIMIC model, the study finds that, at the group level, modes of <b>state</b> <b>intervention</b> have different economic effects on business group performance, depending on the specific modes of intervention and the context of institutional environment in China's transitional economy. Through direct intervention such as ownership and officials and Chinese Communist Party members at the group level, state failed to provide positive economic effects. In other words, these kinds of modes of <b>state</b> <b>interventions</b> make business group perform less well economically in current China's institutional context. However, the result demonstrates the state ability to provide positive economic effects by matching the functional demands of market in the emerging market such as loans from state-controlled banks as financial support. The interaction effects of party control and financial support further confirms that, with the increase of financial support from the state, high party control dramatically reduces the probability of high group performance comparing with how party control.
