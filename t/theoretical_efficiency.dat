25|$|Isothermal {{compression}} and expansion approaches attempt to maintain operating temperature by constant heat exchange to the environment. They are only practical for low power levels, without very effective heat exchangers. The <b>theoretical</b> <b>efficiency</b> of isothermal energy storage approaches 100% for perfect heat {{transfer to the}} environment. In practice neither of these perfect thermodynamic cycles is obtainable, as some heat losses are unavoidable.|$|E
25|$|Further inefficiencies, such as gearbox losses, {{generator}} and converter losses, {{reduce the}} power delivered by a wind turbine. To protect components from undue wear, extracted power is held constant above the rated operating speed as theoretical power increases at the cube of wind speed, further reducing <b>theoretical</b> <b>efficiency.</b> In 2001, commercial utility-connected turbines deliver 75% to 80% of the Betz limit of power extractable from the wind, at rated operating speed.|$|E

25|$|Dye sensitised {{solar cells}} {{operate as a}} photoanode (n-DSC), where {{photocurrent}} result from electron injection by the sensitized dye. Photocathodes (p-DSCs) operate in an inverse mode compared to the conventional n-DSC, where dye-excitation is followed by rapid electron transfer from a p-type semiconductor to the dye (dye-sensitized hole injection, instead of electron injection). Such p-DSCs and n-DSCs can be combined to construct tandem solar cells (pn-DSCs) and the <b>theoretical</b> <b>efficiency</b> of tandem DSCs is well beyond that of single-junction DSCs.|$|E
25|$|To summarize, the Stirling engine {{uses the}} {{temperature}} difference between its hot end and cold end {{to establish a}} cycle of a fixed mass of gas, heated and expanded, and cooled and compressed, thus converting thermal energy into mechanical energy. The greater the temperature difference between the hot and cold sources, the greater the thermal efficiency. The maximum <b>theoretical</b> <b>efficiency</b> is equivalent {{to that of the}} Carnot cycle, but the efficiency of real engines is less than this value because of friction and other losses.|$|E
25|$|Adiabatic storage {{continues}} {{to keep the}} heat produced by compression and returns it to the air as it is expanded to generate power. This is a subject of ongoing study, with no utility scale plants as of 2015, but a German project ADELE is planning to bring a demonstration plant (360MWh storage capacity) into service in 2016. The <b>theoretical</b> <b>efficiency</b> of adiabatic storage approaches 100% with perfect insulation, but in practice round trip efficiency {{is expected to be}} 70%. Heat can be stored in a solid such as concrete or stone, or more likely in a fluid such as hot oil (up to 300°C) or molten salt solutions (600°C).|$|E
50|$|Another, more {{straightforward}} way to utilise multiple exciton {{generation is}} a process called singlet fission (or singlet exciton fission) by which a singlet exciton is converted into two triplet excitons of lower energy. This allows for higher <b>theoretical</b> <b>efficiencies</b> when coupled to a low bandgap semiconductor and quantum efficiencies exceeding 100% have been reported.|$|R
40|$|The Department of Energy is {{studying}} alternative heat pumping technologies to identify possible cost effective alternatives to electric driven vapor compression heat pumps, air conditioners, and chillers {{that could help}} reduce CO{sub 2 } emissions. Over thirty different technologies are being considered including: engine driven systems, fuel cell powered systems, and alternative cycles. Results presented include <b>theoretical</b> <b>efficiencies</b> for all systems as well as measured performance of some commercial, prototype, or experimental systems. <b>Theoretical</b> <b>efficiencies</b> show that the alternative electric-driven technologies would have HSPFs between 4 and 8 Btu/Wh (1. 2 to 2. 3 W/W) and SEERs between 3 and 9. 5 Btu/Wh (0. 9 and 2. 8 W/W). Gas-fired heat pump technologies have theoretical seasonal heating gCOPs from 1. 1 to 1. 7 and cooling gCOPs from 0. 95 to 1. 6 (a SEER 12 Btu/Wh electric air conditioner has a primary energy efficiency of approximately 1. 4 W/W) ...|$|R

25|$|The second easiest {{reaction}} is to fuse deuterium with itself. Because of its low cost, deuterium {{is commonly used}} by Fusor amateurs. Bussard's polywell experiments were performed using this fuel. Fusion of deuterium or tritium produces a fast neutron, and therefore produces radioactive waste. Bussard's choice was to fuse boron-11 with protons; this {{reaction is}} aneutronic (does not produce neutrons). An advantage of p-11B as a fusion fuel is that the primary reactor output would be energetic alpha particles, which can be directly converted to electricity at high efficiency using direct energy conversion. Direct conversion has achieved a 48% power efficiency against 80–90% <b>theoretical</b> <b>efficiency.</b>|$|E
25|$|Watt's next {{improvement}} to the Newcomen {{design was}} {{to seal the}} top of the cylinder and surround the cylinder with a jacket. Steam was passed through the jacket before being admitted below the piston, keeping the piston and cylinder warm to prevent condensation within it. The second improvement was the utilisation of steam expansion against the vacuum {{on the other side of}} the piston. The steam supply was cut during the stroke, and the steam expanded against the vacuum on the other side. This increased the efficiency of the engine, but also created a variable torque on the shaft which was undesirable for many applications, in particular pumping. Watt therefore limited the expansion to a ratio of 1:2 (i.e. the steam supply was cut at half stroke). This increased the <b>theoretical</b> <b>efficiency</b> from 6.4% to 10.6%, with only a small variation in piston pressure. Watt did not use high pressure steam because of safety concerns.|$|E
25|$|The {{theoretical}} maximum {{efficiency of}} any type of power generation system is never reached in practice, {{and it does not}} consider other steps in power generation, such as production, transportation and storage of fuel and conversion of the electricity into mechanical power. However, this calculation allows the comparison of different types of power generation. The maximum theoretical energy efficiency of a fuel cell is 83%, operating at low power density and using pure hydrogen and oxygen as reactants (assuming no heat recapture) According to the World Energy Council, this compares with a maximum <b>theoretical</b> <b>efficiency</b> of 58% for internal combustion engines. While these efficiencies are not approached in most real world applications, high-temperature fuel cells (solid oxide fuel cells or molten carbonate fuel cells) can theoretically be combined with gas turbines to allow stationary fuel cells to come closer to the theoretical limit. A gas turbine would capture heat from the fuel cell and turn it into mechanical energy to increase the fuel cell's operational efficiency. This solution has been predicted to increase total efficiency to as much as 80%.|$|E
50|$|Lowering {{operating}} temperatures has the {{added benefit of}} increased <b>efficiency.</b> <b>Theoretical</b> fuel cell <b>efficiency</b> increases with decreasing temperature. For example, the efficiency of a SOFC using CO as fuel increases from 63% to 81% when decreasing the system temperature from 900 °C to 350 °C.|$|R

5000|$|Two longer range {{investigations}} into high efficiency solar cells was undertaken. 1) [...] "Rainbow" [...] cells to {{be tailored to}} the wavelengths of specific ranges of sunlight focused through a prism. 2) An ensemble of quantum dots in a size range to capture most of the radiation from the solar energy spectrum. The collection would be equivalent to an array of semiconductors individually size tuned for optimal absorption at their bandgaps throughout the solar energy emission spectrum. <b>Theoretical</b> <b>efficiencies</b> were {{in the range of}} 50-70%.|$|R
2500|$|One of {{the main}} offerings of a {{hydrogen}} economy is that the fuel can replace the fossil fuel burned in internal combustion engines and turbines as the primary way to convert chemical energy into kinetic or electrical energy; hereby eliminating greenhouse gas emissions and pollution from that engine. [...] Although hydrogen {{can be used in}} conventional internal combustion engines, fuel cells, being electrochemical, have a <b>theoretical</b> <b>efficiency</b> advantage over heat engines. Fuel cells are more expensive to produce than common internal combustion engines.|$|E
2500|$|The Expansion Engine {{can offer}} {{significant}} advantages here, in particular for lower power ratings of 2 to 100kW: with expansion ratios of 1:5, the <b>theoretical</b> <b>efficiency</b> reaches 15%, {{which is in}} the range of ORC systems. The Expansion Engine uses water as working fluid which is simple, cheap, not toxic, nonflammable and not corrosive. It works at pressure near and below atmospheric. So that sealing is not a problem. And it is a simple machine, implying cost effectiveness. Researchers from the University of Southampton / UK are currently developing a modern version of Watt's engine in order to generate energy from waste steam and waste heat. They improved the theory, demonstrating that theoretical efficiencies of up to 17.4% (and actual efficiencies of 11%) are possible.|$|E
2500|$|Normal {{photovoltaic}} systems however {{have only one}} p-n junction and are therefore subject to a lower efficiency limit, called the [...] "ultimate efficiency" [...] by Shockley and Queisser. Photons with an energy below the band gap of the absorber material cannot generate an electron-hole pair, so their energy is not converted to useful output, and only generates heat if absorbed. For photons with an energy above the band gap energy, {{only a fraction of}} the energy above the band gap can be converted to useful output. When a photon of greater energy is absorbed, the excess energy above the band gap is converted to kinetic energy of the carrier combination. The excess kinetic energy is converted to heat through phonon interactions as the kinetic energy of the carriers slows to equilibrium velocity. Traditional single-junction cells have a maximum <b>theoretical</b> <b>efficiency</b> of 33.16%.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Theoretical</b> power <b>efficiency</b> of class-D {{amplifiers}} is 100%. That is to say, all of {{the power}} supplied to it is delivered to the load, none is turned to heat. This is because an ideal switch in its on state would conduct all the current but have no voltage loss across it, hence no heat would be dissipated. And when it is off, it would have the full supply voltage across it but no leak current flowing through it, and again no heat would be dissipated. Real-world power MOSFETs are not ideal switches, but practical efficiencies well over 90% are common. By contrast, linear AB-class amplifiers are always operated with both current flowing through and voltage standing across the power devices. An ideal class-B amplifier has a <b>theoretical</b> maximum <b>efficiency</b> of 78%. Class A amplifiers (purely linear, with the devices always [...] "on") have a <b>theoretical</b> maximum <b>efficiency</b> of 50% and some versions have efficiencies below 20%.|$|R
40|$|<b>Theoretical</b> thermal <b>efficiencies</b> and <b>theoretical</b> effectivenesses of six {{kinds of}} basic gas cycles, {{including}} the Carnot, Otto, Diesel, Takemura, Atkinson and Joule cycles, {{were compared with}} one another under the restriction of constant heat-addition. Relations between the available work content of heat added and the exergy change in several thermodynamic processes were also examined. It is concluded that the Atkinson cycle has the highest thermal efficiency and the second best effectiveness among the gas cycles examined. The exergy changes in an isochoric heating-process in closed systems and in an isobaric heating-process in open systems agree with the available work contents of heat added in these processes. Thus, the exergy increment in a heating process should not be generally adopted as the denominator for the theoretical effectiveness. <b>Theoretical</b> thermal <b>efficiency</b> <b>Theoretical</b> effectiveness Gas cycles Constant heat addition Available energy Exergy change...|$|R

6000|$|All this {{elaboration}} of warfare lengthens the scale between <b>theoretical</b> <b>efficiency</b> and absolute unpreparedness. There {{was a time}} when any tribe that had men and spears was ready for war, and any tribe that had some cunning or emotion at command might hope to discount any little disparity in numbers between itself and its neighbour. Luck and stubbornness and the incalculable counted for much; it was half the battle not to know you were beaten, and it is so still. Even to-day, a great nation, it seems, may still make its army the plaything of its gentlefolk, abandon important military appointments to feminine intrigue, and trust cheerfully to the homesickness and essential modesty of its influential people, and the simpler patriotism of its colonial dependencies when it comes at last to the bloody and wearisome business of [...] "muddling through." [...] But these days of the happy-go-lucky optimist are near their end. War is being drawn into the field of the exact sciences. Every additional weapon, every new complication of the art of war, intensifies the need of deliberate preparation, and darkens the outlook of a nation of amateurs. Warfare in the future, on sea or land alike, will be much more one-sided than it has ever been in the past, much more of a foregone conclusion. Save for national lunacy, it will be brought about by the side that will win, and because that side knows that it will win. More and more it will have the quality of surprise, of pitiless revelation. Instead of the seesaw, the bickering interchange of battles of the old time, will come swiftly and amazingly blow, and blow, and blow, no pause, no time for recovery, disasters cumulative and irreparable.|$|E
