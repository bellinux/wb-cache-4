By late 1988, Ken Gormly had joined on bass guitar and James Cruickshank on {{keyboards}} and guitars. In 1989, the band invited vocalist Tex Perkins, {{also a member of}} Beasts of Bourbon, to join them on-stage. The group signed with Red Eye Records and released their debut album, Down Below, in December. Their second album, <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Not</b> <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> Home was issued in December 1991.|$|E

The previously mentioned study published in the American Heart Journal indicated that some of the intercessors who took part in it complained about the scripted nature of the prayers that were imposed to them, saying that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they usually conduct prayer: ...|$|E
2500|$|A single, [...] "I Feel" [...] was {{released}} in September 1991 ahead of their second album, <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Not</b> <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> Home issued in December. It was produced by Tony Cohen (The Birthday Party, Beasts of Bourbon) and The Cruel Sea. The album provided a range of music [...] "from funky Louisiana swamp blues to sweet soul". Vocals by Perkins were compared with Captain Beefheart, John Lee Hooker and Tony Joe White. An EP, 4 x 4, followed in March 1992 with [...] "This Is Not the Way Home" [...] released as a single in August. After the album's release, the band toured Europe in support of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. In December they released, [...] "Black Stick" [...] as a single, which peaked at No.25 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Singles Chart. <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Not</b> <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> received a nomination for 'Best Group' at the ARIA Music Awards of 1993.|$|E

2500|$|When members {{apparently}} cried, Jones counseled, [...] "Stop these hysterics. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> {{for people}} who are socialists or communists to die. No way for us to die. We must die with some dignity." [...] Jones can be heard saying, [...] "Don't be afraid to die", that death is [...] "just stepping over into another plane" [...] and that it's [...] "a friend". At the end of the tape, Jones concludes: [...] "We didn't commit suicide; we committed an act of revolutionary suicide protesting the conditions of an inhumane world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jones {{moved to}} London and {{enrolled}} at William Shipley's drawing school in November 1761. Despite attending the life class at St Martin's Lane Academy, he remained unconfident {{of his ability}} to draw figures convincingly, and in 1763 he persuaded the leading landscape painter of the day (and fellow Welshman) Richard Wilson to take him on as a pupil. A high-spirited youth, Jones recorded in his journal that he and two rowdy fellow pupils were once rebuked by their master with the words, [...] "Gentlemen, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to rival Claude".|$|E
2500|$|In a {{briefing}} to the Board of Governors on this report in early September 2012, IAEA Deputy Director General Herman Nackaerts and Assistant Director General Rafael Grossi displayed satellite images for its member states which allegedly demonstrate Iranian efforts to remove incriminating evidence from its facility at Parchin, or a [...] "nuclear clean-up." [...] These images showed a building at Parchin covered in {{what appeared to}} be a pink tarpaulin, as well as demolition of building and removal of earth that the IAEA said would [...] "significantly hamper" [...] its investigation. [...] A senior Western diplomat described the presentation as [...] "pretty compelling." [...] The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) said that the purpose of the pink tarpaulin could be to hide further [...] "clean-up work" [...] from satellites. [...] However, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, Iran's envoy to the IAEA, denied the contents of the presentation, saying that [...] "merely having a photo from up there, a satellite imagery ... <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the agency should do its professional job." ...|$|E

2500|$|Martin Horwood, MP for Cheltenham, Sandiford's {{most recent}} UK residence, {{expressed}} his shock at the sentence. [...] "The {{days of the}} death penalty ought to be past. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that a country that now values democracy and human rights should really be behaving." [...] The sentence was also condemned by the anti–death penalty charity Reprieve, which has taken up her case. The organisation's Harriet McCulloch said, [...] "She is clearly not a drug king pin - she has no money to pay for a lawyer, for the travel costs of defence witnesses or even for essentials like food and water. She has cooperated fully with the Indonesian authorities but has been sentenced to death while the gang operating in the UK, Thailand and Indonesia remain free to target other vulnerable people." [...] Tim Hancock, Campaigns Director of Amnesty International UK also criticised the sentence. [...] "It is extremely sad to hear that judges have decided to give Lindsay Sandiford a death sentence – {{despite the fact that the}} prosecution weren't even asking for it. She is the second British citizen sentenced to death for drug offences in the last six months – an extremely worrying trend." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{first article}} criticising {{practical}} Zionism, called [...] "Lo ze haderekh" [...] (<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way)</b> published in 1888 appeared in HaMelitz. In it, {{he wrote that}} the Land of Israel will not be capable of absorbing all of the Jewish Diaspora, not even a majority of them. [...] Ahad Ha'am also argued that establishing a [...] "national home" [...] in Zion will not solve the [...] "Jewish problem"; furthermore, the physical conditions in Eretz Yisrael will discourage Aliyah, and thus Hibbat Zion must educate and strengthen Zionist values among the Jewish people enough that they will want to settle the land despite the greatest difficulties. [...] The ideas in this article became the platform for Bnei Moshe Sor (sons of Moses), a group he founded that year. B'nei Moshe Sor, active until 1897, worked to improve Hebrew education, build up a wider audience for Hebrew literature, and assist the Jewish settlements. [...] Perhaps more significant was Derekh Kehayim (1889), Ha'am's attempt to launch a unique movement from a fundamentalist perspective incorporating {{all the elements of}} a national revival, but driven by force of intellect.|$|E
