5|$|By contrast, ovarian cancer, {{the leading}} cause of {{reproductive}} organ cancer deaths, and the fifth commonest cause of cancer deaths in women in the United States, lacks an effective screening programme, and is predominantly a disease of women in industrialised countries. Because it is largely asymptomatic in its earliest stages, more than 50% of women have stage III or higher cancer (spread beyond the ovaries) by the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> diagnosed, with a consequent poor prognosis.|$|E
5|$|Friends with Benefits is a 2011 American {{romantic comedy}} film {{directed}} by Will Gluck, and starring Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis {{in the lead}} roles. The film features Patricia Clarkson, Jenna Elfman, Bryan Greenberg, Nolan Gould, Richard Jenkins, and Woody Harrelson in supporting roles. The plot revolves around Dylan Harper (Timberlake) and Jamie Rellis (Kunis), who meet in New York City, and naively believe adding sex to their friendship will not lead to complications. Over time, they begin to develop deep mutual feelings for each other, only to deny it each <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> together.|$|E

5|$|Most lionesses {{will have}} {{reproduced}} by the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{four years of}} age. Lions do not mate at any specific time of year, and the females are polyestrous. As with other cats' penises, the male lion's penis has spines that point backward. During withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake {{the walls of the}} female's vagina, which may cause ovulation. A lioness may mate with more than one male when she is in heat.|$|E
5|$|Orangutans build nests {{specialized}} {{for both}} {{day or night}} use. These are carefully constructed; young orangutans learn from observing their mother's nest-building behaviour. In fact, nest-building is a leading cause in young orangutans leaving their mother for the first time. From six months of age onwards, orangutans practice nest-building and gain proficiency by the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> three years old.|$|E

5|$|Birds forage singly or {{in pairs}} in summer, {{and more often}} in larger flocks in autumn and winter, during which <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> more likely to loiter around people and urban areas. They {{occasionally}} associate with Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen) or common starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) when foraging. Birds have also been encountered with grey currawongs (S.versicolor) and satin bowerbirds (Ptilinorhynchus violaceus). The species has been reported stealing food from other birds such as the Australian hobby (Falco longipennis), collared sparrowhawk (Accipiter cirrocephalus), and sulphur-crested cockatoo (Cacatua galerita). Pied currawongs will also harass each other. A 2007 study conducted by researchers from the Australian National University showed that white-browed scrubwren (Sericornis frontalis) nestlings became silent {{when they heard the}} recorded sound of a pied currawong walking through leaf litter.|$|E
5|$|Blacktip reef sharks have {{extremely}} small home ranges and exhibit strong site fidelity, remaining {{within the same}} local area for up to several years at a <b>time.</b> <b>They</b> <b>are</b> active predators of small bony fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans, and have also been known to feed on sea snakes and seabirds. Accounts of the blacktip reef shark's life history have been variable and sometimes contradictory, in part reflecting geographical differences within the species. Like other members of its family, this shark is viviparous, with females giving birth to two to five young on a biennial, annual, or possibly biannual cycle. Reports of the gestation period range from 7–9, through 10–11, to possibly 16 months. Mating is preceded by the male following closely behind the female, likely attracted by her chemical signals. Newborn sharks are found further inshore and in shallower water than adults, frequently roaming in large groups over areas flooded by high tide.|$|E

5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} by the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> a year old. Females enter oestrus (typically five days long) from January to March. In males, {{spermatogenesis}} occurs mainly in February and March. In southern Turkmenistan, mating occurs from January to early February. The mating season {{is marked by}} noisy fights among males for dominance. Mating behaviour {{is similar to that}} in the domestic cat: the male pursues the female in oestrus, seizes her by {{the nape of her neck}} and mounts her. Vocalisations and flehmen are prominent during courtship. After a successful copulation, the female gives out a loud cry and reacts with aversion towards her partner. The pair then separate.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} by the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> a year old; {{production}} of gametes begins even earlier at seven to ten months. However, successful mating takes place only at 12 to 15 months. Breeding takes place throughout the year. Oestrus, {{one to three}} days long, recurs every two weeks unless the female is pregnant. Females in oestrus show a spike in urine-marking, and form temporary pairs with males. Mating has not been extensively studied; limited number of observations suggest that copulation, that lasts nearly four minutes on an average, begins with the male smelling the areas urine-marked by the female, who rolls on the ground. Following this he approaches and mounts the female. The pair separate after copulation.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the males}} and females become sexually mature by the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> a year-and-a-half old. However, males {{actually}} mate {{after the age of}} four to five years. Males and females are most reproductive till the age of 14 and 14–18 years, respectively, with the maximum age of successful lactation in females being 13–14 years. With no fixed breeding season; births may occur at any time of the year. A study at Dvůr Králové Zoo (Czech Republic) showed that 55% of the births occurred between September and December. A rutting male tests the urine of any female he encounters, to which the female responds by urinating. Having located a female in estrus, the male follows her closely, trying to rub his cheek on her rump, head, neck, and chest. He performs gasping movements with his lips. Finally, the male mounts the female, resting his head and neck on her back, in a similar way as other tragelaphines.|$|E

5|$|In the {{majority}} of species of caecilians, the young are produced by vivipary. Typhlonectes compressicauda, a species from South America, is typical of these. Up to nine larvae can develop in the oviduct at any one <b>time.</b> <b>They</b> <b>are</b> elongated and have paired sac-like gills, small eyes and specialised scraping teeth. At first, they feed on the yolks of the eggs, but as this source of nourishment declines they begin to rasp at the ciliated epithelial cells that line the oviduct. This stimulates the secretion of fluids rich in lipids and mucoproteins on which they feed along with scrapings from the oviduct wall. They may increase their length sixfold and be two-fifths {{as long as their}} mother before being born. By this time they have undergone metamorphosis, lost their eyes and gills, developed a thicker skin and mouth tentacles, and reabsorbed their teeth. A permanent set of teeth grow through soon after birth.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are sexually}} mature by the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> a year old, though {{successful}} mating generally occurs only after four years. Mature males start establishing territories {{and try to}} gain access to females. Females can conceive after they are {{a year and a half}} old; oestrus lasts for 24 to 48 hours, and occurs every 12–29 days in non-pregnant females. The annual three-week-long rut (breeding season) begins toward the end of the wet season, typically in May. Gonadal growth and hormone production in males begin a few months before the breeding season, resulting in greater aggressiveness and territoriality. The bulbourethral glands are heavier, testosterone levels are nearly twice as high in territorial males as in bachelors, and the neck of a territorial male tends to be thicker than that of a bachelor during the rut. Mating tends to take place between full moons.|$|E
5|$|Newly hatched chicks {{are covered}} with whitish down, and are blind and largely {{helpless}} (nidicolous). Their eyes begin to open on day 6 and are fully open by day 15. The juvenile feathers begin growing through the down from days 7 to 10, covering the baby owls by two weeks of age. Their mother broods them continuously for the first week, then in the day only until the third week. Her partner brings food to the nest, which she tears into pieces before feeding the nestlings. The young vomit up pellets and defecate in the nest, which becomes quite smelly. They leave the nest five to six weeks after hatching, by which <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> fully feathered, with downy head and underparts and short tails. The tail reaches its adult length by 65 to 70 days. Young boobooks lose the remainder of their downy feathers by around five months of age.|$|E

5|$|Three {{types of}} {{influenza}} viruses affect people, called Type A, Type B, and Type C. Usually, {{the virus is}} spread through the air from coughs or sneezes. This is believed to occur mostly over relatively short distances. It can also be spread by touching surfaces contaminated by the virus and then touching the mouth or eyes. A person may be infectious to others both {{before and during the}} <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> showing symptoms. The infection may be confirmed by testing the throat, sputum, or nose for the virus. A number of rapid tests are available; however, people may still have the infection if the results are negative. A type of polymerase chain reaction that detects the virus's RNA is more accurate.|$|E
5|$|Typically diurnal, {{the jungle}} cat hunts {{throughout}} the day. Solitary in nature, jungle cats do not interact appreciably {{except in the}} mating season. The only prominent interaction is the mother-kitten bond. Territories are maintained by urine spraying and scent marking. The cat is primarily a carnivore, and prefers small mammals (gerbils, hares and rodents) and birds. It hunts by stalking its prey, followed by a sprint or a leap; the sharp ears help in pinpointing the location of prey. Both sexes become sexually mature by the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> a year old; females enter oestrus from January to March. Mating behaviour {{is similar to that}} in the domestic cat: the male pursues the female in oestrus, seizes her by {{the nape of her neck}} and mounts her. Gestation lasts nearly two months. Births take place between December and June, though this might vary geographically. Kittens begin to catch their own prey at around six months and leave the mother after eight or nine months.|$|E
