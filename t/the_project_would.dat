5|$|Despite {{concerns}} {{raised by}} Crozier in 2006 that <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>would</b> be halted {{after the first}} phase, which were dismissed at the time, no further work has actually been completed on the Essex Bypass since 2012, and the section between Essex and Ruthven remains a two lane highway. It is still considered as a future project by the MTO, with no time line set.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} letter, Gruening also {{promoted}} {{the possibility of}} the dam creating a thriving tourism industry in Interior Alaska, a hypothesis that was raised by other dam supporters as well. Greuning stated that <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>would</b> be similar to Lake Powell, in that it would create a range of recreational activities, including water skiing and picnicking.|$|E

5|$|On April 30, 2008, the FTA {{reversed}} the earlier decision and approved the above-ground project, {{saying that it}} met standards for cost efficiency, construction and ridership, moving it closer to receiving the $900 million in federal funding. Officials told The Washington Post that <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>would</b> move into the final design stage. The FTA approved funding for the project on December 4, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Support for the dam project {{came from}} a variety of sources, but {{supporters}} tended to use three primary arguments in favor of its construction: the electricity generated by <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>would</b> be cheap and plentiful, industries would be attracted to Alaska by the cheap electricity, and the dam's construction would have minimal impact on the environment and human populations.|$|E
5|$|A slip ramp {{was also}} planned in 2000 {{to connect to}} Lafayette Street in Norristown {{as part of a}} {{revitalization}} plan for the community. <b>The</b> <b>project</b> <b>would</b> involve extending Lafayette Street to the new ramp. This proposed slip ramp is projected to cost $160 million. Montgomery County officials have proposed a surcharge for the new exit in {{to help pay for the}} project. Work on engineering and environmental approval for the interchange occurred in 2008, and acquisition of land began in 2011. On January 7, 2015, the turnpike commission committed $45 million to building this interchange. Construction on the interchange at Lafayette Street may begin as soon as 2018.|$|E

5|$|After leaving Apogee, Jackson {{entered into}} {{a joint venture with}} Clair Brothers to design a digital {{loudspeaker}} controller for control of complex concert sound systems. Jackson estimated that <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>would</b> cost $800,000 in U.S. dollars, but it ended up costing Clair Brothers more than $2M. From the same garage in which he started Apogee, Jackson developed the proprietary Clair iO: a two-input, six-output digital audio matrix with opto-isolated output circuits. An essential element of the system was its ability to be controlled by wireless tablet computer by an audio engineer walking around to various seating sections in a concert venue, to tailor the system's response more precisely.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the release}} of Ace, Cascade Games was infamous for their Cassette 50 (1983) game {{compilation}} that featured simplistic and subpar games. Stevens points out that without the income from the compilation, <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>would</b> not have been possible. The developers estimate the production cost of Ace at £40k. Following {{the release of}} Ace, Cascade moved into mainstream AAA game development. Wilhelmy says that Cascade boasted over a million GBP in turnover over the following years. The company produced two sequels, Ace 2 (1987) and ACE 2088 (1989), and various other games before closing down in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Christopher McQuarrie, {{who went}} uncredited {{for his work}} on X-Men, was hired to write the {{screenplay}} for the second Wolverine film in August 2009. Darren Aronofsky was chosen to direct the film, though bowed out, stating <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>would</b> keep him out of the country for too long. James Mangold was later chosen to direct the film. Mark Bomback was then hired to rewrite McQuarrie's script. Principal photography began in August 2012 in Sydney, Australia, and ended in November.

5|$|Crytek then {{pitched the}} game to {{different}} publishers, and eventually, in 2009, the company pitched the two projects to Microsoft. According to Nick Button-Brown, the general manager at Crytek, the game was not functional at that time, and only served {{to prove to the}} publisher that a first-person melee game was fun for players. The representative from Microsoft, Phil Spencer, admired Crytek's intention to expand, and thought that Microsoft's games line up for the Xbox 360 was lacking a first-person melee-combat game. As a result, they accepted to publish Kingdoms, and rejected Kings. The two companies agreed that <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>would</b> be a natural fit for Microsoft's yet-to-be-announced Kinect.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, The Guardian {{reported}} on concerns regarding {{funding for the}} Tablighi Jamaat's construction project. Documentation filed with the Charity Commission indicated that 's annual donations {{were in the order}} of only £500,000, suggesting the need for significant extra financial support to fund the building project. It was suggested that <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>would</b> be funded by Saudi Salafi groups. This was based on Tablighi Jamaat's being a Deobandi Muslim organisation that has close links with the form of the religion practised by the Saudi royal family.|$|E
5|$|In September 2017, Governor Larry Hogan {{announced}} {{a plan to}} widen the Baltimore-Washington Parkway by four lanes, adding express toll lanes to the median, {{as part of a}} $9 billion proposal to widen roads in Maryland. <b>The</b> <b>project</b> <b>would</b> be a public-private partnership with private companies responsible for constructing, operating, and maintaining the lanes.

5|$|In response, {{the study}} {{suggested}} that a third lane be constructed along the Sagtikos from the Southern State Parkway to the Long Island Expressway. The bridges over the Sagtikos at Campus Road and Crooked Hill Road (CR13) {{would have to be}} reconstructed {{to make room for the}} added lane, and the interchange with Pine Aire Drive (exitS3) would be completely rebuilt. A new interchange would also be constructed on the parkway between Pine Aire Drive and Campus Road, creating a junction with CR100. <b>The</b> <b>project</b> <b>would</b> cost $4billion (2011USD) and be built in phases for 15–20 years.|$|E
5|$|On December 19, 2012, NYSDOT {{announced}} {{a project to}} reconstruct NY149 and its junction with US4 in Fort Ann. <b>The</b> <b>project</b> <b>would</b> upgrade the intersection by doing an overall expansion, requiring the condemnation of one property. This new widening would help make turns from US4 south to NY149 west. The intersection would be repaved and drainage basins on US4 and NY149, which would tie into the system on Clay Hill Road. NYSDOT's website notes that announced that bids of the new project were announced in Fall2013 with construction beginning soon after. The slated date of completion for the $1.3million project would be in Fall2014.|$|E

5|$|On September 15, 2014, Marshall County {{officials}} {{brought the}} extension of I-68 up again {{as a way for}} oil companies to have easier access to drill into the area, likely by fracking. Much like the second leg of the Southern Beltway in the Pittsburgh area, an extension of I-68 is being spurred in response to the Marcellus natural gas trend. If the extension were to be built, it would also include a widening of WV2 to four lanes and would cost an estimated $5 million per mile. It is expected that <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>would</b> be divided into two legs, first from Morgantown to Cameron, then Cameron to Moundsville.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) {{objected to}} the {{construction}} of the Creek Turnpike in a letter dated January 30, 1990. FEMA felt that documentation on how <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>would</b> affect the floodplains in the area was lacking, preventing local authorities from requesting updates to floodplain maps, which were necessary to keep their communities enrolled in flood insurance programs.
