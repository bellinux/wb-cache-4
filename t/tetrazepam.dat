50|$|<b>Tetrazepam</b> is {{an unusual}} {{benzodiazepine}} in its molecular structure as it has cyclohexenyl group which has substituted the typical 5-phenyl moiety seen in other benzodiazepines.Tetrazepam, is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, within 45 mins and reaches peak plasma levels in less than 2 hours. It is classed as an intermediate acting benzodiazepine with an elimination half-life of approximately 15 hours. It is primarily metabolised to the inactive metabolites 3-hydroxy-tetrazepam and norhydroxytetrazepam. The pharmacological effects of <b>tetrazepam</b> are significantly less potent when compared against diazepam, in animal studies. <b>Tetrazepam</b> is a benzodiazepine site agonist and binds unselectively to type 1 and type 2 benzodiazepine site types {{as well as to}} peripheral benzodiazepine receptors. The muscle relaxant properties of <b>tetrazepam</b> are most likely due to a reduction of calcium influx. Small amounts of diazepam as well as the active metabolites of diazepam are produced from metabolism of <b>tetrazepam.</b> The metabolism of <b>tetrazepam</b> has led to false accusations of prisoners prescribed <b>tetrazepam</b> of taking illicit diazepam; this can lead to increased prison sentences for prisoners.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tetrazepam</b> (is marketed {{under the}} {{following}} brand names, Clinoxan, Epsipam, Myolastan, Musaril, Relaxam and Spasmorelax) is a benzodiazepine derivative with anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant and slightly hypnotic properties. It was formerly used mainly in Austria, France, Belgium, Germany and Spain to treat muscle spasm, anxiety {{disorders such as}} panic attacks, or more rarely to treat depression, premenstrual syndrome or agoraphobia. <b>Tetrazepam</b> has relatively little sedative effect at low doses while still producing useful muscle relaxation and anxiety relief. The Co-ordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures-Human (CMD(h)) endorsed the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) recommendation to suspend the marketing authorisations of tetrazepam-containing medicines across the European Union (EU) in April 2013.

40|$|Sedative {{agents are}} used to {{facilitate}} sexual assault due {{to their ability to}} render the victim passive, submissive and unable to resist. The primary pharmacological effect of the benzodiazepine <b>tetrazepam</b> is muscle relaxation, whereas the benzodiazepine diazepam acts on the central nervous system (CNS) exerting mainly sedation effects. Therefore, contrary to <b>tetrazepam,</b> diazepam is an often-abused drug, which can potentially be used as a date-rape drug. In this study, we describe the detection of low amounts of diazepam in Myolastan® (Sanofi-Synthelabo S. A. Brussels, Belgium) and Epsipam® (Will-Pharma, Wavre, Belgium) 50 mg tablet preparations by LC-MS-MS, GC-FID and HPLC-DAD. Considering the important forensic implication of this finding, a study was conducted with volunteers receiving a single or repeated dosage of Myolastan®. Urine, hair and preserved oral fluid samples were analysed using a previously described sensitive and specific LC-MS-MS detection method allowing for the simultaneous quantification of <b>tetrazepam,</b> diazepam, nordiazepam, oxazepam and temazepam. This study demonstrates that diazepam can be observed in urine samples even after a single dose of Myolastan®. In addition, maintaining therapy for 1 week results in the detection of both diazepam and nordiazepam in urine samples and of diazepam in the first hair segment. Importantly, comparing urine and hair samples after a single intake of diazepam versus the single and 1 week administration of Myolastan® shows that the possible metabolic conversion of <b>tetrazepam</b> to diazepam is a more plausible explanation for the detection of diazepam in biological samples after the intake of Myolastan®. As such, these results reveal that the presence of diazepam and/or nordiazepam in biological samples from alleged drug-facilitated assault cases should be interpreted with care. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

40|$|Diazepam and the {{structurally}} related 1, 4 -benzodiazepin- 2 -ones <b>tetrazepam,</b> prazepam and flunitrazepam are chiral molecules {{because they}} adopt a ground state conformation featuring a non-planar seven membered ring {{devoid of any}} reflection-symmetry element. The two conformational enantiomers of this class of benzodiazepines interconvert rapidly at room temperature by a simple ring flipping process. Low temperature HPLC on the Whelk-O 1 chiral stationary phase allowed us to separate the conformational enantiomers of diazepam and of the related 1, 4 -benzodiazepin- 2 -ones, under conditions where the interconversion rate is sufficiently low, compared to the chromatographic separation rate. Diazepam, <b>tetrazepam</b> and prazepam showed temperature dependent dynamic HPLC profiles with interconversion plateaus indicative of on-column enantiomer interconversion (enantiomerization) in the temperature range between − 10 °C and − 35 °C, whereas for flunitrazepam on-column interconversion was observed at temperatures between − 40 °C and − 66 °C. Simulation of exchange-deformed HPLC profiles using a computer program based on the stochastic model yielded the apparent rate constants for the on-column enantiomerization and the corresponding free energy activation barriers. At − 20 °C the enantiomerization barriers, ΔG≠, for diazepam, prazepam and <b>tetrazepam</b> were determined {{to be in the}} range 17. 6 – 18. 7 kcal/mol.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (or relatives) {{crushing}} drug tablets {{for patients}} with difficulties in swallowing {{are at risk of}} developing sensitization via airborne exposure. <b>Tetrazepam,</b> in particular, is increasingly being described as an important occupational allergen in this regard, although other drugs are also involved. OBJECTIVES: To identify the allergenic culprits in 4 patients, namely 2 nurses, 1 pharmacy assistant, and 1 spouse, who all regularly crushed tablets of systemic drugs and presented with severe airborne dermatitis. METHODS: The patients were patch tested with all of the drugs that they handled, as well as with potential cross-sensitizing molecules. RESULTS: All 4 patients reacted to <b>tetrazepam</b> and other benzodiazepines, some of which they had not previously come into contact with, which favours cross-reactivity rather than concomitant sensitization. These patients also had positive reactions to several other non-structurally related drugs for which, in some cases, there was no history of exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects having to crush drugs, in either an occupational or a non-occupational context, and who present with dermatitis suspected of being airborne-induced, should be patch tested with all contacted medicaments, as well as with possible cross-reacting molecules. Prevention by the use of crushing devices and protective measures (gloves and masks) when medications are handled should be advised. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Agas-chromatographic-mass spectrometricmethodwas {{developed}} for the simultaneous analysis of 18 benzodiazepines in human urine. Separation of this complex mixture of benzodiazepines was achieved on three capillary columns with phases: SPB-OCTYL, SPB- 1, HP- 5 MS. The thermal instability of benzodiazepines in the chromatographic process may lead to erroneous interpretation of obtained re-sults.

The practical usefulness of the developed conditionswas checked bymeans of uri-nalysis of two patients from the Neurosis Clinic and one patient undergoing metha-done treatment at the Department of Detoxification of Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology. Screening tests carried out on these patients to check abstinence compli-ance revealed compounds from the benzodiazepine group.

40|$|Introduction. Hypereosinophilic {{syndrome}} (HES) is a {{group of}} idiopathic disorders associated with single or multiple organ system dysfunction. HES must be distinguished from reactive eosinophilia in parasitic infections, allergic diseases, and especially from hematological diseases of clonal origin. Reactive eosinophilia due to infectious and parasitic diseases. Tissue helminth infections, especially toxocariasis, cause severe and long-standing hypereosinophilia. Despite specific therapy, eosinophilia may persist for over a year after diagnosis, and decreases slowly. Other helminth infections, such as trichinellosis, strongyloidosis, and rarely taeniasis and cysticercosis may also be diagnosed in patients with eosinophilia. Hematologic and other neoplastic diseases. Numerous neoplastic diseases, like Hodgkin's and other malignant lymphomas, myeloproliferative diseases, systemic mastocytosis etc., may be associated with marked eosinophilia. We had two patients with clinical and histological features resembling chronic eosinophilic leukemia, and many others with T-cell lymphoma, planocellular or adenocarcinoma etc. where eosinophilia persisted. Drug-induced eosinophilia. Drugs associated with eosinophilia include penicillins, tetracyclines, especially minocycline, clarithromycin, <b>tetrazepam,</b> mefloquine, and many others. Toxins associated with L-tryptophan cause eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and toxic oil syndrome, also belonging in this group. Treatment includes drug discontinuation and administration of corticosteroids. Hypereosinophilia with organ dysfunction. Many severe diseases, such as sarcoidosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, pemphigus vulgaris, eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases, inflammatory bowel disease and many others are associated with hypereosinophilia and target organ damage, e. g. involvement of the heart, lungs, skin, or nervous tissue. Conclusion. Eosinophilia can be classified as either familial or acquired. Hypereosinophilic syndrome is a subcategory of idiopathic eosinophilia. If the differential diagnosis of hypereosinophilia fails to resolve the etiology succesfully, the diagnosis of idiopathic HES remains...|$|E
40|$|Bioaccumulation is {{essential}} for gaining insight into the impact of exposure to organic micropollutants in aquatic fauna. Data are currently available on the bioaccumulation of persistent organic pollutants, but {{there is very little}} documentation on the bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). The bioconcentration of selected PPCPs was studied in marine mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis). The selected PPCPs were two organic UV filters, i. e., 2 -ethylhexyl- 4 -trimethoxycinnamate (EHMC) and octocrylene (OC), and two benzodiazepines (BZP), i. e., diazepam (DZP) and <b>tetrazepam</b> (TZP). Laboratory experiments were performed in which M. galloprovincialis was exposed to these compounds either directly from water, for the less lipophilic substances (BZP) or via spiked food for lipophilic UV filters. M. galloprovincialis uptook and eliminated BZP following first-order kinetics. The biological half-life (t (1 / 2)) of TZP was 1. 4 days, resulting in a bioconcentration factor of 64 and 99 mL g(- 1) dry weight (dw), respectively, for 2. 3 and 14. 5 mu g L- 1 of exposure, while the biological half-life (t (1 / 2)) of DZP was 0. 4 days, resulting in a bioconcentration factor of 51 mL g(- 1) dw for 13. 2 mu g L- 1 of exposure.

40|$|Skin testing with a {{suspected}} drug {{has been reported}} to be helpful in determining the cause of cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADR). Many isolated reports of positive drug skin tests are published, but without detailed information concerning the clinical features of the CADR and the method used in performing drug skin tests, such data are not very informative. A working party of the European Society of Contact Dermatitis (ESCD) for the study of skin testing in investigating cutaneous adverse drug reactions, has proposed the herein-reported guidelines for performing skin testing in CADR in order to standardize these procedures. In each reported case, the imputability of each drug taken {{at the onset of the}} CADR and a highly detailed description and characterization of the dermatitis need to be given. Drug skin tests are performed 6 weeks to 6 months after complete healing of the CADR. Drug patch tests are performed according to the methods used in patch testing in studying contact dermatitis. The commercialized form of the drug used by the patient is tested diluted at 30 % pet. (pet.) and/or water (aq.). The pure drug is tested diluted at 10 % in pet. or aq. In severe CADR, drug patch tests are performed at lower concentrations. It is also of value to test on the most affected site of the initial CADR. Drug prick tests are performed on the volar forearm skin with the commercialized form of the drug, but with sequential dilutions in cases of urticaria. Intradermal tests (IDT) are performed with sterile sequential dilutions (10 - 4, 10 - 3, 10 - 2, 10 - 1) of a pure sterile or an injectable form of the suspected drug with a small volume of 0. 04 ml. Drug skin tests need to be read at 20 min and also later at D 2 and D 4 for patch tests, at D 1 for prick tests and IDT. All these tests also need to be read at 1 week. The success of skin tests varies with the drug tested, with a high % of positive results, for example, with betalactam antibiotics, pristinamycin, carbamazepine and <b>tetrazepam</b> on patch testing, or with betalactam antibiotics and heparins on delayed readings of IDT. The results of drug skin tests also depend on the clinical features of the CADR. The use of appropriate control patients is necessary to avoid false-positive results...|$|E
40|$|Editorial Group: Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group. Published Online: 18 JAN 2012. Assessed as up-to-date: 6 SEP 2011 BACKGROUND Pain {{management}} {{is a high}} priority for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Muscle relaxants include drugs that reduce muscle spasm (for example benzodiazepines such as diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax), lorazepam (Ativan) and non-benzodiazepines such as metaxalone (Skelaxin) or a combination of paracetamol and orphenadrine (Muscol)) and drugs that prevent increased muscle tone (baclofen and dantrolene). Despite a paucity of evidence supporting their use, antispasmodic and antispasticity muscle relaxants have gained widespread clinical acceptance as adjuvants in the management of patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. OBJECTIVES The aim of this review was to determine the efficacy and safety of muscle relaxants in pain management in patients with RA. The muscle relaxants that were included in this review are the antispasmodic benzodiazepines (alprazolam, bromazepam, chlordiazepoxide,cinolazepam, clonazepam, cloxazolam, clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam, flunitrazepam, flurazepam, flutoprazepam, halazepam, ketazolam, loprazolam, lorazepam, lormetazepam, medazepam, midazolam, nimetazepam, nitrazepam, nordazepam, oxazepam, pinazepam, prazepam, quazepam, temazepam, <b>tetrazepam,</b> triazolam), antispasmodic non-benzodiazepines (cyclobenzaprine, carisoprodol, chlorzoxazone, meprobamate, methocarbamol, metaxalone, orphenadrine, tizanidine and zopiclone), and antispasticity drugs (baclofen and dantrolene sodium). SEARCH METHODS We performed a search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 4 th quarter 2010), MEDLINE (1950 to week 1 November 2010), EMBASE (Week 44 2010), and PsycINFO (1806 to week 2 November 2010). We also searched the 2008 to 2009 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) abstracts and performed a handsearch of reference lists of relevant articles. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials which compared a muscle relaxant to another therapy (active, including non-pharmacological therapies, or placebo) in adult patients with RA and that reported at least one clinically relevant outcome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two blinded review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the trials. Meta-analyses were used to examine the efficacy of muscle relaxants on pain, depression, sleep and function, as well as their safety. MAIN RESULTS Six trials (126 participants) were included in this review. All trials were rated at high risk of bias. Five cross-over trials evaluated a benzodiazepine, four assessed diazepam (n = 71) and one assessed triazolam (n = 15). The sixth trial assessed zopiclone (a non-benzodiazepine) (n = 40) and was a parallel group study. No trial duration was longer than two weeks while three single dose trials assessed outcomes at 24 hours only. Overall the included trials failed to find evidence of a beneficial effect of muscle relaxants over placebo, alone (at 24 hrs, 1 or 2 weeks) or in addition to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (at 24 hrs), on pain intensity, function, or quality of life. Data from two trials of longer than 24 hours duration (n = 74) (diazepam and zopiclone) found that participants who received a muscle relaxant had significantly more adverse events compared with those who received placebo (number needed to harm (NNTH) 3, 95 % CI 2 to 7). These were predominantly central nervous system side effects, including dizziness and drowsiness (NNTH 3, 95 % CI 2 to 11). AUTHORS’ CONCLUSIONS Based upon the currently available evidence in patients with RA, benzodiazepines (diazepam and triazolam) {{do not appear to be}} beneficial in improving pain over 24 hours or one week. The non-benzodiazepine agent zopiclone also did not significantly reduce pain over two weeks. However, even short term muscle relaxant use (24 hours to 2 weeks) is associated with significant adverse events, predominantly drowsiness and dizziness.
