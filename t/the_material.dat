Five research questions are formulated to reach the objective. This study is a research and development (R & D) type. The instruments used in the study were questionnaires and observation. The data from the questionnaires were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively, whereas the data from the observation was analyzed qualitatively. <b>The</b> development of <b>materials</b> consisted of eleven steps namely conducting the needs analysis, selecting the topics, developing the course grid, developing <b>the</b> <b>materials,</b> conducting <b>the</b> first try-out, evaluating <b>the</b> <b>materials,</b> revising <b>the</b> <b>materials,</b> conducting <b>the</b> second try-out, evaluating <b>the</b> <b>materials,</b> revising <b>the</b> <b>materials,</b> and writing <b>the</b> final draft of <b>the</b> <b>materials.</b> <b>The</b> findings reveal five important results. The first finding is related to the needs analysis. The results show that <b>the</b> <b>materials</b> are highly visual, auditory, and audiovisual. Besides, <b>the</b> developed <b>materials</b> have varied tasks, a vocabulary list, and games. The results of the questionnaires also show that a large number of students prefer studying in pairs or groups to studying alone. The second finding is related to the course grid of <b>the</b> <b>materials.</b> There are five parts in every unit namely warm up, input, focus on comprehension, focus on language, and focus on communication. The third finding is related to <b>the</b> designed <b>materials.</b> <b>The</b> developed English <b>materials</b> in this study consist of four units. The fourth finding is related to the try-out. The average points or means of the second questionnaires in the try out, which range from 3. 4 up to 3. 6, show that the students agree to <b>the</b> developed <b>materials.</b> <b>The</b> last finding is related to the evaluation and revision of <b>the</b> <b>materials.</b> <b>The</b> effective <b>materials</b> are achieved through some revisions on the instructions and tasks...|$|R
