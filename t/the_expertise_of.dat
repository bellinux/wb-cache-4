5|$|Beginning in 1964, {{however, the}} Kingston Trio's {{dominance}} in record sales and concert bookings began to wane, due partly to imitators in the pop-folk world {{and also to}} the rise of other commercial folk groups like Peter, Paul and Mary. The British Invasion spearheaded by The Beatles, who were signed by EMI/Capitol just as the Trio's seven-year contract was running out, depressed sales of acoustic folk albums significantly, and Capitol did not make a serious effort to re-sign the group. Werber secured a generous signing bonus from Decca Records, and the last four albums of the Kingston Trio's first decade were released by that label. Without the production facilities of Capitol, however, and <b>the</b> <b>expertise</b> <b>of</b> Voyle Gilmore and engineer Pete Abbott, the Decca releases lacked the aural brilliance of the Capitol albums, and none of the four sold especially well.|$|E
5|$|The DDL {{project was}} {{reviewed}} {{again when the}} Liberal Fraser Government came into office in late 1975. The review panel unanimously advised the new Minister for Defence James Killen that the DDL project was no longer viable as {{the total cost of}} the ships would be about $130 million higher than the Oliver Hazard Perry project, and it would take three years longer for the DDLs to be completed. Killen accepted this advice, and a firm order for two Oliver Hazard Perry frigates was placed in February 1976. A third ship was ordered in late 1977. Six of these frigates, which were designated the , were eventually ordered, and the final two were built in Australia at Williamstown. <b>The</b> <b>expertise</b> <b>of</b> the DDL project office and the preparations which had been undertaken to manage the process of ordering and building the ships contributed to the Navy's ability to rapidly evaluate alternative designs and oversee their entry into service once an order was placed.|$|E
5|$|Currently, the {{conservation}} department serves {{the needs of}} the museum through <b>the</b> <b>expertise</b> <b>of</b> specialists in paintings, textiles, works on paper, frames, and objects conservation. The department has grown in both size and staff throughout the years, with the most recent expansion occurring in 2007. As of 2007, the IMA owned one of the few computer-based X-ray units in the United States, continuing a trend in X-ray technology that the department began in the 1970s. In 1980, the department helped organize and establish the Midwest Regional Conservation Guild, which includes conservators and conservation scientists from Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan. In the mid-1980s, the department received attention when head conservator Martin Radecki assisted local authorities in uncovering over two dozen forged T.C. Steele and William Forsythe paintings worth more than $200,000. The high-profile forgery case led Radecki to organize an exhibit in 1989, Is it Genuine? Steele, Forsythe and Forgery in Indiana. The exhibit highlighted conservation techniques and examined how forgeries can be discovered. Another public presentation of conservation took place in 2007 with Sebastiano Mainardi: The Science of Art, a Star Studio exhibit that allowed visitors to watch conservators as they worked on the 16th-century altarpiece. The IMA's Star Studio is an interactive gallery that enables visitors to learn, through the process of art-making and observation, about the museum's collections.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—One {{of the key}} {{challenges}} for users of social media is judging <b>the</b> topical <b>expertise</b> <b>of</b> other users in order to select trustful information sources about specific topics and to judge credibility of content produced by others. In this paper, we explore the usefulness {{of different types of}} user-related data for making sense about <b>the</b> topical <b>expertise</b> <b>of</b> Twitter users. Types of user-related data include messages a user authored or re-published, biographical information a user published on his/her profile page and information about user lists to which a user belongs. We conducted a user study that explores how useful different types of data are for informing human’s expertise judgements. We then used topic modeling based on different types of data to build and assess computational <b>expertise</b> models <b>of</b> Twitter users. We use Wefollow directories as a proxy measurement for perceived expertise in this assessment. Our findings show that different types of user-related data indeed differ substantially in their ability to inform computational expertise models and humans’s expertise judgements. Tweets and retweets — which are often used in literature for gauging <b>the</b> <b>expertise</b> area <b>of</b> users — are surprisingly useless for inferring <b>the</b> <b>expertise</b> topics <b>of</b> their authors and are outperformed by other types of user-related data such as information about users’ list memberships. Our results have implications for algorithms, user interfaces and methods that focus on capturing <b>expertise</b> <b>of</b> social media users.
