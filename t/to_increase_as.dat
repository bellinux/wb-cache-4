5|$|After {{entering}} the southern Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Ivan weakened to Category4 status by 0600UTC on September 14. As it gradually {{turned to the}} north, southwesterly flow from a large trough over the central United States increased wind shear over the hurricane. An eyewall replacement cycle, along with dry air and restricted outflow, contributed to the weakening. By late on September 14 the weakening trend ceased as the eyewall became better defined, and Ivan was expected to restrengthen slightly over an area of warmer water temperatures. The eye diameter expanded to 60miles (95km/h), though concurrently westerly wind shear and dry air continued <b>to</b> <b>increase.</b> <b>As</b> Ivan approached the Gulf Coast of the United States, Hurricane Hunters reported erosion of the southern portion of the eyewall, and cooler waters just offshore contributed to further weakening. At around 0650UTC on September 16, Hurricane Ivan made landfall just west of Gulf Shores, Alabama with an intensity of 120mph (195km/h); the strongest winds occurred over a narrow area near the southern Alabama and western Florida border. Its landfall {{was accompanied by a}} 10–15feet (3–4.5m) storm surge from Destin, Florida westward to Mobile Bay.|$|E
5|$|Due to low {{amounts of}} {{vertical}} shear, very warm waters, and abundant moisture, steady intensification was forecast, and the depression strengthened to Tropical Storm John later on August 28. Deep convection continued to develop over the storm, while an eye feature developed within the expanding central dense overcast. The storm continued to intensify, and John attained hurricane status on August 29 while 190miles (305km) south-southeast of Acapulco. Banding features continued <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>as</b> the hurricane moved west-northwestward around the southwest periphery of a mid- to upper-level ridge over northern Mexico. The hurricane underwent rapid intensification, and John attained major hurricane status 12hours after becoming a hurricane. Shortly thereafter, the eye became obscured, {{and the intensity}} remained at 115mph (185km/h) due to an eyewall replacement cycle. Another eye formed, and based on Reconnaissance data, the hurricane attained Category4 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale on August 30 about 160miles (260km) west of Acapulco, or 95miles (155km) south of Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán. Hours later, the hurricane underwent another eyewall replacement cycle, and subsequently weakened to Category3 status as it paralleled the Mexican coastline a short distance offshore.|$|E

5|$|The boom in {{skyscraper}} construction {{began to}} falter following the Wall Street Crash of 1929, with fast economic growth {{giving way to}} the slump years of the Great Depression: construction of all sorts slowed considerably. The real estate market that lay behind new skyscraper builds collapsed, {{and the value of}} many properties dropped dramatically: the American Insurance Union tower cost $8 million ($1.2 billion in 2010 terms) to build in 1927, but was valued at only $3.5 million ($900 million) by 1933; the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building defaulted on its debts in 1935 and was put on sale for just $1.2 million ($240 m). The major bond house of S.W. Straus, behind many successful developments, defaulted on the $214 million ($47 billion) in bonds held by 60,000 investors; the Van Swerigan developer brothers went bankrupt. Vacancy rates began <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>as</b> the recession bit, increasing from only one percent in central New York in early 1920 to 17 percent in 1931 and 25 percent by 1934.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of factory ships with stern slipways in 1925 substantially {{increased the number}} of whales taken per year. In 1937–38 alone, over 29,000 fin whales were taken. From 1953–54 to 1961–62, the catch averaged over 30,000 per year. By 1962–63, sei whale catches began <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>as</b> fin whales became scarce. By 1975–76, fewer than 1,000 fin whales were being caught each year. In the North Pacific, over 74,000 fin whales were caught between 1910 and 1975. Between 1910 and 1989, over 55,000 were caught in the North Atlantic. Coastal groups in northeast Asian waters, along with many other baleen species, were likely driven into serious perils or functional extinctions by industrial catches by Japan covering wide ranges of China and Korean EEZ within very short period in 20th century. Migrations of the species into Japanese EEZ and in East China Sea were likely to be exterminated relatively earlier, as the last catch records on Amami Oshima was between the 1910s and 1930s. After the cease of exploiting Asian stocks, Japan kept mass commercial and illegal hunts until 1975. Several thousand individuals were hunted from various stations mainly along coasts of Hokkaido, Sanriku, and the Gotō Islands.|$|E
5|$|The {{strengthening}} was {{the result}} of Conson passing over the warm waters of the Kuroshio Current. The forward motion on the typhoon also began <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>as</b> it interacted with a baroclinic zone. Shortly after, the JMA assessed the storm to have reached its peak intensity with winds of 150km/h (90mph 10-minute winds) and a minimum pressure of 960hPa (mbar). Later that day, the storm passed over Okinawa as it weakened. By June10, Conson began to undergo an extratropical transition. Continuing increase in forward speed caused the low to become exposed from shower and thunderstorm activity on the southern edge of the circulation. Around 1200UTC, the center of circulation became separated from deep convection, leading to the typhoon being downgraded to a tropical storm by both agencies several hours later. Early on June11, the JTWC reported that the storm had completed its extratropical transition just south of Japan. However, the JMA kept Conson has a tropical cyclone through its landfall in Kōchi Prefecture as a minimal tropical storm. Shortly after landfall, it was classified as an extratropical cyclone. Continuing towards the northeast, the storm remained weak and was last mentioned as it crossed the international date line on June14 near the Aleutian Islands.|$|E

5|$|The {{provisional}} government lacked direction in policy and planning, resulting in its quick collapse. The number of rural attacks instigated by the Viet Cong surged {{in the wake}} of Diệm's deposal, due to the displacement of troops into urban areas for the coup. The increasingly free discussion generated from the surfacing of new and accurate data following the coup revealed that the military situation was far worse than what was reported by Diệm. The incidence of Việt Cộng attacks continued <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>as</b> it had done during the summer of 1963, the weapons loss ratio worsened and the rate of Viet Cong defections fell. The units that participated in the coup were returned to the field to guard against a possible major communist offensive in the countryside. The falsification of military statistics by Diệm's officials had led to miscalculations, which manifested themselves in military setbacks after Diệm's death. Aside from battlefield setbacks, something that was outside his remit, Thơ was also becoming unpopular in the military establishment. One of the goals of the various anti-Minh coup plots at the time was to remove Thơ, and the prime minister's unpopularity helped to distract some of the incumbent officers from {{the fact that they were}} the primary target; at that time, the MRC was moving toward removing Thơ, and Minh was the only senior general to retain confidence in him.|$|E
