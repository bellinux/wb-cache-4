5|$|In 1943, the {{congregation}} {{changed its name}} to Temple Israel. Its membership grew rapidly, from 914 families in 1944 to over 1,100 by late 1949, together with {{an increase in the number}} of children in line with the post-war post–World War II baby boom. In 1951 the temple added a new education building, which had 22 classrooms, offices, and a library. That year {{the congregation}} also updated the synagogue's kitchen, added air conditioning for the vestry and auditorium, and <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sanctuary in 1953. Ettelson retired the following year, and was succeeded as senior rabbi by James Wax.|$|E
5|$|Kansas, meanwhile, was less-highly {{regarded}} {{on defense}} and came into the 2008 Orange Bowl ranked 57thnationally in pass defense. On the ground, however, Kansas was ranked far higher—sixth in the nation. In addition, Kansas only allowed an average of 16points per game, good enough for to be ranked fourth nationally. A key portion of that run defense was defensive tackle James McClinton, who was named the Big12's Defensive Lineman of the Year and earned second-team All-America honors. McClinton finished the 2007 regular season with 10.5tackles for loss and promised more of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Orange Bowl. The team captain of the Jayhawk defense, meanwhile, was All-American cornerback Aqib Talib. Talib was also a threat on offense, catching eightpasses, including fourtouchdowns, during the regular season.|$|E

Originally a point was given to each rider for his placing on each stage, but the organizers chose to give the riders who placed 51st or higher in a stage 51 points and keep the point distribution system <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> riders who placed 1st through 50th in a stage.|$|E
5|$|The Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horse is a horse breed {{from the}} U.S. state of Kentucky. Developed as an {{all-around}} farm and riding horse in eastern Kentucky, it {{is related to}} the Tennessee Walking Horse and other gaited breeds. In 1989 the Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horse Association (KMSHA) was formed, and in 2002, the subsidiary Spotted Mountain Horse Association (SMHA) was developed to register Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horses with excessive white markings and pinto patterns. Conformation standards are <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> two groups of horses, with the main difference being the color requirements. The KMSHA studbook is now closed to horses from unregistered parents, although it cross-registers with several other registries, while the SMHA studbook remains open.|$|E

5|$|Before {{leaving the}} next morning, the Doctor stops to ask Emma {{if she could}} sense {{anything}} unusual about Clara, but Emma reveals that Clara seems normal to her. The Doctor offers Hila a lift to any other place in history and concludes {{that she is a}} direct descendant of Emma and Palmer. He reasons that their relation resulted in a blood connection that helped them open the gateway to rescue her. While contemplating the bonds that love can create, the Doctor suddenly realises that there is another creature within Caliburn House. Just as Emma and Palmer were not part of a ghost story but a love story, the Doctor considers <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> creatures — that the one trapped in the pocket universe has been trying to reunite with its mate. The Doctor asks Emma for a favour and they use Emma and the TARDIS to retrieve the other creature from the pocket universe.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher {{began to}} pull away from Häkkinen. de la Rosa ran into the rear of Alesi at Wurth corner on lap two causing Alesi to retire, with de la Rosa {{sustaining}} a broken front wing and retired after going off at Campsa corner. Further back, Irvine passed Verstappen for twelfth position. The positions at the front were <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next sixteen laps with the gap between Michael Schumacher and Häkkinen fluctated from 1.6 seconds to 3.4 seconds while Coulthard and Barrichello battled Ralf Schumacher for third position. Button became the first driver to make a pit stop on lap 18 and rejoined in front of Mazzacane. Villeneuve made his pit stop on the 21st lap, which promoted Frentzen into the points-scoring positions. After rejoining the circuit, his car caught fire and he pulled {{off to the side of}} the track at the exit of Seat corner. Trulli's pit stop, which dropped him to 17th, proved problematic: he stalled his engine which required his mechanics to restart it. Ralf Schumacher made a pit stop one lap later and re-emerged in fifth. On lap 24, Michael Schumacher made his pit stop. As he accelerated from his pit box, his rear wheel hit the Ferrari refuller Nigel Stepney who was dragged before being knocked over. Stepney was taken to the circuit's medical center for observation and he was replaced by reserve refuller Andrea Vacari. Coulthard made a pit stop on the same lap and experienced problems with leaving his pit box because he selected second gear and re-emerged behind Ralf Schumacher.|$|E
