5|$|It {{was also}} {{predicted}} that the standing water caused by the storm surge would render {{most of the city}} uninhabitable for weeks and that the destruction of oil and petrochemical refineries in the surrounding area would spill waste into the flooding. The resulting mess would coat every surface, converting the city into a toxic marsh until water could be drained. Some experts said that it could take six months or longer to pump all <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>out</b> of the city.|$|E

On 27 November the convoy came under attack from the Italian Navy in the Battle of Cape Spartivento. MacLachlan saw the Italian fleet at a distance and witnessed enemy shells splashing around the ship. He also witnessed an attack by Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bombers but they failed to damage the ships. Most of the Hurricanes that took off from the Argus fell into <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>out</b> of fuel. The pilots had not run the Hurricanes at economic speeds for fuel consumption.|$|E
5|$|Muskrats {{spend much}} of their time in the water and are well suited for their semiaquatic life. They can swim under water for 12 to 17 minutes. Their bodies, like those of seals and whales, are less {{sensitive}} to the buildup of carbon dioxide than those of most other mammals. They can close off their ears to keep <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>out.</b> Their hind feet are semi-webbed, although in swimming, their tails are their main means of propulsion.|$|E

5|$|Respiration {{involves}} drawing {{water into}} the mantle cavity through an aperture, passing it through the gills, and expelling it through the siphon. The ingress of water is achieved by contraction of radial muscles in the mantle wall, and flapper valves shut when strong circular muscles force <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>out</b> through the siphon. Extensive connective tissue lattices support the respiratory muscles {{and allow them to}} expand the respiratory chamber. The lamella structure of the gills allows for a high oxygen uptake; up to 65% in water at 20⁰C. Water flow over the gills correlates with locomotion, and an octopus can propel its body when it expels water out of its siphon.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{stricken}} from the Navy List on 30 November and salvage work began on 5 December. The {{holes in the}} ship's hull had to be sealed to pump <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>out</b> and decrease her draft. The remains of her flight deck and upper hangar could not be made watertight and were removed using dynamite. Pontoons were used to right the ship and she was refloated on 31 July 1946. The salvage job was conducted by the Hitachi Zosen facility in Kure and they scrapped the ship afterward. The job was completed by 12 December 1947.|$|E
5|$|Captained by Commander Geoffrey Layton, her post-completion trials {{lasted for}} five months as {{she was used to}} {{evaluate}} steam power for submarine use. Much was learned about the operation of steam submarines, which helped the subsequent design of the steam-powered K-class fleet submarines. She proved to be very unstable while surfacing, presumably because she could not pump <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>out</b> of her controlled free-flooding spaces quickly enough in the upper part of her double hull. These problems, coupled with {{the fact that she was}} too slow to work with the fleet as originally envisioned, meant that she was impossible to make into an effective warship, and she was laid up after her trials.|$|E

5|$|On 19 December, {{the first}} winter storm struck the French squadron. In the heavy waves and high winds, first Windham and then Vénus were {{separated}} from the convoy, Manche marshalling the remaining ships and continuing the southwards journey. Windhams French prize crew were able {{to regain control of}} their ship and continued on to Île de France alone, but Vénus was struck by an even larger hurricane on 27 December and lost all three topmasts in the gale. The French crew panicked as the storm began, and refused to attend to the sails or even close the hatches: as a result the vessel almost founded as huge amounts of water poured into the ship. In desperation, Hamelin called Captain Stewart to his cabin and requested that his men save the ship but demanded that Stewart give his word that his men would not attempt to escape or seize the frigate. Stewart refused to give any such guarantee but agreed to help repair the damage and bring the ship to safety. After securing the weapons lockers aboard, Hamelin agreed and Stewart and his men cut away the wrecked masts and pumped <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>out</b> of the hold, repairing the ship so {{that she was able to}} continue her journey without fear of foundering.|$|E

25|$|Stevin's {{work in the}} waterstaet {{involved}} {{improvements to}} the sluices and spillways to control flooding. Windmills were already in use to pump <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>out</b> but in Van de Molens (On mills), he suggested improvements including ideas that the wheels should move slowly with a better system for meshing of the gear teeth. These improved {{the efficiency of the}} windmills used in pumping water out of the polders by three times. He received a patent on his innovation in 1586.|$|E
25|$|The {{water system}} however {{was far more}} complex than just the {{reservoirs}} and the water conduits and involved a very sophisticated ancient system of closed pipes and irrigation. The irrigation was divided into five zones, two serving north part of the structure and three the southern part. Amazingly the irrigation system {{was designed to be}} harmonious with the structure so that at places there were central drainage canals {{in the center of the}} columns and small draining holes and conduits on each floor that would take <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>out</b> of roof, each floor, and the sewage portals into an underground sewage network and away from the structure.|$|E
25|$|One incident, {{which took}} place in June 1873 on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, {{involved}} the boat the Henry C. Flagg and its drunk captain. That boat was already leaking; the crew, having partially pumped <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>out,</b> entered Lock 74, moving in front of another boat. Because they failed to snub the boat, it crashed into and knocked out the downstream gates. The outrush of water from the lock caused the upstream gates to slam shut, breaking them also, and sending a cascade of water over the boat, sinking it. This suspended navigation on the canal for 48 hours until the lock gates could be replaced and the boat removed from the lock.|$|E

25|$|Consolidation is {{a process}} by which soils {{decrease}} in volume. It occurs when stress is applied to a soil that causes the soil particles to pack together more tightly, therefore reducing volume. When this occurs in a soil that is saturated with water, water will be squeezed out of the soil. The time required to squeeze <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>out</b> of a thick deposit of clayey soil layer might be years. For a layer of sand, the water may be squeezed out {{in a matter of}} seconds. A building foundation or construction of a new embankment will cause the soil below to consolidate and this will cause settlement which in turn may cause distress to the building or embankment. Karl Terzaghi developed the theory of consolidation which enables prediction of the amount of settlement and the time required for the settlement to occur. Soils are tested with an oedometer test to determine their compression index and coefficient of consolidation.|$|E
25|$|In 1860, Thomas Fletcher paid {{contractors}} {{to build a}} reservoir on his land, intending that it should supply the Ainsworth Mill with water. Fletcher played no {{active role in the}} construction, instead contracting out to a competent engineer. While building it, the contractors discovered a series of old coal shafts and passages under the land filled loosely with soil and debris, which joined up with John Rylands's adjoining mine. Rather than blocking these shafts up, the contractors left them. On 11 December 1860, shortly after being filled for the first time, Fletcher's reservoir burst and flooded Rylands's mine, the Red House Colliery, causing £937 worth of damage. Fletcher pumped <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>out,</b> but on 17 April 1861 his pump burst, and the mine again began to flood. At this point a mines inspector was brought in, and the sunken coal shafts were discovered. Rylands and the owner, Jehu Horrocks, brought a claim against Fletcher on 4 November 1861.|$|E
25|$|The ferries were {{in major}} decline by the 1950s. In 1948, the No. 3 {{was taken off}} of regular service and was sold in 1953. The cost of {{operating}} the ferries was high, and the last sailing by the No. 4 ferry took place on August 30, 1958. The No. 4 was later sold {{to be used in}} Prince Rupert. Later, No. 4 returned to Vancouver and was tied up on the Vancouver side of Burrard Inlet. She was in desperate need of a refit and had to be kept afloat with pumps to keep <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>out</b> of her hull. When the power failed and the pumps stopped she went to the bottom. The No. 5 was converted into the Seven Seas Restaurant at the foot of Lonsdale in North Vancouver. It remained there until 2002 when the City of North Vancouver and the federal courts had it demolished after a long-standing dispute over who would be responsible if it sank and concern that the hull was in danger of imminent collapse. In dry dock it proved to be quite sound, but at that point the decision had already been made to scrap it.|$|E
