25|$|The third {{match was}} between Crowbar and Terry Funk for the WCW Hardcore Championship. The match started when Funk ambushed Crowbar backstage. They fought inside a truck, and Funk sent Crowbar through {{a table with}} a hip toss. Crowbar {{attacked}} Funk with a car door, and slammed a door into Funk's head. Funk performed a low blow, and slammed the door into Crowbar's head repeatedly. Funk handcuffed Crowbar, and attacked him with <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>door</b> and a steel chair. Crowbar fought back with the chair, and performed a slingshot splash to Funk through a table.

500|$|The Incredibles {{not only}} {{dealt with the}} trouble of animating CG humans, but also many other complications. The story was bigger than any prior story at the studio, was longer in running time, and had four {{times the number of}} locations. Supervising {{technical}} director Rick Sayre noted that the hardest thing about the film was that there was [...] "no hardest thing," [...] alluding to the amount of new technical challenges: fire, water, air, smoke, steam, and explosions were all additional to the new difficulty of working with humans. The film's organizational structure could not be mapped out like previous Pixar features, and it became a running joke to the team. Sayre said the team adopted “Alpha Omega," [...] where one team was concerned with building modeling, shading and layout and another dealt with final camera, lighting, and effects. Another team, dubbed as the character team, digitally sculpted, rigged, and shaded the characters, and a simulation team was responsible for developing simulation technology for hair and clothing. There were 781 visual effects shots in the film, and they were quite often visual gags, such as the window shattering when Bob angrily shuts <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>door.</b> In addition, the effects team improved their modeling of clouds, using volumetric rendering for the first time.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of November 8, Bundy approached 18-year-old telephone operator Carol DaRonch at Fashion Place Mall in Murray, Utah, {{less than a mile}} from the Midvale restaurant where Melissa Smith was last seen. He identified himself as [...] "Officer Roseland" [...] of the Murray Police Department, told DaRonch that someone had attempted to break into her car, and asked her to accompany him to the station to file a complaint. When DaRonch pointed out that Bundy was driving on a road that did not lead to the police station, he immediately pulled to the shoulder and attempted to handcuff her. During their struggle, he inadvertently fastened both handcuffs to the same wrist, and DaRonch was able to open <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>door</b> and escape. Later that evening, Debra Jean Kent, a 17-year-old student at Viewmont High School in Bountiful, [...] north of Murray, disappeared after leaving a theater production at the school to pick up her brother. The school's drama teacher and a student told police that [...] "a stranger" [...] had asked each of them to come out to the parking lot to identify a car. Another student later saw the same man pacing in the rear of the auditorium, and the drama teacher spotted him again shortly before the end of the play. Outside the auditorium, investigators found a key that unlocked the handcuffs removed from Carol DaRonch's wrist.|$|E

2500|$|Tatchell {{researched}} the Gukurahundi attacks in Matabeleland in the 1980s, when the Zimbabwean Fifth Brigade attacked {{supporters of the}} Zimbabwe African Peoples Union. He became convinced that Mugabe had broken international human rights law during the attack, which is estimated to have involved the massacre of around 20,000 civilians. Then in 1999, journalists Mark Chavunduka and Ray Choto were tortured by the Zimbabwe Army. The arrest of Augusto Pinochet in London seemed to him a precedent that human rights violations could be pursued against a head of state, thanks {{to the principle of}} universal jurisdiction. On 30 October 1999 Tatchell and three other OutRage! activists approached Mugabe's car in a London street and attempted to perform a citizen's arrest. Tatchell opened <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>door</b> and grabbed Mugabe. He then called the police. The four OutRage! activists were arrested, on charges including criminal damage, assault and breach of the peace; charges were dropped on the opening day of their trial.

Menkes had also {{been a member of the}} post-independence terrorist group Kingdom of Israel. The assassination squad consisted of Menkes (the leader), Ze'ev Eckstein (the shooter), and Dan Shemer (the driver). The three men had waited in a jeep parked outside Kastner's house. Eckstein disembarked and approached Kastner as he locked his car, and asked him if he was Rudolf Kastner. When Kastner confirmed, Eckstein pulled out a handgun and fired three times. The first shot was a spent bullet, the second hit <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>door,</b> and the third hit Kastner in the upper body, critically wounding him.

Nowak was subsequently arrested at Orlando International Airport on charges of attempted kidnapping, battery, attempted vehicle burglary with battery, and destruction of evidence. In a handwritten request for a restraining order against Nowak after her arrest, Shipman referred to Nowak as an acquaintance of a boyfriend but did not identify Oefelein, and also claimed Nowak had been stalking her for two months. Nowak told investigators she was involved in a relationship with Oefelein which she described as being [...] "more than a working relationship but less than a romantic relationship".

Tremendous changes {{took place in}} the design of automobiles such as aerodynamics, green fuels, electronic control unit. In the past decades the new design for <b>the</b> modern <b>car</b> <b>doors</b> were introduced. <b>The</b> modern <b>car</b> <b>doors</b> are less convenient during parking because of the space for the parking vehicle is less and congested. This design also creates a problem during heavy traffic situations. A new <b>car</b> <b>door</b> concept is designed mainly focused to avoid these problems. This also helps to avoid accidents during opening and closing of <b>car</b> <b>doors.</b> This mechanism includes a roller bearing and aluminium rail with a lock mechanism...|$|R

2500|$|In October 2003, Travis {{escaped from}} the Herolds' car and held up traffic at a busy intersection, {{and was on the}} loose for several hours. [...] The {{incident}} began after a pedestrian threw something at the car that went through a partially open window and struck Travis while they were stopped at a traffic light. [...] Startled, Travis unbuckled his seat belt, opened <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>door</b> and chased the man, but did not catch him. [...] When police arrived, they lured the chimpanzee into the car several times only to have Travis let himself out of another door and occasionally chase the officers around the car. [...] The 2003 incident led to the passing of a Connecticut law prohibiting people from keeping primates weighing more than 50 pounds as pets and requiring owners of exotic pets to apply for a permit. The new law took effect in 2004, and as of Travis's death, no one in the state had applied to adopt a chimpanzee. The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection did not enforce the law on the Herolds because they had owned 200-pound Travis for so long and because the DEP did not believe Travis posed a public safety risk.|$|E
