5|$|Propagation is by seed, {{but these}} are hard to obtain. Seeds do not require any {{treatment}} before sowing, and take 37 to 40 days to germinate. Propagation by cutting has not been attempted, but might be possible, since the closely related B.cuneata has been propagated this way, albeit with unpredictable results. The plant should be grown in deep, acidic to neutral sand at a sheltered site. It is recommended <b>to</b> <b>prune</b> it when young, to encourage branching.|$|E
5|$|Before {{releasing}} the film, Madonna invited {{a group of}} friends and co-workers to watch a rough three-hour cut of the film at a local theater in Notting Hill, and noted their feedback. General consensus was that there was too much of Kabbalah in the film, hence she decided <b>to</b> <b>prune</b> those segments considerably. The documentary premiered on MTV in the United States, on October 21, 2005, at 10:00 PM. She also showed it to the film students at New York's Hunter College and appeared for a Q session. This promotion was a part of mtvU's Stand In series, in which celebrities filled in for college professors.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{local governments have}} {{implemented}} tree and landscape ordinances, which will help communities by providing shade during summer. Tree protection is an ordinance that does not allow someone <b>to</b> <b>prune</b> or remove trees without a city permit. An example is the city of Glendale, California: Through the Indigenous Tree Ordinance, the city of Glendale protects the following species of trees, the California sycamore, the coast live oak, mesa oak, valley oak, scrub oak, California bay. Anyone who is planning on removing or trimming the trees has to obtain an indigenous tree permit. Within the permit they have to provide detailed information {{about the number of}} trees affected, trunk diameter and the health of the tree itself. They also have to submit photographs of the site, and a site plan sketch.|$|E

500|$|Hemingway biographer Carlos Baker {{writes that}} Hemingway {{learned from his}} short stories how to [...] "get the most from the least, how <b>to</b> <b>prune</b> language, how to {{multiply}} intensities, and how to tell {{nothing but the truth}} in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth". The style has become known as the iceberg theory, because, as Baker describes it, in Hemingway's writing the hard facts float above water while the supporting structure, including the symbolism, operates out of sight. Benson believes Hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices to write about life in general—not only his life. The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the [...] "theory of omission". Hemingway believed the writer could describe one thing though an entirely different thing occurs below the surface.|$|E

[...] Paul Smith writes that Hemingway's first stories, collected as In Our Time, showed he was still experimenting with his writing style. He avoided complicated syntax. About 70 percent of the sentences are simple sentences—a childlike syntax without subordination.|$|E

While, there are many approaches <b>to</b> <b>pruning,</b> an alternative approach of averaging over decision trees has not received as much attention. We perform an empirical comparison of pruning with the approach of averaging over decision trees.

2500|$|Salazar Slytherin's wand {{contained}} {{a fragment of}} a basilisk horn, which allowed Slytherin and other parseltongues who possessed it to cast spells with it at a distance by speaking to it in Parseltongue. In the United States, wand cores are created from the horn of river serpents, Wampus hair, Snallygaster heartstring and Jackalope antlers, a practice originated in the 17th century by the first American wandmaker, Isolt Sayre, an Irish immigrant who founded the Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in Massachusetts, and the Slytherin wand's last owner. She buried it outside the school grounds, and within a year, an unknown species of snakewood tree grew from the burial spot. It resisted all attempts <b>to</b> <b>prune</b> or kill it, but after several years the leaves were found to contain powerful medicinal properties.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to the public outcry, the LAUSD held meetings to determine {{what would happen to}} the trees. Walter Warriner, the Arborist of the city of Santa Monica proposed installing Rubbersidewalks by Rubbersidewalks, Inc., which could be easily lifted in order <b>to</b> <b>prune</b> the tree roots for maintenance. [...] After months of negations, the LAUSD decided not to remove the trees and agreed to install Rubbersidewalks, making University High School the first high school in the United States to use Rubbersidewalks in order to preserve its trees. Installation for the Rubbersidewalks started on November 20, 2003, over a year after the LAUSD had originally condemned the trees.Installation of the Rubbersidewalks was covered by Huell Howser for California's Gold. The episode covering Uni High's Rubbersidewalks aired on KCET on January 28, 2004. Rubber asphalt was also used to repave the pushed up concrete in the teachers' parking lot.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2016, J.K.

This secret was handed down through the centuries to each member of Slytherin’s family who possessed it. By the 1600s it belonged to the Irish witch Gormlaith Gaunt, though in about 1620 it was stolen by her then-17-year old niece Isolt Sayre, who fled to Massachusetts, where she founded the Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

Los Gatos Creek begins in the Santa Cruz Mountains south of the town and runs through the town parallel to Highway 17 all the way through neighboring Campbell and San Jose to the Guadalupe River, which flows into San Francisco Bay. A walking, jogging, and biking trail called the Los Gatos Creek Trail runs alongside much of the creek from Lexington Dam through Vasona Park and Campbell to Meridian Avenue in San Jose. In Los Gatos, the trail passes the 1854 Forbes Mill.|$|E
2500|$|Hemingway {{started as}} a {{journalist}} and writer of short stories, and Baker suggests that he thus learned how to [...] "get the most from the least, how <b>to</b> <b>prune</b> language, how to multiply intensities, and how to tell {{nothing but the truth}} in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth". The style is known as the Iceberg Theory because in Hemingway's writing the hard facts float above water; the supporting structure, complete with symbolism, operates out-of-sight. The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the [...] "theory of omission." [...] Hemingway believed that a writer could describe one thing, while an entirely different thing occurs below the surface. Baker calls Across the River and into the Trees a [...] "lyric-poetical novel" [...] in which each scene has an underlying truth presented via symbolism. According to Meyers, an example of omission is that Renata, like other heroines in Hemingway's fiction, suffers a major [...] "shock"—the murder of her father and the subsequent loss of her home—to which Hemingway alludes only briefly. Hemingway's pared down narrative forces the reader to solve connections—as Stoltzfus has written: [...] "Hemingway walks the reader to the bridge that he or she must cross alone without the narrator's help." ...|$|E
