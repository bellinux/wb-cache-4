5|$|Gliese 581 is {{classified}} as a variable star of the BY Draconis type, and has been given the variable star designation HO Librae. This is a star that exhibits variability {{because of the presence}} of star spots combined with the rotation of the star. However, the measured variability is close to <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>error,</b> and, if real, is most likely a long term variability. Its brightness is stable to 1%. Gliese 581 emits X-rays.|$|E
5|$|In two years, a {{very precise}} map, drawn on six sheets at a 1/200,000 scale, was produced. In March 1829, {{a base of}} 3,500 meters had been traced in the Argolis, from one angle at the ruins of Tiryns to an angle of a house in ruins {{in the village of}} Aria. This was {{intended}} to serve as a point of departure in all the triangulation operations for topographic and geodesic readings in the Peloponnese. Pierre Peytier and Puillon-Boblaye proceeded to perform numerous verifications on the base and on the rulers used. <b>The</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> was thus reduced to 1 meter for every 15 kilometers. The longitude and latitude of the base point at Tiryns were read and checked, so that again <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> was reduced as far as possible to an estimated 0.2 seconds. 134 geodesic stations were set up on the peninsula’s mountains, as well as on Aegina, Hydra and Nafplion. Thus, equilateral triangles whose sides measured about 20km were drawn. The angles were measured with theodolites by Gambey.|$|E

5|$|Astronomers {{define the}} {{metallicity}} {{of a star}} as the abundance of chemical elements that have a higher atomic number than helium. This is measured by a spectroscopic analysis of the atmosphere, followed by a comparison with the results expected from computed stellar models. In the case of IK Pegasus A, the estimated metal abundance is  = +0.07 ± 0.20. This notation gives the logarithm of the ratio of metal elements (M) to hydrogen (H), minus the logarithm of the Sun's metal ratio. (Thus if the star matches the metal abundance of the Sun, this value will be zero.) A logarithmic value of 0.07 is equivalent to an actual metallicity ratio of 1.17, so the star is about 17% richer in metallic elements than the Sun. However <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> for this result is relatively large.|$|E
25|$|To {{adjust for}} a large {{sampling}} fraction, the fpc factored into the calculation of <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>error,</b> which {{has the effect of}} narrowing <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>error.</b> It holds that the fpc approaches zero as the sample size (n) approaches the population size (N), which has the effect of eliminating <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> entirely. This makes intuitive sense because when N = n, the sample becomes a census and sampling error becomes moot.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> for a {{particular}} individual percentage will usually be smaller than the maximum margin of error quoted for the survey.

2500|$|In other words, <b>the</b> maximum <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> is <b>the</b> {{radius of}} a 95% {{confidence}} interval for a reported percentage of 50%.

30|$|Core 255 assemblage-based {{temperatures}} were reconstructed {{using both}} FP- 12 E and SIMMAX- 28 (Fig.  4 i) (Jian et al. 2000). The assemblage summer core-top temperature estimates obtained using FP- 12 E and SIMMAX- 28 were 29.0 and 28.8  °C, respectively, {{both of which}} were consistent with the observed August SST (28.9  °C) within <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> <b>of</b> ± 1.46  °C for FP- 12 E and ± 0.45  °C for SIMMAX- 28.

40|$|The American Community Survey (ACS) is {{the largest}} survey of US {{households}} and is the principal source for neighborhood scale information about the US population and economy. The ACS is used to allocate billions in federal spending and is a critical input to social scientific research in the US. However, estimates from the ACS can be highly unreliable. For example, in over 72 % of census tracts, the estimated number of children under 5 in poverty has a <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> greater than <b>the</b> estimate. Uncertainty of this magnitude complicates the use of social data in policy making, research, and governance. This article presents a heuristic spatial optimization algorithm that is capable <b>of</b> reducing <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> in survey data via {{the creation of new}} composite geographies, a process called regionalization.
