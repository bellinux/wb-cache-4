5|$|Ariel, a sixteen-year-old mermaid princess, is {{dissatisfied}} with underwater {{life in the}} kingdom of Atlantica, and is curious about the human world. With her best friend Flounder, Ariel collects human artifacts in her grotto, and often goes to the surface of <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>to</b> visit Scuttle, a seagull who offers very inaccurate knowledge of human culture. She ignores the warnings of her father King Triton, the ruler of Atlantica, and Sebastian, a crab who serves as Triton's adviser and court composer, that contact between merpeople and humans is forbidden.|$|E
5|$|Following {{several months}} of coastal operations, Orizaba, now armed with two guns and four guns, {{departed}} New York in April 1942 on the first transatlantic run of her second world war. Sailing via Iceland, she steamed to England, Cape Town, Recife, and Norfolk, Virginia, from which she got underway for Bermuda and Puerto Rico. Returning to Norfolk in January 1943, she plied the eastern seaboard for a month, then took up transatlantic duties again. Until July she traversed <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>to</b> Oran, Algeria, carrying troops over and prisoners of war back to New York.|$|E
5|$|About {{nine hours}} after Ernesto became a {{tropical}} storm, {{the government of}} Haiti issued a tropical storm watch from its border with the Dominican Republic to the southwestern tip of the country. As the storm strengthened, the watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning, and about 15hours prior to its closest approach the warning was replaced with a hurricane warning. Several low-lying citizens in Gonaïves were evacuated after local meteorologists anticipated up to 20inches (500mm) of rain in some mountainous areas. Additionally, authorities advised residents in shanty towns near <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>to</b> evacuate to emergency shelters.|$|E

5|$|Europa has the smoothest {{surface of}} any known solid {{object in the}} Solar System. The {{apparent}} youth and smoothness of the surface {{have led to the}} hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it, which could conceivably harbor extraterrestrial life. The predominant model suggests that heat from tidal flexing causes <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>to</b> remain liquid and drives ice movement similar to plate tectonics, absorbing chemicals from the surface into the ocean below. Sea salt from a subsurface ocean may be coating some geological features on Europa, suggesting that the ocean is interacting with the seafloor. This may be important in determining if Europa could be habitable. In addition, the Hubble Space Telescope detected water vapor plumes similar to those observed on Saturn's moon Enceladus, which are thought to be caused by erupting cryogeysers.|$|E
5|$|In 1896 Henry Morrison Flagler {{brought the}} Florida East Coast Railway to Miami. Mary Ann and William Davis {{had dreamed of}} {{building}} a city on Key Biscayne. Now their son Waters was a retired millionaire, and interested only in preserving Key Biscayne as a quiet retreat for his family. For a while Flagler's arrival did disturb their quiet, as Flagler brought in dredges to deepen the Cape Florida Channel and the approaches {{to the mouth of}} the Miami River, muddying the formerly clear waters of Biscayne Bay. Soon, however, a shorter route from <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>to</b> Miami was dredged through the southern end of what is now Miami Beach, at Government Cut, and the Cape Florida Channel was allowed to return to a natural state.|$|E
5|$|Islands is an American {{animated}} miniseries {{based on}} the show Adventure Time by Pendleton Ward. It aired {{as part of the}} show's eighth season on Cartoon Network from January 30, 2017, to February 2, 2017. Adventure Time follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape, grow and shrink at will. In this limited event series, Finn, Jake, BMO (voiced by Niki Yang) and Susan Strong (voiced by Jackie Buscarino) leave Ooo and travel across <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>to</b> solve the mystery of Finn's past. During their trip, they encounter various creatures, new friends, and a variety of mysterious islands. The trip culminates with a visit to Founder's Island, where Finn meets his biological mother, Minerva Campbell (voiced by Sharon Horgan), and discovers what happened to the remainder of the human race.|$|E

5|$|Link is rescued at Windfall Island by {{a talking}} boat, the King of Red Lions, who {{explains}} that the bird's master is a returned Ganon. To defeat him, Link must find the Hero of Time's power, which requires the three Pearls of the Goddesses. Link finds Din's Pearl on Dragon Roost Island, home of the avian Rito and the dragon Valoo; Farore's Pearl in Forest Haven, home of the Great Deku Tree and the plant-like Koroks; and Nayru's Pearl with the water spirit Jabun on Outset Island. The King of Red Lions then takes Link to the Tower of the Gods, where he faces trials before descending beneath <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>to</b> a castle suspended in time.

5|$|Monterey Bay Aquarium {{plays an}} active role in federal and state politics, from {{sponsoring}} governmental legislation about <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>to</b> persuading voter action from its visitors and online followers. The aquarium was a leading sponsor for the statewide shark fin ban in 2011. After the ban’s success the aquarium shifted its efforts to focus on ocean plastic pollution. It produced advertisements, webpages, and podcasts in 2016 in support of California Proposition 67 for a statewide ban on single-use plastic grocery bags. The aquarium hosted a plastic pollution symposium through the Aquarium Conservation Partnership in December 2016, and, in July 2017, the aquarium {{and other members of the}} partnership began eliminating their own plastic products.|$|E

5|$|Tides cause {{seawater}} {{to enter}} {{the mouth of the}} St. Johns River and can affect the river's level into the middle basin. As a result, much of the river in Jacksonville is part seawater, making it an estuarine ecosystem. The animals and plants in these systems can tolerate both fresh and salt water, and the fluctuations in saline content and temperatures associated with tidal surges and heavy rainfall discharge. Marine animals such as dolphins and sharks can be spotted at times in the St. Johns at Jacksonville as can manatees. Fish such as mullet (Mullidae), flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma), shad (Alosa sapidissima), and blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) migrate from <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>to</b> freshwater springs upriver to spawn.|$|E
5|$|On 30 March 1805, the French Mediterranean Fleet under Vice-Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve {{successfully}} {{broke out}} of Toulon harbour, avoiding the British blockade fleet under Vice-Admiral Lord Nelson and sailing westwards out of the Mediterranean and into the Atlantic, Nelson following several days behind. Villeneuve, joined by a Spanish squadron, crossed <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>to</b> the Caribbean and anchored at Martinique, while Nelson arrived at Barbados on 11 June. Panicked by the British arrival, Villeneuve immediately returned to Europe, with Nelson again close behind. Villeneuve's orders had specified that he sail to Brest, the French naval port on the Bay of Biscay, and join there with the fleet under Vice-Admiral Honoré Ganteaume. Together this force would drive the Royal Navy out of the English Channel in preparation for an invasion of Britain. However, as he passed the Spanish port of Ferrol on 22 July 1805, Villeneuve was intercepted by a British fleet under Vice-Admiral Sir Robert Calder. At the ensuing Battle of Cape Finisterre, Calder captured two Spanish ships but failed to inflict a decisive blow on Villeneuve's squadron, which later sailed to Cadiz, Spain's principal Atlantic seaport. Nelson arrived shortly afterwards and initiated a blockade of the port.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{analyzing}} the unique cracks lining Europa found evidence showing that it likely spun around a tilted axis {{at some point}} in time. If correct, this would explain many of Europa's features. Europa's immense network of crisscrossing cracks serves as a record of the stresses caused by massive tides in its global ocean. Europa's tilt could influence calculations of how much of its history is recorded in its frozen shell, how much heat is generated by tides in its ocean, and even how long the ocean has been liquid. Its ice layer must stretch to accommodate these changes. When there is too much stress, it cracks. A tilt in Europa's axis could suggest that its cracks may be much more recent than previously thought. The reason is that the direction of the spin pole may change by as much as a few degrees per day, completing one precession period over several months. A tilt also could affect the estimates of the age of Europa's ocean. Tidal forces are thought to generate the heat that keeps Europa's ocean liquid, and a tilt in the spin axis means that more heat is generated by tidal forces. This heat helps <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>to</b> remain liquid longer. Scientists did not specify when the tilt would have occurred and measurements have not been made of the tilt of Europa's axis.|$|E

40|$|Constraints on the {{availability}} of freshwater and land plants and animals to feed the 9. 2 billion humans projected to inhabit Earth by 2050 can be overcome by enhancing <b>the</b> contribution <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> makes <b>to</b> food production. Catches from ocean fisheries are unlikely to recover without adequate conservation measures, so the greater contribution of <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> <b>to</b> feeding humanity must be derived largely from mariculture. For the effort to be successful, mariculture must close the production cycle to abandon its current dependence on fisheries catches; enhance the production of edible macroalgae and filter-feeder organisms; minimize environmental impacts; and increase integration with food production on land, transferring water-intensive components of the human diet (i. e., production of animal protein) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean.</b> Accommodating these changes will enable <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> <b>to</b> become a major source of food, which we believe will constitute the next food revolution in human history. © 2009 by American Institute of Biological Sciences.

5|$|The {{first modern}} wave of {{economic}} globalization began {{during the period}} of 1870–1914, marked by transportation expansion, record levels of migration, enhanced communications, trade expansion, and growth in capital transfers. During the mid-nineteenth century, the passport system in Europe dissolved as rail transport expanded rapidly. Most countries issuing passports did not require their carry, thus people could travel freely without them. The standardization of international passports would not arise until 1980 under the guidance of the United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization. From 1870 to 1915, 36 million Europeans migrated away from Europe. Approximately 25 million (or 70%) of these travelers migrated to the United States, while most of the rest reached Canada, Australia, Argentina, and Brazil. Europe itself experienced an influx of foreigners from 1860 to 1910, growing from 0.7% of the population to 1.8%. While the absence of meaningful passport requirements allowed for free travel, migration on such an enormous scale would have been prohibitively difficult if not for technological advances in transportation, particularly the expansion of railway travel and the dominance of steam-powered boats over traditional sailing ships. World railway mileage grew from 205,000 kilometers in 1870 to 925,000 kilometers in 1906, while steamboat cargo tonnage surpassed that of sailboats in the 1890s. Advancements such as the telephone and wireless telegraphy (the precursor to radio) revolutionized telecommunication by providing instantaneous communication. In 1866, the first transatlantic cable was laid beneath <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>to</b> connect London and New York, while Europe and Asia became connected through new landlines.|$|E
