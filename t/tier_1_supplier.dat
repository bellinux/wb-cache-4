40|$|Preliminary and incomplete] I discuss {{three issues}} that have deeply {{influenced}} the North American automobile industry in the last decades. Proliferation of models and vehicle types has reduced the average sales per vehicle with important consequences on the manufacturing side. Manufacturers have responded by adopting flexible production technology in their assembly plants. One {{of the most important}} features of the flexible technology is the ability to build a variety of platforms and body styles on the same assembly line. They have also reorganized their supply chain. Increased outsourcing of components, even sharing the burden of research and development with preferred (<b>tier</b> <b>1)</b> <b>suppliers,</b> and just-in-time inventory management are the most visible exponents of this transformation. These three trends are discussed with an eye to their interrelatedness, the impact on industrial performance, and policy options available to Canada.

40|$|A <b>tier</b> <b>1</b> {{automotive}} <b>supplier</b> {{has developed}} a novel and unique kinetic energy recovery storage system for both retro-fitting and OEM application for public transport systems where periodic stop start behaviour is paramount. A major component {{of the system is}} a composite flywheel spinning at up to 36, 000 rpm (600 Hz). Material soundness is an essential requirement of the flywheel to ensure failure does not occur. The component is particularly thick for a composite being up to 30 mm cross section in some places. The geometry, scale and material make-up pose some challenges for conventional NDT systems. Damage can arise in composite materials during material processing, fabrication of the component or in-service activities among which delamination, cracks and porosity are the most common defects. A number of non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques are effective in testing components for defects without damaging the component. NDT techniques like Ultrasonic Testing, X-Ray, Radiography, Thermography, Eddy current and Acoustic Emission are current techniques for various testing applications. Each of these techniques uses different principles to look into the material for defects. However, the geometry, physical and material properties of the component being tested are important factors in the applicability of a technique.

The study also aims to analyze differences between different tiers of this supply chain and {{to examine the relationship between}} the implementation of quality management systems and adoption of TQM. Design/methodology/approach – A total of 165 datasets collected from ASEAN automotive Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and their <b>tier</b> <b>1</b> and 2 <b>suppliers</b> in five ASEAN countries were tested by using cross-tabulation analysis and ANOVA with post hoc test. Findings – The results show that firms that have successfully implemented the concept of work standardization or process-approach through quality management systems (QMS) certification have tended to pursue TQM as the subsequent stage in their quality journey. In addition, the study found that all seven TQM practices – leadership; strategy and planning; customer focus; information and analysis; people management; process management; and supplier involvement – were significantly higher in TQM firms than in non-TQM firms.

40|$|We study {{sourcing}} {{decisions in}} {{a supply chain}} with three levels: Tier 2 suppliers that sell to Tier <b>1</b> <b>suppliers,</b> Tier <b>1</b> <b>suppliers</b> that sell to a manufacturer, and a manufacturer that sells finished goods to the market. The suppliers in Tier 2 are prone to independent disruption risk due to, e. g., natural disasters such as earthquakes or floods. The manufacturer may not directly dictate which Tier 2 suppliers are used, but may influence the sourcing decisions of Tier <b>1</b> <b>suppliers</b> via the contract parameters it offers to Tier <b>1</b> <b>suppliers.</b> We show that the manufacturer’s optimal sourcing strategy depends critically {{on the degree of}} overlap in the upper levels of the supply chain: generally speaking, as overlap in Tier 2 increases (i. e., as Tier <b>1</b> <b>suppliers</b> have more Tier 2 suppliers in common), the manufacturer should rely less on direct mitigation (procuring excess inventory and multi-sourcing in Tier 1) and rely more on indirect mitigation (increasing the price offered to Tier <b>1</b> <b>suppliers</b> to induce them to procure excess inventory and multi-source). We demonstrate that, predictably, a supply chain with no overlap (Tier <b>1</b> <b>suppliers</b> share no Tier 2 suppliers) yields the greatest profit for the manufacturer; surprisingly, however, a supply chain in which Tier <b>1</b> <b>suppliers</b> share their most reliable (but still prone to disruption) Tier 2 suppliers performs equally well in many cases, implying that it is most important for a manufacturer to ensure its Tier <b>1</b> <b>suppliers</b> are diversified amongst their riskiest Tier 2 suppliers.
