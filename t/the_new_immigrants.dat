5|$|Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold {{starting}} in the 1880s, and the Republican governments provided jobs and assistance for <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>immigrants</b> {{in return for their}} votes. But the Great Depression {{starting in}} 1929 ruined the GOP in the city. The Democratic victory of 1932 meant an end to Republican patronage jobs and assistance. As the Depression worsened, Pittsburgh ethnics voted heavily for the Democrats, especially in 1934, making the city a stronghold of the New Deal Coalition. By 1936, Democratic programs for relief and jobs, especially the WPA, were so popular with the ethnics that a large majority voted for the Democrats.|$|E

For these people the most important factor was material well-being; they cared little about the homeland from which they had fled. Almost all of them assimilated into the Czech population. Many of them settled in Ostrava (west of the ethnic border), as heavy industry was spread through the whole western part of Cieszyn Silesia. Even today, ethnographers find that about 25,000 people in Ostrava (about 8% of the population) have Polish surnames.|$|E

5|$|From 1848, the {{national}} {{consciousness of the}} local people grew and from 1848 {{to the end of}} the 19th century local Poles and Czechs co-operated, uniting against the Germanizing tendencies of the Austrian Empire, and later of Austria-Hungary. Various Polish clubs were founded. Most schools were Polish, followed by German and Czech. At the end of the century, ethnic tensions appeared as the area's economic significance grew. This growth caused a wave of immigration from Galicia, when about 60,000 people arrived and settled between 1880 and 1910. They settled mainly in the Ostrau region, but also in Zaolzie. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>immigrants</b> were Polish and poor, about half of them being illiterate, and worked mostly in coal mining and metallurgy. For these people, the most important factor was material well-being; they cared little about the homeland from which they had fled, more readily assimilating into the Czech population which was demographically dominant in the Ostrava region in the heart of Czech Silesia. The social structure of the territory was generally divided along ethnic lines. Germans were economically strongest, mostly owners, Czechs were mostly clerks and other officials, and Poles were mostly manual workers, miners, and metallurgists. This structure had changed over time but in 1921 it was still very similar, with 61.5% of Poles working as labourers.|$|E

25|$|In two {{or three}} generations, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>immigrants</b> {{themselves}} began to speak French.

From 1842, Dutch was removed from the first four years of boys' schools, although in later school grades it could be studied. In girls' schools and Catholic schools Dutch was taught even less, even though Dutch was still the native tongue of a majority of the students.|$|E
25|$|Between 1948 and 1952, about 700,000 {{immigrants}} {{arrived in}} the new state. The Jewish Agency helped these immigrants acclimate to Israel and begin to build new lives. It established schools to teach them Hebrew, beginning with Ulpan Etzion in 1949. (The first student to register for Ulpan Etzion was Ephraim Kishon.) It also provided them with food, housing, and vocational training.

25|$|Milwaukee's {{founding}} fathers {{had a vision}} for the city: they knew it was perfectly situated as a port city, a center for collecting and distributing produce. Many of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>immigrants</b> who were pouring into the new state of Wisconsin {{during the middle of the}} 19th century were wheat farmers. By 1860, Wisconsin was the second ranked wheat-growing state in the country and Milwaukee shipped more wheat than any place in the world. Railroads were needed to transport all this grain from the wheat fields of Wisconsin to Milwaukee's harbor. Improvements in railways at the time made this possible.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, {{the second}} {{generation}} Chinese Americans generally {{moved out of the}} old Chinatown and into the San Gabriel Valley suburbs, joining <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>immigrants</b> from Taiwan and Mainland China. From that time, with a combined influx of Vietnamese, Taiwanese and Hong Kong immigrant students at the time, Mark Keppel High School, constructed during the New Deal era and located in Alhambra, but also serving most of Monterey Park and portions of Rosemead, felt the impact of this new immigration as the student population increased dramatically, leading to overcrowding. Today, many students are second- or third-generation Asian Americans. In the Japanese community called: Nisei, (second-generation), Sansei, (third-generation).|$|E
25|$|As Perak {{continued}} to increase its mining operations, it suffered a shortage of labour.

Two of the largest were Ghee Hin and Hai San. These two groups regularly tried to increase their influence in Perak and this resulted in frequent skirmishes.

25|$|By {{the late}} 1850s and early 1860s, these colliers {{were joined by}} groups of Irish farmers who had immigrated to America after the devastating potato famine in their homeland. The Irish were {{generally}} unskilled {{in the field of}} mining and so received the lowest-skilled, lowest-paying jobs. Over time, the Irish learned the skills of mining and moved into better-paying, higher-skilled jobs. By the time of the 1880s and 1890s, the low-skill jobs were being taken by the new wave of immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe. These groups included peoples from Slovakia, Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, and Italy. Once again, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>immigrants</b> took many years to develop the knowledge and skills to move into the higher-skilled positions in the colliery.|$|E
25|$|Despite initial interdictions {{under the}} Russian {{occupation}} of 1829 (when {{it was first}} regulated that non-Christians {{were not to be}} regarded as citizens), many of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>immigrants</b> became leaseholders of estates and tavern-keepers, serving to increase both the revenue and demands of boyars - leading in turn to an increase in economic pressures over those working the land or buying products (usual prejudice against Jews accused tavern-keepers of encouraging alcoholism). At the same time, several Jews rose to prominence and high social status - most families involved in Moldavian banking around the 1850s were of Jewish origin. After 1832, following adoption of the Organic Statute, Jewish children are accepted in schools in the two Principalities only if they wore the same clothing as others. In Moldavia, authorities forced the community to abandon its traditional dress code through the 1847 decree of Prince Mihail Sturdza.|$|E
25|$|The {{clothing}} industry in New York City was staffed by many immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe. Historian Witold Kula {{found that many}} Jewish immigrants, and to a much lesser extent, Italians, were identified upon their arrival to the United States as having work background as tailors {{even if they did}} not. Kula identified several letters written by Jewish immigrants back to their families in Poland indicating that they were just learning the trade, when in fact, they had papers stating that it was their native profession. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>immigrants</b> generally did not speak English nor did the immigration agents speak any Polish, Yiddish, or Italian. Kula suggests that the Immigration agents were influenced by the demands of the workforce and essentially staffed the industries based on their expectations of each ethnic group. By 1912, the needle trades were the largest employer of Polish Jews in the United States, and 85% of the needle trade employees were Eastern European Jews.|$|E
