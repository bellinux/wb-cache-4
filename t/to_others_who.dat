5|$|The Marshalsea was {{technically}} {{under the}} control of the Knight Marshal, but was let out <b>to</b> <b>others</b> <b>who</b> ran it for profit. For example, in 1727 the Knight Marshal, Philip Meadows, hired John Darby, a printer, as prison governor, who in turn leased it to William Acton, a butcher (who was later tried for murdering three of its prisoners). Acton had previously worked as one of the prison's turnkeys. He paid Darby £140 a year (roughly £) for a seven-year lease, giving him the right to act as resident warden and chief turnkey, and an additional £260 for the right to collect rent from the rooms, and sell food and drink.|$|E

5|$|In May 1809, {{the rebels}} {{captured}} Sjenica. They repulsed an Ottoman {{attack on the}} village of Suvodol in early June, and seized Novi Pazar later that month, but failed to take its fortress. Lacking numbers and adequate military training, they failed to establish a corridor to Montenegro and never came close to the Adriatic Sea. Karađorđe had described acquiring access to the sea {{as one of his}} key aims. The rebels experienced further setbacks in Niš, where 3,000 were surrounded at Čegar Hill in May–June 1809. Knowing that he and his men would be impaled if captured, rebel commander Stevan Sinđelić fired at his entrenchment's gun powder magazine, setting off a massive explosion that killed him and everyone else in the vicinity. On the site of the battle, the Ottoman commander Hurshid Pasha built a stone tower with the skulls of Sinđelić and his fighters embedded in its walls as a warning <b>to</b> <b>others</b> <b>who</b> wished to rebel.|$|E
5|$|Radu is {{interviewed in}} {{this portion of}} the film, as is Tournecuillert, who speaks about his {{experiences}} in Albania, where he heard about the sex trafficking of girls and how some of the girls would be shot or burned to death as a warning to the other girls. He describes how Albanian girls are often rounded up to be sexually trafficked in Italy. He further explains that, normally, before they leave Albania, the traffickers kill one of the girls in front of the others—usually by burning or shooting—to demonstrate what will happen <b>to</b> <b>others</b> <b>who</b> try to escape. Matei adds that, for the sake of amusement, some of the girls would be buried alive with only their heads remaining above ground. Eugenia Bonetti, a nun, speaks about her work helping girls escape from slavery in Italy.|$|E
25|$|In November 2013, Officer Ashley Roane {{pleaded guilty}} to charges related to a scheme to sell Social Security numbers.

25|$|In addition, Pakistan's {{major cities}} and urban centres {{are home to}} an {{estimated}} 1.2 million street children. This includes beggars and scavengers who are often very young. The law and order problem worsens their condition as boys and girls are fair game <b>to</b> <b>others</b> <b>who</b> would force them into stealing, scavenging and smuggling to survive. A large proportion consumes readily available solvents to starve off hunger, loneliness and fear. Children are vulnerable to contracting STDs such as HIV/AIDS, {{as well as other}} diseases.|$|E
25|$|In feu holding {{there is}} a {{substantial}} annual payment in money or in kind in return for the enjoyment of the land.

The Conveyancing (Scotland) Act 1874 rendered any clause in a disposition against subinfeudation null and void.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, Mohanlal, {{trying to}} change his action hero image, returned to comedic roles with Kilichundan Mampazham, Balettan, Hariharan Pillai Happy Aanu and Mr. Brahmachari. Kilichundan Mampazham, promoted as a comeback vehicle for the actor, received good reviews and a decent box-office collection. Balettan, directed by V. M. Vinu, was also a commercial success. Mohanlal {{played the role of}} Athanipparambil Balachandran, a bank employee always willing to lend a helping hand <b>to</b> <b>others,</b> <b>who</b> is forced to hide many secrets after his father's death leading to his family's mistrust. In 2004, Natturajavu was his only commercial success and Mambazhakkalam became a hit.|$|E

25|$|Luther {{produced}} other works: sermons, {{which were}} read in Churches around the Empire; translations of the Bible, primarily the New Testament written in German; doctrine {{on how to}} conduct oneself within the church and society; and a multitude of letters and treatises. Often Luther wrote in response <b>to</b> <b>others</b> <b>who</b> had criticized his works or asked for clarification or justification on an issue. Three of Luther’s major treatises, written in 1520, are To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation, On the Freedom of a Christian, and On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church; these works were significant documents for the Reformation as a whole.|$|E
25|$|In Europe {{and early}} America, ice cream {{was made and}} sold by small businesses, mostly confectioners and caterers. Jacob Fussell of Baltimore, Maryland {{was the first to}} {{manufacture}} ice cream on a large scale. Fussell bought fresh dairy products from farmers in York County, Pennsylvania, and sold them in Baltimore. An unstable demand for his dairy products often left him with a surplus of cream, which he made into ice cream. He built his first ice cream factory in Seven Valleys, Pennsylvania, in 1851. Two years later, he moved his factory to Baltimore. Later, he opened factories in several other cities and taught the business <b>to</b> <b>others,</b> <b>who</b> operated their own plants. Mass production reduced the cost of ice cream and added to its popularity.|$|E
25|$|There is {{one final}} matter to consider: the {{possibility}} that euthanasia not only would be performed on incompetent patients {{in violation of the}} rules—as an abuse of the safeguards—but would become the rule in the context of demographic and budgetary pressures on Social Security and Medicare as the Baby Boom generation begins to retire, around 2010. Once legalized, physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia would become routine. Over time doctors would become comfortable giving injections to end life and Americans would become comfortable having euthanasia as an option. Comfort would make us want to extend the option <b>to</b> <b>others</b> <b>who,</b> in society's view, are suffering and leading purposeless lives. The ethical arguments for physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia, advocates of euthanasia have maintained, do not apply to euthanasia only when it is voluntary; they {{can also be used to}} justify some kinds of nonvoluntary euthanasia of the incompetent.|$|E

25|$|People with ORS misinterpret the {{behavior}} of others {{to be related to}} the imagined odor (thoughts of reference). In one review, ideas of reference were present in 74% of cases. Usually, these involve misinterpretations of comments, gestures and actions of other people such that it is believed that an offensive smell from the individual is being referred to. These thoughts of reference are more pronounced in social situations which the individual with ORS may find stressful, such as public transport, crowded lift, workplace, classroom, etc. Example behaviors which are misinterpreted include coughing, sneezing, turning of the head, opening a window, facial expressions, sniffing, touching nose, scratching head, gestures, moving away, avoiding the person, whistling. Commonly, when being in proximity <b>to</b> <b>others</b> <b>who</b> are talking among themselves, persons with ORS will be convinced that the conversation is about his or her odor. Even the actions of animals (e.g. barking of dogs) can be interpreted as referential to an odor. Persons with ORS may have trouble concentrating at a given task or in particular situations due to obsessive thoughts concerning body odor.|$|E
500|$|In early 2002, {{an article}} in the Daily Telegraph {{described}} the 63-year-old lord, [...] "dressed in leather trousers and open-necked, pink silk shirts, with a gold chain draped around his neck". Shaftesbury had fallen hard for a 29-year-old French model named Nathalie Lions. In 2006, {{an article in}} the Guardian wrote of his relationship with Lions, with whom he would be found [...] "frolicking at Bellini's bar in Kensington, where he liberally wrote cheques and Lions spent them". He refused to listen <b>to</b> <b>others</b> <b>who</b> warned him that she was taking advantage of him.

500|$|Sati, the {{practice}} where a widow would immolate herself with her dead husband's body, is evidenced in Vijayanagara ruins. About fifty inscriptions {{have been discovered}} in Vijayanagara which are called Satikal (Sati stone) or Sati-virakal (Sati hero stone). According to Ashis Nandy, the Vijayanagara practice {{was an example of}} an [...] "epidemic" [...] of sati practice just like Rajput kingdoms under attack by Mughal armies, attributing {{the practice}} to foreign intrusions from the persistent wars between Muslim sultanates and the Hindu kingdom, in contrast <b>to</b> <b>others</b> <b>who</b> question the evidence. According to scholars such as John Hawley, [...] "the evidence about the extent of the custom and about the classes that practiced it is far from clear, since most accounts come from Muslim chroniclers or European travelers" [...] who did not have means and objectivity to report about the practice or its circumstances accurately.|$|E

500|$|One {{point of}} dispute was the {{calculation}} of Malay equity. Although officially, as of 1992, the Malays controlled 18% of the economy, some dismissed this figure as misleading. It was argued that as in reality, much of this amount comprised equity held by government agencies, therefore it belonged to Malaysians as a whole. The practice of awarding public works contracts mainly to Bumiputras was argued to be stifling Malay competency by providing little incentive to improve. Many Bumiputra contractors in turn subcontracted their jobs <b>to</b> <b>others,</b> <b>who</b> were in some cases Chinese; [...] "Ali Baba" [...] arrangements with [...] "the Malay [...] using his privileges to acquire licences and permits denied the non-Malay, then accepting a fee to be the front-man while the non-Malay [...] ran the business," [...] were prevalent.

500|$|Punk adopted his real-life {{following}} of {{the straight}} edge {{movement as a}} major attribute of his professional wrestling character. The character utilizes different elements of Punk's personality and beliefs of the straight edge movement dependent on his alignment. While portraying a crowd favorite, Punk's character tends {{to be that of}} Punk's normal personality, largely indifferent <b>to</b> <b>others</b> <b>who</b> drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, partake in recreational drug use or have promiscuous sexual behavior, but emphasizing the social discipline involved with personally abstaining from these behaviors. Conversely, his villainous personality tends to be that of one who is hardline or militant straight edge, exemplifying the elitist attitudes and superiority complexes—defined by Punk's common mantra during villainous-themed promos that, because he is straight edge, he is [...] "better than you". Punk performs the straight edge symbol of crossing his arms in an X formation while having the letter X written {{on the back of his}} hands, usually drawn on his wrist tape. During his WWE career, Punk also incorporated a belligerently anti-establishment and anti-corporate attitude into his persona.|$|E
500|$|Clarence13X's {{group was}} {{initially}} {{known as the}} [...] "Suns of Almighty God Allah" [...] or the [...] "Blood Brothers". After MalcolmX's death, the group {{became known as the}} [...] "Five Percenters" [...] or the [...] "Five Percent Nation". The name was drawn from the NOI's claim to be the five percent of the black community who knew and promoted the truth about God; Clarence13X considered his movement to be the five percent of the NOI that still held to truth and integrity. The other 95 percent were said to be unaware of the truth or corrupt. Clarence13X assembled an inner circle of assistants, nine of whom are referred to by Five Percenters as the [...] "First Born": they are said to embody his attributes. The assistants were assigned to spread the group's teachings to younger people, many of whom took African names, including some from non-Islamic societies. Clarence13X taught Afrocentrism to his disciples and often wore a dashiki; male Five Percenters members frequently wore tasseled kufis, and female members wore colorful African head wraps. Some Five Percenters supported themselves via drug dealing and petty theft; others intentionally committed minor legal infractions, hoping to proselytize <b>to</b> <b>others</b> <b>who</b> had been arrested.|$|E
