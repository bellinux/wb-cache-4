500|$|Joshua Safran had {{initially}} envisioned Alex {{as the one}} of the protagonists of Quantico. When he was writing the character, his personal struggle with not knowing whether one of his family members was a pathological liar or involved with a government agency helped Safran build Alex's perception of her own family. Safran wrote his own experience into Alex's struggle to learn the truth about her father. He said [...] "I've always struggled with knowing that I would never know the truth, because there is no real such thing as the truth with regard <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> {{may or may not be}} telling the truth.

The project was originally designed as a part of Trenier's promotional strategy to transform D'Angelo's image and public appeal. On the video's concept, Trenier stated, [...] "the idea was, it would feel like one-on-one with whoever the woman was." [...] D'Angelo, who had been under intense physical workout with personal trainer Mark Jenkins, was initially anxious to appear naked in the video upon hearing Trenier's proposal. In a 2008 interview for Spin, Jenkins discussed D'Angelo's reluctance at the time to the idea for the video, stating [...] "You've got to realize, he'd never looked like that before in his life. <b>To</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> was so introverted, and then, in a matter of three or four months, to be so ripped-everything was happening so quickly." ...|$|E
500|$|ArticleVI also {{recognized}} the Prawo o sejmikach, the act on regional assemblies (sejmiks) {{that had been}} passed on March 24, 1791. By reducing the enfranchisement of the noble classes, this law introduced major changes to the electoral ordinance. Previously, all nobles had been eligible to vote in sejmiks, which de facto meant {{that many of the}} poorest, landless noblesknown as [...] "clients" [...] or [...] "clientele" [...] of local magnatesvoted as the magnates bade them. Now the voting right was tied to a property qualification: one had to own or lease land and pay taxes, or be closely related <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> did, to be eligible to vote. 300,000 of 700,000 previously eligible nobles were thus disfranchised, much to their displeasure. Voting rights were restored to landowners who were in military service. They had lost these rights in 1775. Voting was limited to males of at least 18 years of age. The eligible voters elected deputies to local powiats, or county sejmiks, which elected deputies to the General Sejm.|$|E

[...] "It's actually illegal, because they are basically charging me for on-the-job training – in California you can't charge somebody for on-the-job training.

He based protagonist Alex Parrish, whose complex family history haunts her throughout the series, on a relative; Safran wove his own struggle to understand that family member into Alex's desire to learn the truth about her father. Safran said [...] "I have a family member who either is a pathological liar or has been involved with a government agency my whole life. I've always struggled with knowing that I would never know the truth, because there is no real such thing as the truth with regard <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> {{may or may not be}} telling the truth.

2500|$|The historicity of Robin Hood {{has been}} debated for centuries. [...] A {{difficulty}} with any such historical research is that Robert {{was a very}} common given name in medieval England, and 'Robin' (or Robyn), was its very common diminutive, especially in the 13th century; it is a French hypocorism, already mentioned in the Roman de Renart in the 12th century. The surname Hood (or Hude, Hode, etc.) was also fairly common because it referred either to a hooder, who was a maker of hoods, or alternatively <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> wore a hood as a head-covering. Unsurprisingly, therefore, medieval records mention {{a number of people}} called 'Robert Hood' or 'Robin Hood', some of whom are known to have fallen foul of the law.|$|E

His not-guilty plea in series two, Gravelle felt, was also motivated by desperation (rather than a months-long plan to expose the town's secrets).|$|E
