The story was constructed differently than what was popular at the time. There were no villains, violence, or battles between good and evil.

While the studio diary listed 16 days for recording, the album sleeve later claimed the album was recorded in 14 days, while in interviews Buck at times commented that the album was recorded in 11 days.

500|$|With a {{loan from}} the West Bengal government, Ray finally {{completed}} the film. It was released in 1955 to great critical and popular success. It earned numerous prizes and had long runs in both India and abroad. In India, {{the reaction to the}} film was enthusiastic; The Times of India wrote that [...] "It is absurd to compare it with any other Indian cinema [...] Pather Panchali is pure cinema." [...] In the United Kingdom, Lindsay Anderson wrote a glowing review of the film. But, the reaction was not uniformly positive. After watching the movie, François Truffaut is reported to have said, [...] "I don't want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> of peasants eating with their hands." [...] Bosley Crowther, then the most influential critic of The New York Times, wrote a scathing review of the film. Its American distributor Ed Harrison was worried Crowther's review would dissuade audiences, but the film had an exceptionally long run when released in the United States.|$|E
500|$|The {{reaction}} was not uniformly positive. On seeing the film, François Truffaut {{is reported to}} have said, [...] "I don't want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> of peasants eating with their hands." [...] Bosley Crowther, the most influential critic of The New York Times, wrote in 1958, [...] "Any picture as loose in structure or as listless in tempo as this one is would barely pass as a 'rough cut' with the editors in Hollywood", even though he praised its gradually emerging poignancy and poetic quality. The Harvard Crimson argued in 1959 that its fragmentary nature [...] "contributes to the film's great weakness: its general diffuseness, its inability to command sustained attention. For Pather Panchali, remarkable as it may be, is something of a chore to sit through." [...] Early in the 1980s, Ray was criticised by Nargis Dutt, parliamentarian and former actress, for [...] "exporting poverty". Darius Cooper writes that while many critics celebrated the Apu trilogy [...] "as a eulogy of third-world culture, others criticized it for what they took to be its romanticization of such a culture".|$|E
500|$|The feminist {{film critic}} Molly Haskell also wrote an {{approving}} {{review of the}} film in the Village Voice: [...] "In a world, an industry, and particularly a genre which values the new and improved product above all, it {{is nothing short of}} miraculous <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> which dares to go backward, a technological artefact which has nobly deteriorated into a human being. I speak of the new and obsolete James Bond, played by a man named George Lazenby, who seems more comfortable in a wet tuxedo than a dry martini, more at ease as a donnish genealogist than reading (or playing) Playboy, and who actually dares to think that one woman who is his equal is better than a thousand part-time playmates." [...] Haskell was also affected by the film's emotional ending: [...] "The love between Bond and his Tracy begins as a payment and ends as a sacrament. After ostensibly getting rid of the bad guys, they are married. They drive off to a shocking, stunning ending. Their love, being too real, is killed by the conventions it defied. But they win the final victory by calling, unexpectedly, upon feeling. Some of the audience hissed, I was shattered. If you like your Bonds with happy endings, don't go." ...|$|E

500|$|Although {{the film}} is not {{essentially}} experimental, at several points it undermines the narrative reality. James Bernardoni notes Allen's way of opening the film by facing the camera, which immediately intrudes upon audience involvement in the film. In one famous scene, Allen's character, in line <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> with Annie, listens to a man behind him deliver misinformed pontifications on the significance of Fellini's and Marshall McLuhan's work. Allen pulls McLuhan himself from just off camera to personally correct the man's errors. Later in the film, when we see Annie and Alvy in their first extended talk, [...] "mental subtitles" [...] convey to the audience the characters' nervous inner doubts. An animated scene—with artwork based on the comic strip Inside Woody Allen—depicts Alvy and Annie {{in the guise of}} the Wicked Queen from Snow White. Although Allen uses each of these techniques only once, the [...] "fourth wall" [...] is broken several other times when characters address the camera directly. In one, Alvy stops several passers-by to ask questions about love, and in another he shrugs off writing a happy ending to his relationship with Annie in his autobiographical first play as forgivable [...] "wish-fulfillment." [...] Allen chose to have Alvy break the fourth wall, he explained, [...] "because I felt many {{of the people in the}} audience had the same feelings and the same problems. I wanted to talk to them directly and confront them." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{film was}} praised for its stylistic innovations. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times stated: [...] "It smashes {{down the walls}} of habit that {{surround}} so many movies.

[...] Edward Guthmann from the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, [...] "It's great <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> so courageous and affecting, so committed to its own differentness." [...] However, criticism was directed at its storyline. Jonathan Foreman of the New York Post described the film as [...] "meretricious fakery" [...] and called it [...] "so unrelenting in its manipulative sentimentality that, {{if it had been}} made by an American and shot in a more conventional manner, it would be seen as a bad joke." ...|$|E
