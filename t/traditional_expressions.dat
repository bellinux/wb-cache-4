This study {{examines}} {{the utility of}} employing digit concate-nation, as distinct from the <b>traditional</b> <b>expression</b> based approach, {{for the purpose of}} evolving constants in Grammatical Evolution. Digit con-catenation involves creating constants (either whole or real numbers) by concatenating digits to form a single value. The two methods are compared using three different problems, which are finding a static real constant, finding dynamic real constants, and a quadratic map, which on iteration generates a chaotic time-series. The results indicate that the digit concatenation approach results in a significant improvement in the best fitness obtained across all problems analysed here. ...|$|R
