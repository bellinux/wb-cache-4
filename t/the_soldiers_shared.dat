During Operation Tempest the Regiment was recreated and {{took part in the}} Warsaw Uprising. The soldiers of the regiment fought in the failed uprising in Praga, but also in heavy fights for the boroughs of Żoliborz, Mokotów and Czerniaków. It was officially recreated by order of Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski out of three previously-existing partisan battalions. Led by Maj. Stanisław Błaszczak (nom de guerre Róg), it was composed of the Krybar (Cyprian Odorkiewicz), Dowgierd (Stanisław Taczanowski) and Żmudzin (Bolesław Kontrym) battalions, each named after their commanders' noms de guerre. After the capitulation of the Uprising, <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>shared</b> the fate {{of the rest of the}} Armia Krajowa. The Regiment was not recreated after the war and its banner, founded in 1921 by the universities of Warsaw, is currently in the Museum of the Polish Army in Warsaw.|$|E

25|$|Poška {{was born}} in 1903 in the family of farmers in {{northern}} Lithuania, {{in the village of}} Gripkeliai of Pasvalys district. His interest in Esperanto emerged as early as 1913, when he received his first Esperanto textbook as a gift. He learned the language independently and in 1917, during World War I, a German soldier noticed him reading an Esperanto book. <b>The</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>shared</b> addresses of Esperantists and Poška began corresponding with many intellectuals.

50|$|A larger theme, power, is best {{exemplified}} through General Cummings himself. Cummings compares {{himself to}} the “chief monk” and God throughout the book. He also openly supports the class system within the military, ordering Hearn that as an officer he must accept the “emotional prejudices of his class.” People of higher ranks like Hearn and Cummings, after all, enjoy {{a better quality of}} life than <b>the</b> other foot <b>soldiers.</b> They sleep in larger staterooms while <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>share</b> small rooms and are jammed into cots. This power system is reinforced within the missions themselves. After Hearn dies, Croft takes over leading the platoon up the mountain. While <b>the</b> other <b>soldiers</b> clearly want to stop and give up, they continue hiking the mountain simply because their authority figure, Croft, demands that they not give up. Thus, this is another instance where the undemocratic nature of the Army is apparent.|$|R

5000|$|Every new emperor, either {{legal or}} illegal, marked the {{beginning}} of his rule by minting new coins, both for the prestige of declaring oneself as Augustus and to pay <b>the</b> loyal <b>soldiers</b> their <b>share.</b> Thus coinage is often the only evidence of a determined usurpation. But the number of coin types with the effigy of a usurper might not be equal to the total number of usurpations. The presence of minting facilities certainly allowed short term usurpers to release their coinage, but on the other hand, a man capable of sustaining a rebellion {{for a couple of months}} in a remote area might fail to produce his own coins due to the lack of access to the instruments of minting technology.|$|R
25|$|In March 1990 {{a soldier}} {{on leave from}} the 38th army recounted his {{experience}} of suppressing the student demonstrations, claiming that his unit was tricked into opening fire on the protesters.

He was joined by reinforcements from Kufa under the command of Shahab ibn Makharaq, and by Abdullah ibn Utban, the commander of a campaign in Kerman. They encountered no strong resistance in Makran until the army of the Jain King of Rai, along with contingents from Makran and Sind, stopped them near the Indus River. In mid-644 the Battle of Rasil was fought between the forces of the Rashidun Caliphate and the Rai Kingdom; the Raja's forces were defeated and forced to retreat to the eastern bank of the Indus.

50|$|Recently, {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} to identify differentially expressed genes in C. floridanum castes that code for identifiable ions and proteins that <b>the</b> sterile <b>soldiers,</b> for instance, <b>share.</b> <b>Soldiers</b> and reproductive larvae express enzymes with the differential usage of proteinase inhibitors and ribosomal proteins. More specifically, odorant binding proteins (OBPs) are utilized for kin recognition, along with the likely usage of toxin-like and SP genes in <b>the</b> ability of <b>soldiers</b> to murder competitors or as immune defense against potential pathogens. The host's molting cycle plays a significant role in determining the identity of precocious and reproductive larvae. More specifically, the C. floridanum young mature in synchrony with specific phases within the moth’s molting cycle. In the early stages of embryonic development, changes within the host’s developmental program intrinsically influence caste determination.|$|R
