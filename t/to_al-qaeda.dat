AQIM has reportedly formed sleeper cells that are probably connected <b>to</b> an <b>al-Qaeda</b> underground network in Libya, likely as a way, primarily, to secure the supply of arms for its ongoing jihadist operations in Algeria and the Sahel. This report discusses how al-Qaeda and its North African affiliate are using communications media and face-to-face contacts to shift the still-evolving post-revolutionary political and social dynamic in Libya in a direction that is conducive to jihad and hateful of the West.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThere {{is no doubt}} that the 9 / 11 attacks constituted a new terrorism phenomena in terms of sophistication and scale of mayhem. U. S. policy makers had to consider at least three approaches in response to these attacks: the criminology or soft power approach, the war approach, and the root-causes and the battle of ideas approach. The U. S. pursued a total war on terrorism approach not only against al-Qaeda, but also against all other terrorists in world. The war approach that utilized the might of the American military against non-state actors has resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives; millions have been injured and displaced as well. Yet, despite the war approach, al-Qaeda is still posing a great threat to the Unites States and its allies. Additionally, the rate of its attacks against American targets is ever-increasing. These facts force us to reexamine the effectiveness of the war approach nine years after to its commencement. This research examines the effectiveness of the war approach using metrics other than body count. It looks at the effect of the war on al-Qaeda's organizational structure. It major finding is that the war on terrorism has forced <b>al-Qaeda</b> <b>to</b> transform its organizational structures <b>to</b> <b>al-Qaeda's</b> advantage. The war helped <b>al-Qaeda's</b> organization <b>to</b> expand horizontally, creating new organizational mergers and affiliates, as well as making room for radicalizing aspiring jihadists. The organization has changed from a mere terrorist network to a radical social movement with an ideology and a brand name that has presence in more than 70 countries. Two new strategies are necessary <b>to</b> fight <b>al-Qaeda</b> effectively. First, the U. S. needs <b>to</b> distinguish between <b>al-Qaeda</b> and all other types of Islamist activism. The war approach should be limited strictly <b>to</b> fighting <b>al-Qaeda</b> alone. Second, the U. S. could benefit from adopting a "hybrid" approach where national and international legal cooperation is combined with a root causes and soft-power approach <b>to</b> separate <b>al-Qaeda</b> from its potential supporters.
