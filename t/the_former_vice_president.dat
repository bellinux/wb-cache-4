5|$|On July 13, 2012, Cedar Point {{announced}} {{the removal of}} Disaster Transport and Space Spiral. Exactly a month later, Cedar Point announced GateKeeper, the longest wing coaster in the world, which opened on May 11, 2013. Along with GateKeeper, a new main entrance plaza was constructed, replacing the entrance that {{was built in the}} 1960s. It features two -tall support columns that the trains go through. Cedar Point is investing $60 million in its hotel resorts over three years, starting in the 2013–2014 offseason. At the end of the 2013 season, John Hildebrandt retired as the park's general manager and was replaced by Jason McClure, <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> and general manager of Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|They also {{continued}} to abuse {{freedom of the}} press, particularly during the election campaign. Also during the campaign, broadcast stations owned by <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> Jean-Pierre Bemba promoted ethnic hatred. The transitional government continued to restrict freedoms of assembly and movement; government corruption remained pervasive; and security forces restricted non-governmental organizations (NGOs). In addition, societal discrimination against women and ethnic minorities, trafficking in persons, child labor, and lack of protection for workers' rights continued to be pervasive throughout the country.|$|E

On 15 June 2003, the ship returned to Oceania Cruises service, but was renamed Regatta, as the name Insignia had been passed to her sister R One that had also been chartered by Oceania.|$|E
25|$|On February 6, 2017, a trial {{against the}} former {{president}} of the Government of Catalonia Artur Mas, <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> Joana Ortega and the former Catalan education minister Irene Rigau was held by the Supreme Court of Catalan Justice. They are accused of serious civil disobedience and perverting the course of justice for having authorized the unofficial vote on November 9, 2014 in defiance of its prohibition by the Constitutional Court of Spain. Prosecutors were calling for Artur Mas to be disqualified from office for 10 years, while Ortega and Rigau for 9. The trial focused on the events since the suspension decided by the Constitutional Court on November 4, 2014, until the beginning of the popular vote, on November 9.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the past}} 25 years, politicians, {{academics}} and journalists have frequently predicted that disputes over water {{would be a}} source of future wars. Commonly cited quotes include: that of former Egyptian Foreign Minister and former Secretary-General of the United Nations Boutrous Ghali, who forecast, “The next war in the Middle East will be fought over water, not politics”; his successor at the UN, Kofi Annan, who in 2001 said, “Fierce competition for fresh water may well become a source of conflict and wars in the future,” and <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> of the World Bank, Ismail Serageldin, who said the wars of the next century will be over water unless significant changes in governance occurred. The water wars hypothesis had its roots in earlier research carried out on a small number of transboundary rivers such as the Indus, Jordan and Nile. These particular rivers became the focus because they had experienced water-related disputes. Specific events cited as evidence include Israel’s bombing of Syria’s attempts to divert the Jordan’s headwaters, and military threats by Egypt against any country building dams in the upstream waters of the Nile. However, while some links made between conflict and water were valid, they did not necessarily represent the norm.|$|E

25|$|Congress {{reflected}} public opinion, which {{resonated with}} the ideological argument that communism flourishes in poverty. Truman's own prestige and power had been greatly enhanced by his stunning {{victory in the}} 1948 election. Across America, multiple interest groups, including business, labor, farming, philanthropy, ethnic groups, and religious groups, saw the Marshall Plan as an inexpensive solution to a massive problem, noting it would also help American exports and stimulate the American economy as well. Major newspapers were highly supportive, including such conservative outlets as Time Magazine. Vandenberg made sure of bipartisan support on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Solid Democratic South was highly supportive, the upper Midwest was dubious, but heavily outnumbered. The plan was opposed by conservatives in the rural Midwest, who opposed any major government spending program and were highly suspicious of Europeans. The plan also had some opponents on the left, led by Henry A. Wallace, <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President.</b> He said the Plan was hostile to the Soviet Union, a subsidy for American exporters, and sure to polarize the world between East and West. However, opposition against the Marshall Plan was greatly reduced by {{the shock of the}} Communist coup in Czechoslovakia in February 1948. The appointment of the prominent businessman Paul G. Hoffman as director reassured conservative businessmen that the gigantic sums of money would be handled efficiently.|$|E

500|$|Throughout his career, Barkley {{had been}} arguing that athletes {{should not be}} {{considered}} role models. He stated, [...] "A million guys can dunk a basketball in jail; should they be role models?" [...] In 1993, his argument prompted national news when he wrote the text for his [...] "I am not a role model" [...] Nike commercial. Dan Quayle, <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> of the United States, called it a [...] "family-values message" [...] for Barkley's oft-ignored call for parents and teachers to quit looking to him to [...] "raise your kids" [...] and instead be role models themselves.|$|E
500|$|Hobart {{significantly}} {{expanded the}} powers of the vice presidency, becoming a presidential adviser, and taking a leadership role as president of the Senate. [...] Between his advisory and leadership roles, Hobart was perhaps the most influential vice president since Martin Van Buren. [...] Although Magie, writing in 1910, stated that Hobart's death [...] "fixed his memory {{at the height of his}} fame", <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> is today little remembered. [...] According to Hatfield, he is best known for his death, clearing the way for the ascent of [...] New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt, who took Hobart's place on the Republican ticket in 1900 and succeeded as president after McKinley's assassination in 1901.|$|E

500|$|Within days of Rockefeller's announcement, Agnew {{was being}} wooed by {{supporters}} of <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> Richard Nixon, whose {{campaign for the}} Republican nomination was well under way. Agnew had no antagonism towards Nixon, and {{in the wake of}} Rockefeller's withdrawal had indicated that Nixon might be his [...] "second choice". When the two met in New York on March 29 they found an easy rapport. Agnew's words and actions after the April disturbances in Baltimore delighted conservative members of the Nixon camp such as Pat Buchanan, and also impressed Nixon. When on April 30 Rockefeller re-entered the race, Agnew's reaction was cool. He commended the governor as potentially a [...] "formidable candidate" [...] but did not commit his support: [...] "A lot of things have happened since his withdrawal... I think I've got {{to take another look at}} this situation".|$|E
500|$|As {{the general}} {{election}} got underway, the largest hurdle for the campaign was finances. Polling numbers showed Humphrey trailing Nixon, causing donations to decrease. President Johnson refused to {{use the power of}} his office to help raise money, although many speculated that the tardiness of the Convention, scheduled to coincide with Johnson's birthday, contributed to the issue. To stay afloat, several loans were made, which eventually accounted for half of the $11.6 million used by Humphrey throughout {{the general election}}. Campaign workers decided that no money would be spent on radio or television advertising until the final three weeks of the election. In September, President Johnson showed his support for Humphrey by giving what was described as the strongest endorsement of the campaign when he asked Texas Democrats to throw their support behind the Vice President. However, Johnson did not give his official endorsement until an October 10 radio address. Meanwhile, Humphrey campaigned in New York where he labeled Nixon a [...] "Hawk," [...] stating that <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> [...] "wanted to go to war (in Vietnam) in 1954." [...] At a later stop in Buffalo, Humphrey was met by protesters.|$|E
500|$|With {{lessons learned}} from the Sanderson series, Longacre {{proposed}} to issue his own set of biographies illustrated with plates of the subjects. [...] He was on the point of launching this project, having invested $1,000 of his own money (equal to $ today) in preparation, when he learned that James Herring of New York City was planning a similar series. [...] In October 1831, he wrote to Herring, and the two men agreed to work together on The American Portrait Gallery (later called the National Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Americans), published in four volumes between 1834 and 1839. Herring was an artist, but much of the work of illustrating fell to Longacre, who travelled widely in the United States to sketch subjects from life. [...] He again sketched Jackson, who was by now president, as well as former president James Madison, both in July 1833. He met many of the political leaders of the day, who were impressed by his portraits. [...] Among these advocates was <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president,</b> South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun. In July 1832, Niles' Register described a Longacre engraving, [...] "one of the finest specimens of American advancement in the art".|$|E
