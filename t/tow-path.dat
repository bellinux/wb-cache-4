25|$|The canal is {{no longer}} navigable, and is {{maintained}} by the Environment Agency as a main drainage channel. The remains of the lower five lock chambers and the abutments of the <b>tow-path</b> bridge where the River Ancholme towpath crossed the canal are now grade II listed structures. Despite being closed, two narrowboats successfully reached the first lock in 2002.|$|E
25|$|The Camden and Amboy Rail Road and Transportation Company (C) was {{chartered}} on February 4, 1830, on {{the same}} day as the Delaware and Raritan Canal Company, after the two competing companies had come to a compromise. The C and D had the same goals — to connect the Delaware River, serving Philadelphia, with the Raritan River, for access to New York City — one by tried and true <b>tow-path</b> canal with some new innovations to cross the hills and the other by the novel & as yet untried railroad technology then emerging in Europe. Both ventures were considered risky, and both needed right-of-way grants from the legislature along the river's banks, requiring negotiations and design compromises before either could lay claim to a land rights charter.|$|E
60|$|The great ship-canal of Ving-King-Ching, in the Flowery Kingdom, {{seems the}} Mississippi in parts, where, amply flowing between low, vine-tangled banks, flat as <b>tow-paths,</b> it bears the huge {{toppling}} steamers, bedizened and lacquered within like imperial junks.|$|R

A stretch of the Hertford Union Canal leads from the Regent's canal, at a basin {{in the north of}} Mile End to join the River Lea at Old Ford. A further canal, Limehouse Cut, London's oldest, leads from locks at Bromley-by-Bow to Limehouse Basin. Most of the canal <b>tow-paths</b> are open to both {{pedestrians}} and cyclists.|$|R
25|$|Carrick-on-Suir is {{situated}} in the south-eastern corner of South Tipperary, 21 kilometres (13 miles) east of Clonmel and 27 kilometres (17 miles) northwest of Waterford. Most of the town lies north of the river in the townland of Carrig Mór (Big Rock), with {{the remainder of the}} town on the opposite bank in the townland of Carrig Beg (Small Rock). The town is connected to Limerick and Waterford by the N24 road and a rail link. Carrick-on-Suir railway station opened on 15 April 1853. Two trains a day operate to Waterford and two trains a day operate to Limerick Junction via Clonmel, Cahir and Tipperary. There is no train service on Sundays. Several buses also run on this route. There is a recently refurbished riverside walk to Clonmel along a former canal <b>tow-path.</b> This has recently been upgraded and replanted.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few months}} later on 18June 1827 the Reading Mercury noted that [...] "the Substantial Stone Bridge over the River Thames at Shillingford has {{for a long time}} been {{sufficiently}} complete for the [...] passage of travellers and their carriages and it will very shortly be finished in all its ornamental parts". [...] The new bridge was entirely made of stone with three semi-circular river spans, the middle one [...] wide and the flanking pair [...] each. On the Oxfordshire (north) bank was a small <b>tow-path</b> arch and a [...] causeway. The toll-keeper's cottage was located on the downstream side of the Oxfordshire bank.|$|E
2500|$|Cycling {{has always}} been one of the main sports of Brittany, but leisure cycling and the {{infrastructure}} to support it have been growing extremely rapidly. An extensive network of cyclepaths and recommended cycleroutes has opened up all over the region. Some of these are routes using mainly smaller roads and both signposted and maintained by communes individually, but many are based on dedicated cyclepaths often formed by converting disused railway tracks. These help form routes such as 'Vélodyssée' from Roscoff to Nantes and several major routes under the 'V' label (following signs V1, V2 etc.). The old <b>tow-path</b> of the Nantes-Brest canal is now open to cyclists along its entire 385km length though in places (unlike rail-based cyclepaths) it is very meandering and leaving the path will both shorten the distance and provide variety ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A towed-streamer {{technology}} has been developed for mapping placer heavy minerals and dispersed hydrocarbon plumes in the open ocean. The approach uses induced polarization (IP), an electrical measurement that encompasses several different surface-reactive capacitive and electrochemical phenomena, and thus is ideally suited for mapping dispersed or disseminated targets. The application is operated at sea by towing active electrical geophysical streamers behind a ship; a wide area can be covered in three dimensions by folding <b>tow-paths</b> over each other in lawn-mower fashion. This {{technology has}} already been proven in laboratory and ocean settings to detect IP-reactive titanium- and rare-earth (REE) minerals such as ilmenite and monazite. By extension, minerals that weather and accumulate/concentrate by a similar mechanism, including gold, platinum, and diamonds, may be rapidly detected an...|$|R
5000|$|Schuylkill Canal is the common, but {{technically}} inaccurate, {{name for}} the Schuylkill Navigation, a 19th-century commercial waterway in and along the Schuylkill River in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. The [...] "canal" [...] was actually a system of interconnected canals and slack-water pools in the river, which is called a navigation. Chartered in 1815, the Schuylkill Navigation opened in 1825 to provide transportation and water power. At the time, the river was the least expensive and most efficient method of transporting bulk cargo, and the eastern seaboard cities of the U.S. were experiencing an energy crisis due to over forestation. It fostered the mining of anthracite coal as {{the major source of}} industry between Pottsville and eastern markets. Along the <b>tow-paths,</b> mules pulled barges of coal from Port Carbon through the water gaps to Pottsville; locally to the port and markets of Philadelphia; and some then by ship or through additional New Jersey waterways, to New York City markets.|$|R
60|$|And {{soon after}} a constable {{came up and}} asked me {{to go down to the}} river. He said there'd been an accident.... She was dead. A man had seen her walk along the <b>tow-path</b> and throw herself in.|$|E
6000|$|... “What {{have you}} {{been trying to do}} with it, make a fishing-net of it? You’ve made a nice mess you have; why couldn’t you wind it up properly, you silly dummy?” he grunts from time to time as he struggles wildly with it, and lays it out flat on the <b>tow-path,</b> and runs round and round it, trying to find the end.|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{they are}} out of town the men pull the boats along the canals by means of a long cord, which is {{fastened}} to a strap over their shoulders. With this strap they walk along on the <b>tow-path</b> of the canal, pulling in this way--so that if the cord should break, I should think they would fall headlong on the ground.|$|E
60|$|There was no languor in her now. She {{had dressed}} in white, {{and now she}} took a blue silk cloak with a hood, and caught up the flower that had so {{miraculously}} survived last night's wearing and pinned it at her breast. Then making sure no servant was about, she slipped downstairs and out. It was just eight, and the sun still glistened on the dove-cot. She kept away from that lest the birds should come fluttering about her, and betray her by cooing. When she had nearly reached the <b>tow-path,</b> she stopped affrighted. Surely something had moved, something heavy, with a sound of broken branches. Was it the memory of last night come on her again; or, indeed, someone there? She walked back a few steps. Foolish alarm! In the meadow beyond a cow was brushing against the hedge. And, stealing along the grass, out on to the <b>tow-path,</b> she went swiftly towards the poplar.|$|E
6000|$|We {{struck the}} <b>tow-path</b> at length, {{and that made}} us happy; because prior to this we had not been sure whether we were walking towards the river or away from it, and when you are tired and {{want to go to}} bed {{uncertainties}} like that worry you. We passed Skiplake as the clock was striking the quarter to twelve; and then George said, thoughtfully: ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Bitterly.] Oh, don't be afraid, I haven't got the pluck.... I {{was afraid}} to go on living. I thought if I killed myself {{it would be a}} {{reparation}} for her death. I went down to the river, and I walked along the <b>tow-path</b> to the same spot--but I couldn't do it. The water looked so black and cold and pitiless. And yet she did it so easily. She just walked along and threw herself in. [A pause.] Then I came back, and I thought I'd shoot myself.|$|E
60|$|Beautiful country houses, with clocks {{and long}} lines of {{shuttered}} windows, and fine old trees standing in groves and avenues, gave a rich and sombre aspect {{in the rain and}} the deepening dusk to the shores of the canal. I seem to have seen something of the same effect in engravings: opulent landscapes, deserted and overhung with the passage of storm. And throughout we had the escort of a hooded cart, which trotted shabbily along the <b>tow-path,</b> and kept at an almost uniform distance in our wake.|$|E
60|$|Another {{example of}} the {{dangerous}} want of sympathy between tower and towed was witnessed by George and myself once up near Walton. It was where the <b>tow-path</b> shelves gently down into the water, and we were camping on the opposite bank, noticing things in general. By-and-by a small boat came in sight, towed through the water at a tremendous pace by a powerful barge horse, on which sat a very small boy. Scattered about the boat, in dreamy and reposeful attitudes, lay five fellows, {{the man who was}} steering having a particularly restful appearance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here you see," [...] he said, [...] "is the Villette gate. Just {{outside it}} a narrow street {{on the right}} leads down in the {{direction}} of the canal. It is just at the bottom of that narrow street at its junction with the <b>tow-path</b> there that I want you two and the cart to be. It had better be a coal-car by the way; they will be unloading coal close by there to-morrow," [...] he added with one of his sudden irrepressible outbursts of merriment. [...] "You and Tony can exercise your muscles coal-heaving, and incidentally make yourselves known in the neighbourhood as good if somewhat grimy patriots." ...|$|E
60|$|No, {{on second}} thoughts, I will not repeat what Harris said. I {{may have been}} to blame, I admit it; but nothing excuses {{violence}} of language and coarseness of expression, especially in {{a man who has}} been carefully brought up, as I know Harris has been. I was thinking of other things, and forgot, as any one might easily understand, that I was steering, and the consequence was that we had got mixed up a good deal with the <b>tow-path.</b> It was difficult to say, for the moment, which was us and which was the Middlesex bank of the river; but we found out after a while, and separated ourselves.|$|E
60|$|We {{had to take}} to {{the canal}} {{in the course of the}} afternoon; because, where it crossed the river, there was, not a bridge, but a siphon. If it had not been for an excited fellow on the bank, we should have paddled right into the siphon, and thenceforward not paddled any more. We met a man, a gentleman, on the <b>tow-path,</b> who was much {{interested}} in our cruise. And I was witness to a strange seizure of lying suffered by the Cigarette: who, because his knife came from Norway, narrated all sorts of adventures in that country, where he has never been. He was quite feverish at the end, and pleaded demoniacal possession.|$|E
6000|$|... "Atlantic!" [...] {{interrupted}} the captain contemptuously, [...] "I should have but a poor opinion of myself, had I seen {{nothing but the}} Atlantic! Indeed, I never can believe I am at sea at all, on the Atlantic, the passages between New-York and Portsmouth being little more than so much canalling along a <b>tow-path.</b> If you wish to say any thing about oceans, talk of the Pacific, or of the Great South Sea, where a man may run a month with a fair wind, and hardly go from island to island. Indeed, that is an ocean {{in which there is}} a manufactory of islands, for they turn them off in lots to supply the market, and of a size to suit customers." ...|$|E
60|$|They arrived safely {{at their}} journey's end, without {{any sort of}} accident. They had made the whole forty miles {{in less than two}} days, and were all as well as when they started, without having {{suffered}} for a moment from seasickness. The boat drew up at the <b>tow-path</b> just before the stable belonging to the house which the father had already taken, and the whole family at once began helping the crew put the things ashore. The boys thought {{it would have been a}} splendid stable to keep the pony in, only they had sold the pony; but they saw in an instant that it would do for a circus as soon as they could get acquainted with enough boys to have one.|$|E
60|$|The Sambre turned so industriously {{to and fro}} {{among his}} little hills, that it was past six before we drew near the lock at Quartes. There were some {{children}} on the <b>tow-path,</b> with whom the Cigarette fell into a chaffing talk as they ran along beside us. It was in vain that I warned him. In vain I told him, in English, that boys were the most dangerous creatures; and if once you began with them, {{it was safe to}} end in a shower of stones. For my own part, whenever anything was addressed to me, I smiled gently and shook my head as though I were an inoffensive person inadequately acquainted with French. For indeed I have had such experience at home, that I would sooner meet many wild animals than a troop of healthy urchins.|$|E
6000|$|We met {{many big}} keel-boats {{on their way}} up, using sails, mule power, and profanity--a tedious and {{laborious}} business. A wire rope led from the foretopmast to the file of mules on the <b>tow-path</b> a hundred yards ahead, and by dint of much banging and swearing and urging, the detachment of drivers {{managed to get a}} speed of two or three miles an hour out of the mules against the stiff current. The Neckar has always been used as a canal, and thus has given employment to a great many men and animals; but now that this steamboat is able, with a small crew and a bushel or so of coal, to take nine keel-boats farther up the river in one hour than thirty men and thirty mules can do it in two, it is believed that the old-fashioned towing industry is on its death-bed. A second steamboat began work in the Neckar three months after the first one was put in service. [Figure 4] ...|$|E
6000|$|Next morning, when we {{set forth}} on the Willebroek Canal, the rain began heavy and chill. The water of the canal stood at about the {{drinking}} temperature of tea; and under this cold aspersion the surface was covered with steam. The exhilaration of departure, and the easy motion of the boats under each stroke of the paddles, supported us through this misfortune while it lasted; and when the cloud passed and the sun came out again, our spirits went up above the range of stay-at-home humours. A good breeze rustled and shivered in the rows of trees that bordered the canal. The leaves flickered {{in and out of}} the light in tumultuous masses. It seemed sailing weather to eye and ear; but down between the banks, the wind reached us only in faint and desultory puffs. There was hardly enough to steer by. Progress was intermittent and unsatisfactory. A jocular person, of marine antecedents, hailed us from the <b>tow-path</b> with a [...] "C'est vite, mais c'est long." ...|$|E
6000|$|Scrymgeour {{thought it}} over. [...] "She is {{grateful}} to me," [...] he concluded, [...] "for drawing away suspicion {{from the other}} man, but what can have made the father so amiable? Suppose she has not told him that I am an impostor, he should still look upon me as a villain; and if she has told him, he should be still more furious. It is curious, but no affair of mine." [...] Three times {{within the next few}} days he encountered the lady on the <b>tow-path</b> or elsewhere with a young gentleman of empty countenance, who, he saw must be the real Lothario. Once they passed him {{when he was in the}} shadow of a tree, and the lady was making pretty faces with a cigarette in her mouth. The house-boat Heathen Chinee lay but a short distance off, and Scrymgeour could see the owner gazing after his daughter placidly, a pipe between his lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think I {{ever heard}} my uncle laugh, but I can {{remember}} how {{he smiled at}} my aunt's laughing, as {{he put his hand}} on her shoulder; I thought it was somehow a very sad smile. On Wednesday I was allowed to go with my aunt and cousin to see him off on the packet, which came up from Cincinnati early in the morning; I had lain awake most of the night, and then nearly overslept myself, and then was at the canal in time. We made a gay parting for him, but when the boat started, and I was gloating on the three horses making up the <b>tow-path</b> at a spanking trot, under the snaky spirals of the driver's smacking whip-lash, I caught sight of my uncle standing on the deck and smiling that sad smile of his. My aunt was waving her handkerchief, but when she turned away she put it to her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was most}} unfortunate for all {{concerned}} that the boy did not sleep on board. There was, however, no room for him; so he came at seven in the morning, and retired when his labors were over for the day. I say he came; but {{in point of fact}} that was the difficulty with the boy. He couldn't come. He came as far as he could: that is to say, he walked up the <b>tow-path</b> until he was opposite the house-boat, and then he hallooed to be taken on board, whereupon some one had to go in the dingy for him. All the time we were in the house-boat that boy was never five minutes late. Wet or fine, calm or rough, 7 A.M. found the boy on the <b>tow-path</b> hallooing. No sooner were we asleep than the dewy morn was made hideous by the boy. Lying in bed with the blankets over our heads to deaden his cries, his fresh, lusty young voice pierced wood-work, blankets, sheets, everything. [...] "Ya-ho, ahoy, ya-ho, aho, ahoy!" [...] So he kept it up. What followed may easily be guessed. We all lay as silent as the grave, each waiting for some one else to rise and bring the impatient lad across. At last the stillness would be broken by some one's yelling out that he would do for that boy. A second would mutter horribly in his sleep; a third would make himself a favorite for the moment by shouting through the wooden partition that it was the fifth's turn this morning. The fifth would tell us where he would see the boy before he went across for him. Then there would be silence again. Eventually some one would put an ulster over his night-shirt, and sternly announce his intention of going over and taking the boy's life. Hearing this, the others at once dropped off to sleep. For a few days we managed to trick the boy by pulling up our blinds and so conveying to his mind the impression that we were getting up. Then he had not our breakfast ready when we did get up, which naturally enraged us.|$|E
6000|$|It didn't {{matter what}} we did, the boy {{put a stop to}} it. We tried whist, and in ten minutes there was a [...] "Hoy, hie, ya-ho!" [...] from the {{opposite}} shore. It was the boy come back with the vegetables. If we were reading, [...] "Ya-ho, hie!" [...] and some one had to cross for that boy and the water-can. The boy was on the <b>tow-path</b> just when we had fallen into a snooze; he had to be taken across for the milk immediately we had lighted our pipes. On the whole, it is an open question whether it was not even more annoying to take him over than to go for him. Two or three times we tried to be sociable and went into the village together; but no sooner had we begun to enjoy ourselves than we remembered that we must go back and let the boy ashore. Tennyson speaks of a company making believe to be merry while all the time the spirit of a departed one haunted them in their play. That was exactly the effect of the boy on us.|$|E
60|$|By {{a little}} before noon we were running down the coast of our destination, Fakarava: the air very light, the sea near smooth; though still we were {{accompanied}} by a continuous murmur from the beach, {{like the sound of}} a distant train. The isle is of a huge longitude, the enclosed lagoon thirty miles by ten or twelve, and the coral <b>tow-path,</b> which they call the land, some eighty or ninety miles by (possibly) one furlong. That part by which we sailed was all raised; the underwood excellently green, the topping wood of coco-palms continuous--a mark, if I had known it, of man's intervention. For once more, and once more unconsciously, we were within hail of fellow-creatures, and that vacant beach was but a pistol-shot from the capital city of the archipelago. But the life of an atoll, unless it be enclosed, passes wholly on the shores of the lagoon; it is there the villages are seated, there the canoes ply and are drawn up; and the beach of the ocean is a place accursed and deserted, the fit scene only for wizardry and shipwreck, and in the native belief a haunting ground of murderous spectres.|$|E
6000|$|In 1856, Garfield {{took his}} degree at Williams College, and had now {{finished}} his formal education. By that time, {{he was a}} fair though not a great scholar, competently read in the Greek and Latin literatures, and with a good knowledge of French and German. He was now nearly twenty-five years old; and his experience was large and varied {{enough to make him}} already into a man of the world. He had been farmer, carpenter, canal driver, and student; he had seen the primitive life of the forest, and the more civilized society of the Atlantic shore; he had taught in schools in many states; he had supported himself for years by his own labours; and now, at an age when many young men are, as a rule, only just beginning life on their own account, he had practically raised himself from his own class into the class of educated and cultivated gentlemen. As soon as he had taken his degree, his old friends, the trustees of the [...] "Eclectic Institute" [...] at Hiram, proud of their former sweeper and bell-ringer, called him back at a good salary as teacher of Greek and Latin. It was then just ten years since he had toiled wearily along the <b>tow-path</b> of the Ohio and Pennsylvania Canal.|$|E
6000|$|He {{had been}} so happy in the thought of [...] "getting home by Christmas," [...] and so charmingly {{communicative}} as {{to the members of}} his family for whom such and such gifts were intended, that the Englishman cut short the record of fraud and soothed him by saying that he had not been so very badly [...] "done," [...] after all. This consideration was misplaced, for, his peace of mind restored, the Young Man from Manchester looked out of the window and, waving his hand over the Empire generally, said: [...] "I say. Look here. All those wells are wrong, you know!" [...] The wells were on the wheel and inclined plane system; but he objected to the incline, and said that it would be much better for the bullocks if they walked on level ground. Then light dawned upon him, and he said: [...] "I suppose it's to exercise all their muscles. Y' know a canal horse is no use after he has been on the <b>tow-path</b> for some time. He can't walk anywhere but on the flat, y' know, and I suppose it's just the same with bullocks." [...] The spurs of the Aravalis, under which the train was running, had evidently suggested this brilliant idea which passed uncontradicted, for the Englishman was looking out of the window.|$|E
60|$|But now {{at length}} we heard this staid and {{primitive}} river rushing to her fall, like any rill. We here left its channel, {{just above the}} Billerica Falls, and entered the canal, which runs, or rather is conducted, six miles through the woods to the Merrimack, at Middlesex, and as we did not care to loiter {{in this part of}} our voyage, while one ran along the <b>tow-path</b> drawing the boat by a cord, the other kept it off the shore with a pole, so that we accomplished the whole distance in little more than an hour. This canal, which is the oldest in the country, and has even an antique look beside the more modern railroads, is fed by the Concord, so that we were still floating on its familiar waters. It is so much water which the river lets for the advantage of commerce. There appeared some want of harmony in its scenery, since it was not of equal date with the woods and meadows through which it is led, and we missed the conciliatory influence of time on land and water; but in the lapse of ages, Nature will recover and indemnify herself, and gradually plant fit shrubs and flowers along its borders. Already the kingfisher sat upon a pine over the water, and the bream and pickerel swam below. Thus all works pass directly {{out of the hands of}} the architect into the hands of Nature, to be perfected.|$|E
