The state is strongly associated {{with the image of}} <b>the</b> <b>cowboy</b> shown in westerns and in country western music. The state's numerous oil tycoons are also a popular pop culture topic as seen in the hit TV series Dallas.|$|E

50|$|The 2006 {{season was}} one which saw <b>the</b> <b>Cowboys</b> picked to finish {{last in the}} conference. After an opening day victory over Utah State, <b>the</b> <b>Cowboys</b> {{suffered}} four heartbreaking losses, {{two of them in}} overtime. Then <b>the</b> <b>Cowboys</b> fortunes began to shift. The team enjoyed a four-game winning streak, all against conference opponents. <b>The</b> <b>Cowboys</b> next two games were both embarrassing road losses, the first against TCU, in which they managed only a field goal. The next game was on the road against than #25 BYU. The Cougars trounced <b>the</b> <b>Cowboys,</b> 55-7. <b>The</b> <b>Cowboys</b> fell to 5-6. <b>The</b> <b>Cowboys</b> won their final game against UNLV, moving them to a 6-6 record, and making them bowl eligible but the team did not receive an invitation.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cowboys</b> scored 299 {{points and}} allowed 221 points. For the fifth {{consecutive}} season, <b>the</b> <b>Cowboys</b> finished first in their division.

5|$|Many of {{the rural}} ranchers and Cowboys resented the growing {{influence}} of the city residents over county politics and law enforcement. The ranchers largely maintained {{control of the country}} outside Tombstone, {{due in large part to}} the sympathetic support of Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, who favored the Cowboys and rural ranchers, and who also grew to intensely dislike the Earps. Behan tended to ignore the Earps' complaints about the McLaurys' and Clantons' horse thieving and cattle rustling. The Earps were known to bend the law in their favor when it affected their gambling and saloon interests, which earned them further enmity with <b>the</b> <b>Cowboy</b> faction.|$|E
5|$|Red Dead Redemption spans two fictitious United States {{counties}} and a fictitious Mexican state: New Austin, West Elizabeth, and Nuevo Paraiso. New Austin and West Elizabeth are adjacent {{to each other}} and share a southern border with Mexico. Nuevo Paraiso is a Mexican state, separated from U.S. territory by the San Luis river. The game takes place primarily in the year 1911, featuring the final decade of the American Frontier and <b>the</b> <b>cowboy</b> and outlaw archetypes that shaped it. The landscape of the Wild West is beginning to fade and modern technologies like automobiles, machine guns, and oil drilling projects are beginning to appear.|$|E
5|$|At a diner called Winkie's, a man {{tells his}} {{companion}} about a nightmare {{in which he}} dreamt there was a horrible figure behind the diner. When they investigate, the figure appears, causing {{the man with the}} nightmare to collapse in fright. Elsewhere, director Adam Kesher has his film commandeered by mobsters, who insist he cast an unknown actress named Camilla Rhodes as the lead in his film. Adam resists, but after being thrown out of his house when he finds his wife cheating on him, he learns that his bank has closed his line of credit and he is broke.

50|$|Outgained and outrushed by <b>the</b> <b>Cowboys,</b> <b>the</b> Shockers were soundly {{beaten by}} <b>the</b> <b>Cowboys,</b> 49-12. <b>The</b> bowl was never played again {{due to the}} low attendance.|$|R
5|$|Back at Paramount, Cooper {{returned}} to a more comfortable genre in Ernst Lubitsch's romantic comedy Bluebeard's Eighth Wife (1938) with Claudette Colbert. In the film, Cooper plays a wealthy American businessman in France {{who falls in love}} with an impoverished aristocrat's daughter and persuades her to become his eighth wife. Despite the clever screenplay by Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder, and solid performances by Cooper and Colbert, American audiences had trouble accepting Cooper in the role of a shallow philanderer. After all, it succeeded only in the European market. In the fall of 1938, Cooper appeared in H. C. Potter's romantic comedy <b>The</b> <b>Cowboy</b> and the Lady with Merle Oberon, about a sweet-natured rodeo cowboy who falls in love with the wealthy daughter of a presidential hopeful, believing her to be a poor, hard-working lady's maid. The efforts of three directors and several eminent screenwriters could not salvage {{what could have been a}} fine vehicle for Cooper. While more successful than its predecessor, the film was Cooper's fourth consecutive box-office failure in the American market.|$|E
5|$|On December 1, 1884, a town sheriff named Elfego Baca came {{face-to-face}} against 80 gunmen {{which became}} known as the Frisco shootout. The battle started when Baca arrested a cowboy who had shot him. In turn <b>the</b> <b>cowboy</b> called upon 80 of his associates to murder Baca. Baca took refuge in an adobe house, and {{over the course of a}} 36-hour siege, the gunmen put 400 bullet holes in the house (some accounts say a total of 4,000 shots) without touching Baca. He in turn killed 4 of them and wounded 8. When the shooting was over as the attackers finally ran out of ammo, Baca strolled out of the house unscathed. Baca went on to a distinguished career as a lawyer and legislator and died in his bed in 1945, age 80.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of the new state was quite small at first {{and there was a}} strong mix between the English-speaking American settlers that dominated in the eastern/northeastern portions {{of the state and the}} Spanish-speaking former Mexicans that dominated in the southern and western portions of the state. Statehood brought many new settlers. Because of the long Spanish presence in Mexico and various failed colonization efforts by the Spanish and Mexicans in northern Mexico, there were large herds of Longhorn cattle that roamed the state. Hardy by nature but also suitable for slaughtering and consumption, they represented an economic opportunity that many entrepreneurs seized upon, thus creating <b>the</b> <b>cowboy</b> culture for which Texas is famous. While in the early days of the republic cattle and bison were slaughtered for their hides, soon a beef industry was established with cattle being shipped all over the U.S. and the Caribbean (within a few decades, beef had become a staple of the American diet).|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Giants and <b>Cowboys</b> {{met again}} at MetLife Stadium in Week 14, 2016 in a Sunday Night Showdown. <b>The</b> <b>Cowboys</b> were riding 11-1 while the Giants were just {{coming off a}} tough loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. <b>The</b> <b>Cowboys</b> {{favorite}} to win, the Giants only allowed one touchdown to <b>the</b> Dallas <b>Cowboys</b> as <b>the</b> Giants won again 10-7 sweeping <b>the</b> <b>Cowboys</b> for <b>the</b> first time since 2011.|$|R

25|$|As the {{frontier}} ended, <b>the</b> <b>cowboy</b> life {{came to be}} highly romanticized. Exhibitions {{such as those of}} Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West Show helped to popularize the image of <b>the</b> <b>cowboy</b> as an idealized representative of the tradition of chivalry.|$|E
25|$|The {{bond between}} a cowboy and his horse is an {{important}} part of <b>the</b> <b>cowboy</b> mythology created by dime novels, pulp fiction stories, and Western cinema. Movies featuring Wonder Horses embellish this relationship between man and beast while heightening the exceptional and heroic qualities of <b>the</b> <b>cowboy</b> by his association with a remarkable animal.|$|E

25|$|By the 1880s, the {{expansion}} of the cattle industry resulted in a need for additional open range. Thus many ranchers expanded into the northwest, where there were still large tracts of unsettled grassland. Texas cattle were herded north, into the Rocky Mountain west and the Dakotas. <b>The</b> <b>cowboy</b> adapted much of his gear to the colder conditions, and westward movement of the industry also led to intermingling of regional traditions from California to Texas, often with <b>the</b> <b>cowboy</b> taking the most useful elements of each.|$|E

50|$|The Rams {{defense in}} the first half was able to control <b>the</b> <b>Cowboys</b> running game and was able to limit any big plays from Staubach. <b>The</b> <b>Cowboys</b> defense played well, but the Rams offense was able to make a few more plays then <b>the</b> <b>Cowboys</b> and that led to their nine-point lead going into the third quarter. But this was <b>the</b> <b>Cowboys</b> who were America's team. They had Roger Staubach and the Doomsday defense and were known for {{exciting}} games and great comebacks. As the second half got started it seemed as though everyone was waiting for that moment that <b>the</b> <b>Cowboys</b> would come alive and make their move.|$|R
