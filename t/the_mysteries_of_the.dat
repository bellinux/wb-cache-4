5|$|Meditation is an {{integral}} part of the rosary. This mode of meditation is the process of reflecting on <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rosary. With practice, this may in time turn into contemplation on the mysteries. The practice of meditation during the praying of repeated Hail Marys dates back to 15th century Carthusian monks, and was soon adopted by the Dominicans at large. By the 16th century the practice of meditation during the rosary had spread across Europe, and the book Meditationi del Rosario della Gloriosa Maria Virgine (i.e. Meditations on the Rosary of the Glorious Virgin Mary) printed in 1569 for the rosary confraternity of Milan provided an individual meditation to accompany each bead or prayer.|$|E
5|$|The team {{considered}} several ideas, {{including a}} return to a post-apocalyptic earth and the conquest of another planet in the Alpha Centauri system, before deciding to keep the new title on Planet. The premise allowed them to mix and match old and new characters and delve into <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monoliths and alien artifacts. The backstory evolved quickly, and the main conflict centered on the return of the original alien inhabitants. The idea of humans inadvertently caught up in an off-world civil war focused the story.|$|E
5|$|To further {{understand}} <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Foretellers and the future, the player, Chirithy, and Skuld re-enter the Foretellers' tower {{where they}} are caught by a Foreteller. They are also told that Ephemer is a traitor to his union {{and that he has}} disappeared. The player then challenges the Foreteller to a duel, assuming Ephemer has been captured, but is easily defeated. The Foreteller reveals that she is in fact Master Ava, and that the player's quest was a test of their character to see if they are worthy of leaving this world before the Great War between light and darkness. Keyblade wielders that can resist the darkness and fight for what they believe in, like their friends, are worthy of becoming elite Keyblade warriors known as Dandelions and going on to the Realm of Light and avoiding the coming universal war. All who stay will become a part of that war and must face an uncertain future. Skuld accepts the offer, but the player's character is uncertain if they should join Ephemer, who has gone on to the Realm of Light, or stay and fight to save the future. Later, they encounter two Keyblade warriors accusing each other of stealing Lux from their unions, and the player is forced to fight Master Aced, who defeats them. Ira arrives to stop the fighting. Aced claims that he is collecting more Keyblade warriors to prepare for the upcoming war before leaving. Ira informs the player, Skuld, and Chirithy that the war cannot be avoided and {{that there will be no}} victor. The only Foreteller who may have a solution is Gula so the trio go to look for him.|$|E

25|$|Elements of the Zohar {{crept into}} the liturgy of the 16th and 17th centuries, and the {{religious}} poets not only used the allegorism and symbolism of the Zohar in their compositions, but even adopted its style, e.g. the use of erotic terminology to illustrate the relations between man and God. Thus, {{in the language of}} some Jewish poets, the beloved one's curls indicate <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Deity; sensuous pleasures, and especially intoxication, typify the highest degree of divine love as ecstatic contemplation; while the wine-room represents merely the state through which the human qualities merge or are exalted into those of God.|$|E

25|$|In Eastern Orthodox theology, {{essence of}} God being {{that which is}} beyond human {{comprehension}} {{and can not be}} defined and or approached by human understanding. Roman Catholic teachings are somewhat similar in considering <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Trinity as being beyond human reason. However, differences exist in that in Roman Catholic theology and teaching, God the Father is the eternal source of the Son (begot the Son by an eternal generation) and of the Holy Spirit (by an eternal procession from the Father and the Son) and the one who breathes the Holy Spirit with and through the Son, but the Eastern Orthodox consider the Spirit to proceed from the Father alone.|$|E
25|$|The Capilla del Rosario or Rosary Chapel was {{constructed}} in 1763 and its vault is divided into four triangular segments. The north segment contains a naval battle where galleons, with Spanish and Ottoman coats of arms, fire at each other, referring to the Battle of Lepanto. The Virgin of the Rosary is credited with the Spanish victory. On the south side, there is a ceremony dedicated to the Virgin Mary in Rome, presided over by Pope Pius V. The main altar is gilded and contains {{the image of the}} Virgin. There are 15 small sections over mirrors with scenes related to <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rosary. On the east and west walls there are images of saints grouped by monastic order. In the interior of the chamber, there are portraits of Father Neri, Esteban Valerio de Alfaro and María Velázquez de Casillta (his parents). By the windows are portraits of Doctor Díaz de Gamarra and Dominican friar Francisco Alonso de Rivera and a self portrait of Pocasangre, who emphasizes his indigenous features. The roof of this inner chamber {{is in the form of}} a large shell. Writings such as the Ave Maria, prayers, saints' names and more are inscribed on the ribs of the shell.|$|E

25|$|The Church of Santo Domingo {{is located}} on 5 de Mayo Street. The main portal is of pure classic style {{finished}} in gray cantera stone. It consists of three levels with paired Doric-like columns. The façade of the old monastery is highly decorated in Baroque style, in front {{of which is a}} large atrium. Inside the ceiling consists of two large vaults and contains gilded altarpieces in Baroque, Salmonic and Churrigueresque styles. The Chapel of the Rosario is located in the Church of Santo Domingo. The Chapel was built between 1650 and 1690 and was the first to be dedicated to the Our Lady of the Rosary. The chapel is filled with symbolism, as it is filled with images and elements which are representative of the Baroque of New Spain. This symbolism is principally meant to aid with the evangelization process. The chapel contains three themes important to the Church, <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rosary, the virtues associated with it and the Virgin of the Rosary herself. The cupola is {{in the shape of the}} crown of the Virgin Mary. The chapel is decorated with sculpted plaster that has been gilded done by local artists. There are also six paintings done by José Rodriguez Carnero as well as paintings by the altar depicting the life of the Virgin.|$|E
25|$|In 1587, {{during a}} spiritual conference in Bohemia, Kelley {{informed}} Dee that the angel Uriel {{had ordered the}} men to share all their possessions, including their wives. By this time, Kelley had gained some renown as an alchemist and in fact was more sought-after than Dee in this regard: this was a line of work that had prospects for serious and long-term financial gain, especially among the royal families of central Europe. Dee, on the other hand, {{was more interested in}} communicating with the angels who he believed would help him solve <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heavens through mathematics, optics, astrology, science and navigation. It may be that Kelley in fact wished to end Dee's dependence on him as a scryer for their increasingly lengthy and frequent spiritual conferences. The order for wife-sharing caused Dee great anguish, but he apparently did not doubt its genuineness. They apparently did share wives. However, Dee broke off the conferences immediately afterwards. Dee returned to England in 1589: Kelley went on to be the alchemist for Emperor Rudolf II. Nine months later, on Feb. 28, 1588, a son was born to Dee's wife, whom Dee baptized Theodorus Trebonianus Dee and raised as his own. It is possible that this child was Kelley's; Dee was 60 at the time, Edward Kelley was 32.|$|E
