500|$|Despite Pinkertons initial failure, during Weezer's hiatus {{the album}} amassed a cult following. By {{the time of}} the release of the Green Album in 2001, a wave of {{mainstream}} emo bands including Jimmy Eat World, Saves the Day, Dashboard Confessional and Motion City Soundtrack had cited it as a major influence. Cuomo was not comforted by this development, and told Rolling Stone in 2001: [...] "The most painful <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> these days is the cult around Pinkerton. It's just a sick album, sick in a diseased sort of way. It's such a source of anxiety because all the fans we have right now have stuck around because of that album. But, honestly, I never want to play those songs again; I never want to hear them again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jackman {{was asked}} to {{consider}} taking on the role as James Bond before Daniel Craig was chosen to play the character, but turned it down due to other commitments. Speaking to the British Press Association in 2011, Jackman said: 'I was about to shoot X-Men 2 and Wolverine had become this <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> and I didn’t want to be doing two such iconic characters at once.' ...|$|E

5000|$|The film makes a {{few changes}} to Kaufman's life story. As Kaufman {{explains}} in the prologue, [...] "All {{the most important}} <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> are changed around and mixed up for dramatic purposes." ...|$|R
2500|$|On {{the role}} of writing in her life, she says: [...] "I think of writing simply in terms of pleasure. It's the most {{important}} <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> making things. Much as I love my husband and my children, I love them only because I am the person who makes these things. I, who I am, is the person that has the project of making a thing. Well, that's putting it pompously – but constructing. I do see it in sort of three-dimensional structures. And because that person does that all the time, that person is able to love all these people." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Kramer, every drama he {{has written}} derives from a desire to {{understand}} love's nature and its obstacles. Kramer became involved with movie production at age 23 by taking {{a job as a}} Teletype operator at Columbia Pictures, agreeing to the position only because the machine was across the hall from the president's office. Eventually, he won a position in the story department reworking scripts. His first writing credit was as a dialogue writer for Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush, a teen sex comedy. He followed that with the 1969 Oscar-nominated screenplay Women in Love, an adaptation of D. H. Lawrence's novel. He next penned what Kramer calls [...] "the only <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> I'm ashamed of," [...] the 1973 musical remake of Frank Capra's Lost Horizon, a notorious critical and commercial failure whose screenplay was based very closely on Capra's film. [...] Kramer has said that his well-negotiated fee for this work, skillfully invested by his brother, made him financially self-sufficient.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, Pattinson became romantically {{linked to}} co-star Kristen Stewart. For a long time, the two did not {{explicitly}} confirm a relationship, but paparazzi photographs and eyewitness accounts drove intense media and fan speculation and attention. However, Stewart officially acknowledged {{her relationship with}} Pattinson {{for the first time}} in July, 2012, when Us Weekly published photos of Stewart showing affection with her Snow White and the Huntsman director, Rupert Sanders, with what the Huffington Post called an [...] "affair." [...] The day that the photos were released, Stewart issued a public apology to Pattinson at People Magazine, saying, [...] "I'm deeply sorry for the hurt and embarrassment I've caused to those close to me and everyone this has affected. This momentary indiscretion has jeopardized the most important <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> the person I love and respect the most, Rob. I love him, I love him, I'm so sorry." [...] After dodging the question repeatedly, Pattinson confirmed in an interview with Esquire UK in July 2014 that he and Stewart had split in 2012. There had been prior speculation that the couple broke up in May 2013, when Pattinson was seen removing personal items from Stewart's home.|$|E

5000|$|Regarding the album's lyrical content, Mondanile noted: [...] "I {{was more}} {{interested}} in writing about actual <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> I wanted to be more specific with the songs, and write about something.

2500|$|Bright {{became friends}} with Tim DuBois, head of Arista Records in Nashville, who {{was not only a}} label {{executive}} but a creative-type person whom Bright naturally related to as a fellow [...] "song junkie". The two enjoyed playing songs for each other and analyzing them critically, leading DuBois to recognize Bright's keen insight into what makes a commercially good song. DuBois had under contract three musicians whom he suggested work together rather than go for separate careers. The new trio was named [...] "BlackHawk" [...] and consisted of Henry Paul, Dave Robbins, and Van Stephenson. They had recorded several songs, but DuBois was not happy with their sound and he asked Bright to spend time with them {{to come up with something}} with more commercial appeal. Bright collaborated with the band on intensive rehearsal sessions in a basement studio over several months, coming up with a bluegrass-type sound but with rock guitars, blending a mandolin and close vocal harmonies. Bright thought the sound was a [...] "game changer". DuBois agreed and was willing to give Bright his first job as producer. Bright's production of BlackHawk's first single, [...] "Goodbye Says It All" [...] was released in 1993 and reached number 11 on the Billboard Country charts. Their next four songs were even more successful, all reaching the top ten. BlackHawk eventually sold over four million albums. Over a 12 year span Bright had ascended from the tape room to Vice President of EMI Publishing. With this extraordinary success, Bright said, [...] "I thought I was king of the world". His success did not last. The next four acts he produced were failures and he was subsequently terminated by EMI. Bright stated [...] "God kicked me back down the ladder[...] [...] it was the worst <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> at that time." [...] Later, EMI's then competitor, Sony/ATV approached Bright with a joint venture giving him his own publishing company, a production deal, and seed money for a management deal. He accepted, and with associate Marty Williams, co-founded the publishing company Teracel Music.|$|E
