5|$|Around Wschodnia street, workers {{opened fire}} on a company of {{soldiers}} and cavalry, and on Południowa street, a unit of gendarmes was surrounded. Several fires begun in the town, as workers set liquor stores on fire, and the government forces assaulted the first barricades, initially without much success. The tsarist representatives called from reinforcements, which came from Częstochowa, Warsaw, and summer training camps. Several infantry regiments entered the city. Eventually, Russian forces sent to suppress the workers numbered six infantry regiments and several cavalry regiments. Despite that, the situation was spiralling into a full blown uprising.

5|$|In 1876, when {{a scandal}} forced the {{original}} Republican nominee, Godlove Stein Orth, {{to drop out}} of the gubernatorial race, Harrison accepted the Republican Party's invitation to take his place on the ticket. Harrison centered his campaign on economic policy and favored deflating the national currency. He was ultimately defeated in a plurality by James D. Williams, losing by 5,084 votes out of a total 434,457 cast, but Harrison was able to build on his new prominence in state politics. When the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 reached Indianapolis, he gathered a citizen militia to make a show of support for owners and management, and helped to mediate an agreement between <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> management and to prevent the strike from widening.|$|E

In the North Tower, 1,355 people at or above the point of impact were trapped and died of smoke inhalation, fell or jumped from the tower to escape the smoke and flames, or were killed in the building's eventual collapse. The destruction of all three staircases in the tower when Flight 11 hit made it impossible for anyone above the impact zone to escape. 107 people below the point of impact died as well.|$|E

5|$|After the Armistice in November 1918, Strachwitz was repatriated and {{returned}} to a Germany in civil turmoil. He travelled to Berlin via Konstanz, at the Swiss–German border, and Munich. On his journey he saw many former German soldiers whose military discipline had broken down. Unable to tolerate this situation and fearing a Communist revolution, he travelled on to Berlin, arriving at the Berlin Anhalter Bahnhof where he was met by a friend. Strachwitz had called ahead asking his friend to bring him his Gardes du Corps uniform, which he put on immediately. Berlin {{was in a state}} of revolution. The newly established provisional government under the leadership of Chancellor Friedrich Ebert was threatened by the Spartacist uprising of the German Revolution, whose ambition was a Soviet-style proletarian dictatorship. Ebert ordered the former soldiers, organized in Freikorps (paramilitary organizations) among them Strachwitz, to attack <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> put down the uprising.|$|E

5|$|Thanks {{to popular}} support within Poland, {{as well as}} to {{international}} support and media coverage, the Gdańsk workers held out until the government gave in to their demands. On August 21 a Governmental Commission (Komisja Rządowa) including Mieczysław Jagielski arrived in Gdańsk, and another one with Kazimierz Barcikowski was dispatched to Szczecin. On August 30 and 31, and on September 3, representatives of <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> the government signed an agreement ratifying many of the workers' demands, including the right to strike. This agreement {{came to be known as}} the August or Gdańsk agreement (Porozumienia sierpniowe). Other agreements were signed in Szczecin (the Szczecin Agreement of August 30), and Jastrzębie-Zdrój on September 3. It was called the Jastrzębie Agreement (Porozumienia jastrzebskie) and as such is regarded as part of the Gdańsk agreement. Though concerned with labor-union matters, the agreement enabled citizens to introduce democratic changes within the communist political structure and was regarded as a first step toward dismantling the Party's monopoly of power. The workers' main concerns were the establishment of a labor union independent of communist-party control, and recognition of a legal right to strike. Workers' needs would now receive clear representation. Another consequence of the Gdańsk Agreement was the replacement, in September 1980, of Edward Gierek by Stanisław Kania as Party First Secretary.|$|E
5|$|The NAACP later {{blamed the}} PTC {{management}} for intentionally dragging its {{feet on the}} contract that the TWU approved in late June. The NAACP claimed that the PTC management had hoped to undermine the TWU's position with <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> to possibly oust TWU {{in favor of the}} more pliable PRTEU. The PTC was aware that the SmithConnally Act forbade strikes harming war production and that if, with a contract impasse, TWU itself had initiated a contract strike, the union might have been tossed out. This analysis of the situation was shared later by several historians, particularly by James Wolfinger. Another historian, Alan M. Winkler, also had a largely negative view of the company's role in the conflict and concluded that PTC management, while not overtly conspiring with the strikers, reacted feebly to the strike and tried to opportunistically exploit the situation and the racist attitudes of many white workers for their own purposes.|$|E
5|$|The {{heads of}} <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> queens are {{as long as}} broad with convexed sides. The mandibles are long with {{thirteen}} known teeth. The first and third segments of the funiculus are equally long. The thorax is longer than broad by two to three-fourths its width, and the mesonotum is longer than it is broad in workers; the mesonotum is broader than it is long in queens. The node (a segment between the mesosoma and gaster) is {{as long as it}} is broad, and the postpetiole is one-sixth broader than long. The first segment of the gaster is broader than its length. M.regularis shares a similar appearance to M.forficata, but there are several morphological differences that separate the two. Owing to the rugose sculpture of the head and thorax, M.regularis is noticeably smaller than M.forficata. The mandibles of M.regularis are much narrower, the posterior corners of the head are more round and the petiolar peduncle is longer. The mandibles appear to be deep red, and some areas, such as the gastric segments, are golden brown.|$|E
50|$|Central to the Marxist {{critique}} of political {{economy is the}} obscurantism of the juridical labour contract, between <b>the</b> <b>worker</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> capitalist, that masks the true, exploitive nature of their economic relationship—that <b>the</b> <b>worker</b> does not sell his and her labour, but that <b>the</b> <b>worker</b> sells individual labour power, the human capacity to perform work and manufacture commodities (goods and services) that yield a profit to the producer.

5|$|The ice trade {{started with}} the {{harvesting}} of ice from ponds and rivers during the winter, to be stored for the summer months ahead. Water freezes in this way once it falls to a temperature of 40°F (5°C)and the surrounding air temperature drops to 32°F (0°C). Ice needed {{to be at least}} 18inches (0.46 m) thick to be harvested, as it needed to support the weight of <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> horses and be suitable for cutting into large blocks. In New England, ponds and rivers typically had deep enough ice to harvest between January and March, while in Norway harvesting occurred between December and February. Natural ice could occur with different qualities; most prized was hard, clear crystal ice, typically consumed at the table; more porous, white coloured ice was less valuable and used by industry. With a good thickness of ice, around 1,000 tons (900,000kg) could be harvested from an acre (0.4 hectares) of surface water.|$|E
5|$|Together with a {{simultaneous}} {{attack on the}} Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and a failed plane hijacking {{that resulted in a}} plane crash in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, the attacks resulted in the deaths of 2,996 people (2,507 civilians, 343 firefighters, 72 law enforcement officers, 55 military personnel, and the 19 hijackers). More than 90% of <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> visitors who died in the towers had been at or above the points of impact. In the North Tower, 1,355 people at or above the point of impact were trapped, and died of smoke inhalation, fell, jumped from the tower to escape the smoke and flames, or were killed when the building eventually collapsed. One stairwell in the South Tower, Stairwell A, somehow avoided complete destruction, unlike the rest of the building. When Flight 11 hit, all three staircases in the North Tower above the impact zone were destroyed, thus making it impossible for anyone above the impact zone to escape. 107 people below the point of impact also died.|$|E
5|$|Several {{synonyms}} {{have either}} been {{classified as a}} separate species from the meat ant or even a subspecies. Iridomyrmex purpureus sanguineus and I. p. viridiaeneus were classified as subspecies in 1974, previously being recognised as two species. I. detectus castrae was originally described as {{a variant of the}} meat ant in 1925 (as I. d. var. castrae), but the taxon was reclassified as a subspecies in 1985; subsequently, a 1993 revision reclassified I. p. sanguineus and I. p. viridiaeneus at species level while I. d. castrae was synonymised, based on morphological examinations of collected material. Camponotus horni, Formica smithii and Liometopum aeneum were described as three distinct species in three different ant genera, but these classifications were short-lived, as scientists discovered that these taxa were all identical, and subsequently synonymised them with the meat ant. Camponotus horni was described by English entomologist William Forsell Kirby in 1896 from worker and queen syntypes he collected at Palm Creek in the Northern Territory. In 1930, Australian entomologist John S. Clark reviewed these specimens and synonymised the taxon with the meat ant. However, the queen was later found to be distinct from <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> C. horni was redescribed as a species. The information provided by Clark makes it sufficient to retain the validity of the name, making Clark the new author of C. horni. Due to the uncertain taxonomic status of Clark's C. horni, a proposal to rename the species cannot be carried through. Clark's C. horni is currently a junior homonym for Kirby's C. horni.|$|E
