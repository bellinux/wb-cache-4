5|$|A second form of neuroacanthocytosis, Levine-Critchley syndrome, was {{discovered}} by the American internist Irvine M. Levine in 1960 and reported in Neurology in 1964, and again in 1968. Subsequently, similar symptoms were identified and described by the British neurologist MacDonald Critchley in 1968. In both cases, <b>the</b> <b>physicians</b> described a hereditary syndrome that combined acanthocytosis with neurological peculiarities but normal serum lipoprotein. Specific symptoms included tics, grimacing, movement disorders, difficulty swallowing, poor coordination, hyporeflexia, chorea, and seizures. Patients often mutilated their tongues, lips, and cheeks. The diseases appeared in both sexes, and were usually diagnosed in infancy.|$|E

5|$|Marrakesh {{has long}} been an {{important}} centre for healthcare in Morocco, and the regional rural and urban populations alike are reliant upon hospitals in the city. The psychiatric hospital installed by the Merinid Caliph Ya'qub al-Mansur in the 16th century was described by the historian 'Abd al-Wahfd al- Marrakushi {{as one of the greatest}} in the world at the time.

5|$|At {{the same}} time, recent studies show an {{increasingly}} positive attitude {{of patients and}} physicians (M.D. and D.O.) towards the use of manual therapy as a valid, safe and effective treatment modality. One survey, published in the Journal of Continuing Medical Education, found {{that a majority of}} physicians (81%) and patients (76%) felt that manual manipulation (MM) was safe, and over half (56% of physicians and 59% of patients) felt that manipulation should be available in the primary care setting. Although less than half (40%) of <b>the</b> <b>physicians</b> reported any educational exposure to MM and less than one-quarter (20%) have administered MM in their practice, most (71%) respondents endorsed desiring more instruction in MM. Another small study examined the interest and ability of M.D. residents in learning osteopathic principles and skills, including OMT. It showed that after a 1-month elective rotation, the M.D. residents responded favorably to the experience.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>physician</b> who treats a suicidal patient faces real life-or-death {{decision}}s. The primary decision {{depends on}} his professional {{evaluation of the}} likelihood that his patient will take his own life. If <b>the</b> <b>physician</b> concludes that suicide is imminent, medical ethics and the law require he take steps to protect his patient. Failing to take appropriate protective action exposes <b>the</b> <b>physician</b> to legal liability. <b>The</b> <b>physician</b> owes a duty to his patient, but defining parameters of this duty and methods to satisfy it are not clear. Neither the legal system nor current medical knowledge or practice establishes guidelines to aid the doctor. This article briefly reviews current medical knowledge concerning suicide. It suggests that <b>the</b> <b>physician</b> must determine, aided by a proposed, defined list of risk factors, whether his patient is suicidal. If the patient is suicidal, <b>the</b> <b>physician</b> must expand his evaluation to determine if an underlying mental disease exists. If he discovers a disease, <b>the</b> <b>physician</b> must decide whether suicidal thoughts and impulses {{are the product of}} this underlying disorder. Where suicidal thoughts and impulses are the product of an underlying mental disease, <b>the</b> <b>physician</b> can—in fact, should—take reasonable steps to prevent the suicide. This article proposes a set of procedures all physicians should follow whenever suicide predictors are present and <b>the</b> <b>physician</b> decides <b>the</b> patient 2 ̆ 7 s suicidal thoughts and impulses are the product of an underlying mental illness. A different analysis is suggested if the patient 2 ̆ 7 s suicidal thoughts and impulses are a product of something other than an underlying mental disease. The article concludes that an adult whose suicidal impulses do not stem from an underlying, high-risk mental disease has a right to kill himself. So long as <b>the</b> <b>physician</b> correctly concluded these thoughts and impulses are not the result of mental disorder, explained this to the patient, thoroughly explored with him reasons for and consequences of his proposed actions, and recorded these, <b>the</b> <b>physician</b> has satisfied his legal responsibility and no basis for liability exists...|$|R

5|$|Greys Anatomy {{follows the}} lives of {{surgical}} interns and residents at the fictional Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital (formerly Seattle Grace Hospital, Season 1–6, Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, Season 6–9, and then Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital, Season 9–present), as they gradually evolve into seasoned doctors, {{with the help of}} their competent mentors. Every installment, typically, commences with a voice-over narrative from Meredith Grey or a season regular, foreshadowing the theme of the episode. Each season tends to represent the physicians' academic year, with each completed year qualifying the residents at a level higher in the surgical field. The season will always end with a finale, typically involving a tragic event such as a death or character departure. Most installments revolve around the doctors' everyday lives as surgeons, but the show puts an emphasis on their personal, rather than professional, lives. The series sets aside medical ethic concerns to focus on character development and relationships. Although <b>the</b> <b>physicians</b> treat the illnesses of their patients, often through complex surgeries, their primary motivation is customarily praise and competition.|$|E
5|$|On 24 July 1837, Rajendra's {{youngest}} son, Devendra Bikram Shah, {{an infant}} of six months, died suddenly. It {{was at once}} rumored that the child had died of poison intended for his mother the Senior Queen Samrajya Laxmi Devi: given at the instigation of Bhimsen, or someone of his party. On this charge, Bhimsen, his brother Ranbir Singh, his nephew Mathbar Singh, their families, the court physicians, Ekdev and Eksurya Upadhyay, and his deputy Bhajuman Baidya, with a few more of the nearest relatives of the Thapas were incarcerated, proclaimed outcasts, and their properties confiscated. <b>The</b> <b>physicians</b> Ekdev and Eksurya, being Brahmins, were severely tortured but spared, while Bhajuman Baidya was impaled and killed. Under torture, Ekdev confessed, and thus confirmed a widely circulated rumor, that he was directed by Bhimsen to poison not just Devendra, but King Girvan as well.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} among historians that Bhimsen was not behind the poisoning. Bhimsen had nothing to gain by killing an infant less a year old, and the accusation was simply a ruse to answer foreign inquiries on Bhimsen's imprisonment. It was a general practice among <b>the</b> <b>physicians</b> of the time to check {{the strength of their}} medicine by first letting the mother taste it, before giving it to their new born. It was later rumored that it was the Junior Queen who had actually contrived to kill the Senior Queen by poisoning the medicine intended for her new born. While the poison did not express itself on the intended Queen, it managed to kill the infant prince, and the powerless Bhimsen was made a convenient scapegoat. Historian Gyanmani Nepal contends this to be closer to the truth.|$|E

5|$|The {{emergency}} room {{is filled with}} victims from a chain car accident, one of whom is admitted in the department of neurosurgery, under the care of Shepherd and Yang. As <b>the</b> <b>physicians</b> soon discover that he has been internally decapitated, they {{come to the conclusion that}} even a minor move would result in irreparable damage. A pregnant woman is admitted in plastic surgery, after having her arm severed. Meredith is assigned to work for Sloan during the day, and is immediately told to find the arm, much to the fascination of her interns. Despite trying to deal with her trainees in a strict manner, Stevens is looked upon as unprofessional by the interns she was assigned to. Her image is further deteriorated when she decides to abandon her hospital duties, in order to perform surgery on a deer, once again letting her emotional involvement interfere with her career. Meredith and Shepherd discuss the repercussions of their breakup, and realize that they cannot reconcile. However, the two engage in sexual intercourse, as a manner to express their mutual feelings for the last time. O'Malley comes to the realization of his love for Stevens, and quickly discloses to her that he shares her romantic feelings.|$|E
5|$|With the drama's setting being a hospital, {{numerous}} {{medical personnel}} appear regularly on the show, {{as well as}} several other recurring characters. Joe (Steven W.

In the first season, Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback), a nurse who appeared on the show occasionally until getting laid off in the merger with Mercy West, engages in sexual activity with O'Malley, giving him syphilis. Serving as an assistant and secretary to the Chief of Surgery, former nurse Patricia (Robin Pearson Rose), has appeared on the show since its debut. Tyler Christian (Moe Irvin), a hospital nurse, makes occasional appearances throughout the series. Within the second season, Bailey becomes pregnant by her husband, Tucker Jones (Cress Williams), who makes frequent appearances on Grey's Anatomy, until their divorce in season five. While Bailey takes a sabbatical, due to her pregnancy, the cheerful Dr. Sydney Heron (Kali Rocha), fills her position as the resident supervising Grey, Yang, Karev, O'Malley, and Stevens, and makes occasional appearances until the fifth season.|$|E
