40|$|In a {{previous}} paper (Part 1), the ideal soil fertility and the saturated soil fertility were expressed on a relative scale, called soil fertility grade (SFG). In the current paper (Part 11), {{the relation between}} SFG and soil test values is discussed. The required uptake of nutrients from the soil is translated into soil organic carbon, P-Olsen, exchangeable K, and pH (H 2 O) using relationships developed for a model on Quantitative Evaluation of the Fertility of Tropical Soils (QUEFTS). Target soil test values were calculated for target yields between 2 and 10 Mg ha(- 1) season(- 1). The required uptake of soil nitrogen {{is a function of}} <b>target</b> <b>yield,</b> and it is linearly related to soil organic carbon. Results of the calculations indicate that when target yields are less than 7 - 8 Mg ha(- 1), stover must be incorporated to maintain soil organic carbon above the critical level of 6 g kg(- 1). When yields are below 2 Mg ha(- 1), also organic sources from outside the field have to be brought in. The interpretation of chemical soil test values according to the ISF-SSF framework may be rather difficult in practice, as is demonstrated with eight African soils. The major reason is that the soil supplies of N, P and K seldom are in the same proportions as in ISF-SSF. For none of the used African soils replacement input or a neutral nutrient budget would be the best management option. Replacement input will often lead to inefficient use and even waste of nutrients. Optimum soil test values depend on <b>target</b> <b>yield,</b> but the ratios of soil test values do not depend on <b>target</b> <b>yield.</b> Therefore key values were established for the ratio of soil organic carbon to P-Olsen and for the ratio of soil organic carbon to the square root of exchangeable K. Based on these key values, a new classification scheme with recommended input ratios is presented. The scheme has six classes for N and P ratios, and seven classes for N and K ratios.

40|$|Abstract—Dual- design {{technique}} {{has proven to}} be extremely effective in reducing subthreshold leakage in both active and standby mode of operation of a circuit in submicrometer technolo-gies. However, aggressive scaling of technology results in different leakage components (subthreshold, gate and junction tunneling) to become significant portion of total power dissipation in CMOS cir-cuits. High- devices are expected to have high junction tunneling current (due to stronger halo doping) compared to low- devices, which in the worst case can increase the total leakage in dual-design. Moreover, process parameter variations (and in turn variations) are expected to be significantly high in sub- 50 -nm technology regime, which can severely affect the yield. In this paper, we propose a device aware simultaneous sizing and dual-design methodology that considers each component of leakage and the impact of process variation (on both delay and leakage power) to minimize the total leakage while ensuring a <b>target</b> <b>yield.</b> Our results show that conventional dual- design can overestimate leakage savings by 36 % while incurring 17 % average yield loss in 50 -nm predictive technology. The proposed scheme results in 10 %– 20 % extra leakage power savings compared to conventional dual- design, while ensuring <b>target</b> <b>yield.</b> This paper also shows that nonscalability of the present way of realizing high- devices results in negligible power savings beyond 25 -nm technology. Hence, different dual- process options, such as metal gate work function engineering, are required to realize high-performance and low-leakage dual- designs in future technologies.
