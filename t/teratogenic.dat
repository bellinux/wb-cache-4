5|$|Although {{the late}} stages of {{pregnancy}} {{are associated with}} an increase in sebaceous gland activity in the skin, pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity. In general, topically applied medications are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy, as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus. Highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide (category C) and azelaic acid (category B). Salicylic acid carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9–25%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in the uterus and early closure of the babies' ductus arteriosus blood vessel. Prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm. Tretinoin (category C) and adapalene (category C) are very poorly absorbed, but certain studies have suggested <b>teratogenic</b> effects in the first trimester. Due to persistent safety concerns, topical retinoids are not recommended for use during pregnancy. In studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy, fetal harm has not been seen {{in the second and third}} trimesters. Retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include the topical retinoid tazarotene, and oral retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin (all category X). Spironolactone is relatively contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to its antiandrogen effects. Finasteride is not recommended as it is highly <b>teratogenic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{ytterbium}} {{is fairly}} stable chemically, it {{is stored in}} airtight containers and in an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen-filled dry box {{to protect it from}} air and moisture. All compounds of ytterbium are treated as highly toxic, although studies appear to indicate that the danger is minimal. However, ytterbium compounds cause irritation to human skin and eyes, and some might be <b>teratogenic.</b> Metallic ytterbium dust can spontaneously combust, and the resulting fumes are hazardous. Ytterbium fires cannot be extinguished using water, and only dry chemical class D fire extinguishers can extinguish the fires.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{morphological}} data, Jack Garrick {{suggested in}} 1982 that the blacknose shark has a sister relationship {{to a group}} containing the whitecheek shark (C. dussumieri) and the blackspot shark (C. sealei), while Leonard Compagno proposed in 1988 that this shark belongs in a group with five other species, including the silky shark (C. falciformis) and the blacktip reef shark (C. melanopterus). Molecular analyses have been similarly equivocal regarding the blacknose shark's phylogenetic relationships: Gavin Naylor's 1992 allozyme analysis found this species {{to be the most}} basal member of Carcharhinus, while Mine Dosay-Abkulut's 2008 ribosomal DNA analysis indicated affinity between it and the blacktip shark (C. limbatus) or the smalltail shark (C. porosus). The whitenose shark (Nasolamia velox), found along the tropical western coast of the Americas, may be descended from blacknose sharks that experienced the <b>teratogenic</b> effects of incipient cyclopia.|$|E
25|$|Cannabis in {{pregnancy}} {{has been shown}} to be <b>teratogenic</b> in large doses in animals, but has not shown any <b>teratogenic</b> effects in humans.|$|E
25|$|Clinically, {{thalidomide}} {{has always}} {{been used as a}} racemate. Generally the S-isomer is associated with the infamous <b>teratogenic</b> effects of thalidomide and the R-isomer is devoid of the <b>teratogenic</b> properties but conveys the sedative effects, however this view is highly debated and {{it has been argued that}} the animal model that these different R- and S-effects were seen in was not sensitive to the thalidomide <b>teratogenic</b> effects. Later reports in rabbits, which is a sensitive species, unveiled <b>teratogenic</b> effects from both isomers. Moreover, thalidomide enantiomers have been shown to be interconversed in vivo due to the acidic chiral hydrogen in the asymmetric center (shown, for the EM-12 analog, in Figure 3), so the plan to administer a purified single enantiomer to avoid the <b>teratogenic</b> effects will most likely be in vain.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy is <b>teratogenic</b> during pregnancy, {{especially}} during the first trimester, {{to the extent that}} abortion usually is recommended if pregnancy in this period is found during chemotherapy. Second- and third-trimester exposure does not usually increase the <b>teratogenic</b> risk and adverse effects on cognitive development, but it may increase the risk of various complications of pregnancy and fetal myelosuppression.|$|E
25|$|The {{main issue}} with anticoagulation in {{pregnancy}} is that warfarin, {{the most commonly}} used anticoagulant in chronic administration, is known to have <b>teratogenic</b> effects on the fetus if administered in early pregnancy. Still, {{there seems to be no}} <b>teratogenic</b> effect of warfarin before six weeks of gestation. However, unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin do not cross the placenta.|$|E
25|$|Thalidomide was {{prescribed}} {{for treatment of}} HG in Europe until it was recognized that thalidomide is <b>teratogenic</b> and is a cause of phocomelia in neonates.|$|E
25|$|A review {{published}} in 2010 identified 6 main <b>teratogenic</b> mechanisms associated with medication use: folate antagonism, neural crest cell disruption, endocrine disruption, oxidative stress, vascular disruption and specific receptor- or enzyme-mediated teratogenesis.|$|E
25|$|Thalidomide was {{originally}} {{released in the}} Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) under the label of Contergan on October 1, 1957 by Chemie Grünenthal (now Grünenthal). The drug was primarily prescribed as a sedative or hypnotic, {{but it was also}} used as an antiemetic and sedative. The drug was banned in 1961 after its <b>teratogenic</b> properties were observed. The problems with thalidomide were, aside from the <b>teratogenic</b> side effects, both high incidence of other adverse reactions along with poor solubility in water and absorption from the intestines. Adverse reactions include peripheral neuropathy in large majority of patients, constipation, thromboembolism along with dermatological complications.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{pregnant}} women are often maintained on {{low molecular weight}} heparin until at least six weeks after delivery to avoid the known <b>teratogenic</b> effects of warfarin, especially {{in the early stages}} of pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|In animal models (rats), {{flucytosine}} {{has been}} found to be <b>teratogenic.</b> Sufficient human data does not exist. Pregnant women should be given flucytosine only if the potential benefits exceed the potential harm to the fetus.|$|E
25|$|There is {{inadequate}} evidence of safety in human pregnancy. Animal studies and {{many years of}} clinical experience suggest that fusidic acid is devoid of <b>teratogenic</b> effects (birth defects), but fusidic acid can cross the placental barrier.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} <b>teratogenic</b> {{properties}} of thalidomide were {{recognized in the}} mid-1960s, its anti-cancer potential was explored and two clinical trials were conducted in people with advanced cancer, including some people with multiple myeloma; the trials were inconclusive.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} two weeks after fertilization, {{radiation}} therapy is lethal but not <b>teratogenic.</b> High doses of radiation during pregnancy induce anomalies, impaired growth and intellectual disability, and there may be an increased risk of childhood leukemia and other tumours in the offspring.|$|E
25|$|Hence, while {{initially}} considered safe, {{the drug}} was responsible for <b>teratogenic</b> deformities in children born after their mothers used it during pregnancies, prior to the third trimester. In November 1961, thalidomide {{was taken off the}} market due to massive pressure from the press and public. Experts estimate that the drug thalidomide led to the death of approximately 2,000 children and serious birth defects in more than 10,000 children, about 5,000 of them in West Germany. The regulatory authorities in East Germany did not approve thalidomide. One reason for the initially unobserved side effects of the drug and the subsequent approval in West Germany was that at that time drugs {{did not have to be}} tested for <b>teratogenic</b> effects. They had been tested on rodents only, as was usual at the time.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that uranium has caused reproductive defects, and other health problems in rodents, frogs and other animals. Uranium was shown to have cytotoxic, genotoxic and carcinogenic effects in animal studies. It has been shown in rodents and frogs that water-soluble forms of uranium are <b>teratogenic.</b>|$|E
25|$|MDMA is a {{moderately}} <b>teratogenic</b> drug (i.e., it is toxic to the fetus). In utero exposure to MDMA {{is associated with}} a neuro- and cardiotoxicity and impaired motor functioning. Motor delays may be temporary during infancy or long-term. The severity of these developmental delays increases with heavier MDMA use.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that 10% of all birth defects are caused by prenatal exposure to a <b>teratogenic</b> agent. These exposures include, {{but are not limited}} to, medication or drug exposures, maternal infections and diseases, and environmental and occupational exposures. Paternal smoking use has also been linked to an increased risk of birth defects and childhood cancer for the offspring, where the paternal germline undergoes oxidative damage due to cigarette use. Teratogen-caused birth defects are potentially preventable. Studies have shown that nearly 50% of pregnant women have been exposed to at least one medication during gestation. During pregnancy, a female can also be exposed to teratogens from the contaminated clothing or toxins within the seminal fluid of a partner. An additional study found that of 200 individuals referred for genetic counseling for a <b>teratogenic</b> exposure, 52% were exposed to more than one potential teratogen.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of analogs of thalidomide was precipitated {{by the discovery}} of the anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory properties of the drug yielding a new way of fighting cancer as well as some inflammatory diseases after it had been banned in 1961. The problems with thalidomide included; <b>teratogenic</b> side effects, high incidence of other adverse reactions, poor solubility in water and poor absorption from the intestines.|$|E
25|$|The precise {{mechanism}} of action for thalidomide is unknown although efforts to identify thalidomide's <b>teratogenic</b> action generated 2000 research papers and the proposal of 15 or 16 plausible mechanisms by 2000. As of 2015 the main theories were inhibition {{of the process of}} angiogenesis, its inhibition of cereblon, a ubiquitin ligase, and its ability to generate reactive oxygen species which in turn kill cells.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} adverse effects include: {{hepatotoxicity}} (liver damage), ulcerative stomatitis, leukopenia and thus predisposition to infection, nausea, abdominal pain, fatigue, fever, dizziness, acute pneumonitis, rarely pulmonary fibrosis, and kidney failure. Methotrexate is <b>teratogenic</b> and hence is not advised {{for either the}} prospective father to take it before or for the mother to take it before or during pregnancy (pregnancy category X) and for a period after birth.|$|E
25|$|More than 75% {{of women}} with {{rheumatoid}} arthritis have symptoms improve during pregnancy but might have symptoms worsen after delivery. Methotrexate and leflunomide are <b>teratogenic</b> (harmful to foetus) and not used in pregnancy. It is recommended {{women of childbearing age}} should use contraceptives to avoid pregnancy and to discontinue its use if pregnancy is planned. Low dose of prednisolone, hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine are considered safe in pregnant persons with rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
25|$|X-rays and {{computerized}} tomography (CT) are not used, {{especially in the}} first trimester, due to the ionizing radiation, which has <b>teratogenic</b> effects on the foetus. No effects of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on the foetus have been demonstrated, but this technique is too expensive for routine observation. Instead, obstetric ultrasonography is the imaging method of choice in the first trimester and throughout the pregnancy, because it emits no radiation, is portable, and allows for realtime imaging.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Ito et al. {{reported}} that Cereblon, a DCAF protein, {{was a major}} target of the <b>teratogenic</b> compound thalidomide. Thalidomide and other derivatives such as pomalidomide and lenalidomide are known as immunomodulatory drugs (or IMiDs) and have been investigated as therapeutic agents for autoimmune diseases and several cancers - particularly myelomas. Recent reports show that IMiDs bind to CRL4CRBN and promote the degradation of IKZN1 and IKZN3 transcription factors, which are not normally targeted by CRL4 complexes.|$|E
25|$|In January 2013, {{scientists}} from Queen's University published a report analyzing lake sediments in the Athabasca region {{over the past}} fifty years. They found that levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) had increased as much as 23-fold since bitumen extraction began in the 1960s. Levels of carcinogenic, mutagenic, and <b>teratogenic</b> PAHs were substantially higher than guidelines for lake sedimentation set by the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment in 1999. The team discovered that the contamination spread farther than previously thought.|$|E
25|$|It may be carcinogenic, as it {{has been}} linked to cancer of the lungs, liver, and {{pancreas}} in laboratory animals. Other animal studies showed breast cancer and salivary gland cancer. Research is not yet clear as to what levels may be carcinogenic. DCM crosses the placenta. Fetal toxicity in women who are exposed to it during pregnancy, however, has not been proven. In animal experiments, it was fetotoxic at doses that were maternally toxic but no <b>teratogenic</b> effects were seen.|$|E
25|$|No studies examine topical {{salicylic}} acid in pregnancy. Oral {{salicylic acid}} is {{not associated with}} an increase in malformations if used during the first trimester, but in late pregnancy has been associated with bleeding, especially intracranial bleeding. The risks of aspirin late in pregnancy are probably not relevant for a topical exposure to salicylic acid, even late in the pregnancy, because of its low systemic levels. Topical salicylic acid is common in many over-the-counter dermatological agents and the lack of adverse reports suggests a low <b>teratogenic</b> potential.|$|E
25|$|Many {{studies have}} found no {{association}} between lamotrigine exposure in utero and birth defects, while those that have found an association have found only slight associations with minor malformations like cleft palates. Review {{studies have found}} that overall rates of congenital malformations in infants exposed to lamotrigine in utero are relatively low (1-4%), which is similar to the rate of malformations in the general population. It is known that lamotrigine is a weak inhibitor of human dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and other, more powerful, human DHFR inhibitors like methotrexate are known to be <b>teratogenic.</b>|$|E
25|$|While it {{has been}} {{difficult}} to establish specific health effects in humans {{due to the lack of}} controlled dose experiments, studies in animals have shown that dioxin causes a wide variety of toxic effects. In particular, TCDD (see this) has been shown to be <b>teratogenic,</b> mutagenic, carcinogenic, immunotoxic, and hepatotoxic. Furthermore, alterations in multiple endocrine and growth factor systems have been reported. The most sensitive effects, observed in multiple species, appear to be developmental, including effects on the developing immune, nervous, and reproductive systems. The most sensitive effects are caused at body burdens relatively close to those reported in humans.|$|E
25|$|The {{disease is}} caused by rubella virus, a {{togavirus}} that is enveloped and has a single-stranded RNA genome. The virus is transmitted by the respiratory route and replicates in the nasopharynx and lymph nodes. The virus {{is found in the}} blood 5 to 7 days after infection and spreads throughout the body. The virus has <b>teratogenic</b> properties and is capable of crossing the placenta and infecting the fetus where it stops cells from developing or destroys them. During this incubation period, the patient is contagious typically for about one week before he/she develops a rash and for about one week thereafter.|$|E
25|$|The Government of Gujarat had {{initiated}} {{a study in}} response to the workers' rally in Bhavnagar and representations made by Sishuvihar, an NGO based in Ahmadabad. The committee constituted for the study also included former Deputy Director of NIOH, Ahmadabad. The committee noted that the WHO, FAO, IARC and US EPA have indicated that endosulfan is not carcinogenic, not <b>teratogenic,</b> not mutagenic and not genotoxic. The highlight of this report is the farmer exposure study based on analysis of their blood reports for residues of endosulfan and the absence of any residues. This corroborates the lack of residues in worker-exposure studies.|$|E
25|$|One of the analogs of {{interest}} {{was made by}} isoindolinone replacement of the phthaloyl ring. It was given the name EM-12 (Figure 3). This replacement was thought to increase the bioavailability of the substance because of increased stability. The molecule had {{been reported to be}} an even more potent <b>teratogenic</b> agent than thalidomide in rats, rabbits and monkeys. Additionally, these analogs are more potent inhibitors of angiogenesis than thalidomide. As well, the amino-thalidomide and amino-EM-12 were potent inhibitors of TNF-α. These two analogs later got the name lenalidomide, which is the EM-12 amino analog, and pomalidomide, the thalidomide amino analog.|$|E
25|$|Several {{anticonvulsants}} {{are known}} to be highly <b>teratogenic.</b> Phenytoin, also known as diphenylhydantoin, along with carbamazepine is responsible for the fetal hydantoin syndrome, which may typically include broad nose base, cleft lip and/or palate, microcephalia, nails and fingers hypoplasia, intrauterine growth restriction and mental retardation. Trimethadione taken during pregnancy is responsible for the fetal trimethadione syndrome, characterized by craniofacial, cardiovascular, renal and spine malformations, along with a delay in mental and physical development. Valproate has anti-folate effects, leading to neural tube closure-related defects such as spina bifida. Lower IQ and autism have recently also been reported as a result of intrauterine valproate exposure.|$|E
25|$|Sodium amalgam {{containing}} 2–6% sodium (prepared by {{the treatment}} of ribbons of sodium metal with mercury(0)) is the most commonly employed reagent for the reductive desulfonylation and reductive elimination processes. Disodium hydrogen phosphate is used to buffer the solution at a pH of 7–8, meaning that base-labile functionality is stable under the reduction conditions. Reductions employing aluminum amalgam (prepared by immersion of aluminum foil into a 2% aqueous solution of HgCl2) often require higher temperatures than the corresponding sodium amalgam reactions. Mercury and mercury compounds are poisonous and <b>teratogenic,</b> and should be used only in a properly functioning chemical fume hood. Mercury cannot be destroyed {{but it can be}} removed from aqueous solutions by using ion-exchange resins or by amalgamation with iron.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} {{chemotherapeutic}} agents, docetaxel administered to pregnant animals causes {{a variety of}} embryofetal toxicities, including death, when given {{during the period of}} organogenesis. Yet adequate studies investigating maternal and fetal effects in humans are lacking. One small systematic review that examined the use of taxanes to treat breast cancer in pregnancy showed that, out of 19 patients, only three congenital malformations occurred. Two cases of cerebral ventriculomegaly observed in the study were documented prior to the administration of chemotherapy, suggesting an alternate cause of congenital malformation. The third case involved pyloric stenosis in an infant whose mother received a combination regimen of docetaxel, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel; because the fetus was exposed to multiple drugs in utero, it remains difficult to identify docetaxel as the causative <b>teratogenic</b> agent. Further studies are needed to better assess the safety of docetaxel in pregnancy and determine appropriate dosing in pregnant women.|$|E
