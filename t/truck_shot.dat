5000|$|Film historians Alain Silver and Elizabeth Ward comment, [...] "The film is {{particularly}} memorable {{for the use}} of the song 'Tango of Love' as leitmotif to indicate the putative reappearance of Katherine, with the background strings translating the scent of perfume; the opening <b>trucking</b> <b>shot</b> through the rain-soaked night up to the window of the Mason house, which allows the audience to eavesdrop on the dinner party; and the sinister appearance of Bogart as he steps out of the shadows to murder his wife." ...|$|R
50|$|He {{was murdered}} by alleged members of the Ku Klux Klan in a drive-by {{shooting}} on Wednesday, June 2, 1965, exactly one year and one day after his appointment as deputy sheriff.

50|$|Scenes {{in which}} John wears fire proof mask and burns down gang members with {{flamethrower}} {{were not in}} original cut of the movie. They were added during re-shoots and were filmed with Robert Ginty's stunt double. Originally only scene where John used the flamethrower to kill gang members was in the ending when he burns last few after he already killed {{most of the others}} with weapons from garbage <b>truck.</b> <b>Shot</b> of John taking his mask off in the ending after X dies is actually outtake edited from this same scene, which is why scene cuts abruptly when he starts taking the mask off. According to some interview from the time when movie was released, Ginty hated the way movie was cut down and re-edited by studio.|$|E

50|$|The <b>truck</b> stop <b>shots,</b> salt shaker C-Bass diner scene, leg on {{fire at the}} gas pump, {{restroom}} assault scene,and two-lane {{country road}} scenes were filmed in and around Fort Morgan, CO {{with a number of}} locals filling the extra roles.|$|R
50|$|Time-lapse can be {{achieved}} with some normal movie cameras by simply shooting individual frames manually. But greater accuracy in time-increments and consistency in exposure rates of successive frames are better achieved through a device that connects to the camera's shutter system (camera design permitting) called an intervalometer. The intervalometer regulates {{the motion of the}} camera according to a specific interval of time between frames. Today, many consumer grade digital cameras, including even some point-and-shoot cameras have hardware or software intervalometers available. Some intervalometers can be connected to motion control systems that move the camera on any number of axes as the time-lapse photography is achieved, creating tilts, pans, tracks, and <b>trucking</b> <b>shots</b> when the movie is played at normal frame rate. Ron Fricke is the primary developer of such systems, which can be seen in his short film Chronos (1985) and his feature films Baraka (1992, released to video in 2001) and Samsara (2011).|$|R
50|$|When used as {{a rolling}} mount, an {{extension}} of the carriage was fitted over the rear trucks to allow the ammunition car behind the mount to place ammunition on the <b>shot</b> <b>truck</b> which was then manually run up to the breech for loading. In an emplacement this extension was removed and ammunition hoisted up through a hatch {{on the floor of the}} mount, between the <b>shot</b> <b>truck</b> rails, from an ammunition car on the outer track and then lowered onto the <b>shot</b> <b>truck.</b> An estimated twelve men were required to ram the shell. It used the German naval system of ammunition where the base charge was held in a metallic cartridge case and supplemented by another charge in a silk bag which was rammed first. The existence of a shell with 55 km range must be regarded as unconfirmed, the longest engagement recorded for any of these guns was 44 km during the bombardment of Dunkerque by Batterie Pommern in Flanders in 1917—8.|$|R

40|$|Original held by ScreenSound Australia: Title No. 90133. Newsreel from 1944 about Land Army girls {{working on}} {{farms in the}} Griffith area of New South Wales. The item opens with shots of the Land Army women lined up in uniform and marching on parade; they are {{inspected}} by a female officer. The girls gather {{to listen to their}} instructions, and then travel to their jobs on a variety of transport: by bicycle, {{on the back of a}} truck, or by horse. A group of girls arrives at an orchard on the back of a horse-drawn cart, and there are close-up shots of them picking peaches, emptying the fruit from bags into boxes, and loading the boxes onto the back of a <b>truck.</b> <b>Shots</b> of a girl driving a team of four horses and another driving a tractor follow. Several girls load cabbages onto the back of a tractor, and feed them into the automatic planter as they are hauled on a sled (or 'rumble seat') behind the tractor.

25|$|The show parodies {{many things}} about popular culture, {{primarily}} being a spoof of {{shows such as}} Jackass; whereas they perform stunts designed to injure and/or humiliate an individual, the Fist team do things that would obviously kill them. Such as jumping off cliffs, being hit by <b>trucks,</b> getting <b>shot</b> in the head, etc. These dangerous stunts and outlandish actions are usually achieved {{with the use of}} computer generated imagery. Indeed, one of the most innovative and noteworthy features of Double the Fist is its extensive and imaginative use of CGI, especially considering that the programme was produced for a very low budget, even by Australian standards ($250,000 for all 8 episodes).|$|R
50|$|In 2009, Brockport saw {{its first}} {{homicide}} in 26 {{years in a}} shooting spree that ended in Canandaigua. On Saturday, February 14, 2009, shortly before 5 a.m., three people were shot, two fatally, by gunman Frank Garcia at Lakeside Memorial Hospital on West Ave. (NYS Route 19 <b>Truck).</b> Garcia later <b>shot</b> two other people dead.

50|$|In {{many states}} in the United States, it is impossible, {{as a matter of}} law, to attempt to commit a crime whose {{underlying}} mens rea is only recklessness. For example, in State v. Lyerla, the defendant Lyerla randomly <b>shot</b> into a <b>truck</b> three times after being goaded by the driver of the <b>truck.</b> One <b>shot</b> killed the driver and the others did not hit the driver or either of two passengers. The South Dakota Supreme Court found that although Lyerla was guilty of reckless second degree murder of the driver, he could not be guilty of recklessly attempting to murder the passengers, because attempt requires a higher level of intent than recklessness.|$|R
50|$|Sometime later, Mike is {{dispatched}} by Gus to stow away in {{the back}} of a Los Pollos Hermanos refrigerator truck that is transporting food supplies and methamphetamine. The truck is attacked by cartel gunmen. The driver is killed and the <b>truck</b> is <b>shot</b> up, but Mike, knowing the M.O. of previous hijackings, is able to survive the shooting and kills the hijackers when they break into the truck. In spite of all this, a small piece of his right ear is grazed by a bullet. Mike later catches a meth addict who has stolen money from Jesse and threatens to kill him in front of Jesse, but is surprised when Jesse calls the play as a bluff.|$|R
50|$|The next day, a {{helicopter}} arrives to airlift the survivors, but a truck arrives {{with two of}} Little Gustave's men, who fire a rocket at the helicopter. The group ducks, except for Matt, who runs after the helicopter to stop it from flying away. Matt is rammed by the <b>truck</b> and <b>shot</b> to death by the younger of the two militias, a teenager performing what is clearly his first execution. When {{the driver of the}} truck notices the rest of the group, Tim yells for them to split up. In the ensuing chase, both of Little Gustave's men are killed: when the truck crashes into the river, the teenager is thrown out and dies on impact, while the driver is shot by Aviva when he tries to strangle Tim to death.|$|R

5000|$|With Vivian Vachon as her partner, Casey {{defeated}} Donna Christanello and Cara Combs in a 1970 match.

Although the doctors {{told her that her}} professional wrestling career was over, Casey was able to wrestle again within several months. In 1974, Moolah offered to let Casey win the USA Women's Wrestling Championship from her, and Casey was subsequently never defeated for the belt. Later that year in December, Casey also won the vacated NWA United States Women's Championship by defeating Toni Rose in a match. She held the championship for approximately four years before losing it to Joyce Grable. Meanwhile, wrestling magazine Pro Wrestling Illustrated recognized Casey as the [...] "Girl Wrestler of the Year" [...] in 1975.|$|R

5|$|Quantum of Solace was {{the last}} in Ford Motor's three-film deal that began with 2002's Die Another Day. Although Ford sold over 90% of the Aston Martin company in 2007, the Aston Martin DBS V12 {{returned}} for the film's car chase around Lake Garda; Dan Bradley was hired as second unit director because of {{his work on the}} second and third Bourne films, so the film would continue the gritty action style begun in Casino Royale. He had intended to use Ford GTs for the opening chase, but it was replaced by the Alfa Romeo 159. After location filming in Italy, further close-ups of Craig, the cars and the <b>truck</b> were <b>shot</b> at Pinewood against a blue screen. Originally three Alfa Romeos were in the sequence: but Forster felt the scene was running too long and re-edited the scene so it only looked like two Romeos were chasing Bond.

2500|$|Evans later {{asserted}} that the tow truck was a ruse. He claimed police snipers were already {{in the area and}} targeting him and his followers for assassination.

[...] Instead, he said, he had left his home and was walking on west on Auburndale Avenue toward the Lakeview Tavern (a few feet around the corner to the south) when he heard shots [...] "coming {{from the end of the}} street". A man ran past him. Evans said he ran north to Beulah in time to see the tow truck operator running toward E. 123rd Street. He said he heard submachine gun fire, and said he assumed this was the blast which killed Leroy Mansfield Williams. Evans admitted that he fired several shots from his carbine, but the weapon then jammed. He fled into the home at 1384 Lakeview Road.|$|R
