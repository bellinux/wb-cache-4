A survey of <b>the</b> real <b>notes</b> was realized for evaluation of these notes.

In the survey it was found out that three errors you can find in <b>the</b> <b>notes</b> of unaudited companies on the average and that <b>the</b> <b>notes</b> of audited companies are worse than <b>the</b> <b>notes</b> of unaudited companies. The main finding is that you can find errors in <b>the</b> <b>notes</b> to <b>the</b> financial statements and these errors can reduce the explanatory power...|$|R

In the case, the mother was convicted and sentenced to twelve years. The file notes that she had a vision of her son dead before he disappeared, as did Bud on the night his daughter disappeared.|$|E
