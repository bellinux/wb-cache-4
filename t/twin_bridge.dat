25|$|By 1990, {{population}} growth and development on the Kitsap Peninsula caused vehicular traffic on the bridge to exceed its design capacity. In 1998, voters in several Washington counties approved an advisory measure to create a <b>twin</b> <b>bridge</b> to span the Tacoma Narrows. After a series of protests and court battles, construction began on the second span in 2002. The second span opened in July 2007 to carry eastbound traffic, and the 1950 bridge was reconfigured to carry westbound traffic.|$|E
500|$|The Polish {{historian}} [...] {{states in}} the 1967 Polish Biographical Dictionary that Kościuszko may be Poland's and the world's most popular Pole ever. There are monuments to him around the world, beginning with the Kościuszko Mound at Kraków, erected in 1820–23 by men, women, and children bringing earth from the battlefields where he had fought. [...] The Thaddeus Kosciusko Bridge, a <b>twin</b> <b>bridge</b> structure across the Mohawk River in Albany, New York, completed in 1959, and the Kosciuszko Bridge, built in 1939 in New York City, were named in Kościuszko's honor. The New York City bridge was replaced in 2017 by a new bridge of the same name, continuing Tadeusz Kościuszko's legacy.|$|E
500|$|State {{and federal}} {{agencies}} {{are in the process}} of replacing the Tappan Zee Bridge over the Hudson River. The original Tappan Zee bridge, carrying the concurrency of New York State Thruway, I-87, and I-287, is a cantilever bridge built during 1952–55. The bridge is [...] long and spans the Hudson at its second-widest point. The deteriorating current structure bears an average of 138,000vehicles per day, substantially more traffic than its designed capacity. During its first decade, the bridge carried fewer than 40,000vehicles per day. Part of the justification for replacing the bridge stems from its construction immediately following the Korean War on a low budget of only $81 million. Unlike other major bridges in metropolitan New York, the Tappan Zee was designed to last only 50years. The Federal Highway Administration issued a report in October 2011 designating the Tappan Zee's replacement to be a dual-span <b>twin</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E

[...] An extension further east to Calgary Trail was completed by October2006, creating a full southwest bypass of Edmonton. It includes a semi-circular arch structure that spans Whitemud Creek, and three arch bridges over Blackmud Creek. A $168million interchange that included seven bridges was constructed at Stony Plain Road, and the entire quadrant became free-flowing in late 2011 after the completion of smaller interchanges at Lessard Road, Callingwood Road, and Cameron Heights Drive. A flyover was originally planned on the western leg at 69Avenue before it was ultimately scrapped by Alberta Transportation.
