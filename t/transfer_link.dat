On 24 May 1866, Captain Rich of the Railway Inspectorate, examined the Innerleithen-Galashiels section of the North British Railway, and also the link line from the Caledonian. The link ran through several sidings in the NBR goods yard, and Captain Rich refused to sanction passenger operation on the link until the layout was altered. This was never done, and passenger operation was never authorised.|$|E

40|$|The CMS {{experiment}} at CERN {{is preparing}} for LHC data taking in several computing preparation activities. In early 2007 a traffic load generator infrastructure for distributed data transfer tests called the LoadTest was designed and deployed to equip the WLCG sites that support CMS with a means for debugging, load-testing and commissioning data transfer routes among CMS computing centres. The LoadTest is based upon PhEDEx as a reliable, scalable data set replication system. The Debugging Data Transfers (DDT) task force was created to coordinate the debugging of the data <b>transfer</b> <b>links.</b> The task force aimed to commission most crucial transfer routes among CMS sites by designing and enforcing a clear procedure to debug problematic links. Such procedure aimed to move a link from a debugging phase in a separate and independent environment to a production environment when a set of agreed conditions are achieved for that link. The goal was to deliver one by one working transfer routes to the CMS data operations team. The preparation, activities and experience of the DDT task force within the CMS experiment are discussed. Common technical problems and challenges encountered during the lifetime of the taskforce in debugging data <b>transfer</b> <b>links</b> in CMS are explained and summarized...|$|R
