5|$|Basset's {{rewards for}} his royal service {{included}} {{a number of}} manors. Basset was granted the manor of Mixbury by the king, after <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>that</b> held {{it at the time}} of Domesday Book died out and it escheated to the king. Other lands held by Basset were probably royal rewards also. One was Quiddenham, which had been held in 1086 by crown. Another was Stoney Stanton, originally held in 1086 by Robert Despenser.|$|E

30|$|First, {{introducing}} {{series of}} relevant polices about raising the fertility intention of “universal two-child”. The empirical analysis {{shows that the}} higher the fertility willingness of the “universal two-child policy”, the better the financial operation of pension fund. The following policies could be introduced: (1) maternity allowance for <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>that</b> have <b>the</b> second child, (2) income tax relief for <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>that</b> have <b>the</b> second child, (3) in implementing policies such as “low rent housing”, “affordable housing” give priority to <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>that</b> have <b>the</b> second child, (4) providing additional medical insurance benefits for <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>that</b> have <b>the</b> second child, (5) education fee, especially the cost at the university, is waivered for these families, (6) some preferential tax policies in domestic service industry are introduced, which reduces some pressure of rearing child.|$|R

After Barney drives the drunken men home in Homer's car, Homer allows him to use it to drive himself home, expecting Barney to return it the following morning. In his distressed state, Barney disappears with the car. Two months later, Barney returns to Moe's Tavern, unable to recall where he left the car. Homer later receives a letter from the New York City government, which informs him that his car has been found parked in the World Trade Center plaza. Homer reveals to <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>that</b> he had once been to New York before when he was 17 years old and had a horrible experience. Marge and the children persuade Homer to go retrieve the car and he reluctantly agrees.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{easy access to the}} ranch and any lodging in the area, {{tourists}} flocked to this site. The 1887 completion of the Southern Pacific line increased the number of visitors, as the railroad featured the ranch in its advertisements in order to distinguish the line from its competitors. Although the ranch was not developed for tourism, the Del Valles, with their Californio sense of hospitality, would lodge the visitors. By October 1888, housing visitors was getting to be so expensive for <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>that</b> Reginaldo del Valle pressed his mother to stop being so hospitable. The tourists could be quite a nuisance, and unscrupulous visitors would steal items from the house as souvenirs, or help themselves to fruit from the orchards.|$|E
40|$|The {{contribution}} {{shows the}} results of a research program about the processes of <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>that</b> have inside themselves a relative suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. A qualitative study to execute a comparison between <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>that</b> give help to their demented relative by themselves and <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>that</b> regularly use health services (Day Center). The analysis was conducted following the symbolic-relational approach and with it it was possible to find out some particular forms of government of familiar space and time. Particulary an important difference between the two sub-groups of families were recognized, either towards the inside dynamics and the relationship with outside environment. The total recognition of the obtained results in the two parts of the work gives us some interesting conclusions. The main of these is that it is very improper to consider the presence of depressive symptoms in the caregiver as the mark of a family disorder, because, on <b>the</b> contrary, <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>that</b> present “affective themes” of depressive character are those that work out more realistic meaning of the pathology and consequently react following more adaptive modalities...|$|R

5|$|Edwards {{was born}} in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of local {{merchant}} William Edwards, and Lucia Ransom. He graduated last in his class from the United States Military Academy in 1883. Upon his graduation from West Point, Edwards was appointed a second lieutenant in the Infantry Branch, serving with the 23rd Infantry Regiment. For {{the next several years}} Edwards served at various posts, including Fort Union, Fort Porter, Cleveland, Ohio (commanding the guard at the tomb of President Garfield), and Fort Davis. While stationed at Fort Porter he met Bessie Rochester Porter, a member of <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>that</b> included Peter Buell Porter, for whom the fort was named, and they were married in 1889.|$|E

Called affectionately Hawthorn Hill, {{building}} had begun in the Dayton suburb of Oakwood, Ohio, while Wilbur was in Europe. Katharine and Orville oversaw the project in his absence. Wilbur's one known expression upon {{the design of the}} house was that he have a room and bathroom of his own. The brothers hired Schenck and Williams, an architectural firm, to design the house, along with input from both Wilbur and Orville. Wilbur did not live to see its completion in 1914.|$|E

5|$|Later botanists, such as Philip Miller in 1754, divided cacti {{into several}} genera, which, in 1789, Antoine Laurent de Jussieu placed in his newly created family Cactaceae. By the early 20th century, botanists came to feel Linnaeus's name Cactus {{had become so}} {{confused}} as to its meaning (was it the genus or <b>the</b> <b>family?)</b> <b>that</b> {{it should not be}} used as a genus name. The 1905 Vienna botanical congress rejected the name Cactus and instead declared Mammillaria was the type genus of the family Cactaceae. It did, however, conserve the name Cactaceae, leading to the unusual situation in which the family Cactaceae no longer contains the genus after which it was named.|$|E
5|$|Like {{his father}} before him, Alec Waugh {{went to school}} at Sherborne, and, it was presumed by <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>that</b> Evelyn would follow, but in 1915, the school asked Alec to leave, after a {{homosexual}} relationship came to light. Alec departed Sherborne for military training as an officer, and, while awaiting confirmation of his commission, wrote The Loom of Youth (1917), a novel of school life, which alluded to homosexual friendships at a school that was recognisably Sherborne. The public sensation caused by Alec's novel so offended the school that it became impossible for Evelyn to go there. In May 1917, much to his annoyance, {{he was sent to}} Lancing College, in his opinion, a decidedly inferior school.|$|E
5|$|No. 1 Royal Crescent is a {{historic}} house museum, owned and maintained by the Bath Preservation Trust through its membership to illustrate how wealthy owners of the late 18th century might have furnished and occupied such a house. It was purchased in 1967 by Major Bernard Cayzer, a member of <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>that</b> made its fortune through the Clan shipping line. He donated it to the Trust with an amount of money for its restoration and furnishing. The restoration was led by Philip Jebb. The Bath Preservation Trust was working during 2012–13 to re-unite Number One with its original servants' wing at Number 1A Royal Crescent, {{which has been in}} use as a separate dwelling for many years. No. 1 serves as the Trust's headquarters. Number 15 and 16 are still used as a hotel.|$|E

5|$|St Gwenllwyfo's Church is a 19th-century parish church {{near the}} village of Dulas, in Anglesey, north Wales. It was built between 1854 and 1856 to replace an earlier church in the parish, also {{dedicated}} to St Gwenllwyfo, which needed repair and had become too small for its congregation. The new church was built nearer to the Llys Dulas estate, whose owner contributed £936 towards the total cost of £1,417, rather than near the area where many of the parishioners lived. In 1876, Sir Arundell Neave (who had married into <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>that</b> owned Llys Dulas) donated 27 panels of 15th and 16th-century stained glass that had once belonged to a Flemish monastery.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} of Theobald of Bec to the Archbishopric of Canterbury was {{announced at the}} Council of Westminster in 1138. The medieval chronicler Gervase of Canterbury writes that 17bishops attended the council, which implies that Alexander was present. After a failed expedition to Normandy in 1137, the influence of Alexander's uncle, Roger of Salisbury, waned at the court of King Stephen, but the king took no action against <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>that</b> might incite them to rebel. In early 1139 Stephen may have named William d'Aubigny as Earl of Lincoln, perhaps {{in an effort to}} limit Alexander's influence in Lincolnshire.|$|E
5|$|The {{second and}} more {{important}} friendship was with Fanny (Frances) Blood, introduced to Wollstonecraft by the Clares, a couple in Hoxton who became parental figures to her; Wollstonecraft credited Blood with opening her mind. Unhappy with her home life, Wollstonecraft struck {{out on her own}} in 1778 and accepted a job as a lady's companion to Sarah Dawson, a widow living in Bath. However, Wollstonecraft had trouble getting along with the irascible woman (an experience she drew on when describing the drawbacks of such a position in Thoughts on the Education of Daughters, 1787). In 1780 she returned home, called back to care for her dying mother. Rather than return to Dawson's employ after the death of her mother, Wollstonecraft moved in with the Bloods. She realized during the two years she spent with <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>that</b> she had idealized Blood, who was more invested in traditional feminine values than was Wollstonecraft. But Wollstonecraft remained dedicated to her and her family throughout her life (she frequently gave pecuniary assistance to Blood's brother, for example).|$|E
