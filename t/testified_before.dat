5|$|In one of {{her last}} public appearances, Carson <b>testified</b> <b>before</b> President John F. Kennedy's Science Advisory Committee. The {{committee}} issued its report on May 15, 1963, largely backing Carson's scientific claims. Following the report's release, she also <b>testified</b> <b>before</b> a U.S. Senate subcommittee to make policy recommendations. Though Carson received hundreds of other speaking invitations, {{she was unable to}} accept the great majority of them. Her health was steadily declining as her cancer outpaced the radiation therapy, with only brief periods of remission. She spoke as much as she was physically able, however, including a notable appearance on The Today Show and speeches at several dinners held in her honor. In late 1963, she received a flurry of awards and honors: the Audubon Medal (from the National Audubon Society), the Cullum Geographical Medal (from the American Geographical Society), and induction into the American Academy of Arts and Letters.|$|E

Former KGB agent Victor Sheymov <b>testified</b> <b>before</b> Congress in 1998 that the fire was deliberately induced by the Soviets in an effort to gain access to sensitive areas by agents posing as firemen.|$|E
5|$|The {{disappearance}} attracted sustained {{international interest}} and saturation {{coverage in the}} UK reminiscent {{of the death of}} Diana in 1997. The McCanns were subjected to intense scrutiny and baseless allegations of involvement in their daughter's death, particularly in the tabloid press and on Twitter. In 2008 they received damages and front-page apologies from Express Newspapers, and in 2011 they <b>testified</b> <b>before</b> the Leveson Inquiry into British press misconduct, lending support to those arguing for tighter press regulation.|$|E

5|$|After he <b>testified</b> <b>before</b> a {{grand jury}} in New York, he was indicted on perjury charges. Although Spivey was not convicted when the case went to trial in 1953, he was {{prevented}} from competing in the National Basketball Association (NBA) afterward.

Spivey retired in 1968 and became a businessman, working in sales and operating restaurants. Upset by the accusations against him in the early 1950s, he was reclusive in his final years.|$|E
5|$|Although it was {{cut short}} by Roosevelt's desire to have him testify before Congress on Lend-Lease, Willkie's visit to Britain was deemed a triumph. Willkie also went to Ireland, hoping to persuade Ã‰amon de Valera to abandon neutrality, but his urging was unavailing. Willkie left London for Washington on February 5; {{because of the risk}} of being shot down by Nazi aircraft, the {{roundabout}} journey home took four days. He <b>testified</b> <b>before</b> the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 11, and his support was key to passing Lend-Lease.|$|E

5|$|An {{advocate}} for universal and single-payer health care, Wolf is {{a supporter of}} both Massachusetts health care reform and President Barack Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). On July 10, 2012 Wolf <b>testified</b> <b>before</b> the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to discuss {{the effects of the}} two laws. Despite repeated jabs by Republican members on the committee that it laws would stifle business and hurt employees, Wolf defended the reforms waveringly. Wolf's further statements on the positive aspects of PPACA were eventually cut short by Chairman Darrell Issa, a staunch PPACA opponent. Wolf supported a failed amendment in 2012 which would have implemented single-payer health care in Massachusetts if a study proved it was more effective in reducing costs than the state's current model.|$|E
