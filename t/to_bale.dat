5|$|In July 2008, Christian Bale was {{filming a}} scene in New Mexico for the film Terminator Salvation with actress Bryce Dallas Howard. The film's {{director}} of photography, Shane Hurlbut, walked into Bale's line of sight, and the actor proceeded to yell obscenities at Hurlbut. Bale said he would quit the film if Hurlbut repeated the error and was not subsequently fired. Hurlbut responded calmly and apologized several times <b>to</b> <b>Bale,</b> and continued shooting for seven hours after the incident.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} effects of applying liquid corn condensed distillers solubles to grass-hay windrows prior <b>to</b> <b>baling</b> on storage, bale temperature, and nutrient composition. Application of the wet material did not impair the ability of hay to expel heat post-baling in either study. Increased CP and decreased NDF for hay treated with corn condensed distillers solubles indicated successful within-bale storage occurred. Results suggest application prior <b>to</b> <b>baling</b> is a feasible strategy for storing liquid co-products while improving forage quality...|$|R

25|$|Brigadier-General Arthur W. Vanaman, {{the highest-ranking}} USAAF officer {{captured}} in the European Theatre of Operations. Vanaman, an intelligence officer, succeeded Spivey as SAO in mid-1944. He had (like Spivey) been captured after flying as an observer on a bombing mission. The crew had advised Vanaman <b>to</b> <b>bale</b> out after his aircraft {{had been hit by}} flak and filled with smoke. This, ironically, had been caused by the ignition of a harmless smoke marker and the bomber had returned to base safely.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{contrasting}} conventional silage additives on chemical composition, aerobic stability and deterioration, and mould development in baled silage were investigated. Herbage from a grassland sward was wilted for 24 h and treated with acid (formic or sulphuric), sugar (molasses), bacterial (Lactobacillus plantarum, L. plantarum + Serratia rubidaea + Bacillus subtilis, or L. buchneri) or sugar + bacterial (molasses + L. plantarum) additives prior <b>to</b> <b>baling</b> and wrapping. Silage made without an additive preserved well {{and had a}} low incidence of mould growth, {{and the effects of}} additives were minor or absent. It is concluded that little practical benefit was realised when conventional additives were applied to wilted, leafy, easy-to-ensile grass prior <b>to</b> <b>baling</b> and ensilage. peer-reviewe...|$|R

50|$|When {{electricity}} arrived, the bale spear, pulley {{and track}} system {{were replaced by}} long motorized bale conveyors known as hay elevators. A typical elevator is an open skeletal frame, with a chain that has dull 3 in spikes every few feet along the chain <b>to</b> grab <b>bales</b> and drag them along. One elevator replaced the spear track and ran {{the entire length of}} the peak of the barn. A second elevator was either installed at a 30-degree slope on the side of the barn <b>to</b> lift <b>bales</b> up <b>to</b> the peak elevator, or used dual front-back chains surrounding the <b>bale</b> <b>to</b> lift <b>bales</b> straight up the side of the barn to the peak elevator.|$|R

25|$|In July 2008, Bale {{flew into}} an angry tirade {{on the set}} of Terminator Salvation, while filming in New Mexico. In February 2009, the audio {{recording}} of the incident was released. The tirade was directed at Shane Hurlbut, director of photography for the film. According <b>to</b> <b>Bale,</b> Hurlbut had, for the second time, ruined his concentration by walking onto the set during a scene. The recording is of Bale directing profanities at Hurlbut, threatening and belittling him, and finally threatening to quit the film if Hurlbut repeated the offense without being fired for it. It was reported that Warner film executives sent the tape to the insurer of the film in case Bale decided to quit the movie.|$|E
25|$|Following {{these early}} records, {{there is no}} {{information}} until the late 1950s, when Finnish geographer, Helmer Smels, arrived in Bale. He made three journeys <b>to</b> <b>Bale</b> and crossed the area from Goba, through Rira to Delo-Mena. By {{the time of his}} visits, just 50 years after Vicomte du Bourg had noted the presence of elephants, they had disappeared from the Harenna Forest. Smels noted that although the Sanetti Plateau was uninhabited, people drove their cattle to the plateau for grazing during the dry season, sometimes for up to three months. Additionally, the mountains were used for their mineral springs or horas, to which the pastoral people also drove their cattle. People stayed overnight in simple, temporary shelters made of split bamboo. The Harenna Forest was uninhabited but for small groups of temporary huts in some of the clearings where people grazed their cattle for part of the year. Although not dwelling there permanently, honey gatherers have always been active in the Harenna Forest.|$|E

25|$|In January 1941, he was {{appointed}} a flight commander of No. 41 Squadron RAF. With the squadron he flew fighter sweeps and bomber escort sorties over Nazi occupied France. On 14 August 1941, he was flying over France escorting bombers whose target was the St Omer railyards near Lille. One of the Blenheim bombers was attacked by two Messerschmitt 109 fighters. He went to its aid, shooting {{down one of the}} Messerschmitts. However, in the dogfight with the remaining Nazi fighter, his spitfire sustained damage and burst into flames. He was forced <b>to</b> <b>bale</b> out at a low altitude from his out of control aircraft. He landed safely and a French farmer immediately ushered him to a cornfield where he hid until nightfall. The farmer' son, Felix Caron, then arrived to bring him to the safety of their farm in Saint-Folquin. On 25 August 1941, his commission was confirmed and he was promoted to war substantive flying officer with seniority in that rank from 15 August 1941. After two weeks in a French Resistance safe house, the French speaking Winskill was moved down the Pat Line. He travelled to the Pyrenees and then, via Andorra, Barcelona and Madrid, to British Gibraltar. He arrived back in England in December 1941; it had taken him three months to arrive back in England after being shot down.|$|E

500|$|In 2008, Hurlbut again {{worked with}} {{director}} McG, {{as director of}} photography on the film Terminator Salvation. During shooting for the film in July 2008, Hurlbut faced an expletive-ridden tirade from actor Christian Bale, who berated Hurlbut for walking into a scene involving Bale and actress Bryce Dallas Howard. Hurlbut responded calmly and apologized several times <b>to</b> <b>Bale,</b> and continued shooting for seven hours after the incident. On February 6, 2009, Bale told KROQ-FM radio that he and Hurlbut talked after the incident and [...] "resolved this completely". Bale acknowledged the two worked together for several hours after the incident, and [...] "at least a month after that", and noted [...] "I've seen a rough cut of the movie and he has done a wonderful job.

After the accident, he was declared unfit for flying duties until April 1940, when he was posted to No. 139 Squadron for active service due to the outbreak of war. He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 21 May 1940.|$|E
500|$|Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright, a human-terminator hybrid experiment. Worthington {{compared}} Marcus to Dorothy Gale and Alice due {{to being}} [...] "this person {{waking up in}} another world [...] tries to find himself". Terminator creator James Cameron personally recommended Worthington (whom he directed in Avatar) to McG. Russell Crowe also recommended him to McG. The director decided Worthington looked tougher than the [...] "great many of today's [...] young male actors". Worthington recalled Cameron told him [...] "the Terminator to make is {{the one with the}} war". Worthington tore his intercostal muscles during the first weeks of filming but nevertheless insisted on performing his own stunts. McG once expressed interest in casting Christian Bale, Daniel Day-Lewis or Josh Brolin in the part. Brolin did talk <b>to</b> <b>Bale</b> and read a draft of the screenplay, which he found [...] "interesting and dark; ultimately, though, I didn't think it felt right".|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>Bale</b> {{breaking his}} hand and Worthington hurting his back, special effects technician Mike Menardis almost lost his leg filming an explosion. The sequence required a manhole cover being blown into the air, which hit Menardis and partially severed his leg. McG noted it was {{a testament to the}} gritty style of the film. [...] "I say with respect, I didn't want that Star Wars experience of everything's a blue screen, tennis balls, and go for it. I had Stan Winston build all the machines. We built all the sets, the explosive power, the explosive power so you feel that wind and that percussion and that heat blowing your eyebrows off. And with that, you get a couple bumps and bruises on the way, but you get it in an integrity and a realism that hopefully echoes Apocalypse Now. You couldn't say, 'Let's just shoot Apocalypse Now in Burbank, I think it's going to feel just as good.|$|E
500|$|Designers {{improved}} on {{the design}} of the Batsuit from Batman Begins, adding wide elastic banding to help bind the costume <b>to</b> <b>Bale,</b> and suggest more sophisticated technology. It was constructed from 200 individual pieces of rubber, fiberglass, metallic mesh, and nylon. The new cowl was modeled after a motorcycle helmet and separated from the neck piece, allowing Bale to turn his head left and right and nod up and down. The cowl is equipped to show white lenses over the eyes when the character turns on his sonar detection, which gives Batman the white eyed look from the comics and animation. The gauntlets have retractable razors which can be fired. Though the new costume is eight pounds heavier, Bale found it more comfortable and not as hot to wear. The depiction of Gotham City is less gritty than in Batman Begins. [...] "I've tried to unclutter the Gotham we created on the last film," [...] said production designer Nathan Crowley. [...] "Gotham is in chaos. We keep blowing up stuff, so we can keep our images clean." ...|$|E
500|$|The Luftwaffe {{launched}} a major attack against key Maltese airfields at dawn on 20 March. Leggo, {{who had not}} slept for over 24hours, returned to the airfield {{in the early hours}} having spent the night with a girlfriend.

Plagis attempted to stop his friend from going, but Leggo insisted on flying, and took off at 08:05 as {{part of a group of}} four Spitfires and 12 Hurricanes aiming to intercept a squadron of Messerschmitt Bf 109s. He was soon seen to be flying poorly. A German pilot noticed this and attacked Leggo from close range, seriously damaging his aircraft and forcing him <b>to</b> <b>bale</b> out. Another Bf 109 then swooped and either fired at Leggo or collapsed his parachute with its slipstream, causing him to fall to his death. When Plagis learned what had happened, he was inconsolable, holding himself responsible. In his journal, he vowed to [...] "shoot down ten for Doug—I will too, if it takes me a lifetime".|$|E
