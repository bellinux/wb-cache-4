50|$|The {{precedents}} of Bohemian Rhapsody {{are as much}} in the 19th-century classical {{traditions of}} rhapsodic, quasi-improvisational reveries - like, say, the piano works of Schumann or Chopin or the tone-poems of Strauss or Liszt - as they are in prog-rock or the contemporary pop of 1975. Thats because the song manages a sleight of musical hand that only a handful of real master-musicians have managed: the illusion that its huge variety of styles - from intro, to ballad, to operatic excess, to hard-rock, to reflective coda - are unified into a single statement, a drama that somehow makes sense. Its a classic example of the unity in diversity that high-minded musical commentators have heard in the symphonies of Beethoven or the operas of Mozart. And <b>thats</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> the piece is: a miniature operatic-rhapsodic-symphonic-tone-poem.|$|E

"The Cardiff accent {{has been}} {{analysed}} {{by a number}} of dialect experts from England and they tend to emphasise the influence of immigrants from Ireland and the South West of England. But they often forget about the impact the local dialect of Welsh has had on the citys accent. Everyone knows that Cardiffians tend to pronounce their ah sounds more like an eh sound - for instance, Kairdiff rather than Cardiff, dairk instead of dark, etc. But <b>thats</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> local Welsh speakers would have done years ago. Turning their as into es is one of the characteristics of Y Wenhwyseg (the older, local dialect). Perhaps the non-Welsh speaking residents of Cardiff are more faithful to the original pronunciation than the Welsh speakers who have moved to the city in recent years!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Editor of MSN TV, Lorna Cooper {{commented on}} Annalises {{relationships}} and her appearance, stating: [...] "Annalise had a convoluted love life during her time on Ramsay Street; she dated old geezer Lou Carpenter (how? How {{in the name}} of logic did that happen?) and even got dumped at the altar when her boyfriend decided he wanted to become a priest. Needless to say, the soap made good use of Annalises assets." [...] Telecommunications network Orange profiled past Neighbours characters, in this feature they describe Annalises most memorable moment as being her wedding ceremony to Mark. All About Soap magazine placed Annalise and Marks wedding at number eight on their twenty greatest soap weddings list. The magazine said [...] "Annalise looked more likely to make a priest renounce his vows than drive a man into the arms of the church, but <b>thats</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> happened when Mark ditched Neighbours hottest babe at the altar to devote his life to God.

5000|$|Ruth Deller of {{entertainment}} website Lowculture expressed her sadness over Harolds cancer storyline saying, [...] "Poor Jellybelly. There {{might have been}} a little bit of tear-shedding this week at his cancer diagnosis and trip to Madges grave. We love you Hazza! The current web campaigns to get Ian Smith a golden logie after 20 years on Neighbours also have our support, in a very nominal kind of way." [...] Of his 2009 departure, Deller said [...] "Actor Ian Smith is retiring, which is the kind of behaviour we expect from normal people, not soap stars. He and his wife are going to be grey nomads - the term for Australians who spend their retirement travelling the country in trailer homes. And in a case of art imitating life, <b>thats</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> Hazza will be doing[...]. To be fair, although Im sad to see old Jelly Belly depart, its a nice way to go: much better than him having a second screen death, or moving to live with the whiny Sky. Considering that Harold has had one of the most tragic lives of any Ramsay Street resident (two dead wives, two dead children, a dead grandchild, a dead daughter in law, being missing presumed dead for several years, watching Sky turn from fierce funky teen to moaning nymphomaniac, becoming insane and murderous, being conned by a variety of unscrupulous women and so on), giving him a happy ending is even sweeter."

5000|$|The album {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} on release. Artist Direct gave a positive review, saying [...] "its like theyve transmuted {{the ferocity of}} their classic self-titled debut, Home, and Animosity into the sharp, succinct songwriting sensibility of Cold Day Memory." [...] Similarly Allmusic stated that [...] "Black Out The Sun is such a solidly constructed album that its hard to fault these guys for doing what they do best and giving the people the kind of skull-crushing hard rock that theyre asking for." [...] Imdb also reviewed the album, stating, [...] "While {{the tone of the}} material on this album is a bit darker and more ominous, its still every bit as much a Sevendust project; a few elements here began life in another form during Cold Day Memorys songwriting sessions, but as a whole the tense, urgent vibe here falls more in line with their groundbreaking 2001 release Animosity." [...] Larry Petro from KNAC gave the album 5 out of 5, stating, [...] "I absolutely love it when a band puts out an album that is great from start to finish, with no urge to skip a track, and <b>thats</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> Sevendust has done with Black Out The Sun." [...] The Aquarian Weekly reviewer praised the album, saying, [...] "This album shows the group remains dedicated to their craft, excited about making new music and eager to embrace the risks that go with it. And thats {{the kind of thing that}} will keep the fans excited for a good while longer." [...] Dusty Peters from UnRated Magazine wrote, [...] "Black Out the Sun is one of the most complete metal albums that has been released in quite some time. A fan or not of Sevendust, after listening to Black Out the Sun, you will truly experience the love that the band has for music and themselves. With over 16 years together and 9 recorded albums to their name, Sevendust has completed their musical journey to the top with Black Out the Sun." ...|$|E
5000|$|Minaj {{received}} {{four out}} of five stars from many reporters throughout the European leg of the tour, including Katie Fitzpatrick from the Manchester Evening News, Kirsty McHale from the Liverpool Echo, Lisa-Marie Ferla from the Herald Scotland, and Simon Duke from Chronicle Live. Fitzpatrick greatly applauded Minaj and the overall feel of the show stating [...] "Minajs rapping is on fire" [...] and that [...] "the costume changes are just as exciting as her rhymes." [...] Fitzpatrick also praised the final portion of the show saying it was [...] "irresistibly fun" [...] and that Minaj [...] "had us all leaving the arena still in full flight with joyous abandon." [...] McHale also gave positive feedback of Minajs performance, versatility, and nature of the tour saying [...] "For all of the outrageous costume changes and dance moves (of which there were many), there were also moments of substance where she showcased her vocal talents, such as Save Me and Marilyn Monroe. And her rapping was flawless all night long." [...] She extended her praise by saying [...] "when you go to see Nicki Minaj, you go to be entertained, and <b>thats</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> we got." [...] Ferla in particular praised the slower section of the show stating that [...] "Pills n Potions featured a breathtaking vocal performance, while Pink Friday: Roman Reloadeds Marilyn Monroe gave me Ferla chills." [...] Duke also commended Minajs versatility by stating [...] "We all know she can rap {{with the best of them}} but she also has a rather useful set of pipes with their shining moment coming in the epic Marilyn Monroe from Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded." [...] Duke also highly praised the final quarter of the show and its uplifting feeling when he said [...] "I don’t think I’ve witnessed a more inspired back to back than Va Va Voom, Pound the Alarm, Turn Me On and Bang Bang - the quartet of chart smashes got everyone in the party mood." [...] He further proclaimed the show was a success and stated [...] "The enthusiastic crowd were sent on their way home with a swagger in their step thanks to a thumping encore of Starships which capped a stellar showing from their idol." ...|$|E

40|$|Using {{solar energy}} {{is clearly an}} {{important}} part of creating a sustainable future. <b>Thats</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> the small company Absolicon Solar Collectors placed in Härnösand thinks and carries through. By developing and manufacturing concentrated solarcollectors with a complete runningcentral for producing steam intended for industrial purpose are they pushing the technology and industry forward. They have so far manufactured small volumes of pilot plants but will now have the ability to manufacture larger volumes. To accomplish that they will {{have to be able to}} speed up the manufacturing process regarding some of the processes in the manufacturing line. As a part of the first station in the line will they need a method to semi automatically bend the two longest edges of the collector. It is this method this thesis is all about. A functional prototyp is also a part of the desired result. Roll forming became the method of choice. After choosing method was a small research around the subject accomplished containing visits at companies and literature studying. The demands of the curvature of the bends were also more closely investigated to get a better grip of the demands on the roll forming mill. Rollforming is an effective way to change the profile of steel plates and strips. The higher rollspeed the faster rollforming. By calculating tension and elongation of the steel or by testing can the number of passes and the length of the mill be determined. In the part theory of the report is essential theory and rules regarding roll forming compiled for simple calculations and general understanding of some of aspects in roll and mill design. In the part method of the report is the work regarding planning and contructing the two hand made prototypes. Prototype one is manufactured for the purpose of testing stands, shafts and rolls. Derived from the results of testing prototype one is the final prototype constructed and made. The work is resulting in a final prototype containing two passes which is not producing the desired final bend angle but the function of the roll forming as a method can still be validated and presented. The steel strip is easily by hand dragged trough the mill and no defects or other problem were encountered. The final prototype is not fully meeting the demands of the final bend angle due to the short deadline it was made in. Two more passes are still needed do be added for the final angle. As a conclusion is roll forming as a method really suitable for this bending operation because of its simplicity, low cost, small physicall measurments and high forming speed...|$|E
