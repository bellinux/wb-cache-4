40|$|AbstractGeosynthetic-reinforced load <b>transfer</b> <b>platforms</b> are {{commonly}} used in constructions over column-reinforced soft soils and correspond to modifications of conventional granular load <b>transfer</b> <b>platforms</b> that utilise only the arching effect of the granular soil to transfer the loads onto the columns. Both a single geosynthetic layer and several geosynthetic layers {{can be used to}} reinforce the granular soil of a platform. Most of the studies published in the literature address the use of single geosynthetic-reinforced platforms, while {{there is a lack of}} studies on multilayer geosynthetic-reinforced platforms. In the present study, to help overcome that lack, a jet-grout column-reinforced soft soil foundation with a platform that incorporates five geosynthetic layers is analysed. A parametric study is also performed in order to analyse the influence of four key factors. A numerical code based on the finite element method is used, incorporating a fully coupled analysis and soil constitutive relations simulated by the p-q-θ critical state model. The study mainly shows that a larger number of geosynthetic layers within the platform brings about better geotechnical behaviour of the column-reinforced soft soil foundation in terms of the settlement and the load transfer onto the columns...|$|R

50|$|VugaPay {{was founded}} by two Rwandan brothers, Patrick Muhire and Cedrick Muhoza. After {{a few years of}} {{watching}} M-pesa evolve from a small <b>transfer</b> <b>platform</b> into a full-blown payment solution, Patrick wondered what it might look like if it were redesigned from the ground up; purely for all countries.According to Patrick, the idea of VugaPay originated when Patrick wanted to transfer money from one mobile network operator to another. The process of sending money from one mobile network operator to another was a hassle, so they started working on a way to send money across all mobile network operators, interoperability for mobile money. Their original prototype sent money through MTN, TIGO, AIRTEL in Rwanda, but they eventually transitioned from Rwanda to the whole of East Africa, connecting telecoms in those regions.|$|E
5000|$|In 2015 NEST’s {{backbone}} is up. The {{construction of}} the first modules gets underway. The same year, Empa opens a second demonstration and technology <b>transfer</b> <b>platform</b> in the mobility sector: “move”, which enables new vehicle drive concepts with considerably lower CO2 emissions to be developed and tested in practice. These include hydrogen vehicles, various hybrid concepts or optimized gas vehicles. The energy source is currently electricity from photovoltaic plants or hydroelectric power stations that temporarily fluctuates heavily and is not needed on the power grid. It is initially converted into hydrogen or methane by electrolyzing water (power-to-gas concept). At the same time, a third platform commences operations: ehub (Energy Hub), which acts {{as a kind of}} nerve center to control and coordinate energy flows between NEST and “move” with their various energy users and sources. ehub should therefore guarantee an optimized energy supply, especially using heavily fluctuating energy sources such as solar and wind power. The platform therefore has diverse temporary storage facilities for the various energy sources.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{the design and}} {{evaluation}} of a software-based wireless power <b>transfer</b> <b>platform</b> that enables {{the development of a}} prototype involving various open- and closed-loop power control functions. Our platform is based on a loosely coupled planar wireless power transfer circuit that uses a class-E power amplifier. In conjunction with this circuit, we implement flexible control functions using a National Instruments Data Acquisition (NI DAQ) board and algorithms in the MATLAB/Simulink. To verify the effectiveness of our platform, we conduct two types of power-control experiments: a no-load or metal detection using open-loop power control, and an output voltage regulation for different receiver positions using closed-loop power control. The use of the MATLAB/Simulink software {{as a part of the}} planar wireless power <b>transfer</b> <b>platform</b> for power control experiments is shown to serve as a useful and inexpensive alternative to conventional hardware-based platforms...|$|E
40|$|A pile-supported {{embankment}} {{constructed on}} TH 241 near St. Michael, MN was instrumented with 48 sensors, including strain gages on the piles {{and on the}} geogrid, as well as earth pressure cells and settlement systems near {{the base of the}} embankment. Pile supported embankments are relatively novel structures employed largely at bridge approaches and highway expansions where soft soils would otherwise lead to unacceptably large differential settlements. The structure typically consists of a number of capped piles, well-compacted gravel, and one or more layers of geogrid reinforcement above the piles. Analyses of the data suggest that the redistribution of the embankment load to the piles occurs within and above the so-called load <b>transfer</b> <b>platform,</b> a 1 m layer of geogrid-reinforced gravel. Arching seemed to take place within the embankment, such that the stress {{at the top of the}} platform was concentrated above the piles. 17. Document Analysis/Descriptors 18.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a structural analysis procedure for flexible geogrid/geotextile reinforced load transfer platforms used for pile/column supported embankments. Design {{of these systems}} must consider strain compatibility between the expected settlement of soils between piles combined with the tensile stiffness and deformation of the load <b>transfer</b> <b>platform</b> reinforcements. When relatively small settlements are expected, significantly stiffer reinforcement materials are necessary to transfer greater loads to piles at lower reinforcement strain and settlement levels. This simplified analysis procedure matches theory for uniformly loaded cables to the calculation of reinforcement elongation and force mobilization caused by the assumed deformed shape occurring between piles and using site settlement estimates and a specified geogrid/geotextile force versus strain curve. The analysis procedure described considers both a soil-arching load case and a full tributary block load case. The procedure allows for rapid estimation of load <b>transfer</b> <b>platform</b> reinforcement strength and stiffness requirements and pile loads for designs. An example problem simulating a 40 -ft tall embankment overlying soft soil is provided. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate how variations in pile spacing, embankment height, subsoil compressibility, and reinforcement stiffness affect the predicted pile supported embankment behavior.

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{presented}} at The XXVII ISPIM Innovation Conference – Blending Tomorrow’s Innovation Vintage, Porto, Portugal on 19 - 22 June 2016. The full conference proceedings are available to ISPIM members at www. ispim. org. The importance of intermediation in university-industry collaboration (UIC) has been widely acknowledged, however, the phenomenon of UIC online tools is not yet studied in detail. In this paper, we examine fifteen UIC online platforms, identify their functions and role that they play in UIC. By combining secondary data with interviews with platform developers and users, we identify five main archetypes of collaborative online platforms: education-focused, knowledge <b>transfer</b> <b>platforms,</b> crowdsourcing platforms, networking tools and platforms for innovation marketing. We also present {{a number of the}} benefits the platforms bring. These tools reduce the time and resources spent establishing and managing collaborations; they help to make networking more targeted; they help to reveal the value that university research has for business and increase the adoption of university education. Our findings suggest that whilst facing some challenges, the platforms analysed represent a scalable, rapidly growing and more importantly demand-led business opportunity...|$|R
