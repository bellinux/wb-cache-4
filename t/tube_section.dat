40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} the {{indirect}} extrusion of seamless aluminum tubes with variable wall thickness was investigated. Therefore, an axially moveable stepped mandrel was applied. Investigations revealed that wall thickness transitions {{can either be}} graded over the tube length or very sharp. The microstructures in thin-walled and thick-walled <b>tube</b> <b>sections</b> were investigated. The local variation of the extrusion ratio and with that the tube wall thickness, product velocity and product temperature during the process lead to significantly different local microstructures at TB= 400 °C. At TB= 500 °C the microstructure was homogeneously recrystallized with similar grain size in all different <b>tube</b> <b>sections.</b> Furthermore, the mechanical tube properties were characterized by three point bending tests...|$|R

50|$|The second {{tower is}} located {{adjacent}} to the first, and contains two slides manufactured by WhiteWater West: H2Go Racer and 360Rush. H2Go Racer is an eight-lane Whizzard Twist where riders race head-first on a mat down the slide to the runout chutes. Riders begin by entering an enclosed <b>tube</b> <b>section</b> where the individual lanes are braided. The lanes then enter a 360-degree helix, before emerging for a final open drop. The second ride is the 360Rush, a set of four AquaLoop looping water slides.

40|$|Spacecraft {{processing}} presents unique {{problems for}} the design of ground support equipment. A telescoping tube system consists of a number of nested structural tubes that can be extended and retracted (telescoped) while supporting a load. A typical telescoping tube system provides lateral, torsional, and vertical support for an access platform. Several concepts for improved telescoping tubes were developed with emphasis placed on reliability, ease of maintenance, and cost effectiveness. The most promising prototype design utilizes adjustable rollers running on tracks bolted to the <b>tube</b> <b>sections.</b> A wire rope deployment system ensures that all <b>tube</b> <b>sections</b> are controlled during extension and retraction. Track shimming and roller adjustment allow for fabrication of a high precision tube assembly that does not require extensive machining or unusually large shop equipment. The use of rolling contact eliminates the contamination problems encountered with sliding tubes in previous designs. The prototype design is suitable for indoor or outdoor use. A prototype tube assembly was fabricated and tested for strength, stiffness, maintainability, and endurance...|$|R
40|$|The Engineering Test Unit (ETU) of COR 1 {{was made}} in two configurations. The first configuration, ETU- 1, was for {{vibration}} testing, while the second, ETU- 2, was for optical testing. This is {{a report on the}} optical testing performed on ETU- 2 at the NCAR/HAO Vacuum Tunnel Facility during the months of October and November, 2002. This was the same facility used to test the two previous breadboard models. In both configurations, the first two <b>tube</b> <b>sections</b> were complete, with all optical elements aligned. The vibration model ETU- 1 had the remaining <b>tube</b> <b>sections</b> attached, with mass models for the remaining optics, for the various mechanisms, and for the focal plane assembly. It was then converted into the optical model ETU- 2 by removing <b>tube</b> <b>sections</b> 3 to 5, and mounting the remaining optics on commercial mounts. (The bandpass filter was also installed into tube 2, which had been replaced in ETU- 1 by a mass model, so that pre- and post-vibration optical measurements could be made.) Doublet 2 was installed in a Newport LP- 2 carrier, and aligned to the other optics in the first two <b>tube</b> <b>sections.</b> The LP- 2 adjustment screws were then uralened so that the alignment could be maintained during shipping. Because neither the flight polarizer nor Hollow Core Motor were available, they were simulated by a commercial polarizer and rotational mount, both from Oriel corporation. The Oriel rotational stage was not designed for vacuum use, but it was determined after consultation with the company, and lab testing, that the stage could be used in the moderate vacuum conditions at the NCAR/HAO facility. The shutter and focal plane assembly were simulated with the same camera used for the previous two breadboard tests. The focal plane mask was simulated with a plane of BK 7 glass with a mask glued on, using the same procedure as for the Lyot spot on Doublet 1, and mounted in an adjustable LP- 2 carrier. Two masks were made, one made to the precise specifications of the optical design, the other slightly bigger to make alignment easier...|$|R
50|$|Riders {{begin by}} {{climbing}} 65 {{feet to the}} top of the Blastenhoff tower. Two-passenger rafts are brought {{to the top of}} the tower on a conveyor belt. After passengers board and once the blocking systems indicates the channel ahead is clear, a small conveyor rolls the raft forward into the first drop — the ride's largest. At the bottom of the drop, water jets propel the raft uphill into a small dip and then another short uphill section. The raft then enters an enclosed <b>tube</b> <b>section</b> and travels 190 degrees back the other direction. This section features two drops and two uphill blasts followed by a right turn in an enclosed tube. Upon exiting the tube the raft drops downhill, turns right again then drops downhill a second time. Another uphill blast leads to a downhill section then the final uphill blast sends the rafts into an enclosed tube with a right turn helix followed by a left turn then a final small drop into the splash pool.|$|E

[...] The Jantar 2 made its first flight on 2 February 1976. It was followed in production by the Jantar 2B, which differs chiefly in the position of its wing, raised on the fuselage by 125 mm (4.9 in) from mid-wing to shoulder position and with its angle of incidence reduced by 1.5°, better to align the fuselage and airflow at the attitude assumed in high speed flight. It also has an increase in water ballast capacity. This variant first flew on 13 March 1978.|$|E
