5|$|During {{the second}} half of 1967, the North Vietnamese instigated a series of actions in the border regions of South Vietnam. All of <b>these</b> <b>attacks</b> were {{conducted}} by regimental-size NVA/NLF units, but unlike the usual hit-and-run tactics used by the People's Army forces, these were sustained and bloody affairs.|$|E
5|$|Many of <b>these</b> <b>attacks</b> against Americans {{were against}} Darlington personally. His son Christopher {{was hit by}} a grenade in July, though it did not detonate. The {{ambassador}} resigned his post on 26 July. It was not until 14 August 1965 that David M. Bane replaced him.|$|E

5|$|Soviet {{preparations}} {{also included}} increased activity of Soviet partisans, who attacked German communications and supply lines. The attacks were mostly behind Army Group North and Army Group Centre. In June 1943, partisans {{operating in the}} occupied area behind Army Group Centre destroyed 298 locomotives, 1,222 railway wagons and 44 bridges, and in the Kursk sector there were 1,092 partisan attacks on railways. <b>These</b> <b>attacks</b> delayed the build-up of German supplies and equipment, and required the diversion of German troops to suppress the partisans, delaying their training for the offensive. Central Partisan Headquarters coordinated many of <b>these</b> <b>attacks.</b> In June Soviet Air Forces (VVS) flew over 800 sorties at night to resupply the partisan groups operating behind Army Group Centre. The VVS also provided communication and sometimes even daylight air-support for major partisan operations.|$|E
5|$|The diversionary attacks went well, with Soviet forces acting {{under the}} {{impression}} that the Poles had targets other than Vilnius. Despite their diversionary intent, <b>these</b> <b>attacks</b> succeeded in their own right, with Generał Józef Adam Lasocki taking Lida in two days despite unexpectedly strong resistance, and Generał Stefan Mokrzecki taking Nowogrodek in three days and Baranowicze in four.|$|E
5|$|Allied forces {{conducted}} many {{air raids}} on Japan during World War II, causing extensive destruction to the country's cities and killing between 241,000 and 900,000 people. During {{the first years}} of the Pacific War <b>these</b> <b>attacks</b> were limited to the Doolittle Raid in April 1942 and small-scale raids on military positions in the Kuril Islands from mid-1943. Strategic bombing raids began in June 1944 and continued until the end of the war in August 1945. Allied naval and land-based tactical air units also attacked Japan during 1945.|$|E

5|$|Australians {{participated in}} attacks on German defences in France {{in the weeks}} before D-Day. No.453 Squadron made four raids on radar {{stations}} in late May and early June, and RAAF pilots serving with British fighter and fighter-bomber squadrons took part in other such attacks. The four Australian heavy bomber squadrons contributed aircraft to raids on radar stations and communications facilities in the week before the landing. These units also struck German coastal batteries along the channel coast on nine occasions between 8 and 29 May; Australians serving with British light bomber units took part in a further 14 raids on German batteries. The RAAF heavy bomber squadrons and Australians in RAF light and heavy bomber units also participated in raids against German Army camps in France and Belgium during May. The Australian squadrons suffered heavy losses in several of <b>these</b> <b>attacks,</b> including seven aircraft lost during a raid on the 21stPanzer Division's facilities at Mailly-le-Camp on the night of 3/4 May. In addition to <b>these</b> <b>attacks</b> on German positions, Bomber Command struck the seven largest German munitions factories and ammunition dumps in France during late April and early May; the four Australian squadrons participated in five of these operations, and no Australian aircraft were lost.|$|E
5|$|Bad weather {{resulted}} in a decline of anti-shipping operations, and before long the Ju 87 groups began re-deploying to Poland, {{as part of the}} concealed build-up for Operation Barbarossa. By spring 1941, only St.G 1 with 30 Ju 87s remained facing the United Kingdom. Operations on a small scale continued throughout the winter months into March. Targets included ships at sea, the Thames Estuary, the Chatham naval dockyard and Dover and night-bomber sorties made over the Channel. <b>These</b> <b>attacks</b> were resumed the following winter.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>these</b> <b>attacks</b> {{and those}} from the extreme left, the ECSC found {{substantial}} public support, {{and so it was}} established. It gained strong majority votes in all eleven chambers of the parliaments of the Six, as well as approval among associations and European public opinion. In 1950, many had thought another war was inevitable. The steel and coal interests, however, were quite vocal in their opposition. The Council of Europe, created by a proposal of Schuman's first government in May 1948, helped articulate European public opinion and gave the Community idea positive support.|$|E

5|$|Elephants can exhibit {{bouts of}} {{aggressive}} behaviour {{and engage in}} destructive actions against humans. In Africa, groups of adolescent elephants damaged homes in villages after cullings in the 1970s and 1980s. Because of the timing, <b>these</b> <b>attacks</b> have been interpreted as vindictive. In parts of India, male elephants regularly enter villages at night, destroying homes and killing people. Elephants killed around 300 people between 2000 and 2004 in Jharkhand while in Assam, 239 people were reportedly killed between 2001 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|Five North Korean Army (KPA) {{divisions}} massed {{around the}} city preparing to cross the Naktong River and assault it {{from the north and}} west. Defending the city were the 1st Cavalry Division and the ROK II Corps. In a series of engagements, each of the North Korean divisions attempted to cross the Naktong and attack the defending forces. The success of <b>these</b> <b>attacks</b> varied by region, but attacks in the 1st Cavalry Division sector were repulsed and the attacks in the South Korean sector were more successful.|$|E
5|$|Following Operation Paravane, the German Navy's {{commander}} {{decided to}} use Tirpitz as a static artillery battery to protect the town of Tromsø.

5|$|Four EEF {{infantry}} brigades of 10,000 rifles attacked four Ottoman regiments of 4,500 rifleswhich were {{reinforced by}} two divisions to over 8,000. Both sides suffered heavy losses. The attacks {{were to be}} carried out by well-prepared troops, with overwhelming artillery support and six Mark IV tanks. <b>These</b> <b>attacks</b> were designed to keep the Gaza garrison of 8,000 riflemen supported by 116 guns in place after the capture of Beersheba and during preparations for the main EEF attacks on Hareira and Sheria.|$|E

5|$|In February 1793, amid rising {{political}} tension, the French Republic {{declared war}} on Great Britain, drawing Britain into the French Revolutionary Wars. At sea, the Bay of Biscay, the Western Approaches and the English Channel all became areas of significant naval activity as French privateers sailed on raiding cruises against British merchant shipping. To augment <b>these</b> <b>attacks,</b> the French naval authorities dispatched squadrons of frigates to attack British trade routes. To counter these operations, the Royal Navy sent their own frigates to sea, sometimes in squadrons and sometimes on single patrols.|$|E

5|$|In {{the closing}} days of World War I, the Conference of Ambassadors drew the first {{demarcation}} line between Poland and Lithuania on June 18, 1919.

Attempting to halt further hostilities, Marshal of France Ferdinand Foch proposed a new line, known as the Foch Line, on July 18, 1919.|$|E

To prepare for <b>these</b> <b>attacks,</b> US Navy submarines sailed into Japan's inshore waters to search for naval mines. USAAF B-29 Superfortress and B-24 Liberator aircraft also conducted photo reconnaissance flights over much of Japan in search of airfields and facilities which could be attacked by the Third Fleet.|$|E
