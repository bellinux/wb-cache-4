25|$|Many {{countries}} have passed safety standards limiting {{the types of}} toys that can be sold. Most of these seek to limit potential hazards, such as choking or fire hazards that could cause injury. Children, especially very small ones, often put toys into their mouths, so the materials {{used to make a}} toy are regulated to prevent poisoning. Materials are also regulated to prevent fire hazards. Children have not yet learned to judge what is safe and what is dangerous, and parents do not always <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> possible situations, so such warnings and regulations are important on toys.|$|E

During his illness in 1928, one of his doctors, Sir Farquhar Buzzard, was asked who had saved the King's life. He replied, [...] "The Queen". In 1935, King George V and Queen Mary celebrated their silver jubilee, with celebrations taking place throughout the British Empire.

500|$|Most of {{the names}} were based on [...] "Southern puns", and it took Chun a while to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the names. All of the props, cards, and box were {{designed}} by the series' prop department. The producers tried to market the game as a real product, although that never came to fruition. Chun crafted the cold open after being inspired by the second season episode [...] "The Fight" [...] {{because he wanted to}} see more [...] "Karate Dwight". In the original version of the open, the scripted featured Dwight and Michael kicking each other in the groin. Jennifer Celotta, however, suggested that Dwight fight himself. The episode guest-stars Andy Buckley, who plays David Wallace. Buckley appears only via the telephone, and recorded his lines in the annex of the set, to give the illusion that he was calling from a long ways away.|$|E

Nas narrates the tale in conventional fashion until the ending, at which the track rewinds to an earlier point and he revises his original ending. [...] "Everybody's Crazy" [...] features complex rhymes and braggadocio rap by Nas: [...] "Gangsta see, gangsta do / A Langston Hughes predecessor / Gun in my dresser, slang I use." [...] In [...] "Purple"s narrative, Nas lights up a blunt and expresses his thoughts, including criticism of hoodlums and their effect on their neighborhoods: [...] "The 'hood love you, but behind your back they pray for the day / A bullet hit your heart and ambulance take you away / That ain't love it's hate / <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the mothers at wakes / Whose sons you've killed and you ain't got a cut on your face?"

Later it was revealed that the song had made Rowland’s vocals swell. During {{an interview}} for The Belfast Telegraph, Rowland spoke of the songs she had recorded for her third studio album. When speaking of [...] "Rose Colored Glasses", she said that it had taken its toll on her, “It brought back a few memories, and when I recorded it I cried so much my vocal chords got swollen."

500|$|Rossio and Marsilii {{believe that}} many of the {{negative}} reviews of Déjà Vu are a direct result of Scott's direction of the film, and have stated that [...] "Tony Scott added nothing to Déjà Vu and made several hundred small mistakes and about eight or nine deadly mistakes", which makes the film seem like it has many unforgivable plot holes, when it should not have had any. [...] "here are no plot holes at all, and scrutiny reveals the plot to be air tight." [...] says Rossio. [...] "We had years to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> this and work it out." [...] It was felt there were many misunderstandings that Scott's take on the plot introduced into the film. In his own defense, Scott cited in an interview with Iain Blair of BNET that only nineteen weeks were provided for the production of the film, which [...] "isn't a lot for a film like Déjà Vu." ...|$|E
500|$|Sean Hayes {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Jack. When a NBC casting {{executive}} saw Hayes's role in the indie gay romance film Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss, he sent the script to Hayes, who was attending the 1997 Sundance Film Festival in Utah. Even though Hayes enjoyed the script when he read it, he threw it away as {{he did not want to}} spend money on a plane ticket to Los Angeles for the audition. However, a few weeks later when Hayes was in Los Angeles, he was sent the script again and decided to try out for the audition. If asked if he regrets accepting the role, Hayes said: [...] "If you're truly an actor, in the long run... I don't know that I would have done it either. I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the things that I still want to do, and I don't know if I'll get to do them." [...] However, he admits that he [...] "love" [...] the idea that people assume that he is either gay or straight.

500|$|In a {{negative}} review, Robert Christgau from The Village Voice found Dr. Dre's lyrics distastefully misogynistic, writing [...] "it's a New Millennium, but he's Still S.L.I.M.E. ... For an hour, with time {{out for some}} memorable Eminem tracks, Dre degrades women every way he can <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> <b>all</b> of which involve his dick." [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot said Dr. Dre's production boasted unique elements but [...] "the endless gangsta babble, with its casual misogyny and flippant violence," [...] sounded flagrantly trite. AllMusic's Erlewine spoke of how the number of guest rappers affected the album, and questioned his reasons for collaborating with [...] "pedestrian rappers". He claimed that [...] "the album suffers considerably as a result [...] ". Erlewine criticized the lyrics, which he said were repetitive and full of [...] "gangsta clichés". Sinclair mentioned similar views of the lyrics, calling them [...] "filthy", but noted [...] "none of [...] should diminish Dre's achievement". NME spoke of how the lyrics were too explicit, stating, [...] "As the graphic grooves stretch out, littered with gunfire, bombings and 'copters over Compton, and the bitch-beating baton is handed from Knock-Turnal to Kurupt, 2001 reaches gangsta-rap parody-level with too many tracks coming off like porno-Wu outtakes." [...] Massey referred to the lyrics as a [...] "caricature of an ethos [...] than a reflection of any true prevailing beliefs." ...|$|E

500|$|Much of Ianto's {{character}} development is centred on the character's relationship with Captain Jack. On the character's evolution from minor character to romantic interest, Gareth David-Lloyd has commented that [...] "To have a storyline where you're {{involved with the}} leading character for any actor is awesome." [...] On the character's development, David-Lloyd has said that through Jack's relationship, [...] "he's found his meaning and ... he's happier." [...] Asked {{what it is that}} Ianto receives from Jack, David-Lloyd responds [...] "Support, meaning. I think he lost meaning. He was tortured and Jack gave him that meaning back. And reliability that he'll always be there, I think." [...] John Barrowman and Gareth David-Lloyd have also opined that Jack's relationship with Ianto has however brought out Jack's empathy, and helped to ground him, with John Barrowman reported as saying that Ianto [...] "brings out the 'human' in him, it brings out more of the empathy because he's actually fallen for someone and he really cares about somebody. So, it's really great and I think that's what makes him warm to other people. It makes him more approachable." [...] In the same interview, Gareth David-Lloyd said of the relationship and his character that [...] "I think Ianto's always made him care and that is really the heart of the show. Ianto's always bearing his emotional side and vulnerable side and keeping his feet on the ground. I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the characters, he's the one who tries to keep everyone else's feet on the ground. He brings everyone back to reality, often with a dry, witty remark or taking a dig at somebody just to sort of bring people back down." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cromwell led a Parliamentary {{invasion}} of Ireland from 164950. Parliament's key opposition was the military {{threat posed by}} the alliance of the Irish Confederate Catholics and English royalists (signed in 1649). The Confederate-Royalist alliance was judged {{to be the biggest}} single threat facing the Commonwealth. However, the political situation in Ireland in 1649 was extremely fractured: there were also separate forces of Irish Catholics who were opposed to the royalist alliance, and Protestant royalist forces that were gradually moving towards Parliament.

She was considered a pre-revolution (1968) Gaullist figurehead, and hated by the left. Stark was also exhausted and overweight by this time. Pierre Delanoë wrote a passionate song about Joan of Arc in [...] for Mireille. The final lyric: [...] "When I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> I have given France... and she has forgotten me" [...] was truly how the singer felt as she was made a caricature by the Communists in power.
