25|$|Rhode-Island, July 26. This Day, 26 of the Pirates {{taken by}} his Majesty Ship the Greyhound, Captain Solgard, were {{executed}} here. Some of them delivered what <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in writing, {{and most of}} them said something at the Place of Execution, advising all People, young ones especially, to take warning by their unhappy Fate, and to avoid the crimes that brought them to it. Their black Flag, under which they had committed abundance of Pyracies and Murders, was affix'd to one Corner of the Gallows. It had in it the Portraiture of Death, with an Hour-Glass in one Hand, and a Dart in the other, striking into a Heart, and three Drops of Blood delineated as falling from it. This Flag they called Old Roger, and us'd to say, They would live and die under it.|$|E

When the Sci-Fi Channel was launched, the first broadcast was a dedication to two [...] "science fiction pioneers": Isaac Asimov and Roddenberry. The Roddenberry crater on Mars is named after him, as is the asteroid 4659 Roddenberry. Roddenberry and Star Trek have been cited as inspiration for other science fiction franchises, with George Lucas crediting the series for enabling Star Wars to be produced. J.

After hearing what <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> the prince dismissed all except Coventry and Williams, and called for Gordon-Cumming, who told Edward that the accusation was [...] "foul and abominable"; the prince pointed out that [...] "there are five accusers against you". Gordon-Cumming then withdrew while the royal party discussed what the next steps would be. He returned {{after half an hour}} to find just the two courtiers, who urged him to sign a document that they had drafted. Under pressure, and still denying the accusations, Gordon-Cumming signed the document without knowing who else would sign it afterwards.|$|E
500|$|Frederick {{wrote to}} Elgin in January 1895 that Karim was deeply unpopular in the Household, {{and that he}} {{occupied}} [...] "very much {{the same position as}} John Brown used to". Princesses Louise and Beatrice, Prince Henry of Battenberg, Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, and Secretary of State for India Henry Fowler had all raised concerns about Karim with the Queen, who [...] "refused to listen to what <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> but was very angry, so as you see the Munshi is a sort of pet, like a dog or cat which the Queen will not willingly give up". Elgin was warned by both Ponsonby and the India Office that the Queen gave his letters to the Munshi to read, and that consequently his correspondence to her should not be of a confidential nature. Victoria's advisors feared Karim's association with Rafiuddin Ahmed, an Indian political activist resident in London who was connected to the Muslim Patriotic League. They suspected that Ahmed extracted confidential information from Karim to pass onto the Amir of Afghanistan, Abdur Rahman Khan. There is no indication that these fears were well-founded, or that the Munshi was ever indiscreet.|$|E

2500|$|Library {{activists in}} the 1930s {{pressured}} the American Library Association to be more responsive to issues put forth by young members involved with issues such as peace, segregation, library unions and intellectual freedom. [...] In 1931, the Junior Members Round Table (JMRT) was formed to provide a voice for the younger members of the ALA, but much of what <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> resurfaced in the social responsibility movement to come years later. [...] During this period, the first Library Bill of Rights (LBR) was drafted by Forrest Spaulding to set a standard against censorship and {{was adopted by the}} ALA in 1939. [...] This has been recognized as the moment defining modern librarianship as a profession committed to intellectual freedom and the right to read over government dictates. [...] The ALA formed the Staff Organization's Round Table in 1936 and the Library Unions Round Table in 1940.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the negotiators}} reached Athens, {{they made a}} speech to the Athenian {{assembly}} in which they argued that the Athenians should take advantage of the opportunity they had to make peace. The Spartans, they claimed, had suffered a misfortune not through incapacity or overreaching, but through mere bad luck; the Athenians should seize this opportunity to have peace with them on good terms. This proposal, however, met with derision from the Athenian statesman Cleon; he demanded far harsher terms, which would have given Athens control over Megara and compelled Sparta to abandon several important allies. [...] In his speech, he recalled the concessions Athens had been forced to make in the Thirty Years' Peace of 445 BC, when the Athenians had been at a similar momentary disadvantage. Cleon's terms, Donald Kagan has argued, represented a recognition that the Athenians had little to gain from a peace which surrendered the advantage they had just won without impairing the Spartans' ability to make war, while they might secure far better terms in the future by pressing their advantage. When the Spartans asked to discuss these proposals in private, Cleon demanded that they say whatever <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in public. By doing so, he guaranteed that the Spartans would be forced to cut off the negotiations (since they could hardly discuss betraying their allies in public), hastening the moment when the Athenians would be free to move against Sphacteria.|$|E
