40|$|Private {{business}} investment has expanded remarkably in Colombia's recent economic recovery. Sustained expansion of this investment is considered crucial to continued {{economic growth and}} increases in production. Having analyzed demand, the cost of capital, and the availability and allocation of investable funds, the paper makes the following conclusions. First, motivating firms to expand capacity is a key requirement for continued expansion. Secondly, frequent forecasting of such variables as GDP, interest and exchange rates, and credit and monetary aggregates, would tend to improve the climate for investment. Also, the real (marginal) cost of capital to the nonfinancial corporate sector is high: currently about 16 percent. Policy efforts that induce corporations to substitute equity for debt financing should {{lead to a more}} balanced corporate capital structure and possibly a lower overall cost of capital. It could also be reduced by shifting the tax <b>treatment</b> of depreciation <b>allowances</b> away from historical cost accounting system toward a replacement cost accounting system. Finally, high inflation and low savings rates keep the prevailing lending rates high in Colombia - and it is generally easier for larger firms to get capital than for small and medium-size firms.

40|$|With the {{commencement}} of Phase III of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) in 2013, it is projected that approximately one-half of emission allowances will be acquired through auctioning {{and the provision of}} free allocations to installations will be substantially tightened. As a result, it is likely that many companies will hold purchased (as opposed to freely allocated or gratis) allowances and will have more significant liabilities under the scheme. The accounting <b>treatment</b> of emission <b>allowances</b> has therefore become more relevant and the lack of uniformity in practice that resulted after the withdrawal of IFRIC 3 is now a more pressing concern. This study uses content analysis to examine disclosed accounting policies of companies with significant emission liabilities under the EU ETS and identifies three more common approaches adopted to date. These can be generally described as the following: (i) a net liability approach, based on the classification of allowances as intangibles but only showing an emission liability when it exceeds the free allocation; (ii) an approach broadly based on IFRIC 3 (recognising the free allocation at fair value and a corresponding gross liability under the EU ETS); and (iii) an approach based on inventory classification, with free allocations given at nil value. The diversity in these treatments highlights the need for guidance from the International Accounting Standards Board. 17 page(s...|$|R

The study was carried out with 27 Polwarth wethers throughout five 28 -day periods, in a completely randomized experiment, which included three paddocks per treatment and three tester animals per paddock. Forage mass varied from 2878 to 6580 kg of DM/ha and was directly related to forage allowance. Leaves proportion (mean of 23 %) and leaves growth rate (mean of 25 kg of DM/ha/day) varied between experimental periods in a similar rate for all treatments.

A total of 3, 000 one-day-old female breeders Ross 308, distributed in 20 pens, was randomly assigned to each <b>treatment.</b> Feed <b>allowance</b> was weekly adjusted to reach the desired BW. Feed was provided as pelleted (zero to 3 wk) and crumble (4 to 19 wk). Time eating was measured at 7, 11, and 19 weeks. A feeding rate test was performed after 11 weeks. Behavior was observed at 9 and 15 wk, by visual scan. At 6, 13, and 19 wk of age, one bird/pen was slaughtered for weighing different organs and analyzing the composition of empty whole bodies. Treatments did not affect BW uniformity; relative weights of the ovary, oviduct, or gizzard; or protein content of empty BW. Time eating varied with the growth curve at 19 wk (P < 0. 05), HBW pullets spent 19 more min eating than RBW pullets. DIL led to 4 and 8 more min eating at 19 wk for pullets of RBW and HBW (P < 0. 05), respectively. Pullets fed DIL consumed 30 % (P < 0. 05) less during the feeding rate test when kept on a restricted regimen, and they had lower compensatory energy intake after ad libitum feeding than those fed CON, indicating lower feeding motivation. Behavior was affected by the age {{and by the time}} of the d measured, but it did not change with the treatments. Birds spent most time pecking objects (50 %), feeding (28 %), and drinking (17 %).

The first experiment measured milk production, milk composition and N excretion of dairy cows fed pure lucerne (L), perennial ryegrass/white clover pasture (G) or a temporal sequence where lucerne was offered in the morning and perennial ryegrass-white clover pasture in the afternoon (GL). Three trials were conducted in early and mid-lactation (November and then January). Milksolid (MS) production was unaffected by pasture treatment in all three trials, averaging, 2. 31, 1. 90, and 1. 68 kg MS/cow/d for early lactation, mid lactation (November) and mid lactation (January) respectively. Although milk yield was higher in L than G during Mid-Nov lactation (22. 7 vs 20. 2 litres/cow/day respectively) this was offset by lower milk protein percentage in L (3. 67 % versus 4. 03 % for G) so that total milksolid production was similar across treatments. It was believed the lack of difference was due to similar estimated DM intake and diet metabolisable energy (ME) between L and G. Despite no differences in milk production, there was consistently higher urine N concentration and estimated urinary N output g/day in L (359 to 408 g/d) and GL (234 - 312 g/d) than G (146 to 263 g/d). The second experiment measured dry matter (DM) intake, diet composition, milk production and milk composition of cows in mid lactation (October) fed G and L at 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 kg DM/cow/d above ground level. Milk yield and milksolids production increased with herbage allowance in both G and L treatments but was unaffected by pasture treatment or by the interaction of pasture <b>treatment</b> and herbage <b>allowance.</b> The average marginal response (kg milk per extra kg DM eaten) was 0. 63 for L and 0. 56 for the G. The increase in milk production in both G and L <b>treatments</b> with herbage <b>allowance</b> was due to an increase in DM intake from low to high herbage allowances. Cows feeding on both L and G at the lowest herbage allowance (20 kg DM/cow/d) substituted lower DM intakes and low feed value by mobilising energy reserves which helped maintain milksolids production. Post grazing herbage mass increased with increasing herbage allowance as utilisation of above ground dry matter decreased from 81 - 42 % in L and 78 - 46 % in G. The third experiment measured apparent DM intake, diet composition, milk production and botanical composition in the re-growth from different herbage allowances in the second experiment. Cows were fed a constant herbage allowance of 30 kg DM/cow/d above ground level. Herbage allowance from the second experiment and subsequent post grazing herbage allowance had no effect on milksolids production in either L or G when grazed at a constant herbage allowance. The lack of an effect of previous post grazing herbage mass {{may be due to the}} differences in DM intake and diet quality being negligible between G and L, or that energy may have been partitioned away from milk production to liveweight gain. The fourth experiment measured seasonal and annual herbage DM production, herbage quality and botanical composition of G and L under irrigation. The total annual DM production was non-significant in L (18, 483 t DM/ha) and G (17, 626 t/DM/ha) under full irrigation. However, herbage growth rates in L were greater than in G from November- March averaging 18. 6 kg DM/ha/d more. The herbage quality of G was fairly consistent throughout the year (11. 8 to 12. 7 MJ ME/kg), while L quality declined considerably (12. 2 to 9. 2 MJ ME/kg DM) with an increase in herbage mass during times of peak growth in summer. The effect of incorporating lucerne into an irrigated dairy farm was modelled using FARMAX Dairy Pro. Data from experiment 1 to 4 was incorporated into the model and the effect of different proportions of lucerne on farm (0 to 50 %) and stocking rate (3. 6 to 4. 2 cows/ha) on profitability was modelled. The most profitable system at a $ 6. 50 /kg MS was 40 % lucerne on the milking platform. This system did not have the highest milk production per ha but the lowest cost per kg MS ($ 3. 6 /kg MS). Herbage production increased from 17. 3 t DM/ha at 0 % to 17. 6 t DM/ha at 50 % lucerne. The increased herbage production at 3. 6 cows/ha allowed more feed to be conserved over summer and used in spring and autumn. This resulted in less purchased feed required, decreasing cost per kg MS. Also contributing to the lower cost per kg MS in the high proportion lucerne systems was the lower N use which reduced from 259 kg/ha to 173 kg/ha. Results shown that despite there being no difference in diet quality or milk production between lucerne and perennial ryegrass-white clover, there could still be some advantages of using lucerne with greater diet selection and liveweight gain at certain herbage allowances. Lucerne could also have some advantages for increasing overall herbage production and shifting the growth curve to allow more feed to be conserved in summer, reducing purchased feed on the shoulders of the season and reducing costs per kg MS...|$|R
40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} on pregnant, non-lactating dairy cows to investigate the metabolisable energy (ME) requirements for maintenance and the efficiency with which ME is used for body weight (BW) gain. In the first experiment, 53 non-lactating, pregnant Holstein-Friesian × Jersey cross dairy cows were fed one of three allowances [low: 7. 5 kg,medium: 10. 1 kg, or high: 12. 4 kg of dry matter (DM) /day] of freshly cut autumn pasture for 38 ± 2 days (mean ± SD) in individual stalls to allow the measurement of estimated DM and ME intake daily. Animals were blocked by age (6 ± 2 years), day of gestation (208 ± 17 days), and BW (526 ± 55 kg). Cows on the low, medium, and high <b>allowance</b> <b>treatments</b> consumed 7. 5, 9. 4, and 10. 6 kg of DM/day, and BW gain, including the conceptus, was 0. 2, 0. 6, and 0. 9 kg/day. The ME content of pasture was estimated by wet chemistry from in vitro true digestibility and by near infrared spectroscopy. Total ME requirements for maintenance, pregnancy, and limited activity were 1. 07 MJ ME/kg of measured metabolic BW/day. This is more than 45 % higher than current recommendations. Differences {{may be due to}} an underestimation of ME requirements for maintenance or pregnancy, an overestimation of diet metabolisability, or a combination of these. Further research is necessary to determine the reasons for the greater ME requirements measured in the present study, but the results are important for on-farm decisions regarding feed allocation for nonlactating, pregnant dairy cows. In experiment 2, the amount of ME required for BW gain from pasture and commonly used supplementary feeds was investigated to estimate the efficiency with which ME is used for BW gain (kg). Control cows were offered autumn pasture to estimated maintenance requirements (- 0. 55 MJ ME/kg BW 0. 75), with an additional 20 MJ ME/d allocated for pregnancy and activity. All other cows received the same allowance of autumn pasture (Past) and an additional allowance (2. 5 or 5. 0 kg DM/day) of Past, spring pasture silage (Psil), maize silage (Msil), maize grain (Mgr), or palm kernel expeller (PKE). Regression analyses on BW allowed the determination of ME intake on BW gain for each feed; the kg was estimated from this, assuming each kg of BW contained 25 MJ of net energy. The kg of Past and Msil were 0. 34 and 0. 47, consistent with published literature and the kg of Psil (0. 50) was in line with published values for spring pasture. The greatest kg (0. 61) was for PKE, possibly due to its high fibre and fat content, and the fact that acetate and medium to long chained fatty acids are not substantially used for conceptus metabolism. The kg for Mgr was low (0. 38), possibly because the end products of digestion of starch (i. e. propionate and the hepatic-derived glucose) are used preferentially for conceptus metabolism and less for BW gain, or because the composition of BW gain differed relative to the other treatments. Results confirm differences between feeds in kg when pasture is the base diet, and provide important information for feed budgeting and ration formulation in grazing systems...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{increased}} interest in and increased usage of forages other than grass silage for feeding dairy cows during the winter period. This has arisen because of the inconsistency in making good quality grass silage and the low intake characteristics of this feed. The main objective of this project was to evaluate the effects on dairy cow intake and performance of offering fermented whole crop wheat (WCW) silage, urea-treated processed WCW and maize silage in mixtures with grass silage compared with grass silage alone. The value of these feeds as supplements to grazed grass in the Autumn for late lactation spring calving cows and their effect on dietary nitrogen (N) utilisation for milk protein production were also investigated. The first two experiments evaluated the effects of including 67 % of the forage mixture on a dry matter (DM) basis as fermented WCW, urea-treated processed WCW (also known as “Alkalage”) or maize silage in comparison to grass silage alone in the diet of autumn calving cows. The fermented WCW and urea-treated processed WCW were harvested at a stubble height of approximately 20 cm. Sixty and 95 % of the grain was milled/cracked in the urea-treated processed WCW in experiments 1 and 2, respectively. Forages were supplemented with concentrates of varying crude protein (CP) concentrations so as to maintain a similar CP concentration in the total dietary dry matter across treatments. In both experiments all the feeds were well preserved. The DM (g/kg) and starch contents (g/kg DM) in the fermented WCW, urea-treated processed WCW and maize silage in experiments 1 were 406 and 282, 733 and 324, 221 and 140 and in experiment 2 were 370 and 323, 763 and 341 and 302 and 324, respectively. Results from both experiments were similar. The three forage mixtures resulted in greater DM intake and greater fat plus protein production than grass silage. The largest effect on intake was obtained with the urea-treated processed WCW which probably reflected the greater DM content of this forage mixture compared with the others. Milk protein content was generally similar across the three forage mixtures and greater than on grass silage as the sole forage. In the third experiment short-straw urea-treated processed WCW (harvested at a stubble height of 35 cm) was evaluated {{in comparison to the}} fermented WCW (harvested at a stubble height of 20 cm), maize silage and grass silage. The DM (g/kg) and starch (g/kg DM) contents in the fermented WCW, urea-treated processed WCW and maize silage were 389 and 316, 795 and 382 and 346 and 301, respectively. Fifty nine percent of the grain was cracked/processed in the urea-treated processed UP-WCW. Level of inclusion of forages in the diets was the same as in the first two experiments and total dietary CP was again maintained at a similar concentration across treatments by offering concentrates of varying CP concentrations. The higher harvesting height of the urea-treated processed WCW resulted in a greater starch concentration in this feed in comparison to the first two experiments. The results however were very similar to those obtained in the first two experiments with the forage mixtures again increasing DM intake and fat plus protein yield. Inclusion of the short-straw urea-treated processed WCW did not result in greater fat plus protein production compared with the inclusion of fermented WCW or maize silage. The greatest efficiency of conversion of dietary nitrogen (N) to milk N was achieved with the maize silage mixture and the least efficiency with the urea-treated process WCW mixture. In experiment 4 the nutritive value of fermented WCW, urea-treated processed WCW and maize silage were evaluated in comparison to a concentrate as supplements to grazed grass for spring calving cows in the autumn. A treatment with a high grass allowance of 24 kgDM (> 4 cm) /cow per day was also included while the grass allowance on the supplemented treatments was restricted to 17 kgDM (> 4 cm) /cow per day. All the supplemented treatments and the high grass <b>allowance</b> <b>treatment</b> gave greater milk yields than the unsupplemented restricted grass treatment. The concentrate supplement resulted in the greatest solids corrected milk yield and this was greater than any of the forage supplemented treatments which were not significantly different from one another. In the final experiment the output of N in milk, urine and faeces was measured when grass silage, fermented WCW, urea-treated processed WCW and maize silage were fed as the sole forages plus 6 kg of a concentrate containing 338 g crude protein/kg DM. The proportion of consumed N excreted in urine and faeces was greatest on grass silage and urea-treated processed WCW with fermented WCW and maize silage resulting in the greatest proportion of consumed N being excreted in milk. Overall, the project demonstrated that including either type of WCW or maize silage with grass silage increased fat plus protein production and protein concentration to a similar extent compared to grass silage as the sole forage. All three forages increased DM intake with the greatest increase observed with urea-treated processed WCW. Because of this greater intake resulting in similar fat plus protein production conversion of dietary DM to milk solids was less efficient on urea-treated processed WCW based diets than on fermented WCW or maize silage based diets. Grass silage and urea-treated processed WCW based diets were least N efficient with less dietary N being incorporated into milk N than on fermented WCW or maize silage based diets. Comparing the responses on the forage mixtures relative to one another and to grass silage across experiments 1 to 3 indicates that neither degree of grain processing or harvesting height (within the ranges studied here) are of substantial importance in determining the nutritive value of urea-treated processed WCW. All of the three alternative forages gave similar solids corrected milk yield responses when used as buffer feeds for spring calved cows at pasture in the autumn but these responses were less than 50 % of the response to a concentrate supplement.
