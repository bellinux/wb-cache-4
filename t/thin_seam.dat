60|$|They {{set to work}} again, {{packing the}} hay into corners and {{stamping}} it down, and his occupation reminded Frank {{of what he had}} heard about mining in a <b>thin</b> <b>seam</b> of coal. It seemed hotter than ever, the dust was choking, and at every incautious move he bumped his head or shoulders against the beams. The last sled arrived before they were ready for it, and they crawled about half buried, dragging the grass here and there with their hands and ramming it with their feet and knees into any odd spaces left. At length the work was finished, and wriggling toward the opening in the wall, Harry caught at the edge of it and finding a foothold on a log beneath boldly leaped down. Frank was, however, less fortunate when he followed his companion, for some of the hay slipped away beneath him, and, without the least intention of leaving the barn in that undignified fashion, he suddenly shot out through the hole. He felt the air rush past him, and then, somewhat to his astonishment, found himself on the ground, none the worse except for the jar of the fall.|$|E
60|$|The jarring and {{rattling}} ceased as suddenly, but {{the house}} seemed silent and empty. She moved to the door, which had now swung open a few inches, but to her astonishment it was fixed in that position, {{and she could not}} pass. As yet she had been free from any personal fear, and even now it was with a half smile at her imprisonment in the major's study, that she rang the bell and turned to the window. A man, whom she {{recognized as one of the}} ranch laborers, was standing a hundred feet away in the garden, looking curiously at the house. He saw her face as she tried to raise the sash, uttered an exclamation, and ran forward. But before she could understand what he said, the sash began to rattle in her hand, the jarring recommenced, the floor shook beneath her feet, a hideous sound of grinding seemed to come from the walls, a <b>thin</b> <b>seam</b> of dust-like smoke broke from the ceiling, and with the noise of falling plaster a dozen books followed each other from the shelves, in what in the frantic hurry of that moment seemed a grimly deliberate succession; a picture hanging against the wall, to her dazed wonder, swung forward, and appeared to stand at right angles from it; she felt herself reeling against the furniture; a deadly nausea overtook her; as she glanced despairingly towards the window, the outlying fields beyond the garden seemed to be undulating like a sea. For the first time she raised her voice, not in fear, but in a pathetic little cry of apology for her awkwardness in tumbling about and not being able to grapple this new experience, and then she found herself near the door, which had once more swung free. She grasped it eagerly, and darted out of the study into the deserted passage. Here some instinct made her follow the line of the wall, rather than the shaking balusters of the corridor and staircase, but before she reached the bottom she heard a shout, and the farm laborer she had seen coming towards her seized her by the arm, dragged her to the open doorway of the drawing-room, and halted beneath its arch in the wall. Another thrill, but lighter than before, passed through the building, then all was still again.|$|E
30|$|Coal mined from <b>thin</b> <b>seams</b> with {{thicknesses}} of 1.3  m or less {{accounts for}} approximately 20  % of Chinese total coal reserve. <b>Thin</b> <b>seams</b> occur {{in more than}} 85  % of the Chinese coal mines. Safe and efficient methods for the mining of <b>thin</b> <b>seams</b> have historically presented technical challenges for the coal industry. Confined spaces, substandard working conditions, high labor intensity, high heading rate, and complex field management have hampered improvements in thin-seam mining technology. These limitations {{have resulted in a}} lack of mechanization, low standards in work efficiency, high safety risk, and poor economic performance (Mao et al. 2011; Ning 2013).|$|R

60|$|The {{flanks of}} Green Mountain and the {{surrounding}} country are covered by a great mass, some hundred feet in thickness, of loose fragments. The lower beds generally consist of fine-grained, slightly consolidated tuffs (Some of this peperino, or tuff, is sufficiently {{hard not to be}} broken by the greatest force of the fingers.), and the upper beds of great loose fragments, with alternating finer beds. (On the northern side of the Green Mountain a <b>thin</b> <b>seam,</b> about an inch in thickness, of compact oxide of iron, extends over a considerable area; it lies conformably in {{the lower part of the}} stratified mass of ashes and fragments. This substance is of a reddish- brown colour, with an almost metallic lustre; it is not magnetic, but becomes so after having been heated under the blowpipe, by which it is blackened and partly fused. This seam of compact stone, by intercepting the little rain-water which falls on the island, gives rise to a small dripping spring, first discovered by Dampier. It is the only fresh water on the island, so that the possibility of its being inhabited has entirely depended on the occurrence of this ferruginous layer.) One white ribbon- like layer of decomposed, pumiceous breccia, was curiously bent into deep unbroken curves, beneath each of the large fragments in the superincumbent stratum. From the relative position of these beds, I presume that a narrow- mouthed crater, standing nearly in the position of Green Mountain, like a great air-gun, shot forth, before its final extinction, this vast accumulation of loose matter. Subsequently to this event, considerable dislocations have taken place, and an oval circus has been formed by subsidence. This sunken space lies at the north-eastern foot of Green Mountain, and is well represented in Map 2. Its longer axis, which is connected with a N.E. and S.W. line of fissure, is three-fifths of a nautical mile in length; its sides are nearly perpendicular, except in one spot, and about four hundred feet in height; they consist, in the lower part, of a pale basalt with feldspar, and in the upper part, of the tuff and loose ejected fragments; the bottom is smooth and level, and under almost any other climate a deep lake would have been formed here. From the thickness of the bed of loose fragments, with which the surrounding country is covered, the amount of aeriform matter necessary for their projection must have been enormous; hence we may suppose it probable that after the explosions vast subterranean caverns were left, and that the falling in of the roof of one of these produced the hollow here described. At the Galapagos Archipelago, pits of a similar character, but of a much smaller size, frequently occur at the bases of small cones of eruption.|$|E

40|$|Backfill mining is an {{effective}} way to control ground subsidence and govern gangue. To solve the problem of thin coal seam mining under villages, a new <b>thin</b> <b>seam</b> backfill mining technology was proposed. This paper investigated a reasonable proportion of filling materials by experiments, designed the filling system and introduced key technologies for <b>thin</b> <b>seam</b> working face filling. Finally, an industrial test of <b>thin</b> <b>seam</b> backfill mining technology was carried out in the C 1661 working face, Beixu Coal Mine. The results show that the developed filling material meets both the pumping liquidity and strength requirements of the filling body during the early and late stages.

By using the key technologies for <b>thin</b> <b>seam</b> working face filling, the time needed for working face filling, the connection and disconnection of the filling pipeline and gob-side entry retaining were all greatly shortened. The labor intensity of the workers was reduced, and the mechanization level of the mine was improved. A fill mining length of 480 m was successfully completed. With effective roof subsidence control, the ground subsidence can be reduced, and good results can be achieved.

40|$|The {{poor coal}} loading {{performance}} of a shearer drum primarily restricts the widespread application of the shearer and affects the mining efficiency in <b>thin</b> <b>seam</b> mining. The coal loading performance of the shearer drum is influenced by several factors, such as geographical environment, drum structural parameters, and motion parameters.
