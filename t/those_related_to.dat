5|$|One of the {{historically}} contentious views within Jainism {{is in part}} attributed to Mahavira and his ascetic life where he never wore any clothes as a mark of disowning everything (interpreted {{as a consequence of}} the fifth vow of Aparigraha).

5|$|The {{hereditary}} {{titles of}} the hierarchic nobility recorded {{during the reign}} of the first Sassanid monarch Ardashir I most likely reflect the titles already in use during the Parthian era.

5|$|Kwee {{began his}} writing career in 1919 with the stage play Allah jang Palsoe. During the 1920s, he wrote several novels and stage plays while also {{working as a}} journalist, first for Sin Po then for Sin Bin.

After 1930 Kwee began to focus predominantly on religious texts, particularly <b>those</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> Buddhism, Confucianism, and Chinese folk religion, but also relating to Islam. A fluent English speaker, Kwee adapted several of his writings– both fiction and non-fiction– from publications outside the Dutch East Indies. His last work before his death, seven volumes related to various aspects of Confucianism, was published in 1950.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1969, Biden ran as a Democrat for the New Castle County Council on {{a liberal}} {{platform}} that included support for public {{housing in the}} suburban area. He won by a solid, two-thousand vote margin in the usually Republican district and in a bad year for Democrats in the state. Even before taking his seat, he was already talking about running for the U.S. Senate {{in a couple of}} years. He served on the County Council from 1970 to 1972 while continuing his private law practice. Among issues he addressed on the council was his opposition to large highway projects that might disrupt Wilmington neighborhoods, including <b>those</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> Interstate 95.|$|E
5|$|Modi also relaxed or {{abolished}} {{a number}} of other environmental regulations, particularly <b>those</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> industrial activity. A government committee stated that the existing system only served to create corruption, and that the government should instead rely on the owners of industries to voluntarily inform the government about the pollution they were creating. Other changes included reducing ministry oversight on small mining projects, and no longer requiring approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas. In addition, Modi lifted a moratorium on new industrial activity in the most polluted areas in the countries. The changes were welcomed by businesspeople, but criticised by environmentalists.|$|E

The relay was intended to draw attention to a range of human rights issues in China in connection with the Olympics, especially <b>those</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> Falun Gong and Tibet, and received support from hundreds of elected officials, past Olympic medallists, human rights groups and other concerned organizations.|$|E
5|$|In the Junta, Alberti {{was aligned}} {{with most of}} the reformist {{proposals}} of Mariano Moreno, as well as Juan Larrea and Juan José Castelli. He signed most of the rulings that shaped the new political system, such as <b>those</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> popular sovereignty, representative and republican principles, separation of powers, publicity of the government actions, freedom of speech and the bases of political federalism. However, he did not support the actions of the Junta that contradicted his religious formation, regardless of the context. He refused to sign the death penalty for Santiago de Liniers, captured after the defeat of his counter-revolution. He signed the harsh commands given to Castelli for the first Upper Peru campaign, but noticing next to his signature that he made an exception with the articles involving capital punishment. He was also concerned by the role of the church in the new political system and headed a dispute against the Cabildo about it. He considered that the Cabildo should not have any authority over the Junta in ecclesiastic topics, to prevent the former abuses of the absolutist governments.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} {{created the}} game using 96K of memory, which limited the file size of individual graphics and sound effects they could use. The memory limits also prohibited Newcomer from creating more characters. The graphics were created at the pixel level and hand-animated. To animate the birds, Hendricks used Eadweard Muybridge's book Animals In Motion as a reference. Given the limited memory, {{she had to}} balance the number of frames to minimize file size, while maintaining realistic animation. Hendricks originally picked gray for the buzzards, but chose green instead to optimize the color palette as the developers had only 16colors to create the visuals. Once the colors were decided for the character sprites, Newcomer finalized {{the look of the}} platforms. The hardware had limited audio capabilities, and sounds typically required larger amounts of memory than graphics. Working with these restrictions, Newcomer instructed Murphy and Kotlarik to focus on select sounds he deemed important to reinforcing gameplay. He reasoned that the audio would serve as conspicuous hints that players could use to adjust their strategy. Though Newcomer prioritized the wing flap, other sound effects like <b>those</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the pterodactyl, collisions, and hatching eggs were considered important as well.|$|E

Nevertheless, Bessie, who had been appalled by the housing conditions in the ward, helped to instigate a slum clearance campaign which slowly brought improvements. As {{a member of the}} council's Port Sanitary and Hospitals Committee, which controlled all the city's hospitals and residential homes for the elderly, Bessie discovered that the hospitals were generally verminous, drably decorated and poorly ventilated, with inadequate cooking facilities. Patients' record-keeping systems were rudimentary, with little or no communication between hospitals. She became involved in the reform, reorganisation and modernisation of many of the city's health facilities, particularly <b>those</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> mothers and children. From 1934 she was chairman of the Maternity and Child Welfare subcommittee, and in June 1936 worked with other women's groups to organise a national conference on maternity and child welfare issues.|$|E
