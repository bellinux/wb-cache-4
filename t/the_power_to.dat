Her yantra (sacred geometric diagram), whether physically constructed or mentally envisioned, is used in worship along with the mantra. Offering certain items to a fire sacrifice—particularly those performed at cremation grounds, river banks, forests, or crossroads—while repeating the mantra is said to fulfil specific goals. An offering of Bael leaves is said to result in kingship; salt gives <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> control; turmeric gives <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> paralyse; neem twigs bring wealth; and an offering of sandalwood, camphor and saffron together or a salt and honey mixture grants <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> attract people.

5|$|An {{amendment}} to the Articles had been proposed by Thomas Burke, in February 1781, to give Congress <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> collect a 5% impost, or duty on all imports, but this required ratification by all states; securing its passage as law proved impossible after it was rejected by Rhode Island in November 1782. Madison joined Hamilton in persuading Congress to send a delegation to persuade Rhode Island to change its mind. Their report recommending the delegation argued the federal government needed not just some level of financial autonomy, but also {{the ability to make}} laws that superseded those of the individual states. Hamilton transmitted a letter arguing that Congress already had <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> tax, since it had <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> fix the sums due from the several states; but Virginia's rescission of its own ratification ended the Rhode Island negotiations.|$|E
