An army of 90,000 soldiers and another of 60,000 were defeated by Jin forces by June. A second expedition to rescue Taiyuan was also unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Fort Corcoran was a wood-and-earthwork {{fortification}} {{constructed by}} the Union Army in northern Virginia as part of <b>the</b> <b>defenses</b> of Washington, D.C. during the American Civil War. Built in 1861, shortly after the occupation of Arlington, Virginia by Union forces, it protected {{the southern end of}} the Aqueduct Bridge and overlooked the Potomac River and Theodore Roosevelt Island, known as Mason's Island.|$|E

In response, on September 12, 1972, <b>the</b> <b>Defense</b> Supply Agency (now known as <b>the</b> <b>Defense</b> Logistics Agency) established <b>the</b> <b>Defense</b> Property Disposal Service (renamed <b>the</b> <b>Defense</b> Reutilization and Marketing Service in 1985) in Battle Creek, Michigan, as a primary-level field activity.

5|$|Grant planned another assault for May 22, {{but this}} time with greater care; they would first reconnoiter {{thoroughly}} and soften up <b>the</b> <b>defenses</b> with artillery and naval gunfire. The lead units were supplied with ladders to ascend the fortification walls. Grant did not want a long siege, and this attack was to be by the entire army across a wide front.|$|E
5|$|In {{combination}} with the ‘Ly Thuong Kiet Military Plan’ and experiences gained during the North Vietnamese Nguyễn Huệ Offensive, Lieutenant General Ngô Quang Trưởng organised <b>the</b> <b>defenses</b> of I Corps into three phases, to be staged from three different areas.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{remained}} in New York City until March, when the Continental Congress {{sent him to}} South Carolina; the defenses' construction was left to General William Alexander (Lord Stirling). Troops were in limited supply, so Washington found <b>the</b> <b>defenses</b> incomplete, but Lee had concluded {{that it would be}} impossible to hold the city with the British commanding the sea. He reasoned that <b>the</b> <b>defenses</b> should be located with the ability to inflict heavy casualties upon the British if any move was made to take and hold ground. Barricades and redoubts were established in and around the city, and the bastion of Fort Stirling across the East River in Brooklyn Heights, facing the city. Lee also saw that the immediate area was cleared of Loyalists.|$|E

5|$|Montcalm, wary of a British counterattack, and {{concerned}} about the fatigue of his troops {{after a long day}} of battle, had barrels of beer and wine brought forward to the lines. The troops spent the night alternating between sleeping and working on <b>the</b> <b>defenses</b> in anticipation of a renewed attack.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} third repulse of the Confederates on the western wing, the 2nd Kentucky and 9th Tennessee regiments arrived from the Mauckport Road and joined the battle, giving the attackers a {{numerical}} superiority. At about 12:40p.m., Capt. Byrnes arrived with the Confederate artillery and used his two ten-pound Parrott rifle cannons to pin down the defenders in the works. In the meantime, Morgan was leading his main body of troops far around {{the eastern edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>defenses</b> and up the Plank Road, threatening the town directly and bypassing <b>the</b> <b>defenses</b> entirely. As they moved onto the Corydon Pike, they shot and robbed a toll gate keeper who refused to throw down his gun.|$|E
5|$|The {{actions of}} both commanders have been {{extensively}} analyzed in this action. While Montcalm performed well during the battle, some tactical options escaped his notice, {{and some of}} his actions in preparing <b>the</b> <b>defenses</b> at Carillon are open to question. In contrast, almost everything Abercrombie did has been questioned. It is widely held among historians that he was an incompetent commander.|$|E
50|$|On December 31, 2006, <b>the</b> <b>Defense</b> {{minister}} and his army confronted two opposing militias who were disputing {{the control of}} a vehicle left behind.

5000|$|The key phrase <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> {{focused upon}} was [...] "house {{used as a}} place of gaming."

5|$|After the {{surrender}} of General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, {{the primary reason for}} manned defenses protecting Washington ceased to exist. Initial recommendations by Col. Alexander, chief engineer of the Washington defenses, were to divide <b>the</b> <b>defenses</b> into three classes: those that should be kept active (first-class), those that should be mothballed and kept in a reserve state (second-class), and those that should be abandoned entirely (third-class).

Due to its rear-area nature and the fact that inspections were no longer needed to protect the Long Bridge against sabotage, Fort Jackson fell into the third-class category.|$|E

5|$|As {{was common}} for many senior {{officers}} {{at the end of}} the war, Alexander was honored with a brevet rank of brigadier general in the regular army, effective March 13, 1865. Following his closure of the offices of <b>the</b> <b>defenses</b> of Washington, D.C., he was briefly ordered to New England, where he supervised the renovation of various minor fortifications and river improvements in Maine. That posting came to an end on January 7, 1867, when he was ordered to the West Coast as the chief U.S. Army engineer in the region. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on March 7, 1867.|$|E
5|$|Beauregard {{continued}} commanding <b>the</b> <b>defenses</b> of Petersburg in {{the early}} days of the siege, but with the loss of the Weldon Railroad in the Battle of Globe Tavern (August 18–21), he was criticized for not attacking more forcefully and he became dissatisfied with the command arrangements under Lee. He hoped for an independent command, but his desires were thwarted in two instances: Lee chose Lt. Gen. Jubal Early to lead an expedition north through the Shenandoah Valley and threaten Washington, and Davis chose Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood to replace the faltering Joseph E. Johnston in the Atlanta Campaign.|$|E

5|$|Caliph Abu Bakr died in Madinah, making Umar his successor. Umar removed Khalid from {{command of}} the Muslim army and {{appointed}} Abu Ubaidah as the new commander in chief. In later years, following the Battle of Yarmuk, the Rashidun Caliphate annexed the whole Levant, followed by the conquest of Antioch in 638. By 639, the Byzantines had lost Armenia and Mesopotamia. Emperor Heraclius concentrated on <b>the</b> <b>defenses</b> of Egypt and Anatolia, creating a buffer-zone in Anatolia west of Caesarea by abandoning all the Byzantine fortifications there. The Muslims never invaded Anatolia. However, by 642 the Byzantines lost Egypt and Tripolitania to the Caliphate.|$|E
