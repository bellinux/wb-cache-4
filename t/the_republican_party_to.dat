5|$|Historians {{have since}} {{connected}} {{the success of}} Save Our Children with the organization of conservative Christian participation in political processes. Although forceful Christian involvement had not taken a widespread role in politics in the United States since 1925, within two years the Reverend Jerry Falwell developed a coalition of conservative religious groups named the Moral Majority that influenced <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> incorporate a social agenda in national politics. Homosexuality, the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), abortion, and pornography were among the issues most central to the Moral Majority's priorities until it folded in 1989. For many gay people, the surprise at the outcome of all the campaigns in 1977 and 1978 instilled a new determination and consolidated activism and communities in many cities where the gay community had not been politically active.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Borah joined many Idahoans, {{including}} Senator Fred Dubois, in bolting <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> {{support the}} presidential campaign of Democrat William Jennings Bryan — free silver, which Bryan advocated, was extremely popular in Idaho. Borah thus became a Silver Republican {{in opposition to the}} campaign of the Republican presidential candidate, former Ohio governor William McKinley. Borah ran for the House of Representatives that year, but knew that with the silver vote split between himself and a Democrat-Populist fusion candidate, he had little chance of winning, and concentrated on making speeches aimed at gaining a legislature that would re-elect Dubois — until 1913, state legislatures elected senators. Bryan, Dubois, and Borah were all defeated.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{purchasing}} the Star, Harding {{turned his attention}} to politics, supporting Foraker in his first successful bid for governor in 1885. Foraker was part of the war generation that challenged older Ohio Republicans, such as Senator John Sherman, for control of state politics. Harding, always a party loyalist, supported Foraker in the complex internecine warfare that was Ohio Republican politics. Harding was willing to tolerate Democrats, as necessary to a two-party system, but had only contempt for those who bolted <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> join third-party movements. He was a delegate to the Republican state convention in 1888, at the age of 22, representing Marion County, and would be elected a delegate in most years until becoming president.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Independent <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> (Partido Republicano Independiente) was a {{political}} party in Cuba, led by Juan Gualberto Gómez. It was formed around 1900, after splits in <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>parties</b> in Havana, Matanzas and Las Villas. The split {{was caused by the}} opposition of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> Gualberto Gómez's radical position against the Platt Amendment. <b>The</b> Independent <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> supported Gualberto Gómez's position on the issue.|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} two {{decades of the twentieth}} century the Indiana Anti-Saloon League (IASL), formed in 1898 as a state {{auxiliary}} of the national Anti-Saloon League, and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union successfully organized pressure on Indiana politicians, especially members of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>party,</b> <b>to</b> support the dry cause. The IASL, although not the first organization to take up the dry crusade in Indiana, became a key force behind efforts at attaining passage of statewide prohibition in early 1917, and rallied state support for ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1919. The IASL's success, under the leadership of Edward S. Shumaker, an ordained Methodist minister, made it a model for the League's other state organizations. Shumaker made clear to politicians he did not care whether they drank, but insisted they vote for dry laws or face defeated in the next election by dry voters.|$|E

Eleven of Rockefeller vetoes were overridden, far more than for other Arkansas governors in a four-year period. The fate of Rockefeller programs rested with the Democratic legislators, one of whom, Arkansas House Speaker Sterling R.

25|$|In September 1956, the Awami League {{formed a}} {{coalition}} with <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> secure {{a majority in}} the new National Assembly of Pakistan and took over the central government. Awami League President Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy became the Prime Minister of Pakistan. Suhrawardy pursued a reform agenda to reduce the long-standing economic disparity between East and West Pakistan, greater representation of Bengalis in the Pakistani civil and armed services and he unsuccessfully attempted to alleviate the food shortage in the country.|$|E
25|$|Until 1964, Georgia's state {{government}} had the longest unbroken record of single-party dominance, by the Democratic Party, {{of any state}} in the Union. This record was established {{largely due to the}} disenfranchisement of most blacks and many poor whites by the state in its constitution and laws in the early 20th century. Some elements, such as requiring payment of poll taxes and passing literacy tests, prevented blacks from registering to vote; their exclusion from the political system lasted into the 1960s and reduced <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> a non-competitive status in the early 20th century.|$|E

25|$|George W. Bush, son of George H. W. Bush, won the 2000 Republican presidential {{nomination}} over Arizona Senator John McCain, former Senator Elizabeth Dole and others. With his highly controversial and exceedingly narrow {{victory in the}} 2000 election against the Vice President Al Gore, the Republican Party gained control of the Presidency and both houses of Congress {{for the first time}} since 1952. However, it lost control of the Senate when Vermont Senator James Jeffords left <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> become an independent in 2001 and caucused with the Democrats.|$|E
25|$|Mount {{had been}} {{approached}} {{several times to}} run for public office by <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party,</b> <b>to</b> which he belonged, but had always refused. In 1888 he was nominated {{to run for the}} Indiana State Senate, despite his protests. The party at that time was losing farming votes to the Populist Party, and bringing farmers to the ticket was seen as a way to reverse the trend. He reluctantly accepted the nomination expecting to lose, but won the election in an ordinarily Democratic-controlled district. In the Democratic-controlled Senate he submitted no legislation of his own, but did support several measures he believed would benefit the farming community, including increasing funding for state agricultural programs.|$|E

Grant and the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge. He also compiled a large collection of letters and telegrams sent by various influential members of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> Stephen W. Dorsey and provided digests for the memoirs of Grant and Beecher in his column, which were reprinted throughout the world, and regularly corresponded with the Boston Globe, the Chicago News and the United Press.

25|$|DeLay's {{involvement}} with the lobbying industry included a pointed {{effort on the part}} of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> parlay the Congressional majority into dominance of K Street, the lobbying district of Washington, D.C. DeLay, Senator Rick Santorum, and Grover Norquist launched a campaign in 1995 encouraging lobbying firms to retain only Republican officials in top positions. Firms that had Democrats in positions of authority, DeLay suggested, would not be granted the ear of majority party members. In 1999, DeLay was privately reprimanded by the House Ethics Committee after he pulled an intellectual property rights bill off the House floor when the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) hired a former Democratic Congressman, Dave McCurdy. Firms initially responded to the campaign, but it waned during 2004, when the possibility of Senator John Kerry's winning the presidency gave lobbying firms some incentive to hire Democrats.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, the Awami League {{formed an}} {{alliance}} with <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> lead a coalition government in Pakistan. Suhrawardy became prime minister and pledged to resolve the energy crises, address economic disparities between East and West Pakistan, and strengthen the armed forces. His initiatives included supply side economic policies, planning nuclear power and energy and reorganizing and reforming the Pakistani military. In foreign policy, he pioneered a strategic partnership with the United States. Faced with pressure from the bureaucracy and business community over his policies in aid distribution, nationalization and opposition to the one unit scheme, {{he was forced to}} resign on 10 October 1957, under threat of dismissal by President Iskandar Mirza. He was banned from public life by the military junta of General Ayub Khan. Suhrawardy died in 1963 in Beirut, Lebanon after suffering a massive heart attack.|$|E
