60|$|Challenger sprang {{into the}} air bellowing like a bull, and tore frantically at his coat and shirt to get them off. Summerlee and I laughed {{so that we could}} hardly help him. At last we exposed that monstrous torso (fifty-four inches, by the <b>tailor's</b> <b>tape).</b> His body was all matted with black hair, out of which jungle we picked the {{wandering}} tick before it had bitten him. But the bushes round were full of the horrible pests, and it was clear that we must shift our camp.|$|R
40|$|Two-component powder {{injection}} moulding is a promising technology for producing multifunctional components. The right choice of partner materials is essential {{since they have}} to match chemically, thermally, and technologically to assure good bonding. However, all requirements are rarely met at the same time. ZTA (zirconia toughened alumina) and ATZ (alumina toughened zirconia) are an interesting combination due to their high hardness and toughness, respectively. Despite of very good chemical compatibility, they differ in thermal expansion which introduces stresses during sintering and leads to failure. We present a method using ceramic tapes to create {{a bridge between the}} two feedstocks by generating a CTE-gradient. The <b>tailored</b> <b>tapes</b> consist of alumina-zirconia mixtures and are ap plied during the shaping process by inmould labelling. The compound is formed after codebinding by co-sintering...|$|R
50|$|A {{flexible}} {{length measuring}} instrument {{which is not}} necessarily straight in use is the <b>tailor's</b> fabric <b>tape</b> measure, a length of tape calibrated in inches and centimeters. It is used to measure around a solid body, e.g., a person's waist measurement, as well as linear measurement, e.g., inside leg. It is rolled up when not in use, taking up little space.|$|R
2500|$|Schwarzenegger's {{official}} {{height of}} 6'2" [...] (1.88m) {{has been brought}} into question by several articles. In his bodybuilding days in the late 1960s, he {{was measured to be}} 6'1.5" [...] (1.87m), a height confirmed by his fellow bodybuilders. However, in 1988 both the Daily Mail and Time Out magazine mentioned that Schwarzenegger appeared noticeably shorter. Prior to running for governor, Schwarzenegger's height was once again questioned in an article by the Chicago Reader. As governor, Schwarzenegger engaged in a light-hearted exchange with Assemblyman Herb Wesson over their heights. At one point, Wesson made an unsuccessful attempt to, in his own words, [...] "settle this once and for all and find out how tall he is" [...] by using a <b>tailor's</b> <b>tape</b> measure on the Governor. Schwarzenegger retaliated by placing a pillow stitched with the words [...] "Need a lift?" [...] on the five-foot-five inch (165cm) Wesson's chair before a negotiating session in his office. Bob Mulholland also claimed Schwarzenegger was 5'10" [...] (1.78m) and that he wore risers in his boots. In 1999, Men's Health magazine stated his height was 5'10".|$|R

40|$|A {{problem for}} many {{fisheries}} managers {{is trying to}} maintain a diverse prey base while maximizing predator size. To test the effects of water depth and impoundment isolation on fish size and species composition, two rock-quarry ponds were sampled at the Great Ape Trust in central Iowa during the fall of 2005. One impoundment was shallow and small compared to an adjacent impoundment that was relatively deep and large. The impoundments were isolated from one another {{for the majority of}} the year by an extremely shallow, narrow band of water that was subject to lateral transfer from the Des Moines River. We hypothesized that fish of each species will be greater in the larger, deeper pond. Specimens were collected using a throw net, lengths were recorded with a <b>tailors</b> <b>tape,</b> and capture locations were marked using GPS. Two-tailed t-tests were then used to analyze data sets that were standardized using log transformations to assume for normality. Although species composition was found to be identical in both impoundments, significant differences in mean length were only found in two of the five species, bluegill and the common carp. We conclude that factors other than pond depth play a greater role in influencing body size such as dissolved oxygen content and inter- and intra-specific competition...|$|R
40|$|Development {{programs}} recommend fattening of pigs aged between 1 and 2 {{years by}} supplementing their local diet with industrial cereal bran, to improve womens' income. At the best moment {{to start this}} activity, just after the rainy season, high demand for these pigs induced higher prices and low margins. The start after the rainy season does not fit in the existing production system as farmers sell their surplus pigs {{before and during the}} rainy season. Traditional pig fattening lasts 3 years. About 60 women in 8 villages tested early fattening of young piglets. Piglets of the treatment were supplemented with a special concentrate and showed higher daily weight gains compared to the traditionally fed group. The gross margin of the early fattening was equal to the recommended pig fattening, but the first solved problems related to availability of piglets and thus fits better in the existing production system. Almost half of the early fattened pigs were sold within a year. Most of the women appreciated the experiment positively and suggested positive margins can be attained by selecting suitable piglets and rigorously respecting feeding and management schemes. Criteria were developed for selecting the most suitable piglets with a simple <b>tailor</b> <b>tape.</b> A projection on 3 years shows that the gross margin of early fattening is higher compared to traditional fattening and that it facilitates the production of more meat against lower cost...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the Morphometric Trait Characteristics of West African Dwarf (WAD) Goats in five Local Government Areas of Abia State. A total of One Hundred & Twenty Three (123) WAD goats (33 bucks and 90 does) were randomly sampled from local farmers in the area (Umuahia – South, Isiala –Ngwa North, Ikwuano, Isuikwuato and Ukwa East LGAs). The study lasted two consecutive months and the experimental animals were raised semi- intensively and fed with fresh green forages and kitchen wastes. Drinking water was provided ad libitum. Goats {{between the ages of}} less than a year and four years were used based on their dentition. The body weight and linear body measurements were determined using a hanging scale and <b>tailor’s</b> <b>tape</b> respectively. The following linear body measurements (LBMs) were taken: Withers Height (WH), Rump Height (RH), Rump Width (RW), and Body Length (BL). Others include Heart Girth (HG), Neck Circumference (NC), Face Length (FL), Neck Length (NL), Ear Length (EL) and Foreleg Length (FLL). Results obtained showed that BWT, RH and HG of WAD goats were significantly (p 0. 05) influenced on all morphometric traits studied. In all parameters studied, Does were superior to Bucks. Based on this study, it is established that Morphometric characteristics of WAD goats are affected by age and sex of the animals...|$|R
50|$|In his paintings, {{prints and}} {{drawings}} Louis Kahan explored many interests and themes, including dreams, death, {{and his own}} life. Childhood games, portraits and nudes were ongoing subjects.Symbolism particularly characterises his later works. Later, dreamlike prints and paintings often show Kahan's tools of the trade: palette, brushes, <b>tailor's</b> scissors and <b>tape.</b> These represent a kind of metaphorical self-portrait and life history.|$|R
5000|$|A mixtape (also mix-tape or mix tape) is a home-made {{compilation}} of music (typically copyrighted songs taken from other sources) recorded {{in a specific}} order, traditionally onto a cassette tape, though later replaced by CD or digital playlist formats. The songs can be sequential, or made into a continuous program by beatmatching the songs and creating seamless transitions at their beginnings and endings by use of fades or abrupt edits. Compilations may include a selection of favorite songs, or music linked by theme or mood, perhaps <b>tailored</b> to the <b>tape's</b> intended recipient.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve {{aerodynamic}} performance, a twist criterion was used to design the canard and wing lifting surfaces of two graphite-epoxy research aircraft. To meet that twist criterion, the lifting surfaces were <b>tailored</b> using graphite-epoxy <b>tape.</b> The outer surface of the aircraft is essentially constructed of 95 percent graphite epoxy materials. The analytical tools and methodology used to design those lifting surfaces are described. One aircraft was subjected to an 8 g ground test in order to verify structural integrity and to determine how well the desired twist was achieved. Test results are presented and the reductions of both flight and ground strain test gages and their associated stresses are discussed...|$|R
