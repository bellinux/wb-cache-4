James Montgomery of MTV News wrote that Knowles' vocals, which he called, [...] "icy and cool, slippery like mercury [...] nothing <b>to</b> <b>scoff</b> at either", help make the song an [...] "undeniable smash" [...] that is unique compared to the work of other artists. Jennifer Vineyard of the same publication argued that the rock elements and smooth vocals contribute to Knowles' [...] "fierce" [...] alter ego, who [...] "dares the listener to dream of her, warning that it might be a 'beautiful nightmare'." [...] Arielle Castillo of Miami New Times noted that [...] "Sweet Dreams" [...] is another one of Jim Jonsin's productions with a keyboard-propelled arrangement, but unlike the material Jonsin crafted for Soulja Boy, the song is [...] "swirling, and darker". Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle and Gary Trust of Billboard magazine agreed that the song is one of Knowles' purest dance songs and is [...] "an irresistible call to the dance floor". Describing [...] "Sweet Dreams" [...] as a [...] "cool dance track", Dennis Amith of J!-ENT complimented its arrangement, calling it [...] "experimental" [...] with [...] "cool transitions".|$|E
500|$|Borscht's westward {{expansion}} {{was less}} successful; Germans used <b>to</b> <b>scoff</b> at the soup {{along with other}} East European fare. What helped familiarize Western Europe with borscht was the practice of Russian emperors, as well as Russian and Polish aristocrats, to employ celebrated French chefs, who later presented their own versions of the dish as a foreign curiosity back in France. One of the first French chefs to do so was , who worked briefly for Emperor Alexander I in 1819. In his take on borscht, the original Russian soup served only as inspiration for an extravagant [...] dish {{with an air of}} eastern exoticism. Apart from vegetables and beet sour, his recipe calls for a roast chicken, a fried chicken, a duck, a piece of veal, an oxtail, a marrow bone, one pound of bacon, and six large sausages, and suggests serving with beef quenelles, deviled eggs and croûtons. , 's apprentice, who was mostly fascinated by the soup's vivid ruby-red color, simplified his master's recipe, while also securing the place of [...] ("borscht soup") in French cuisine. [...] and , both of whom had been employed at Polish aristocratic courts, presented borscht to the French public as a Polish soup; their cookbook, , published in 1856, contains a borscht recipe under the descriptive name, [...] ("Polish-style beet-juice soup"), which had been changed to [...] by the third edition in 1868. In 1867, beetroot borscht was served, along with herrings, sturgeon, coulibiac, Pozharsky cutlets and vinaigrette salad, at a Russian-themed dinner at the International Exposition in Paris, strengthening its international association with Russian culture.|$|E

2500|$|Over time, many Londoners {{came forward}} with their own unusual anecdotes attesting to Lambe’s [...] "demonic" [...] or [...] "devilish" [...] nature. [...] Some claimed that he had struck {{political}} foes with impotence, and others blamed him for a 1626 whirlwind along the Thames which allegedly unearthed corpses in a churchyard. One of the strangest accounts is recorded in Richard Baxter's 1691 Certainty of the World of Spirits. [...] According to this story, Lambe once invited an audience into an inner room of his house, where he demonstrated his powers by conjuring a miniature tree and three miniature woodsmen, who chopped it down. [...] One man allegedly gathered wood chips from the tree as evidence, but the pieces attracted violent storms to his house, and he soon disposed of them. [...] Skeptics continued <b>to</b> <b>scoff</b> at such accounts, dismissing Lambe as “a notable mountebank and impostor", but many others were firmly convinced that Lambe was a dangerous magician.|$|E

40|$|Background Although Disordered Eating Behaviors (DEB) is an {{ill-defined}} concept, multiple {{studies have}} examined prevalence of DEB and its relations to other variables in various populations. DEB {{have been shown to}} predict more serious eating disorders which in turn can lead to death. Mostly girls seem to suffer from DEB, but the question has been raised whether this, at least, partially is due to the methods used for screening. The SCOFF-questionnaire has been suggested as a quick and easily administered tool to assess DEB. However, the psychometric results regarding SCOFF suggest some inconsistencies, and more research is needed in various countries and age samples. Method <b>To</b> validate <b>SCOFF,</b> a total of 1265 Swedish adolescents (51. 6  % girls) completed self-report questionnaires using the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) as a reference standard. Results The factor analyses show inconclusive results as <b>to</b> whether <b>SCOFF</b> should be regarded as a comprehensive scale; furthermore, the results indicate a correlation between SCOFF and the EDE-Q in both girl and boy samples. Girls scored significantly higher on SCOFF and also had a higher total score, indicating more severe problems than boys. Conclusions The results raised questions as <b>to</b> whether the <b>SCOFF</b> might be interpreted and responded to in different ways by girls and boys, risking overlooking boys’ DEB and also whether one “yes” answer, instead of the stipulated two, could be sufficient when using SCOFF for screening purposes. In sum, the results challenge the use of SCOFF in a general adolescent population...|$|R
