500|$|As a show, Torchwood {{is highly}} intertextual. The {{consequence}} {{of this is that}} many sides of Jack are shown across various media. One commentator feels that this emphasises Jack's pivotal place in the development and change of modern science fiction heroes. The character's unexpected popularity with a multitude of audiences, would later shape his appearances both as a traditional [...] "action hero" [...] and as a positive role model for younger viewers. Barrowman also remarks that [...] "The beauty of Captain Jack, and one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> think, as an actor, I've landed on my feet, is that he's popular with one audience in Torchwood and with another in Doctor Who." ...|$|E

Williams starts the song with the line, [...] "Well there's three versions of this story / Mine and yours and then the truth", whilst Barlow responds channeling his original attempt for reconciliation, [...] "I read your mind and tried to call / My tears could fill the Albert Hall."

He was better known for his work on soap operas such as General Hospital and Another World. He pitched stories for [...] on the basis that the show targeted an adult audience similar to [...] and not children. He {{knew it was going to}} be broadcast on Saturday mornings, but would be unhampered by restrictions on live-action television. He later said [...] "that was one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> took it, because I'm not an animated writer... I had written a couple of animated shows through the years, and it was like pulling teeth." [...] He explained that he wrote the script for [...] "The Survivor" [...] as if it was a live-action story; it was originally known as [...] "The Chameleon".

Bana {{had read}} the book Lone Survivor prior to production, and was willing {{to appear in the}} film, {{regardless}} of which role was offered to him. Upon being cast as Kristensen, Bana researched the fallen serviceman and his family. On joining the production of Lone Survivor, Bana stated, [...] "There are two factors that make this story special, and they are <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> jumped on board. One is the story itself, and two is who chooses to direct a project like this. I knew how involved [...] would be and that he would know how to portray SEAL teammates. That was what I {{wanted to be a part}} of. The greatest way to honor these guys is to make a great film and have it stand the test of time." [...] Bana did not physically prepare for the role. [...] "My responsibility was really to understand the role of the mission commander and the relevant information with respect with the chain of command and what it means to go in the QRF and the processes involved", he explained. [...] "It was far more important to be the person that was responsible for that part of the story and understand that completely. There's no purpose in me going out and firing an M4 in this case." ...|$|E

Auf der Maur toured {{with the band}} for the Sacred and Profane tour in support of Machina/The Machines of God (2000) and appeared in the music videos accompanying its release. In May 2000, The Smashing Pumpkins disbanded and Auf der Maur did not have plans to continue her music career. In an interview with Jam!, Auf der Maur said: [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> took 2001 off is I didn't even know what I {{was going to do}} with music. Maybe I was going to play in a cover band the rest of my life" [...] and that her [...] "relationship to music had become very army-oriented. I was a soldier, a hard worker who never got enough satisfaction from the music. I didn't know if I was going to make my own record." [...] In late 2001, Auf der Maur discovered [...] "old demos" [...] in her Montréal residence and [...] "realized [...] had an entire album's worth of material that had been sitting there for years."

I guess you don't realize something is missing until you feel it. I can't imagine walking away from my little girl. I can't imagine not having that love anymore. I didn't know it was missing because I never had it. It was a revelation and that's why I wrote that song. I {{think a lot of people}} go through that.|$|E
