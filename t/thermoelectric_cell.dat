40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} high-efficiency reversible thermoelectric conversion devices for thermoelectric power generation through liquid potassium-ammonia (K-NH 3) solutions. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed design is verified by thermoelectric experiments using two kinds of “U”-shaped vacuum cells with a NH 3 -gas passageway connecting both legs of “U”, one of which has a waist {{in the middle of}} a liquid flow passage. The experimental results show that the gas passageway provides a stable and reliable reaction by preventing an internal pressure imbalance due to NH 3 gasification during solution decomposition; hence, long-term, reversible thermoelectric power can be effectively derived by stably inducing two separate phase transitions in the cell. In addition, the effect of the narrow waist in the cell’s middle is verified to cause an increase in thermoelectric conversion efficiency due to improved electric conductivity of liquid in the vacuum cell.

With {{the growing}} energy command due to growing world people and industrialization, {{utilizing}} strenuous solar energy for thermal and electrical power production {{will be the}} future renewable power source to decrease the confidence on fossil fuel and reduce carbon dioxide discharge.

It was found that Nitrogen doping of CNT's enhances reaction kinetics of the Ferro/Ferricyanide redox reaction. It is suggested {{that there will be}} an ideal level of doping, where the electron transfer rate is maximized. TBAN showed the highest open circuit voltage, but it was discovered that TBAN in dodecanol was unsuitable as an electrolyte for thermocells due to low conductivity and unstable current.

The eciency was 0. 007 % of the Carnot efficiency, which is less than state-of-the art electrolyte thermo- cells.

40|$|Salinity-gradient solar ponds {{can collect}} and store solar heat at {{temperatures}} up to 80 C. As a result, these water bodies {{act as a}} renewable source of low grade heat which can be utilized for heating and power generation applications. In this paper, design and test result of the combined system of thermosyphon and thermoelectric modules (TTMs) for the generation of electricity from low grade thermal sources like solar pond is discussed. In solar ponds, temperature difference in the range 40 - 60 C is available between the lower convective zone (LCZ) and the upper convective zone (UCZ) which can be applied across the hot and cold surfaces of the thermoelectric modules {{to make it work}} as a power generator.

40|$|Renewable {{energy is}} {{becoming}} {{an important source of}} energy due to the rise in crude oil prices and the increase in greenhouse effects due to burning of fossil fuels. With only finite source of fossil fuel and exponential increase in the demand of power because of increase in human population, power generation from renewable energy promises a sustainable future for the mankind. Currently, solar thermal technologies convert energy from the sun into useful thermal energy. Solar energy is intermittent in nature and most solar thermal technologies require separate collectors and storage systems. This makes them expensive to operate. Furthermore, power generation from low grade heat is currently restricted to vapour compression cycles with low reliability and high maintenance cost. There is a need to explore low cost integrated solar thermal collector and storage system and an alternative technology to convert this low grade heat into electricity. A salinity gradient solar pond is a low-cost solar collector with long term thermal storage capability. It utilizes a large body of saline water with increasing density gradient from top to bottom that absorb solar radiation and stores the thermal energy. Solar ponds have been simple and low cost solar energy system for a relatively longer period of time and very stable with the intermittent supply of solar energy. A thermoelectric generator (TEG) has the advantage that it can operate from a low grade heat source such as waste heat energy. Heat is supplied at hot side of the <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>cell</b> while the other end is maintained at a lower temperature by a heat sink. As a result of the temperature difference, Seebeck voltage is generated that result in current flow through an external load resistance. There are no moving components in the TEG and this will lead to a reliable, quiet and maintenance free operation for power generation. Although Organic Rankine Cycles (ORC) engine is currently used to generate electricity from solar pond using low grade heat, it still requires a certain threshold in the temperature difference of the system. The TEGs however works without any temperature difference threshold needed for its operation. The main aims of this project are to develop a system for conversion of low grade heat (&lt; 100 &ordm;C) to work and effective utilisation of low driving temperature differences from low grade heat for heat to work conversion. This thesis examines the potential of power generation from solar pond using TEGs with innovative new designs. Theoretical analysis was developed to investigate the performance of TEGs with low grade heat input. The thesis also explains the systematic procedure of design and manufacturing of TEG heat exchangers. Experimental test rigs and instrumentations used for testing the prototypes are explained in detail.

40|$|The {{thermoelectric}} {{devices have}} been introduced for over 50 years and numerous research and methods {{have been carried out}} to improve its conversion efficiency, represented by the figure of merit, Despite having a low conversion efficiency compared to other heat engine, thermoelectric is gaining attention owing to its stationary and simplest operating condition that requires no maintenance. From the literature study conducted, most of the applications of the thermoelectric generators are focusing on generating electricity from a non-storage heat source, which means in order to avoid intermittency in the power supply due to temporary unavailability of adequate heat source; a battery storage system is needed. In order to address an alternative for the aforementioned scenario, a thermal storage system that will able to constantly providing sufficient heat for power generation is proposed, which introduces the solar pond (SP) as the heat source. Acting as a solar energy collector as well as thermal storage, solar ponds have been available in large scale for providing low grade heat source from 50 &ordm;C to 100 &ordm;C. Moreover, in terms of scalability, both thermoelectric generators and solar pond are highly scalable in size. As the <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>cells</b> are able to work interchangeably between heat pump and heat engine, it results in two variations of the <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>cells</b> available in the market, being sold as Peltier cooler and thermoelectric generators, with a significant price difference (the former is costing less than the latter).
