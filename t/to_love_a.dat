25|$|In 1738, Montagu {{wrote to}} Harley {{explaining}} {{that she had}} no desire for men or marriage. She saw marriage as a rational and expedient convention and did not suppose it possible <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>a</b> man. In 1742 she married Edward Montagu, grandson of the Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich, who owned numerous coal mines and had several rents and estates in Northumberland. She was twenty-two and he was fifty years old. The marriage was advantageous, but it was apparently not very passionate. All the same, she bore a son, John, the next year, and she loved her child immensely. When he died unexpectedly in 1744, she was devastated. She and Edward remained friendly throughout their remaining time together, but there were no more children or pregnancies. Prior to the loss of her son, she had not been very religious, but his death brought her to consider religion more and more. Meanwhile, her sister, Sarah Scott, was growing increasingly devout.|$|E
25|$|A {{handsome}} young prince {{lives in a}} luxurious castle in France. He has everything he ever wanted, and as a result, he is spoiled, selfish and unkind. One night, his kindness is {{put to the test}} when a beggar woman comes to the castle and asks for shelter from the freezing cold, with a single rose as payment. When he shuns the beggar for her repulsive appearance, she then reveals her true form as a beautiful enchantress. Seeing her beauty and realizing her power, the Prince tries to apologize but she transforms him into a terrifying beast-like creature for his arrogance. She also casts a spell on the entire castle, transforming it into a dark, foreboding place, its lush green grounds into dangerous immortal wolf-infested woods, and the good-natured servants into anthropomorphic household objects to reflect their different personalities. Ashamed of his new appearance, the Beast conceals himself inside his castle with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world, and an enchanted rose that would act as the curse's timer which would bloom until he turns 21. If the Beast could learn <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>a</b> woman and earn her love in return before the final petal fell off the rose, the curse would be broken, but if not he would remain a beast forever. The Beast turns to despair as the years pass by, with little hope of achieving this.|$|E

500|$|... "Love a Woman" [...] is a down-tempo soulful R ballad with {{a female}} {{empowerment}} theme and live-sounding instruments. The soothing track starts off with Blige singing with a dark voice, [...] "So {{you think you know}} how <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>a</b> woman/ But I think it's still some things you need to know." [...] As the flowery instrumental builds with a serene piano melody and accentuating horns, Blige goes on to warn that a woman needs more than material things. A writer of Billboard magazine further noted that the song was schooling men on just how good <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>a</b> woman. During her lines, Beyoncé sings with a vibrato voice, [...] "A woman / Needs you to make love to her / She needs more than sex / Oh, a real woman needs a real man / They don’t talk about it, be about it / Put that work in, still shows his woman real romance". According to Rob Markman of MTV News, [...] "From there, the song plays as a lyrical how-to. Communication is a must, as is respect, but coming home late and being a one-minute man is a no-no." [...] Writers further noted that the duet was inspired by the music from the 1990s including a new jack swing-era R production. Beyoncé and Blige further sing the lines [...] "She doesn’t want makeup sex, she wants your respect." [...] The song also has an extended bridge section during the 2:30 mark where Blige sings the lines [...] "Pick up your phone…just to say you're still in love from time to time…" [...] with a vocal styling which was compared to Michael Jackson's [...] "Off the Wall" [...] era. It ends with the sound of sparkler synths.Jada Gomez-Lacayo of HipHopDx compared the song with Aaron Hall's material. Ayanna Guyhto of Yahoo! Music compared the first minute of the song with Busta Rhymes' songs due to the speedy wordplay. She further noted that it was similar to the songs by Keith Sweat from the 1990s.|$|E
500|$|Anthony Addabbo {{temporarily}} {{took over}} the role, first airing on April 6, 2001. To prepare for the role, he watched tapes of Nader's portrayal of Dimitri {{in order to see}} the relationships between Dimitri and other characters. Despite the fan protest against the role being recast, Addabbo told Soap Opera Digest he was not worried. [...] "I don't find it intimidating," [...] he said. [...] "I know how they can come <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>a</b> certain actor portraying a role and how he plays the role and everything, but this happens in daytime so frequently that I didn't find it intimidating at all." [...] Soap Opera Digest considered him an odd choice for a Dimitri recast since Addabbo usually portrayed [...] "all-American good guys" [...] such as Generations Jason Craig and Guiding Lights Jim LeMay. A large number of All My Children fans rejected Addabbo in the role and continued to campaign for Nader's return. The controversy forced the writers to lessen Dimitri's role on the show until July 2001 when Addabbo was let go [...] "for storyline reasons", according to ABC's official statement.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Belle's {{relationship}} with the Beast has also been met with positive reviews. About.com's David Nusair wrote that [...] "the palpable chemistry between Belle and The Beast ensur that Beauty and the Beast {{lives up to its}} {{reputation as one of the}} most memorable romances of all time." [...] Describing it as an [...] "unconventional romance," [...] Charles Solomon of the Los Angeles Times opined, [...] "The idea of a young woman learning <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>a</b> gentle heart hidden beneath a baleful exterior represented a major break with tradition." [...] Likewise, critics enjoyed O'Hara's performance. According to Variety, Belle was [...] "magnificently voiced by O’Hara." [...] The Star-Ledger's Stephen Whitty enjoyed O'Hara's [...] "pretty soprano." [...] John Hartl of The Seattle Times wrote, [...] "O'Hara does a spirited job of investing the character with warmth, intuition and maturity," [...] while the Sun-Sentinel's Candice Russel felt that O'Hara [...] "does a good job of creating Belle as intellectual, wisely feminine and disarmed by the stirrings of her heart." [...] According to the Young Writers Society, Belle remains the best-reviewed Disney Princess to-date.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] {{are about a}} gender-swapping thought experiment, through which Beyoncé {{analyses}} the ideologies of a tense relationship. As she sings about things she would do {{if she were a}} boy, Beyoncé highlights the vulnerability of a woman and ponders how things would be different if men had women's sense of empathy. During {{the first part of the}} ballad, Beyoncé alternates between the role of her flawed partner and that of the better man she would be. In the first verse, she envisions herself impersonating her unfeeling love interest as she sings about consuming beer with other men, chasing after girls, and treating her lover cruelly, before adding that she would never be confronted for it. Beyoncé then sings the chorus, in which she gives her vision of life as a better man, [...] "I think I could understand / How it feels <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>a</b> girl / I swear I'd be a better man", because she knows [...] "how it hurts when you lose the one you wanted / 'cause he's taken you for granted and everything you had got destroyed".|$|E
500|$|In 1968, after 25 {{years with}} the Hallé, Barbirolli retired from the {{principal}} conductorship; no successor was appointed in his lifetime. He was appointed the orchestra's Conductor Laureate. He {{reduced the number of}} his appearances with the Hallé, but nevertheless took it on another European tour in 1968, this time to Switzerland, Austria and Germany. In his last years a propensity to concentrate on detail {{at the expense of the}} whole of a piece became marked. His loyal friend and admirer the critic Neville Cardus wrote privately in 1969, [...] "he seems so much <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>a</b> single phrase that he lingers over it, caressing it; meanwhile the general momentum is lost." [...] His final year, 1970, was dogged by heart trouble; he suffered collapses in April, May, June and July. His last two concerts were with the Hallé at the 1970 King's Lynn Festival. He produced [...] "inspired" [...] renderings of Elgar's Symphony No. 1 and Sea Pictures. The last work he conducted in public was Beethoven's Symphony No. 7 on the Saturday before his death.

Speaking about her character's exit storyline, Anderson said [...] "When I read the final script for Charlie's exit, I made sure I was in the privacy of my own home. It was written really well – it was a tragic love story and I hope the fans like it." [...] The actress explained that the storyline was great and the writers had done a brilliant job with Charlie and Brax. She also said some fans would be disappointed that the couple did not end up together. Anderson revealed that the series producer had told her that after investing so much in getting Charlie together with Brax, she would not have left the Bay for another reason and killing her off was the best way. Of her reaction to the storyline, Anderson said [...] "I started sobbing! But that was the initial shock. You play this character {{for three and a half}} years and you really empathise with them.

500|$|In {{his review}} for the DVD Verdict, Bryan Pope wrote that [...] "the show's charm {{lies in the}} vast world of {{nautical}} nonsense" [...] and that the show is [...] "a world of aquanaut squirrels, clarinet-playing squids, underwater campfires, retired superheroes, plankton obsessed with world domination, and the most head-scratching family units I've ever come across (a crab and a puffer fish are parents to a teenage whale, while pint-sized Plankton {{is married to a}} no-nonsense computer named Karen)." [...] Pope pointed out that the season [...] "remains the high point for the series" [...] as it had produced [...] "classic" [...] episodes such as [...] "No Weenies Allowed", [...] "SpongeBob Meets the Strangler", and [...] "Krusty Krab Training Video". However, Pope described [...] "The Lost Episode" [...] as a [...] "misstep" [...] that [...] "veers too far away from Bikini Bottom and into unfunny live-action territory." [...] Furthermore, various celebrities—including Justin Timberlake, Kelly Osbourne, Britney Spears, Bruce Willis, Noel Gallagher, rapper Dr. Dre, and Mike Myers—were reported to be fans of the show. American actor Rob Lowe said, [...] "You've got <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>a</b> sponge in tightie whities."

500|$|Rob Markman of MTV News {{wrote that}} the singers [...] "display good {{chemistry}} on the song".

R production, blasts the notion that MJB is all raw power and Beyoncé is all chilly technique — the women are both bold and great here, with a slight advantage going to Blige." [...] Becky Bain of the website Idolator commented that Garrett who served as a writer for the song [...] "clearly knows how <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>a</b> woman right". A writer of Rap-Up magazine noted that Blige and Beyoncé [...] "showcase their powerful pipes" [...] as they tell their men what they want from a relationship. Brooklyne Gipson of Black Entertainment Television {{wrote that the}} song was one of the most appealing on the album, further describing it as a [...] "breathtaking duet". Martyn Young of the website musicOMH described the song as [...] "a classy duet between two of contemporary RnB’s most striking voices". Siobhan Kane of the website Consequence of Sound noted that Blige and Beyoncé obviously enjoyed [...] "the soaring nature of the song", while Alex Young of the same publication described it as a [...] "lesson in love". Nathan S. of DJBooth described the song as an [...] "inter-generational diva duet that sounds so ‘90s I half expected Keith Sweat to jump in". Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush graded the song with four out of five stars and commented, [...] "'Love a Woman' is a melodic song with a ’90s-sounding feel that will surely get spins on urban radio and quiet storm formats. Forget Dr. Phil, MJB and Ms. B is all you need to help you maintain a loving relationship with your partner." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kingdom of the Sun was to {{have been}} a tale of a greedy, selfish emperor (voiced by David Spade) who finds a peasant (voiced by Owen Wilson) who looks just like him; the emperor swaps places with the peasant to escape his boring life and have fun, much as in author Mark Twain's archetypal novel The Prince and the Pauper. However, the evil witch Yzma has plans to summon the evil god Supai and destroy the sun so that she may retain her youth forever (the sun gives her wrinkles, so she surmises that living in a world of {{darkness}} would prevent her from wrinkling). Discovering the switch between the prince and the peasant, Yzma turns the real emperor into a llama and threatens to reveal the pauper's identity unless he obeys her. The emperor-llama learns humility in his new form, and even comes <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>a</b> female llama-herder named Mata (voiced by Laura Prepon). Together, the girl and the llama set out to undo the witch's plans. The book Reel Views 2 says the film would have been a [...] "romantic comedy musical in the 'traditional' Disney style".|$|E

[...] "Stand by Your Man" [...] was {{reportedly}} {{written in the}} Epic studio in just 15minutes by Billy Sherrill and Wynette, and was released {{at a time when}} the women's-rights movement was beginning to stir in the U.S. The message in the song stated that a woman should stay with her man, despite his faults and shortcomings. It stirred up controversy and was criticized initially, and it became a lightning rod for feminists. Nevertheless, the song became very successful, reaching the top spot on the Country charts, and was also a top-20 pop hit, peaking at number 19 on the Billboard pop charts in 1968, Wynette's only top-40 hit as a solo artist on the pop charts. In 1969, Wynette won the Grammy award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance for [...] "Stand by Your Man", which is now, according to critics, considered a [...] "classic" [...] or Country music [...] "standard".
