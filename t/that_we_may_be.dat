2500|$|As Carol Polsgrove {{has shown}} in Ending British Rule in Africa: Writers in a Common Cause, Padmore {{and his allies}} in the 1930s and 1940s—among them C. L. R. James, Kenya's Jomo Kenyatta, the Gold Coast's Kwame Nkrumah and South Africa's Peter Abrahams—saw {{publishing}} as a strategy for political change. They published small periodicals, which were sometimes seized by authorities {{when they reached the}} colonies. They published articles in other people's periodicals, for instance, the Independent Labour Party's New Leader. They published pamphlets. They wrote letters to the editor; and, thanks to the support of publisher Fredric Warburg (of Secker & Warburg), they published books. Warburg brought out Padmore's Africa and World Peace (1937), as well as books by both Kenyatta and James. In a Foreword to Africa and World Peace, Labour politician Sir Stafford Cripps wrote: [...] "George Padmore has performed another great service of enlightenment in this book. The facts he discloses so ruthlessly are undoubtedly unpleasant facts, the story which he tells of the colonization of Africa is sordid in the extreme, but both the facts and the story are true. We have, so many of us, been brought up in the atmosphere of 'the white man's burden', and have had our minds clouded and confused by the continued propaganda for imperialism <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> almost shocked by this bare and courageous exposure of the great myth of the civilizing mission of western democracies in Africa." [...] The Biographical Note on the cover describes Padmore as European correspondent for the Pittsburgh Courier, Gold Coast Spectator, African Morning Post, Panama Tribune, Belize Independent and Bantu World.|$|E

2500|$|The prayer [...] "Hanc igitur" [...] {{has some}} difficulties. The Greek version adds a rubric before it: [...] "Here he names the dead". What can the [...] "Hanc igitur" [...] {{have to do}} with the dead? The Antiochene Liturgy, in which several {{parallel}} passages to the modern Canon have already been noticed, has a parallel to the second half of this prayer too, and that parallel occurs in its commemoration of the dead. There, following a prayer that the dead may rest [...] "in the land of the living, in thy kingdom [...] [...] [...] in the bosom of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob", etc., is found this continuation: [...] "And keep for us in peace, O Lord, a Christian, well-pleasing and sinless end to our lives, gathering us under the feet of thy Elect, when Thou willest and as Thou willest, only without shame and offence; through thy only begotten Son our Lord and God and Saviour, Jesus Christ." [...] We notice here the reference to the elect (in electorum tuorum grege), the prayer <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> kept [...] "in peace" [...] (in tuâ pace disponas), the allusion to the [...] "end of our lives" [...] (diesque nostros) and the unusual [...] "Per Christum Dominum nostrum", making a break in the middle of the Eucharistic prayer. The Syrian form with its plain reference to death ("the end of our lives") seems more clearly to be a continuation of a prayer for the faithful departed. But in the Roman form too is found such a reference in the words about hell (ab æterna damnatione) and heaven (in electorum tuorum grege).|$|E
2500|$|St. Ignatius of Antioch {{spoke in}} [...] "praise of unity" [...] in a Letter to the Ephesians, saying [...] "He, therefore, {{that does not}} {{assemble}} with the Church, has even by this manifested his pride, and condemned himself. For it is written, 'God resisteth the proud.' Let us be careful, then, not to set ourselves {{in opposition to the}} bishop, in order <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> subject to God". Stressing the relationship between the Church initiated by Jesus and the hierarchy set in motion by the apostles, Ignatius writes: [...] "we should look upon the bishop even as we would upon the Lord Himself" [...] (§6). Ignatius stresses the hierarchical relationship between God and the bishop more strongly to the Magnesians urging them [...] "to yield him all reverence, having respect to the power of God the Father, ... submitting to him, or rather not to him, but to the Father of Jesus Christ, the bishop of us all". In §6 he exhorts them to harmony, and in §13 urges them to [...] "tudy ... to be established in the doctrines of the Lord and the apostles, ... with your most admirable bishop...." [...] Thus Ignatius emphasizes unity, obedience, and the hierarchical relationship among the faithful and between the bishop and God. Further elements of the hierarchical relationship are mentioned by St. Clement of Alexandria, referring to advice in the [...] "holy books: some for presbyters, some for bishops and deacons" [...] (Jurgens §413), and writing treatises with titles [...] "On the Unity and Excellence of the Church" [...] and [...] "On the Offices of Bishops, Presbyters, Deacons, and Widows." [...] In his Stromateis, Clement of Alexandria writes that [...] "according to my opinion, the grades here in the Church, of bishops, presbyters, deacons, are imitations of the angelic glory, and of that economy which, the Scriptures say, awaits those who, following the footsteps of the apostles, have lived in perfection of righteousness according to the Gospel".|$|E
2500|$|Series b however, {{completely}} refutes {{the basic}} concepts of empiricism. It begins by declaring that [...] "Mans perceptions are not bounded by organs of perception, he perceives more than sense (thou' ever so acute) can discover." [...] As such, Man can indeed discover aspects beyond his own immediate experience; [...] "Reason or {{the ratio of}} all we have already known. {{is not the same}} as it shall be when we know more." [...] Blake points out that Man is fundamentally desirous of discovering more and moving beyond the bounds of his specific physicality, which is nothing more than a restriction; [...] "The bounded is loathed by its possessor." [...] As a result, Man yearns to know that which he does not yet know because [...] "Less than all cannot satisfy Man." [...] However, Man should never desire more than he can possess, because [...] "if any could desire what he is incapable of possessing, despair must be his eternal lot." [...] However, because Man tends to desire the infinite, thus [...] "the desire of Man being Infinite the possession is Infinite & himself Infinite." [...] That is to say, if Man can only desire what he can possess, yet he desires the infinite, then he must be able to possess the infinite. Blake takes from this that if Man's desires and possessions can be infinite, then Man too must be Infinite, and, by extension, Man can see the Infinite. Indeed, not to see the Infinite is a perversion of Man's true nature, as defined by the Poetic Genius; [...] "If it were not for the Poetic or Prophetic character. the Philosophic & Experimental would soon be at the ratio of all things & stand still, unable to do other than repeat the same dull round over again"; i.e. Man is made to do more than perceive and experience through the senses only. Furthermore, to see the Infinite is to see God, which is to transcend the sensate ("the Ratio"); [...] "He who sees the Infinite in all things sees God. He who sees the Ratio only sees himself only." [...] Therefore, for Man to see God, he must be as God, and as such, [...] "God becomes as we are <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> as he is." ...|$|E
