5|$|The National Press Monument {{regularly}} conducts seminars {{regarding the}} press, media, and communications.

The digital collection and library is accessible to the general public, while researchers may access paper copies of <b>the</b> <b>newspapers</b> <b>and</b> magazines.|$|E
5|$|To {{ensure a}} {{free flow of}} funds on Monday, the New York Clearing House issued $100 million in loan {{certificates}} to be traded between banks to settle balances, allowing them to retain cash reserves for depositors. Reassured both by the clergy and <b>the</b> <b>newspapers,</b> <b>and</b> with bank balance sheets flush with cash, a sense of order returned to New York that Monday.|$|E

Gravel ended the session by, with no other senators present, establishing unanimous consent to insert 4,100 pages of the Papers into the Congressional Record of his subcommittee. The following day, the Supreme Court's New York Times Co. v. United States decision ruled in favor of <b>the</b> <b>newspapers</b> <b>and</b> publication in The Times and others resumed. In July 1971, Bantam Books published an inexpensive paperback edition of the papers containing the material The Times had published.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s, Rockefeller {{expanded}} into iron ore and ore transportation, forcing {{a collision with}} steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, and their competition became a major subject of <b>the</b> <b>newspapers</b> <b>and</b> cartoonists. He went on a massive buying spree acquiring leases for crude oil production in Ohio, Indiana, and West Virginia, as the original Pennsylvania oil fields began to play out. Amid the frenetic expansion, Rockefeller {{began to think of}} retirement. The daily management of the trust was turned over to John Dustin Archbold and Rockefeller bought a new estate, Pocantico Hills, north of New York City, turning more time to leisure activities including the new sports of bicycling and golf.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} media, {{newspapers}} were {{controlled by the}} state, with the Reich Press Chamber shutting down or buying newspapers and publishing houses. By 1939, over two thirds of <b>the</b> <b>newspapers</b> <b>and</b> magazines were directly owned by the Propaganda Ministry. The NSDAP daily newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter ("Ethnic Observer"), was edited by Alfred Rosenberg, author of The Myth of the Twentieth Century, a book of racial theories espousing Nordic superiority. Goebbels controlled the wire services and insisted that all newspapers in Germany only publish content favourable to the regime. His propaganda ministry issued two dozen directives every week on exactly what news should be published and what angles to use; the typical newspaper followed the directives closely. Newspaper readership plummeted, {{partly because of the}} decreased quality of the content and partly because of the surge in popularity of radio.|$|E

5|$|In 1947, two {{publishers}} {{started a}} legal battle {{for the right to}} the names of <b>the</b> <b>newspapers</b> <b>and</b> magazines. Vandersteen, caught in the middle, worked a while for both, but eventually switched to the new owners of De Standaard. He continued to work for Ons Volkske, which was now renamed 't Kapoentje for a few more months. The publishers of De Standaard also continued the album series of Suske en Wiske, which started modestly with one album in 1946 and one in 1947. By 1947, seven albums were available, and the first ones were already reprinted. The first albums of De Familie Snoek had also appeared by then. Supported by large publicity campaigns, they sold very well: the first Snoek album was in its third impression by 1948. The popularity of Vandersteen, and the impact comics had in Flanders, is attested by the 25,000 readers who switched to the Standaard {{at the same time as}} Vandersteen did.|$|E
5|$|In the {{newspaper}} articles, Cope attacked Marsh for plagiarism and financial mismanagement, and attacked Powell for his geological classification errors and misspending of government-allocated funds. Marsh and Powell were each able to publish their own {{side of the}} story, filing their own charges against Cope. Ballou's articles were poorly researched, written, and read, and Cope himself was smarting from a piece in The Philadelphia Inquirer which suggested the University of Pennsylvania trustees would ask Cope to step down unless he provided proof for his charges against Marsh and Powell. Marsh himself kept the Herald story alive with a fiery rebuttal, {{but by the end}} of January the story had faded from all <b>the</b> <b>newspapers,</b> <b>and</b> little changed between the bitter rivals.|$|E
5|$|It was {{customary}} in {{mid-19th century}} America {{for a candidate}} for high office not to appear to seek it. Thus, Fillmore remained at the comptroller's office in Albany, and made no speeches; the 1848 campaign was conducted in <b>the</b> <b>newspapers</b> <b>and</b> with addresses made by surrogates at rallies. The Democrats nominated Michigan Senator Lewis Cass for president, with General William O. Butler his running mate, {{but it would be}} a three-way fight as the Free Soil Party, opposed to the spread of slavery, chose former president Van Buren. There was a crisis among the Whigs when Taylor also accepted the presidential nomination of a group of dissident South Carolina Democrats. Fearing that Taylor would be an party apostate like Tyler, Weed in late August scheduled a rally in Albany aimed at electing an uncommitted slate of presidential electors, but Fillmore interceded with the editor, assuring him that Taylor was loyal to the party.|$|E

25|$|Revolutionary {{life was}} {{centered}} around political clubs. The Jacobins had their {{headquarters in the}} former Dominican monastery, the Couvent des Jacobins de la rue Saint-Honoré, while its most influential member, Robespierre, lived at 366 (now 398) Rue Saint-Honoré. The Left Bank, near the Odéon Theater, was {{the home of the}} club of Cordeliers, of which the principal members were Jean-Paul Marat, Georges Danton, Camille Desmoulins, and of the printers who published <b>the</b> <b>newspapers</b> <b>and</b> pamphlets that inflamed public opinion.|$|E
