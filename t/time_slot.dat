5|$|After its {{original}} broadcast, the episode attracted almost six million viewers; although it won its <b>time</b> <b>slot,</b> the episode was down by {{over one million}} viewers from the last series premiere. The episode received generally positive reactions for its plot, {{as well as the}} introduction of Lucas and death of Adam.|$|E
5|$|Book Two: Spirits premiered with 2.6 million viewers. Suggested {{explanations}} for the reduced number of broadcast viewers were: the long period between seasons, a change in <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> (Friday evening instead of Saturday morning), the increased availability of digital download services, and generally reduced ratings for the Nickelodeon channel.|$|E

It attained 5.749 million viewers and garnered a 1.8/5 rating in the 18–49 demographic {{in its first}} hour. Gaga's special aired simultaneously with the reruns of The Simpsons on FOX, Person of Interest on CBS, and The Secret Circle on The CW. In its second hour, total viewership and ratings slightly declined to 5.388 million viewers and a 1.6/5 ratings in the 18–49 demographic, despite airing simultaneously with a recap of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade on NBC and a rerun of The Mentalist on CBS. A Very Gaga Thanksgiving failed to beat other Thanksgiving specials in the ratings, including A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving. A Very Gaga Thanksgiving had the highest rating in the 18–49 demographic in its <b>time</b> <b>slot,</b> and total viewership increased by 23% (1.3 million viewers) from its predecessor, singer Beyoncé's 2009 concert, I Am...

5|$|During {{its first}} series, Last of the Summer Wine {{did not receive}} a high ratings share. The second series {{proved to be a}} success, however, and two episodes {{made it to the top}} ten {{programmes}} of the week. The programme has since consistently been a favourite in the ratings, peaking at 18.8million viewers for an episode shown on 10 February 1985. The premiere of the 28th series in 2007 brought in an 18.6 percent share of viewers in the 6:20 <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> with an average of 3.2million viewers. Last of the Summer Wine's audience grew from 2.7million to 3.4million over the 30minutes. The show was beaten for the night only by Channel 4's Big Brother with 3.6million viewers at 9:00p.m., although the reality show had a smaller share of viewers for its <b>time</b> <b>slot.</b> The 29th series finale, which was broadcast on 31 August 2008, was watched by 4.2 million people, giving the network a 22.5% share for the night.|$|E

40|$|The main {{contribution}} {{of this work}} is to propose energyefficient randomized initialization protocols for ad-hoc radio networks (ARN, for short). First, we show that if the number n of stations is known beforehand, the single-channel ARN can be initialized by a protocol that terminates, with high probability, in O(n) <b>time</b> <b>slots</b> with no station being awake for more than O(log n) <b>time</b> <b>slots.</b> We {{then go on to}} address the case where the number n of stations in the ARN is not known beforehand. We begin by discussing, an elegant protocol that provides a tight approximation of n. Interestingly, this protocol terminates, with high probability, in O((log n) 2) <b>time</b> <b>slots</b> and no station has to be awake for more than O(log n) <b>time</b> <b>slots.</b> We use this protocol to design an energy-efficient initialization protocol that terminates, with high probability, in O(n) <b>time</b> <b>slots</b> with no station being awake for more than O(log n) <b>time</b> <b>slots.</b> Finally, we design an energy-efficient initializa [...] ...|$|R

The series aired on the Sundance Channel from September 20 to November 8, 2005, and on Logo TV from January 9 to February 27, 2006. Both channels gave it an evening <b>time</b> <b>slot.</b> The Sundance Channel reran the series in May 2012, followed by a marathon in June. In Italy, it was syndicated by the satellite television channel Cult in 2006.|$|E
5|$|On May 8, 2014, ABC renewed {{the series}} for an {{eleventh}} season that aired from September 2014 to May 2015).

30|$|When {{the channel}} is time-variant and {{correlated}} across <b>time</b> <b>slots,</b> {{it is possible}} to exploit the information about the channel across <b>time</b> <b>slots</b> by an appropriate filtering and benefit from contamination randomization. In this paper, channel estimation across multiple <b>time</b> <b>slots</b> is performed using {{a modified version of the}} Kalman filter, which is capable of tracking the channel and the channel correlation. The level of contamination suppression depends on the channel correlation between slots of the UE of interest as well as the contaminators. In LTE, channel correlation between <b>time</b> <b>slots</b> is large even at medium-high speeds, making the proposed solution very efficient.|$|R
