Messengers from the lords of Cuscatlan brought promises of submission to the King of Spain, but when Pedro de Alvarado's army arrived at the city, he found {{that the majority of the}} inhabitants had fled. Alvarado sent messengers to them, ordering them to return and submit, but they refused. Alvarado <b>tried</b> <b>them</b> in their absence, and condemned them to death; he branded all the Pipil prisoners as slaves.|$|E
5|$|Further {{activities}} of Operation Labrador were abandoned in September, after Croatian authorities captured the Yugoslav Air Force regional headquarters in Zagreb, and confiscated {{documents related to}} the operation. The authorities took nearly a month to analyze the captured documents, allowing time for the principal agents involved in the bombings to flee. Fifteen others were arrested {{in connection with the}} attack, but they were subsequently released in a prisoner exchange. Five KOS agents involved in Operation Labrador were tried in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on terrorism charges and acquitted. Croatian authorities captured two KOS agents who were part of the operation and <b>tried</b> <b>them</b> along with seven other agents who were tried in absentia. Those in custody were acquitted, while those tried in absentia were convicted.|$|E

25|$|A March 16 MONUC {{report found}} {{widespread}} illegal {{arrest and detention}} of minors, particularly street children and children associated with armed groups. Although the recruitment or retention of child soldiers is illegal, military authorities sometimes arrested demobilized child soldiers on charges of desertion and <b>tried</b> <b>them</b> in military courts. Civilian courts on occasion tried child soldiers for possessing illegal arms, {{even though they had}} been illegally recruited as combatants.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 7 astronauts Clay Anderson and Rick Mastracchio {{performed}} {{their second}} spacewalk of the STS-131 mission. Mastracchio and Anderson exited the airlock at 05:30 UTC, a full 45 minutes {{ahead of the}} planned time, and spent 7 hours and 26 minutes outside the ISS. The pair removed the old Ammonia Tank Assembly (ATA) from the S1 truss and installed the new ATA. Anderson and Mastracchio ran into a small problem {{when one of the}} four bolts that holds the tank in place wouldn't turn. They loosened the other three and <b>tried</b> <b>them</b> all again and the fourth bolt was successfully tightened. The two spacewalkers helped guide the SSRMS to temporarily stow the old ATA on the truss structure. The new ATA had its electrical connections made, but the fluid connections were deferred until the third spacewalk since the EVA was behind the time-line. Mastracchio and Anderson also installed two radiator grapple fixture stowage beams on the P1 truss. While Anderson and Mastracchio were outside, members of the STS-131 crew continued transferring items from space shuttle Discoverys mid-deck and the MPLM Leonardo. Overall, the crew had completed about half of the transfer work.|$|E

500|$|The MPLA {{government}} arrested tens {{of thousands}} of suspected Nitistas from May to November and <b>tried</b> <b>them</b> in secret courts overseen by Defense Minister Iko Carreira. Those who were found guilty, including Van-Dunem, Jacobo [...] "Immortal Monster" [...] Caetano, the head of the 8th Brigade, and political commissar Eduardo Evaristo, were shot and buried in secret graves. At least 2,000 followers (or alleged followers) of Nito Alves were estimated to have been killed by Cuban and MPLA troops in the aftermath, with some estimates claiming as high as 70,000 dead. The coup attempt had a lasting effect on Angola's foreign relations. Alves had opposed Neto's foreign policy of non-alignment, evolutionary socialism, and multiracialism, favoring stronger relations with the Soviet Union, which Alves wanted to grant military bases in Angola. While Cuban soldiers actively helped Neto put down the coup, Alves and Neto both believed the Soviet Union opposed Neto. Cuban Armed Forces Minister Raúl Castro sent an additional four thousand troops to prevent further dissension within the MPLA's ranks and met with Neto in August in a display of solidarity. In contrast, Neto's distrust of the Soviet leadership increased and relations with the USSR worsened. In December, the MPLA held its first party Congress and changed its name to the MPLA-Worker's Party (MPLA-PT). The Nitista coup took a toll on the MPLA's membership. In 1975, the MPLA had reached 200,000 members, but after the first party congress, that number decreased to 30,000.|$|E
2500|$|Judge Thomas Drummond of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, who was {{overseeing}} numerous railroads {{that had}} declared bankruptcy {{in the wake}} of the earlier financial Panic of 1873, ruled that [...] "A strike or other unlawful interference with the trains will be a violation of the United States law, and the court will be bound to take notice of it and enforce the penalty." [...] Drummond told the U.S. Marshals [...] to protect the railroads, and asked for federal troops to enforce his decision: he subsequently had strikers arrested and <b>tried</b> <b>them</b> for contempt of court.|$|E
2500|$|Drug use (including religious, recreational, and abuse) {{was also}} a theme in many of Dick's works, such as A Scanner Darkly and The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch. Dick himself was a drug user {{for much of his}} life. According to a 1975 {{interview}} in Rolling Stone, Dick wrote all of his books published before 1970 while on amphetamines. [...] "A Scanner Darkly (1977) was the first complete novel I had written without speed", said Dick in the interview. He also experimented briefly with psychedelics, but wrote The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, which Rolling Stone dubs [...] "the classic LSD novel of all time", before he had ever <b>tried</b> <b>them.</b> Despite his heavy amphetamine use, however, Dick later said that doctors told him the amphetamines never actually affected him, that his liver had processed them before they reached his brain.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the episode}} [...] "Numbers" [...] aired on March 2, 2005, {{numerous}} people used the eponymous figures (4, 8, 15, 16, 23, and 42) as lottery entries. According to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, within three days, {{the numbers were}} tried over 500 times by local players. By October 2005, thousands had <b>tried</b> <b>them</b> for the multi-state Powerball lottery. A study of the Quebec Lottery showed that the sequence was the third most popular choice of numbers for lottery players, behind only the arithmetic sequences 1–2–3–4–5–6 and 7–14–21–28–35–42. The issue came to attention after a Mega Millions drawing for a near-record US $380,000,000 jackpot on January 4, 2011, drew a series of numbers in which the three lowest numbers (4–8–15) and the mega ball (42) matched {{four of the six}} numbers. The No. 42 is also the [...] "Mega Number" [...] in Hurley's [...] "Mega Lotto" [...] ticket. The players who played the combination won $150 each (or $118 in California).|$|E
