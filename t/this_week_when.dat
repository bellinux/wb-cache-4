Stated in the cited People article, [...] "The buzz about Aiken's exit was fueled earlier <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>when</b> his picture disappeared online and Billboard, citing unnamed sources, reported Friday that Aiken, 30, {{had been dropped}} by the label. According to Billboard, Aiken's 2008 album [...] "On My Way Here" [...] sold just 159,000 copies in the U.S., compared to his 2003 debut album, [...] "Measure of a Man", which sold 2.78million copies".|$|E

He allowed officials to mislead the public. He hid the tapes because most likely he [...] assumed it would hurt his reelection campaign. Thus he {{not only did the}} immoral thing, he did the politically stupid thing. Cook County state's attorney Anita Alvarez probably would've quickly responded with an indictment—just like she did earlier <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> <b>when</b> the tape actually was released. I mean, it's really hard to look at that tape and not call for an indictment. If the mayor had done that, he wouldn't be the villain in this sordid story. He'd be the hero. Or at least the guy who finally, for once in his life, did the right thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Professor Marty Kaplan of the USC Annenberg School for Communication further argued that, [...] "the {{problem with}} U.S. News' college rankings isn't that {{institutions}} of higher education shouldn't be held accountable for the quality of services they provide [...] The problem is that the fierce competition among colleges to raise their rankings torques the priorities of colleges toward the criteria that U.S. News uses [...] So <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> <b>when</b> an association of 80 liberal arts college presidents, including Barnard, Sarah Lawrence and Kenyon, announced that a majority of them would no longer participate in the U.S. News annual survey, and that they would fashion their own way to collect and report common data, it was bad news for the magazine, but good news for families. It's also good news for American higher education, some of whose institutions may now become less timid about accepting the quirky applicant, less nuts about generating journalistic puff pieces, and more bold about declaring (and living up to) unique educational missions that don't derive from focus groups.|$|E

60|$|February 16.--We {{have had}} such a dull life here all the winter that I have found nothing {{important}} enough to set down, and broke off my journal accordingly. I resume it now to make an entry {{on the subject of}} dear Caroline's future. It seems that she was too grieved, immediately after the loss of our mother, to answer definitely the question of M. de la Feste how long the postponement was to be; then, afterwards, it was agreed that the matter should be discussed on his autumn visit; but as he did not come, it has remained in abeyance till <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> <b>when</b> Caroline, with the greatest simplicity and confidence, has written to him without any further pressure on his part, and told him that she is quite ready to fix the time, and will do so as soon as he arrives to see her. She is a little frightened now, lest it should seem forward in her to have revived the subject of her own accord; but she may assume that his question has been waiting on for an answer ever since, and that she has, therefore, acted only within her promise. In truth, the secret at the bottom of it all is that she is somewhat saddened because he has not latterly reminded her of the pause in their affairs--that, in short, his original impatience to possess her is not now found to animate him so obviously. I suppose that he loves her as much as ever; indeed, I am sure he must do so, seeing how lovable she is. It is mostly thus with all men when women are out of their sight; they grow negligent. Caroline must have patience, and remember that a man of his genius has many and important calls upon his time. In justice to her I must add that she does remember it fairly well, and has as much patience as any girl ever had in the circumstances. He hopes to come at the beginning of April at latest. Well, when he comes we shall see him.|$|E
