This will lead {{to at least one}} zero in that row (We get multiple zeros when there are two equal elements which also happen to be the lowest in that row). This procedure is repeated for all rows.

Finally radio found its undisputed place in peloton for good and, as some races with imposed radio ban proved, the ban changed nothing in racing tactics.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{address the}} expert {{crowdsourcing}} problem, {{in which an}} employer wishes <b>to</b> <b>assign</b> <b>tasks</b> <b>to</b> a set of available workers with heterogeneous working costs. Critically, as workers produce results of varying quality, the utility of each assigned task is unknown and can vary both between workers and individual tasks. Furthermore, in realistic settings, workers {{are likely to have}} limits on the number of tasks they can perform and the employer will have a fixed bud-get to spend on hiring workers. Given these constraints, the objective of the employer is <b>to</b> <b>assign</b> <b>tasks</b> <b>to</b> workers in order to maximise the overall utility achieved. To achieve this, we introduce a novel multi–armed bandit (MAB) model, the bounded MAB, that naturally captures the problem of expert crowdsourcing. We also propose an algorithm to solve it efficiently, called bounded ε–first, which uses the first εB of its total budget B to derive estimates of the workers’ quality characteristics (exploration), while the remaining (1 − ε) B is used to maximise the total utility based on those estimates (ex-ploitation).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} three approaches <b>to</b> <b>assigning</b> <b>tasks</b> <b>to</b> earth observing satellites (EOS). A {{fast and}} simple priority dispatch method is described and shown to produce acceptable schedules {{most of the}} time. A look ahead algorithm is then introduced that outperforms the dispatcher by about 12 % with only a small increase in run time. These algorithms {{set the stage for}} the introduction of a genetic algorithm that uses job permutations as the population. The genetic approach presented here is novel in that it uses two additional binary variables, one to allow the dispatcher to occasionally skip a job in the queue and another to allow the dispatcher to occasionally allocate the worst position to the job. These variables are included in the recombination step in a natural way. The resulting schedules improve on the look ahead by as much as 15 % at times and 3 % on average. We define and use the "window-constrained packing" problem to model the bare bones of the EOS scheduling problem. Scheduling, Algorithms, Genetic...|$|R
