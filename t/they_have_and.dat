5|$|The game {{world is}} not broken up into levels, but is instead one large area not {{separated}} by loading screens. As the player journeys through the largely linear world, they encounter numerous monsters and enemies of varying types that attack whenever the party of player characters approach. The party defends themselves and attacks enemies using melee and ranged weapons, and nature and combat magic. The player does not select a character class for the characters, unlike other role-playing video games; instead, using weapons or magic of a particular type increases the character's skill with them over time. Whenever a player gains enough experience points from killing enemies and reaches a new level in that weapon type, they gain some amount of points in their strength, dexterity, or intelligence statistics, which in turn relate {{to the amount of}} health points and mana that <b>they</b> <b>have,</b> <b>and</b> damage that they do with weapons.|$|E

25|$|Sovereigns {{start with}} a certain amount of magical essence, {{determining}} how much mana <b>they</b> <b>have,</b> <b>and</b> so how many spells they may cast. They may imbue essence into champions, granting limited power at the cost of their own abilities. Essence may also be expended by sovereigns to escape death and return to a nearby settlement. Marriages involving magic-using characters may result in children with magical skills of their own.|$|E
25|$|Telescopic rods {{are popular}} among surf fishermen. Carrying around a 12 or 14ft surf fishing rod, even in two pieces, is cumbersome. The shorter the {{sections}} the shorter they close, the more eyes <b>they</b> <b>have,</b> <b>and</b> {{the better the}} power curve is in them. More eyes means better weight and stress distribution throughout the parabolic arc. This translates to further casting, stronger fish fighting abilities, and less breaking of the rod.|$|E
25|$|Many {{forms of}} amnesia fix {{themselves}} without being treated. However, {{there are a}} few ways to cope with memory loss if that is not the case. One of these ways is cognitive or occupational therapy. In therapy, amnesiacs will develop the memory skills <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>and</b> try to regain some they have lost by finding which techniques help retrieve memories or create new retrieval paths. This may also include strategies for organizing information to remember it more easily and for improving understanding of lengthy conversation.|$|E

25|$|Although {{travellers}} {{within the}} Schengen Area {{are no longer}} required to show documents at an internal border (although {{there have been some}} controversial instances when <b>they</b> <b>have,</b> <b>and</b> it is fairly common at major land border crossings with Switzerland), the laws of most countries still require them to carry identity documents. Thus, foreigners with a valid residence permit in a Schengen State and carrying valid documents can travel within the territory and do not need any special permission to do so. It is the obligation of everyone travelling within the area to be able to show a fully valid form of personal identification approved by other Schengen states.|$|E
25|$|The {{whole notion}} of {{politics}} is they always present you with this or this or this. I'll get a newspaper to read between the lines. Why {{do you have to}} adhere to prescribed formulas that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>and</b> people argue over them and they're all in a box. And you watch Fox claw CNN, and CNN claw Fox. Sometimes I catch a piece of the news and it seems insanity to me. I quietly support candidates. I'm not out there banging a drum for candidates. But I have supported a candidate and it's a whole other world. Once you've been exposed to it, once or twice or however many times, if you know the facts and see how they're presented, it's mind-boggling. It's a very scary arena to be in, but I do vote. I go in there and pull the lever. It's kind of like pulling the lever and watching the trap door fall out from beneath you. Why should we trust any of these people? None of them ever deliver on anything. It's always disappointing.|$|E
500|$|Ian Dunn from One Giant Leap {{also wrote}} positively: [...] "The series has been amazingly gripping. The {{situation}} of the show allows it to be set just about anywhere, much like Doctor Who. The plot is enticing and you really care about the characters." [...] He also commented: [...] "One intriguing thing about the series so far {{is that some of}} the scenarios have been rather adult for a show broadcast at 6pm. One episode, set in a Roman world featured a scene in a sex dungeon. Another featured Cerberus doing what all dogs do (no matter how many heads <b>they</b> <b>have)</b> <b>and</b> urinate on a motorbike – well, half man-half motorbike." ...|$|E

500|$|Some {{sports are}} only held for certain {{disability}} types. [...] For example, goalball {{is only for}} visually impaired athletes. [...] The Paralympics recognizes three different grades of visual impairment, consequently all competitors in goalball must wear a visor or [...] "black out mask" [...] so that athletes with less visual impairment will not have an advantage. Other sports, like athletics, are open to athletes {{with a wide variety}} of impairments. In athletics, participants are broken down into a range of classes based on the disability <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>and</b> then they are placed in a classification within that range based on their level of impairment. [...] For example: classes 11–13 are for visually impaired athletes, which class they are in depends on their level of visual impairment.|$|E
500|$|While {{moving through}} the stages, the player {{encounters}} many monsters, and is forced to battle against them using {{one of their own}} monsters in a puzzle battle based on Bejeweled Twist. The creatures are [...] "variations on fantasy archetypes" [...] and include demons, giant spiders, giant frogs, and beasts inspired by Dungeons & Dragons. The player can only bring three creatures into a stage out of all of the ones that <b>they</b> <b>have,</b> <b>and</b> selects one of the three when a battle begins. A grid of different colored gems is displayed, and the player can select blocks of four jewels and rotate them clockwise. If a line of three or more identical gems is formed, the gems disappear, allowing all of the jewels above the now-vacant spaces in the grid to fall down a row to replace them. New gems appear {{at the top of the}} screen to fill any holes in the grid. If new lines of gems are formed from this movement, the process repeats. Whenever lines are formed, a gauge is filled slightly for the player; when it is full a special gem appears on the board. When that gem is formed into a line, damage is done to the enemy. The enemy also has a gauge, which is filled every time the player performs a rotation, and damage is dealt directly to the player when it is filled.|$|E
500|$|Parasakthi {{received}} critical acclaim. P. Balasubramania Mudaliar of Sunday Observer wrote, [...] "The {{story is}} simple {{but it has}} been made powerful by Mr. Karunanidhi by his beautiful dialogues. Mr. Shivaji Ganesan, who plays the main role dominates from the beginning to the end" [...] and concluded, [...] "If an Academy award were to be given to any picture, I have little doubt that this picture would be entitled on its merits to such an award." [...] Dinamani Kadir, a Tamil weekly owned by Indian Express Limited (then known as The Indian Express Group), carried an unusually long review of Parasakthi running into three closely printed pages. The review was given a cynical title, [...] "Kandarva Mandalam" [...] ("The Abode of Kandarvas") and it began with a small box-item which read, [...] "Parasakthi: This goddess is abused in a Tamil film with her name". The reviewer opined, [...] "The main aim of the film is to attach gods. Along with that, the government and society are overtly and covertly attacked. The embittered and agitated reviewer further claimed, [...] "He , acting as a mad man, threatens and beats the people on the street and grabs whatever <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>and</b> eats it. Then he goes to give repeatedly all those economics lectures, rationalist lectures and anti-god lectures. When we see the hero doing all that, it seems as if he is portraying the lives of those who are trying to force such ideas in the ...film." [...] For the reviewer, thus, the DMK men were living on others' sweat and preaching unacceptable subsersive ideas. The magazine Sivaji praised the dialogues written by Karunanidhi, and the performances of Ganesan and Sahasranamam.|$|E

2500|$|The Geek Code is {{a series}} of letters and symbols used by {{self-described}} [...] "geeks" [...] to inform fellow geeks about their personality, appearance, interests, skills, and opinions. The idea is that everything that makes a geek individual and different from all the other geeks in the world can be written down (encoded) in this very compact format. Then other geeks can read the geek code and work back from that to discover what the writer looks like, what interests <b>they</b> <b>have,</b> <b>and</b> so forth. This is deemed to be efficient in some sufficiently geeky manner.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{campaign}} against the Amalekites, King Saul spared Agag, {{the king of the}} Amalekites, and the best of their livestock. Saul told Samuel that he had spared the choicest of the Amalekites' sheep and oxen, intending to sacrifice the livestock to the Lord. This was in violation of the Lord's command, as pronounced by Samuel, to [...] "... utterly destroy all that <b>they</b> <b>have,</b> <b>and</b> spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass" [...] (1 Samuel 15:3, KJV). Samuel confronted Saul for his disobedience and told him that God made him king, and God can unmake him king. Samuel then proceeded to execute Agag. Saul never saw Samuel alive again after this.|$|E
2500|$|According to one study, {{laws that}} require parental {{notification}} or consent before a minor can obtain an abortion [...] "raise {{the cost of}} risky sex for teenagers." [...] The study found that states which have enacted such laws have seen lower gonorrhea rates among teens than states {{that do not have}} such laws. The researchers of the study believe these laws lower the gonorrhea rate because teens reduce the amount of sexual activity <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>and</b> are more fastidious in their use of birth control. On the contrary, statistics released from the World Health Organization (WHO) indicate that more restrictive laws on abortions do not necessarily mean fewer abortions; the abortion rate one year for Latin America (where, broadly speaking, abortions are generally made illegal) was 32 per 1000 people, whereas the abortion rate for Western Europe (where overall the laws are more relaxed) was 12 in 1000.|$|E

Tensions between Johnny and Sarah begin to rise with the summer heat. Not helping their financial and emotional strain is the discovery that Sarah is pregnant. [...] Eventually Johnny finds work as a cab driver to augment their income and help pay for the girls' Catholic school tuition.|$|E
2500|$|Insight 3 – No {{matter how}} well they have gained {{insights}} 1 and 2, insight alone rarely enables people to undo their emotional disturbances. They may feel better when they know, or think they know, how they became disturbed, because insights can feel useful and curative. But {{it is unlikely that}} people will actually get better and stay better unless <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>and</b> apply insight 3, which is that there is usually no way to get better and stay better except by continual work and practice in looking for and finding one’s core irrational beliefs; actively, energetically, and scientifically disputing them; replacing one’s absolute [...] "musts" [...] (rigid requirements about how things should be) with more flexible preferences; changing one's unhealthy feelings to healthy, self-helping emotions; and firmly acting against one’s dysfunctional fears and compulsions. Only by a combined cognitive, emotive, and behavioral, as well as a quite persistent and forceful attack on one's serious emotional problems, is one likely to significantly ameliorate or remove them, and keep them removed.|$|E
2500|$|... "Usually, the 'supercouple' {{turns out}} to be the main hero and heroine of the game, though this is not always the case." [...] The Lunar series, for example, has become famous for {{creating}} several romantic pairings from the hero's party in addition to the hero and heroine. In a role-playing plot, often the romantic feelings the characters feel for one another somehow becomes entwined with the main plot itself. In Grandia, Justin, the main character, is compelled to fight against seemingly insurmountable odds in order to rescue the girl that he is in love with. In Tales of Legendia, the romantic feelings Shirley has for main character and brother in law Senel is a focus of the game, even though the latter seems oblivious of the former's true feelings even after they are accidentally engaged in the ending of the primary story mode. [...] "When the love between the supercouple somehow becomes threatened by the machinations of the antagonist, the heroes fight back with everything <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>and</b> usually prove, once and for all, that 'love conquers all.'" ...|$|E
