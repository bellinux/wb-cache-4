5|$|Home {{propagation}} is best {{performed by}} using offset bulbils. Commercially, only cultivars that produce {{at least three}} bulbils on the mother bulb are used for this form of propagation. Plants grown from this method take {{three to four years}} <b>to</b> <b>bloom.</b>|$|E
5|$|Seed {{multiplication}} may be {{used for}} the development of new cultivars or to increase the yield of native species. Seeds are generally sown in early summer in seedbeds, and then transplanted to larger containers. They require warmth frequent watering, and should not be given a dormant period. Seeds do not breed true. Plants obtained from seeds take about six years <b>to</b> <b>bloom.</b>|$|E
5|$|For cut flowers, bulbs {{larger than}} 12cm in size are preferred. <b>To</b> <b>bloom</b> in December, bulbs are {{harvested}} in June to July, dried, stored {{for four days}} at 34°C, two weeks at 30 and two weeks at 17–20°C and then placed in cold storage for precooling at 9 degrees for about 15–16 weeks. The bulbs are then planted in light compost in crates in a greenhouse for forcing at 13°C–15°C and the blooms appear in 19–30 days.|$|E

5|$|Groups {{and lines}} of flowers {{are present in}} each level; {{approaching}} these with the petal causes them <b>to</b> <b>bloom</b> and a new petal to trail the first. When the player approaches certain flowers or groups of flowers, changes are made to the game world. These include opening new areas, transforming dead grassy areas to bright green fields, or activating wind turbines. These changes generally result in new flowers sprouting for the player to interact with. Flying through each flower results in a musical chime that harmonizes with the music. The music itself dynamically adjusts as changes are made to the world. The more flower petals the player has trailing the lead petal, the faster the petals move. It is impossible for the player to lose a level or any progress. The game features no enemies, hit points, or time limits. A single play-through of the game takes approximately one hour.|$|E
5|$|The 12th Battalion is {{unexpectedly}} attacked {{soon after}} by Intelligent Defense Systems, a private military contractor that had secretly supported first the Lazurians, then the NRA by supplying them with {{weapons of mass}} destruction. Dr. Caulder, leader of the IDS, had taken advantage of the world's devastation to carry out horrific biological and psychological experiments that he would have been unable to undertake otherwise, such as creating and spreading a terrible new disease called the Creeper, which causes flowers <b>to</b> <b>bloom</b> from infected individuals, {{for the sole purpose of}} studying the survivor's reactions. Despite numerous demoralizing attacks by IDS and its massive bomber, the Great Owl, the battalion survives and infiltrates and brings down The Great Owl, eventually pursuing Caulder to his main laboratory and fortress, The Nest. In the end, Caulder is killed in the destruction of his lab, and the war is finally brought to an end. One year later, the village of New Hope, founded by the 12th Battalion after the conflict, begins to flourish in the new-found peace. The sun is seen rising above the nearby hills for the first time since the meteor strikes, giving hope of a brighter future.|$|E
25|$|In the east, Rudolph relates, Manicheanism {{was able}} <b>to</b> <b>bloom,</b> because the {{religious}} monopoly position previously held by Christianity and Zoroastrianism {{had been broken}} by nascent Islam. In {{the early years of}} the Arab conquest, Manicheanism again found followers in Persia (mostly amongst educated circles), but flourished most in Central Asia, to which it had spread through Iran. Here, in 762, Manicheanism became the state religion of the Uyghur Empire.|$|E

25|$|Snowdrops are hardy {{herbaceous}} {{plants that}} perennate by underground bulbs. They {{are among the}} earliest spring bulbs <b>to</b> <b>bloom,</b> although a few forms of G. nivalis are autumn flowering. In colder climates, they will emerge through snow (see illustration). They naturalise relatively easily forming large drifts. These are often sterile, found near human habitation, and also former monastic sites. The leaves die back {{a few weeks after}} the flowers have faded. Galanthus plants are relatively vigorous and may spread rapidly by forming bulb offsets. They also spread by dispersal of seed, animals disturbing bulbs, and water if disturbed by floods.|$|E

25|$|In {{the field}} of comedy, the Fringe has {{provided}} a platform that has allowed the careers of many performers <b>to</b> <b>bloom.</b> In the 1960s, {{various members of the}} Monty Python team appeared in student productions, as subsequently did Rowan Atkinson, Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie and Emma Thompson, the latter three with the 1981 Cambridge Footlights. Atkinson was at Oxford. Notable companies in the 1980s have included Complicite and the National Theatre of Brent. More recent comedy performers to have been 'discovered' include Rory Bremner, Fascinating Aïda, Reduced Shakespeare Company, Steve Coogan, Jenny Eclair, The League of Gentlemen, Flight of the Conchords, Al Murray and Rich Hall.|$|E
25|$|The {{reduction}} of sea ice has boosted {{the productivity of}} phytoplankton by about twenty {{percent over the past}} thirty years. However, the effect on marine ecosystems is unclear, since the larger types of phytoplankton, which are the preferred food source of most zooplankton, do not appear to have increased as much as the smaller types. So far, Arctic phytoplankton have not {{had a significant impact on}} the global carbon cycle. In summer, the melt ponds on young and thin ice have allowed sunlight to penetrate the ice, in turn allowing phytoplankton <b>to</b> <b>bloom</b> in unexpected concentrations, although it is unknown just how long this phenomenon has been occurring.|$|E

25|$|The {{force of}} the blast ripped most of the {{branches}} from the Survivor Tree. Glass and debris were embedded in its trunk and fire from the cars parked beneath it blackened what was left. Most thought the tree could not survive. Almost {{a year after the}} bombing, family members, survivors, and rescue workers gathered for a memorial ceremony by the tree noticed it was beginning <b>to</b> <b>bloom</b> again. The Survivor Tree now thrives, and the Outdoor Memorial design includes a mandate to feature and protect the tree. For example, one of the roots that would have been cut by the wall surrounding the tree was placed inside a large pipe so it could reach the soil beyond the wall without being damaged. The decking around the tree was raised several feet to make an underground crawlspace; workers enter through a secure hatchway and monitor the health of the tree and maintain its very deep roots.|$|E
25|$|Most bird pollinated {{flowers are}} red {{and have a}} lot of nectar. They also tend to be unscented. Flowers with generalist pollinators tend to have dilute nectar but those that have {{specialist}} pollinators such as hummingbirds or sunbirds tend to have more concentrated nectar. The nectar of ornithophilous flowers vary in the sugar composition, with hexoses being high in passerine pollinated species while those that are insect pollinated tend to be sucrose rich. Hummingbird pollinated flowers however tend to be sucrose rich. Many plants of the family Loranthaceae have explosive flowers that shower pollen on a bird that forages near it. They are associated mainly with flowerpeckers in the Dicaeidae family. In Australia, some species of Banksia have flowers that open in response to bird actions thereby reducing the wastage of pollen. In tropical dry forests in southern India, ornithophilous flowers were found <b>to</b> <b>bloom</b> mainly in the hot dry season. As many as 129 species of North American plants have evolved ornithophilous associations. Nearly a fourth of the 900 species of the genus Salvia are bird pollinated in the South African region. Tropical China and the adjacent Indochinese countries harbor relatively few bird-pollinated flowers, among them is Rhodoleia championii, a member of the Hamamelidaceae family, which at any one site can be visited and pollinated by up to seven species of nectar-foraging birds, including Japanese white-eyes (Zosterops japonicus, Zosteropidae) and fork-tailed sunbirds (Aethopyga christinae, Nectariniidae).|$|E

40|$|The {{flowers of}} Waratahs, Telopea speciosissima (family Proteaceae) are {{regularly}} harvested illegally from natural bushland, particularly close to urban {{areas such as}} the New South Wales Central Coast. The removal of Waratah blooms from the wild may have implications for the long-term survival of local populations because of the interaction between wildfire events, subsequent flowering and limited seedling recruitment opportunities. To reduce the incidence of theft, blue acrylic paint was applied <b>to</b> <b>blooms</b> <b>to</b> reduce their commercial value. The painting of blooms in 2004 did not significantly reduce the incidence of wildflower theft when compared <b>to</b> unpainted <b>blooms,</b> but overall losses were lower (27 %) than in 2003 (33 %). However, painting of blooms had a deleterious affect on fruit production on plants with multiple heads with painted blooms having significantly reduced fruit set compared <b>to</b> unpainted <b>blooms.</b> Painting of blooms had no significant effect on seed quality (seed production per fruit, seed germination or seedling vigour) when compared <b>to</b> unpainted <b>blooms.</b> The painting of Waratah <b>blooms</b> <b>to</b> reduce theft was relatively ineffective and decreased fruit production.
