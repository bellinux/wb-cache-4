Understanding {{the effect of the}} environment upon a metal ion-dendrimer system constitutes a step closer {{to the understanding of the}} liquid phase templated synthesis of metal nanoparticles. In this dissertation we have used computational techniques such as abinitio calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the complexation of Cu(II) and Pt(II) metal ions to a polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendritic polymer from structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic viewpoints. First, we analyze the local configuration of a low generation polyamidoamine dendrimer to understand the role of intramolecular interactions. Then, we examine the local configuration of dendrimer outer pockets in order to determine their capacity to encapsulate water within. Next, the complexation of Cu(II) with a small ?OH terminated dendrimer in presence of solvent and counterions is investigated. This relatively simple system gives insight on how cationic species bind within a dendrimer. The complexation of potassium <b>tetrachloroplatinate,</b> commonly used precursor salt in dendrimer templated synthesis of platinum and bimetallic platinum-containing nanoparticles, with PAMAM dendrimer has been the subject of several experimental reports.

40|$|Cyclometalation {{reactions}} {{have been}} studied intensely {{for the past few}} decades, especially those containing palladium. The factors that control the process of the C-H bond activation, however, are not yet completely understood. C-H bonds are ever-present in organic molecules, {{but the vast majority of}} them cannot be exploited for chemical reactions due to their inert and stable nature. Early attempts to activate these bonds led to very complicated mixtures of products, and therefore not an acceptable means of C-H activation due to poor selectivity. Controlling the selectivity of a reaction is one of the most important issues surrounding synthetic chemistry. It is generally recognized that aromatic C-H bonds are more likely to undergo activation by platinum complexes. However, recently it has been illustrated that there is a delicate balance between sp[superscript] 2 and sp[superscript] 3 C-H bond activation in a platinum (II) complex system.       In this study, the solvent-controlled switch of selectivity between sp[superscript] 2 and sp[superscript] 3 C-H bond activation in platinum (II) complex systems will be discussed. Ligands L 1 through L 3 were designed and synthesized to test the selectivity of cycloplatination of a reaction with potassium <b>tetrachloroplatinate</b> (II) in two different solvents, acetonitrile and glacial acetic acid. It was found that in each of the solvents used, a different isomer was produced from the complexation reaction. Reactions of L 1 through L 3 with potassium <b>tetrachloroplatinate</b> (II) in acetonitrile produced the sp[superscript] 2 substituted isomer (1 B- 3 B), while the same reaction performed in glacial acetic acid formed the sp[superscript] 3 substituted isomer (1 A- 3 A).

The kinetics for the reaction between bromide and trans-Pt(CN) 4 ClH 2 O 2 − involves a rate-determining reductive elimination of chloride, followed by a rapid {{oxidative addition}} of bromine to the formed Pt(CN) 42 −. The reactions between trans-Pt(CN) 4 BrH 2 O− and bromide or chloride {{can be described as}} halide assisted anations. The rate constant for the bromide anation is kexp = k′[Br−] 2 and for the chloride anation (in the presence of bromide) k′[Br−][Cl−] + k′' [Cl−] 2. All reactions were followed using a stopped-flow technique at 25 °C in 0. 50 M perchloric acid medium. The equilibrium constant for the redox equilibrium between Pt(CN) 42 −, iodine and Pt(CN) 4 I 22 − was determined separately to be (1. 29 ± 0. 03) × 104 M− 1. Exploratory stopped-flow experiments indicate that the oxidative addition of chlorine to PtCl 42 − is first-order with respect to both chlorine and <b>tetrachloroplatinate.</b> The experimental rate laws can be described by a reaction mechanism which resembles that introduced previously for Pt(II) -catalyzed anations and substitutions, in that both mechanisms can be considered as oxidative additions/reductive eliminations...|$|E
30|$|Single-crystalline n-type Si wafers (CZ, (100), ca. 1 Ω cm, 0.5 -mm thick, Yamanaka Semiconductor Co. Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) were washed with acetone and etched with a CP- 4 A {{solution}} (a {{mixture of}} HF, nitric acid, acetic acid, and water (3 : 5 : 3 : 22 in volume)) {{and then with}} a 7.3 -M (M[*]=[*]mol[*]dm− 3) HF solution. Nanoparticles of noble metals (silver (Ag), gold (Au), platinum (Pt), and rhodium (Rh)) were deposited on the Si by electroless displacement deposition [22]. The Si wafers were immersed in a metal salt (silver nitrate (AgNO 3), tetrachloroauric (III) acid (HAuCl 4), hexachloroplatinic (IV) acid (H 2 PtCl 6), potassium <b>tetrachloroplatinate</b> (II) (K 2 PtCl 4), or rhodium chloride (RhCl 3)) solution including 0.15 -M HF. For metal-assisted HF etching, the metal particle-deposited n-Si wafers were immersed in a 7.3 -M HF solution at 298 [*]K of solution temperature for 24 [*]h. The oxygen concentration of the HF solution was controlled by gas bubbling of oxygen and argon (Ar, > 99.9999 % purity, Grade- 1, Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corp., Tokyo Japan). To avoid the influence of the photogenerated charges, the Si wafers were immersed in the HF solution under dark conditions. The rate of etching was measured by a gravimetric procedure using an analytical balance (XP 2 U, Mettler-Toledo International Inc., Columbus, OH, USA). Surface and cross-sectional inspections of the specimens were performed with scanning electron microscopes (SEM, JSM- 7001 [*]F, JEOL Ltd., Akishima, Tokyo, Japan). Electrochemical measurement was carried out with an electrochemical analyzer (VSP, Bio-logic Science Instruments, Claix, France) using a metal wire (0.12 [*]mm in diameter) working electrode, a silver-silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) reference electrode, and a Pt counter electrode. The potential sweep at a rate of 20 [*]mV s− 1 started from the rest potential to the negative potential direction.|$|E
