In addition to approaching Guadalcanal {{with the objective of}} engaging any Japanese ships <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>come</b> into range, the U.S. task force was protecting an Allied transport ship convoy carrying replacement troops there.|$|E
5|$|Palsgraf {{came to the}} {{attention}} of the legal world quickly. Dean William L. Prosser of the University of California Law School wrote that the Appellate Division's decision fell into the hands of Professor Francis H. Bohlen of the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Bohlen was at that time the Reporter compiling the first Restatement of Torts for the American Law Institute (ALI), and Cardozo was informally one of the advisers. In that task, Bohlen was having difficulty dealing with the concept of duty of care in negligence, especially involving unforeseeable plaintiffs, and Prosser related that Cardozo was treated to a learned discussion by the other advisers of a case <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>come</b> before his court and, convinced by the arguments, used them to decide Palsgraf. Kaufman doubted this story, which was told to Prosser by Dean Young B. Smith of Columbia, noting that the only meeting of the advisers between the two appeal decisions in Palsgraf took place in New York on December 12–13, 1927, beginning only three days after the Appellate Division ruled, and the notes reveal that Cardozo was absent; the chief judge was hearing arguments all that week in Albany. Nevertheless, the discussions and materials from the Restatement compilation likely influenced Cardozo in his decision.|$|E
25|$|The rebels quickly {{took control}} of Tân Sơn Nhứt to control air traffic, and set up checkpoints and defense {{installations}} on the cities' outskirts to guard against any counterattack <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>come</b> from outside the capital. They also blew up government buildings, and {{took control of}} the national post office and radio stations. Four AD-6 fighter-bombers from the Air Force roared above the city centre, adding to the confusion and threatening loyalist positions.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of the primary election, Combs {{publicly}} challenged Stephenson to a debate, to be televised on Kentucky Educational Television. Stephenson declined, citing a state judicial code forbidding candidates for judicial offices to discuss positions on issues <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>come</b> before them if elected. Combs maintained that this code violated the state constitution and the federal Constitution and refused to abide by it. He charged that Stephenson had too often sided with wealthy litigants over poorer ones including denying compensation to injured workers and upholding prohibitions on felons owning firearms, which Combs said violated the Second Amendment. Following an investigation, the Kentucky Judicial Retirement and Removal Commission ordered him suspended from the bench for three months without pay for violating the code in February 1990. Combs appealed on grounds that the code abridged his First Amendment right to free speech. The suspension was not carried out pending the outcome of Combs' appeal, and it was overturned in a case that ultimately was affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E

Aguilar was sent as visitador (inspector), specifically charged with investigating the religious topics <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>come</b> up in Cortés's residencia.|$|E

2500|$|Meir {{approved}} {{full scale}} mobilizing but sided with Dayan against a preemptive strike, citing Israel's need for foreign aid. She believed that Israel could {{not depend on}} European countries to supply Israel with military equipment, and the only country <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>come</b> to Israel's assistance was the United States. Fearing that the United States would be wary of intervening if Israel were perceived as initiating the hostilities, Meir decided early on October 6 against a preemptive strike. She made it a priority to inform Washington of her decision. U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger later confirmed Meir's assessment by stating that if Israel had launched a preemptive strike, Israel would not have received [...] "so much as a nail".|$|E
2500|$|As Esther {{moved up}} in the convent hierarchy, she took on more responsibilities. She progressed from class mistress, to {{principal}} of the boarding school and mistress of the novices. In 1726, Esther became a religieuse vocale which meant she could vote in the assembly and became [...] "Mother Marie-Joseph de l'Enfant Jésus." [...] In 1747, Esther received correspondence from her mother stating {{that her father had}} died. In his will he left money for Esther and instructions for her brothers {{to take care of her}} should she ever return to Wells, indicating her parents' enduring hope for her return, even after many decades of religious commitment. After her parents' deaths, Esther's brothers maintained correspondence with their sister in Quebec, acknowledging the benefits <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>come</b> with having a contact in New France.|$|E
2500|$|... "Now Judas {{celebrated the}} festival of the {{restoration}} of the sacrifices of the temple for eight days, and omitted no sort of pleasures thereon; but he feasted them upon very rich and splendid sacrifices; and he honored God, and delighted them by hymns and psalms. Nay, they were so very glad at the revival of their customs, when, after a long time of intermission, they unexpectedly had regained the freedom of their worship, that they made it a law for their posterity, that they should keep a festival, on account of {{the restoration of}} their temple worship, for eight days. And from that time to this we celebrate this festival, and call it Lights. I suppose the reason was because this liberty beyond our hopes appeared to us; and that thence was the name given to that festival. Judas also rebuilt the walls round about the city, and reared towers of great height against the incursions of enemies, and set guards therein. He also fortified the city Bethsura, that it might serve as a citadel against any distresses <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>come</b> from our enemies." ...|$|E
