5|$|Schmerber {{submitted}} {{an appeal}} to the Supreme Court of the United States, which granted certiorari on January 17, 1966. In his brief, Schmerber argued, inter alia, that the warrantless blood test violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unlawful searches and seizures, as well as his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The Los Angeles City Attorney's office represented the State of California on appeal. In their brief, the City Attorney argued that the blood test did not violate the Fourth Amendment because the seizure was conducted incident to a lawful arrest. The City Attorney also argued that admitting the sample into evidence did not violate Schmerber's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination because blood is not <b>testimonial</b> <b>evidence</b> under the Fifth Amendment. Oral arguments were held on April 25, 1966, and the Court issued its opinion on June 20, 1966.|$|E

500|$|Owing to the {{suppression}} by Serbia of Apis's confession {{and of the}} Salonika trial transcripts historians did not initially link Malobabić closely to the Sarajevo attack. [...] Apis's confession, however, states that [...] "I engaged Malobabić to organize the assassination {{on the occasion of}} the announced arrival of Franz Ferdinand to Sarajevo." [...] At the Salonika trial, Colonel Ljubomir Vulović (head of the Serbian Frontiers Service) testified: [...] 'In 1914 on occasion of my official trip from Loznica to Belgrade, I received a letter at the General Staff [...] noting that agents of Malobabić would come and a teacher whose name I don't recall (Danilo Ilić was a teacher but it is unclear if the teacher in question was Ilić as Ilić can be placed in Brod but not Loznica) so I could sent [...] them into Bosnia.' Because of that 'I went to Loznica and either that day or very soon afterwards sent Rade and that teacher into Bosnia.' [...] Soon thereafter occurred the Sarajevo assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand." [...] On the eve of his execution, Malobabić told a priest: [...] "They ordered me to go to Sarajevo when that assassination was to take place, and when everything was over, they ordered me to come back and fulfill other missions, and then there was the outbreak of the war." [...] Vladimir Dedijer in The Road to Sarajevo presented additional <b>testimonial</b> <b>evidence</b> that Malobabić arrived in Sarajevo on the eve of the Sarajevo attack and gave the final go ahead for the operation to Danilo Ilić. This meshes with Dedijer's theory that Djuro Ŝarac had given instructions to Ilić on 16 June cancelling the assassination. [...] Soon after their confessions, Serbia executed Malobabić, Vulović, and Apis on false charges. Serbia published no clarifications of their confessions with regards to the Sarajevo attack.|$|E

60|$|The {{evidence}} {{as to the}} occurrence of any event in past time may be ranged under two heads which, for convenience' sake, I will speak of as <b>testimonial</b> <b>evidence</b> and as circumstantial evidence.

40|$|George Campbell (1719 - 1796) is now {{recognized}} as one of the leading eighteenth-century philosophers of rhetoric, but is otherwise little known. In his own time, however, he was famous for his religious and apologetic writings, and for his leadership within the Church of Scotland. Recent scholars have attempted to examine his place within the histories of both rhetorical theory and philosophy. But they have made little effort to understand his religious thought, and have consequently failed to understand either his larger intentions or the place therein of The Philosophy of Rhetoric itself.;This study seeks to redress this imbalance by exploring the whole structure, direction and context of Campbell 2 ̆ 7 s thought. The first part of this study provides the most comprehensive overview of his life and works to date, using hitherto unexploited primary and manuscript sources. The second and third parts analyse Campbell 2 ̆ 7 s structure of thought by means of a common eighteenth-century model which divided knowledge according to its two major sources, that is, nature and revelation. Part two, which examines Campbell 2 ̆ 7 s conception of natural knowledge, surveys his theoretical contributions to common eighteenth-century philosophical issues, including Common Sense philosophy, and his practical contributions to debates concerning the uses of historical and <b>testimonial</b> <b>evidences,</b> and textual criticism. Part 3, which explores Campbell 2 ̆ 7 s conception of revealed knowledge, considers his contributions to contemporary religious thought, and his relation to eighteenth-century Scottish moderatism.;This study argues that Campbell was fully a man of the Enlightenment without being any less a sincere and pious Christian. In fact, it demonstrates that Campbell 2 ̆ 7 s Christian moderatism and apologetic strategy, like those of many of his contemporaries, were founded upon the scholarship of the Enlightenment. Nevertheless, this study also shows that Campbell directed all of his enlightened labours to thoroughly Christian ends, and that he ultimately united the natural and revealed realms of knowledge to serve those ends. If Campbell is indeed one of the Enlightenment 2 ̆ 7 s more typical representatives, as is here argued, then the Enlightenment itself cannot be viewed as inherently hostile to religion. Even Campbell 2 ̆ 7 s rhetorical theory cannot be properly understood apart from his religious teleology...|$|R

This asymmetry {{is something of a}} puzzle, for most asymmetries in criminal law favor the defendant. The asymmetry seems to disappear when physical evidence is at issue. One goal of this Essay is to understand the distinctions, or asymmetries, between monetary and nonmonetary payments, <b>testimonial</b> and physical <b>evidence,</b> and payments by the prosecution and defense. Another is to suggest ways in which law could better encourage the production of evidence, and thus the efficient reduction of crime, with a relaxation of the rule barring payment...|$|R
60|$|Suppose {{that a man}} {{tells you}} that he saw a person strike another and kill him; that is <b>testimonial</b> <b>evidence</b> of the fact of murder. But it is {{possible}} to have circumstantial evidence of the fact of murder; that is to say, you may find a man dying with a wound upon his head having exactly the form and character of the wound which is made by an axe, and, with due care in taking surrounding circumstances into account, you may conclude with the utmost certainty that the man has been murdered; that his death is the consequence of a blow inflicted by another man with that implement. We are very much in the habit of considering circumstantial evidence as of less value than <b>testimonial</b> <b>evidence,</b> and it may be that, where the circumstances are not perfectly clear and intelligible, it is a dangerous and unsafe kind of evidence; but it must not be forgotten that, in many cases, circumstantial is quite as conclusive as <b>testimonial</b> <b>evidence,</b> and that, not unfrequently, it is a great deal weightier than <b>testimonial</b> <b>evidence.</b> For example, take the case to which I referred just now. The circumstantial evidence may be better and more convincing than the testimonial evidence; for it may be impossible, under the conditions that I have defined, to suppose that the man met his death from any cause but the violent blow of an axe wielded by another man. The circumstantial evidence in favour of a murder having been committed, in that case, is as complete and as convincing as evidence can be. It is evidence which is open to no doubt and to no falsification. But the testimony of a witness is open to multitudinous doubts. He may have been mistaken. He may have been actuated by malice. It has constantly happened that even an accurate man has declared that a thing has happened in this, that, or the other way, when a careful analysis of the circumstantial evidence has shown that it did not happen in that way, but in some other way.|$|E
60|$|Now {{we have to}} {{test that}} hypothesis. For my part, I have no {{prejudice}} {{one way or the}} other. If there is evidence in favour of this view, I am burdened by no theoretical difficulties in the way of accepting it; but there must be evidence. Scientific men get an awkward habit--no, I won't call it that, for it is a valuable habit--of believing nothing unless there is evidence for it; and they have a way of looking upon belief which is not based upon evidence, not only as illogical, but as immoral. We will, if you please, test this view by the circumstantial evidence alone; for, from what I have said, you will understand that I do not propose to discuss the question of what <b>testimonial</b> <b>evidence</b> is to be adduced in favour of it. If those whose business it is to judge are not at one as to the authenticity of the only evidence of that kind which is offered, nor as to the facts to which it bears witness, the discussion of such evidence is superfluous.|$|E
60|$|There {{remains the}} third {{hypothesis}}, that of which I have spoken as {{the hypothesis of}} evolution; and I purpose that, in lectures to come, we should discuss it as carefully as we have considered the other two hypotheses. I need not {{say that it is}} quite hopeless to look for <b>testimonial</b> <b>evidence</b> of evolution. The very nature of the case precludes the possibility of such evidence, for the human race can no more be expected to testify to its own origin, than a child can be tendered as a witness of its own birth. Our sole inquiry is, what foundation circumstantial evidence lends to the hypothesis, or whether it lends none, or whether it controverts the hypothesis. I shall deal with the matter entirely as a question of history. I shall not indulge in the discussion of any speculative probabilities. I shall not attempt to show that Nature is unintelligible unless we adopt some such hypothesis. For anything I know about the matter, it may be the way of Nature to be unintelligible; she is often puzzling, and I have no reason to suppose that she is bound to fit herself to our notions.|$|E

60|$|We may now {{consider}} {{the evidence in}} favour of or against the three hypotheses. Let me first direct your attention to {{what is to be}} said about the hypothesis of the eternity of the state of things in which we now live. What will first strike you is, that it is a hypothesis which, whether true or false, is not capable of verification by any evidence. For, in order to observe either circumstantial or <b>testimonial</b> <b>evidence</b> sufficient to prove the eternity of duration of the present state of nature, you must have an eternity of witnesses or an infinity of circumstances, and neither of these is attainable. It is utterly impossible that such evidence should be carried beyond a certain point of time; and all that could be said, at most, would be, that so far as the evidence could be traced, there was nothing to contradict the hypothesis. But when you look, not to the testimonial evidence--which, considering the relative insignificance of the antiquity of human records, might not be good for much in this case--but to the circumstantial evidence, then you find that this hypothesis is absolutely incompatible with such evidence as we have; which is of so plain and simple a character that it is impossible in any way to escape from the conclusions which it forces upon us.|$|E

An alternative, negotiated rulemaking, was proposed by the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) in 1982.

40|$|In 2004, the U. S. Supreme Court held in Crawford v. Washington that {{testimonial}} hearsay is inadmissible {{at trial}} unless the declarant {{is available for}} cross-examination. Courts have subsequently struggled to define “testimonial hearsay,” but have often vaguely defined it as an out-of-court statement made for {{the primary purpose of}} establishing past events for use in future prosecution. Although Crawford intended to protect a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation, in doing so, it overlooked the holding’s detrimental effects on two particular types of victims: domestic violence and rape victims. Under Crawford, domestic violence and rape victims’ out-of-court statements are likely to be considered testimonial because the sensitive and personal nature of these incidents often results in substantial deliberation prior to any declaration, as opposed to the impromptu declarations made during so-called ongoing emergencies. In turn, these statements are likely viewed as made for future prosecution. Moreover, domestic violence and rape victims have especially compelling and uniquely fragile psychological reasons to be unavailable for cross-examination, including being at risk at for re-traumatization. Yet, despite these reasons, Crawford still places pressure on these victims to be cross-examined in front of their perpetrators because <b>testimonial</b> hearsay <b>evidence</b> is often determinative in these types of trials, and thus an unavailable victim would lead to an increased likelihood of the perpetrator escaping conviction. This sensitivity and consequential unreliability surrounding the admissibility of testimonial hearsay upon which domestic violence and rape cases rely also disincentives prosecutors from pursuing these cases, further exacerbating the unlikelihood of conviction. To alleviate the detrimental impacts that Crawford has on both victims and trials, this Article suggests that Crawford’s essential terminology must be narrowly defined, exceptions to the ruling must be expanded upon, and victims must be adequately safeguarded...|$|R
40|$|Discovery of {{evidence}} that is not available in the United States is a frequent problem in international litigation before United States courts.
