5|$|During the 1960s, {{developments}} {{in the pattern of}} oil transportation indicated that it would soon become most economical to move oil between the Middle East and Europe using ultra large crude carrier (ULCC) vessels. These vessels were so large <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to enter most of the older ports on the Atlantic Ocean, North Sea, and English Channel coasts.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, the Stones, {{following}} a suggestion by pianist Ian Stewart, put a control {{room in a}} van and created a mobile recording studio so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> limited to the standard 9–5 hours most recording studios operated by. The band lent the mobile studio out to other artists, including Led Zeppelin, which used it to record Led Zeppelin III(1970) andLed Zeppelin IV(1971).|$|E

On May 12, the organization's peacekeepers first stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> {{work with the}} nation's army if Ntaganda, the army's recently appointed deputy coordinator, {{was a part of}} it; later, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> revise their claim and announce <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> work on any operation involving the former war criminal. This negative sentiment was finally scaled down to the point where MONUC stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> [...] "sit down and take a photo with Bosco Ntaganda." ...|$|R

5|$|A {{month after}} Letcher signed the treaty, Clayton was {{replaced}} as Secretary of State by Daniel Webster. In response to concerns raised {{by one of}} the Americans hoping to construct the line of transit, Webster asked that Letcher attempt to obtain certain modifications to the treaty. Letcher brought these modifications to the Mexican diplomats, but they steadfastly refused to accept them. Letcher, speaking with the blessing of the administration, intimated that the United States would take the region by force if the requested concessions were not made. The Mexican government conceded <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to resist such action, but still refused to accept the modifications to the treaty.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, the Persian commanders were {{concerned}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able {{to defeat the}} Ionian fleet and, therefore, {{would not be able}} to take Miletus. So they sent the exiled Ionian tyrants to Lade, where each tried to persuade his fellow citizens to desert to the Persians. This approach was initially unsuccessful, but in the week-long delay before the battle, divisions arose in the Ionian camp. These divisions led to the Samians secretly agreeing to the terms offered by the Persians, but remained with the other Ionians for the time being.|$|E
5|$|In early 1855, {{less than}} twenty years after the colony was founded, South Australia's first horse tram began {{operating}} between Goolwa and Port Elliot on the Fleurieu Peninsula. Just over twenty years later Adelaide became the first city in Australia to introduce horse trams, and eventually the last to discard them for more modern public transport. Although two trials of street level trains were run, the state of Adelaide's streets, with mud in winter and dust in summer, led to the decision <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> reliable.|$|E

5|$|Rear Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane {{raised the}} first Corps of Colonial Marines in 1808 while {{commander-in-chief}} of British naval {{forces on the}} Leeward Islands station during the Napoleonic Wars. The British had captured the island of Marie Galante earlier that year, but the French governor of Guadeloupe attacked the island on hearing that illness had weakened its British garrison. Marie Galante slaves assisted the British when promised <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> returned to their proprietors; by this means, the island was preserved under British control until the arrival of three companies of the 1st West India Regiment.|$|E
5|$|After {{eight other}} {{publishers}} had rejected Philosopher's Stone, Bloomsbury offered Rowling a £2,500 advance for its publication. Despite Rowling's statement {{that she did}} not have any particular age group in mind when beginning to write the Harry Potter books, the publishers initially targeted children aged nine to eleven. On the eve of publishing, Rowling was asked by her publishers to adopt a more gender-neutral pen name in order to appeal to the male members of this age group, fearing <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> interested in reading a novel they knew to be written by a woman. She elected to use J. K. Rowling (Joanne Kathleen Rowling), using her grandmother's name as her second name because she has no middle name.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} {{speculation}} about possible successor shows, in May 2017 HBO commissioned five screenwriters – Max Borenstein, Jane Goldman, Brian Helgeland, Carly Wray and a fifth writer {{yet to be}} announced – to develop individual Game of Thrones successor series. All of the writers are to be working individually with George R. R. Martin. Martin said that all the concepts under discussion are prequels, and some may be set outside Westeros. He also ruled out Robert's Rebellion (the overthrow of Daenerys's father by Robert Baratheon) as a possible idea. D. B. Weiss and David Benioff said <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> involved {{with any of the}} projects, and want to enjoy the successor series as fans. Martin is co-writing two of the four announced scripts. In September 2017, it was announced that Game of Thrones writer Bryan Cogman would be developing a fifth prequel series.|$|E

5|$|Chambers' {{return to}} {{athletics}} took an unusual turn when he confirmed in March 2008 {{that he had}} joined English rugby league team Castleford Tigers on trial; a move which surprised and angered in equal measure given the fact he had never played the sport before. The Rugby Football League did not object to the move, {{in spite of his}} drug-damaged reputation, but stated much improvement was needed prior to any appearance for Castleford in the Super League competition. At a rugby press conference, Chambers expressed a desire to compete in the Beijing Olympics, casting doubt on his dedication to his new career. Chambers officially registered as a player with the Rugby Football League, and Martin Offiah declared that he was prepared to mentor Chambers. He completed training with the Castleford Tigers first-team squad and made his début in a reserve game against York City Knights, but Castleford announced <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> offering him a contract.|$|E
5|$|Despite many {{attendees}} at the festival, {{there were}} relatively few witnesses, and the incident {{did not cause}} any delay in the main proceedings. Journalists and others knew <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to publish any photographs or movies, so those aware of the incident did not bother recording it other than by accident, nor did any try to investigate it afterward. Most of the few photographs of the incidents have been destroyed or forgotten and lost. Siwiec was censored out of official photographs of the Central Photographic Agency (Centralna Agencja Fotograficzna), which had a monopoly on issuing photos for the press {{in the era of}} communist Poland. His act was captured in a 7-second film by a motion picture camera of the Polish Film Chronicle, but the official newsreels of the festival omitted any mention of the incident. This footage however survived, mislabeled either by accident or purpose, until it was rediscovered over twenty years later.|$|E
5|$|Following Charan Singh's resignation, Reddy summoned Chandrashekhar and Jagjivan Ram to Rashtrapati Bhavan to {{look into}} the {{possibility}} of forming an alternate government. Reddy, convinced <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to form one, accepted Singh's advice and dissolved Lok Sabha, calling for a mid term election. Singh was asked to continue as the caretaker prime minister till a new government was sworn in after the election. Reddy's decision was met with angry denunciations and protests by members of the Janata Party who even threatened to have him impeached. Although heading a caretaker government, Singh proposed as many as seven ordinances on a broad range of matters from effecting changes in company law, providing state funding of elections and reservation of jobs for the backward classes. Reddy however refused to promulgate the ordinances arguing that such momentous changes could not be made by a caretaker government.|$|E

5|$|It was {{reported}} that Rosaviakosmos had taken out an insurance policy worth 200 million US dollars to cover damage caused by falling debris. The risk of debris from the station reaching land {{was estimated to be}} 3%. Countries located near the target zone monitored events surrounding the deorbit to determine whether precautions should be taken. In New Zealand the Satellite Reentry Committee was responsible for this, whilst Emergency Management Australia handled preparations in Australia. The head of the Japanese Defense Agency, Toshitsugu Saito, postponed a trip to the United States in case any debris fell on Japan, as the station was scheduled to pass over several Japanese islands on its final orbit. Residents of Okinawa were warned to stay indoors as the station passed overhead. Members of the South Pacific Forum requested assurance from Russia <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> hit by falling debris. Chan Sek Keong, the attorney general of Singapore, called for greater regulation of space debris.|$|E
5|$|On 10 September 2013, 1FLTV {{informed}} and confirmed to Esctoday.com that Liechtenstein {{would not be}} participating at the Eurovision Song Contest 2014 in Copenhagen, Denmark. The broadcaster {{has no plans to}} join the EBU at the moment. This was confirmed again on 28 July 2014 {{in the run-up to the}} Eurovision Song Contest 2015 in Austria. 1FLTV did however state their interest in participating in the Eurovision Song Contest, but that they have to evaluate the costs of EBU membership, a necessary prelude to participation. 1FLTV confirmed that the nation will not be able to make its début in 2016, due to lack of funds to join the EBU. On 21 September 2016, 1FLTV announced <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to debut to the contest in 2017, but that they would set their eyes on a future participation once they overcome their financial hurdles.

By February 1999, Siemens had given up trying to fix the locomotives, although they had established that the main fault lay in the generators. The issue never reached the courts. On 5 May 1999, the companies announcement that they had reached an agreement for the trains to be returned to Siemens, and NOK485 million be compensated to NSB. This was in addition to NOK80 million which had already been given as discount. In addition to the purchase price, the compensation included interest and coverage for NSB's extra expenses. The locomotives were immediately dismounted of NSB-owned equipment and on 20May sent by ship to Hamburg.|$|E

5|$|The Beatles {{toured the}} Philippines in July 1966, playing two {{shows at the}} Rizal Memorial Football Stadium in Manila. Epstein unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady Imelda Marcos when {{presented}} with {{an invitation to a}} breakfast party. He had politely declined on behalf of the group, as it was their policy never to accept such official invitations. The Beatles and their entourage were ejected from their hotel on the same day and given a police escort to the airport, even though Epstein had publicly apologised for the misunderstanding in a televised statement, which was not seen or heard because of static. The entourage boarded the plane for home, but Epstein and Beatles' assistant Mal Evans were ordered off, both believing <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> allowed back on the plane. Epstein was forced to give the tax authorities £6,800 worth of Philippine peso notes earned from the Manila shows and to sign a tax bond verifying the exchange before being allowed back on the plane with Evans.|$|E
5|$|Washington was not {{a member}} of any {{political}} party and hoped <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> formed, fearing conflict that would undermine republicanism. His closest advisors formed two factions, setting the framework for the future First Party System. Secretary of Treasury Alexander Hamilton had bold plans to establish the national credit and to build a financially powerful nation, and he formed the basis of the Federalist Party. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson was the founder of the Jeffersonian Republicans, and he strenuously opposed Hamilton's agenda. Washington typically favored Hamilton over Jefferson, and it was Hamilton's agenda that went into effect. Jefferson's political actions, his support of Philip Freneau's National Gazette, and his attempt to undermine Hamilton nearly led George Washington to dismiss him from his cabinet, though he ultimately left the cabinet voluntarily. Washington never forgave him and never spoke to him again.|$|E
5|$|During the Ming Dynasty (13681644), the Mongols {{enrolled}} in military service were either originally {{prisoners of war}} or they were those who voluntarily submitted to the Ming and settled in China. Others fled their homeland on the northern steppe due to natural disasters such as droughts, seeking refuge in China where Mongol families found lodging and hospitality. Some Mongols became distinguished military officers, were granted noble ranks, and on rarer occasions became ministers in the state bureaucracy. Mongols of noble lineage socialized with Chinese literati of the two capitals (Nanjing and Beijing) while they also had their sons educated in the Chinese classic texts. Nonetheless, Mongols in the Ming Empire were often held in suspicion by Chinese Ming authorities. Mongols of lower social stature were often accused by Chinese officials of being prone to violence, banditry, and becoming beggars and even prostitutes. Ming officials used the excuse of military campaigns to relocate and scatter Mongol troops and families throughout China so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> concentrated in North China (which neighbored the enemy territory of the Mongol heartland). Wu Tingyun argues {{that there was a}} noticeable shift in Ming court policies after the 1449 Tumu Crisis in dealing with the Mongols; he stated that beforehand the Ming court actively encouraged Mongol immigration, and afterwards merely managed those who had already sided with the Ming.|$|E
