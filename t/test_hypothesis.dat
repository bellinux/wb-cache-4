5000|$|The wave of {{research}} on attributional biases done by Kahneman, Tversky and others effectively ended the dominance of Heider's naïve scientist within social psychology. Fiske and Taylor, building upon the prevalence of heuristics in human cognition, offered their theory of the cognitive miser. It is, in many ways, a unifying theory which suggests that humans engage in economically prudent thought processes, instead of acting like scientists who rationally weigh costs and benefits, <b>test</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> and update expectations based upon {{the results of the}} experiments that are our everyday actions. In other words, humans are more inclined to act as cognitive misers using mental short cuts to make assessments and decisions, about issues and ideas about which they know very little as well as issues of great salience. Fiske and Taylor argue that acting as cognitive misers is rational due to the sheer volume and intensity of information and stimuli humans intake However, other psychologists also argue that the cognitively miserly tendency of humans is a primary reason why [...] "humans are often less than rational".|$|E

Question 1 asked respondents to indicate their gender and {{it is used to}} <b>test</b> <b>hypothesis</b> H 1 by applying Independent Sample T-Test. The answer of question 1 is either Male which is coded by 1 or Female which is coded by 2. Question 2 asked respondents to indicate their age range and it is used to <b>test</b> <b>hypothesis</b> H 2 by applying One-way ANOVA Analysis. The answer for question 2 include age range from 20 to 24 coded by 1, age range from 25 to 30 coded by 2, age range from 30 to 35 coded by 3 and above 35  years old coded by 4. Question 3 asked respondents to indicate their education level and it is used to <b>test</b> <b>hypothesis</b> H 3 by running One-way ANOVA Analysis. The answer for question 3 include high school graduate coded by 1, diploma degree coded by 2, bachelor degree coded by 3 and post-graduate degree coded by 4. Question 4 asked respondents to confirm whether they have prior experience in self-employment or start-up business or not and it is used to <b>test</b> <b>hypothesis</b> H 4 by using Independent Sample T-Test. The answer for question 4 is either Yes which is coded by 1 or No which is coded by 0. Question 5 and 6 asked respondents about their family background. Question 5 asked respondents whether their parents are self-employed or not. The answer for question 5 and 6 is either Yes which is coded by 1 or No which is coded by 0. Data from question 5 is used to <b>test</b> <b>hypothesis</b> H 5 A by using Independent Sample T-Test. Question 6 asked respondents about whether their parents are immigrants from rural areas to urban city or not. Question 6 is used to <b>test</b> <b>hypothesis</b> 5 B by applying Independent Sample T-Test. Entrepreneurial intention is measured by three questions which are Question 7 “I want to start-up a business within 5 years from now”; Question 8 “Question 8 : I always want to set up my own business” and Question 9 “Becoming an entrepreneur is the most import objective of my life”. Respondents show their agreement by 7 Likert-Type scale from “ 1 strongly disagree to 7 strongly agree”. The similar research setting on entrepreneurial intention have been done by Zhao et al. (2005) and Wu (2009) in which entrepreneurial intention was measured using seven point Likert scale ranging from “ 1 strongly disagree to 7 strongly agree”. The reason to use 7 Likert scale in this study is that it would be much more rigorous to follow Linan and Chen to evaluate the level of intention by applying Likert-Type scales with 7 items because intention is generally viewed as a “complex cognitive trait” (Liñán and Chen, 2009). The average index of three questions is used for statistical analysis to <b>test</b> <b>hypothesis</b> in this study. Reliability was measured using the Cronbach’s alpha for these questions. Data analysis for this study include descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation), One-way ANOVA and Independent Sample T-test. Data analysis are conducted by IBM SPSS Statistics 20 software.|$|E

40|$|The general {{philosophy}} for bootstrap or permutation methods for <b>testing</b> <b>hypotheses</b> is {{to simulate the}} variation of the test statistic by generating the sampling distribution which assumes both that the null hypothesis is true, and that the data in the sample is somehow representative of the population. This philosophy is inapplicable for <b>testing</b> <b>hypotheses</b> for a single parameter like the population mean, since the two assumptions are contradictory (e. g., how can we assume both that {{the mean of the}} population is μ_ 0, and that the individuals in the sample with a mean M μ_ 0 are representative of the population?). The Mirror Bootstrap resolves that conundrum. The philosophy of the Mirror Bootstrap method for <b>testing</b> <b>hypotheses</b> regarding one population parameter is that we assume both that the null hypothesis is true, and that the individuals in our sample are as representative as they could be without assuming more extreme cases than observed. For example, the Mirror Bootstrap method for <b>testing</b> <b>hypotheses</b> of one mean uses a generated symmetric distribution constructed by reflecting the original sample around the hypothesized population mean μ_ 0. Simulations of the performance of the Mirror Bootstrap for <b>testing</b> <b>hypotheses</b> of one mean show that, while the method is slightly on the conservative side for very small samples, its validity and power quickly approach that of the widely used t-test. The philosophy of the Mirror Bootstrap is sufficiently general to be adapted for <b>testing</b> <b>hypotheses</b> about other parameters; this exploration is left for future research.
