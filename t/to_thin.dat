5|$|Clam dip is {{typically}} prepared using chopped or minced clams, sour cream or cream cheese, and various seasonings, and usually served chilled. It {{is used as}} a dip for potato chips, bread, crackers, and crudités. It has a creamy texture and mouthfeel. Canned, cooked, and frozen or fresh clams may be used, the latter of which can be cooked by steaming or pan cooking. Canned clams can be drained, or the liquid can be retained and used as an ingredient. After refrigeration, the dip may thicken, and the liquid from canned clams can be used <b>to</b> <b>thin</b> the dip. Milk or cream is also sometimes used <b>to</b> <b>thin</b> clam dip. When refrigerated overnight, the flavors of the ingredients intermingle more greatly, resulting in a more flavorful dip. Smoked clams are sometimes used, which imbues a distinct smoky flavor to the dip. The clams can be smoked in the shell and then minced afterward.|$|E

5|$|By 1975, {{peregrine}} falcons {{had been}} reduced to 324 pairs in North America, primarily as a result of DDT, a widely used pesticide. DDT lowered estrogen levels in female peregrines and inhibited the production of calcium, causing eggs <b>to</b> <b>thin</b> and break during incubation. Recovery efforts for the peregrine falcon have been remarkably successful: agricultural DDT was banned by the U.S. in 1972 and efforts to breed and train peregrine falcons in captivity to later release to the wild were effective. In 1999, the peregrine falcon was removed from the U.S. Endangered Species list.|$|E

40|$|Intensively managed {{loblolly pine}} (Pinus taeda L.) {{plantations}} often develop nutrient deficiencies near mid-rotation. Common silvicultural treatments for improving stand nutrition {{at this stage}} include thinning, fertilization, and vegetation control. It is important {{to better understand the}} influence of timing fertilization and vegetation control in relation <b>to</b> <b>thinning</b> as part of improving the efficiency of these practices. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effects of fertilization and vegetation control conducted within a year prior <b>to</b> <b>thinning</b> and within a year after thinning on soil N supply in mid-rotation loblolly pine plantations on a gradient of soil textures. Net N mineralization (Nmin) and exchangeable N were measured monthly. Fertilization increased annual Nmin at all sites irrespective of timing relative <b>to</b> <b>thinning,</b> with the increase more pronounced when combined with vegetation control. This finding suggests some management flexibility in the timing of mid-rotation fertilization relative <b>to</b> <b>thinning</b> for increasing soil N supply. However, the site with the highest total soil N and the lowest C:N ratio was more prone to NO 3 -N increases after fertilization conducted pre- and post-thinning. At all sites, fertilization with vegetation control promoted increases in NO 3 -N when done after thinning, which may indicate that this practice increased soil N supply to levels that exceeded stand N demand...|$|R
5|$|The {{miniature}} towers bear finer {{and more}} elegant details, indicating that architectural ideas traveled fast {{from the north}} to the south. Decoration and ornamentation had evolved from a moulded form to a chiseled form, the sharpness sometimes giving it a three-dimensional effect. The foliage decorations changed from bulky <b>to</b> <b>thin,</b> and {{a change in the}} miniature towers on dual pilasters is seen. The 11th century miniatures consisted of a cornice (kapota), a floor (vyalamala), a balustrade (vedika) and a roof (kuta) with a voluptuous moulding, while in the 12th century, detailed dravida miniature towers with many tiny tiers (tala) came into vogue. Some 12th-century temples such as the Kallesvara Temple at Hirehadagalli have miniature towers that do not stand on pilasters but instead are supported by balconies, which have niches underneath that normally contain an image of a deity.|$|E
5|$|However, Jasmine did not {{maintain}} its peak intensity {{for an extended}} period of time. By 9February, the cloud tops surrounding Jasmine began to warm, and thus weakened. In addition, the cyclone began to enter cooler SSTs. Although Jasmine's convective bands continued <b>to</b> <b>thin</b> out, the cyclone maintained a gradually expanding eyewall and remained a compact system. By 10February, the eyewall of Cyclone Jasmine measured 95km (60mi) in diameter. The next day, the subtropical ridge that had been forcing Jasmine toward the southeast had weakened, and as a result the cyclone began to track east-northeast, toward a weakness in the ridge. The storm continued to disorganize, with its eye later becoming cloud–filled. By the end of 11February, Jasmine had already weakened to a cyclone with wind speeds of just 85km/h (50mph), sustained for one minute, due to the presence of strong vertical wind shear. The low–level circulation center of Jasmine became partly exposed for a period of time on 12February, before convection redeveloped over the center. As a weakening cyclone, Jasmine only maintained an area of weak convection displaced to its east as it approached Tonga.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1940 Lindwall made his first grade rugby league debut in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership for the St. George club {{alongside}} his older brother Jack, {{who had been with}} the club since 1938. He played at fullback and assumed goal-kicking responsibilities. Lindwall's cricketing improved during the 1940–41 season, taking 34 wickets at 16.45, approximately doubling his wickets while halving their cost. By this time, many of his colleagues had enlisted in the armed services and the competition was beginning <b>to</b> <b>thin</b> out during World War II. Lindwall missed the 1941 NSWRFL season due to illness, and in doing so missed out on the team that won the premiership that season. In October 1941, Lindwall was selected to make his first-class cricket debut against Queensland in Brisbane, just after turning 20. Playing along his childhood hero McCabe, Lindwall put in a wayward performance. He conceded an expensive 81 runs in 15 wicketless overs and made just one run with the bat. The Sheffield Shield season was cancelled a month later after the December 1941 Pearl Harbor attack, that signalled the widening of the war into the Pacific arena. The Sydney grade cricket competition continued, and Lindwall helped St. George to a hat-trick of premierships with 27 wickets at 22.19 and 405 runs at 27.00.|$|E

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop {{empirical}} growth and yield models that simulate the response (volume growth) <b>to</b> <b>thinning</b> and fertilisation treatments of Douglas-fir and western hemlock stands. The models can then be used <b>to</b> evaluate different <b>thinning</b> and fertilisation strategies to gain a better understanding of responses of these species to these treatments. The literature reports many different, and sometimes conflicting, responses <b>to</b> <b>thinning</b> and fertilisation. The models that are developed and described here will allow the responses of Douglas-fir and western hemlock on coastal areas of British Columbia to be explored. Western hemlock and Douglas-fir growth after thinning and/or fertilisation can be assessed and better understood with the models.|$|R

5|$|Only D Company—which {{had been}} holding the summit and had {{withdrawn}} last—was heavily engaged {{and was unable to}} move at the scheduled time. The Chinese launched a determined assault, preceding it with heavy machine-gun and mortar fire, before attempting to overrun the forward pits. Once again the Australians repelled the Chinese assault and Gravener decided to begin <b>to</b> <b>thin</b> out his position before the situation deteriorated further. With one platoon covering their movement, D Company subsequently withdrew, closely pursued by the Chinese. During the rapid withdrawal after the final Chinese attack, Private Keith Gwyther was accidentally left behind after being knocked unconscious and buried in a forward pit by a mortar round. He regained consciousness some hours later and was subsequently captured by the Chinese who had by then occupied Hill 504 and were digging-in. Finally, the Australians succeeded in achieving a clean break after dark, and D Company was able to safely withdraw. By 23:30 the battalion was clear, completing its withdrawal in good order and intact, and suffering only minimal casualties. Regardless, the previous 24 hours of fighting had been costly for the Australians, resulting in 32 killed, 59 wounded and three captured; the bulk of them in A Company and Battalion Headquarters. Yet their stout defence had halted the assault on the brigade's right flank, and had inflicted far heavier casualties on the Chinese before being withdrawn. Significantly for the Australians 25 April was Anzac Day; however, following their successful withdrawal the Chinese turned their attention to the Canadians on the left flank.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-In 1989, lwo levels each of stand {{density and}} {{fertilization}} {{were established in}} an 8 -year-old loblolly pine (Pinus faeda L.) plantation. In March 1995, treatments were reapplied, and root elongation and carbohydrate concentrations were monitored for 2 years. Our objective was to evaluate relationships between seasonal root growth and carbohydrate concentration in response <b>to</b> <b>thinning</b> and fertilization. Peak root elongation occurred between May and July. Root elongation was greater in response <b>to</b> <b>thinning</b> throughout 1995 and, although not always significant, was consistently greater in thinned plots in 1996. Root growth was reduced in the fertilized plots throughout 1996. Positive effects of thinning on fine-root starch concentrations were observed. Starch levels were consistently lower in response to fertilization for most of 1995 but were greater in fertilized plots during winter 1996. Glucose levels tended to be greater in response <b>to</b> <b>thinning</b> both years and less in response to fertilization in 1995. We conclude that fine-root carbohydrate concentration and net root elongation are characterized by distinct seasonal patterns, and that the magnitude of seasonal root elongation and carbohydrate concentrations is influenced by silvicultural treatments...|$|R

25|$|Rose quartz {{is a type}} of quartz which {{exhibits}} a pale pink to rose red hue.

40|$|At the Swedish forest owner {{association}} Mellanskog pre-harvest planning prior <b>to</b> <b>thinning</b> {{is traditionally}} performed by company foresters.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate how the outsourcing of pre-harvest planning is perceived by the company foresters and contractors and how it affects the working environment and costs. The study showed positive experiences from foresters and contractors, though there were some responsibility issues and economic concerns. Outsourcing improves the contractor’s working environment, but deteriorates that of the foresters. Having foresters performing the pre-harvest planning is more expensive than having contractors performing it, especially on small harvesting worksites...|$|R
