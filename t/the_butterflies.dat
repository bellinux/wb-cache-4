5|$|Henry Walter Bates's 1863 book The Naturalist on the River Amazons {{describes}} his extensive {{studies of the}} insects in the Amazon basin, and especially <b>the</b> <b>butterflies.</b> He discovered that apparently similar butterflies often belonged to different families, with a harmless species mimicking a poisonous or bitter-tasting species to reduce its chance of being attacked by a predator, in the process now called after him, Batesian mimicry.|$|E
5|$|The Lycaenidae have a {{false head}} {{consisting}} of eyespots and small tails (false antennae) to deflect {{attack from the}} more vital head region. These may also cause ambush predators such as spiders to approach from the wrong end, enabling <b>the</b> <b>butterflies</b> to detect attacks promptly. Many butterflies have eyespots on the wings; these too may deflect attacks, or may serve to attract mates.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} Lepidoptera fossils {{are of a}} small moth, Archaeolepis mane, of Jurassic age, around 190 {{million years}} ago (mya). Butterflies evolved from moths, so while <b>the</b> <b>butterflies</b> are monophyletic (forming a single clade), the moths are not. The oldest butterflies are from the Palaeocene MoClay or Fur Formation of Denmark. The oldest American butterfly is the Late Eocene Prodryas persephone from the Florissant Fossil Beds.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> female <b>butterfly</b> dares her husband, and <b>the</b> <b>butterfly</b> prevaricates {{by telling}} her the king called {{him over to}} ask him not to, because he is afraid of <b>the</b> <b>butterfly.</b> <b>The</b> wife insists he stamps, and {{he goes to the}} king, who tells him he will make it happen to help control his wife, sympathizing with <b>the</b> <b>butterfly's</b> plight. <b>The</b> <b>butterfly</b> stamps and <b>the</b> palace disappears.|$|R

5|$|This {{spectacular}} moth {{is considered}} one of the most impressive and beautiful Lepidoptera, rivalling almost any of <b>the</b> <b>butterflies</b> in brilliance of colouring and form. It is featured in most coffee table books on the Lepidoptera, and is much sought after by collectors. It is collected in the wild, and raised commercially for the international butterfly trade; its wings were used to make jewellery in the Victorian era.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, <b>the</b> <b>butterflies</b> {{have been}} divided into the {{superfamily}} Papilionoidea excluding the smaller {{groups of the}} Hesperiidae (skippers) and the more moth-like Hedylidae of America. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the traditional Papilionoidea is paraphyletic {{with respect to the}} other two groups, so they should both be included within Papilionoidea, to form a single butterfly group, thereby synonymous with the clade Rhopalocera.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>butterfly</b> offers {{advantages}} over a simple straight needle. <b>The</b> <b>butterfly's</b> flexible tubing reaches more body surface and tolerates more patient movement. <b>The</b> <b>butterfly's</b> precise placement facilitates venipuncture of thin, [...] "rolling", fragile, or otherwise poorly accessible veins. <b>The</b> <b>butterfly's</b> shallow-angle insertion design facilitates venipuncture of very superficial veins, e.g. hand, wrist, or scalp veins (hence name [...] "scalp vein" [...] set).|$|R

5|$|In Dorset, Druitt {{played for}} the Kingston Park Cricket Club, and the Dorset County Cricket Club. He was {{particularly}} noted for his skill as a bowler. In 1882 and 1883, he toured the West Country with a gentleman's touring team called the Incogniti. One of Druitt's fellow local players was Francis Lacey, the first man knighted for services to cricket. Druitt played for another wandering team, <b>the</b> <b>Butterflies,</b> on 14 June 1883, when they drew against his alma mater Winchester College. The team included first-class cricketers A. J. Webbe, J. G. Crowdy, John Frederick and Charles Seymour.|$|E
5|$|Variations in the toolkit {{may have}} {{produced}} {{a large part of}} the morphological evolution of animals. The toolkit can drive evolution in two ways. A toolkit gene can be expressed in a different pattern, as when the beak of Darwin's large ground-finch was enlarged by the BMP gene, or when snakes lost their legs as distal-less became under-expressed or not expressed at all in the places where other reptiles continued to form their limbs. Or, a toolkit gene can acquire a new function, as seen in the many functions of that same gene, distal-less, which controls such diverse structures as the mandible in vertebrates, legs and antennae in the fruit fly, and eyespot pattern in butterfly wings. Given that small changes in toolbox genes can cause significant changes in body structures, they have often enabled the same function convergently or in parallel. distal-less generates wing patterns in <b>the</b> <b>butterflies</b> Heliconius erato and Heliconius melpomene, which are Müllerian mimics. In so-called facilitated variation, their wing patterns arose in different evolutionary events, but are controlled by the same genes. Developmental changes can contribute directly to speciation.|$|E
5|$|Latin American {{novels that}} explore {{political}} themes, but {{that do not}} centre upon the rule of a particular dictator, are informally classified as “not quite dictator novels”. For example, Libro de Manuel (A Manual for Manuel, 1973), by Julio Cortázar, is a postmodern novel about urban guerrillas and their revolutionary struggle, which asks the reader to examine the broader societal matters of language, sexuality, and the modes of interpretation. In the Time of <b>the</b> <b>Butterflies</b> (1994), by Julia Álvarez, {{tells the story of}} the Mirabal sisters, whom patriotism transformed from well-behaved Catholic débutantes to political dissenters against the thirty-year dictatorship of the Trujillo régime in the Dominican Republic. The novel sought to illuminate the officially-obscured-history of the deaths of the Mirabal sisters, not to determine what happened to them, but to determine how the Mirabal sisters happened to the national politics of the Dominican Republic. In the mock-diary “Intimate Diary of Solitude” (third part of El imperio de los sueños 1988; Empire of Dreams, 1994), by Giannina Braschi, the protagonist is Mariquita Samper, the diarist who shoots the narrator of the Latin American Boom in revolt against his dictatorial control of the fictional narration. Moreover, in Braschi’s most recent work “United States of Banana” (2011), the Puerto Rican prisoner Segismundo overthrows his father, the King of the United States of Banana, who had imprisoned him for more than a hundred years in the dungeon of the Statue of Liberty, for the crime of having been born. The story of Distant Star (1996), by Roberto Bolaño, begins on 11 September 1973, with the coup d’état by General Augusto Pinochet against Salvador Allende, the President of Chile. The writer and professor of literature Raymond Leslie Williams describes the aforementioned novels as not-quite-dictator-novels, which are reminiscent of the genre for being “acutely and subtly political fiction” that addresses themes different from those of the dictator novel, which cannot be divorced from the politics of the stories, and so each “can be read as a meditation on the horror of absolute power”.|$|E

50|$|Another form of defence is {{the taste}} of <b>the</b> <b>butterfly.</b> Similar to <b>the</b> monarch <b>butterfly,</b> <b>the</b> Apollo <b>butterfly</b> {{produces}} a repulsive taste to its predator. <b>The</b> <b>butterfly</b> seems to get this foul taste from its plant host, the Sedum stenopetalum. There is a bitter tasting cyanoglucoside, sarmentonsin, which is found in both <b>the</b> <b>butterfly</b> and <b>the</b> plant. There is a much higher concentration of sarmentonsin in the wings {{as opposed to the}} rest of the body. The high concentration in the wings indicates that the wings of <b>the</b> <b>butterfly</b> would taste much worse comparatively. A common predator, nesting water pipits, have evolved a strategy to avoid the poor taste of the butterfly; the bird will remove the wings before consuming the body.
