40|$|Context: Chikungunya (CHIK) fever is {{viral disease}} {{characterized}} by joint pain for prolonged duration in various settings. However, {{there are no}} reports of long-term follow-up of the CHIK patients from India. Aims: We conducted a cohort study to describe the clinical manifestations, incidence of persistent arthralgia, and the associated risk factors among patients with CHIK identified during an outbreak {{in a suburb of}} Chennai, India. Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective cum prospective cohort study in Gowripet, Avadi, Chennai. We included all adult CHIK case patients identified during the outbreak. We conducted a nested case-control study to identify the risk factors for persistent arthralgia defined as a CHIK case experiencing arthralgia for more than 15 days from the date of onset of illness. We included all 81 patients and 81 randomly selected controls. Results: All 403 case patients had joint pain. Approximately 40 % suffered joint pain for up to 1 month and 7 % had it beyond 1 year. The most commonly affected <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>joints</b> were knee (96 %), wrist (80 %), and ankle (77 %) joints. Regarding the number <b>of</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>joints</b> affected, 36 % had six <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>joints,</b> 23 % had five <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>joints,</b> and 14 % had three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>joints</b> affected. The overall incidence of persistent arthralgia was 80 %. High-grade fever, involvement of four or more <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>joints,</b> and joint swelling were significantly associated with persistent arthralgia. Conclusions: High prevalence of persistent arthralgia indicates the need for appropriate treatment strategies to reduce the severity and duration <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> pain...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} {{is focused on}} the behavior <b>of</b> a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> between hollow sections. A theoretical model is created with the finite element method simulating a beam to column joint. The member which acts as the beam or as the brace <b>of</b> the <b>joint</b> (bi) is the same <b>type</b> <b>of</b> section with the other one act as the column or the chord (bo). Both members are square hollow sections. Firstly, the effect of the shear force due to the bending moment is examined with additionally the effect or the geometric ratio (β = bi/bo) and the thickness ratio (τ = ti/to) in the resistance <b>of</b> normal <b>type</b> <b>joint.</b> According to the parametric analysis followed, the design resistances <b>of</b> these <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>joints</b> are compared to those mentioned to EC 3 and those proposed of the research study worldwide in the same <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>joints</b> under axial loads. Joints are classified according the pre-mentioned limits for open sections and the resultant moment-rotation curves. An experimental study <b>of</b> these normal <b>joints</b> is made. <b>Joints</b> <b>of</b> “X” <b>type</b> in scale 1 : 1 and geometric ratios β = 0. 66 and β = 1. 0 are examined including 4 moment type joints. In sequence, the previous <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>joints</b> are examined with the chord-column member rotated by 45 o consisting a “bird-beak” joint. With the same parametric analysis the effect the geometric ratio (β = bi/bo) and the thickness ratio (τ = ti/to) in the resistance <b>of</b> this new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> is examined. The results obtained are compared to those for normal joints and classified according to their strength and rotational stiffness. A formula is proposed for the design resistance <b>of</b> these <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>joints.</b> The behavior <b>of</b> these theoretical models which are created with fem is also compared with the experimental results <b>of</b> “b-b” “X” <b>type</b> <b>joints</b> in scale 1 : 1 and geometric ratios β = 0. 66 and β = 1. 0 including 4 new moment type joints. ...|$|R

50|$|Cartilage is a thin, elastic {{tissue that}} protects the bone and makes certain that the joint {{surfaces}} can slide easily over each other. Cartilage ensures supple knee movement. There are two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> cartilage in the knees: fibrous cartilage (the meniscus) and hyaline cartilage. Fibrous cartilage has tensile strength and can resist pressure. Hyaline cartilage covers the surface along which the joints move. Cartilage will wear over the years. Cartilage has a very limited capacity for self-restoration. The newly formed tissue will generally consist of {{a large part of}} fibrous cartilage of lesser quality than the original hyaline cartilage. As a result, new cracks and tears will form in the cartilage over time.|$|E

If the joint account is a survivorship account, the ownership of the account goes to the surviving joint account holder. Joint survivorship accounts are often created in order to avoid probate.

40|$|In this research, an {{experimental}} method {{for measuring the}} clamping force {{as a result of}} tightening torque in double lap simple bolted and hybrid (bolted-bonded) joints is proposed. Two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>joints,</b> i. e. double lap simple and hybrid (bolted-bonded) joints were prepared for testing. In order to measure the clamping force or pretension resulting from the tightening torque at different applied torques, for both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>joints,</b> a special experimental method was designed using a steel bush that was placed between the nut and the plate. Two strain gauges were stuck to the outer surface of the bush to measure the compressive axial strain and also the stress in the bush using Hooke’s law. Finally, the axial force in the bush and subsequently the clamping force were determined. The test was repeated three times for each case to obtain the mean value of compressive strains and to determine the corresponding clamping forces. The relationship between the applied tightening torques and the mean value of compressive strains for both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>joints</b> are shown in graphs...|$|R

Rather, when the states interpose and declare a federal law unconstitutional, these declarations [...] "are expressions of opinion, unaccompanied with any other effect than what they may produce on opinion, by exciting reflection. The expositions of the judiciary, on the other hand, are carried into immediate effect by force."
