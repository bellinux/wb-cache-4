5|$|The Commission {{spent much}} of 1907 {{investigating}} the railroads and other companies owned by Edward H. Harriman, holding hearings across the country. In October, Lane determined that <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Pacific</b> Railroad, one of Harriman's lines, was engaged in rebating, a practice of effectively giving special rates to favored shippers that had been outlawed by the Hepburn Act.|$|E

5|$|Progress M1-5, {{which had}} {{originally}} been built to resupply and refuel either Mir or the International Space Station, was selected to perform the deorbit manoeuvre. Its mission earned it the nickname Hearse. It was a Progress-M1 11F615A55 spacecraft, with the serial number 254. An uninhabited area of <b>the</b> <b>southern</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean was selected for the station to be deorbited into, as had been done with five earlier Salyut spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|The {{purchase}} included lands {{south of}} the Gila River and west of the Rio Grande which the U.S. acquired {{so that it could}} construct a transcontinental railroad along a deep southern route, which <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Pacific</b> Railroad later completed in 1881/1883. The purchase also aimed to reconcile outstanding border issues between the U.S. and Mexico following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the earlier Mexican–American War of 1846–1848.|$|E

When Mark was five years old, his maternal grandmother took over the household while his mother, Dovie attended Oregon State College (now Oregon State University) and graduated with a teaching degree after four years. Dovie taught school in Dallas {{for two years before}} the family moved to Salem, where she taught junior high school.|$|E
2500|$|Well known were <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Pacific's</b> unique [...] "cab-forward" [...] steam {{locomotives}}. These were 2-8-8-4 locomotives {{set up to}} run in reverse, {{with the}} tender attached to the smokebox end of <b>the</b> locomotive. <b>Southern</b> <b>Pacific</b> {{had a number of}} snow sheds in mountain terrain, and locomotive crews nearly asphyxiated from smoke in the cab. After a number of engineers began running their engines in reverse (pushing <b>the</b> tender), <b>Southern</b> <b>Pacific</b> asked Baldwin Locomotive Works to produce cab-forward designs. No other North American railroad ordered cab-forward locomotives.|$|R

5|$|On May 20, 1880 the Carson and Colorado Railway was formed, {{with the}} intent of {{extending}} a rail line from the existing Virginia and Truckee Railroad at Hawthorne, Nevada through the Owens Valley towards the Colorado River. Though the rail line was never finished, it did bring economic development to the valley. The railroad was never completed past Keeler on the shores of Owens Lake. This line was acquired by <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Pacific</b> Railroad in 1900. There were plans to connect this narrow gauge line with SP's standard gauge lines in the area, however these plans never materialized and the narrow gauge line was scrapped in 1959.|$|E
5|$|SS El Oriente was a {{cargo ship}} built in 1910 for the Morgan Line, a {{subsidiary}} of <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Pacific</b> Company. During World War I, she was known as USS El Oriente (ID-4504) in service with the United States Navy. At the end of war, she reverted to her original name of SS El Oriente. During World War II she was chartered by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) as SS Henri Dunant (sometimes also spelled Henry Dunant), but reverted to her original name of SS El Oriente {{at the end of}} the charter.|$|E
5|$|The California Highway Commission {{considered}} several easterly routes between Saugus and Gorman: Soledad Canyon (used by <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Pacific)</b> had frequent washouts; Mint Canyon (used by the Midway Route) was {{too long}} and cost too much; Bouquet Canyon (used by both automobile routes) had bad drainage; and San Francisquito Canyon (used by the Tejon Pass Route) was steep and narrow. Another possible route, through Piru Canyon to the west, was rejected because of {{a proposal for a}} dam. This route was later chosen for the Ridge Route Alternate, but had to be abandoned in the 1970s due to the construction of Pyramid Lake.|$|E

5|$|The MFR's {{estimate}} of peak 10-minute sustained winds of 250km/h (155mph) made Fantala the strongest tropical cyclone on {{record in the}} south-west Indian Ocean by that measure. According to estimates from the JTWC, Fantala attained peak 1-minute sustained winds of 285km/h (180mph), surpassing Cyclone Agnielle from November 1995 as the strongest cyclone on record in the south-west Indian Ocean. Reliable satellite-based intensity estimates date back to 1990. The storm was fueled by the powerful 2014–16 El Niño event, which {{also contributed to the}} record intensities of Hurricane Patricia in the northeastern Pacific Ocean and Cyclone Winston in <b>the</b> <b>southern</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Pacific</b> Railroad from Los Angeles reached Yuma, Arizona, in 1877, Tucson in March 1880, El Paso in May 1881, {{and thus}} {{completed}} the second transcontinental railroad in December 1881. The portion in Arizona was originally {{largely in the}} Gadsden Purchase but the western part was later rerouted north of the Gila River to serve the city of Phoenix. The portion in New Mexico runs largely through the territory that had been disputed between Mexico and the United States after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo had gone into effect, and before {{the time of the}} Gadsden Purchase. The Santa Fe Railroad Company also completed a railroad across Northern Arizona, via Prescott, Winslow, Flagstaff and Kingman in August 1883.|$|E
5|$|The {{two general}} routes {{followed}} by the Butterfield Overland Stage and <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Pacific</b> Railroad—known respectively as the Tejon Pass Route and the Tehachapi or Midway Route – were the main automobile routes between Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley around {{the start of the}} 20th century. The State Bureau of Highways recommended in 1895 that a more direct route be built to shorten this distance. A bond issue was approved in 1909 and 1910 to build a state highway system, including the Ridge Route. The new California Highway Commission was unable to raise funds in the East, but Los Angeles again contributed funds to ensure that construction would go forward.|$|E

5|$|When built, the {{surrounding}} area was composed of dirt roads and private residences. <b>The</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Pacific</b> Railroad's 1868 west side rail line ran down Fourth Avenue past City Hall and the county courthouse. The city and county governments fought the railroad to remove the dirty and noisy steam locomotives from this route, succeeding in 1912. Southern Pacific's electric interurban line continued on the tracks until the 1930s. In 2007, work began on adding light rail tracks on Fifth Avenue for the planned MAX Green Line, and trains once again ran past City Hall starting in 2009.|$|E
5|$|As the United States {{developed}} the Southwest, the Colorado River {{was seen as}} a potential source of irrigation water. An initial attempt at diverting the river for irrigation purposes occurred in the late 1890s, when land speculator William Beatty built the Alamo Canal just north of the Mexican border; the canal dipped into Mexico before running to a desolate area Beatty named the Imperial Valley. Though water from the Imperial Canal allowed for the widespread settlement of the valley, the canal proved expensive to maintain. After a catastrophic breach that caused the Colorado River to fill the Salton Sea, <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Pacific</b> Railroad spent $3million in 1906–07 to stabilize the waterway, an amount it hoped vainly would be reimbursed by the Federal Government. Even after the waterway was stabilized, it proved unsatisfactory because of constant disputes with landowners on the Mexican side of the border.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{easy access to the}} ranch and any lodging in the area, {{tourists}} flocked to this site. The 1887 completion of <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Pacific</b> line increased the number of visitors, as the railroad featured the ranch in its advertisements in order to distinguish the line from its competitors. Although the ranch was not developed for tourism, the Del Valles, with their Californio sense of hospitality, would lodge the visitors. By October 1888, housing visitors was getting to be so expensive for the family that Reginaldo del Valle pressed his mother to stop being so hospitable. The tourists could be quite a nuisance, and unscrupulous visitors would steal items from the house as souvenirs, or help themselves to fruit from the orchards.|$|E
