5|$|Exposure to oxygen (diradical) {{converts}} this carbene to {{the corresponding}} benzophenone and the diphenylmethane compound is formed {{when it is}} trapped by 1,4-cyclohexadiene. As with the other carbenes this species contains large bulky substituents, namely bromine and the <b>trifluoromethyl</b> groups, that shield the carbene and prevent or slow down the process of dimerisation to a 1,1,2,2-tetra(phenyl)alkene.|$|E
5|$|Polymers {{exhibit the}} same {{stability}} increases afforded by fluorine substitution (for hydrogen) in discrete molecules; their melting points generally increase too. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), the simplest fluoropolymer and perfluoro analogue of polyethylene with structural unit , demonstrates this change as expected, but its very {{high melting point}} {{makes it difficult to}} mold. Various PTFE derivatives are less temperature-tolerant but easier to mold: fluorinated ethylene propylene replaces some fluorine atoms with <b>trifluoromethyl</b> groups, perfluoroalkoxy alkanes do the same with trifluoromethoxy groups, and Nafion contains perfluoroether side chains capped with sulfonic acid groups. Other fluoropolymers retain some hydrogen atoms; polyvinylidene fluoride has half the fluorine atoms of PTFE and polyvinyl fluoride has a quarter, but both behave much like perfluorinated polymers.|$|E
5|$|About 30% of agrichemicals contain fluorine, {{most of them}} {{herbicides}} and fungicides with a few crop regulators. Fluorine substitution, usually of {{a single}} atom or at most a <b>trifluoromethyl</b> group, is a robust modification with effects analogous to fluorinated pharmaceuticals: increased biological stay time, membrane crossing, and altering of molecular recognition. Trifluralin is a prominent example, with large-scale use in the U.S. as a weedkiller, {{but it is a}} suspected carcinogen and has been banned in many European countries. Sodium monofluoroacetate (1080) is a mammalian poison in which two acetic acid hydrogens are replaced with fluorine and sodium; it disrupts cell metabolism by replacing acetate in the citric acid cycle. First synthesized in the late 19th century, it was recognized as an insecticide in the early 20th, and was later deployed in its current use. New Zealand, the largest consumer of 1080, uses it to protect kiwis from the invasive Australian common brushtail possum. Europe and the U.S. have banned 1080.|$|E
25|$|The {{story of}} pantoprazole's {{discovery}} {{is a good}} example of the stepwise development of PPIs. The main focus of modification of timoprazole was the benzimidazole part of its structure. Addition of a <b>trifluoromethyl</b> group to the benzimidazole moiety led to a series of very active compounds with varying solution-stability. In general fluoro substituents were found to block metabolism at the point where they were attached. Later the more balanced fluoroalkoxy substituent, instead of the highly lipophilic and strongly electron-withdrawing <b>trifluoromethyl</b> substituent, led to highly active compounds with supposed longer half-lives and higher solution stability.|$|E
25|$|The UNiversal EXtraction {{process was}} {{developed}} in Russia and the Czech Republic; {{it is designed to}} completely remove the most troublesome radioisotopes (Sr, Cs and minor actinides) from the raffinate remaining after the extraction of uranium and plutonium from used nuclear fuel. The chemistry is based upon the interaction of caesium and strontium with polyethylene glycol) and a cobalt carborane anion (known as chlorinated cobalt dicarbollide). The actinides are extracted by CMPO, and the diluent is a polar aromatic such as nitrobenzene. Other dilents such as meta-nitrobenzotrifluoride and phenyl <b>trifluoromethyl</b> sulfone have been suggested as well.|$|E
25|$|Hydroxyflutamide and its analogues, {{bicalutamide}} and nilutamide, {{share an}} anilide ring structure. The structures {{can be seen}} in figure 7, where the anilide ring is coloured red. These three compounds require an electron-deficient aromatic ring for efficient AR binding. Replacing the anilide with an alkene gives weakly active compounds, which {{can be attributed to the}} lack of intramolecular hydrogen binding or to poor hydrogen-bond donor capability. Various combinations of electron-withdrawing substitutions in the aniline ring of these drugs have not shown higher binding to the AR receptor, compared to compounds which have a chloro or <b>trifluoromethyl</b> group at the meta position (R1) and either a cyano or nitrogen group at the para position (R2).|$|E
2500|$|The {{development}} of organofluorine chemistry has contributed many reagents of value beyond organofluorine chemistry. Triflic acid (CF3SO3H) and trifluoroacetic acid (CF3CO2H) are useful throughout organic synthesis. [...] Their strong acidity {{is attributed to}} the electronegativity of the <b>trifluoromethyl</b> group that stabilizes the negative charge.

2500|$|Fluorocarbons {{with few}} C-F bonds behave {{similarly}} {{to the parent}} hydrocarbons, but their reactivity can be altered significantly.

[...] The use of the C-F bond in pharmaceuticals is predicated on this altered reactivity. [...] Several drugs and agrochemicals contain only one fluorine center or one <b>trifluoromethyl</b> group.|$|E
2500|$|Many organofluorine {{compounds}} {{are generated}} from reagents that deliver perfluoroalkyl and perfluoroaryl groups.

[...] Among the available fluorinated building blocks are CF3X (X = Br, I), C6F5Br, and C3F7I. [...] These species form Grignard reagents that then can be treated with a variety of electrophiles.
