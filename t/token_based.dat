The <b>Token</b> <b>Based</b> Networking allows binding of applications ’ traffic from end-nodes (e. g., IP packets in a campus network) to end-to-end lightpaths (e. g., GMPLS circuits). In other words, the <b>Token</b> <b>Based</b> Networking architecture establishes authorised paths over multiple network domains on behalf of the end-nodes applications. The <b>Token</b> <b>Based</b> Switch is a programmable hardware and software system that processes IP packets at high speeds (multi-gigabits/sec). We designed and built our gateway router that operates at IP layer (TBS-IP) by using specialised hardware (network processors) programmable by higher-level software through a standard protocol: ForCES. ForCES is a new protocol designed by IETF, nearing the point of being RFC, which separates the Forwarding and the Control planes in a traffic processing system. ForCES provides a scalable way to configure and manage the Forwarding Plane using a standard protocol.

30|$|We will compare our {{proposed}} mechanism against {{nine other}} traffic policing mechanisms, i.e., the seven mechanisms mentioned above plus two more {{versions of the}} Token Bucket mechanism.

The idea is that allowing the policer to generate <b>tokens</b> simply <b>based</b> on the mean rate of the source may be insufficient for bursty multimedia sources. Therefore, we combine the functionality of the token bucket with video traffic models which are better tailored to capture the burstiness of a video user’s traffic. The two additional traffic policing mechanisms are the TB-GBAR, where <b>tokens</b> are generated <b>based</b> on the gamma-beta auto-regression (GBAR) model [35] and the TB-SARIMA, where <b>tokens</b> are generated <b>based</b> on the seasonal ARIMA model [13].|$|R
