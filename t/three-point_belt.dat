5000|$|A 3-point belt is a Y-shaped arrangement, {{similar to}} the {{separate}} lap and sash belts, but unitized. Like the separate lap-and-sash belt, in a collision the 3-point belt spreads out {{the energy of the}} moving body over the chest, pelvis, and shoulders. Volvo introduced the first production <b>three-point</b> <b>belt</b> in 1959. The first car with a <b>three-point</b> <b>belt</b> was a Volvo PV 544 that was delivered to a dealer in Kristianstad on August 13, 1959. However, the first car model to feature the three-point seat belt as a standard item was the 1959 Volvo 122, first outfitted with a two-point belt at initial delivery in 1958, replaced with the three-point seat belt the following year. The <b>three-point</b> <b>belt</b> was developed by Nils Bohlin who had earlier also worked on ejection seats at Saab. [...] Volvo then made the new seat belt design patent open in the interest of safety and made it available to other car manufacturers for free.|$|E
50|$|In 1955 (as a 1956 package), Ford offered lap only {{seat belts}} {{in the rear}} seats as an option within the Lifeguard safety package. In 1967, Volvo started to install lap belts in the rear seats. In 1972, Volvo {{upgraded}} the rear seat belts to a <b>three-point</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E
50|$|This has {{led many}} {{countries}} to adopt mandatory seat belt wearing laws. It is generally accepted that, in comparing like-for-like accidents, a vehicle occupant not wearing a properly fitted seat belt has a significantly and substantially higher chance of death and serious injury. One large observation studying using US data showed that the odds ratio of crash death is 0.46 with a <b>three-point</b> <b>belt,</b> when compared with no belt. In another study that examined injuries presenting to the ER pre- and post-seat belt law introduction, {{it was found that}} 40% more escaped injury and 35% more escaped mild and moderate injuries.|$|E
40|$|Results of the swov-accident {{investigation}} {{prove that}} {{if there are any}} differences in the effectiveness of lap <b>belts</b> and <b>three-point</b> <b>belts,</b> these are so small that they cannot form a basis for giving preference to one type over the other. Furthermore, in spite of the results of this investigation which show some disadvantageous effects of diagonal belts (as compared to lap <b>belts</b> and <b>three-point</b> <b>belts),</b> involving a higher injury risk, which leads to the conclusion that general use of this type should not be favoured, a complete comdemnation of diagonal belts seems exaggerated. The effectiveness percentages of both lap <b>belts</b> and <b>three-point</b> <b>belts</b> show independently very high values. It is justifiable to draw the conclusion that both lap <b>belts</b> and <b>three-point</b> <b>belts</b> are highly effective measures for safety in traffic.

40|$|Use of seatbelts in late model {{cars with}} {{automatic}} or manual belt systems {{was observed in}} suburban Washington, DC, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia. In cars with automatic two-point belt systems, the use of shoulder belts by drivers was substantially {{higher than in the}} same model cars with manual <b>three-point</b> <b>belts.</b> This finding was true in varying degrees whatever the type of automatic belt, including cars with detachable nonmotorized belts, cars with detachable motorized belts, and especially cars with nondetachable motorized belts. Most of these automatic shoulder belts systems include manual lap belts. Use of lap belts was lower in cars with automatic two-point belt systems than in the same model cars with manual three-point belts; precisely how much lower could not be reliably estimated in this survey. Use of shoulder and lap belts was slightly higher in General Motors cars with detachable automatic <b>three-point</b> <b>belts</b> compared with the same model cars with manual three-point belts; in Hondas {{there was no difference in}} the rates of use of manual <b>three-point</b> <b>belts</b> and the rates of use of automatic <b>three-point</b> <b>belts...</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{lap belt}} is a strap that {{goes over the}} waist. This was the most {{commonly}} installed type of belt prior to legislation requiring 3-point belts, and is primarily found in older cars. Coaches are equipped with lap belts (although many newer coaches have <b>three-point</b> <b>belts),</b> as are passenger aircraft seats.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to designing an effective <b>three-point</b> <b>belt,</b> Bohlin demonstrated its effectiveness {{in a study}} of 28,000 accidents in Sweden, and presented a paper at the 11th Stapp Car Crash Convention. Unbelted occupants sustained fatal injuries throughout the whole speed scale, whereas none of the belted occupants was fatally injured at accident speeds below 60 mph. No belted occupant was fatally injured if the passenger compartment remained intact. This study resulted in the U.S. Department of Transportation requiring three-point seat belts in American cars. In 1968, the new seat belt design was made free for the public to use. In most industrial countries, occupants are required by law to use seat belts.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{the first}} modern {{three point seat belt}} (the {{so-called}} CIR-Griswold restraint) used in most consumer vehicles today was patented in 1955 [...] by the Americans Roger W. Griswold and Hugh DeHaven. Fatal car accidents were rapidly increasing in Sweden during the 1950s. When a study at Vattenfall of accidents among employees revealed that the majority of casualties came from car accidents, two Vattenfall engineers (Bengt Odelgard and Per-Olof Weman) started to develop the safety belt. Their work set the standard for safety belts in Swedish cars and was presented to Swedish manufacturer Volvo in the late 1950s. The 3-point seatbelt was developed to its modern form by Swedish inventor Nils Bohlin for Volvo - who introduced it in 1959 as standard equipment. In addition to designing an effective <b>three-point</b> <b>belt,</b> Bohlin demonstrated its effectiveness in a study of 28,000 accidents in Sweden. Unbelted occupants sustained fatal injuries throughout the whole speed scale, whereas none of the belted occupants were fatally injured at accident speeds below 60 mph.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the crash {{exposure}} patterns of pregnant occupants and to evaluate the effectiveness of restraint systems, including four-point seatbelts, in far side crashes. The NASS CDS database revealed that 53. 0 % of pregnant occupants are exposed to frontal crashes while 13. 5 % are exposed to far side impacts. Given that far side crashes were the second leading crash mode after frontal impacts, a previously validated MADYMO computer model of a 30 week pregnant occupant was utilized to investigate pregnant occupant biomechanics in far side crashes. Three impact speeds (5, 15, and 25 mph) were simulated with four restraint conditions: unbelted, lap-belt only, <b>three-point</b> <b>belt,</b> and a four-point belt. Direct abdominal contact from the shoulder strap of the three-point or four-point belt caused uterine-placental strain in contrast to the inertial loading induced strain in the lap-belt and unbelted cases. Overall, the three-point and four-point belt systems provide superior restraint effectiveness for the pregnant occupant compared to the lap-belt and no restraint cases. The four-point resulted in slightly better performance than the <b>three-point</b> <b>belt</b> by reducing the fetal injury risk and occupant excursion...|$|E

40|$|A revised {{brochure}} {{is presented}} {{which is designed}} to stimulate the use of safety belts. After an introduction questions on the need for safety belts. The best type of belt and the connect wearing of the belt are answered. The effectiveness of the different types of restraint systems, <b>three-points</b> <b>belts,</b> diagonal belts, lap belts and head rests is discussed.

40|$|There is an {{increased}} risk of the shoulder belt slipping off in certain crash configurations, resulting in sub-optimal protection. An extra seat belt would improve the restraint system. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify children’s and adult’s attitudes toward extra seat belts added to the <b>three-point</b> <b>belt</b> in the rear seat of a passenger car. Five focus groups were conducted with 11 Swedish children (8 - 10 years), and 18 adults. Two concepts were studied, the Backpack with an extra belt over the inboard shoulder, and the Criss-Cross with an extra belt across the torso. The results showed that seat belt usage was not questioned. The <b>three-point</b> <b>belt</b> was experienced as very safe, and extra seat belts were considered to further increase safety. Both concepts were accepted, but Criss-Cross was preferred due to greater perceived safety and comfort. Discomfort occurred in both concepts due to chafing at the neck, extra pressure on the upper body, and reduced ability to move. In conclusion, extra seat belts were in line with children’s current attitudes toward car safety, while adults were more hesitant. Increased understanding of user attitudes provides input to future restraint system design, resulting in attractive systems with improved restraint function...|$|E
40|$|Over 17, 000 non-struck or {{far side}} {{occupants}} in side and rollover crashes are seriously or fatally injured {{annually in the}} US. Although no legal or rating tests exist for far side crashes, test methods including appropriate dummies as well as countermeasures have been recently suggested. The {{aim of this study}} was to establish the incidence and risk of injury/fatality as a function of vehicle change in velocity (Δv) for the most frequent injuries of belted, far side occupants in side impacts. The study was based upon the NASS/CDS 1995 – 2006 records of 5, 653 occupants exposed to a far side crash. 401 of these were seriously or fatally injured. Combining this data with new and previously published crash test results, the potential opportunities of various concepts of far side countermeasures were evaluated. Head/thorax injuries caused by interaction with the struck side interior were found to dominate. Countermeasures such as side support airbags and altered <b>three-point</b> <b>belt</b> geometry (e. g. four-point belts) are relevant for Δv of at least 20 – 30 km/h. The opportunity for mitigating AIS 3 + injuries in these severity ranges was found to be 19 %– 57 %. Countermeasures such as struck-side curtains are able to provide cushioning at Δv 30 to 50 km/h, which would cover almost a third of all fatalities...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{comprehensive}} plan {{to reduce the risk of}} death and serious injury in rollover crashes the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has reinitiated a program to characterize restraint system response in rollovers. A rollover restraint tester (RRT) is utilized to produce a 180 degree roll followed by a simulated roof-to-ground impact. Recognizing the unpredictability of the real world rollover phenomenon, this test provides a repeatable and consistent dynamic environment for suitable lab evaluation. Similar NHTSA research during the mid- 1990 s demonstrated an excursion reduction of up to 75 % when an inflatable belt was compared to the standard <b>three-point</b> <b>belt</b> with a 50 th percentile male [Rains, 1998]. Technologies being considered include integrated seat systems, pyrotechnic and electric resetable pretensioners, four-point belt systems, and inflatable belts. High speed video data are collected and analyzed to examine occupant head excursion throughout the tests and are presented for discussion. Though repeatable, concern about the real world relevancy of the RRT dynamics have been focused toward the absence of a mechanical component for lateral motion. This component is not inbuilt to the test fixture. This research attempts to determine if reasonably reduced excursion is possible in the simulated rollover. This research has been constrained to examining restraint systems focused to the seat. Future research to include a partial vehicle cab structure is planned to allow evaluation of devices that utilize it for a reaction surface; such as rollover air bags. Restraint advancements have primarily been focused on frontal and side crash performance. It is believed that many of these advancements can also aid in reducing occupant excursion during a rollover crash. Improving restraint effectiveness in rollovers may further enhance protection for belted, non-ejected occupants in rollovers...|$|E
50|$|Starting in 1971 {{and ending}} in 1972, the United States {{conducted}} {{a research project}} on seat belt effectiveness on a total of 40,000 vehicle occupants using car accident reports collected during that time.

40|$|Far {{side impact}} trauma has been {{demonstrated}} as {{a significant portion of}} the total trauma in side impacts. The objective of the study was to assess the potential usefulness of countermeasures and assess the trade-offs associated with generic countermeasure design. Because the WorldSID dummy has demonstrated promise as a potential far side impact dummy, it was chosen to assess countermeasures in this mode. A unique far side impact buck was designed for a sled test system that included, as a standard configuration, a center console and outboard <b>three-point</b> <b>belt</b> system. This configuration assumed a left side driver with a right side impact. The buck allowed for additional options of generic restraints including shoulder or thorax plates or an inboard shoulder belt. The entire buck could be mounted on the sled in either a 90 -degree (3 -o’clock PDOF) or a 60 -degree (2 -o’clock PDOF) orientation. A total of 19 WorldSID tests were completed. The inboard shoulder belt configuration produced high shear forces in the lower neck (2430 N) when the belt position was placed over the mid portion of the neck. Shear forces were reduced and of opposite sign when the inboard belt position was horizontal and over the shoulder; forces were similar to the standard outboard belt configuration (830 – 1100 N). A shoulder or thorax restraint was effective in limiting the head excursion, but each caused significant displacement at the corresponding region on the dummy. A shoulder restraint resulted in shoulder displacements of 30 – 43 mm. A thorax restraint caused thorax deflections of 39 – 64 mm. Inboard restraints for far side impacts can be effective in reducing head excursion but the specific design and placement of these restraints determine their overall injury mitigating characteristics...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{experiments}} {{originally designed}} to quantify chest deflections of human cadavers and manikins, are used in an analytical scheme to predict force distributions over the chest and shoulder. In these experiments, cadavers and the 50 th percentile Hybrid III manikin were used in deceleration sled tests to simulate a frontal crash. Six cadaver tests and two Hybrid III tests were conducted at high velocity impact (ΔV = 13. 4 m/s), and three cadaver tests at low velocity impact (ΔV = 6. 7 m/s). Surrogates were instrumented with two chestbands to provide chest contours. A <b>three-point</b> <b>belt</b> instrumented with a force transducer above the shoulder level was used for restraining the surrogates. Onboard and offboard high-speed cameras captured the left and frontal-left views of the occupant. The two cameras were synchronized by a flashlight and/or film event marker. The captured crash views were used to reconstruct {{the motion of the}} surrogates in three dimensions. This information was used in conjunction with the contour records from the chestbands to reconstruct the shape of the shoulder belt at five levels; the upper anchorage point, shoulder, upper chestband, lower chestband, and the lower anchorage point. Shoulder belt tension records were used with the belt shape in vector analysis to determine the forces at the three belt levels which are in contact with the occupant. Student T-test was used to establish statistical significance. Kinematic results showed that the vertical range of motion of the head and thorax in the Hybrid III manikin are more than those in the cadavers at high speed (p 3 ̆c 0. 04). Also, human cadaver studies showed that the frontal range of motion of the head and thorax are more in high speed tests (p 3 ̆c 0. 02).

40|$|Objective Since the {{shoulders}} are rarely seriously injured in frontal or oblique collisions, {{they have been}} given low priority {{in the development of}} frontal impact crash test dummies. The shoulder complex geometry and its kinematics are of vital importance for the overall dummy kinematics. The shoulder complex also influences the risk of the safety belt slipping off the shoulder in oblique forward collisions. The first aim {{of this study was to}} develop a new 50 th percentile male THOR shoulder design while the second was to compare the new shoulder, mounted on a THOR NT dummy, with volunteer, THOR NT and Hybrid III range-of-motion and stiffness data. The third aim was to test the repeatability of the new shoulder during dynamic testing and to see how the design behaves with respect to belt slippage in a 45 ° far-side collision. Methods The new 50 th percentile THOR shoulder design was developed with the aid of a shell model of the seated University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) 50 th percentile male with coordinates for joints and bony landmarks (Schneider et al., 1983). The new shoulder design has human-like bony landmarks for the acromion and coracoid processes. The clavicle curvature and length are also made similar to that of a male human, as is the range-of-motion in the anterior-posterior, superior-inferior and medial-lateral directions. The new shoulder design was manufactured and tested under the same conditions that Törnvall et al. (2005 b) used to compare the shoulder range-of-motion for the volunteers, Hybrid III and THOR Alpha. The new design was also tested in two dynamic test configurations: the first was a 0 ° full-frontal test and the second was a 45 ° far-side test. The dummy tests were conducted with an R- 16 seat with a <b>three-point</b> <b>belt,</b> the ΔV was 27. 0 ± 0. 5 km/h and the maximum peak acceleration was approximately 14. 6 ± 0. 5 g for each test. Results A new shoulder design with geometry close to that of humans was developed to be retrofitted to the THOR NT dummy. The results showed that the range-of-motion for the new shoulder complex during static loading was larger by at least a factor of three, for the maximum load (200 N/arm), than that of either the Hybrid III or the THOR NT; this means it was more similar to the volunteers’ range-of-motion. It was observed that the THOR NT with the new shoulder did not slide out of the shoulder-belt during a far-side collision. The performance of the new shoulder was reasonably repeatable and stable during both the static tests and the sled tests. Conclusions A new shoulder for the THOR NT has been designed and developed, and data from static range-of-motion tests and sled tests indicate that the new shoulder complex has the potential to function in a more human-like manner on the THOR dummy...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringMass transit bus {{is one of}} the key {{modes of}} transportation, {{especially}} in highly populated areas of the United States (US). Review of literature has shown that there is very little research, which focuses on the safety and comfort of a bus operator. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has a Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS). FARS shows that there were 300 fatal bus accidents during the period from 1995 to 1999. Statistical data also shows that 16 bus operators suffered fatal injuries during the period from 1991 to 2000. The operators end up driving for long duration of time, which makes the three-point type of belt restraint system uncomfortable. This may also lead to stress and fatigue. The use of a two-point seat belt restraint system may be more comfortable for the operator since his hands and torso will be unrestrained. However, the physical sled testing of this seat belt configuration revealed severe life threatening risk for the operator. It was observed that the Head Injury Criteria (HIC 15) value was above the threshold limit of 700 and the femur load value was well over their allowable threshold limit of 10, 000 N. The Neck Injury Criteria (Nij) value was very close to the allowable threshold limit of 1. Thus, safety and comfort of the transit bus operator appear to be contradictory to each other. In this research, an effort had been made to develop a methodology to design an airbag restraint system for a mass transit bus operator, which can satisfy the two contradictory objectives. An Inflatable lap belt type of airbag restraint system has been previously implemented in aircraft safety. This system is comprised of a two-point restraint type seat belt system with an airbag embedded in it. This type of airbag safety system was tested in this study for a mass transit bus operator with an aim to keep the HIC and the Nij values within allowable limits. Additional knee-padding was designed to minimize the femur loads. All of the research was conducted for frontal impact of a bus with the rigid-wall crash condition. A model development of a two-point restraint type seat belt system was carried out with the occupant simulation code, MADYMO. This model is validated with the help of physical sled test data. The baseline simulation model was used to develop the numerical model of an inflatable lap belt airbag restraint system. With the help of numerical models, the prototypes of airbag and inflators were manufactured. A physical sled test was also carried out for this system under frontal impact condition. This test data was utilized to validate the simulation results obtained from the MADYMO model. The physical sled testing as well as numerical models were developed for the <b>three-point</b> <b>belt</b> restraint system. Except the femur injury, all of the injuries were within the allowable safe limit. A physical sled test with the airbag and the knee-padding was also conducted to test the performance of an inflatable lap belt airbag restraint system. A knee-padding played a vital role to minimize the femur injury. The Results from this study can be utilized in the design and development of a safety belt system for optimal protection of mass transit bus operators in the event of a frontal impact crashes. This study can be utilized further for designing the safety restraint system for other crash conditions...|$|E
40|$|This project {{helped to}} {{identify}} priorities {{for improving the}} safety of rear seat occupants through a literature review and NASS-CDS injury analysis. The literature review covers injury patterns of rear seat occupants, new safety technologies intended for the rear seat, studies of rear seat belt and seat geometry, and methods for assessing belt fit; key points follow. Most rear-seat cushion lengths exceed the recommended length of 440 mm intended for accommodating adults. Since children make up 70 % of rear seat occupants, built-in booster seats with shorter cushion lengths designed to accommodate children aged 5 - 8 would be beneficial. Front seats tend to have steeper outboard lap-belt angles, more forward shoulder belt anchors, and narrower spacing between lap belt anchorages than in the rear seat; target lap belt angles in the rear seat should range from 45 to 70 degrees. Booster seats are potentially more effective at mitigating poor lap belt geometry than poor shoulder belt geometry, so improving shoulder belt geometry in the rear seat should have higher priority. Load limiters, seatbelt pretensioners, and inflatable belt systems are potential countermeasures for reducing thoracic injury for rear seat occupants. If load limiters are installed in rear seats, the amount of available space for occupant displacement would be more important to consider in the rear seat than in the front seat. The NASS-CDS database was first used to identify rear-row occupant seating patterns. In the second row, adults tend {{to sit on the}} right side, but this is not true for children. Vans are the only vehicle type with substantial numbers of 3 rd row seating. The ages of rear seat occupant vary substantially with driver age. Drivers aged 16 - 25 most likely have other 16 - 25 YO or 0 - 4 YO occupants in the rear seat. For drivers aged 26 - 50, 85 % of their rear seat occupants are under aged 16. Drivers over age 50 have the greatest proportion of passengers over age 50 in the rear seat. From the injury analysis, seating in the rear seat is protective in terms of fatality and injury reduction, regardless of restraint use, except for rear impacts. The back of the front seat is a common injury contact point for rear-seat occupants. Studies of belt restraints have seldom found a difference in effectiveness between the front and rear seat. Most common injury contact points in side impact for belted children are on the lower rear quarter of the rear window. The presence of other occupants in the rear seat provides some benefit in injury reduction for children involved in side impacts, possibly by limiting lateral movement. Pediatric abdominal injury patterns indicate that the rear seats of minivans provide an environment with lower risk of abdomen injury compared to the back seats of passenger cars and SUVs. Pediatric injury rates are similar for children riding in SUVs and passenger cars, as potential benefits of a heavier vehicle are offset by a greater tendency to be in rollovers. Presence of a <b>three-point</b> <b>belt</b> rather than a lap-only belt reduces pediatric risk of AIS 2 + injury by 81 %. The presence of a shoulder belt in the center rear seating position usually only affects seating practices when there is a single child occupant in the rear seat...|$|E
