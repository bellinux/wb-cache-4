On {{the day of the}} wedding, Elaine tells Jerry that the reason that she was angry was {{because it was the first}} time she saw him flirt with another woman. They decide that they have to be able to <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> about their {{relationships}} if they wish to remain friends. Elaine then reveals that she has recently met a man using a stake out.|$|E
5|$|Otjes's {{approach}} is more empirical {{than that of}} many contributors to Political Animals and Animal Politics. He examines the Dutch Party for the Animals (PvdD), which, in 2006, won two seats in the House of Representatives. Otjes explores whether the PvdD's presence has changed {{the amount of time}} more established parties spent on animal issues by examining both parliamentary speeches and motions before and after the introduction of the PvdD members. He finds that established parties began to <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> about animal issues in 2006, and that this could be attributed to conflict between the PvdD and the established parties. Though Otjes allows that his study's relevance may seem limited, he concludes that smaller parties can affect government agenda by remaining focused on their own primary concern.|$|E
5|$|The Church holds three daily prayer {{meetings}} {{during the}} week, with two meetings on Sundays and one regular consecration. On Sunday mornings, congregants {{meet at the}} temple for Sunday School, which begins with prayers and hymns. After that, the preacherusually a ministerpresides over a talk during which he reads from the Bible and presents the material to be covered throughout the week. During the talk, {{it is common for}} members of either sex to read a cited verse from the Bible. At the end of the <b>talk,</b> <b>more</b> hymns and prayers are recited and voluntary offerings are given. Sunday evening services begin with hymns and prayers, after which members of the congregation of both sexes recite from the Bible or sing hymns. A shorter talk is held with the aim of deepening the Sunday School's talk.|$|E

25|$|Leanne {{split up}} with Peter {{and started a}} new {{relationship}} with Nick. They book their wedding for Christmas Day but Leanne visits Peter after Peter confesses he wants her back. Leanne's sister, Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley) revealed all at the wedding, causing Nick to leave Leanne. Nick confides in his sister-in-law, Kylie Platt (Paula Lane), and she reveals to him that Eva has been quietly causing trouble between him and Leanne. After a heart to heart, they give into temptation and sleep together. They agree {{that it was a}} mistake. Nick and Leanne reconcile and finally marry– just after Kylie announces she is pregnant. Nick encourages Kylie to have an abortion and she nearly goes through with it. David, who is desperate to start a family, discovers Kylie's pregnancy and stops her. David overhears Kylie talking about her one-night stand with Nick, and begins a vendetta on Nick and Leanne, which includes a poison pen letter to Leanne, stolen money, bad reviews on the internet and watering down the spirits at the Bistro. Nick and David went in the Bistro van and started arguing about the one-night stand with Kylie. David was desperate not to let Nick reveal all to Kylie and Leanne, as David feared losing Kylie if she found out what David had done to take revenge on Nick. David tried to get Nick to stop the van. In the struggle, David removes Nick's seatbelt and stops the van {{in the middle of the}} road, which results in the van being hit by a lorry, knocking them both unconscious. David wakes up shortly after with minor injuries, but Nick does not. Nick is left comatose and has a blood clot removed from his brain. While Nick is in his coma, Kylie gives birth to a baby girl, Lily. When Nick awakes from his coma, he suffers a panic attack when he sees David in front of him. Later, when Nick can <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> fluently, he blackmails David to get Lily a paternity test to see who the father is or he will tell the police and the Platt family how the accident was really caused. David does so, and with his friend Tina, he opens the results, revealing that David is the father of baby Lily. Nick later finds life frustrating when he cannot remember simple things. He is discharged from hospital with a walking stick, and goes to live with Leanne. On the day of Lily's christening everything is revealed. Leanne finds out about Nick and Kylie's one-night stand and the entire Platt clan discover that David caused the car accident. They disown David, but Nick is distraught when Leanne flees Weatherfield. She later comes back, but she splits up with Nick after he shouts at Simon and smacks her across the face at Christmas 2013. On the same day, Kylie goes on a drunken rampage and gets arrested. In January 2014, David and Kylie make up.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, when Aronofsky turned 30 years old, {{his parents}} were {{diagnosed}} with cancer. He began reflecting on human mortality, [...] "That was a really heavy-duty emotional time. I know it's a very young age, but turning thirty marks when your twenties are over and you could start considering, 'Wow, {{one of these days}} I'm actually going to die.'" [...] While his parents overcame cancer, he began to focus on the concept of a young man saving a loved one from a life-threatening disease. He shared the concept with Handel, his undergraduate school roommate at Harvard University. Handel earned a Ph.D in neuroscience from New York University but was uncertain about a future in neuroscience. He recalled the discussion, [...] "Darren and I just started talking about the story. We kept wanting to <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> about it as the story kept getting bigger. I decided to make some life choices to continue working with Darren, because it was so much fun." ...|$|E

500|$|Compared with Vitalogy and No Code, Yield {{represented}} {{more of a}} {{team effort}} between {{all members of the}} group. Lead vocalist Eddie Vedder had made the final decisions for the albums Vitalogy and No Code; however, {{at the end of the}} No Code recording sessions, Vedder suggested to bassist Jeff Ament that it would be better for the other members to write and bring in more complete songs so Vedder would be under less pressure to finish the songs. Ament said that [...] "everybody took that to heart," [...] and O'Brien added that most of the songs came to the studio finished. Ament also said that Vedder's reaction to the rest of the band's new material kept [...] "everybody energized about their place in the band." [...] Vedder worked with the other band members on their own material before work was started on his. Guitarist Mike McCready noticed a change in Vedder's attitude during the recording of Yield, stating, [...] "I used to be afraid of him and not want to confront him on things ... We <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> now, and hang out ... He seems very, very centered now." ...|$|E

2500|$|Auditions {{were held}} in many {{locations}} around Australia.

A second part of the process was a screen test where they had to <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> about what they would do if they had their own show and deliver a tagline or marketing slogan that summarises their personality and character.|$|E

2500|$|In 1969, Go-Set was {{the only}} Australian {{newspaper}} or magazine dealing with teen issues and culture. Rival newspapers attacked Saddington's direct approach, and parents, on talk-back radio, challenged her answers as not being aimed at the correct age group: [...] "her readers {{were too young to}} understand the column". Saddington defended her writing with [...] "Obviously some people can't face reality".

He said that his team came to town to bring the message of salvation. He recounts the story of Jesus' death and resurrection. He quotes from the Septuagint to assert that Jesus was the promised Christos who brought them forgiveness for their sins. Both the Jews and the [...] "God-fearing" [...] Gentiles invited them to <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> next Sabbath. At that time almost the whole city gathered. This upset some influential Jews who spoke against them. Paul used the occasion to announce a change in his mission which from then on would be to the Gentiles.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few weeks}} before the game's launch, No Man's Sky was claimed to be using the superformula based on work done by Dr. Johan Gielis in 2003, and {{subsequently}} patented by Gielis under the Dutch company Genicap which Gielis founded and serves as Chief Research Officer. Murray had mentioned the superformula while describing the procedural generation aspects of the game in an interview with The New Yorker during development. Genicap anticipates developing a software tool using the superformula for their own product that they can see being used in video game development, which Hello Games would be infringing on if they had used the superformula in the game. The company states they have attempted to reach out to Hello Games to ask them about its use for No Man's Sky but have not received anything back. Genicap said {{they did not want to}} stop the launch of No Man's Sky, considered the game to be [...] "very impressive", and that they would like to <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> with Hello Games to exchange knowledge with them, but [...] "if the formula is used we'll need to have a talk". Murray replied that No Man's Sky does not use the superformula, and was working to arrange a meeting with Genicap to discuss the situation and their respective mathematics.|$|E

2500|$|Hughes and Cumia {{launched}} their new weekday afternoon show, Opie and Anthony, at WAAF in March 1995. To their surprise, Valeri left the station soon after their arrival, and the duo came to disagreements over their show {{with the new}} program director, Dave Douglas. Cumia recalled the desire to ignore the rules and advice from management and began to play less music and <b>talk</b> <b>more,</b> which changed the dynamic of the show [...] "within months". One of their most notable stunts during their time at WAAF was 100 Grand, a staged giveaway of $100,000 which was hyped on the air for several weeks. When {{it was time for}} the duo to give away the prize, the [...] "winning" [...] caller instead received a 100 Grand chocolate bar instead of the money. It was at WAAF where the show started its long running Whip 'em Out Wednesday segment that involves women flashing their breasts to drivers with a [...] "WOW" [...] sticker on their car. In June 1997, nine weeks into the promotion, the show was suspended for two weeks after Hughes and Cumia read out a confidential memo written by the station's management about the campaign on the air. Mittman put an end to the promotion after police contacted him over public safety surrounding it, but claimed the suspension was unrelated and over an [...] "internal matter". In addition to their radio show, Hughes and Cumia hosted the television show Real Rock TV and released Demented World, a compilation album of their radio bits which was released in October 1997 and sold 40,000 copies.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 November 2012, Thu Minh {{participated in}} Korean global concert M-Live MO.A (Most Amazing) in Vietnam to {{celebrate}} 20 years {{of relations between}} Korea and Vietnam. She shared her thoughts on it saying, [...] "Korea is {{the place of the}} ′Miracle of Hangang′, which affected its industries, economy and technology, so its determination to develop its cultural industry also is very high compared to other countries. Only such cultural exchanges like MO.A for the 20th anniversary of ties between the countries will help them become true 20-year friends". In this concert, she performed her new single [...] "Love you only/ Yêu mình anh" [...] and her big hits from her album, Body Language, in the Mega-mix version by Robin Skouteris both {{for the first time on}} stage. The first song got impressive and enormous compliments on her extremely powerful high notes from the local and international audiences. Controversially, the Mega-mix part had sound technical problems that made her voice from micro a bit smaller and weaker than that of the first performance that was realised by live audiences and the press at the back or up stage. Thu Minh was upset because it was not as good as her expectation without blaming on anyone and refusing to <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> on this, yet as a singer of a firm stuff, she managed well on stage, performed at her best with enthusiasm and 'burned' the whole stage for it. The Vietnamese audience was excessively shouting out her name and singing along during her performances. Her performances still brought a true pride for Vietnam after Van Mai Huong's not outstanding performance as one of the two Vietnamese representatives in MO.A.|$|E
2500|$|Klaus Iohannis {{launched}} his campaign {{in front of}} the Government, in the presence of up to 30,000 people. The special guest of the event was the Secretary General of the EPP, Antonio López-Istúriz White, who stated that [...] "Victor Ponta cannot and should not become president of the European Romania". [...] The vast majority of Romanians are Christian Orthodox like Ponta, while Iohannis is Protestant. Commenting on a poll, according to which 58.22% of the respondents said for them the religion of the President mattered, while 39.81% said they were indifferent to the issue, Ponta said he did not believe that a candidate for President [...] "has a problem if he is Orthodox or is not of Romanian ethnicity". Iohannis has reacted strongly to the statement by his rival, saying that bringing the issue of religion is a [...] "painful attempt" [...] to poison the campaign. Iohannis' slogan in the presidential campaign was [...] "less <b>talk,</b> <b>more</b> things done", alluding to frequent television appearances of his rival, Victor Ponta. In his presidential program are mentioned, among others: deepening of the strategic partnership with the United States, allocation of 2% of GDP for defense, 6% for health and 6% for education, restructuring of the management system of EU funds, development of the capital market, keeping the flat tax, return of VAT to 19%, etc. Iohannis proposes a liberal economy based on competitiveness and prosperity, encouragement of a highly developed agriculture, connection of Romania to the Western world through infrastructure or decentralization, as [...] "vector of modernization". Likewise, for Klaus Iohannis, the European path of the Republic of Moldova is a national priority.|$|E
