5|$|Katy and Shell {{explore and}} enter Hector's bedroom, where {{they find a}} circle of salt around the bed. They hear the bell again and trace the sound to Andras's room. When Katy opens the bed's curtains, Andras's {{deformed}} body is revealed; he {{is tied to the}} bed and gagged. Katy goes to untie him, believing that Hector and Tabitha have kept him prisoner. Shell asks how Andras could have rung the bell if his hands were tied. Hector and Tabitha appear and show that it is they who rang the bell. They quote Dante's Inferno and explain that Hell is cold, as the text says, so the house must be kept refrigerated for Andras. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> was possessed at age ten by Castiel, demon of mischief, but Castiel needs a new human host every fifty years, and Andras is now dying. Katy was chosen as the next host after a mutual friend at Tabitha and Hector's church recommended her to them. It is revealed that Shell also attends the church, and she helped them to lure Katy. Shell implies that the church's members protect the earth from being overrun by demons.|$|E
25|$|In 2011 {{the lawyers}} of Bin al-Shibh {{argued that he}} may be unfit to stand trial and {{participate}} in his own defense. They have asked that the proceedings against him and his four co-accused be stayed until his mental state is determined. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> has been prescribed psychotropic drugs of the sort that are used to treat schizophrenia. Bin al-Shibh claims that he is mentally fit, has denounced his lawyers, and says that he wants to represent himself before the commissions.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{small amount}} of middle ground between those who term the events a coup and those who call them a constitutionally-sound {{succession}} of power. On the one hand, several supporters of Zelaya's removal, including Acting Honduran President Roberto Micheletti and the top army lawyer, have admitted that sending Zelaya out of the country was illegal, although they argue it was justified by the need to prevent violence. Micheletti said forcing deposed President Manuel Zelaya to leave the country, instead of arresting him, was a mistake. On the other hand, a fraction of those who oppose the events consider the arrest warrant against Zelaya to be legal, although <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> was denied a fair trial.|$|E

500|$|His linemates {{included}} future Hall of Famers Alf Smith, Harry Westwick, Billy Gilmour and Tommy Smith. Frank Patrick, {{a contemporary}} of McGee's and like him {{a member of}} the Hockey Hall of Fame, described McGee: [...] "He was even better than <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> was. He had everything - speed, stickhandling, scoring ability and was a punishing checker. He was strongly built but beautifully proportioned and he had an almost animal rhythm." ...|$|E
500|$|A bootleg {{recording}} {{from the}} Ricky-Tick club in London before Cream recorded {{the song in}} the studio, shows [...] "Sunshine of Your Love" [...] with a beat common to rock for the period. [...] Cream drummer Ginger Baker compared it to the uptempo [...] "Hey Now, Princess", another Bruce/Brown composition Cream recorded in March. [...] He has claimed that he advised Bruce to slow it down {{and came up with}} the distinctive drum pattern which emphasises beats one and three (typical rock drumming favours beats two and four and is known as the backbeat). [...] However, Bruce and recording engineer Tom Dowd dispute Baker's claim, which <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> only made much later. [...] Dowd later explained ...|$|E
500|$|While MalcolmX and {{scholars}} contemporary to the book's publication regarded Haley as the book's ghostwriter, modern scholars tend to regard {{him as an}} essential collaborator. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> intentionally muted his authorial voice to create the effect of MalcolmX speaking directly to readers. Haley influenced some of MalcolmX's literary choices. For example, MalcolmX left the Nation of Islam during the period {{when he was working}} on the book with Haley. Rather than rewriting earlier chapters as a polemic against the Nation which Malcolm X had rejected, Haley persuaded him to favor a style of [...] "suspense and drama". According to Manning Marable, [...] "Haley was particularly worried about what he viewed as MalcolmX's anti-Semitism" [...] and he rewrote material to eliminate it.|$|E

500|$|Mercury {{was noted}} for his live performances, which were often {{delivered}} to stadium audiences around the world. He displayed a highly theatrical style that often evoked {{a great deal}} of participation from the crowd. A writer for The Spectator described him as [...] "a performer out to tease, shock and ultimately charm his audience with various extravagant versions of himself." [...] David Bowie, who performed at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert and recorded the song [...] "Under Pressure" [...] with Queen, praised Mercury's performance style, saying: [...] "Of all the more theatrical rock performers, Freddie took it further than the rest... he took it over the edge. And of course, I always admired a man who wears tights. I only saw him in concert once and as <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> <b>he</b> was definitely a man who could hold an audience {{in the palm of his}} hand." [...] Queen guitarist Brian May wrote that Mercury could make [...] "the last person at the back of the furthest stand in a stadium feel that he was connected". Mercury's main prop on stage was a broken microphone stand, which after accidentally snapping off the heavy base during an early performance, he realised could be used in endless ways.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song relate to a 1940s Los Angeles-based group called [...] "Nature Boys", a {{subculture}} of proto-hippies of which ahbez was a member. Instrumentalist Chris Tyle noted that the lyrics are a musical self-portrait of ahbez, with the lines like [...] "There was a boy, A very strange, enchanted boy, <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> wandered very far, Very far, over land and sea". But he {{believed that it was}} the song's last line that made it the most poignant: [...] "The greatest thing you'll ever learn, Is just to love and be loved in return". Various interpretations of the line are given by academics, with the eponymous nature boy being a child, advising on love and relationship, or an adult hippie talking about his journey and inner-love. According to author Jeffrey P. Dennis, the song presented a homo-romantic theme, with the eponymous nature boy visiting Cole on a [...] "magic day" [...] and explaining that [...] "the greatest thing you'll ever learn, is just to love and be loved in return". Author Raymond Knapp described the track as a [...] "mystically charged vagabond song" [...] whose lyrics evoked an intense sense of loss and haplessness, with the final line delivering a universal truth, described by Knapp as [...] "indestructible" [...] and [...] "salvaged somehow from the perilous journey of life".|$|E

2500|$|After the {{seriousness}} of his previous films, Kramer [...] "felt compelled to answer" [...] for the [...] "lack of lightness" [...] in his earlier films, writes Spoto. As a result, he directed It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963), a film with a [...] "gifted, wacky crew of comedians." [...] Kramer describes it as a [...] "comedy about greed." [...] According to one writer, he directed it [...] "to prove he could also handle comedy" [...] and hired many of the leading comedic actors of the previous decades, from silent star Buster Keaton to emerging talent Jonathan Winters. Winters would later write that [...] "Kramer {{was a man who}} took chances—as <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> <b>he</b> worked without a net." ...|$|E

Ludwig is eager to meet me, because he liked my portrait. My brother has invited them all to come to Madrid. The two brothers will arrive in the fall.

2500|$|In July 2008, the {{prosecutor}} of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Luis Moreno Ocampo, accused al-Bashir of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes in Darfur. The court issued {{an arrest warrant}} for al-Bashir on [...] 2009 on counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, but ruled that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him for genocide. However, on 12 July 2010, the Court issued a second warrant containing three separate counts. The new warrant, as with the first, were delivered to the Sudanese government, which did not recognize it nor the ICC. [...] The indictments do not allege that Bashir personally took part in such activities. Instead, <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> <b>he</b> is [...] "suspected of being criminally responsible, as an indirect co-perpetrator". Some international experts think {{it is unlikely that}} Ocampo has enough evidence. The court's decision is opposed by the African Union, League of Arab States, Non-Aligned Movement, and the governments of Russia and China.|$|E

2500|$|Early episodes {{featured}} Dave Lee, {{who provided}} piano accompaniment on I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again. However, Colin Sell now usually fills this role. He {{is often the}} butt of jokes about his musical ability to which {{he is unable to}} respond as he has no microphone. [...] For example: [...] "When music experts hear Colin's compositions, <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> could have been another Berlin, Porter or anybody else employed by the German State Railway." [...] Guest pianists are called in when Sell has been unable to attend (or the ISIHAC team have [...] "won the coin toss" [...] as Lyttelton once said on the show), including Neil Innes, Denis King and Matthew Scott. Lyttelton's band also appeared on a couple of Christmas specials. Once when Innes was guesting Lyttelton outlined the musician's career, concluding that this [...] "has brought him to where he is today: standing in for Colin Sell." [...] In another appearance Innes sang along to his own composition [...] "I'm the Urban Spaceman" [...] during a round of [...] "Pick Up Song".|$|E
2500|$|Mark {{contains}} twenty {{accounts of}} miracles and healings, accounting {{for almost a}} third of the gospel and half the first ten chapters, more, proportionally, than in any other gospel. In the gospels as a whole, Jesus' miracles, prophecies, etc., are presented as evidence of God's rule, but Mark's descriptions of Jesus' healings are a partial exception to this, as his methods, using spittle to heal blindness (Mark 8:22–26) and magic formulae ("Talitha cumi," [...] 5:41, [...] "Ephphatha," [...] 7:34), were those of a magician. This is the charge the Jewish religious leaders bring against Jesus: <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> is performing exorcisms with the aid of an evil spirit (Mark 3:22) and calling up the spirit of John the Baptist (Mark 6:14). [...] "There was... no period {{in the history of the}} [...] empire in which the magician was not considered an enemy of society," [...] subject to penalties ranging from exile to death, says Classical scholar Ramsay MacMullen. All the gospels defend Jesus against the charge, which, if true, would contradict their ultimate claims for him. The point of the Beelzebub incident in Mark (Mark 3:20–30) is to set forth Jesus' claims to be an instrument of God, not Satan.|$|E
