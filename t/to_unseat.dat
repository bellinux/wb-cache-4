5|$|Because of Barkley's role in {{crafting}} the Railway Labor Act, the Associated Railway Labor Organizations endorsed him <b>to</b> <b>unseat</b> Ernst {{even before}} he formally announced his candidacy on April 26, 1926. Since the 1923 gubernatorial contest, he had distanced himself from Haly and promised the conservatives {{that he would not}} push a ban on parimutuel betting if elected. Consequently, he had no opposition in the primary. Congressman (and later Chief Justice) Fred M. Vinson managed his general election campaign.|$|E
5|$|Despite Beckham's move <b>to</b> <b>unseat</b> McCreary in the Senate, the {{two were}} once again allies by 1911, when Beckham {{supported}} the aging McCreary for the party's gubernatorial nomination. It is unclear whether McCreary sought the reconciliation {{in order to secure}} the gubernatorial nomination or Beckham made amends with McCreary because he thought he could control McCreary's actions as governor. In the Democratic primary, McCreary defeated William Adams by a majority of 25,000 votes.|$|E

5|$|In 1974 Weizsäcker was the Presidential {{candidate}} {{of his party}} for the first time, but he lost to Walter Scheel of the FDP, who {{was supported by the}} ruling center-left coalition. Ahead of the 1976 elections, CDU chairman Helmut Kohl included him in his shadow cabinet for the party’s campaign <b>to</b> <b>unseat</b> incumbent Helmut Schmidt as chancellor.

The Devil's Due incarnation of the Red Shadows organization bears little resemblance to the Red Shadows organization that fought the UK Action Force. The Red Shadows are portrayed as an independent paramilitary organization that has no ties to Cobra, and is devoted <b>to</b> <b>unseating</b> the world order with advanced science and technology.|$|R
5|$|Barkley's party loyalty in the governor's race {{made him}} a {{formidable}} candidate to challenge Stanley, who by 1924 had angered members of both party factions, but Barkley {{had spent most of}} his funds in his campaign against Cantrill, and {{he did not want to}} risk his reputation as a party unifier by challenging a Democrat. Instead, he decided to rebuild his war chest <b>to</b> <b>unseat</b> Kentucky's incumbent Republican senator, Richard P. Ernst, in 1926. In the meantime, he refrained from using his influence in state races to avoid losing any goodwill with Kentucky voters.|$|E

5|$|Realising the Conservative {{governance}} of Lambeth Borough council was hard <b>to</b> <b>unseat,</b> Livingstone aided Eddie Lopez in {{reaching out to}} members of the local populace disenfranchised from the traditional Labour leadership.

His involvement in the SAU led to his dismissal from the PFTCC student's union, who disagreed with politicising secondary school pupils.|$|E
5|$|Sports such as polo do {{not judge}} the horse itself, but rather use the horse {{as a partner}} for human {{competitors}} as {{a necessary part of}} the game. Although the horse requires specialized training to participate, the details of its performance are not judged, only the result of the rider's actions—be it getting a ball through a goal or some other task. Examples of these sports of partnership between human and horse include jousting, in which the main goal is for one rider <b>to</b> <b>unseat</b> the other, and buzkashi, a team game played throughout Central Asia, the aim being to capture a goat carcass while on horseback.|$|E
50|$|McCallion {{was easily}} elected {{throughout}} {{her career as}} mayor, with no serious challengers coming close <b>to</b> <b>unseating</b> her. She never campaigned during elections and refused to accept political donations, instead asking her supporters to donate the money to charity. Her final term as mayor, won in the election of October 2010, was her twelfth consecutive term. She announced during her final term {{that she would not}} be running for re-election in the 2014 municipal elections and endorsed councilor and former federal MP Bonnie Crombie to replace her as Mayor.

40|$|Skewed bridges {{collapsed}} due <b>to</b> <b>unseating</b> of {{the decks}} from their support resulted from {{rotation of the}} decks around the vertical axis in past earthquakes. Skewed bridges show very unique structural response {{as a result of}} poundings of the decks to the substructures and the effect of restrainers. This paper clarifies the mechanism of rotations of skewed bridges and shows the effectiveness of cable restrainers on the mitigation of the rotations. Three configurations of cable restrainers are clarified here: 1) cable restrainers in the weak axis, 2) cable restrainers in the longitudinal direction, and 3) cable restrainers crossing the ends of adjacent decks. It is found that the cross cable restrainers are effective on the mitigation of the rotation of skewed bridges...|$|R
5|$|While {{there were}} many {{violations}} of the ceasefire, the incidents were relatively minor. The two governments immediately started complex diplomatic manoeuvres to bring world opinion on their side in case, as was widely expected, the conflict was resumed. However, the two sides were also careful to leave {{the door open for}} a peaceful solution. The latter course was promoted by France and most African states, while the Reagan Administration saw a resumption of the conflict as the best chance <b>to</b> <b>unseat</b> Gaddafi.|$|E
5|$|During the 2008 United States presidential election, {{like most}} of the New York State Democratic establishment, Brown was a {{supporter}} of Hillary Clinton, the United States Senator from New York.

He even ran to be a delegate for Clinton at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. In July 2008, Golisano announced that he would attempt to create change in Albany by spending $5million on targeted campaigns.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} noise-based methods, {{the purpose}} {{of which is to}} determine whether the core of a Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) contains unseated fuel assembly(ies) or not. The characteristic feature of an unseated fuel assembly is to render the corresponding fuel channel thermal-hydraulically unstable since some of the coolant bypasses the fuel channel. The induced neutron noise has a strong space-dependence due to the localized character of the perturbation. Several techniques relying on the analysis of the spatial structure of the in-core neutron noise can thus be used to determine whether the induced neutron noise might correspond <b>to</b> <b>unseated</b> fuel assembly(ies). These techniques rely on time-domain and frequency-domain analysis. This paper presents in all cases expected spatial signatures determined from calculations, and compares these theoretical findings to two practical examples, where noise measurements were carried out: a local instability event, and a global oscillation coexisting with a regional oscillation...|$|R

5|$|In early 1947, Quwatli and the National Party, {{the largest}} party in parliament, made an {{amendment}} to the constitution to enable Quwatli to seek re-election. The move was met by strong disapproval from rival Syrian parties and opposition politicians, and a campaign <b>to</b> <b>unseat</b> Quwatli in the next presidential election was commenced. Quwatli's allies won 24 out of 127 seats during the 1947 parliamentary election, the first in post-independence Syria, while the opposition won 53 seats and independents unaffiliated with any political party won 50. A number of Quwatli's allies defected from the National Party and former president Atassi retired from politics because of his frustration at Quwatli's handling of Syrian internal affairs. Quwatli tasked Jamil Mardam Bey to form a new cabinet in October, which included mostly pro-Western politicians.|$|E
5|$|In the 2001 {{parliamentary}} election the party lost the gains {{it had made}} according to opinion polling but maintained its position from the 1997 election, it got 14.6% and 26 members in the parliament. The election result allowed them <b>to</b> <b>unseat</b> the Labour Party government of Jens Stoltenberg {{and replace it with}} a three-party coalition led by Christian Democrat Kjell Magne Bondevik. However, the coalition continued to decline to govern together with the Progress Party as they considered the political differences too large. The Progress Party eventually decided to tolerate the coalition, as it promised to invest more in defence, open more private hospitals and open for more competition in the public sector. In 2002 the Progress Party again advanced in the opinion polls and for a while became the largest party.|$|E
5|$|In the West, {{however, the}} loose {{ends of the}} Diocletianic {{settlement}} were about to bring the whole Tetrarchic tapestry down. Constantine, son of Constantius, and Maxentius, son of Maximian, had been overlooked in the Diocletianic succession, offending the parents and angering the sons. Constantine, against Galerius's will, succeeded his father on July 25, 306. He immediately ended any ongoing persecutions and offered Christians full restitution {{of what they had}} lost under the persecution. This declaration gave Constantine the opportunity to portray himself as a possible liberator of oppressed Christians everywhere. Maxentius, meanwhile, had seized power in Rome on October 28, 306, and soon brought toleration to all Christians within his realm. Galerius made two attempts <b>to</b> <b>unseat</b> Maxentius, but failed both times. During the first campaign against Maxentius, Severus was captured, imprisoned, and executed.|$|E
