25|$|I {{just want}} to say <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> 16 or 17 years old, I went to see Buddy Holly play at Duluth National Guard Armory and I was three feet away from him… and he looked at me. And I just have some kind of feeling that he was – I don’t know how or why – but I know he was with us all the time we were making this record in some kind of way.|$|E
25|$|It was Hofmann. It was, I think, {{his last}} {{performance}} in Toronto, {{and it was}} a staggering impression. The only thing I can really remember is <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> being brought home in a car, I was in that wonderful state of half-awakeness in which you hear all sorts of incredible sounds going through your mind. They were all orchestral sounds, but I was playing them all, and suddenly I was Hofmann. I was enchanted.|$|E

Kurt Russell did an incredible job, and {{it would be fun to}} see someone else try." [...] Russell has commented on the remake and on the casting of Butler as Plissken, saying, [...] "I will say <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> told who was going to play Snake Plissken, my initial reaction was 'Oh, man!' [...] I do think that character was quintessentially one thing. And that is, American." ...|$|E
3000|$|Theorem  5 implies Theorem  2, as <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>is</b> finite every SCF is CNT. Cato (2011) shows <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>is</b> arbitrary, STP {{is implied}} {{by any of}} the {{following}} axioms: Maskin monotonicity, independent weak monotonicity, independent person-by-person monotonicity and coalitional strategy proofness. Thus, one can replace STP in Theorem  5 {{by any of the}}m; in particular, the Muller-Satterthwaite theorem holds for the countable society under CNT. It also reveals <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>is</b> countable, under UNM and CNT all of these axioms are equivalent as each implies DT. 7 [...]...|$|R

500|$|Sonia was {{diagnosed}} with type 1 diabetes at age seven, and began taking daily insulin injections. Her father died of heart problems at age 42, when she was nine years old. After this, she became fluent in English. Sotomayor has {{said that she was}} first inspired by the strong-willed Nancy Drew book character, and then after her diabetes diagnosis led doctors to suggest a different career from detective, she was inspired to go into a legal career and become a judge by watching the Perry Mason television series. [...] She reflected in 1998: [...] "I was going to college and I was going to become an attorney, and I knew <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ten. Ten. That's no jest." ...|$|E
500|$|Bill Janovitz of Allmusic {{describes}} the music as beautiful, with folk guitar chord changes and a somber melody, while the chorus, with its line [...] "and it's all over now, Baby Blue" [...] has a heartbreaking quality to it. Like other Dylan {{songs of the}} period, such as [...] "Chimes of Freedom" [...] and [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man", the lyrics of [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] bear the strong influence of Symbolist poets such as Arthur Rimbaud. Lines such as [...] "take what you have gathered from coincidence" [...] reflect the I Ching philosophy that coincidence represents more than mere chance. The song was described by Q magazine as, [...] "The most toxic of strummed kiss-offs, with not a snowball's chance in hell of reconciliation." [...] Dylan, later describing the song, said that [...] "I had carried that song around in my head {{for a long time}} and I remember <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> writing it, I'd remembered a Gene Vincent song. It had always been one of my favorites, Baby Blue... 'When first I met my baby/she said how do you do/she looked into my eyes and said/my name is Baby Blue.' [...] It was one of the songs I used to sing back in high school. Of course, I was singing about a different Baby Blue." ...|$|E
500|$|By 2003, she {{was being}} {{recognised}} around the world from countries like Portugal and Japan. She said of her private life: [...] "I don't really have a private life. I've found it difficult as an athlete, to maintain a relationship. It's not {{one of my best}} points but I've got family and friends who compensate for <b>that.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> younger I went out and had a lot of fun, and there were moments when people criticised me for that, and you know what, I'm young, I'm going to do that, and anyone who is going to get on me for that ... I really didn't care." [...] She does not like to go clubbing for two reasons: First, she gets recognised by too many people. [...] Second, everyone wants to comment on her height. In response to getting a hug from Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics during the closing ceremonies, internet rumours started that Jackson and the married Ming were romantically involved. [...] These rumours were incorrect. [...] Jackson said of them: [...] "When we came across this Yao Ming thing it was like, 'Oh...My...God! When I tell you we were in hysterics...because anybody who knows me knows that would be the last thing on my mind. A 7 foot 8 Chinese man? That's just not my thing. I really respect him as a player. And people who know me know I can be wild and over-the-top. I'm affectionate and that night I guess I was affectionate with the wrong person. I guess the Chinese people don't do that stuff very often, so the cultural [...] was a big thing. But I don't care. You have to laugh about things or you'll be crying, which I would probably have been doing anyway [...] I made the most of my last night at the Olympics and had a great time." [...] She partied a fair amount in her early 20s. By 2010, she was not able to stay out at night clubs until 5:30am any more because she lacked the stamina.|$|E

2500|$|When an {{interviewer}} said that saving Cedric's body resembled {{the actions of}} Hector, Achilles, and Patroclus in the Iliad, Rowling said, [...] "That's where it came from. That really, really, really moved me when I read <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> 19. The idea of the desecration of a body, a very ancient idea... I was thinking of that when Harry saved Cedric's body." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{certainly}} {{had an enormous}} influence on me [...] I remember <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> Generalmusikdirektor in Aachen, a friend invited me to a concert that Furtwängler gave in Cologne [...] Furtwängler's performance of the Schumann's Fourth, which I didn't know at the time, opened up a new world for me. I was deeply impressed. I didn't want to forget this concert, so I immediately returned to Aachen.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{fans have}} speculated that this song was a tribute to Grohl's {{deceased}} friend and bandmate, Kurt Cobain. However, in Grohl's own words, the song is, [...] "(his) way of saying <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> young, I didn't have big rock heroes, I didn't want {{to grow up and}} be some big sporting hero. My heroes were ordinary people and the people that I {{have a lot of respect}} for are just solid everyday people - people you can rely on." [...] This was the third single to be released from the album.|$|E

2500|$|Meg Cabot quotes the series' {{inspiration}} on her website stating: [...] "I {{was inspired}} to write The Princess Diaries when my mom, {{after the death of}} my father, began dating one of my teachers; they later went on to get married just as Mia’s mom does in the book! I have always had a 'thing' for princesses (my parents used to joke <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> smaller, I did a lot of insisting that my 'real' parents, the king and queen, were going to come get me soon, and that everyone had better start being a LOT nicer to me) so I stuck a princess in the book just for kicks... and VOILÀ! The Princess Diaries was born." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaking {{about the}} {{thinking}} behind his {{change of name}} when he converted to Islam he stated that he was [...] "latching on to something {{that was part of}} my heritage, because many of the slaves who were brought here were Muslims. My family was brought to America by a French planter named Alcindor, who came here from Trinidad in the 18th century. My people were Yoruba, and their culture survived slavery... My father found out about <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a kid, and it gave me all I needed to know that, hey, I was somebody, even if nobody else knew about it. When I was a kid, no one would believe anything positive that you could say about black people. And that's a terrible burden on black people, because they don't have an accurate idea of their history, which has been either suppressed or distorted." ...|$|E
