5|$|The wine gallon was {{abolished}} in Britain in 1826, {{and this}} system {{was replaced by}} a new one based on the newly introduced imperial gallon. Since the imperial gallon is 20% more than the liquid gallon, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> the imperial pint in relation to the liquid pint. This explains why the number of fluid ounces per gallon had to be adjusted in the new system so that the fluid ounce was not changed too much by the reform. Even so, the modern UK fluid ounce is 4% less than the US fluid ounce, and <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> the smaller units. For some years both systems were used concurrently in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Aloe vera gel is used commercially as an {{ingredient}} in yogurts, beverages, and some desserts, although at certain doses, its toxic properties could be severe whether ingested or topically applied. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> aloe latex, which was taken orally for conditions ranging from glaucoma to multiple sclerosis until the FDA required manufacturers to discontinue its use.|$|E

5|$|As a {{consequence}} of bounded expansion, the subgraph isomorphism problem, of finding whether a pattern graph of bounded size exists as a subgraph of a larger graph, can be solved in linear time when the larger graph has bounded book thickness. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> detecting whether the pattern graph is an induced subgraph of the larger graph, or whether it has a graph homomorphism to the larger graph. For the same reason, the problem of testing whether a graph of bounded book thickness obeys a given formula of first order logic is fixed-parameter tractable.|$|E
5|$|According to the 2001 UK census, the {{industry}} of employment of Salford's residents aged 16–74 was 18.0% retail and wholesale, 14.4% property and business services, 12.3% manufacturing, 11.7% {{health and social}} work, 8.6% education, 7.3% transport and communications, 6.8% hotels and restaurants, 5.8% construction, 4.4% finance, 4.2% public administration, 0.6% energy and water supply, 0.3% agriculture, 0.1% mining, and 5.7% other. Compared with national figures, Salford had a relatively low percentage of residents working in agriculture. The census recorded the economic activity of residents aged 16–74, 4.4% students were with jobs, 9.1% students without jobs, 6.3% looking after home or family, 11.2% permanently sick or disabled, and 4.8% economically inactive for other reasons. The proportion of students economically active in Salford was higher than the City of Salford and England averages (3.0% and 2.6% respectively); <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> economically inactive students (5.1% in City of Salford and 4.7% in England). The rest of the figures were roughly inline with national trends.|$|E
5|$|In special relativity, {{energy is}} closely {{connected}} to momentum. Just as {{space and time}} are, in that theory, different aspects of a more comprehensive entity called spacetime, energy and momentum are merely different aspects of a unified, four-dimensional quantity that physicists call four-momentum. In consequence, if energy {{is a source of}} gravity, momentum must be a source as well. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> quantities that are directly related to energy and momentum, namely internal pressure and tension. Taken together, in general relativity it is mass, energy, momentum, pressure and tension that serve as sources of gravity: they are how matter tells spacetime how to curve. In the theory's mathematical formulation, all these quantities are but aspects of a more general physical quantity called the energy–momentum tensor.|$|E
