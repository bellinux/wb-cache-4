40|$|A new Klyuchevskoy volcano eruptive cycle {{encompasses}} terminal (March 30, 1972 to August 23, 1974) {{and lateral}} (August 23, 1974 to December, 1974) eruption stages. The <b>terminal</b> <b>eruption</b> stage resulted in lava flows and parasitic cones that formed on the south-western {{flank of the}} volcano. Eruption products are moderately alkalic high-alumina olivine-bearing andesite-basalts. The <b>terminal</b> <b>eruption</b> stage was accompanied by volcanic earthquakes and volcanic tremor. The lateral eruption was accompanied by explosive earthquakes. Volcanic tremor was the most useful prognostic sign indicating {{the onset of the}} lateral eruption. Eruptive mechanisms are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} 15 years Mt. Etna {{has proved to}} be one of most active volcanoes in the world. In fact, besides the almost {{continuous}} activity at its summit craters, there have been 27 sub <b>terminal</b> <b>eruptions</b> connected with the NE Crater, and 12 lateral eruptions, some of which were particularly large. The eruptions occurring since 1981 have been considered in this study. In This period extremely clear evidence can be seen of the existence of at last two main type of Etnean eruptions: paroxysmal (1981) and quiet ones (1983). For each of the eruptions considered the volcanological and petrochemical data have been critically reviewed and compared with those for some of the most significant eruptions of Mt. Etna...|$|R
40|$|New data on {{continuing}} {{advance of}} the Kamchatka glaciers Erman, Vlodavets, Sopochny, Schmidt, and Bogdanovich were obtained {{as a result of}} analysis of aerospace information taken at different times. Glacier Erman advances during the past 70   years (1945 – 2016). Over the period from 1949 to 2016, its area increased by 4. 7  km 2 and the length – by 3. 3  km (from 18. 2 to 21. 5  km). The highest speed of advancing had been estimated for the Schmidt glacier, in 2007 – 2013 it exceeded 100  m/year. We had identified a new isolated glacier between glaciers Erman and Schmidt, named as the Obvalny (the «Avalanche») glacier, since in 1945 this glacier was buried under volcanic-avalanche deposits resulted from the Klyuchevskaya volcano eruption. In 1975 – 2016, the Obvalny glacier advanced over a distance of about 1700  m. Also, we had found more 30 ice-rock massifs («wandering glaciers») on slopes of the Klyuchevskaya volcano. Their contours looked like drops or tongues, and some of them advanced in the frontal zone. From 2002 to 2016, the «wandering glacier» in the upper reaches of river Glubokaya (eastern sector of the volcano) advanced for 740  m (55  m/year). Advancing of glaciers here is a consequence of lateral and <b>terminal</b> <b>eruptions</b> of the Klyuchevskaya volcano in XX and XXI centuries. Erman Glacier, glacier advance, Klyuchevskaya volcano, lateral eruption, space images, volcanic and rock avalanche deposits, «wandering glaciers»...|$|R
40|$|Volcanic eruptions on the Moon {{take place}} in {{conditions}} of low gravity and negligible atmospheric pressure, very different from those on Earth. These differences lead to characteristic lunar versions of Hawaiian and strombolian explosive activity, and {{to the production of}} unusual eruption products neither predicted nor observed on Earth in the <b>terminal</b> stages of <b>eruptions.</b> These include the unusual mounds and rough (hummocky, blocky) floors of some small-shield summit pit crater floors, elongate depressions and mare flows (similar to those named “irregular mare patches”, IMPs, by Braden et al., 2014). We examine the ascent and eruption of magma in the waning stages of the eruptive process in small-shield summit pit crater floors and show that many IMP characteristics can be plausibly explained by basaltic magma behavior as the rise rate of the ascending magma slows to zero, volatiles exsolve in the dike and lava lake to form a very vesicular foam, and the dike begins to close. Stresses in the very vesicular and porous lava lake crust produce fractures through which the foam extrudes at a rate determined by its non-Newtonian rheology. Waning-stage extrusion of viscous magmatic foams to the surface produces convex mounds whose physical properties inhibit typical impact crater formation and regolith development, creating an artificially young crater retention age. This mechanism for the production and extrusion of very vesicular magmatic foams is also applicable to waning-stage dike closure associated with pit craters atop dikes, and fissure eruptions in the lunar maria, providing an explanation for many irregular mare patches. This mechanism implies that IMPs and associated mare structures (small shields, pit craters and fissure flows) formed synchronously billions of years ago, in contrast to very young ages (less than ~ 100 million years) proposed for IMPs by some workers...|$|R
