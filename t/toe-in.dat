2500|$|While the SA22/FB was a purer sports car, the FC tended {{toward the}} softer sport-tourer trends of its day, sharing some {{similarities}} with the HB series Cosmo. Handling was much improved, with {{less of the}} oversteer tendencies of the FB. The rear end design was vastly improved from the FB's live rear axle to a more modern, Independent Rear Suspension (rear axle). Steering was more precise, with {{rack and pinion steering}} replacing the old recirculating ball steering of the FB. Disc brakes also became standard, with some models (S4: Sport, GXL, GTU, Turbo II, Convertible; S5: GXL, GTUs, Turbo, Convertible) offering four-piston front brakes. The rear seats were optional in some models of the FC RX-7, but are not commonly found in the American Market. Mazda also introduced Dynamic Tracking Suspension System (DTSS) in the 2nd generation RX-7. The revised independent rear suspension incorporated special toe control hubs which were capable of introducing a limited degree of passive rear steering under cornering loads. The DTSS worked by allowing a slight amount of toe-out under normal driving conditions but induced slight <b>toe-in</b> under heavier cornering loads at around 0.5 Gs or more; toe-out in the rear allows for a more responsive rotation of the rear, but <b>toe-in</b> allowed for a more stable rear under heavier cornering. [...] Mazda also introduced Auto Adjusting Suspension (AAS) in the 2nd generation RX-7. The system changed damping characteristics according to the road and driving conditions. [...] The system compensated for camber changes and provided anti-dive and anti-squat effects.|$|E
2500|$|The 2004 model S2000 {{underwent}} several significant changes. Production {{moved to}} Suzuka. The new model introduced [...] wheels and Bridgestone RE-050 tires {{along with a}} retuned suspension to reduce oversteer. The spring rates and shock absorber damping were altered and the suspension geometry modified to improve stability by reducing <b>toe-in</b> changes under cornering loads. The subframe also received a revision in design to achieve a high rigidity. In the gearbox the brass synchronizers were replaced with carbon fiber. In addition, cosmetic changes {{were made to the}} exterior with new front and rear bumpers, revised headlight assemblies, new LED tail-lights, and oval-tipped exhausts. Although all the cosmetic, suspension and most drivetrain upgrades were included on the Japanese, Australian and European S2000s, they retained the 2.0l F20C engines and remained designated as AP1s.|$|E
50|$|The front rail {{wheels of}} road-rail {{vehicles}} are often set to <b>toe-in</b> by {{a distance of}} 6 mm over 1 metre.

50|$|This mid-1995 model change also {{includes}} a revision in the rear suspension that allowed adjustment of <b>toe-in.</b>|$|E
50|$|Three {{versions}} of the front suspension were installed in the cars (aside from the rubber-disc style used on the prototype). Cars #1001-1002 used a rubber torsion tube design, which suffered from severe <b>toe-in</b> during heavy braking. Tucker then switched to a rubber sandwich type suspension (with a rubber block sandwiched between {{the upper and lower}} A-arms) on cars #1003-1025, however this type was severely stiff. Starting on car #1026, Tucker finally settled on a suspension design with {{a modified version of the}} rubber torsion tube with the <b>toe-in</b> braking problem corrected.|$|E
5000|$|The TT-01R (Race) - Adds {{aluminum}} alloy drive shaft, adjustable rear <b>toe-in</b> and a Tamiya 25T [...] "GT tuned" [...] motor. The race kit {{does not come}} with a lexan body shell.|$|E
50|$|In 1995 on X300 models, the {{attachment}} {{of the lower}} wishbone to the hub carrier was changed to use a bolt with eccentric head, enabling the rear <b>toe-in</b> adjustment that was not possible before without bending the arms.|$|E
50|$|The {{suspension}} mounting provided more isolation by incorporating flexible rubber links. Progressive rebound bumpers were adopted, while the damper rates, {{front and rear}} <b>toe-in</b> and the relative angle between springs and dampers have all been altered. The steering was power-assisted rack and pinion.|$|E
50|$|This is {{the first}} showing of Mazda's SS (self-stabilizing) rear suspension. The two lower {{parallel}} links of the rear strut are designed to induce <b>toe-in</b> on the rear tire on the outer side of the curve (e.g. right turn - left rear tire).|$|E
50|$|The two {{cameras that}} make up each rover's Pancam are {{situated}} 1.5m above the ground surface, and are separated by 30 cm, with 1 degree of <b>toe-in.</b> This allows the image pairs to be made into scientifically useful stereoscopic images, which {{can be viewed as}} stereograms, anaglyphs, or processed into 3D computer images.|$|E

50|$|The Maserati Coupé and Spyder {{both have}} a light alloy double {{wishbone}} suspension. The rear suspension is fitted with a <b>toe-in</b> regulator bar which enhances the precision of the drive train and provides balanced cornering. The front suspension layout incorporates “anti-dive” features to prevent nose-diving when braking. The suspension system is completed by front and rear anti-roll bars.|$|E
50|$|The Road was {{the first}} Catrike model and was {{introduced}} in 2000. As a result of experience developing the Speed model, the Road was redesigned in 2003. The new version became available in 2004. The 2005 model introduced indirect steering, which proved more difficult to set the <b>toe-in</b> on and so in 2006 direct steering was reintroduced. The Road has 20 in wheels and is designed for general recreational use and touring.|$|E
50|$|The rear {{suspension}} was fully independent, with double wishbone and radius arm configuration, incorporating anti-squat characteristics. The car was fitted with Armstrong adjustable dampers and spring platform adjustment. Coil springs were used. A separate adjustable anti-roll bar {{was included in}} the suspension. Outboard drive-shafts were hollowed out to reduce unsprung weight. Rear hub carriers were made of magnesium cast. The suspension operates entirely on adjustable rod-ends with provision for <b>toe-in</b> and camber adjustments.|$|E
5000|$|Hobby grade {{models can}} be fine tuned, unlike most toy grade models. For example, cars often allow <b>toe-in,</b> camber and caster angle adjustments, just like their real-life counterparts. All modern [...] "computer" [...] radios allow each {{function}} {{to be adjusted}} over several parameters for ease in setup and adjustment of the model. Many of these transmitters are capable of [...] "mixing" [...] several functions at once, which is required for some models.|$|E
50|$|The new 9-3, {{like all}} other Saabs, {{remained}} a front-wheel drive car. The most drastic change from the former generation was {{the elimination of the}} hatchback design. The second-generation 9-3 was available as a four-door saloon, an estate (introduced in late 2005, known as the SportWagon, SportCombi or Sport-Hatch dependant on the market), and a two-door convertible (introduced in 2004). It included Saab Active Head Restraints (SAHR II) to reduce whiplash and ReAxs, a passive rear wheel steering design and passive <b>toe-in</b> to help reduce understeer under heavy braking.|$|E

5000|$|The second {{returned}} to the pure twin keeled and twin rudder model of the pioneering Bluebird, but as it was designed in the early 1960s, it {{had the benefit of}} forty more years of naval engineering development. [...] (Rather than being canoe-sterned, it had a small transom.) The total performance gains by this Bluebird of Thorne over Riverdale's previous twin keelers was about 15%. One performance [...] "tweak" [...] was giving slight <b>toe-in</b> to the keels to produce better upwind performance. Her ocean handling was considered to be safer than similar single-keeled craft as she rolls less, and is hence less likely to broach going downwind.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the front}} {{anti-dive}} geometry which was introduded on the Lotus 31, and the rear anti-squat geometry with unparallel radius arms (that counters the rear camber and <b>toe-in</b> reductions under braking) which was introduced with the 41C, were fully developed on the 41X (which had multiple suspension arm attachment points), and the setup {{found to be}} the best is incorporated into the 59 frame. While the 59 used Triumph Herald front uprights, the 59B used the Formula Two version Lotus 41X uprights and brakes shared with Lotus 47A. Hubs and wheels were knock-off type with spin-on central lock nut, except for the Formula Ford version, which had the Ford production 4 lugnut configuration as per the formula.|$|E
50|$|Tires are modeled in much detail. The game {{keeps track}} of 3 {{temperatures}} for each tire, reflecting temperatures at the center, inner, and outer edges. Numerous variables can influence tire temperatures. For example, an underinflated tire will tend to heat more at the edges rather than the center. An incorrect camber setting can cause one edge to heat more than the other. Temperatures are also influenced by many other factors such as weight distribution, <b>toe-in,</b> driver behavior, and the cornering characteristics of the race track. Tires in the game perform optimally at elevated temperatures, but if they heat excessively this effect is lost. The player can view current tire temperatures using an in-game keyboard command.|$|E
50|$|When a {{wheel is}} set up to have some camber angle, the {{interaction}} between the tire and road surface causes the wheel to tend to want to roll in a curve, as if it were part of a conical surface (camber thrust). This tendency to turn increases the rolling resistance as well as increasing tire wear. A small degree of toe (toe-out for negative camber, <b>toe-in</b> for positive camber) will cancel this turning tendency, reducing wear and rolling resistance. On some competition vehicles such as go-karts, especially where power is extremely limited and is highly regulated by the rules of the sport, these effects can become very significant in terms of competitiveness and performance.Toe-in and toe-out give the steering stability.|$|E
50|$|The {{potential}} advantages of hip resurfacing compared to THR include less bone removal (bone preservation), a reduced chance of hip dislocation {{due to a}} relatively larger femoral head size (given that the patient has an anatomically correct femoral head size), and easier revision surgery for any subsequent revision to a THR device because a surgeon will have more original bone stock available The potential disadvantages of hip resurfacing are femoral neck fractures (rate of 0-4%), aseptic loosening, and metal wear.Due to the retention of the patient's complete femoral neck other advantages exist: Surgeon induced discrepancies in leg length (as could happen with THR) are now minimized. Also, the <b>toe-in</b> or toe-out faults that could occur interoperatively with THR are now over because the femoral neck that determines foot direction is left undisturbed with hip resurfacing.|$|E
5000|$|The 2004 model S2000 {{underwent}} several significant changes. Production {{moved to}} Suzuka. The new model introduced 17 in wheels and Bridgestone RE-050 tires {{along with a}} retuned suspension to reduce oversteer.

50|$|Castor {{wind-off}} at {{the front}} during braking is handled by McLaren's proprietary Ground Plane Shear Centre - the wishbones on either side in the subframe are fixed in rigid plane bearings and connected to the body by four independent bushes which are 25 times more stiff radially than axially. This solution provides for a castor wind-off measured to 1.02 degrees per g of braking deceleration. Compare the Honda NSX at 2.91 degrees per g, the Porsche 928 S at 3.60 degrees per g and the Jaguar XJ6 at 4.30 degrees per g respectively. The difference in toe and camber values are also of very small under lateral force application. Inclined Shear Axis is used {{at the rear of}} the machine provides measurements of 0.04 degrees per g of change in <b>toe-in</b> under braking and 0.08 degrees per g of toe-out under traction.|$|E
5000|$|Bump steer - {{the effect}} of {{irregularity}} of a road surface on the angle or motion of a car. It {{may be the result}} of the kinematic motion of the suspension rising or falling, causing <b>toe-in</b> or toe-out at the loaded wheel, ultimately affecting the yaw angle (heading) of the car. It may also be caused by defective or worn out suspension components. This will always happen under some conditions but depends on suspension, steering linkage, unsprung weight, angular inertia, differential type, frame rigidity, tires and tire pressures. If suspension travel is exhausted the wheel either bottoms or loses contact with the road. As with hard turning on flat roads, it is better if the wheel picks up by the spring reaching its neutral shape, rather than by suddenly contacting a limiting structure of the suspension.|$|E

The smaller primary chamber is engineered to cancel the turbo lag at low engine speeds. At higher revolutions the secondary chamber is opened, pumping out 33% more power than the naturally aspirated counterpart. The Turbo 2 also has an air-to-air intercooler which has a dedicated intake on the hood. The intake is slightly offset toward {{the left side of the}} hood.|$|E

5000|$|The {{interesting}} {{rear suspension}} permits independent action of each wheel. Vertical {{movements of the}} wheels are controlled by two links, in which the upper link doubles as the axle shaft; and a rod, rubber bushed on each end as the lower. A third link runs from each rear wheel hub forward to the frame to transmit driving and braking thrust. Variable rate coil springs unitized with direct, double-acting shock absorbers are diagonally mounted at each rear wheel. Adjustment provisions in the rear suspension linkage permit variations in camber and <b>toe-in</b> to facilitate engineering studies. Front suspension is independent with high roll center geometry, and also utilizes unitized variable rate coil springs and shock absorbers as in the rear suspension. An 11/16" [...] stabilizer bar interconnects the front wheels. The independent rear suspension design became {{the basis of the}} 1963 Corvette Sting Ray suspension. So that weight distribution during tests shall vary little if any, two fuel cells of rubber construction and total capacity of 20 gallons, are located {{on either side of the}} [...] "CERV-I" [...] at approximately the fore and aft location of the center of gravity. Thus, the amount of fuel in the tanks at any given moment will have virtually no effect on weight distribution.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{surfboards}} {{intended for}} larger waves are longer (to increase hull speed for paddling, wave-catching, and surfing), and as most shapers orient the rail fins toward {{the nose of}} the board, a longer board inherently results in reduced <b>toe-in</b> of rail fins, therefore less negative angle of attack, less oscillation, greater stability, and higher speeds. Rail fins also typically have some degree of [...] "cant," [...] that is, are tilted out toward the rail they are adjacent to. This is a significant additional factor in lift at various attitudes, drag, and performance, as are the variables of other foils - including flexibility, thickness, and planform. Rail fins evolved into being and surged into popularity as riders (Simon Anderson, most famously) sought a solution to two major performance issues of a central [...] "single" [...] fin - both related to engagement of the foil: For one, a centrally-mounted fin is tilted up out of the water as the board is leaned over, and thus it loses more and more of its lift as the lean angle increases - if the lean angle is acute enough, the fin's tip can be the only area left in the water; the tip may then rapidly stall and, having lost its lift, become disengaged from the water, leaving the board's bottom as the only control surface still operating. Before rail fins became (extremely) popular, this tendency of [...] "single fins" [...] led to riders [...] "nursing" [...] turns - this tendency was a significant limiting factor on performance. The enhanced hold offered by rail fins during turning led to more types of maneuvers being possible. The other major issue leading to rail fins' use is the fact that a rider can use the lift near the rail to increase speed and performance on smaller waves due to the above effects and abilities of these foils.|$|E

30|$|Relative to neutral, {{landing in}} the <b>toe-in</b> {{position}} increased peak hip adduction, knee internal rotation angles and moments (p[*]<[*] 0.01), and peak knee abduction angle (p[*]<[*] 0.001). Landing in the <b>toe-in</b> position also decreased peak hip flexion angle (p[*]<[*] 0.001) and knee flexion angle (p[*]=[*] 0.023). Landing in the toe-out position decreased peak hip adduction, knee abduction, and knee internal rotation angles (all p[*]<[*] 0.001).

30|$|Excessive knee {{abduction}} during {{cutting and}} landing activities increases ACL injury risk (Hewett et al. 1999). We found that landing in a <b>toe-in</b> position increases knee abduction angle. Furthermore, landing in a <b>toe-in</b> position increases hip adduction angle and moment, which {{are associated with}} increased risk of ACL injury (Boden et al. 2009; Hewett et al. 2009). Landing at <b>toe-in</b> was also found to increase tibial internal rotation angle and moment. Biomechanical and MRI {{studies have shown that}} greater internal tibial rotation increases ACL load (Fung et al. 2007; Fung and Zhang 2003; Markolf et al. 1995). Furthermore, tibial internal rotation combined with knee valgus was found to increase ACL strain more than either individually (Shin et al. 2011). These findings suggest that an excessive <b>toe-in</b> landing position should be avoided and may be a target for movement pattern modification.|$|E
