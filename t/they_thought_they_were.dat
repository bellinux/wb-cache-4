5|$|When {{his mother}} left the group, Guest moved {{back with her}} to the United Kingdom. Guest, his mother and {{stepfather}} Martin moved to north London, and he began the process of experiencing adolescence in a society different from that inside the Rajneesh movement. Guest reentered society at age 11, and faced confusion over the contrast in experiences between his childhood in the Rajneesh movement and his new experiences as a teenager in London. He enrolled in the Haverstock School in north London, but had trouble during his teen years with drugs and alcohol. He had difficult relations with his stepfather, and had not spent much time with him prior to the move to London. Anne and Martin went through a period of time where <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> beings from a different world, and read books on UFOs. Guest fostered his interest in reading, and went on to study at university.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} ship began its homeward voyage Christian and his discontented {{followers}} seized Bligh and {{took control of}} the vessel. Bligh and 18 loyalists were set adrift in an open boat; Heywood was among those who remained with Bounty. Later, he and 15 others left the ship and settled in Tahiti, while Bounty sailed on, ending its voyage at Pitcairn Island. Bligh, after an epic open-boat journey, eventually reached England, where he implicated Heywood as one of the mutiny's prime instigators. In 1791 Heywood and his companions were met with in Tahiti by the search vessel , and held in irons for transportation to England. Heywood and one other actually went out to the Pandora in canoes , very happy to be rescued-as <b>they</b> <b>thought.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> then arrested and treated barbarously by the Captain, Edward Edwards, who had them and 12 others fettered and handcuffed in an 11 ft. box built for the purpose on deck. Their subsequent journey was prolonged and eventful; Pandora was wrecked on the Great Barrier Reef, four of Heywood's fellow prisoners were drowned, and Heywood himself was fortunate to survive, being the 3rd last {{to get out of the}} box, which had only an exit 18 inches sq. in the roof..|$|E

25|$|On {{the first}} day, the inquest {{heard that the}} police {{officers}} who shot Menezes dead were 'convinced' {{at the time that}} he was a suicide bomber. In his comments, Sir Michael Wright said that the two officers thought Menezes was about to detonate a 'device' on the Tube. He took the inquest jury through the events leading up to Menezes's death, listing a number of occasions where officers were unclear whether or not <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> pursuing a bomber. The jury was told of differences between what was being relayed on radio and logged in the Scotland Yard control room and how the officers in the field were interpreting the information.|$|E

[...] There's more bloodshed coming. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> safe on this farm, they were wrong. [...] We're on a killing spree here.

500|$|Liberty lists {{a number}} of Marquis' claims about the Cheyenne that are either doubted or are just {{generally}} little known. First among these is that the Sioux believed, according to Marquis, that the Great Sioux War of 1876 was a war against the Cheyenne by the United States. The US certainly thought they were mainly fighting the Sioux, and the conventional view of historians is that the Sioux were central to the action. Without doubt, the Sioux had {{the greatest number of}} participants on the Indian side, but, according to Marquis, <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> merely coming to the aid of their allies the Cheyenne. Liberty points out that the Sioux would have had some justification in this belief; the number of Cheyenne villages destroyed far exceeded the number of Sioux villages, even though the Cheyenne were fewer in number. Liberty includes this idea within her overall concept of [...] "Cheyenne Primacy"– that the Cheyennes were the most important group in the historical development of the Northern Plains.|$|E

500|$|Paris's Théâtre des Champs-Élysées {{was a new}} structure, {{which had}} opened on 2 April 1913 with a {{programme}} celebrating the works {{of many of the}} leading composers of the day. The theatre's manager, Gabriel Astruc, was determined to house the 1913 Ballets Russes season, and paid Diaghilev the large sum of 25,000 francs per performance, double what he had paid the previous year. [...] The programme for 29 May 1913, as well as the Stravinsky premiere, [...] included Les Sylphides, Weber's Le Spectre de la Rose and Borodin's Polovtsian Dances. Ticket sales for the evening, ticket prices being doubled for a premiere, amounted to 35,000 francs. Final rehearsals were held on the day before the premiere, in the presence of members of the press and assorted invited guests. According to Stravinsky all went peacefully. However, the critic of L'Écho de Paris, Adolphe Boschot, foresaw possible trouble; he wondered how the public would receive the work, and suggested that they might react badly if <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> being mocked.|$|E
500|$|Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II was {{developed}} by UK-based computer game company Zippo Games, headed by Ste and John Pickford; {{this was the first}} game Zippo developed for fellow UK-based video game company Rare. At the time, Zippo Games had just completed a previous game titled Cosmic Pirate - a game that was published by Palace Software and released for the Commodore64, AtariST, and Amiga in 1988. New to the technical capabilities of the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Pickford brothers visited Rare and were pleased with their NES library, though <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> backtracking by deciding to develop games for the console. According to Ste Pickford: [...] "The NES seemed primitive by comparison, sub-Commodore64. But the games were ten times better than everything being released for home computers, which we appreciated, and we wanted to try to make games as good as that." [...] Rare decided to hire Zippo Games to develop this Wizards & Warriors sequel; Pickford remarked: [...] "Rare showed us Wizards & Warriors and asked us to develop the sequel, and pretty much left us to it." [...] Rare felt that Zippo Games was trustworthy enough to develop the sequel without much help from them.|$|E

Love also said, [...] "It {{was all about the}} expression of my experience. I was not coming from a black void; I was trying to create light... I was trying to heal." [...] In an interview with Spin magazine several years after its release, Love said that she was [...] "posing in a lot of ways" [...] with the album: [...] "It was the truth, but it was also me catching up with all my hip peers who'd gone all indie on me, and who made fun of me for liking R.E.M. and The Smiths. I'd done the whole punk thing, sleeping on floors in piss and beer, and waking up with the guy with the fucking mohawk and the skateboards and the speed and the whole goddamned thing. But I hated it. I'd grown out of it by the time I was seventeen." [...] In a 1994 interview with Kurt Loder, Love admitted to having been [...] "consciously self-conscious" [...] when making the record due to her feeling the need to compete with her peers at the time.|$|E

We amused ourselves. They would be around for a while, then they would disappear. [...] Back then, bohemianism [...] was the pursuit of liberation, of a splash of sincerity, and not total hypocrisy. Such was the need for bohemianism. Not necessarily that of a marginalized or impoverished type. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> much freer, much more sincere, much more authentic toward their condition, toward their creation.

Justice Bert Röling, who represented the Netherlands at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, noted that [...] "many of the commanders and guards in POW camps were Koreans – the Japanese apparently did not trust them as soldiers – and it is said that they were sometimes far more cruel than the Japanese." [...] In his memoirs, Colonel Eugene C. Jacobs wrote that during the Bataan Death March, [...] "the Korean guards were the most abusive.
