5|$|Some stampeders were famous: John McGraw, {{the former}} {{governor}} of Washington joined, together with the prominent lawyer and sportsman A. Balliot. Frederick Burnham, a well-known American scout and explorer, arrived from Africa, only to be called back {{to take part in the}} Second Boer War. Among those who documented <b>the</b> <b>rush</b> were the Swedish-born photographer Eric Hegg, who took some of the iconic pictures of Chilkoot Pass, and reporter Tappan Adney, who afterwards wrote a first-hand history of the stampede. Jack London, later a famous American writer, left to seek for gold but made his money during <b>the</b> <b>rush</b> mostly by working for prospectors.|$|E

Dawson declined in size again as many of the immigrants left, but it was appointed the Territorial Capital of the new Yukon Territory in 1900, and by the following year it had a stable population of around 10,000.|$|E

5|$|Mitchell {{plays in}} the style of a stay-at-home defenceman. While with the Vancouver Canucks, he {{established}} himself as their top shutdown defenceman, being matched up against opposing teams' best players and spending significant time on the penalty kill. He had usually formed a defensive pairing on the Canucks with the often offensive-minded Kevin Bieksa. Bieksa has credited Mitchell with teaching him to be more aware of game situations before jumping into <b>the</b> <b>rush.</b>|$|E
5|$|San Francisco {{had been}} a tiny {{settlement}} before <b>the</b> <b>rush</b> began. When residents learned about the discovery, it at first became a ghost town of abandoned ships and businesses, but then boomed as merchants and new people arrived. The population of San Francisco exploded from perhaps about 1,000 in 1848 to 25,000 full-time residents by 1850. Miners lived in tents, wood shanties, or deck cabins removed from abandoned ships.|$|E

On 7 June, two trams collided at low speed at Byparken, causing a derailment and forced the two trams to be repaired. This caused the summer schedule to {{be reduced to a}} 30-minute headway. From 1 November, the line started running every six minutes during <b>the</b> <b>rush</b> hour. On 22 June, {{the first part of the}} line was officially opened by Queen Sonja of Norway.|$|E

5|$|Clemson's {{defense was}} strongest against <b>the</b> <b>rush.</b> During the regular season, the Tigers allowed {{an average of}} 101.8 yards per game on the ground, good enough for No. 18 nationally.

On average, the Tigers allowed 238.6 yards per game through the air, making their pass defense the 97th best in {{division}} I-A football during the regular season. With both categories combined, the defense was ranked No. 37. In terms of points allowed, rather than yardage, the Tigers were ranked No. 23 after giving up an average of 19.3 yards per game.|$|E

By the time Franklin returned to the Brindabellas in 1863, the indigenous population had been significantly reduced.|$|E

5|$|From 1898, the {{newspapers}} that had encouraged so many {{to travel to}} the Klondike lost interest in it. In the summer of 1899, gold was discovered around Nome in west Alaska, and many prospectors left the Klondike for the new goldfields, marking the end of <b>the</b> <b>rush.</b> The boom towns declined and the population of Dawson City fell. Gold mining activity lasted until 1903 when production peaked after heavier equipment was brought in. Since then the Klondike has been mined on and off, and today the legacy draws tourists to the region and contributes to its prosperity.|$|E
5|$|Goldsmith scored The Motion Picture over {{a period}} of three to four months, a {{relatively}} relaxed schedule compared to typical production, but time pressures resulted in Goldsmith bringing on colleagues to assist in the work. Alexander Courage, composer of the original Star Trek theme, provided arrangements to accompany Kirk's log entries, while Fred Steiner wrote eleven cues of additional music, notably the music to accompany the Enterprise achieving warp speed and first meeting V'Ger. <b>The</b> <b>rush</b> to finish the rest of the film impacted the score.

Walternate, watching the altercation on monitors, notes Olivia has gained the marksmanship ability that the alternate Olivia possesses, and begins to think the serum is working. Brandon (Ryan McDonald) theorizes in a later conversation that <b>the</b> <b>rush</b> of adrenaline effectively enhanced the potency of his chemical agents to brainwash Olivia.|$|E
