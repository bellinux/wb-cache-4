5|$|In the break, {{a number}} of Central Europeans, {{including}} Vuilleumier and Bruno Trojani, asked for top speed. This was protested by the Scandinavian and United States jumpers, and a 40-minute discussion broke out. At one point, one of the facilitators at the in-run received a telephone call confirming top speed. The facilitator was skeptical, and chose <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>back</b> to the judges, who could confirm {{that they had not}} given such a go-ahead. In the end, the judges chose to allow higher speeds, with a compromise of 5.0meters more distance. However, the facilitator only moved the rope 4.5meters. This made the Swiss furious, and they used their knives to cut the rope. They then accused the participants who were opposed to full speed of being cowards.|$|E

Four other cities of Tochigi did already stop with the sales and shipments of the mushrooms grown there. The farmers were asked to stop all shipments and <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>back</b> the mushrooms already on the market.|$|E
25|$|The paguli was {{a ritual}} {{performed}} when all efforts {{to heal the}} moribund had failed, in an effort <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>back</b> the departed soul (1). A coconut shell of water was set upon the dying person’s stomach and was rotated to the chant: “Come back, soul, come back” as noted by Alcina in 1668. In {{the case of a}} datu, some slaves could be sacrificed to appease ancestor spirits.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{receipt of}} the report, Turnage decided to {{establish}} a platoon-sized outpost on the hill and the following morning a force from the 3rd Battalion, 21st Marines, which included heavy weapons support and an artillery forward observer, was sent out to occupy it. The Japanese, however, had returned during the night following the battle and had retaken the position and established themselves firmly. Heavy fire prevented the Marines from advancing and forced them <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>back</b> to regimental headquarters for reinforcements.|$|E
25|$|The reorganizing {{also made}} a drastic change to the {{corporate}} culture. While ND previously had allowed {{a high degree of}} autonomy for its employees and divisions, issues became increasingly top-managed. Motivation and sales dropped, and the company lost much of its ability to get employees to work free overtime. In early 1991 a new round of layoffs was carried through, followed by a new reorganization. New control mechanisms were introduced to ensure that all employees understood the new model. Few employees would admit to not understanding it, but in reality most did not, enhancing the problem. New rounds of lay-offs took place in June and September, the latter consisting of 500 people. ND lost all its large customers and signed no large contracts in 1990 and 1991. One of the main reasons was that sales personnel were forced <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>back</b> to the office to confirm every step in negotiations.|$|E
25|$|At 6:00 PM on July 23, Forbes and Beach {{drove to}} the Afro Culture Shop and Bookstore at 11105 Superior Avenue to see Evans. Not finding him there, they {{drove to the}} Evans' {{apartment}} at 12312 Auburndale Avenue and were {{surprised to discover that}} the Cleveland Police had, in fact, established a stationary surveillance around Evans' home. One unmarked car with white officers sat on Lakeview Avenue between Moulton and Auburndale, and another with white officers sat at the intersection of Auburndale and E. 124th Street. At 7:50 PM, Forbes and Beach arrived at Evans' home. They talked with him for 15 minutes, during which time Evans expressed his anxiety about the police and his concern {{that he was going to}} be harassed again. Forbes attempted to have the stationary surveillance removed, but was advised by the city's Safety Director, James McManamon, to speak with Mayor Stokes. Forbes reached Stokes, but Stokes was interrupted by another call and asked Forbes <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>back</b> in 15 minutes. During this time, Forbes drove to the home of Harllel Jones, an Evans associate. While speaking with Jones, they learned that the shootout had begun.|$|E

500|$|Captain Cooper of Anderson {{first called}} the USCG in Sault Ste. Marie at 7:39p.m. on channel16, the radio {{distress}} frequency. The USCG responders instructed him <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>back</b> on channel12 {{because they wanted}} to keep their emergency channel open and they were having difficulty with their communication systems, including antennas blown down by the storm. Cooper then contacted the upbound saltwater vessel Nanfri and was told that she could not pick up Fitzgerald on her radar. Despite repeated attempts to raise the USCG, Cooper was not successful until 7:54p.m. when the officer on duty asked him to keep watch for a [...] boat lost in the area. At about 8:25p.m., Cooper again called the USCG to express his concern about Fitzgerald and at 9:03p.m. reported her missing. Petty Officer Philip Branch later testified, [...] "I considered it serious, but {{at the time it was}} not urgent." ...|$|E
500|$|Kemper {{then left}} the scene in Hallett's car, driving eastward, leaving California and through Nevada and Utah. He arrived in Pueblo, Colorado and, after not hearing any news on the radio about the murders {{of his mother and}} Hallett, found a phone booth and called the police. He confessed to the murders of his mother and Hallett, but the police did not take his call seriously and told him <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>back</b> at a later time. Several hours later, Kemper called again asking to speak to an officer he {{personally}} knew. Kemper then confessed to that officer of killing his mother and Hallett, and waited in his car for the police to arrive, arrest him and take him into custody, where he then also confessed to the murders of the six students. When asked after his arrest what motivated him to turn himself in, Kemper said: [...] "The original purpose was gone... It wasn't serving any physical or real or emotional purpose. It was just a pure waste of time... Emotionally, I couldn't handle it much longer. Toward the end there, I started feeling the folly of the whole damn thing, and at the point of near exhaustion, near collapse, I just said to hell with it and called it all off." ...|$|E
500|$|Vig started doubting {{it could}} be done fully analog once the tapes for the first song recorded, [...] "Miss the Misery", started falling apart, but Grohl {{reassured}} him [...] "no, Butch, I don't want any computer in this house at all." [...] The producer said that during recording he [...] "had to force my brain to fire different synapses" [...] to remember {{how to deal with the}} analog equipment and the lack of a digital display. One of the habits Vig had <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>back</b> was editing using a razor blade—"I used to be able to do 20 edits in half an hour if need be. It took me about 20 minutes to do the first edit!"—a technique he employed for the first songs recorded. Eventually he gave up and decided to punch in and punch out tapes instead, as the process was time-consuming and a more editable tape sent to Vig from Smart Studios was mostly ruined by one of Grohl's daughters. While many recordings had inserts and some parts rerecorded, the only song that had to be redone from scratch was [...] "I Should Have Known", as Grohl felt Vig was [...] "trying to make this into a radio single" [...] when the singer wanted it [...] "to sound really raw and primal".|$|E

500|$|Swift was {{inspired}} to write [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] about her experience with a boy named Drew Hardwick, a classmate of hers whom she had feelings for. Hardwick later went on to join the Navy. During their freshman {{year of high school}} at Hendersonville High School, Swift and Hardwick sat beside each other in a class everyday. The two developed a fond friendship, although Swift secretively desired for it to become a romantic relationship. Because of Hardwick's unawareness, he would frequently speak to Swift about a girl he had feelings for, something Swift pretended to be endeared by, commenting, [...] "How beautiful she was, how nice and smart and perfect she was. And I sat there and listened, never meaning it any of the times I said 'Oh, I'm so happy for you.'" [...] Hardwick and his love interest eventually developed a relationship which lasted for a few years. Swift never confessed her feelings to him. By the release of Taylor Swift, he remained unaware of Swift's intentions or the song and continued his relationship with the same female. Upon [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar"'s release as a single, Hardwick attempted to contact Swift via phone calls, which Swift did not respond to; he then left voicemails, but Swift felt too awkward <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E

2500|$|With his ABA career over {{following}} {{the playoffs in}} 1972, Strom contacted Nucatola to get an NBA contract signed for the 1972–73 NBA season. Nucatola told Strom <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>back</b> after {{the conclusion of the}} 1972 NBA Playoffs. Strom called Nucatola {{following the}} NBA playoffs, but was told to [...] "wait a little longer." [...] Strom continued to have difficulties with Nucatola {{over the next several months}} and finally sought the assistance of Richie Phillips, a Philadelphia attorney and NBA player representative. Strom filed a $275,000 suit against the NBA in December 1972 for breach of an oral contract when John Nucatola told Strom that he could return to the league. The league filed preliminary objections to have the suit dismissed, but were overruled by the court. The NBA then moved for summary judgment which was denied. Concerned that there could be legitimate action taken, the NBA decided to give Strom his job back if he dropped the suit. Strom agreed to the terms and signed a contract before the start of the 1973–74 NBA season.|$|E

In the second series, she voiced another character named Siune; both series were broadcast on the Toonami block on Adult Swim. She also began attending anime conventions as a guest panelist. In voicing [...] in the [...] series, Harlacher found her character to be not your average princess, and that she was fun because she was unpredictable. Her biggest role that year was Ami Kawashima in the romantic comedy Toradora!, a classmate who harbors a mean and bratty personality behind a cheerful perfect-looking facade of a model. As it was one of NIS America's first dub productions, Harlacher said took a long time <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>back</b> from the audition, and that it also took more time than other studios in producing the show.

In May 1501, with a force of 8 galliots and 13 fustas, he escorted the cargo ships carrying construction material for strengthening the Ottoman fortresses on the islands of Chios and Tinos, where he captured the galley of Girolamo Pisani, the local Venetian commander, including the official standard of San Marco (St. Mark, the patron saint of Venice) along with another Venetian galley named [...] "Basadonna". From there he sailed to the port of Zonchio, near Navarino, with a force of 5 galliots and 14 fustas. The Ottoman forces landed there and captured the Venetian castle and the nearby settlements after a siege which lasted less than 10 hours. Kemal Reis also captured 3 Venetian galleys, a Venetian caravelle and several other local ships which were docked at the port of Zonchio. He took these ships first to Modon and later to the Island of Aegina, before sailing towards Euboea. He later captured Navarino from the Venetians, adding another important port to the Ottoman Empire.
