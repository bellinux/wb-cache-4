Since then, a total of 75 these communities have been founded in 44 countries, either directly by Marthe herself or inspired by her example.

5|$|In {{addition}} to being used as {{the exterior of the}} school, Studio C holds sets for the school's entrance foyer, the gymnasium, the media lab and a hallway with lockers.

For the first few seasons, the gym floor was made of real wooden floorboards; due to warping, it was replaced by concrete painted to look like wood.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>foyer</b> of {{the tower}} was {{originally}} planned to be an open-air forecourt between {{the building and the}} remains of the Palace Hotel, however extensive aeroelastic wind testing of the structure by the Institute of Environmental Sciences at Murdoch University forced this area to be covered with a glass canopy. Mocks of the curtain walls {{to be used in the}} tower were also tested to 1.5 times the proof load to ensure they could withstand cyclone-force weather and seismic shocks. The building is clad with green-tinted double-pane glass on windows, with the service core and structure of the building covered with aluminium sheeting skin coated with a light grey fluoropolymer paint.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, {{a studio}} theatre was {{built at the}} rear of the {{building}} on Monmouth Street, called the Ustinov Studio, named after the actor Peter Ustinov. The front of the building is decorated with a bronze winged figure which was designed by his son, Igor Ustinov, entitled Hopefully. The 150-seat auditorium was originally a space for the youth theatre and small-scale touring productions, but the Ustinov programme soon expanded to encompass classical concerts, stand-up comedy (including high-profile acts such as Bill Bailey, Stewart Lee and Lucy Porter) and in-house productions. To accommodate the technical needs of these productions, a refurbishment was planned to take place throughout 2007, improving the backstage & technical facilities, <b>the</b> <b>foyer,</b> bar and auditorium. The Ustinov Studio re-opened in February 2008, with their own production of Breakfast With Mugabe, starring Joseph Marcell, Miles Anderson and Nicholas Bailey.|$|E

Scully and Pfaster have a struggle that sends them falling down a staircase onto <b>the</b> <b>foyer,</b> where a task force led by Mulder and Bocks breaks in moments later and apprehends Pfaster. Scully initially insists that she is okay, but then breaks down and cries in Mulder's arms.

A nationwide plan to renovate <b>the</b> <b>foyers</b> presents distinct {{challenges to the}} arrangements established by the generations of migrants who live in them, arrangements that have long sustained the social reproduction of transnational migration. In response, residents foreground their long-established presence in Paris to stake claims in the renovation process. Their stories of urban dwelling are punctuated by postal addresses, bureaucratic tokens of identification that play a pivotal role both in migrants’ historical imagination and in the administrative modes of granting residency rights. <b>The</b> <b>foyers</b> are sites of emplacement, albeit fragile, and spaces from which West African migrants contest their political exclusion in present-day Franc...|$|R
50|$|The lobby {{mezzanine}} {{was closed}} off to create office space in 1962.

5|$|The {{game was}} first {{revealed}} at Nintendo Space World 2000 as a technological demo designed {{to show off}} the graphical capabilities of the GameCube. The full motion video footage had scenes seen in later trailers and commercials for the game, but were never used in the final release. This footage includes Luigi running from an unknown ghost in <b>the</b> <b>Foyer,</b> ghosts playing cards in the Parlor, ghosts circling around Luigi, and Luigi standing outside the mansion with lighting flashing. Soon after its creation, Nintendo decided to make the demo into a full-fledged video game. A year later, Luigi's Mansion was later shown at the Electronic Entertainment Expo alongside the GameCube console. A newer version of the game, more closely related to the final version, was later revealed at Nintendo Space World 2001.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan was}} for a {{flexible}} theatre complex, where up to ten areas are available for performance. Tom Morris has cited as inspiration the Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord in Paris. The main auditorium gained an optional thrust stage, {{and an increase in}} seating to 540. The Side Stage area was redeveloped, with additional capacity of 250, creating the option of a separate second auditorium. Other spaces redeveloped as performance areas included the Paint Shop and the rehearsal room. The Theatre Royal re-opened in September 2012, with Wild Oats. Further work (mainly in the area of <b>the</b> <b>foyer)</b> is planned for the refurbishment's next phase, to be completed in 2016, to coincide with the 250th anniversary of the theatre opening.|$|E
5|$|The single's {{music video}} was co-directed by Carey and Daniel Pearl. It was {{inspired}} by the Tennessee Williams play Baby Doll and a dream Carey had one night. The video begins with scenes of a man leaving his home one early morning; only his feet are shown. Carey is first seen residing in the derelict house, {{in the middle of a}} large meadow. She awakes, sad and depressed, wearing battered and disheveled clothing. As she walks down the stairs, Carey sits on the staircase, lamenting in agony at her loneliness. As the video climaxes, Carey is seen finally leaving <b>the</b> <b>foyer,</b> apparently for the first time in many years, escaping from the misery she once called home. As she reaches the outskirts of the property, Carey mounts a horse, which assists her in jumping over the barbed fence. After leaving, Carey is seen smiling for the first time in the video, while waiving her arms in the air.|$|E

5000|$|The {{building}} is often classified as art deco, though its overall architectural style is technically [...] "Late 20th Century Stripped Classical", {{the style of}} ancient Greece and Rome but simplified and modernised.
