5|$|The {{election}} {{was called for}} 17 September 1878. Fearful that Macdonald would be defeated in Kingston, his supporters <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> {{to run in the}} safe Conservative riding of Cardwell; having represented his hometown for 35years, he stood there again. In the election, Macdonald was defeated in his riding by Alexander Gunn, but the Conservatives swept to victory. Macdonald remained in the House of Commons, having quickly secured his election for Marquette, Manitoba; elections there were held later than in Ontario. His acceptance of office vacated his parliamentary seat, and Macdonald decided to stand for the British Columbia seat of Victoria, where the {{election was}} to be held on 21 October. Macdonald was duly returned for Victoria, although he had never visited either Marquette or Victoria.|$|E

It received a mix of positive and very critical reviews.|$|E
25|$|Newkirk {{helped her}} mother {{out in the}} leper colony—packing pills and rolling bandages, {{stuffing}} toys for orphans, and feeding strays—and says that this informed her view that anyone in need, including animals, was worthy of concern, along with her mother's advice that it doesn't matter who suffers, but how. She {{tells the story of}} an early experience of trying to rescue an animal, when she heard laughter in the alleyway behind the family home in New Delhi. A group of people had bound a dog's legs, muzzled him, then lowered him into a muddy ditch, laughing as they watched him try to escape. Newkirk asked her servant to bring the dog to her, and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> to drink some water, but someone had packed his throat with mud, and he died in her arms. She told the Financial Times that it was a turning point.|$|E
25|$|Haig was in England from 12 March. On 14 March, at {{a meeting}} at Downing Street, warning of serious {{manpower}} problems by June “if (sic) the Germans attacked”. Bonar Law and Lloyd George, by Haig’s account, <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> {{to say that the}} Germans would not attack. They accused Haig of having said that there would not be a major German offensive (which was not actually what he had said – he had said it would be “a gambler’s throw”) but agreed to shelve the General Reserve for the time being until enough American troops had arrived. On the same day Haig attended two long sessions of the Supreme War Council (at one of which, to his amusement, Clemenceau told Foch to shut up). On 15 Haig took part in a long discussion about the bombing of German cities, which he regarded as a waste of effort. That night Doris gave birth to his son Dawyck. He returned to France the next day.|$|E

25|$|In {{the next}} 2009–10 season, he again had to {{battle with a}} couple of injuries. But during the season he was still able to play another 28 games for Feyenoord, where he scored a total of 12 goals, and thereby {{qualified}} to become the top scorer of Feyenoord. With his good performance on the field, he helped Feyenoord to achieve a fourth place in the Eredivisie, and qualify the club to play the final in the Dutch cup. The final was played as a double match, and clearly lost with a total score of 6–1 to Ajax, but Tomasson left a mark of his name in the history books, by scoring the one and only goal for Feyenoord. During the World Championships 2010, he was unfortunately hit by another serious injury, that spoiled his first half of the 2010–11 season for Feyenoord. According to the medical staff at Feyenoord, the injury was a lot worse than original thought. When they <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> ready for a game at 15 August, the injury had not entirely healed; and after a too hard training session, it therefore reappeared at its previous strength. Based upon further examination of the injury, the coach now feared that Tomasson only would be ready to play his first game of the season in January 2011.|$|E
500|$|In a 2005 {{lecture at}} Harvard after Jackson's trial, Jackson's {{attorney}} Thomas Mesereau said the following about Jordan Chandler: [...] "The prosecutors <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> {{to show up}} and he wouldn't. If he had, I had witnesses who were {{going to come in and}} say he told them it never happened and that he would never talk to his parents again for what they made him say. It turned out he'd gone into court and got legal emancipation from his parents." [...] In 2006, Jordan accused Evan of attacking him with a barbell, choking him and spraying his face with Mace. The charges were later dropped. On November 5, 2009, fourteen weeks after Jackson's death, Evan Chandler was found dead following an apparent suicide.|$|E
500|$|The People v. Jackson {{trial began}} in Santa Maria, California, on January 31, 2005. During the trial, the judge allowed {{testimony}} about past allegations, including the 1993 case, to establish whether the defendant had a propensity to commit certain crimes. However, Jordan Chandler {{had left the}} country to avoid testifying. In a lecture at Harvard after the trial, Thomas Mesereau said, [...] "The prosecutors <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> {{to show up and}} he wouldn't. If he had, I had witnesses who were {{going to come in and}} say he told them it never happened and that he would never talk to his parents again for what they made him say. It turned out he'd gone into court and got legal emancipation from his parents." [...] June Chandler testified that she had npt spoken to her son in 11 years. At one point in her testimony, she claimed that she could not remember being sued by Jackson (who had counter-sued for extortion) and at another point said that she had never heard of her own attorney. However, she said she never witnessed any molestation.|$|E

They arrived by taxi at around 2am. Jones passed as a girl at the party, and several males danced with him. Although he initially kept his biological sex a secret from others at the party, fearing homophobic persecution, he revealed his identity to a girl {{with whom he had}} previously been to church. The girl informed her male friends, who accosted him outside the venue, demanding to know, [...] "Are you a woman or a man?" [...] One of the men used a lantern to examine Jones' feet, claiming that they were too large to be those of a biological woman. Discovering his sex, they started calling him [...] "batty boy" [...] and other homophobic epithets. Khloe <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> to avoid confrontation, whispering in his ear, [...] "Walk with me, walk with me", but Jones refused, instead insisting to those assembled that he was female.|$|E

2500|$|Despite confessions from Autry, Austin, and Dylan Adams, all men {{arrested for}} the crime have vehemently denied {{involvement}} in the disappearance at some point and have accused the state of coercive tactics. Early in the case, Autry claimed that investigators <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> to testify falsely against Zach Adams.

In contrast with the Alaskan, Smith told several businessmen he would make amends.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{documentary}} short that profiled Hank, his mother related how doctors {{had told her}} that Hank's liver was damaged, and that she didn't know how long he had to live, and that she [...] "didn't know what to do." [...] Hank had been in rehab before, as well as court-mandated detox, and it had never worked. [...] Once Hank was even kicked out of Alcoholics Anonymous because he brought into the meeting a bottle of Mad Dog 20-20 and started drinking it five seconds after the meeting started.

2500|$|Upon {{hearing of}} Yuan and Lu's deaths, Li broke off the {{peaceful}} relations with Yang Tong's regime, now under Wang's control. [...] However, {{he had a}} low opinion of Wang, so {{he did not take}} much precaution against an attack from Wang. [...] Further, other problems were developing for Li—as while he had plenty of food supplies, he had a low amount of money and silk, and therefore had little to reward his generals with. [...] He was also being overly generous with new adherents, and the old followers began to grumble. [...] When Xu Shiji <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> to change his ways, he sent Xu away to Liyang under guise of promotion. [...] In addition, his supply of new adherents began to dry up when he, in an ill-advised decision pushed by his secretary Bing Yuanzhen (邴元真), who could materially benefit from the transactions, to trade food with Wang for textiles. [...] After the transactions began, the people of Luoyang, no longer low on food, stopped surrendering to Li, and while Li stopped the transactions, the damage had been done. [...] In addition, his troops were tired, and a substantial percentage of his men were injured from fighting the elite Xiaoguo Army under Yuwen's command.|$|E

Between December 2006 and January 2007, Auvinen's parents <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> {{referred}} to a psychiatric outpatient clinic, but the offer was refused, as his symptoms were deemed mild. It was recommended that before a resort to hospitalisation, efforts to use antidepressant medication would be taken first. Pekka told his on again / off again online girlfriend Vaula Kuuluvainen {{that he would not}} be making it to military service the following months, he also left several other cryptic and homicidal messages with her before the day of his crimes. [...] Auvinen had irregularly taken SSRI-antidepressants one year prior to his death. Auvinen was frequently bullied at school, and school students reported changes in his behavior to a youth worker, saying he acted threateningly and remarked that they would die in [...] "a white revolution". One of his teachers described him as a militant radical who was interested in both far-right and far-left movements. Auvinen had apparently been planning the shooting since at least early March 2006 before he met any of the youtubers or online gamers who had later been blamed for the massacre.|$|E
