5|$|A monohedral <b>tiling</b> is a {{tessellation}} {{in which}} all tiles are congruent; it has only one prototile. A particularly interesting type of monohedral tessellation is the spiral monohedral <b>tiling.</b> The first spiral monohedral <b>tiling</b> was discovered by Heinz Voderberg in 1936; the Voderberg <b>tiling</b> has a unit tile that is a nonconvex enneagon. The Hirschhorn <b>tiling,</b> published by Michael D. Hirschhorn and D. C.

5|$|A uniform <b>tiling</b> is a <b>tiling</b> {{in which}} each tile is a regular polygon and in which every vertex can be mapped to every other vertex by a {{symmetry}} of the <b>tiling.</b> Usually, uniform tilings additionally are required to have tiles that meet edge-to-edge, but if this requirement is relaxed then there are eight additional uniform tilings.

40|$|Interleukin- 7 (IL 7) is a {{pleiotropic}} cytokine that {{is actively}} involved in the immune system. The Chinese tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri chinensis) has been proposed as an alternative experimental animal to primates in biomedical research. However, {{there is a lack of}} biological knowledge about the immune system of the tree shrew. In this study, we cloned the IL 7 gene (<b>tIL</b> 7) in the Chinese tree shrew and quantified the expression of mRNA transcripts in eight tissues (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, intestine, skeletal muscle and brain) from 20 individuals. Eleven <b>tIL</b> 7 mRNA transcripts were identified in different tissues. The canonical form (<b>tIL</b> 7 c) had a length of 1817 bp and encoded a predicted gene product with 177 amino acids. Phylogenetic analyses based on the amino acid sequences revealed a considerably large genetic difference between tree shrew and human. Quantification of mRNA expression of transcripts <b>tIL</b> 7 c, <b>tIL</b> 7 -sv 1, <b>tIL</b> 7 -sv 2 and <b>tIL</b> 7 -sv 3 showed that these transcripts were expressed in all tissues, albeit the expression levels varied in different tissues.

40|$|We {{aimed to}} assess the {{reliability}} and validity of the Therapy Intensity Level scale (<b>TIL)</b> for intracranial pressure (ICP) management. We reviewed the medical records of 31 patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in two European intensive care units (ICUs). The ICP <b>TIL</b> was derived over a 4 -day period for 4 -h (<b>TIL</b> 4) and 24 -h epochs (<b>TIL</b> 24). <b>TIL</b> scores were compared with historical schemes for <b>TIL</b> measurement, with each other, and with clinical variables. <b>TIL</b> 24 scores in ICU patients with TBI were compared with two control groups: patients with extracranial trauma necessitating intensive care (Trauma_ICU; n = 20) and patients with TBI not needing ICU care (TBI_WARD; n = 19), to further determine the discriminative validity of the <b>TIL</b> for ICP-related ICU interventions. Interrater and intraobserver agreement were excellent for <b>TIL</b> 4 and <b>TIL</b> 24 (Cohen kappa: 0. 98 - 0. 99; intraclass correlation coefficient: 0. 99 - 1; p < 0. 0005). The mean + standard deviation (SD) <b>TIL</b> 24 in the ICU TBI cohort was significantly higher than the Trauma_ICU patients and the TBI_WARD patients (8. 2 +/- 3. 2 vs. 2. 2 +/- 0. 9 and 0. 1 +/- 0. 1, respectively; p < 0. 005 for both comparisons).

5|$|In 1996, German {{mathematician}} Petra Gummelt {{demonstrated that}} a covering (so called to {{distinguish it from}} a non-overlapping <b>tiling)</b> equivalent to the Penrose <b>tiling</b> can be constructed using a single decagonal tile if two kinds of overlapping regions are allowed. The decagonal tile is decorated with colored patches, and the covering rule allows only those overlaps compatible with the coloring. A suitable decomposition of the decagonal tile into kites and darts transforms such a covering into a Penrose (P2) <b>tiling.</b> Similarly, a P3 <b>tiling</b> {{can be obtained by}} inscribing a thick rhomb into each decagon; the remaining space is filled by thin rhombs.|$|E
5|$|Penrose tilings {{are simple}} {{examples}} of aperiodic tilings {{of the plane}}. A <b>tiling</b> is a covering of the plane by tiles with no overlaps or gaps; the tiles normally have {{a finite number of}} shapes, called prototiles, and a set of prototiles is said to admit a <b>tiling</b> or tile the plane if there is a <b>tiling</b> of the plane using only tiles congruent to these prototiles. The most familiar tilings (e.g., by squares or triangles) are periodic: a perfect copy of the <b>tiling</b> can be obtained by translating all of the tiles by a fixed distance in a given direction. Such a translation is called a period of the tiling; more informally, this means that a finite region of the <b>tiling</b> repeats itself in periodic intervals. If a <b>tiling</b> has no periods it is said to be non-periodic. A set of prototiles is said to be aperiodic if it tiles the plane but every such <b>tiling</b> is non-periodic; tilings by aperiodic sets of prototiles are called aperiodic tilings.|$|E

We contribute a more detailed description of the technique, introduce <b>Tiled</b> Forward Shading (a generalization of <b>Tiled</b> Deferred Shading to also apply to forward shading), and a thorough performance evaluation. <b>Tiled</b> Forward Shading has many of the advantages of deferred shading, e. g. scene management and light management is decoupled.

The {{purpose of the}} present study was to explore the prognostic value of CD 4 þ and CD 8 þ tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (<b>TILs)</b> in glioma, and the prognostic value of infiltrating Forkhead box protein 3 (FoxP 3 þ) regulatory T cells were also investigated. Methods: CD 4 þ, FoxP 3 þ and CD 8 þ <b>TILs</b> were assessed by immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarray cores from 284 gliomas. Kaplan–Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the survival function of these <b>TILs</b> in 90 glioblastoma patients. Results: The number of CD 8 þ <b>TILs</b> was inversely correlated with tumour grade (P 0. 025), whereas the number of CD 4 þ <b>TILs</b> was positively correlated with tumour grade (P 0. 002). FoxP 3 þ <b>TILs</b> were only observed in glioblastomas, but not in low-grade astrocytomas or oligodendroglial tumours. Among patients with glioblastoma, none of CD 4 þ <b>TILs,</b> FoxP 3 þ <b>TILs</b> and CD 8 þ <b>TILs</b> alone was significantly associated with patient prognosis. However, the presence of high CD 4 þ and low CD 8 þ <b>TIL</b> levels was an independent predictor of poor progress-free survival (multivariate hazard ratio (HR) 1. 618, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 245 – 2. 101, Po 0. 001) and poor overall survival (multivariate HR 1. 508, 95 % CI 1. 162 – 1. 956, P 0. 002).

40|$|Tumor-infiltrating {{lymphocytes}} (<b>TILs)</b> are cells {{generated from}} tumor suspensions cultured in interleukin 2 that can mediate cancer regression when adoptively transferred into mice or humans.

To determine whether efficient gene transfer into <b>TILs</b> is feasible, we transduced human <b>TILs</b> with the bacterial gene for neomycin-resistance (NeoR) using the retroviral vector N 2. The transduced <b>TIL</b> populations were stable and polyclonal {{with respect to the}} intact NeoR gene integration and expressed high levels of neomycin phosphotransferase activity. The NeoR gene insertion did not alter the in vitro growth pattern and interleukin 2 dependence of the transduced <b>TILs.</b> Analyses of T-cell receptor gene rearrangement for beta- and gamma-chain genes revealed the oligoclonal nature of the <b>TIL</b> populations with no major change in the DNA rearrangement patterns or the levels of mRNA expression of the beta and gamma chains following transduction and selection of <b>TILs</b> in the neomycin analog G 418. Human <b>TILs</b> expressed mRNA for tumor necrosis factors (alpha and beta) and interleukin 2 receptor P 55 but not for interleukin 1 beta, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin 6, and interferon gamma when grown with high-dose interleukin 2 without subsequent activation with mitogen or specific antigen.
