30|$|A bifuzzy bi-matrix game {{problem has}} been {{formulated}} for two mobile network companies at West Bengal in India, depending upon their profits earned. It is considered that both the companies have four plans for rate of call charges. The plans are 1 paisa/s, 30 paisa/min, 50 paisa/ 2 min, and 3 rupees/ 10 min for their networks. Due to the availability of network and depending upon the plan, assuming that the people talk more in the first plan rather than the second plan. So, the profit occurs more in the first plan as compared to other plan. Suppose for the first company, the profit of the plan-a (1 paisa/s) is about 180 <b>to</b> 190 <b>million</b> per hour, but at night time, the profit arises up <b>to</b> 195 <b>million</b> and during morning it reduces <b>to</b> 175 <b>million.</b> For the plan-b (30 paisa/min), profit is about 156 <b>to</b> 158 <b>million</b> per hour, but at night time, the profit arises up <b>to</b> 160 <b>million</b> and during morning, it reduces <b>to</b> 150 <b>million.</b> For the plan-c (50 paisa/ 2 min), profit is about 90 <b>to</b> 95 <b>million</b> per hour, but at night time, the profit arises up <b>to</b> 100 <b>million</b> and during morning, it reduces <b>to</b> 80 <b>million.</b> For the plan-d (3 rupees/ 10 min), profit is about 120 <b>to</b> 130 <b>million</b> per hour, but at night time, the profit arises up <b>to</b> 140 <b>million</b> and during morning, it reduces <b>to</b> 100 <b>million.</b> Similarly, profit of the second company for plan-a (1 paisa/s) is about 165 <b>to</b> 170 <b>million</b> per hour, but at night time, the profit arises up <b>to</b> 175 <b>million</b> and during morning, it reduces <b>to</b> 160 <b>million.</b> For the plan-b (30 paisa/min), profit is about 145 <b>to</b> 148 <b>million</b> per hour, but at night time, the profit arises up <b>to</b> 150 <b>million</b> and during morning, it reduces <b>to</b> 140 <b>million.</b> For the plan-c (50 paisa/ 2 min), profit is about 75 <b>to</b> 78 <b>million</b> per hour, but at night time, the profit arises up <b>to</b> 82 <b>million</b> and during morning, it reduces <b>to</b> 70 <b>million.</b> For the plan-d (3 rupees/ 10 min), profit is about 100 <b>to</b> 110 <b>million</b> per hour but at night time, the profit arises up <b>to</b> 130 <b>million</b> and during morning, it reduces <b>to</b> 90 <b>million.</b> For this marketing strategy, the first company losses 2 million during at morning time and gains 2 million during at night time and other times gain varies between − 1 and 1 million per hour. Similarly, the second company losses 3 million during morning and gains 2 million during at night time and other times gain varies between − 2 and 1 million per hour.|$|R

5|$|In {{the history}} of popular music, there are a {{relative}} handful of performers who have redefined {{the content of the}} music at critical points in history—people whose music left the landscape, and definition of popular music, altered completely. The Kingston Trio were one such group, transforming folk music into a hot commodity and creating a demand—where none had existed before—for young men (sometimes with women) strumming acoustic guitars and banjos and singing folk songs and folk-like novelty songs in harmony. On a purely commercial level, from 1957 until 1963, the Kingston Trio were the most vital and popular folk group in the world, and folk music was sufficiently popular as to make that a significant statement. Equally important, the original trio—Dave Guard, Nick Reynolds, and Bob Shane—in tandem with other, similar early acts such as the Limeliters, spearheaded a boom in the popularity of folk music that suddenly made the latter important <b>to</b> <b>millions</b> of listeners who previously had ignored it.|$|E
