2500|$|At {{a meeting}} of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in 2011, Peace Corps volunteers shared their {{experiences}} of violence and sexual assault. At this meeting, it was found that between 2000–2009 there have been several cases of rape or attempted rape, and about 22 women [...] are sexually assaulted each year. The case of murdered Peace Corps volunteer Kate Puzey was discussed. The Peace Corps has gained attention in the media and their directors have been attacked for how they handled this situation. Kate Puzey's mother was one of those <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>comment</b> at the meeting about how badly the situation with her daughter had been handled. One woman claimed that her country's director had blamed her for getting raped, while other victims have also been similarly blamed. Criticism of how Peace Corps has responded to sexual assaults against volunteers culminated in the appointment of Kellie Green as the agency's first Director of the Office Of Victims Advocacy in 2011. Green was eventually pushed out of her position in April 2015 for purportedly [...] "creating a hostile work environment". Greene maintains that Peace Corps retaliated against her for pressing agency officials to fully comply with their responsibilities towards volunteers who have been victims of sexual assault. A Change.org petition demanding that Green be reinstated began circulating among former volunteers in December 2015.|$|E

And lastly, There is anger, {{which is}} another passion of the soul; and that, as the rest, is {{extended}} by the soul, according {{to the nature of}} the principle by which it is acted, and from whence it flows. And, in a word, to speak nothing of the fierceness and power of this passion, it is then cursed when it breaketh out beyond the bounds that God hath set it, the which to be sure it doth, when it shall by its fierceness or irregular motion, run the soul into sin. 'Be ye angry, and sin not' (Eph 4:26), is the limitation wherewith God hath bounded this passion; and whatever is more than this, is a giving place to the devil. And one reason, among others, why the Lord doth so strictly set this bound, and these limits to anger, is, for that it is so furious a passion, and for that it will so quickly swell up the soul with sin, as they say a toad swells with its poison. Yea, it will in a moment so transport the spirit of a man, that he shall quickly forget himself, his God, his friend, and all good rule. But my business is not now <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>comment</b> upon the passions of the soul, only to show you that there are such, and also which they are.|$|E

5000|$|Lester Gerard Packingham {{was caught}} using Facebook <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>comment</b> about a {{positive}} experience in traffic court, but argued that under the First Amendment {{he should be able}} to use websites for daily use in the dot-com era. A North Carolina Superior Court judge ruled that Packingham had violated North Carolina statute 14.208.5 by posting and uploading to Facebook and related sites. Packingham then appealed this ruling to the North Carolina Court of Appeals, which reversed unanimously, stating that the statute at issue infringed on his First Amendment rights. The North Carolina Supreme Court accepted the state's appeal and subsequently affirmed the conviction of the trial court, stating that Packingham was guilty; it reasoned that, as a registered sex offender, Packingham forfeited certain rights. Packingham appealed to the United States Supreme Court, claiming the court should use strict scrutiny when looking at First Amendment rights violations under this law. In a unanimous decision issued in June 2017, the court ruled the law unconstitutional, and that social media is considered a [...] "protected space" [...] under the First Amendment for lawful speech.|$|E
5000|$|The octave and sestet {{have special}} {{functions}} in a Petrarchan sonnet. The octave's {{purpose is to}} introduce a problem, express a desire, reflect on reality, or otherwise present a situation that causes doubt or a conflict within the speaker's soul and inside an animal and object in the story. It usually does this by introducing the problem within its first quatrain (unified four-line section) and developing it in the second. The beginning of the sestet {{is known as the}} volta, and it introduces a pronounced change in tone in the sonnet; the change in rhyme scheme marks the turn. The sestet's purpose as a whole is <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>comment</b> on the problem or to apply a solution to it. The pair are separate but usually used to reinforce a unified argument [...] - [...] they are often compared to two strands of thought organically converging into one argument, rather than a mechanical deduction. Moreover, Petrarch's own sonnets almost never had a rhyming couplet at the end as this would suggest logical deduction instead of the intended rational correlation of the form.|$|E

5000|$|Kumashiro's {{screenplay}} {{was based}} on Kafū Nagai's Yojohan Fusuma No Shitabari, one of several erotic novels the author circulated underground after having been censored {{by the government in}} 1907. Kumashiro uses his simple, but complexly told, story <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>comment</b> against censorship and militarism. One characteristic of Kumashiro's cinematic style which is present in The World of Geisha is the avoidance of sync sound through the use of titles. Titles can be used ironically in the film, as when the geisha house rules are presented, [...] "No.1: Don't fall for your first client", while Sodeko can be seen obviously breaking that rule. Cutaways are another technique Kumashiro uses prominently in The World of Geisha. Most reviews of the film comment on the opening love-making session which lasts over one-third of the film's total running time. This long scene is intercut with subplots involving the other geishas and their clients. Kumashiro's usage of inserts contrasts with that of traditional directors such as Ozu. Inserts in an Ozu film have a calming and transitional purpose, whereas Kumashiro uses them to shock the audience while also, in The World of Geisha, providing historical context. Historical events used as inserts in The World of Geisha include the Korean uprisings, Russia's October Revolution, the Japanese Rice Riots of 1918, and a police order censoring the news of these riots.|$|E

Images from the war captured in the song include reading Playboy, seeing Bob Hope, listening to The Doors, smoking from a hash pipe, praying to Jesus, remembering [...] "Charlie" [...] and [...] "Baker", the Company identifiers used in military units, and those in those Companies who [...] "left their childhood / on every acre", many of whom died in the fighting.
