5|$|Compositional mapping and Io's {{high density}} suggest that Io {{contains}} {{little to no}} water, though small pockets of water ice or hydrated minerals have been tentatively identified, most notably on the northwest flank of the mountain Gish Bar Mons. Io has <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> water of any known body in the Solar System. This lack of water is likely due to Jupiter being hot enough early {{in the evolution of}} the Solar System to drive off volatile materials like water in the vicinity of Io, but not hot enough to do so farther out.|$|E
5|$|Like the sassabies, {{hartebeest}} produce quiet quacking and grunting sounds. Juveniles {{tend to be}} {{more vocal}} than adults, and produce a quacking call when alarmed or pursued. The hartebeest uses defecation as an olfactory and visual display. Herds are generally sedentary, and tend to migrate only under adverse conditions such as natural calamities. The hartebeest is the least migratory in the tribe Alcelaphini (which also includes wildebeest and sassabies), and also consumes <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> water and has the lowest metabolic rate among the members of the tribe.|$|E

5|$|Oppenheimer, {{reviewing}} {{his options}} in early 1943, gave {{priority to the}} gun-type weapon, but as a hedge against the threat of pre-detonation, he created the E-5 Group at the Los Alamos Laboratory under Seth Neddermeyer to investigate implosion. Implosion-type bombs were determined to be significantly more efficient in terms of explosive yield per unit mass of fissile material in the bomb, because compressed fissile materials react more rapidly and therefore more completely. It was decided that the plutonium gun would receive {{the bulk of the}} research effort, since it was the project with <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty involved. It was assumed that the uranium gun-type bomb could be more easily adapted from it.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, a {{new report}} was released stating that the Route 30 Connector project was feasible. The proposed Connector was to be one mile (1.3km) long, and would be constructed as an elevated highway above the wetlands. Construction cost was estimated at $80 million, half {{of which could be}} paid for by making the Connector a toll road. The new report also identified US 30 as an important roadway for reducing city traffic, as it carried <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> traffic and had the greatest capacity out of the city's three major entering highways, the other two being the Expressway and the Black Horse Pike (US 40/US 322).|$|E

5|$|Green tea: This tea has {{undergone}} <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> oxidation. The oxidation process is halted by the quick application of heat after tea picking, either with steam, the method preferred in Japan, or by dry roasting and cooking in hot pans, preferred in Chinese tea processing. Tea leaves may {{be left to}} dry as separate leaves {{or they may be}} rolled into small pellets to make gunpowder tea. This process is time consuming and is typically done with pekoes of higher quality. The tea is processed within one to two days of harvesting, and if done correctly retains most of the chemical composition of the fresh leaves from which it was produced. Variation in steaming time for fixation or processing from additional stages of rolling and drying are sometimes used to improve or altering the flavour for types of green tea. Green tea leaves undergo fixation by either roasting (panning) or steaming. Generally, roasted varieties are richer in flavor, while steamed varieties are more vivid in color.|$|E

5|$|The player {{controls}} paddles {{along the}} screen's edges to knock a bouncing ball, Kirby, into destructible bricks. The player loses a life if Kirby hits {{the edge of}} the screen. Each of the game's eleven stages include five rounds of increasingly complex block patterns for Kirby to clear. The ten different block types vary in durability and points value. A well-timed hit of the paddle gives Kirby a powerful bounce to break through harder blocks. Another block type turns the remaining blocks into a bonus round that rewards the player for clearing the screen in <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> time. The player can find warp stars that lead to minigames, such as air hockey, where the player can earn extra lives. The rounds also include enemies to attack and avoid. Some enemies contain bonus items. Each stage ends in a boss fight.|$|E

3000|$|With {{both the}} {{magnetic}} field and the flow converging at high latitudes, {{it is difficult to}} distinguish which physical parameter predominates: {{the magnetic field}} or the flow? Ulrich and Boyden suggested that the converging flow at high latitudes predominates. Perhaps, another question is more important to answer: what are the relative roles of the flow vs. the polar field? One cannot answer this intriguing question positively without further observations of the Sun’s polar regions, which might help us understand the solar dynamo. Perhaps because the poles have, presumably <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> solar activity, these high latitude regions may be called the “ignoro-latitudes.” It may be, however, that although not magnetically [...] "active," [...] they are the most important regions of the Sun to study if we wish to understand the interplay between poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields, since only the latter are well observed from Earth.|$|R

We classify certain graphs that cannot be labeled to become diversity graphs and provide two equivalent notions of diversity graphs. Moreover, we show how {{to solve the problem}} in special situations and describe a possible algorithm for solving it completely...|$|R
