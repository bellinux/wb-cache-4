As the attacks continue, La Forge recalls Logan <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> and orders a saucer separation, leaving Logan in charge of the saucer, and taking command of the star-drive section from the battle bridge himself to return to Minos.|$|E

5|$|More recently, the Verrazano–Narrows Bridge, {{built from}} 1959 to 1964, had been {{proposed}} {{to serve as}} the rail link. The 95th Street station was slated to be connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> one of the world's longest suspension bridges, because it followed the route of the planned tunnel. However, no space for any tracks was ever built because of Moses's opposition to the expansion of New York City public transportation.|$|E
5|$|On 8 December 1864, {{the bridge}} was lit by {{magnesium}} flares for its ceremonial opening parade, but they were blown out by the wind.

50|$|Queen Maud/Matilda (c.1080-1 May 1118), wife of King Henry I, {{financed the}} {{construction}} of two stone bridges and a causeway over {{the branches of the}} River Lea in Stratford-by-Bow. As Barking Abbey was <b>the</b> closest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridges,</b> <b>the</b> Queen gave the abbey the responsibility for maintaining <b>the</b> <b>bridges,</b> and donated lands as an endowment to finance those future repairs. After the foundation of Stratford Langthorne Abbey in 1135 (which was closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridges),</b> <b>the</b> Abbess of Barking transferred <b>the</b> responsibility <b>to</b> Stratford. This started a dispute between the two abbeys which was not settled until 1315. A settlement was reached when the Abbess of Barking paid the Abbot of Stratford Lanthorne £200; in return, <b>the</b> abbot agreed <b>to</b> maintain <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> and causeway, and to pay an annual rent of four marks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> abbess.|$|R

5|$|Population and {{commercial}} activity grew rapidly after India gained independence in August 1947. The only link across the Hooghly River, the Howrah Bridge, between Howrah and Kolkata, {{was subject to}} much traffic congestion, with over 85,000 vehicles every day. This necessitated planning for a new bridge across the river {{so that it could}} connect to the major cities of Mumbai (Bombay), Delhi and Chennai (Madras) through the national highways located close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge is}} now part of the Route {{nationale}} 10 which runs between Hendaye and Paris. Both viaducts <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> date from 1839 and each measures approximately 250m. Over time, large settlements occurred, causing serious disturbances in the masonry and requiring the replacement of many vaults in 1880, 1903 and 1934.|$|E
5|$|The first {{evidence}} {{that something was}} wrong at Vrbanja Bridge was radio silence from the French post. About 05:20 on 27 May, platoon commander Captain François Lecointre had lost radio contact with the posts, and drove <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> {{to find out what was}} happening; he was met by a Serb sentry in French uniform who attempted to take him prisoner. Lecointre quickly turned around and drove to Skenderija stadium, the headquarters of FREBAT4.|$|E

5|$|Unusually for a Thames bridge, {{only three}} of Chiswick Bridge's five spans cross the river; the shorter spans {{at each end of}} the bridge cross the former towpaths.

5|$|All nine gliders {{carrying}} the troops assigned to Group Steel landed next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> at Veldwezelt at 05:20, the barbed-wire {{wrapped around the}} landing skids of the gliders succeeding in rapidly bringing them to a halt. The glider belonging to Leutnant Altmann had landed {{some distance from the}} bridge, and a second had landed directly in front of a Belgian pillbox, which began engaging both groups of airborne troops with small-arms fire. The non-commissioned officer in charge of the troops from the second glider hurled grenades at the pillbox whilst one of his men laid an explosive charge at the door and detonated it, allowing the bunker to be assaulted and removed as an obstacle. Simultaneously, Altmann gathered his troops and led them along a ditch running parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> until two men were able to reach the canal bank and climb onto the girders of the bridge and disconnect the demolition charges placed there by the Belgian garrison. Thus the airborne troops prevented the Belgians from destroying the bridge, though they still faced the rest of the Belgian defenders. The defenders held on until a platoon of German reinforcements arrived and forced them to retire to a nearby village. However, the assaulting force's small-arms fire could not overcome two field-guns located five hundred metres from the bridge, thus forcing Altmann to call for air support. Several Junkers Ju 87 Stukas responded and knocked out the guns. Group Steel was to be relieved by 14:30, but Belgian resistance delayed their arrival in strength until 21:30. During the fighting, the attacking force left eight airborne troops dead and thirty wounded.|$|E
5|$|Among the company's {{other goals}} {{was that of}} helping finance road {{projects}} on Øygarden. The most pressing issue was the section from Kolltveit on Store Sotra <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> part of National Road 555. In 1976, the company issued NOK5 million in an interest-free loan to the project, which was repaid in 1982 and 1983. Similar conditions were imposed for NOK2 million for National Road 561 to Nordra Straumsundet and NOK1.2 million {{for the establishment of}} the Solsvik–Rong Ferry in 1974. The rest of the subsidies were given as grants. The main project was National Road 561, which ran from Kollveit northwards through Øygarden, for which the company paid NOK28.6 million. It paid a further NOK9.3 million for other projects in Sotra and Øygarden, including connections to Turøy and Misje.|$|E

5|$|At its west end, US 50 was {{extended}} south from Sacramento along U.S. Route 99 to Stockton and {{west to the}} San Francisco Bay Area, replacing U.S. Route 48, by the early 1930s. US 50 was officially cut back to Sacramento in the 1964 renumbering, replaced by Interstate 580, but remained on maps and signs for several more years. US 50 {{was extended}} east from Annapolis to Ocean City, Maryland in 1949, three {{years prior to the}} opening of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in 1952; this extension replaced Maryland Route 404 between Annapolis and Wye Mills and U.S. Route 213 between Wye Mills and Ocean City. Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> opening, US 50 used a ferry across the Chesapeake Bay between Sandy Point and Matapeake and followed present-day Maryland Route 8 between Matapeake and Stevensville before continuing east.|$|E
