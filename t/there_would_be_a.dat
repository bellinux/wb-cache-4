5|$|At {{the same}} time, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{continuing}} need for fast freight locomotives, capable of operating on both electrified and non-electrified routes, without impeding the intensive {{use of the}} system by passenger trains. Suburban electrification used electric multiple units, which had no equivalent freight design. Although Bulleid built two prototype electric locomotives in 1941, these were, as yet, unproven, and freight haulage would be undertaken by steam traction for the foreseeable future.|$|E

Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, {{released}} a statement and said <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> day of national remembrance for the war dead of France. Ponticelli was survived by at least one child, his then-78-year-old daughter, Janine Desbaucheron.|$|E
5|$|Since postseason games cannot {{end in a}} tie, {{unlike the}} preseason or regular season, {{additional}} overtime periods are played as necessary until a winner is determined. Furthermore, all clock rules apply as if a game had started over. Therefore, if the first overtime period ends with the score still tied, the teams switch ends of the field prior to double overtime. If a game was still tied with two minutes to go in double overtime, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> two-minute warning (but not during the first overtime period as in the regular season). And if it were still tied {{at the end of}} double overtime, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> kickoff to start triple overtime. Although a contest could theoretically last indefinitely, or last multiple overtime periods like several National Hockey League postseason games, no NFL playoff game has ever gone into triple-overtime. The longest NFL game played to date is 82 minutes, 40 seconds: Miami Dolphins kicker Garo Yepremian made the winning 37-yard field goal after 7:40 of double-overtime to defeat the Kansas City Chiefs, 27–24, in the 1971–72 NFL playoffs on December 25, 1971.|$|E

5|$|A four-track Second Avenue Subway would {{originate}} from {{a connection to}} the IRT Pelham Line at 138th Street, the Bronx, to Grand Street, Manhattan. The connection to the Pelham Line would allow for eight additional trains per hour operating between Manhattan and the Pelham Line. It would then be possible to operate 10-car trains via the line and it would also be possible to operate full express service via the line's center express track. The trains operating via Nassau Street would go to Brooklyn via the Montague Tunnel. During non-rush hours trains would terminate at Broad Street. <b>There</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> passageway built from Grand Central via 43rd Street to Second Avenue to permit transfers.|$|E

5|$|Adverse weather {{such as a}} storm or hail could devastate crop {{fields and}} orchards, and thus {{jeopardize}} the livelihood of farmers in the affected area. A role of zduhaći, according to folk tradition, was to lead storms and hail clouds away from their family estates, villages, or regions, to save their crops. A zduhać could take the storms and hail clouds over the territory of another zduhać to destroy its crops. The other zduhać would fly up to confront the bringer of bad weather, and <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> fight between the zduhaći.|$|E
5|$|After Rollins {{suffered}} a legitimate severe knee injury at a live event, the WWE World Heavyweight Championship was vacated {{and it was}} announced that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> tournament to determine a new champion at Survivor Series. On the November 9 episode of Raw, Triple H offered to give Reigns a bye to the finals of the tournament if he joined The Authority, but Reigns refused. At Survivor Series, Reigns defeated Dean Ambrose in the tournament finals to become WWE World Heavyweight Champion. Triple H came out and attempted to congratulate Reigns, but was instead hit with a spear. This allowed Sheamus to cash in his Money in the Bank contract and quickly defeat Reigns to win the championship, resulting in Sheamus aligning with The Authority.|$|E
5|$|All six main {{cast members}} from the pilot {{returned}} for the series; James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale play Adam Williams and Rachel Bradley, a couple in a fledgling relationship; John Thomson and Fay Ripley play Pete and Jenny Gifford, a married couple whose first child is born in the first episode; Robert Bathurst and Hermione Norris play David and Karen Marsden, an upper-middle-class couple who are considering having a second child. Each had mixed feelings about whether <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> series commission after the poor reception of the pilot; Ripley did not stop thinking about it, in contrast to Bathurst, who viewed it as just another failed pilot he had done.|$|E

5|$|Although {{satellite}} {{males are}} on average slightly smaller and lighter than residents, the nutrition of the chicks does not, as previously thought, influence mating strategy; rather, the inherited mating strategy influences body size. Resident-type chicks will, if {{provided with the}} same amount of food, grow heavier than satellite-type chicks. Satellite males do not have to expend energy to defend a territory, and can spend more time foraging, so they {{do not need to be}} as bulky as the residents; indeed, since they fly more, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> physiological cost to additional weight.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in Iaşi (Jassy) in 1876, Goldfaden was {{fortunate}} to be better known as a good poet — many of whose poems had been set to music and had become popular songs — than as a less-than-successful businessman. Nevertheless, when he sought funds from Isaac Librescu for another newspaper, Librescu was uninterested in that proposition. Librescu's wife remarked that Yiddish-language journalism was {{just a way to}} starve; she suggested that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> lot more of a market for Yiddish-language theater.
