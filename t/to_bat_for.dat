5|$|Brian Lara is {{a former}} cricketer and captain of the West Indies cricket team. He was a skilled batsman, and {{was known for his}} ability <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> <b>for</b> long and high-scoring innings. From his debut in {{international}} cricket in 1990 to his retirement in 2007, Lara scored 11,953 runs in Tests and 10,405 in One Day Internationals (ODI), accumulating a total of 53 centuries. His accomplishments with the bat saw him chosen as the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year in 1994, as well as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1995.|$|E
5|$|The tour {{ended with}} two non-first-class matches against Scotland. In the first, Australia scored 236 before Johnston took 6/15 from 12.5 overs. He took {{the last four}} wickets as the home team fell from 6/81 to be all out for 85. Johnston bowled four wicketless overs in the second innings as Australia {{completed}} victory without needing <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> <b>for</b> a second time. In the second match, he signed off on his tour in a low key manner, taking a wicket in each innings to end with a match total of 2/48 as Australia completed another innings triumph.|$|E
5|$|Things were {{different}} in the county matches. As Bradman wanted to keep Lindwall and Miller fresh for the Tests, he generally gave them a lighter workload against the weaker opposition in the county matches, and the three spinners Ring, Johnson and McCool did more of the work, especially as the 55-over rule did not apply outside the Tests. Ring did the second-most bowling outside the Tests, despite not being in Bradman's first-choice team. Bradman even used Hamence, a reserve batsman, to open the bowling at times, in order to rest his bowlers, {{and in the second}} match against Yorkshire, decided <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> <b>for</b> an extended period instead of going for a win, so that his bowlers could recuperate.|$|E
40|$|An {{oil spill}} is the {{accidental}} or intentional release of petroleum products {{into the environment}} {{as a result of}} human activity (drilling, manufacturing, storing, transporting, waste management). Oil spills are unfortunately common events {{in many parts of the}} world. A survey has been undertaken on Best Available Techniques (<b>BATs)</b> used both <b>for</b> oil spill prevention and oil spill response. Preventing oil spill is definitely the best strategy for avoiding potential damage to human health and the environment. Nevertheless, when a spill occurs, the best approach for containing and controlling the spill is to take action quickly and in a well-organized and efficient way. The aim of the paper is the proposal of evaluation criteria aiming at an optimal BAT determination when an oil spill occurs. The criteria are referred <b>to</b> <b>BATs</b> <b>for</b> oil spill containment and <b>to</b> <b>BATs</b> <b>for</b> clean up of marine habitat, with particular regard to the item of the preservation of biodiversity...|$|R
25|$|While {{attempting}} <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> time <b>for</b> a draw on {{the fifth}} day, the ninth and tenth-wicket partnerships featuring Steve O'Keefe, Peter Nevill and Josh Hazlewood (Aus) faced a Test cricket record 25.4 consecutive overs without scoring a run.|$|R

5|$|In reply, Australia {{was still}} some way behind when Lindwall {{came in at}} 6/329 on the third afternoon. With the fall of Sam Loxton and Saggers in quick succession, Bradman’s men were at 8/355 with only Johnston and Toshack remaining. Lindwall hit out, scoring 77 in an innings marked by {{powerful}} driving and pulling; he dominated in stands of 48 and 55 with Johnston and Toshack respectively. He particularly liked to use his feet {{to get to the}} ball on the half-volley to hit lofted drives. Of the 103 runs added for the last two wickets, the two tail-enders managed only 25 between them. Johnston accompanied Lindwall for 80 minutes, before the injured Toshack survived the last 50 minutes until stumps with Johnston running for him. Australia were 9/457 at stumps, with Lindwall on 76 and Toshack on 12. During Lindwall’s partnership with Johnston, Yardley bowled himself for over an hour, failing to bring on a frontline bowler in his stead despite being unable to dislodge the batsmen. Lindwall farmed the strike by trying to hit boundaries and twos during the over, but Yardley did not resort to the tactic of setting a deep field to yield a single to Lindwall to get the tailenders on strike. Despite Toshack and Johnston’s lack of familiarity with having and acting as a runner respectively, and the resulting disorders in running between the wickets, Lindwall was able to manipulate the strike and face most of the balls. O’Reilly speculated that Yardley may have bowled himself in an attempt to contain the Australians rather than dismiss them before the close of play, so his openers would not have <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> <b>for</b> a short period before stumps when the visitors' attack could have made inroads. However, Yardley was neither able to contain Lindwall nor dismiss the Australians. Sunday was a rest day, and on Monday, the fourth morning, Lindwall was the last man out in the third over of the day, leaving Australia on 458, 38 runs in arrears on the first innings. Lindwall edged Bedser into the slips cordon and Crapp took the catch low down in his left hand.|$|E

25|$|India batted {{for almost}} two days to set {{themselves}} up in a dominant position. However the Australians were able <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> <b>for</b> another two days and save the test. The Indians declared late {{on the final day}} to give the retiring Anil Kumble a few final overs.|$|E
25|$|One of Selleck's Magnum co-stars, Larry Manetti, in his 1996 memoir Aloha Magnum, was lavish in his {{praise of}} Selleck. Manetti lauded Selleck for his {{extraordinary}} work ethic on a grueling show (shooting {{for hours in}} the midday Hawaiian sun), Selleck's work with Hawaiian charities, and his willingness to go <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> <b>for</b> the program's cast and crew members.|$|E

The uncle is appalled by Dora's line of work and consents with one stipulation, that she {{never set foot in}} Kansas City again.|$|R
25|$|England {{resumed their}} innings under immense pressure, needing a further 538 runs to win with 9 wickets in hand or needing <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> <b>for</b> 2 days {{to draw the}} game and keep the series alive. With the pitch looking good for batting and no real {{movement}} off the seam this seemed possible with some sensible batting.|$|E
25|$|During the semi-final of the 2010/11 Regional Four Day Competition, Nash scored his highest {{first-class}} score. The {{innings of}} 207runs came from 349balls, and bettered his previous best of 176runs. Though the semi-final against Trinidad and Tobago {{ended in a}} draw, Jamaica faced Combined Campuses and Colleges in the final. Nash was unable <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> <b>for</b> Jamaica due to injury, but the side {{went on to win}} the match by eight wickets.|$|E
25|$|For example, if Team 1 batted for 20 overs before rain came, {{thinking}} {{they would have}} 50 overs in total, but at the re-start there was only time for Team 2 <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> <b>for</b> 20 overs, it would clearly be unfair to give Team 2 the target that Team 1 achieved, as Team 1 would have batted less conservatively and scored more runs, if they had known they would only have the 20 overs.|$|E
5000|$|Game 3 of the 1918 World Series {{came to an}} {{end with}} Pick being caught in a rundown between third base and home plate, failing to score on a passed ball, in a 2-1 Chicago loss to the Boston Red Sox. Pick went on <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> [...]389 <b>for</b> the Series, leading the Cubs in hits.|$|R
50|$|After {{continuing}} <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> well <b>for</b> Denver in 1992, Nilsson {{was called}} up to the Brewers and batted in the 9 hole while playing catcher. Despite striking out in his first at bat, he redeemed himself later that game with a three-run double. Nilsson {{was one of the}} 10 youngest players in the 1992 American League in his first season.|$|R
50|$|Craven scored {{eight in}} his first innings, batting {{at the end of}} the batting order, before moving up <b>to</b> open the <b>batting</b> <b>for</b> the second innings where he failed to score. His team, however, were victorious by 92 runs.|$|R
25|$|As {{a result}} of a rib injury {{obtained}} {{during the course of the}} Test (and determined to be an internal injury rather than an external one) the Pakistan Captain, Inzamam-ul-Haq, was unable <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> <b>for</b> 4h20m in the Pakistan 2nd innings, or until the fall of the 5th wicket (whichever came first). As England took five wickets in the first session of the last day, he was able to come in at number 7 in the order. His wicket was eventually the last to fall, being stumped off the bowling of Monty Panesar, and Pakistan were all out for 155.|$|E
25|$|On the West Indies tour of Australia in 2005, Bravo was {{controversially}} not {{picked for}} the first Test at Brisbane in which the West Indies were beaten convincingly. He was recalled for the second Test in Hobart and made a superb 113, after coming in at a very difficult stage for the West Indies. His innings lifted the West Indies and helped them regain some pride, forcing the Australians <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> <b>for</b> a second time in the match. In {{the third and final}} match of the series at Adelaide, he bowled a superb spell in the Australians first innings taking 6 for 84.|$|E
25|$|Centuries by Barrington (his first Test hundred) and Dexter {{ensured that}} England {{made a big}} score. Alexander took five catches. In response, West Indies were 102/3, but then a mammoth fourth wicket {{partnership}} of 399 (still the record for that wicket for West Indies against all countries) by Sobers and Worrell took them into a first innings lead. In the circumstances, Trueman's analysis was a good one. West Indies had scored at under {{two and a half}} runs per over, and by the time that they declared England only had <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> <b>for</b> 140 minutes in their second innings. Allen for England, and Scarlett and Watson for West Indies, made their Test debuts. Statham was unfit, Moss playing in his stead.|$|E

60|$|Brill came <b>to</b> the <b>bat</b> <b>for</b> {{the third}} time {{with a sort of}} do-or-die look on the faces of the players. It was plucky little Spud who started a batting streak, getting safely to first and {{followed}} by another player who managed to reach second, landing Spud on third. Then came two outs. Before the inning was ended, however, two runs were placed on the board to the credit of Brill.|$|R
5000|$|All these {{impressive}} {{statistics were}} just a prelude to , when Brett won the American League MVP and batted [...]390, a modern record for a third baseman. Brett's batting average was at or above [...]400 as {{late in the season}} as September 19, and the country closely followed his quest <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> [...]400 <b>for</b> an entire season, a feat which has not been accomplished since Ted Williams in [...]|$|R
25|$|Boyce's fielding {{would play}} a {{similarly}} instrumental role for the Foxes in {{the final of the}} following year's Twenty20 competition on 27 August 2011, again at Edgbaston. Boyce had played in the Super Over victory over the Lancashire Lightning in the day's earlier semi-final, although he was not needed <b>to</b> <b>bat.</b> <b>For</b> the evening's final against Somerset, he was replaced in the Foxes' team by Jigar Naik. However, once again Jefferson had batted but was not able to take to the field, again due to an Achilles problem. This meant that Boyce would again appear as a substitute for Jefferson at Edgbaston. Boyce took the catches of James Hildreth, Peter Trego, Jos Buttler and Alfonso Thomas, all off the bowling of man of the match Josh Cobb, thus helping to steer the Foxes to a win by 18 runs and clinch the trophy.|$|E
25|$|An Australian {{collapse}} {{after lunch}} {{on the fourth day}} meant England were actually leading by six runs after the first innings. With Australia needing to dismiss England and score more runs than them, England merely had <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> <b>for</b> as long as possible, denying Australia the time needed to force victory. Thanks to Kevin Pietersen's maiden Test century on the fifth day, and Paul Collingwood batting patiently for 10 runs in 51 minutes in the second innings, Australia were left with a target of 342 runs with only 19 overs remaining in the day. With Steve Harmison opening the bowling for England, Australia were offered the light in the first over of their second innings and accepted, leaving Rudi Koertzen and Billy Bowden to remove the bails at 18:17 BST to signal a drawn match and the series victory for England.|$|E
25|$|Close was {{recalled}} to the England Test squad in 1963, {{and played}} {{his first full}} series of five matches, against the West Indies. His innings in the second Test at Lord's remains his best known. When England were pressing for a last-day victory, Close took the battle to the fastest West Indian fast bowlers, Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith, daring to advance down the wicket to them. This was before body protection and helmets were in use, and time and again the ball struck Close firmly on his body. But he persevered. With no other England player but Ken Barrington scoring above 20, Close's innings of 70 saved the game for England, and came near to winning it. Set 234 to win, England ended on 228 for 9, with Colin Cowdrey famously coming in <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> (<b>for</b> two balls at the non-striker's end) with his broken arm in plaster.|$|E
50|$|Before the 1910 Major League Baseball season, Hugh Chalmers of the Chalmers Automobile Company {{announced}} a promotion {{in which a}} Chalmers Model 30 automobile would be given <b>to</b> the <b>batting</b> champions <b>for</b> Major League Baseball's American and National Leagues.|$|R

25|$|Brown {{played only}} three more Tests, all against the Australians – two in 1896 {{and one in}} 1899 – {{although}} many judges (not least Wisden) {{felt that he was}} unlucky not to be selected for the 1897/98 Ashes tour. He continued <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> productively <b>for</b> Yorkshire for several more seasons, but in 1904 he played just two matches, both in May, against Cambridge University and Leicestershire before a heart condition forced his retirement.|$|R
