5|$|In {{the early}} years, he was {{assisted}} by <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> become his trusted prime-minister, Johan Göransson Gyllenstierna (1635–1680). Some {{sources say the}} king was basically dependent on Gyllenstierna,. His sudden death in 1680 opened up {{the road to the}} monarch, and many men tried to get close to the king to take Gyllenstierna's place.|$|E
60|$|But {{while such}} men exist, how shall a man escape them? How shall he defend himself from them? Not by craft and falsehood, not by angry replies, not by {{fighting}} {{them with their}} own weapons. <b>The</b> honest <b>man</b> is no match for them with those. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> a conscience is no match for <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> none. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> no conscience does what he wills; everything is fair to him in war; and there--in his unscrupulousness--lies his evil strength. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> a conscience dares not do what he likes. His scruples--in plain words, his fear of God--hamper him, and put him at a disadvantage, which will always defeat him, {{as often as he}} borrows the devil's tools to do God's work withal.|$|R

6000|$|There they were, half-phantom {{through the}} fog, a silent, foot-dragging, interminable, grey procession. They carried wet, dirty banners, they rattled boxes for pence; these <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not said [...] "snap" [...] {{in the right}} place, <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> [...] "snapped" [...] too eagerly, <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> never said [...] "snap," [...] <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> {{never had a chance}} of saying [...] "snap." [...] A shambling, shameful stream they made, oozing along the street, the gutter waste of {{competitive}} civilisation. And we stood high out of it all, as high as if we looked godlike from another world, standing in a room beautifully lit and furnished, skillfully warmed, filled with costly things.|$|R

However, Crispin appears and attacks <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> argued with Baby. The man, joined by Jimson Augustine, jumps on Crispin in retaliation. Noticing the commotion, Mahesh tries to calm everyone down but Jimson, furious at Mahesh's authoritative stance, beats him up. Vincent breaks up the fight. Embarrassed, Mahesh vows to get back at Jimson and pledges that he will wear slippers only after he has avenged his humiliation.|$|E
5|$|Dworkin {{later wrote}} that she {{eventually}} {{agreed to help}} smuggle a briefcase of heroin through customs in return for $1,000 and an airplane ticket, thinking that if she was successful she could return home with the ticket and the money, and if caught she would at least escape her ex-husband's abuse by going to prison. The deal for the briefcase fell through, but <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> promised Dworkin the money gave her the airline ticket anyway, and {{she returned to the}} United States in 1972.|$|E
5|$|Several days later, {{the court}} finds Jamila {{guilty of murder}} and {{sentences}} her to death, a sentence which {{will be carried out}} in 36 hours. Ria visits Jamila in her cell to check on her, and Ria explains that she intends to ask the president for a stay.

5|$|The Albert Dock {{was officially}} re-opened in 1988 by The Prince of Wales, the great-great-great-grandson of Prince Albert, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> {{originally}} opened the docks. It was timed {{to coincide with}} the opening of the newly finished Tate Liverpool, which was dubbed the 'Tate of the north' and at the time the only one outside London. The decision to locate a Tate gallery in Liverpool was seen as a major success for the city, as it made Liverpool home to the National Collection of modern art in the North of England.|$|E
5|$|The first Guardian {{video was}} shot on {{a digital camera}} by an {{investment}} fund manager from New York who was in London on business, and who attended the protests out of curiosity. On his way to Heathrow airport, {{he realized that the}} man he had filmed being assaulted was <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> reportedly died of a heart attack. At that point, 2 am on 7 April, he passed his footage to The Guardian, which published it on its website that afternoon. The newspaper passed a copy to the IPCC, which opened a criminal inquiry.|$|E
5|$|A {{plot against}} {{his life was}} revealed, {{and one of his}} officers, Philotas, was {{executed}} for failing to alert Alexander. The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus Parmenion, who had been charged with guarding the treasury at Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgmental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle.|$|E

5|$|Aristotle related {{that the}} revolt of Mytilene against Athens in 428BCE {{originated}} {{in a dispute}} over epikleroi. The Sacred War of 356–346 BCE, between Thebes and Phocis, was also started by a disagreement over epikleroi. It is likely that Agariste, the daughter of Cleisthenes of Sicyon who married Megacles of Athens, was an epikleros. Likewise, the widow of the Spartan king Agis IV, Agiatis, was forced to marry Cleomenes, the son of <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> executed Agis, King Leonidas II. Plutarch stated that the reason Leonidas married Agiatis to Kleomenes was that Agiatis was a patrouchos from her father, Gylippos. Another Spartan example may have been Gorgo, the only daughter of King Cleomenes I, who was married to Cleomenes' brother Leonidas I.|$|E
5|$|As part of William III and Mary II's {{coronation}} honours, Churchill {{was created}} Earl of Marlborough on 9 April 1689 (O.S.); {{he was also}} sworn {{as a member of}} the Privy Council and made a Gentleman of the King's Bedchamber. His elevation, however, led to accusatory rumours from King James's supporters that Marlborough had disgracefully betrayed his erstwhile king for personal gain; William himself entertained reservations about <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> deserted James. Marlborough's apologists though, including his most notable descendant and biographer Winston Churchill, have been at pains to attribute patriotic, religious, and moral motives to his action; but in the words of Chandler, it is difficult to absolve Marlborough of ruthlessness, ingratitude, intrigue and treachery against a man to whom he owed virtually everything in his life and career to date.|$|E
5|$|Black {{and several}} former colleagues of his from the Federal Bureau of Investigation decide to taunt the killer into coming forward, giving {{a press release}} {{describing}} him as cowardly. A furious Dion calls the police to rebut this, betraying his identity. Police arrive at his home to arrest him, finding him sitting, covered in blood, {{on the kitchen floor}} beside his mother's body. He is apprehended, clearing Malcom Hunziger of wrongdoing. Black and his family return home to Seattle. Black carries his daughter from the airport to their car, while Catherine waits to collect their luggage. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> helped Dion stands to one side, watching the family. As Black returns to help Catherine with the suitcases, she has disappeared, leaving behind only an origami dove given to her by her mother.|$|E

5|$|In 1907, Barnette {{was accused}} of embezzling money from the Fairbanks bank he operated, and he was sued by <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> funded the venture {{that led to the}} {{founding}} of Fairbanks. During the lawsuit, it was revealed that Barnette had been convicted of larceny in Oregon. As his legal bills added up, Barnette decided to lease the Fairbanks Daily News to a group of local businessmen. On June 15, 1908, Barnette ended the lease agreement by selling the newspaper to J. Harmon Caskey and Henry Roden. That same year, the campaign to elect Alaska's first delegate to Congress was under way, and one of the candidates, Jack Corson, purchased one-third of the newspaper. Corson's campaign manager promptly was named the editor of the Daily News, and the paper switched to actively supporting Corson's candidacy.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, at a {{performance}} of The Diary of Anne Frank in Vienna, Simon Wiesenthal was challenged {{by a group of}} protesters who asserted that Anne Frank had never existed, and who challenged Wiesenthal to prove her existence by finding <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> arrested her. Wiesenthal indeed began searching for Karl Silberbauer and found him in 1963. When interviewed, Silberbauer admitted his role, and identified Anne Frank from a photograph as one of the people arrested. Silberbauer provided a full account of events, even recalling emptying a briefcase full of papers onto the floor. His statement corroborated the version of events that had previously been presented by witnesses such as Otto Frank.|$|E
5|$|In December 1943, the Alsos Mission reached Algiers, where Pash {{reported}} to the Chief of Staff at Allied Force Headquarters (AFHQ), Major General Walter B. Smith, and his British Chief of Intelligence, Brigadier Kenneth Strong. This was awkward as Pash's instructions were not to give the British information about the Alsos Mission, {{but it turned out}} that Strong was already fully aware of it. It was arranged that Pash would deal with Strong's American deputy, Colonel Thomas E. Roderick. The Alsos Mission then moved on to Italy, where it was assigned to Major General Kenyon A. Joyce's Allied Control Commission. Pash met with Marshal of Italy Pietro Badoglio, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> negotiated Italy's surrender to the Allies, and was now head of the Italian Provisional Military Government, who gave him a letter of introduction addressed to Italian civil and military authorities.|$|E

5|$|In early 1914, Baker {{graduated}} from Princeton, majoring in history, politics, and economics, {{and finished with}} above-average grades. He was named the school's best football player, hockey player, and all-round athlete and <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> done the most for Princeton. The football team had posted a record of twenty wins, three losses, and four ties in Baker's three seasons as a member; the hockey team fared equally well {{with a record of}} twenty wins and seven losses. By the end of his football career at Princeton, he had two notable achievements: he had never fumbled a punt, and had never lost to Yale.|$|E
5|$|His {{children}} were Thomas, Barbara, Peter, Patricia, and Stephen. Thomas graduated from West Point {{in the class}} of 1942, received the Silver Star Medal and the Distinguished Service Cross, and reached the rank of captain before being killed at Anzio on 25 February 1944. An Army port repair ship, the Thomas F. Farrell Jr., was named in his honor. Peter graduated from West Point {{in the class of}} 1950. He served with the Army in the Vietnam War, where he commanded the 6th Battalion, 56th Air Defense Artillery during the Tet Offensive. He retired from the Army in 1978 with the rank of colonel. Farrell's daughter, Barbara Vucanovich, was the first woman from Nevada to be elected to the United States House of Representatives, serving from 1983 to 1997. His granddaughter, Patricia Dillon Cafferata, served as Nevada State Treasurer from 1983 to 1987. Farrell died at Saint Mary's Hospital in Reno, Nevada, on 11 April 1967. His wife Ynez had died the year before. Ironically, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> spent a lifetime building things was principally remembered for the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, both of Wiesenthal's {{employers}} terminated {{his services}} in 1960, {{as there were}} too few refugees left {{in the city to}} justify the expense. Wiesenthal opened a new documentation centre (the Documentation Centre of the Association of Jewish Victims of the Nazi Regime) in Vienna in 1961. He became a Mossad operative, for which he received the equivalent of several hundred dollars per month. He maintained files on hundreds of suspected Nazi war criminals and located many, about six of whom were arrested {{as a result of his}} activities. Successes included locating and bringing to trial Erich Rajakowitsch, responsible for the deportation of Jews from the Netherlands, and Franz Murer, the commandant of the Vilna Ghetto. In 1963 Wiesenthal read in the newspaper that Karl Silberbauer, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> arrested famed diarist Anne Frank, had been located; he was serving on the police force in Vienna. Wiesenthal's publicity campaign led to Silberbauer being temporarily suspended from the force, but he was never prosecuted for arresting the Frank family.|$|E
