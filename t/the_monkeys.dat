5|$|Certain {{bird species}} {{associate}} with the Central American squirrel monkey. The birds follow <b>the</b> <b>monkeys</b> {{in an attempt to}} prey on insects and small vertebrates that <b>the</b> <b>monkeys</b> flush out. At Corcovado National Park, bird species known to regularly follow squirrel monkeys include the double-toothed kite, the grey-headed tanager and the tawny-winged woodcreeper, but other woodcreepers and such species as motmots and trogons do so as well. This activity increases during the wet season, when arthropods are harder to find.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} when Specter, a white-haired monkey who is {{well-known}} {{at his home}} in a monkey-themed amusement park, puts on an experimental Peak Point Helmet created by a Professor, which increases his intelligence beyond that of a regular monkey, but also twists his mind, turning him evil. Imbued with this new power, Specter gives Pipo Helmets to all <b>the</b> <b>monkeys</b> in the park and sets them loose, having them take over the local laboratory where the Professor and his assistant Natalie (Katie/Natsumi) are currently building a time machine. As Spike (Kakeru) and his best friend Jake (Buzz/Hiroki) arrive at the laboratory, they find themselves transported by Specter, along with all the other monkeys, to the various reaches of time. Realizing that leaving <b>the</b> <b>monkeys</b> to their own devices could rewrite history in disastrous ways, the Professor tasks Spike with finding all of <b>the</b> <b>monkeys</b> scattered across time and sending them back to the present.|$|E
5|$|At {{a border}} {{post on the}} way to Paraguay, Cacambo and Candide speak to the commandant, who turns out to be Cunégonde's unnamed brother. He {{explains}} that after his family was slaughtered, the Jesuits' preparation for his burial revived him, and he has since joined the order. When Candide proclaims he intends to marry Cunégonde, her brother attacks him, and Candide runs him through with his rapier. After lamenting all the people (mainly priests) he has killed, he and Cacambo flee. In their flight, Candide and Cacambo come across two naked women being chased and bitten by a pair of monkeys. Candide, seeking to protect the women, shoots and kills <b>the</b> <b>monkeys,</b> but is informed by Cacambo that <b>the</b> <b>monkeys</b> and women were probably lovers.|$|E

5|$|When {{animals are}} faced with a choice to either wait for a reward, or receive a reward right away, the {{discounting}} of the reward is hyperbolic. As the length of time of waiting for a reward increases, the reward is discounted at a gradual rate. Empirical data have suggested that exponential discounting, rewards discounting at a constant rate per unit of waiting time, only occurs when there are random interruptions in foraging. Discounting can also be related to the risk sensitivity of animals. Rather than relating risk to delay, risk sensitivity acts as a function of delay discounting. In a study conducted by Haden and Platt, macaque monkeys were given the choice of a medium reward that they knew they would receive, versus a more risky choice. The riskier choice would reward the monkey with a large reward fifty percent of the time, and a small reward the other fifty percent. The ultimate payoff was the same, but <b>the</b> <b>monkeys</b> preferred the riskier choice. They speculated that <b>the</b> <b>monkeys</b> did not see their action as risky, but rather as a large, delayed reward. They reasoned that <b>the</b> <b>monkeys</b> viewed the large reward as certain: if they did not get the large reward the first time around, they would eventually get it, but at a longer delay.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have adapted}} to fill many open {{ecological}} niches since making their way to Madagascar. Their diversity in both behavior and morphology (outward appearance) rivals that of <b>the</b> <b>monkeys</b> and apes found elsewhere in the world. Ranging in size from the 30g (1.1oz) Madame Berthe's mouse lemur, the world's smallest primate, to the recently extinct 160–200kg (350–440lb) Archaeoindris fontoynonti, lemurs evolved diverse forms of locomotion, varying levels of social complexity, and unique adaptations to the local climate.|$|E

Eventually servants arrived and chased away <b>the</b> <b>monkeys,</b> and the king's wounds were promptly cleaned and dressed but not cauterized.

5|$|Peet {{decided to}} follow closely the dramatic, dark, and {{sinister}} tone of Kipling's book, {{which is about the}} struggles between animals and man. However, the film's writers decided to make the story more straightforward, as the novel is very episodic, with Mowgli going {{back and forth from the}} jungle to the Man-Village, and Peet felt that Mowgli returning to the Man-Village should be the ending for the film. Following suggestions, Peet also created two original characters: The human girl for which Mowgli falls in love, as the animators considered that falling in love would be the best excuse for Mowgli to leave the jungle; and Louie, king of <b>the</b> <b>monkeys.</b> Louie was a less comical character, enslaving Mowgli trying to get the boy to teach him to make fire. The orangutan would also show a plot point borrowed from The Second Jungle Book, gold and jewels under his ruins— after Mowgli got to the man village, a poacher would drag the boy back to the ruins in search for the treasure. Disney was not pleased with how the story was turning out, as he felt it was too dark for family viewing and insisted on script changes. Peet refused, and after a long argument, Peet left the Disney studio in January 1964.|$|E
5|$|Stocks were {{increased}} by animals transferred from other zoos {{that had been}} forced to close. Initially the zoo was given favourable food rationing quotas, but certain foods became unavailable and the price of others increased dramatically. Bananas were impossible to obtain and the supply of fish was problematic. As a result, the keepers were forced to experiment. The sealions became casualties of the food shortage when their keepers attempted to feed them strips of beef soaked in cod liver oil. Although they seemed to thrive on this diet, their digestive systems were unable to cope with the unusual food, and they eventually died of stomach ulcers. The lions' new diet was green-coloured horsemeat, and <b>the</b> <b>monkeys</b> were fed on boiled potatoes. The birds-of-paradise (lack of millet), and the penguins (lack of fish), were unable to adapt to their make-do diet and also succumbed. Vegetables were not in short supply however, as the garden staff grew lettuce, cabbage and carrots in the kitchen gardens.|$|E
5|$|The {{other boys}} find Pi Pi, who informs them the park can be drained of the {{inundation}} if someone can swim through the pee {{to reach an}} emergency release valve. Kyle reluctantly agrees {{to do the job}} as he said {{at the start of the}} episode that he could hold his breath for the longest, but is horrified to learn he must drink some of the pee in order to offset the fluid pressure he will encounter at the depths. Outside, an antidote that keeps <b>the</b> <b>monkeys</b> calm during yet another urination test is discovered: bananas. Back inside the park, Kyle reluctantly drinks a jarful of pee in preparation for his plunge into the flood. Just after he finishes the jar, helicopters arrive as part of the rescue mission, which made Kyle extremely furious for drinking pee for nothing. After escaping the pee-filled water park, Cartman reunites with his friends, and is glad that he isn't the last of the species and he declares that he will live up to the fullest. Kyle angrily says that he has to get his stomach pumped at the hospital. Stan reassures that it's only a little pee. Kyle angrily complains that bananas are more disgusting than pee. The water tester doles out bananas to the kids. The fire marshal tells them that they must eat their bananas immediately, but a police officer aims his gun at Kyle, saying that he must do it, or he'll be put down and Kyle yells in frustration.|$|E

The participants completed computerized verbal and visual-spatial working memory tasks (i. e., <b>the</b> <b>Monkey</b> game and <b>the</b> Lion game) and a paper-and-pencil version of Raven’s Standard Progressive Matrices. Reading comprehension and math achievement test scores were obtained from the schools. First, the internal consistency of <b>the</b> <b>Monkey</b> game was examined.

Multilevel multivariate regression analysis was used to examine <b>the</b> <b>Monkey</b> game’s concurrent relationship with the Lion game and its predictive relationships with reading comprehension and math achievement. Also, age-related differences in performance were examined.
