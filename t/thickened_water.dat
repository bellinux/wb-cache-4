5000|$|The winter road is {{constructed}} by Nuna Logistics and RTL-Robinson every January and takes {{about six weeks}} to complete. The first vehicle along each season is a Swedish-made Hägglund army-type reconnaissance vehicle designed to float if it falls through the ice; it tows an ice-thickness-detecting sonar. This is followed by road building equipment including [...] "specialized low ground pressure equipment". The road, built extra wide to avoid blockages during blizzards and to allow opposing trucks to pass, is kept clear of snow, which acts as insulation, throughout the season as removal allows the ice to freeze faster and thicker. The road is 50 m wide on the ice, but narrower on land portages ranging between 12 and 15 m wide. Once initially built, the road is checked by drilling holes into the ice. If the ice needs to be <b>thickened,</b> <b>water</b> trucks are called in to add water to that specific area. The road is only operational during February and March, an average of 67 days per year. The ice has been proven by engineers to support light vehicle loads at 70 cm and increasing to full highway truck loads as the ice thickens. A thickness of 107 cm is required for a super B tanker carrying up to 50000 L and may weigh up to 42 t.|$|E

40|$|Background: Clinical {{evaluation}} of swallowing disorders postextubation is often neglected. Videofluoroscopy is {{the gold standard}} with fiber-optic endoscopic {{evaluation of}} swallowing (FEES) having a high sensitivity. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the correlations between clinical, FEES, and videofluoroscopic evaluations in the intensive care unit. Methods: Twenty-one patients extubated after prolonged intubation were subjected to a clinical evaluation of swallowing and FEES within 24 hours. This was repeated at 48 hours with a videofluoroscopic evaluation with identical swallowing-namely, boluses of liquid and <b>thickened</b> <b>water.</b> The patients were scored from 0 (normal) to 3 (worst). Results: There was no correlation between the oral phase (bedside evaluation) and FEES. The correlation between pharyngeal phase (palatal and laryngeal elevation, pharyngeal rales, and gag reflex) before and after swallowing at 24 and 48 hours was statistically significant (liquid water P =. 025 [24 hours] vs P <. 001 [48 hours]; <b>thickened</b> <b>water</b> P <. 001 [24 and 48 hours]). Clinical assessment, although not statistically significant, failed to detect silent aspiration (P =. 58). There was a good correlation between FEES and videofluoroscopy as opposed to clinical assessment and videofluoroscopy (P <. 001 vs P =. 762). Conclusion: Cough is a reliable sign of swallowing disorder but does not exclude silent aspiration and contraindicates oral feeding. Cough induced by liquid water should lead to modification of diet in terms of consistency and viscosity with cough reassessment. © 2011 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.

40|$|Non-Newtonian fluids, such as polymer solutions, {{have been}} used by the oil {{industry}} for many years as fracturing agents and drilling mud. These solutions, which normally include <b>thickened</b> <b>water</b> and jelled fluids, are injected into the formation to enhanced oil recovery by improving sweep efficiency. It is worth noting that some heavy oils behave non-Newtonianly. Non-Newtonian fluids do not have direct proportionality between applied shear stress and shear rate and viscosity varies with shear rate depending on whether the fluid is either pseudoplastic or dilatant. Viscosity decreases as shear rate increases for the former whilst the reverse takes place for dilatants. Mathematical models of conventional fluids thus fail when applied to non-Newtonian fluids. The pressure derivative curve is introduced in this descriptive work for a dilatant fluid and its pattern was observed. Tiab’s direct synthesis (TDS) methodology was used as a tool for interpreting pressure transient data to estimate effective permeability, skin factors and non-Newtonian bank radius.

One of the most widely forms of polymer application in oil and gas industry is related to coating of proppant in hydraulic fracturing (HF) operation. Proppants are small spheres that must have enough strength to withstand to high closure stresses. Application of polymers for coating of proppants is just emerging in recent years and promises higher performance by taking the both of strength and flexibility context into account. Coating of proppant with a thin layer of polymer will results in higher fracture conductivity, considerably reduce fines generation and scaling, thereby improving the quality of HF treatment.

40|$|Extending Turkish {{traditional}} arts {{into next}} generations is quite important in ensuring {{the sustainability of}} our visual culture. Therefore; {{it is necessary to}} integrate this extension in visual arts education as well. This study specifically deals with “marbling”,one of the traditional arts in Turkish culture. Marbling art used to be applied especially on the covers of old books and to linebook bindings. It can be defined as making some patterns on <b>thickened</b> <b>water</b> by using soil and dry paints. In other words, wateris condensed with a special substance, and then paints that are insoluble in water are sprayed on the surface of water and finallythe patterns on the water surface are transferred onto a sheet of paper. As a paper decoration art, marbling is acquired through master-apprentice circle similar to all Ottoman arts and quite prone tobe affected by many factors that are not controlled by craftsmen. Although some resources state that the word Ebru (marbling) comes from the word “ab-ı ru”, which means “water for face” or from the word “ebre” which means “patterned paper or cloth”in Çagatay language, a Middle Asian language, the mostly agreed opinion is that the origin of the word Ebru is the word “ebri”which means “cloud-like, or losing its importance and even being a dead art. cloudy” in Persian language. Despite the fact thatmarbling is one of our traditional arts used in many decorations in the past, today there is still a risk ofThe aim of the study is to introduce “marbling” art to primary school students and to increase awareness of our visual cultureby preserving traditional and aesthetical values through the use of this art in different daily objects. In order to obtain students’opinions regarding marbling application, the students were asked to answer the following questions:What did you feel while working on the marbling application?In your opinion, {{what is the difference between}} marbling and other similarapplications (drawing by using crayons and aquarelle) ?Where else can you use “marbling?”Would you like to continue doing this art in the future?In this study, fifth year students in primary schools (11 years old) were given information about marbling and given theopportunity to explore this art through practical applications without being forced to use all the complex technical features ofmarbling. Later, they were asked to use their products on some objects they use daily, such as bookmarks, photo frames, pencilbox etc. and, at the end of the application, semi-structured interviews were made to learn about their opinions regarding theapplication. Finally, the findings gathered from the interviews and documentation analysis were presented as frequency distributions. The audio recorded interviews were transcribed by the researcher and transcription codes were prepared for eachstudent interviewed based on the interview questions and the answers. This descriptive study uses qualitative research method in data collection, analysis and interpretations phases. Purposefulsampling method was used to determine the school where the study was conducted. The basic idea behind sampling method, atype of purposeful sampling, is to study all the conditions that meet a pre-determined criterion. Here, the criteria determined bythe researcher can be used as well as a pre-determined criterion. The subjects of this study were 25 students attending fifth gradeclass in Private Cagdas Primary School located in Eskisehir. The majority of the students participating in the study considered the practice “a very nice work”, “like a game” and “fun”. Similarly, almost half of the students stated that the work was “different” and “unbelievable”. Some students said that they feltthat paints are floating on water surface. A few students mentioned that “it is like a magic”, one student “I felt that I didsomething special for the first time in my life” and another student “ I felt that I painted on the water”. As for the difference ofmarbling from other arts, most students stated: “not being able to control the spread of paints” and “intermingling of colors”. Half of the students mentioned they completed the work in a very short time compared to other art practices. Majority of thestudents pointed out they can use marbling on many daily objects such as picture frames, bookmarks, and plastic bags and otherobjects such as notebook covers, t-shirts, earrings, necklaces, different cloths and in kite making. In addition, all students statedthat they wanted to make marbling again. In this study, the students made 23 bookmarks, 13 photo frames, 2 pencil boxes, and 3 paper bags. Two of the studentswanted to hang their works on the wall of their rooms, therefore; they did not give these works a daily object function. Afterfinishing their works, they were interviewed to have their opinions regarding this activity. Almost all of the students stated thatthey knew this marbling art but have never applied it in their lives. All of the students told that they liked marbling and did thisactivity like a game and they found the colour diffusions amazing. Although related literature suggests that marbling is a demanding and challenging art, it can be integrated into primary schoolcurriculum by using ready-made paints and kitre (a gum like substance) and by considering certain limitations such as the classhours and physical conditions. In addition, this art can be presented as a fun game activity without forcing students to applychallenging techniques. Such attempts might make it possible to transfer our traditional arts to next generations. In conclusion, most of the students participated in this activity in a way appropriate to its purposes and meaning. They wereintroduced to this traditional Turkish art by using a different way of presentation and by giving credit to traditional and aestheticvalues...|$|E

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{the water}} table in re-wetted bogs varies widely between different locations so that recolonising Sphagnum is vulnerable to water stress, especially when the water table is drawn down in summer. It {{is important to understand}} how physical site conditions influence the occurrence of water stress so that adequate management measures may be applied. In the work reported here, the respective roles of the hydrophysical properties of the uppermost peat layer and micro-scale site conditions are investigated using a Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant (SWAP) model, which simulates water table fluctuations and soil moisture conditions. The variables are: (a) cover and thickness of the Sphagnum layer, (b) microtopography (presence of open water), (c) hydrophysical properties of the uppermost soil layer and (d) rate of downward seepage. Data for the model are derived from field observations, from published literature, and from laboratory determinations of moisture characteristic curves and saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (k¿h¿¿ relationships) for peat. The simulation indicates that microtopography and the thickness of the moss layer are the dominant factors affecting groundwater behaviour and the risk of water stress. Sphagnum layers a few centimetres thick should be relatively well supplied with water from the underlying peat but as the Sphagnum carpet <b>thickens,</b> <b>water</b> movement through the unsaturated zone to the growing capitula will become increasingly difficult. Sphagnum layers appear to be most vulnerable to water stress when they are 5 ¿ 15 cm thick. Beyond this thickness, water stored within the Sphagnum layer itself begins to offset the decline in the flux from below, and thus to reduce the dependence {{of the water}} supply to the stem tips on the maintenance of hydraulic continuity with the water table. The results obtained using the model underline the close interdependence between Sphagnum development and the accompanying changes in soil hydrophysics during the re-wetting phases of bog restoration projects...|$|R

Ability to <b>thicken</b> <b>water</b> solutions are among such properties, to form jellies, to create emulsions, foams, to act as their stabilizers, to connect heavy metals, etc. Beet and wheat celluloses promote preservation of juiciness and decrease in losses at heat treatment, stabilize a good trade dress of finished products from chopped meat. Their introduction in minced products – chopped semi-finished products, pastes, canned food is most expedient.

Moreover, in some of the core scale waterflood experiments reported using 2 D slabs of Bentheimer sandstone, X-ray scans performed during the flooding sequence provided evidence of an interesting new phenomenon – post breakthrough, highly dendritic water fingers were seen to thicken and coalesce, forming braided water channels and improving sweep efficiency.

This means that the optimization of this process for eventual field applications is still somewhat problematic. Ideally, a combination of two-phase flow experiments and simulations should be put in place to help inform our understanding of the process.

5000|$|Collenchyma is Greek word where [...] "Collen" [...] means gum and [...] "chyma" [...] means infusion. It is {{a living}} tissue of primary body like Parenchyma. Cells are {{thin-walled}} but possess <b>thickening</b> of cellulose, <b>water</b> and pectin substances (pectocellulose) at the corners where number of cells join together. This tissue gives a tensile strength to the plant and the cells are compactly arranged and have very little inter-cellular spaces. It occurs chiefly in hypodermis of stems and leaves. It is absent in monocots and in roots.|$|R
40|$|As of today, several {{technologies}} {{are available for}} thickening waste activated sludge. Presently gravity belt thickeners (GBTs) {{tend to be the}} most commonly installed for waste activated sludge <b>thickening</b> applications (<b>Water</b> Environment Federation, 2012). However, new advancements in thickening centrifuges give {{reason to believe that the}} centrifuge may be economically competitive with GBTs and other thickening technologies moving forward, creating a need to compare the economic favorability of each process. In addition, little research has presently been completed in assessing the environmental impact of thickening technologies. Thus, the objective of this study was to compare GBTs with a novel centrifugal thickening technology and compare them on the basis of performance, economy, and environmental impact. GBTs were found to utilize less power than the centrifugal thickener however reduction in the amount of polymer consumed gave a large advantage to the centrifugal thickening technology over the GBT, specifically for larger sized plants...|$|R
40|$|With {{the same}} {{chemical}} compounds as the imported class G cement {{used for the}} oil and gas wells cementing jobs; further suitability studies on the physical properties of pulverize fly ash cement were carried out to determine its real potential. Compressive strength, free <b>water,</b> <b>thickening</b> time and fluid loss tests were carried out according to API Specification 10. Samples were prepared with oil well additives and were conducted at simulated reservoir condition at 8000 feet. Comparison results with class G cement proved that blended cement suits to be used for oil well cementing job...|$|R
50|$|Once {{the salt}} water has dried, {{the second step}} is {{creating}} the abstract image of choice. The solution used to <b>thicken</b> the <b>water</b> will differ with each body marbling company or group, as many agents can be used. M. Pantrey of the site Superpants reported effectively using guar gum. Most body marbling tanks can be cleared with paper towel after each painting, so the colors can be changed for each individual's preference. Drops of paint {{are added to the}} surface until the surface tension is adequate for the dipping. If the colors are not concentrated enough on the surface, the resulting painting on skin will look faded or translucent. Participants are then instructed to slowly dip their arms straight down in one motion, allowing the paint to smoothly adhere to the skin. Excessive motion will distort the image on the surface, and the remaining color on skin will look fuzzy. It only takes one short dip to transfer the images, and the arms can be immediately removed from the tank.|$|R
60|$|If the {{sun rose}} clear, it was {{overcast}} in a few hours; then the clouds broke and let a little sunshine through, to close again before the dim evening <b>thickened</b> over the <b>waters.</b> Sometimes the moon looked through the ragged curtain of vapors; one night it seemed to shine till morning, and shook a path of quicksilver from the horizon to the ship. Through every change, after {{she had left the}} fog behind, the steamer drove on with the pulse of her engines (that stopped no more than a man's heart stops) in a course which had nothing to mark it but the spread of the furrows from her sides, and the wake that foamed from her stern to the western verge of the sea.|$|R
