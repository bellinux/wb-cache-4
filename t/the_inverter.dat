5|$|The VFD {{controller}} is a solid-state {{power electronics}} conversion system consisting of three distinct sub-systems: a rectifier bridge converter, a direct current (DC) link, and an inverter. Voltage-source inverter (VSI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below) {{are by far}} {{the most common type of}} drives. Most drives are AC-AC drives in that they convert AC line input to AC inverter output. However, in some applications such as common DC bus or solar applications, drives are configured as DC-AC drives. The most basic rectifier converter for the VSI drive is configured as a three-phase, six-pulse, full-wave diode bridge. In a VSI drive, the DC link consists of a capacitor which smooths out the converter's DC output ripple and provides a stiff input to <b>the</b> <b>inverter.</b> This filtered DC voltage is converted to quasi-sinusoidal AC voltage output using the inverter's active switching elements. VSI drives provide higher power factor and lower harmonic distortion than phase-controlled current-source inverter (CSI) and load-commutated inverter (LCI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below). The drive controller can also be configured as a phase converter having single-phase converter input and three-phase inverter output.|$|E
25|$|Inversion of Generation 2 devices was {{achieved}} {{through one of}} two different ways. <b>The</b> <b>Inverter</b> tube uses electrostatic inversion, {{in the same manner}} as the first generation tubes did, with a MCP included.

30|$|<b>The</b> {{auxiliary}} <b>inverter</b> processes only {{reactive power}} {{to compensate the}} distortion in <b>the</b> main <b>inverter</b> current. <b>The</b> auxiliary <b>inverter</b> is controlled via the hysteresis current control (HCC). The operating frequency varies owing to HCC, but it is always {{higher than that of}} <b>the</b> main <b>inverter.</b> <b>The</b> power processed by <b>the</b> auxiliary <b>inverter</b> is low. Hence, the losses on <b>the</b> auxiliary <b>inverter</b> are very low. The DC-link voltage of <b>the</b> auxiliary <b>inverter</b> is obtained from the grid via the current control.|$|R
40|$|In many countries, the grid-code or {{standards}} do {{not allow}} <b>the</b> Photovoltaic (PV) <b>inverters</b> to exchange reactive power with the grid. Recently, some countries have relaxed the standards. Hence, capacity of <b>the</b> <b>inverters</b> to control reactive power must be utilized. However, the reactive power that a PV inverter can supply is constrained by the maximum power that a PV array generates and changes with the environmental conditions. A reactive power sharing algorithm is proposed that not only ensures proper distribution of reactive power amongst <b>the</b> <b>inverters,</b> but also ensures that the maximum power generated by PV is supplied to the grid. In case of identical PV <b>inverters,</b> <b>the</b> algorithm operates all inverters at nearly equal apparent power leading to nearly equal percentage utilization of <b>the</b> <b>inverters,</b> thereby achieving uniform heating of the similar devices of <b>the</b> <b>inverters.</b> <b>The</b> algorithms are further investigated for power sharing amongst PV inverters of unequal ratings. It is highlighted that the proposed algorithm results into the least change in the utilization factor of a PV inverter, whose power changes due to the change in environmental conditions. The effectiveness of the algorithm over other algorithms in sharing power amongst inverters is displayed through MATLAB/Simulink simulations...|$|R

25|$|CCFL: The LCD {{panel is}} lit either by two cold cathode {{fluorescent}} lamps placed at opposite {{edges of the}} display or an array of parallel CCFLs behind larger displays. A diffuser then spreads the light out evenly across the whole display. For many years, this technology had been used almost exclusively. Unlike white LEDs, most CCFLs have an even-white spectral output resulting in better color gamut for the display. However, CCFLs are less energy efficient than LEDs and require a somewhat costly inverter to convert whatever DC voltage the device uses (usually 5 or 12V) to ~1000 V needed to light a CCFL. The thickness of <b>the</b> <b>inverter</b> transformers also limits how thin the display can be made.|$|E

2500|$|Before Tesla had {{developed}} the Roadster's proprietary powertrain, they borrowed an AC Propulsion Tzero vehicle {{as a test}} mule and converted from Lead Acid AGM batteries to Lithium Ion cells which substantially increased the range, reduced weight, and boosted 0-60 performance.
