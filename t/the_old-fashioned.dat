5|$|The episode {{replaced}} {{a different}} script Whithouse {{had planned to}} write, and {{was designed to be}} a romantic episode that could also be a good introduction to the show. Whithouse chose the setting to be Venice, and vampires soon entered the plot as he felt they belonged in the setting. The episode was filmed in Trogir, Croatia in late 2009, with <b>the</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> village portraying Venice. The episode was seen by 7.68 million viewers in the UK and received an Appreciation Index of 86. The episode received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the comedy, production design, and acting of guests Helen McCrory and Alex Price, but thought that the plot elements were somewhat similar to a couple of other recent episodes.|$|E

25|$|It {{was here}} the first {{improvements}} in modelling took place, <b>the</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> counter was abolished, {{and all the}} planking turned up to the arch-board; <b>the</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> stern-frame and transoms were done away with, and the vessel framed all round the stern. The first clipper stem was her put up that was seen on the Wear, and was, {{as it was then}} termed, turned inside out and upside down, and which is still continued by the builders on the Wear up to the present day.(1874). Pile was the first to introduce the Clipper class of vessel to Sunderland and by his skill in building them he gained recognition in the nautical world.|$|E

25|$|The {{influence}} of the American circus brought about a considerable change {{in the character of}} the modern circus.

The open platform, while exposed to the elements, allowed boarding and alighting in places other than official stops; {{and the presence of}} a conductor allowed minimal boarding time and optimal security, but with greater labour costs.|$|E

25|$|Originally {{the knight}} {{characters}} {{were going to}} ride real horses, but after {{it became clear that}} the film's small budget precluded real horses, the Pythons decided that their characters would mime horse-riding while their porters trotted behind them banging coconut shells together.

This was later referred to in the German release of the film, which translated the title as Die Ritter der Kokosnuß ('The Knights of the Coconut').|$|E
25|$|For a {{brief time}} in the mid-1920s, the {{architectural}} profession operated <b>the</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> manner, with private companies, international contests, competitive bidding and disputes in professional magazines.

Among these were Ernst May, Albert Kahn, Le Corbusier, Bruno Taut and Mart Stam. The difference between traditionalists and constructivists was not well defined.
