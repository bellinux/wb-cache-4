Some variations of the technique deal also with wells and parallel channels connected by a cut {{at the start of}} the experiment (PP-technique). Radial arrangement of PP-technique (3 or more channels) provides the possibility to compare chemotactic activity of different cell populations or study preference between ligands.|$|E

25|$|Chambers {{isolated}} by {{filters are}} proper tools for accurate determination of chemotactic behavior. The pioneer type of these chambers was constructed by Boyden. The motile cells are placed {{into the upper}} chamber, while fluid containing the <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> is filled into the lower one. The size of the motile cells to be investigated determines the pore size of the filter; {{it is essential to}} choose a diameter which allows active transmigration. For modelling in vivo conditions, several protocols prefer coverage of filter with molecules of extracellular matrix (collagen, elastin etc.) Efficiency of the measurements was increased by development of multiwell chambers (e.g. NeuroProbe), where 24, 96, 384 samples are evaluated in parallel. Advantage of this variant is that several parallels are assayed in identical conditions.|$|E
500|$|Irritancy can be {{measured}} using the Draize test, where a <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> is applied to an animal's eyes or skin, usually an albino rabbit. For Draize eye testing, the test involves observing {{the effects of the}} substance at intervals and grading any damage or irritation, but the test should be halted and the animal killed if it shows [...] "continuing signs of severe pain or distress". The Humane Society of the United States writes that the procedure can cause redness, ulceration, hemorrhaging, cloudiness, or even blindness. This test has also been criticized by scientists for being cruel and inaccurate, subjective, over-sensitive, and failing to reflect human exposures in the real world. Although no accepted in vitro alternatives exist, a modified form of the Draize test called the low volume eye test may reduce suffering and provide more realistic results and this was adopted as the new standard in September 2009. However, the Draize test will still be used for substances that are not severe irritants.|$|E
2500|$|The Draize Test is {{an acute}} {{toxicity}} test devised in 1944 by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) toxicologists John H. Draize and Jacob M. Spines. Initially used for testing cosmetics, the procedure involves applying 0.5mL or 0.5g of a <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> {{to the eye}} or skin of a restrained, conscious animal, and then leaving it for set amount of time before rinsing it out and recording its effects. The animals are observed for up to 14 days for signs of erythema and edema in the skin test, and redness, swelling, discharge, ulceration, hemorrhaging, cloudiness, or blindness in the tested eye. The test subject is commonly an albino rabbit, though other species are used too, including dogs. The animals are euthanized after testing if the test renders irreversible damage to the eye or skin. [...] Animals may be re-used for testing purposes if the product tested causes no permanent damage. Animals are typically reused after a [...] "wash out" [...] period during which all traces of the tested product are allowed to disperse from the test site.|$|E
