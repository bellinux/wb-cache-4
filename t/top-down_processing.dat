The ability to discriminate between internal (self-generated) and external (stimuli) sources of information is considered to be an important metacognitive skill, but one which may break down to cause hallucinatory experiences. Projection of an internal state (or a person's own reaction to another's) may arise in the form of hallucinations, especially auditory hallucinations. A recent hypothesis that is gaining acceptance concerns the role of overactive <b>top-down</b> <b>processing,</b> or strong perceptual expectations, that can generate spontaneous perceptual output (that is, hallucination).|$|E
25|$|Spreading activation, {{a process}} where similar {{concepts}} are activated when their neighbors are activated, {{is a widely}} accepted model of lexical access. It {{has been shown in}} both bilingual and monolingual individuals, with bilinguals showing activation in both languages during language research tasks. Multiple studies have shown that bilinguals recognize cognate words more quickly than non-cognate words, especially identical cognates, which produce the strongest effect. These effects occurred even when the participants knew ahead of time what language the target words would be in. Despite the specific language contexts, both languages are activated, showing that lexical access is not language-specific and that <b>top-down</b> <b>processing</b> is important in lexical access. Findings suggest that the amount of activation that occurred cross-linguistically was related to the similarity between the translation equivalents of the languages.|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea that}} {{intention}} co-occurs with (rather than causes) movement {{is reminiscent of}} [...] "forward models of motor control" [...] (or FMMC, which {{have been used to}} try to explain inner speech). FMMCs describe parallel circuits: movement is processed in parallel with other predictions of movement; if the movement matches the prediction – the feeling of agency occurs. FMMCs have been applied in other related experiments. Metcalfe and her colleagues used an FMMC to explain how volunteers determine whether they are in control of a computer game task. On the other hand, they acknowledge other factors too. The authors attribute feelings of agency to desirability of the results (see self serving biases) and <b>top-down</b> <b>processing</b> (reasoning and inferences about the situation).|$|E

The other four layers, however, are designed for implementing an attention control with high-level information processings.

40|$|This study {{tries to}} define {{listening}} comprehension and investigates effective EFL listening instructions form {{the point of}} cognitive science, based on previous studies. According to van Dijk & Kintsch(1983), the final goal of comprehension of text is to construct a coherent mental representation called situation model, in which learners complete integration of new information with their prior knowledge. To achieve this, there are two information processes involved. One is <b>top-down</b> information <b>processing,</b> in which learners try to comprehend by activating schema existing in prior knowledge. The other is called bottom-up processing, in which learners try to comprehend by starting decoding phonemes, then combining them into words, then combining words into chunks, not relying on schema. Previous studies suggest the following two things on information processing. One is that EFL learners tend to rely too mauch on <b>top-down</b> information <b>processing,</b> often resulting in communication breakdowns. The other is that new ways of effective listening instructions to facilitate date dreiven information processing are necessary to be developed. According to this claim, visual-auditory shadowing by Nakayama(2011) is determined for its prossibility. 本稿は、 2011 年度城西大学教員免許状更新講習において用いたテキストに大幅に、加筆および修正を加えたものであ...|$|R

50|$|Attention can {{be guided}} by <b>top-down</b> <b>processing</b> or via bottom up processing. Posner's model of {{attention}} includes a posterior attentional system involved in the disengagement of stimuli via the parietal cortex, the shifting of attention via the superior colliculus and the engagement of a new target via the pulvinar.

40|$|Discovering the {{structure}} {{inherent in a}} set of patterns is a fundamental aim of statistical inference or learning. One fruitful approach is to build a parameterised stochastic generative model, independent draws from which are likely to produce the patterns. For all but the simplest generative models, each pattern can be generated in exponentially many ways. It is thus intractable to adjust the parameters to maximize the probability of the observed patterns, We describe a way of finessing this combinatorial explosion by maximising an easily computed lower bound on the probability of the observations. Our method {{can be viewed as a}} form of hierarchical self-supervised learning that may relate to the function of bottom-up and <b>top-down</b> cortical <b>processing</b> pathways. ...|$|R

Despite recent successes of feedforward processing on the abstraction of concepts form raw images, the inherent nature of feedback processing has remained computationally controversial. Inspired by the computational models of covert visual attention, we propose the Selective Tuning of Convolutional Networks (STNet). It {{is composed of}} both streams of Bottom-Up and <b>Top-Down</b> information <b>processing</b> to selectively tune the visual representation of Convolutional networks.

50|$|The visual P2 {{has also}} been studied {{in the context of}} the visual priming paradigm, which seeks to {{understand}} how prior information shapes future response. In this experimental design, participants are briefly presented with an image or word, followed by a delay, and a subsequent stimulus upon which participants must make a classification. Researchers have used the visual search paradigm with stimulus arrays and found that target stimuli elicited larger anterior P2 components compared with standards. This evidence suggests that <b>top-down</b> information <b>processing</b> about feature classification affected processing at the visual perception stage. Thus, the P2 may index mechanisms for selective attention, feature detection (including color, orientation, shape, etc.) and other early stages of item encoding.|$|R

50|$|In {{everyday}} situations, {{people are}} most commonly searching their visual fields for targets that {{are familiar to}} them. When it comes to searching for familiar stimuli, <b>top-down</b> <b>processing</b> allows one to more efficiently identify targets with greater complexity than can be represented in a feature or conjunction search task. In a study done to analyze the reverse-letter effect, which {{is the idea that}} identifying the asymmetric letter amongst symmetric letters is more efficient than its reciprocal, researchers concluded that individuals more efficiently recognize an asymmetric letter amongst symmetric letters due to top-down processes. Top-down processes allowed study participants to access prior knowledge regarding shape recognition of the letter N and quickly eliminate the stimuli that matched their knowledge. In the real world, one must use his prior knowledge everyday in order to accurately and efficiently locate his phone, keys, etc. amongst a much more complex array of distractors. While bottom-up processes may come into play when identifying objects that are not as familiar to a person, overall <b>top-down</b> <b>processing</b> highly influences visual searches that occur in everyday life.|$|E

In addition, both native and non-native speakers perceived the present and absent nasals significantly more than liquids. The only difference between native and non-native speakers was the lexical support for perception; while native speakers perceived the present and absent phoneme in words better than non-words, non-native speakers perceived the present and absent phoneme in words and non-words equivalently (a significant three-way interaction among noise, phonemes, and lexicality, and a significant four-way interaction among noise, phonemes, lexicality, and language factors). Phonemic restoration seems to take place differently with the different ratio of bottom-up acoustic <b>processing</b> and <b>top-down</b> lexical <b>processing</b> among native and non-native speakers.|$|R
50|$|The second {{aspect is}} called <b>top-down</b> <b>processing,</b> {{also known as}} goal-driven, {{endogenous}} attention, attentional control or executive attention. This aspect of our attentional orienting is {{under the control of}} the person who is attending. It is mediated primarily by the frontal cortex and basal ganglia as one of the executive functions.

50|$|These {{findings}} complement {{evolutionary psychology}} theories that affective states serve adaptive functions in promoting suitable cognitive strategies {{to deal with}} environmental challenges. Positive affect is associated with assimilative, <b>top-down</b> <b>processing</b> used in response to familiar, benign environments. Negative affect is connected with accommodative, bottom-up processing in response to unfamiliar, or problematic environments. Thus, positive affectivity promotes simplistic heuristic approaches that rely on preexisting knowledge and assumptions. Conversely, negative affectivity promotes controlled, analytic approaches that rely on externally drawn information.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the Gestalt principles of perception, water-color illusions contribute {{to the formation of}} optical illusions. Water-color illusions consist of object-hole effects and coloration. Object-hole effects occur when boundaries are prominent where there is a figure and background with a hole that is 3D volumetric in appearance. Coloration consists of an assimilation of color radiating from a thin-colored edge lining a darker chromatic contour. The water-color illusion describes how the human mind perceives the wholeness of an object such as <b>top-down</b> <b>processing.</b> Thus, contextual factors play into perceiving the brightness of an object.|$|E
40|$|Whilst {{humans have}} a large brain with {{regional}} specialization for solving complex tasks (Kandel et al., 2000), in certain cases the miniature brain of invertebrates performs analogous tasks.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to animal studies, relatively {{little is known}} about the functional significance of the early evoked gamma band activity in humans. We investigated whether evoked and induced 40 Hz activity differentiate automatic, bottom-up aspects of attention from voluntary, top-down related attentional demands. An auditory novelty-oddball task was applied to 14 healthy subjects. As predicted, more evoked gamma was found for the target condition than in the two task-irrelevant conditions. Since gamma band activity was not enhanced for novel stimuli, the evoked gamma response cannot be explained with a simple concept of stimulus arousal. Neither induced gamma nor the degree of 40 Hz phase-locking were different between the experimental conditions. Taken together, our data emphasize the role of evoked gamma band activity for <b>top-down</b> attentional <b>processing...</b>|$|R

50|$|The dorsolateral {{prefrontal cortex}} (DLPFC) works in {{conjunction}} with the ACC, and acts as the overseer of the reaction to the racial conflict. It is the main region activated in <b>top-down</b> <b>processing.</b> The DLPFC controls the emotional response through interactions with the amygdala connected through the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. The DLPFC suppresses the amygdala activity to lower the initial racial bias and resolve the conflict. Suppression of the DLPFC through TMS techniques has made the patients increase their expression of racial bias. The DLPFC function is determined by internal beliefs and awareness of societal attitudes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{prefrontal cortex}} is of {{significant}} importance when <b>top-down</b> <b>processing</b> is needed. <b>Top-down</b> <b>processing</b> by definition is when behavior {{is guided by}} internal states or intentions. According to the two, “The PFC is critical in situations when the mappings between sensory inputs, thoughts, and actions either are weakly established relative to other existing ones or are rapidly changing”. An example {{of this can be}} portrayed in the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Subjects engaging in this task are instructed to sort cards according to the shape, color, or number of symbols appearing on them. The thought is that any given card can be associated with a number of actions and no single stimulus-response mapping will work. Human subjects with PFC damage are able to sort the card in the initial simple tasks, but unable to do so as the rules of classification change. [...] Miller and Cohen conclude that the implications of their theory can explain how much of a role the PFC has in guiding control of cognitive actions. In the researchers' own words, they claim that, “depending on their target of influence, representations in the PFC can function variously as attentional templates, rules, or goals by providing top-down bias signals {{to other parts of the}} brain that guide the flow of activity along the pathways needed to perform a task”.|$|E

40|$|Empathy is {{the ability}} to {{experience}} and understand what others feel without confusion between oneself and others. Knowing what someone else is feeling plays a fundamental role in interpersonal interactions. In this paper, we articulate evidence from social psychology and cognitive neuroscience, and argue that empathy involves both emotion sharing (bottom-up information processing) and executive control to regulate and modulate this experience (<b>top-down</b> information <b>processing),</b> underpinned by specific and interacting neural systems. Furthermore, awareness of a distinction between the experiences of the self and others constitutes a crucial aspect of empathy. We discuss data from recent behavioral and functional neuroimaging studies with an emphasis on the perception of pain in others, and highlight the role of different neural mechanisms that underpin the experience of empathy, including emotion sharing, perspective taking, and emotion regulation...|$|R
30|$|The {{influences}} of top-down processes are also emphasized {{in a previous}} attempt by Patterson et al. (2014) to extend visualization cognition theories to decision making. The Patterson et al. (2014) model illustrates how <b>top-down</b> cognitive <b>processing</b> influences encoding, pattern recognition, and working memory, but not decision making or the response. Patterson et al. (2014) use the multicomponent definition of working memory, proposed by Baddeley and Hitch (1974) and summarized by Cowan (2017) as a “multicomponent system that holds information temporarily and mediates its use in ongoing mental activities” (p. 1160). In this conception of working memory, a central executive controls the functions of working memory. The central executive can, among other functions, control attention and hold information in a visuo-spatial temporary store, which is where information can be maintained temporally for decision making without being stored in long-term memory (Baddeley & Hitch, 1974).|$|R
