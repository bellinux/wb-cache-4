25|$|On September 5, after further {{evidence}} {{was written in}} the record and the prosecution and defense made their closing statements, Ward formally sentenced Heirens to three life terms. As Heirens waited to be transferred to Stateville Prison from the Cook County Jail, Sheriff Michael Mulcahy asked Heirens if Suzanne Degnan suffered when she was killed. Heirens answered:I can't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> she suffered, Sheriff Mulcahy. I didn't kill her. Tell Mr. Degnan to please look after his other daughter, because whoever killed Suzanne is still out there.|$|E
25|$|This is {{something}} that a Muslim gynecologist can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> you need to or not… There {{used to be a}} lady who used to do this for women, or, I mean, young girls. She is expected to cut only the tip of the sexual sensitive part in the girl, so that she is not hypersexually active. This is the purpose... you see in societies where circumcision of girls is completely prohibited, hypersexuality takes over the entire society, and a woman is not satisfied with one person, or two, or three. This, God forbid, is now happening even in Muslim societies where they prohibit circumcision. They use a mistake in practice to prohibit the tradition, and they end up causing a lot of damage on the extreme side of the sexual life of the woman.|$|E

For me, it's a terrible loss. I <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>if</b> you don't give it back, I'll be your enemy forever.

500|$|Three {{weeks after}} his win at Belmont, Secretariat was shipped to Arlington Park for the Arlington Invitational. Laurin explained: [...] "Even before the Belmont, you remember, I said I really didn't know how I could give this horse a rest. He's so strong and full of energy. Well, {{this is only a}} week and a half after the Belmont, and believe me when I <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>if</b> I don't run this horse he's going to hurt himself in his stall. So we decided it would be nice to race him in Chicago to let the people in the Midwest have a chance to see him run." [...] The race was run at [...] miles with a purse of $125,000. The challengers were grouped as a single betting entry at 6–1: Secretariat was 1–20 (the legal minimum) and created a minus pool of $17,941.|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "Obamacare" [...] was {{originally}} coined by opponents as a pejorative. The term emerged in March 2007 when healthcare lobbyist Jeanne Schulte Scott {{used it in}} a health industry journal, writing [...] "We will soon see a 'Giuliani-care' and 'Obama-care' {{to go along with}} 'McCain-care', 'Edwards-care', and a totally revamped and remodeled 'Hillary-care' from the 1990s". According to research by Elspeth Reeve, the expression was used in early 2007, generally by writers describing the candidate's proposal for expanding coverage for the uninsured. It first appeared in a political campaign by Mitt Romney in May 2007 in Des Moines, Iowa. Romney said, [...] "In my state, I worked on healthcare for some time. We had half a million people without insurance, and I said, 'How can we get those people insured without raising taxes and without having government take over healthcare?' And let me <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>if</b> we don't do it, the Democrats will. If the Democrats do it, it will be socialized medicine; it'll be government-managed care. It'll be what's known as Hillarycare or Barack Obamacare, {{or whatever you want to}} call it." ...|$|E
500|$|Ted Shackelford, {{who plays}} Gary, {{described}} the love story, [...] "I can't complain. I mean, Gary spent {{six or seven}} years being led down the primrose path by one stupid broad after another. So with Val... You'd think after 13 years, at the age they are [...] and the amount of bullshit they've been through, they would have learned something! They'd probably have a very comfortable life by now. But it makes for a dead story line." [...] When asked about working with Van Ark, he said: [...] "I don't know how it could get any better. [...] She's remarkable, and I'm not blowing smoke up your ass. I'd <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> I thought she was a pain in the ass, although sometimes she is a pain in the ass. But my best work is done with Joan." [...] Van Ark also discussed Valene's relationship with her daughter, Lucy Ewing. She said, [...] "The spine or the beginning of the series was Gary and Val, coming over from Dallas, so maybe there should have been more Lucy. I do know that CBS and the producers of both shows wanted to keep the two shows separate but in the beginning you had Larry Hagman and others going over to Knots." ...|$|E

2500|$|The book Frustrated Witness, {{written by}} former Miami Herald writer Willis Morgan, {{examines}} the Walsh case and cites circumstantial evidence that suggests Jeffrey Dahmer may have killed Adam Walsh. At {{the time of}} Walsh's murder, Dahmer was living a short drive away in Miami Beach and working at a sub shop where he had access to a blue van {{similar to the one}} seen leaving the mall after Walsh's disappearance. A number of witnesses reported seeing a man looking like Dahmer at the mall talking to young boys. When interviewed about Adam in the early 1990s, Dahmer repeatedly denied involvement in the crime, even stating; [...] "I've told you everything—how I killed them, how I cooked them, who I ate. Why wouldn't I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> I did someone else?" [...] After this rumor surfaced, John Walsh stated that he had [...] "seen no evidence" [...] linking his son's kidnapping and murder to Dahmer.|$|E
