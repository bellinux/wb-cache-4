5|$|Roughly {{one quarter}} of all zinc output in the United States in 2009 was {{consumed}} in zinc compounds; a variety of which are used industrially. Zinc oxide is widely used as a white pigment in paints and as a catalyst {{in the manufacture of}} rubber to disburse heat. Zinc oxide is used to protect rubber polymers and plastics from ultraviolet radiation (UV). The semiconductor properties of zinc oxide make it useful in varistors and photocopying products. The zinc zinc-oxide cycle is a two step <b>thermochemical</b> process based on zinc and zinc oxide for hydrogen production.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{chemical}} processes use solar energy to drive chemical reactions. These processes offset energy {{that would otherwise}} come from a fossil fuel source and can also convert solar energy into storable and transportable fuels. Solar induced chemical reactions {{can be divided into}} <b>thermochemical</b> or photochemical. A variety of fuels can be produced by artificial photosynthesis. The multielectron catalytic chemistry involved in making carbon-based fuels (such as methanol) from reduction of carbon dioxide is challenging; a feasible alternative is hydrogen production from protons, though use of water as the source of electrons (as plants do) requires mastering the multielectron oxidation of two water molecules to molecular oxygen. Some have envisaged working solar fuel plants in coastal metropolitan areas by 2050 the splitting of sea water providing hydrogen to be run through adjacent fuel-cell electric power plants and the pure water by-product going directly into the municipal water system. Another vision involves all human structures covering the earth's surface (i.e., roads, vehicles and buildings) doing photosynthesis more efficiently than plants.|$|E

25|$|There {{are more}} than 352 <b>thermochemical</b> cycles {{which can be used}} for water splitting, around a dozen of these cycles such as the iron oxide cycle, cerium(IV) oxide-cerium(III) oxide cycle, zinc zinc-oxide cycle, sulfur-iodine cycle, copper-chlorine cycle and hybrid sulfur cycle are under {{research}} and in testing phase to produce hydrogen and oxygen from water and heat without using electricity. These processes can be more efficient than high-temperature electrolysis, typical in the range from 35% - 49% LHV efficiency. <b>Thermochemical</b> production of hydrogen using chemical energy from coal or natural gas is generally not considered, because the direct chemical path is more efficient.|$|E

High temperature (950 to 1,000°C) gas cooled nuclear generation IV reactors have the potential to electrolyze hydrogen from water by <b>thermochemical</b> means using nuclear heat as in the sulfur-iodine cycle. The first commercial reactors are expected in 2030.|$|E
25|$|A {{particularly}} important objective, called computational thermochemistry, is to calculate <b>thermochemical</b> quantities {{such as the}} enthalpy of formation to chemical accuracy. Chemical accuracy is the accuracy required to make realistic chemical predictions and is {{generally considered to be}} 1kcal/mol or 4kJ/mol. To reach that accuracy in an economic way it is necessary to use a series of post-Hartree–Fock methods and combine the results. These methods are called quantum chemistry composite methods.|$|E
25|$|A unit {{operation}} {{is a physical}} step in an individual chemical engineering process. Unit operations (such as crystallization, filtration, drying and evaporation) are used to prepare reactants, purifying and separating its products, recycling unspent reactants, and controlling energy transfer in reactors. On the other hand, a unit process is the chemical equivalent of a {{unit operation}}. Along with unit operations, unit processes constitute a process operation. Unit processes (such as nitration and oxidation) involve the conversion of material by biochemical, <b>thermochemical</b> and other means. Chemical engineers responsible for these are called process engineers.|$|E

25|$|Molten salts can {{be highly}} {{corrosive}} and corrosivity increases with temperature. For the primary cooling loop, a material is needed that can withstand corrosion at high temperatures and intense radiation. Experiments show that Hastelloy-N and similar alloys are suited to these tasks at operating temperatures up to about 700°C. However, operating experience is limited. Still higher operating temperatures are desirable – at 850°C <b>thermochemical</b> production of hydrogen becomes possible. Materials for this temperature range have not been validated, though carbon composites, molybdenum alloys (e.g. TZM), carbides, and refractory metal based or ODS alloys might be feasible.|$|E
25|$|Blue Marble Production is a Seattle-based {{company that}} is {{dedicated}} to removing algae from algae-infested water. This in turn cleans up the environment and allows this company to produce biofuel. Rather than just focusing on the mass production of algae, this company focuses {{on what to do}} with the byproducts. This company recycles almost 100% of its water via reverse osmosis, saving about 26,000 gallons of water every month. This water is then pumped back into their system. The gas produced as a byproduct of algae will also be recycled by being placed into a photobioreactor system that holds multiple strains of algae. Whatever gas remains is then made into pyrolysis oil by <b>thermochemical</b> processes. Not only does this company seek to produce biofuel, but it also wishes to use algae for a variety of other purposes such as fertilizer, food flavoring, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer drugs.|$|E
500|$|Hydrogen {{production}} {{technologies have}} been a significant area of solar chemical research since the 1970s. Aside from electrolysis driven by photovoltaic or photochemical cells, several <b>thermochemical</b> processes have also been explored. One such route uses concentrators to split water into oxygen and hydrogen at high temperatures (...) [...] Another approach uses the heat from solar concentrators to drive the steam reformation of natural gas thereby increasing the overall hydrogen yield compared to conventional reforming methods. <b>Thermochemical</b> cycles characterized by the decomposition and regeneration of reactants present another avenue for hydrogen production.

2500|$|The {{very high}} {{temperature}} reactor concept uses a graphite-moderated core with a once-through uranium fuel cycle, using helium or molten salt as the coolant. This reactor design envisions an outlet temperature of 1,000°C. The reactor core {{can be either}} a prismatic-block or a pebble bed reactor design.

2500|$|While nuclear-generated {{electricity}} {{could be}} used for electrolysis, nuclear heat can be directly applied to split hydrogen from water. [...] High temperature (950–1000°C) gas cooled nuclear reactors have the potential to split hydrogen from water by <b>thermochemical</b> means using nuclear heat. Research into high-temperature nuclear reactors may eventually lead to a hydrogen supply that is cost-competitive with natural gas steam reforming. General Atomics predicts that hydrogen produced in a High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor (HTGR) would cost $1.53/kg. In 2003, steam reforming of natural gas yielded hydrogen at $1.40/kg. In 2005 natural gas prices, hydrogen costs $2.70/kg.|$|E
2500|$|A {{replica of}} Mona Lisa publicized as the [...] "world's smallest" [...] was painted by Andrew Nichols of New Hampshire (USA) in 2011, {{intending}} [...] "to break the record." [...] Recreated at a 70:1 ratio, the miniature Mona Lisa measures approximately 1/4 by 7/16 inches (7 by 11mm). Although his rendition drew media attention, {{it was never}} officially reported whether he had, in fact, broken any existing record. In 2013, a far smaller version of the painting, entitled the Mini Lisa, was created by a Georgia Institute of Technology student named Keith Carroll.

(The term battery refers to the long-life, factory-fabricated core, not to any provision for electrochemical energy conversion.) The fuel is metal or nitride-based containing fertile uranium and transuranics. The LFR is cooled by natural convection with a reactor outlet coolant temperature of 550°C, possibly ranging up to 800°C with advanced materials.

2500|$|It is {{essentially}} a standard VHTR design that uses liquid salt as a coolant in the primary loop, rather than a single helium loop. It relies on [...] "TRISO" [...] fuel dispersed in graphite. Early AHTR research focused on graphite {{would be in the}} form of graphite rods that would be inserted in hexagonal moderating graphite blocks, but current studies focus primarily on pebble-type fuel. The LS-VHTR has many attractive features, including the ability to work at very high temperatures (the boiling point of most molten salt candidates is >1400°C); low-pressure cooling {{that can be used to}} more easily match hydrogen production facility conditions (most <b>thermochemical</b> cycles require temperatures in excess of 750°C); better electric conversion efficiency than a helium-cooled VHTR operating at similar conditions; passive safety systems and better retention of fission products in the event of an accident.
