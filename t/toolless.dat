The process is slower than the two previous methods, but more accurate. The PCB may be fixed, and the wave solder pot moved underneath the PCB; alternately, the PCB may be articulated over a fixed wave or solder bath to undergo the selective-soldering process.

5000|$|The ThinkCentre M52 desktop was {{announced}} in May 2005 following Lenovo's acquisition of IBM's Personal Computing Division. PC World called the M52 desktop, [...] "A corporate machine for the security conscious business user looking for stability and reliability". The M52 desktop was equipped with a 3 GHz Pentium 4 processors, an 80GB hard disk drive, up to 4GB of RAM, eight USB 2.0 ports, two serial ports, a Gigabit Ethernet connection, VGA output, and a chassis that did not require tools to open âˆ’ a <b>toolless</b> chassis.|$|E
5000|$|The P Series {{is based}} on Lenovo's [...] "Flex" [...] system of trays and {{connectors}} {{that are designed to}} enable <b>toolless</b> upgrades. The Flex Bay at the front of each unit can be configured with an optical drive or a variety of options such card readers and FireWire connections. Drives are installed using Flex Bays that come in 2.5-inch and 3.5-inch sizes. Each tray can handle one 3.5-inch drive or two 2.5-inch drives. The Flex Connector is a mezzanine card that links the motherboard via PCIe to SATA, SAS, and RAID devices without using up card slots.|$|E
50|$|When {{installing}} a drive in a bay, {{it is usually}} secured with four screws that hold the drive in the bay, although <b>toolless</b> fasteners are becoming more common. Then, any necessary power, data transfer, and other cables are routed into and connected {{to the rear of}} the drive. The drive bay is usually just big enough for the drive to fit inside. Since computers have 12 V rails on their motherboards, some computer hobbyist websites even sell addons for cigarette lighter receptacles to power or recharge devices made to draw power from automobiles, though USB is already available for charging devices like cell phones and portable media players.|$|E
50|$|In {{a similar}} manner to the AR-15 rifle, that is secured {{together}} with four push pins; the KRISS Vector is split into two major assemblies. Due to the weapon's unusual layout, the lower contains the action, charging handle, magazine well and barrel, while the upper contains the ejection port, rail system, pistol grip and fire control components, {{as well as the}} stock for configurations that have one. This modular design allows for <b>toolless</b> caliber conversions by swapping out only the lower. The Vector's safety is ambidextrous (as well as the fire mode selector on the auto trigger pack) while the ejection port, charging handle, bolt release catch and magazine release are not, and are only available in a right-handed configuration.|$|E

In the footwear industry, lasts are the crucial element for most shoe components such as outsoles or heel caps. Until now, standard lasts have been milled following a handmade last template. This entails digitizing them first and then exporting the complexly generated 3 -D data to a milling machine. The high manufacturing costs have induced many manufacturers to increasingly relocate their last production to countries with low labor costs. The object of a research project, <b>toolless</b> manufacturing employing laminated object manufacturing (LOM) particularly holds promise to significantly improve cost management of customized last production...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSelective Laser Melting (SLM) is an {{additive}} layer manufacturing technology that offers several advantages compared to conven- tional methods of production such as an increased freedom of design and a <b>toolless</b> production suited for variable lot sizes. Despite these attractive aspects today's {{state of the art}} SLM machines lack a holistic process monitoring system that detects and records typical defects during production. A novel sensor concept based on the low coherence interferometry (LCI) was integrated into an SLM production setup. The sensor is mounted coaxially to the processing laser beam and is capable of sampling distances along the optical axis. Measurements during and between the processing of powder layers can reveal crucial topology information which is closely related to the final part quality. The overall potential of the sensor in terms of quality assurance and process control is being discussed. Furthermore fundamental experiments were performed to derive the performance of the system...|$|E

40|$|AbstractImposing {{the trend}} of mass {{customization}} of lightweight construction in industry, conventional manufacturing processes like forming technology and chipping production are pushed to their limits for economical manufacturing. More flexible processes are needed which were developed by the additive manufacturing technology. This <b>toolless</b> production principle offers a high geometrical freedom and an optimized utilization of the used material. Thus load adjusted lightweight components can be produced in small lot sizes in an economical way. To compensate disadvantages like inadequate accuracy and surface roughness hybrid machines combining additive and subtractive manufacturing are developed. Within this paper the principles of mainly used additive manufacturing processes of metals and their possibility to be integrated into a hybrid production machine are summarized. It is pointed out that in particular the integration of deposition processes into a CNC milling center supposes high potential for manufacturing larger parts with high accuracy. Furthermore the combination of additive and subtractive manufacturing allows the production of ready to use products within one single machine. Additionally actual research for the integration of additive manufacturing processes into the production chain will be analyzed. For the long manufacturing time of additive production processes the combination with conventional manufacturing processes like sheet or bulk metal forming seems an effective solution. Especially large volumes can be produced by conventional processes. In an additional production step active elements can be applied by additive manufacturing. This principle is also investigated for tool production to reduce chipping of the high strength material used for forming tools. The aim is the addition of active elements onto a geometrical simple basis by using Laser Metal Deposition. That process allows the utilization of several powder materials during one process what enables the tailoring of the tools materials mechanical properties. Another aspect {{is the possibility of}} Laser Alloying of the tools surface to reduce abrasive and adhesive wear. This technique is especially interesting for tools used in hot stamping production...|$|E
40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} {{offers several}} advantages compared to conventional methods of production, {{such as an}} increased freedom of design and a <b>toolless</b> production suited for variable lot sizes. In particular the printing concept has gained momen- tum for rapid prototyping and manufacturing, since it allows for unprecedented freedom {{in the design of}} novel products, and is not limited by the drawback of powder bed fusion methods, such as selective laser melting. However, nozzle based printing of metals remains challenging, since the melting temperature of most metals is similar to components within the printing nozzle. Therefore, metal printing has been limited to low-melting point metals and metal containing inks, which are generally not optimized for other material properties (e. g. strength, conductivity, and corrosion rate) and cost. Laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT), is a direct-write method allowing for direct deposition {{of a wide range of}} materials including metals like aluminum, chromium, copper, gold, nickel and tungsten. In LIFT of metals, the energy of the laser pulse is absorbed by the metal, resulting in the generation of a thermal stress wave or evaporation of a part of the metal film, which subsequently leads to the ejection of a metal micro-droplet. Subsequently the droplet is deposited on the receiving substrate, on which the product is to be printed. However, the exact ejection mechanisms of these droplets are still under debate. Therefore, this thesis provides a detailed study on the ejection mechanisms during picosecond and nanosecond LIFT of copper and gold. High-speed imaging experiments were performed in order to visualize fluence dependent ejection dynamics and hence to identify and characterize ejection regimes during LIFT. To interpret those ejection regimes, the physical conditions in the metal film were assessed. To that end, the response of the material to the absorbed laser pulse was computed using a numerical two-temperature model. From that, two driving mechanisms, namely laser-induced stress relaxation and the vaporization of the metal film were studied and discussed. It was found that the generated stress distribution is key to the interpretation of the observed ejection dynamics and to the explanation of the ejection fluence threshold. Apart from the ejection dynamics, also the deposition process as well as the production of complex metal parts with dimensions in the micrometer scale were addressed. Hereunto, the presented work provides first studies towards full 3 D printing capabilities demonstrated by the manufacturing of high-aspect ratio pillars of copper and gold. In addition to the printing of liquid phase metal droplets, also the transfer of thin metal films in solid phase was studied. To this end, an advanced LIFT setup was developed and successfully employed to demonstrate the solid phase transfer of thin films...|$|E
