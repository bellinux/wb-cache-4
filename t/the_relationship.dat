30|$|To summarize, first, {{regardless}} of <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> between KIC and organizational effectiveness or <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> between KIC and organizational commitment, no significant effects were found. <b>The</b> <b>relationships</b> between KPC and organizational effectiveness and <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> between KPC and organizational commitment have significant effects. Meanwhile, KPC, through organizational commitment, positively influences organizational effectiveness. Our findings confirm that KMC is not solely sufficient to drive organizational effectiveness and that organizations {{also need to}} encourage organizational commitment.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Software {{development}} {{processes are}} distinct for different purposes, organizations, product families, projects, etc. Thus, {{there is a}} need for customizable means for automation of them. Furthermore, the semantics of the developed artifacts (models), as well as <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> within and among them are specified individually for each process. Therefore, the ability to provide automation for a software development process requires clear understanding of <b>the</b> possible <b>relationships</b> among <b>the</b> entities (models, elements, etc.) within <b>the</b> process. <b>The</b> <b>relationships</b> suggest dependencies among the entities, and further, the dependencies imply functionality, i. e. possibilities for automation. In this paper we study the nature of <b>the</b> <b>relationships,</b> and their implications, from the viewpoint of tool support for software development. As an example process model, we study OMT++, and consider <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> among different entities at different levels of the process. We conclude that most of <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> are partial, complex, and imply basically arbitrary functionality. On the other hand, customizability of the processes requires flexible ways to define <b>the</b> <b>relationships,</b> as well as the implied functionality. We also briefly discuss the possibilities of specifying <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> and providing <b>the</b> functionality in a flexible way. ...|$|R

The standard hypothesis states that the ancestor of the eukaryotes diverged early from the Archaea, and that eukaryotes arose through fusion of an archaean and eubacterium, which became the nucleus and cytoplasm; this explains various genetic similarities but runs into difficulties explaining cell structure. An alternative hypothesis, the eocyte hypothesis, posits that Eukaryota emerged relatively late from the Archaea.|$|E

5|$|Grand Forks has {{an active}} sister city program {{designed}} to encourage cultural and economic exchanges. Grand Forks' first sister city was Ishim in the Soviet Union. <b>The</b> <b>relationship</b> with the Siberian city formally began in 1984 during the Cold War. Sometime in the late 1990s, however, political and economic turmoil in Russia ended <b>the</b> <b>relationship.</b> While <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> with Ishim faded, Grand Forks found a new sister in Awano, Japan. An informal relationship began in 1994 when the school districts of both cities began exchanging students. In 1998, the two formally proclaimed themselves sister cities. The most concrete evidence of <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> {{between the two is}} a Japanese rock garden in Grand Forks' Sertoma Park and a sculpture of an American bison in an Awano park. However, the annexation of Awano by the larger city of Kanuma has led {{to the end of the}} sister city relationship. Grand Forks' relationship with Dickinson, North Dakota, began in 2002, when delegations from each city visited the other. Grand Forks Mayor Michael Brown has said he thinks having friends in western North Dakota, which typically has diverging interests from eastern cities, could help at the state legislature. Sarpsborg, Norway, became a sister city in 2005 following several exchanges among leaders from both cities. The city became interested in building a relationship with Sarpsborg because many Grand Forks residents have Norwegian heritage.|$|E

40|$|Extant tools {{supporting}} OMT(Object Modeling Technique) have {{a serious}} drawback that they fail to capture a lot of relationships inherently existing among design objects.
