5|$|Daniel Jacob Radcliffe (born 23 July 1989) is an English actor {{best known}} for his role as Harry Potter in the film series of the same name. He made his acting debut at 10 years of age in BBC One's 1999 {{television}} film David Copperfield, followed by his cinematic debut in 2001's <b>The</b> <b>Tailor</b> of Panama. At age 11, he was cast as Harry Potter in the first Harry Potter film, and starred in the series for 10 years until the release of the eighth and final film in 2011.|$|E
5|$|The film starred Roekiah, Rd Djoemala, Kartolo, and Annie Landouw and {{featured}} Titing, Ismail, and Ramli. Roekiah had regularly been paired on-screen with Rd. Mochtar– {{despite being}} married to Kartolo– beginning with Terang Boelan. In 1938 the three had come to Tan's, where they acted together in three films beginning with Fatima. However, after a wage dispute following Siti Akbari (1940), Mochtar left the company. To replace him, Tan's hired <b>the</b> <b>tailor</b> Djoemala as Roekiah's romantic foil. Sorga Ka Toedjoe was their first film together.|$|E

In 1896, he became a foundation member of <b>the</b> Perth <b>Tailors</b> Society and later held various offices within the organisation, including treasurer, vice-president and president, as it morphed into <b>the</b> <b>Tailors</b> Union and eventually <b>the</b> Amalgamated <b>Tailors</b> and Tailoresses Union.|$|R

5|$|The tale was {{published}} in a larger size than Potter's previous books, but was reduced in the 1930s to bring it into line with the other books in the Peter Rabbit series. It was given its present title at that time. Potter declared the tale her next favourite to <b>The</b> <b>Tailor</b> of Gloucester. Beswick Pottery released porcelain figurines of the tale's characters through {{the latter half of}} the 20th century, and Schmid & Co. released a music box in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|When {{the train}} crossed into Poland, he tells them, {{it was taken}} over by the Gestapo, the German secret police. The Jews were {{transferred}} to trucks, then driven to a forest in Galicia, near Kolomaye, where they were forced to dig pits. When they had finished, each prisoner had to approach the hole, present his neck, and was shot. Babies were thrown into the air and used as targets by machine gunners. He tells them about Malka, the young girl who took three days to die, and Tobias, <b>the</b> <b>tailor</b> who begged to be killed before his sons; and how he, Moshe, was shot in the leg and taken for dead. But the Jews of Sighet would not listen, making Moshe Night's first unheeded witness.|$|E
5|$|Potter biographer Linda Lear {{notes that}} none of the rabbit books {{subsequent}} to Peter Rabbit appealed to Potter with the passion she experienced for the original, but, in Benjamin Bunny, she successfully wrote a simple, didactic tale for very young children that was less complicated than The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin and <b>The</b> <b>Tailor</b> of Gloucester. Benjamin Bunny however lacked the vitality of her previous efforts because it was made to order rather than allowed to flower from a picture letter to real children in the manner of Peter Rabbit and Squirrel Nutkin. The weak story line of Benjamin Bunny is evidence of her dwindling interest in continuing the Peter Rabbit saga, but the book displays a delight in place, a deep understanding of rabbit anatomy and behaviour, and beautifully miniaturized illustrations of vegetable gardens. Benjamin Bunny presented demands upon Potter she had not encountered in her previous three tales. She had depleted all her sketchbook backgrounds in the production of the other tales and was forced to create new ones, but the greatest challenge to Potter's artistry was consciously working to satisfy both her publisher's demand for another commercial success and her public's expectation of a tale as delightful as her others while labouring under the pressure to produce a sequel to a work of genius.|$|E

The ontology is made up of three layers that represent: a) the process characteristics extracted through the analysis of an international standard, b) <b>the</b> <b>tailoring</b> of this standard made at the corporate level, and c) a final tailoring done in response to clientspecific, project-based requirements. <b>The</b> <b>tailoring</b> extends and refines the elements defined on the upper levels to support the customization of tasks and work products for different projects. The resulting ontology supports <b>the</b> <b>tailoring</b> of <b>the</b> process definitions and can also be used as an indexing tool for the easy identification of the requirements and constraints that {{have an impact on the}} elaboration of work products and on the planning, execution and monitoring of project activities...|$|R

25|$|In 1942 Eric Cross' book <b>The</b> <b>Tailor</b> and Ansty {{was banned}} by the Board. The book was a {{collection}} of stories and sayings from an old country tailor called Timothy Buckley and his wife Anastasia that the author had recorded.
