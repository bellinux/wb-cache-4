[...] Spezza, asked {{to comment on}} the experience of having Orr as an agent, replied: [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> true feeling for how great he is. I have so much respect for him. I watch him on tapes and it's just ridiculous how good he was compared to the guys he was playing against. He's a great guy and you don't even know it's Bobby Orr, the way he talks to you." ...|$|E
500|$|Some of Landy's {{patients}} included Alice Cooper, Richard Harris, Rod Steiger, and Gig Young, {{who died}} in an apparent murder-suicide {{along with his wife}} in 1978. In a 1976 interview with Rolling Stone, Landy claimed that he had treated others, but that he was in no position to explain his background. He added, [...] "I've treated a tremendous number of people in show business; for some reason I {{seem to be able to}} relate to them. I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> nice reputation that says I'm unorthodox by orthodox standards but basically unique by unorthodox standards." [...] Unusually, he had his own press kit. Doctor and former colleague Solon D. Samuels described Landy as [...] "a maverick in the field of psychology. He's done things that no other psychologist has done in treating the psychotic and the drug addict.... What he was doing really was translating the hospital environment to the home environment. I think he got some remarkable results – with people who can afford it." ...|$|E
500|$|Hughes won the grudge {{match against}} Serra at UFC 98: Evans vs. Machida via {{unanimous}} decision. In the first round, both fighters collided heads, and Hughes got {{the worst of}} it. Despite this, Serra could not finish the fight and Hughes recovered rapidly. In the second stanza, Hughes controlled his opponent {{on the ground with}} his wrestling skills. The final round saw the former champions taking each other down and exchanging punches. The back and forth action rewarded both competitors with Fight of the Night honors. After the fight Hughes and Serra embraced each other and ended their feud. Hughes posted on his blog: [...] "When the fight was over, I was pretty confident I was going to get my hand raised. Some people have asked why I raised his hand at the end. Actually I didn't, he raised mine. He also told me that, no matter what the decision was, he was done with the rivalry". After the fight Hughes said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> few more fights left in me." ...|$|E

500|$|Just {{like the}} text—which was mostly written {{on top of}} {{photographs}}—the photographs on the book are highly sexual and depict nudity, [...] simulations of sexual acts, bondage, homosexuality and analingus, with accessories such as knives, whips, masks and chains; however, full intercourse is never shown. Aside from unknown models, featured in the book are actress Isabella Rossellini, rappers Big Daddy Kane and Madonna's then boyfriend Vanilla Ice, model Naomi Campbell, gay porn star Joey Stefano, actor Udo Kier, socialite Tatiana von Fürstenberg, and nightclub owner Ingrid Casares; however the heterosexual photos in the book involve only Madonna and Vanilla Ice. Madonna herself is featured partially or completely naked. One of the book's most famous photographs shows Madonna hitchhiking completely naked in Miami. The book also reflects a great part on Dita's perspective towards her own sexuality. Dita writes in Sex that her [...] "pussy" [...] is a temple of learning and that exposing it, is really a homage to it ("It's hard to describe it smells like a baby to me fresh and full of life. I love my pussy, it is the complete summation of my life"). Sex contains statements like [...] "ass fucking is the most pleasurable way to get fucked and it hurts the most too". Others include [...] "here is something comforting about being tied up. Like {{when you were a}} baby and your mother strapped you in the car seat. She wanted you to be safe. It was an act of love" [...] and [...] "I wouldn't want a penis. It would be like having a third leg. it seems like a contraption that would get in the way. I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> dick in my brain". In Sex, Dita also pointed out that [...] "A lot of people are afraid to say what they want. That's why they don't get what they want". The book includes Madonna's perspective on pornography: ...|$|E

2500|$|These Republican {{leaders have}} not been content with attacks on me, or my wife, or on my sons. No, not content with that, they now include my little dog, Fala. [...] Well, of course, I don't resent attacks, and my family don't resent attacks, but Fala does resent them. You know, Fala is Scotch, and being a Scottie, {{as soon as he}} learned that the Republican fiction writers in Congress and out had concocted a story that I'd left him behind on an Aleutian island and had sent a {{destroyer}} back to find him—at a cost to the taxpayers of two or three, or eight or twenty million dollars—his Scotch soul was furious. He has not been the same dog since. I am accustomed to hearing malicious falsehoods about myself ... But I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> right to resent, to object, to libelous statements about my dog.|$|E
2500|$|Although the March 2007 {{issue of}} Foreign Policy listed BJU {{as one of}} [...] "The World's Most Controversial Religious Sites" [...] because of its past {{influence}} on American politics, BJU has seen little political controversy since Stephen Jones became president. When asked by a Newsweek reporter if he wished to play a political role, Stephen Jones replied, [...] "It would not be my choice." [...] Further, {{when asked if he}} felt ideologically closer to his father's engagement with politics or to other evangelicals who have tried to avoid civic involvement, he answered, [...] "The gospel is for individuals. The main message we have is to individuals. We’re not here to save the culture." [...] In a 2005 Washington Post interview, Jones dodged political questions and even admitted that he was embarrassed by [...] "some of the more vitriolic comments" [...] made by his predecessors. [...] "I don't want to get specific," [...] he said, [...] "But there were things said back then that I wouldn't say today." [...] In October 2007 when Bob Jones III, as [...] "a private citizen," [...] endorsed Mitt Romney for the Republican nomination for president, Stephen Jones {{made it clear that he}} wished [...] "to stay out of politics" [...] and that neither he nor the university had endorsed anyone. Despite a hotly contested South Carolina primary, none of the candidates appeared on the platform of BJU's Founders' Memorial Amphitorium during the 2008 election cycle. In April 2008 Stephen Jones told a reporter, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> political bone in my body." ...|$|E
2500|$|When songwriter/producer Kashif {{accepted}} Arista president Clive Davis' {{invitation to}} see a New York club performance by a young singer named Whitney Houston that he'd just signed to the label, he was disappointed. Her act was a lounge act and didn't appeal to Kashif. Davis continued to court Kashif sending him a videotape of Houston's performance on The Merv Griffin Show. La La, a writer signed to Kashif's music publishing company, sent him a demo of a ballad she had written titled [...] "You Give Good Love." [...] She'd sent it to her idol Roberta Flack first but she was rebuffed by her assistant with an angry [...] "don't call us, we'll call you" [...] retort. When Kashif heard the song, a light bulb came out in his mind that flashed [...] "hit! hit!" [...] Then he called Gerry Griffith, an Arista A man, and said that [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> song for you." [...] So Griffith and Houston drove to the New Jersey studio where Kashif was working to check it out. Griffith recalled {{that there was a}} demo of the song but La La wanted to sing it live with her piano playing. After La La finished the song, Griffith said [...] "that's the song – that's what I've been looking for." [...] It was the kind of tune that had the emotion that she could get into and sing her heart out. The release of [...] "You Give Good Love" [...] was designed to give Houston a noticeable position and standing within the black music charts. Clive Davis later explained the thinking behind releasing the song as the debut single from the album: ...|$|E
