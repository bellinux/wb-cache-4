5000|$|Reheat, {{wherein the}} working fluid - {{in most cases}} air - expands {{through a series of}} turbines, then is passed through a second {{combustion}} chamber before expanding to ambient pressure through a final set of turbines, has the advantage of increasing the power output possible for a given compression ratio without exceeding any metallurgical constraints (typically about 1000°C). The use of an afterburner for jet aircraft engines can also be referred to as [...] "reheat"; it is a different process in that the reheated air is expanded through a <b>thrust</b> <b>nozzle</b> rather than a turbine. The metallurgical constraints are somewhat alleviated, enabling much higher reheat temperatures (about 2000°C). Reheat is most often used to improve the specific power (per throughput of air), and is usually associated with a drop in efficiency; this effect is especially pronounced in afterburners due to the extreme amounts of extra fuel used.|$|E
5000|$|A further engine {{problem was}} that of uncommanded opening of the {{variable}} <b>thrust</b> <b>nozzle</b> (usually through loss of engine oil pressure, as the nozzles were actuated using engine oil as hydraulic fluid); although the engine would be running normally at high power, {{the opening of the}} nozzle resulted in a drastic loss of thrust. A modification program installed a manual nozzle closure control which reduced the problem. The engine was also known to suffer from afterburner blowout on takeoff, or even non-ignition, resulting in a major loss of thrust that could be detected by the pilot - the recommended action was to abandon the takeoff. The first fatal accident in German service was caused by this phenomenon. Some aircrews experienced uncommanded [...] "stick kicker" [...] activation at low level when flying straight and level, so F-104 crews often flew with the system deactivated. Asymmetric flap deployment was another common cause of accidents, as was a persistent problem with severe nose wheel [...] "shimmy" [...] on landing that usually resulted in the aircraft leaving the runway and in some cases even flipping over onto its back.|$|E

40|$|An {{implicit}} {{finite volume}} method is investigated for {{the solution of}} the compressible Navier-Stokes equations for flows within thrust reversing and <b>thrust</b> vectoring <b>nozzles.</b> <b>Thrust</b> reversing <b>nozzles</b> typically have sharp corners, and the rapid expansion and large turning angles near these corners are shown to cause unacceptable time step restrictions when conventional approximate factorization methods are used. In this investigation these limitations are overcome by using second-order upwind differencing and line Gauss-Siedel relaxation. This method is implemented with a zonal mesh so that flows through complex nozzle geometries may be efficiently calculated. Results are presented for five nozzle configurations including two with time varying geometries.

40|$|The {{creation}} of a computer module {{used to calculate the}} size of the horizontal control surfaces of a conceptual aircraft design is discussed. The control surface size is determined by first calculating the size needed to rotate the aircraft during takeoff, and, second, by determining if the calculated size is large enough to maintain stability of the aircraft throughout any specified mission. The tail size needed to rotate during takeoff is calculated from a summation of forces about the main landing gear of the aircraft. The stability of the aircraft is determined from a summation of forces about the center of gravity during different phases of the aircraft's flight. Included in the horizontal control surface analysis are: downwash effects on an aft tail, upwash effects on a forward canard, and effects due to flight in close proximity to the ground. Comparisons of production aircraft with numerical models show good accuracy for control surface sizing. A modified canard design verified the accuracy of the module for canard configurations. Added to this stability and control module is a subroutine that determines one of the three design variables, for a stable vectored thrust aircraft. These include forward <b>thrust</b> <b>nozzle</b> position, aft <b>thrust</b> <b>nozzle</b> angle, and forward thrust split...|$|E
