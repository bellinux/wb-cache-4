5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} roams Pacific City, {{systematically}} eliminating the leaders and subordinates {{of the three}} gangs. Upon defeating the gangs' Kingpins and generals, the Agent must put down a final riot by the remaining gang members in the area which after completion will cause that city to be almost crime free. Once all three gangs are fully exterminated, in the closing cutscene of the game, the Director reveals to the Agent {{that there was an}} ulterior motive for the Agency's actions: the Agency had secretly empowered the three gangs in the first place to instill fear in Pacific City's residents, thus creating a need for the Agency to control the city, and acceptance in the populace when they did take over. The Agency Director's comments suggest that <b>the</b> <b>Agency</b> <b>will</b> replicate this plan in other cities across the globe to create a New World Order.|$|E

25|$|Threat {{and risk}} {{assessments}} are {{widely recognized as}} valuable decision-making tools when setting examination priorities. The Agency's intelligence directorate conducts a border risk assessment of its border operations every 2â€“3 years. Under this process, the Agency assesses the risks of smuggling contraband, such as drugs, firearms, proceeds of crime, child pornography, illicit tobacco etc. The information is assessed and ranked by commodity and by mode of transport. <b>The</b> <b>Agency</b> <b>will</b> include the risks of irregular or illegal migration of people, {{and the movement of}} food, plants, and animals, now under the Agency's broader mandate, in the next version of its border risk assessment.|$|E

25|$|The Reconstruction Agency was {{established}} to replace the Reconstruction Headquarters {{in response to the}} Great East Japan earthquake, created on June 24, 2011. The Reconstruction Agency is headed by the Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda. Noda was named direct head of the agency in an effort to strengthen the leadership of the organization. Tatsuo Hirano, a native of Iwate Prefecture, served as the agency's first Minister of State for Disaster Management until he was replaced by Osamu Fujimura on June 4, 2012. The Reconstruction Agency is not a Cabinet Office, but will have authority over other government ministries. <b>The</b> <b>agency</b> <b>will</b> exist for ten years, the length of time estimated to fully restore the region after the disaster, and be dissolved on March 3, 2021. A wooden tablet for the new agency was made from materials from the earthquake zone. Prime Minister Noda placed the tablet at the Akasaka Agency headquarters as a reminder of the responsibility to residents of the disaster-hit regions.|$|E
500|$|On August 2, 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit {{issued its}} ruling on the Hours of Service {{litigation}} {{brought by the}} American Trucking Associations and Public Citizen.

While the decision does not officially take effect until the mandate is issued 52 days after the decision (unless a party files a petition for rehearing, either by the panel or en banc, or moves to stay the mandate pending the filing of a petition for certiorari in the Supreme Court), FMCSA announces <b>the</b> <b>Agency</b> <b>will</b> immediately cease enforcement of the 30-minute rest break provision of the HOS rule against short-haul operations.|$|E

50|$|Until {{recently}} {{almost all}} of <b>the</b> central government <b>agencies</b> were located in either Seoul or Gwacheon government complex, {{with the exception of}} a few agencies located in Daejeon government complex. Considering that Gwacheon is a city constructed just outside Seoul to house the new government complex, virtually all administrative functions of South Korea were concentrated in Seoul. It has been recently decided, however, that the majority of <b>the</b> government <b>agencies</b> relocate themselves to Sejong Special Self-Governing City established in South Chungcheong Province so that <b>the</b> government <b>agencies</b> are better accessible from most parts of South Korea and at the same time the concentration into Seoul might be deterred. So far only the first phase of the project has been finished and <b>the</b> selected <b>agencies</b> <b>will</b> move one by one to the new government complex in Sejong City during the next few years. Here is a brief description of where <b>the</b> <b>agencies</b> <b>will</b> settle when <b>the</b> project is finished.|$|R
