5|$|The next day, {{they learn}} {{that the members of}} the Sanders-Hardiman {{expedition}} are falling into comas, with fragments of a shattered crystal ball found near each victim. Concerned, Tintin, Haddock, and their friend Professor Calculus visit Calculus's old friend Professor Hercules <b>Tarragon,</b> the only expedition member yet to be affected. Professor <b>Tarragon</b> is under police guard, and he shows his visitors the mummified body of Inca king Rascar Capac, which the expedition brought back with them from Peru. A lightning storm strikes the house and sends ball lightning down the chimney and onto the mummy—which evaporates. Worried, <b>Tarragon</b> states that this reflects the culmination of Capac's prophecy, which declares that punishment will descend upon those who desecrate his tomb. Spending the stormy night at Tarragon's house, Tintin, Haddock, and Calculus are each awoken by a dream involving Capac's mummy. They find <b>Tarragon</b> comatose in his bed, with the accompanying crystal shards nearby; the attacker had bypassed the guards by climbing in via the chimney. The next day, Calculus is walking on the grounds of Tarragon's house when he discovers one of the mummy's bracelets, which he places on himself.|$|E
5|$|Beurre Maître d'Hôtel {{is used as}} an {{ingredient}} in Chateaubriand sauce, which is sometimes used {{in the preparation of}} Chateaubriand steak. The butter is used in the last stage of the sauce's preparation, whereby after the sauce is strained, it is finished with Beurre Maître d'Hôtel. Chopped <b>tarragon</b> may also be added to the sauce during this last preparation stage.|$|E
5|$|The museum's director, Professor Capart, {{exhibited}} similarities with Professor <b>Tarragon,</b> a new {{character that}} Hergé had {{developed for the}} story. He also included a number of characters who had previously appeared in earlier adventures, among them Professor Cantonneau from The Shooting Star, General Alcazar from The Broken Ear, and Bianca Castafiore from King Ottokar's Sceptre.|$|E
5|$|Tintin and Haddock later realise that Calculus {{has gone}} missing, and surmise {{that he has}} been kidnapped by the same {{individual}} who placed <b>Tarragon</b> in a coma. The police set up road blocks, but the kidnappers switch cars and are able to evade them. Tintin visits a hospital where the seven stricken members of the Sanders-Hardiman expedition are housed; he is astonished that at a precise time of day, all awaken and scream about figures attacking them before slipping back into their comas. Haddock is dejected by Calculus' abduction, but upon learning that police have spotted the kidnapper's car at a port, he and Tintin race there, believing that the abductors seek to board a boat with Calculus and take him abroad. At the docks, they spot Alcazar boarding a ship to South America; he reveals that Chiquito has disappeared and {{that he was one of}} the last descendants of the Inca, with Tintin surmising that Chiquito must be one of Calculus' captors.|$|E
5|$|The Provence and Côte d'Azur {{region is}} rich in quality citrus, vegetables, fruits, and herbs; the region {{is one of the}} largest {{suppliers}} of all these ingredients in France. The region also produces the largest amount of olives, and creates superb olive oil. Lavender is used in many dishes found in Haute Provence. Other important herbs in the cuisine include thyme, sage, rosemary, basil, savory, fennel, marjoram, <b>tarragon,</b> oregano, and bay leaf. Honey is a prized ingredient in the region. Seafood proliferates throughout the coastal area and is heavily represented in the cuisine. Goat cheeses, air-dried sausages, lamb, beef, and chicken are popular here. Garlic* and anchovies are used in many of the region's sauces, as in Poulet Provençal, which uses white wine, tomatoes, herbs, and sometimes anchovies, and Pastis is found everywhere that alcohol is served. The cuisine uses a large amount of vegetables for lighter preparations. Truffles are commonly seen in Provence during the winter. Thirteen desserts in Provence are the traditional Christmas dessert, e.g. quince cheese, biscuits, almonds, nougat, apple, and fougasse.|$|E
25|$|Sauce Paloise is {{a version}} of béarnaise with mint {{substituted}} for <b>tarragon.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sauce Choron is a {{variation}} of béarnaise without <b>tarragon</b> or chervil, plus added tomato purée.|$|E
25|$|Mayonnaise is {{the base}} for many other chilled sauces and salad dressings. For example, sauce rémoulade, in classic French cuisine, is {{mayonnaise}} to which has been added mustard, gherkins, capers, parsley, chervil, <b>tarragon,</b> and possibly anchovy essence.|$|E
25|$|Theatre PANIK staged {{the play}} at <b>Tarragon</b> Theatre in Toronto, opening May 29, 2008 with Bethany Jillard {{performing}} the role. All four local daily papers gave {{the play and}} the actress enthusiastic reviews, but the theatre critic Lynn Slotkin in CBC Toronto radio show Here and Now was highly critical of {{every aspect of the}} play.|$|E
25|$|D. ambrosioides {{is used as}} a leaf vegetable, herb, and {{herbal tea}} for its pungent flavor. Raw, it has a resinous, {{medicinal}} pungency, similar to oregano, anise, fennel, or even <b>tarragon,</b> but stronger. The fragrance of D. ambrosioides is strong but difficult to describe. A common analogy is to turpentine or creosote. It has also been compared to citrus, savory, and mint.|$|E
25|$|Tintin, Haddock, and Tournesol go to {{the home}} of Professor Hippolyte Bergamotte (Hercules <b>Tarragon)</b> to protect him, as he and Tournesol were {{students}} together. The police detectives Dupont and Dupond (Thomson and Thompson) have also been sent to protect Bergamotte. Bergamotte reveals the mummy of Rascar Capac, and Tintin reads the prophecy that the expedition found in his tomb. A storm comes, a ball of lightning comes down the chimney, destroys the mummy, and Bergamotte realises that the prophecy is true. He is then struck down by the curse like the others.|$|E
25|$|There are {{typically}} {{two types of}} vegetables in okroshka. The first must have a neutral taste, such as boiled potatoes, turnips, rutabagas, carrots, or fresh cucumbers. The second must be spicy, consisting of mainly green onion {{as well as other}} herbs—greens of dill, parsley, chervil, celery, or <b>tarragon.</b> Different meat and poultry can be used in the same soup. The most common ingredient is beef alone or with poultry. If it is made with fish, the best choice would be tench, European perch, pike-perch, cod, or other neutral-tasting fish.|$|E
25|$|Arnett briefly {{attended}} Lakefield College School in Lakefield, Ontario, but {{was asked}} not to return after a semester for being a troublemaker. The Subway Academy II allowed him to take theatre classes at the <b>Tarragon</b> Theatre. He eventually graduated from Leaside High School and attended Concordia University, Montreal for one semester, but dropped out. As a teenager, he was encouraged by his mother to pursue an acting career. He auditioned for commercials in Toronto and enjoyed acting. In 1990, he moved to New York City to study acting at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute. He appeared in plays in New York and his first acting role was in Felicity Huffman's independent film Erie, which was filmed on the Erie Canal.|$|E
25|$|Chives have a {{wide variety}} of culinary uses, such as in {{traditional}} dishes in France, Sweden, and elsewhere. In his 1806 book Attempt at a Flora (Försök til en flora), Retzius describes how chives are used with pancakes, soups, fish, and sandwiches. They are also an ingredient of the gräddfil sauce with the traditional herring dish served at Swedish midsummer celebrations. The flowers may also be used to garnish dishes. In Poland and Germany, chives are served with quark cheese. Chives are one of the fines herbes of French cuisine, the others being <b>tarragon,</b> chervil and parsley. Chives can be found fresh at most markets year-round, making them readily available; they can also be dry-frozen without much impairment to the taste, giving home growers the opportunity to store large quantities harvested from their own gardens.|$|E
500|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{praised the}} {{character}} of <b>Tarragon,</b> stating that he exudes a presence [...] "far beyond what we might expect from a novelist, let alone a cartoonist". He then compared the scenario in which <b>Tarragon</b> was trapped within his home to that in The Calculus Affair in which Professor Topolino was tied up in his house. He also identified elements within the story that he believed reflected recurring themes within The Adventures of Tintin. He argued that {{the way in which}} Alcazar was presented as Tintin's friend in this story was a manifestation of the recurring theme of friendship. He thought that the appearance of Rascar Capac's jewels reflected Hergé's use of jewels as a theme throughout the series, while the mummy's removal from its tomb was a manifestation of the recurring concept of the tomb.|$|E
500|$|Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier {{believed}} that the two-story arc represents [...] "one more leap forward in Hergé's graphic and narrative skills" [...] {{as a result of}} the transition to full colour double pages as the initial means of publication. They noted that The Seven Crystal Balls is [...] "bathed in the surreal atmosphere that Hergé knew how to create so well", with Tintin confronting [...] "a dark and oppressive force" [...] that was [...] "worthy of a Hammer film." [...] They asserted that the character of Professor <b>Tarragon</b> was [...] "to archaeology what Haddock is to the sea", adding that Mark Falconer (Marc Chalet) resembled an older Tintin with darker hair. Ultimately, they awarded both halves of the story arc five out of five.|$|E

2500|$|Like Hollandaise sauce, {{there are}} several methods for the {{preparation}} of Béarnaise sauce. The most common preparation is a bain-marie method where a reduction of vinegar is used to acidulate the yolks. Escoffier calls for a reduction of wine, vinegar, shallots, fresh chervil, fresh <b>tarragon</b> and crushed peppercorns (later strained out), with fresh <b>tarragon</b> and chervil to finish instead of lemon juice. [...] Others are similar. [...] Alternatively, the flavorings may be added to a finished Hollandaise (sans lemon juice). Joy of Cooking describes a blender preparation with the same ingredients. [...] A faux Béarnaise can be produced by adding capers and <b>tarragon</b> to a Hollandaise.|$|E
2500|$|Sauce Choron or Sauce Béarnaise Tomatée is a {{variation}} of béarnaise without <b>tarragon</b> or chervil, plus added tomato purée. [...] It is named after Alexandre Étienne Choron.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} {{derivative}} is Sauce Béarnaise. [...] It {{can be produced}} by replacing the acidifying agent (vinegar reduction or lemon juice) in a preparation with a strained reduction of vinegar, shallots, fresh chervil, fresh <b>tarragon</b> and (if to taste) crushed peppercorns. Alternatively, the flavorings may be added to a standard hollandaise. Béarnaise and its children are often used on steak or other [...] "assertive" [...] grilled meats and fish.|$|E
2500|$|Europa 2 {{has seven}} restaurants. [...] All offer gourmet dining and {{a choice of}} 600 wines. [...] According to one source, [...] "On a normal night, 120 {{different}} dishes are served à la carte in the ship’s restaurants. Fifty-six cooks serve up to 500 passengers..." [...] The largest of the restaurants, Weltmeere, serves an international range of dishes. The other six include <b>Tarragon,</b> which is French-based; Elements, with an Asian theme; Serenissima, which serves Italian fare; and Sakura, a sushi restaurant. German cuisine {{is not a major}} feature.|$|E
2500|$|The book {{claims that}} 71 percent of bacon is still {{consumed}} at breakfast or brunch. It includes 10 recipes {{for the early}} in the day meals and then covers appetizers, sandwiches, entrees and a few desserts, such as a savory bread pudding with Canadian bacon, multigrain bread, feta cheese, <b>tarragon</b> and wild mushrooms [...] "for a sophisticated combination that would be welcome at any meal." [...] In the section on how to cook bacon, Pruess wrote that she prefers to oven-fry large batches in jellyroll pan, in a 400-degree oven for 11 to 16 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|Take three spoonfuls of Allemande, six ditto of aspic, {{and two of}} oil. Add {{a little}} <b>tarragon</b> vinegar, that has not boiled, some pepper and salt, and minced ravigotte, or merely some parsley. Then put in the members of fowl, or fillets of soles, [...] Your {{mayonnaise}} must be put to ice; neither are you to put the members into your sauce till it begins to freeze. Next dish your meat or fish, mask with the sauce before it be quite frozen, and garnish your dish with whatever you think proper, as beet root, jelly, nasturtiums, ...|$|E
2500|$|Béarnaise sauce ( [...] ; [...] ) is a sauce made of {{clarified}} butter emulsified in egg yolks and {{white wine vinegar}} and flavored with herbs. [...] It {{is considered to be}} a [...] "child" [...] of the mother Hollandaise sauce, one of the five mother sauces in the French haute cuisine repertoire. The difference is only in the flavoring: Béarnaise uses shallot, chervil, peppercorns, gherkin and <b>tarragon</b> in a reduction of vinegar and wine, while Hollandaise is more stripped down, using a reduction of lemon juice or white wine and peppercorns. (One means of preparing Béarnaise, see below, is to start with Hollandaise and add the other ingredients.) Its name is related to the province of Béarn, France.|$|E
50|$|A better {{substitute}} for French <b>tarragon</b> is Spanish <b>tarragon</b> (Tagetes lucida), {{also known as}} Mexican mint marigold, Mexican <b>tarragon,</b> Texas <b>tarragon,</b> or winter <b>tarragon.</b> It is much more reminiscent of French <b>tarragon,</b> {{with a hint of}} anise. Although not in the same genus as the other tarragons, Spanish <b>tarragon</b> has a stronger flavor than Russian <b>tarragon</b> that does not diminish significantly with age.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tarragon</b> {{is one of}} {{the four}} fines herbes of French cooking, and is {{particularly}} suitable for chicken, fish, and egg dishes. <b>Tarragon</b> is the main flavoring component of Béarnaise sauce. Fresh, lightly bruised sprigs of <b>tarragon</b> are steeped in vinegar to produce <b>tarragon</b> vinegar.|$|E
50|$|Tagetes lucida Cav. is a {{perennial}} plant native to Mexico and Central America. It {{is used as}} a medicinal plant and as a culinary herb. The leaves have a tarragon-like flavor, with hints of anise, and it has entered the nursery trade in North America as a <b>tarragon</b> substitute. Common names include sweetscented marigold, Mexican marigold, Mexican mint marigold, Mexican <b>tarragon,</b> Spanish <b>tarragon,</b> sweet mace, Texas <b>tarragon,</b> pericón, yerbaniz, and hierbanís.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tarragon</b> {{grows to}} 120 - 150 cm tall, with slender {{branched}} stems. The leaves are lanceolate, 2 - 8 cm long and 2-10 mm broad, glossy green, with an entire margin. The flowers are produced in small capitulae 2-4 mm diameter, each capitulum containing up to 40 yellow or greenish-yellow florets. French <b>tarragon,</b> however, seldom produces any flowers (or seeds). Some <b>tarragon</b> plants produce seeds that are generally only sterile. Others produce viable seeds. <b>Tarragon</b> has rhizomatous roots that it uses to spread and readily reproduce.|$|E
50|$|In Slovenia, <b>tarragon</b> {{is used in}} a {{variation}} of the traditional nut roll sweet cake, called potica. In Hungary a popular kind of chicken soup is flavored with <b>tarragon.</b>|$|E
50|$|Named for the herb, the <b>Tarragon</b> was {{developed}} from the Millennium Master after the manufacturer of that design went bankrupt. The <b>Tarragon</b> has been developed by Pelegrin in conjunction with CFM Air.|$|E
50|$|Russian <b>tarragon</b> (A. dracunculoides L.) can {{be grown}} from seed but is much weaker in flavor when {{compared}} to the French variety. However, Russian <b>tarragon</b> is a far more hardy and vigorous plant, spreading at the roots and growing over a meter tall. This <b>tarragon</b> actually prefers poor soils and happily tolerates drought and neglect. It is not as strongly aromatic and flavorsome as its French cousin, but it produces many more leaves from early spring onwards that are mild and good in salads and cooked food. Russian <b>tarragon</b> loses what flavor it has as it ages and is widely considered useless as a culinary herb, though it is sometimes used in crafts. The young stems in early spring can be cooked as an asparagus substitute. Horticulturists recommend that Russian <b>tarragon</b> be grown indoors from seed and planted out in the summer. The spreading plants can be divided easily.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tarragon</b> {{is used to}} flavor {{a popular}} carbonated soft drink in the {{countries}} of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and, by extension, Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. The drink, named Tarhun ( [...] ), {{is made out of}} sugary <b>tarragon</b> concentrate and colored bright green.|$|E
50|$|Commercially {{important}} {{plants in}} Asteraceae include the food crops Lactuca sativa (lettuce), Cichorium (chicory), Cynara scolymus (globe artichoke), Helianthus annuus (sunflower), Smallanthus sonchifolius (yacón), Carthamus tinctorius (safflower) and Helianthus tuberosus (Jerusalem artichoke). Plants {{are used as}} herbs and in herbal teas and other beverages. Chamomile, for example, comes from two different species: the annual Matricaria chamomilla (German chamomile) and the perennial Chamaemelum nobile (Roman chamomile). Calendula (known as pot marigold) is grown commercially for herbal teas and potpourri. Echinacea {{is used as a}} medicinal tea. The wormwood genus Artemisia includes absinthe (A. absinthium) and <b>tarragon</b> (A. dracunculus). Winter <b>tarragon</b> (Tagetes lucida), is commonly grown and used as a <b>tarragon</b> substitute in climates where <b>tarragon</b> will not survive.|$|E
