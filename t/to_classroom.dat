These state-of-the-art buildings included living space, dining halls, and training areas for four basic training squadrons under one roof. Eventually six full-size dormitories, and two 600-person facilities, were constructed, enabling excess space {{to be converted}} <b>to</b> <b>classroom</b> use.|$|E

Authorities reported pipe bombs by 1:00p.m., and two SWAT teams entered the school at 1:09p.m., moving from classroom <b>to</b> <b>classroom,</b> discovering hidden students and faculty. All students, teachers, and school employees were taken away, questioned, and offered medical care in small holding areas before being bussed to meet with their family members at Leawood Elementary. By 3:00p.m., Dave Sanders had died of his injuries before SWAT officers could take him to get medical care. He was the only teacher to die in the shooting.

25|$|Before the {{construction}} of Stanhope Hall in 1803, Nassau Hall was the college's sole building. The cornerstone of the building was laid on September 17, 1754. During the summer of 1783, the Continental Congress met in Nassau Hall, making Princeton the country's capital for four months. Over the centuries and through two redesigns following major fires (1802 and 1855), Nassau Hall's role shifted from an all-purpose building, comprising office, dormitory, library, and classroom space; <b>to</b> <b>classroom</b> space exclusively; to its present role as the administrative center of the University. The class of 1879 donated twin lion sculptures that flanked the entrance until 1911, when that same class replaced them with tigers. Nassau Hall's bell rang after the hall's construction; however, the fire of 1802 melted it. The bell was then recast and melted again in the fire of 1855.|$|E

The UCD was the first multi-institutional teaching center (MITC) for higher education in Texas and was established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board {{to provide access to}} public higher education at the upper division and graduate levels to citizens who live and work in downtown Dallas. Four of the seven floors have been converted <b>to</b> <b>classroom</b> space and are used by Texas A University-Commerce, Texas Woman's University (TWU), University of North Texas (UNT), University of Texas at Arlington (UTA), Dallas County Community College District (DCCCD) and 9th-12th grade of the Pegasus School of Liberal Arts & Sciences. The facility also contains Fashion on Main, the exhibition facility of UNT's Texas Fashion Collection. Future plans include expansion of the fashion gallery.

25|$|On April 29, 1957, the State Department of Industrial Relations {{condemned}} {{any further}} instructional use of Harrison Hall after a building inspection. As a result, Miami allocated resources {{to many of}} the academic divisions housed within Harrison Hall to other buildings on campus including Bonham House and Ogden Hall. After this, plans for the new Harrison Hall began, which were decided upon on February 1, 1958 by the Board of Trustees. The Board stated that the new Harrison Hall should be devoted <b>to</b> <b>classroom</b> purposes and that it would house the departments of Sociology and Anthropology, Psychology, Government, and the Scripps Foundation. Bids for the construction of the new building were received on October 17, 1958 by the State Architect’s Office in Columbus and construction began in January. The cornerstone was laid on May 9, 1959 and was presided by the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Hugh C. Nichols. A strike that began on June 8, 1959 interrupted the construction of the building, which was later completed in 1960.|$|E

30|$|Another {{concern in}} the {{literature}} on immigrant peers – and in the education literature more generally – is the possible nonrandom assignment of students <b>to</b> <b>classrooms</b> and schools. Using panel data from North Carolina primary schools, Rothstein (2010) argues that the nonrandom assignment of students <b>to</b> <b>classrooms</b> leads <b>to</b> biased estimates of the teacher – and presumably classroom-based peer – effects on achievement. However, Kinsler (2012) demonstrates that Rothstein’s (2010) falsification tests are problematic when sample sizes are small. Kinsler (2012) cannot reject the hypothesis of random assignment of students <b>to</b> <b>classrooms</b> when using a test that addresses potential small sample size concerns. Furthermore, Koedel and Betts (2011) show that using a complex value-added model with multiple years of data – such as the model we estimate – greatly reduces the potential bias.|$|R

2500|$|Another {{reason is}} there is less direct authority. Leaving for college {{introduces}} many students to their first time on their own without the interference of parents and guardians. Faculty and staff are less interested in interpersonal relationships between their students and thus pay less attention <b>to</b> <b>classroom</b> dynamics {{as opposed to the}} attention a high school teacher might provide.
