30|$|The {{proposed}} mechanism allows {{to manage}} a trade-off between the improvement in {{the fairness of the}} system (also the most interference vulnerable <b>air</b> <b>interface</b> can work) and the reduction of the goodput of the less interference vulnerable <b>air</b> <b>interface.</b> In particular, the LDR <b>air</b> <b>interface</b> can increase its goodput to acceptable values with a variable reduction of the HDR duty cycle (from 6.25 % to 50 %). Finally, an improved version of this mechanism (IAWA) has been proposed, which allows a more flexible distribution of the fairness among the two <b>air</b> <b>interfaces.</b> With the IAWA, it is possible to decide more flexibly the proper distribution of transmission time between the two <b>air</b> <b>interfaces</b> and hence, decide what is the best trade-off between goodput of an <b>air</b> <b>interface</b> and fairness of the system.|$|R

30|$|As {{shown in}} this paper, when the {{distance}} between the LDR and HDR WPAN <b>air</b> <b>interfaces</b> is less than 10 [*]cm, the LDR <b>air</b> <b>interface</b> experiences a noticeable performance degradation and it is completely unable to establish a reliable link when the distance becomes less than 5 [*]cm. Therefore, a coexistence mechanism becomes of utmost importance to reduce the vulnerability of the LDR <b>air</b> <b>interface</b> with respect to the interference of the HDR <b>air</b> <b>interface.</b> In particular, after presenting a simulation analysis of the interference between ECMA- 368 and IEEE 802.15. 4, this paper proposes a novel collaborative coexistence mechanism between these two standards, named Alternating Wireless Activity (AWA). The AWA algorithm is based on the time-scheduling principle: the algorithm controls and synchronizes the access to the network of the devices associated to the LDR and HDR WPANs. The two interfering networks exchange information about the structure of the their superframe and no modification to the standards is required. As for any collaborative mechanism, their implementation is more straightforward if the two <b>air</b> <b>interfaces</b> are colocated in the same multimode device [7, 11].|$|R

30|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issues of}} interference management among Low Data Rate (LDR) and High Data Rate (HDR) WPAN <b>air</b> <b>interfaces</b> that are located in close-proximity (up to 10 [*]cm) and eventually on the same multimode device. After showing the noticeable performance degradation in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER) and goodput due to the out-of-band interference of an HDR <b>air</b> <b>interface</b> over an LDR <b>air</b> <b>interface,</b> the paper presents a novel coexistence mechanism, named Alternating Wireless Activity (AWA), which is shown to greatly improve the performance in terms of goodput of the most interference vulnerable <b>air</b> <b>interface</b> (i.e., the LDR <b>air</b> <b>interface).</b> The main difference of the proposed mechanism with respect to other collaborative mechanisms based on time-scheduling is that it synchronizes the transmission of the LDR and HDR WPANs at the superframe level instead of packet level. Advantages and limitations of this choice are presented in the paper. Furthermore the functionalities of the AWA mechanism are positioned in a common protocol layer over the Medium Access Control (MAC) sublayers of the HDR and LDR devices {{and it can be}} used with any standard whose MAC is based on a superframe structure.|$|R
