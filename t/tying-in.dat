These include installing new {{equipment in the}} main process flow or <b>tying-in</b> or making provisions to tie-in sub-processes or equipment that can be installed while the process is operating.|$|E

By registering AlipayHK {{with a local}} mobile number, <b>tying-in</b> the AlipayHK account with Hong Kong issued credit cards, or topping up the AlipayHK account with cash, users are able to pay in over 2,000 designated retail outlets throughout Hong Kong. Consumers are only required to scan the merchant QR code to complete the payment.|$|E
50|$|Proponents of {{the theory}} that the Garden of Eden was located somewhere in what is now known as the Middle East suggest that the fruit was {{actually}} a pomegranate, a plant indigenous from Iraq to the Himalayas and cultivated since ancient times. The association of the pomegranate with knowledge of the underworld as provided in the Ancient Greek legend of Persephone may also have given rise to an association with knowledge of the otherworld, <b>tying-in</b> with knowledge that is forbidden to mortals.|$|E
50|$|As Ben Hermann notes, {{the play}} “mixes {{traditional}} storytelling, tragedy, humour, pop-culture references and direct audience participation to both entertain and educate audiences {{about the history}} of Indigenous Australians”. The feature of direct participation awards audiences opportunities to learn Pitjantjatjara words and phrases, thus <b>tying-in</b> the show with the language focus of the larger project. As a whole, Sometimes argues, “Ngapartji Ngapartji … exposed the general public to Indigenous language in an emotive context - theatre - providing a platform for meaningful engagement and giving liberty to understanding.".|$|E
5000|$|In 1930 Whitmore {{published}} [...] "Some Cost Accounting Terms." [...] A {{review in}} the American Accountant described this work as more of [...] "an essay on definitions." [...] And furthermore: In it Mr. Whitmore grinds a few pet axes. In the first place he objects to the connotation — or rather the lack of specific connotation — of the term cost accounts; much is said to recommend the older and the English usage of factory accounts. <b>Tying-in</b> of the cost accounts is also given a drubbing. Overhead {{is said to be}} an unfortunate term. In discussing the latter the author very properly criticizes the very common conception that overhead is a cost of production; it may also be a cost of idleness.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} pollution, as {{a by-product}} of production, into a non-tournament model of R&D with spillovers. Technology policy {{takes the form of}} either R&D subsidisation or pre-competitive R&D cooperation. We show that, when the emissions tax is exogenous, the optimal R&D subsidy can be negative, i. e. there should be a tax on R&D, depending on the extent of the appropriability problem and the degree of environmental damage. In a wide class of cases, depending on the parameter values, welfare in the case of R&D cooperation, is lower than welfare in the case of R&D subsidisation. In addition, a policy of <b>tying-in</b> the R&D subsidy to abatement results in an allocation where firms undertake the optimal (in a second-best sense) abatement level and social welfare improves...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study a {{neglected}} aspect ofteclmology policy, namely the adverse impact {{it might have}} on the envirol 1 Il 1 ent through increased production when R&D expenditure leads to cost reduction. Although teclmology policy measures that encourage finns to reduce their production costs would usually reduce energy inputs and therefore generate less pollution per unit of output production, we explore here the case where with reorganisation of production output gene rally increases. So even if per unit of production pollution is less, total pollution generated by the increased production induced by the innovative efforts of films increases. In this context it is therefore necessary {{to address the issue}} of <b>tying-in</b> teclmology and environmental policy, which is the issue we raise in this paper. We show that, irrespective of whether teclmology policy takes the fonn of R&D subsidies or R&D cooperation, R&D would gene rally lead to increased pollution and thus have a negative impact on the environment. Policies that might be optimal in the absence of concem for the enviroJUllent ceas e to be so. We claim that not only is a comparison between policy instruments more delicate but the optimal R&D subsidy might be negative. FinalIy, we propose and evaluate a speeific poliey in the form of a targeted subsidy tied-in to abatement activities and show that it is welfare improving.

40|$|In recent years, urban {{heat supply}} {{has shifted to}} the center of {{attention}} of German energy policy. It is believed that heating grids are an important instrument for climate protection. For one, they open up a heat sink (i. e. a circle of heat customers) large {{enough to be able to}} take up heat from cogeneration, which needs a certain minimum scale of operation to be economically viable. Secondly, they allow the relatively easy <b>tying-in</b> of renewable energy sources. However, heating grids are not the one-fits-all solution. As heat transport is associated with losses, a minimum heat density in urban space (that is: MWh per hectar urban space) is needed to make a district heating grid lucrative (and, possibly, ecologically worthwhile – depending on the source of the heat). At the same time, given the nature of the heat generator, a larger area served may offer economies of scale. Opportunities to construct small and medium-sized grids often are overlooked, as information about critical parameters like heat density in a neighborhood are not obvious to potential initiators of such grids. This paper offers a comparison of methods to systematically search an urban heat demand map for areas of critical heat density. Urban heat demand maps are now developed by many municipalities; they are usually constructed using electronic cadastre data, combined with an energetic building typology into which the buildings in the cadastre are mapped. Some potentially interesting opportunities for developing district heating grids may be visible to the experienced eye; algorithms that automatically search over the entire heat map may offer yet more insights. As algorithms I apply (1) a tessellation of the city into tiles of comparable size, and (2) a clustering method used to identify hot spots with two different approaches. I use selected neighborhoods in Hamburg to compare the results of both methods...|$|E
