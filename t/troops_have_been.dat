Under the command of Captain Li Shang, she and her fellow recruits Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po, gradually become trained warriors. Desiring to see Mulan succeed, Mushu creates a fake order from Shang's father, General Li, ordering Shang to follow the main Imperial Army into the mountains. The reinforcements set out, but arrive at a burnt-out encampment and discover that General Li and his <b>troops</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> massacred by the Huns.|$|E
5|$|In October 1024, Salih's forces, led by Ibn Tawq, {{advanced}} against Aleppo {{and fought}} in sporadic engagements with the Fatimid troops of governors Thu'ban and Mawsuf. Salih himself arrived at Aleppo—after having sacked several coastal districts—with {{large numbers of}} Bedouin warriors on 22 November. He besieged the city, first camping outside of Bab al-Jinan, where his demand that Ibn Abi Usama, the city's qāḍī (head Islamic judge), and other notables surrender was refused. Salih then gathered more troops and engaged Aleppo's defenders for over fifty days, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. On 18 January 1025, the Bab Qinnasrin gate was opened to Salih by Salim ibn al-Mustafad, head of the city's surviving Hamdanid ghilmān; Ibn Mustafad had defected from the Fatimids after a quarrel with Mawsuf, and together with numerous townsmen and other former ghilmān, he welcomed Salih, who granted the inhabitants safe conduct. Afterward, Salih had the towers of the city's walls demolished, according to the Egyptian contemporary chronicler, al-Musabbihi, leading the local populace to believe Salih was preparing to hand over Aleppo to the Byzantines; fearing this, they fought alongside Fatimid troops and temporarily ousted Salih's forces, killing some 250 Kilabi warriors. Zakkar views Salih's destruction of Aleppo's walls as a tactical move to enable an easier reconquest of the city should his <b>troops</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> ousted.|$|E
