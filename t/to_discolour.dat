40|$|The energy {{performance}} and degradation of 3 BP PV modules, type BP 1233, operating {{for a period}} of just more than 20 years are studied and compared to the nominal power output data. The 3 PV modules power the outdoor lighting of the Solar Campus and perform smoothly for all this period, without any special treatment or maintenance, although they were physically weathered on a continuous basis. Life cycle power degradation was estimated from a series of i, V experiments carried out under field conditions. The experimental analysis led to the determination of the present peak power, at STC, the series and shunt resistances, Rs and Rsh, respectively, and the fill factor, FF.

In about 1820 {{he was asked to}} apply his craftsmanship to making a set of dentures. Up to this time, the majority of false teeth were made from hippopotamus or walrus ivory that was prone <b>to</b> <b>discolouring,</b> or from human teeth extracted from dead bodies, including battlefield casualties (thus known as ‘Waterloo teeth’). Ash’s teeth, made of porcelain mounted on gold plates, with gold springs and swivels, were considered superior both aesthetically and functionally and laid the foundation of his new enterprise as Britain’s foremost manufacturer of dentures and dental appliances. Originally based in Broad Street (now Broadwick Street), London, the business expanded rapidly and by the mid-nineteenth century Claudius Ash dentures and dental equipment dominated the European market. Claudius Ash & Sons became an international company, in 1924 merging with de Trey & Company to form the Amalgamated Dental Company; it is now a division of Plandent Limited.|$|R
60|$|As Washington may {{be called}} the head-quarters of tobacco-tinctured saliva, the time is come when I must confess, without any disguise, that the {{prevalence}} of those two odious practices of chewing and expectorating began about this time {{to be anything but}} agreeable, and soon became most offensive and sickening. In all the public places of America, this filthy custom is recognised. In the courts of law, the judge has his spittoon, the crier his, the witness his, and the prisoner his; while the jurymen and spectators are provided for, as so many men who in the course of nature must desire to spit incessantly. In the hospitals, the students of medicine are requested, by notices upon the wall, to eject their tobacco juice into the boxes provided for that purpose, and not <b>to</b> <b>discolour</b> the stairs. In public buildings, visitors are implored, through the same agency, to squirt the essence of their quids, or 'plugs,' as I have heard them called by gentlemen learned in this kind of sweetmeat, into the national spittoons, and not about the bases of the marble columns. But in some parts, this custom is inseparably mixed up with every meal and morning call, and with all the transactions of social life. The stranger, who follows in the track I took myself, will find it in its full bloom and glory, luxuriant in all its alarming recklessness, at Washington. And let him not persuade himself (as I once did, to my shame) that previous tourists have exaggerated its extent. The thing itself is an exaggeration of nastiness, which cannot be outdone.|$|E

5000|$|First {{the object}} to be {{decorated}} is made or obtained; this will normally {{be made by}} different craftspeople. The metal usually used for making the body is copper, since it is cheap, light and easily hammered and stretched, but gold, silver or other metals may be used. Cloisonné wire is made from fine silver or fine gold and is usually about [...]010 x [...]040 inches in cross section. It is bent into shapes that define the colored areas. The bends are all done at right angles, so that the wire does not curve up. This is done with small pliers, tweezers, and custom-made jigs. The cloisonné wire pattern may consist of several intricately constructed wire patterns that fit together into a larger design. Solder {{can be used to}} join the wires, but this causes the enamel <b>to</b> <b>discolour</b> and form bubbles later on. Most existing Byzantine enamels have soldered cloisons, however the use of solder to adhere the cloison wires has fallen out of favor due to its difficulty, with the exception of some [...] "purist contemporary enamellists" [...] who create fine watch faces and high quality very expensive jewelry. Instead of soldering the cloisons to the base metal, the base metal is fired with a thin layer of clear enamel. The cloisonné wire is glued to the enamel surface with gum tragacanth. When the gum has dried, the piece is fired again to fuse the cloisonné wire to the clear enamel. The gum burns off, leaving no residue.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{aspects of}} durability of Swedish softwood in above ground applications. The thesis {{consists of a}} summary of nine papers, which all aim to explain the existing variation in above ground microbial durability and moisture sensitivity of Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). The methods used were two field tests, one accelerated durability test, and three water permeability tests. The main conclusions made {{in the study were}} that Norway spruce sapwood is more susceptible <b>to</b> <b>discolouring</b> fungi than heartwood. With respect to Scots pine, the only important factor for its natural durability above ground was whether the samples consisted of heartwood or of sapwood. There was also no systematic variation between pine heartwood from different stand origins in above ground conditions. Origin had no influence on durability in practice for neither spruce nor pine. Furthermore, in contradiction with traditional thinking, annual ring width and density had no influence on durability in any of the tests. The material came from two different samplings. The ‘old’ material was sampled {{in the beginning of the}} 1980 s and consisted of Scots pine and Norway spruce from three different origins: the north, the central area, and the south of Sweden. The material was subjected to different handling conditions and surface and end-grain treatments. The ‘old’ material was used in a large above ground field test, carried out between 1985 and 1994. Unfortunately, the spruce sapwood and heartwood was not separated in this field test. In the field trial with the ‘old’ material, the most important factor for the durability of Norway spruce was the samples’ surface- and end-grain treatment. It was also observed that untreated spruce showed better durability than samples that were painted but without proper end-grain treatment. Samples originating from one of the stands were more sensitive towards air-drying than samples from the other two, which was reflected in a higher average moisture content and mass loss for the untreated samples. With respect to Scots pine, the most important factor was whether the sample consisted of heartwood or of sapwood. The heartwood samples were durable irrespective of their previous treatment. The Scots pine sapwood samples, on the other hand, had a very fluctuating moisture content if they were not surface- and end-painted. This was also reflected in higher mass losses in these samples. Even when properly surface- and end grain treated, the sapwood samples did not perform as well as the heartwood samples. The ‘new’ material consisted of Scots pine taken from six different stands, and Norway spruce from five different stands, all from areas in southern Sweden. The sampling was performed in order to achieve a large variation in wood properties. Thus, logs from areas with different climate and growth conditions were collected. This material was used for laboratory tests, and also for the second field test, which was evaluated after a test period of two years. In the second field test untreated Scots pine and Norway spruce samples from the ‘new’ material were investigated. Effects of origin and different tree diameters were examined. Furthermore, Scots pine was separated to heartwood and sapwood, and Norway spruce to mature and juvenile wood. The Norway spruce samples were sawn with vertical or horizontal annual rings. For the Norway spruce in the second field test, vertical annual rings were shown to be very beneficial for avoiding crack formation, while samples with horizontal annual rings displayed a large number of cracks. Despite this, the larger number of cracks did not result in a higher moisture content or more fungal discoloration. Juvenile wood had a slightly higher average discolouring fungal growth grading than the other spruce samples. For Scots pine, the only factor of importance was whether the samples consisted of heartwood or of sapwood. Annual ring width, density and origin had no significant effect on either fungal growth or moisture uptake. This observation held for both Norway spruce samples and Scots pine samples. An accelerated test was run in order to investigate Norway spruce sapwood and heartwood with respect to their differences in durability towards discolouring fungi and moisture uptake. The Mycologg method was used to accelerate fungal growth during a number of forced moisture cycles. The results showed that sapwood was much more sensitive <b>to</b> <b>discolouring</b> fungi than heartwood. Sapwood also recorded a higher average moisture content than heartwood. The differences that were observed between the types of samples were not due to annual ring width, density or origin. It was observed that Norway spruce sapwood samples and heartwood samples showed differences in liquid water permeability. This observation was made especially evident in a droplet absorption test. Water droplets were absorbed much faster on the sapwood samples in comparison with the heartwood samples. This higher affinity to water suggested that a sapwood surface would reach a higher moisture content than a heartwood surface. This observation provides a major explanation of why the sapwood samples showed poorer durability towards discolouring fungi in the Mycologg trials...|$|R

We had lately learnt, that these animals were esteemed by the Indians as more delicate food than their pork; and upon this occasion we determined to try the experiment; the dog, which was very fat, we consigned over to Tupia, who undertook to perform the double office of butcher and cook. He killed him by holding his hands close over his mouth and nose, an operation which continued above a quarter of an hour. While this was doing, a hole was made in the ground about a foot deep, in which a fire was kindled, and some small stones placed in layers alternately with the wood to heat; the dog was then singed, by holding him over the fire, and, by scraping him with a shell, the hair taken off as clean {{as if he had been}} scalded in hot water: he was then cut up with the same instrument, and his entrails being taken out, were sent to the sea, where being carefully washed, they were put into cocoa-nut shells, with what blood had come from the body; when the hole was sufficiently heated, the fire was taken out, and some of the stones, which were not so hot as <b>to</b> <b>discolour</b> any thing that they touched, being placed at the bottom, were covered with green leaves, the dog, with the entrails, was then placed upon the leaves, and other leaves being laid upon them, the whole was covered with the rest of the hot stones, and the mouth of the hole close stopped with mould: in somewhat less than four hours it was again opened, and the dog taken out excellently baked, and we all agreed that he made a very good dish.

Methods. A total of 140 roots were prepared and the canals were filled with Ledermix paste (demeclocycline), Odontopaste (clindamycin), and Doxypaste (doxycycline). The pastes were removed after 2 or 4 weeks of storage in the dark using EDTA and NaOCl with either a 27 -gauge-slotted needle or an Endo Activator (Dentsply). The roots were then exposed to an intense light source for 30 minutes each week and photographed after a further 1, 3, or 6 months. Digital images were standardized and data for changes in luminosity were analysed using repeated measures ANOVA and a post hoc test. Results. Removal of the medicament did not prevent later discolouration. There {{was no significant difference between}} the paste removal methods. Ledermix paste caused the greatest darkening compared to the untreated controls, for both application periods and both methods of removal.

40|$|Two {{reliable}} small-plant bioassays {{were developed}} using tissue-cultured banana, resulting in consistent symptom expression and infection by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc). One bioassay {{was based on}} providing a constant watertable within a closed pot and the second used free-draining pots. Culture medium for spore generation influenced infectivity of Foc. Inoculation of potted banana by drenching potting mix with a conidial suspension, consisting mostly of microconidia, few macroconidia and no chlamydospores, generated from one-quarter-strength potato dextrose agar + streptomycin sulfate, resulted in inconsistent infection. When a conidial suspension that consisted of all three spore types, microconidia, macroconidia and chlamydospores, prepared from spores generated on carnation leaf agar was used, all plants became infected, indicating that the spore type present in conidial suspensions may contribute to inconsistency of infection. Inconsistency of infection was not due to loss of virulence of the pathogen in culture. Millet grain precolonised by Foc {{as a source of}} inoculum resulted in consistent infection between replicate plants. Sorghum was not a suitable grain for preparation of inoculum as it was observed <b>to</b> <b>discolour</b> roots and has the potential to stunt root growth, possibly due to the release of phytotoxins.

The drying kinetics {{and the effects}} of osmotic dehydration (OD) and air-drying temperature on antioxidant capacity, total phenolics, colour and texture were determined. Analysis of variance revealed that OD and air-drying temperature have a significant influence on the quality of seeds. Both anthocyanin and total phenolic contents decreased when air-drying temperature increased. The radical diphenylpicril-hydrazyl activity showed the lowest antioxidant activity at 60 °C. Both chromatic parameters (L*, C* and h°) and browning index were affected by drying temperatures, which contributed <b>to</b> the <b>discolouring</b> of seeds.

In view of these results, the temperature of 40 °C is recommended as it has the lowest impact on the quality parameters of the seeds. Differential scanning calorimetry data provided complementary information on the mobility changes of water during drying.

40|$|The total viable {{cell count}} of {{bacteria}} in vacuum-packaged chilled minced beef has been decreased equally, by approx. two log-cycles, as {{an effect of}} 1. 5 - 2. 0 kGy gamma radiation or 200 - 300 MPa high hydrostatic pressure (UHP) treatment for 20 min. Coliform bacteria could be eliminated to non-detectable levels by the same treatments. The shelf-life of both untreated and non-thermally pasteurised samples were limited mainly by growth of lactic acid bacteria. At about equal bactericidal effect, more drastic changes of texture and colour occurred in UHP-pasteurized minced beef samples than in the radiation-pasteurized ones. Whereas radiation pasteurisation caused minimal changes in appearance, texture and DSC-thermograms of minced beef, UHP-pasteurisation of the raw samples proved <b>to</b> be strongly <b>discolouring</b> by denaturing the muscle pigments and causing extensive denaturation of the myofibrillar proteins. The water holding capacity of irradiated samples decreased, while that of high pressure treated ones increased {{as compared to the}} untreated control. Near infrared spectrometry and electronic nose measurements gave promising results to make distinctions non-destructively on changes of various physical-chemical changes and quality parameters as a function of pasteurising treatments and/or storage...|$|R
40|$|Pine (Pinus sylvestris) and spruce (Picea abies) of Swedish origin {{has been}} {{heat-treated}} {{according to a}} process intended for above-ground end-uses. Tests {{have been carried out}} in order to study and evaluate the durability of the heat-treated material against decay and discolouring micro-organisms as well as technical and other properties, such as bending strength, stiffness, delamination of glulam, withdrawal load for fasteners and chemical emissions. The tests have shown that the bending strength has been reduced by approximately 50 % whereas the stiffness has been much less affected. Thus, the use of heat-treated wood where the strength is a decisive property should be carefully considered. There is an indication that the withdrawal load for fasteners for heat-treated wood is lower than for untreated wood. Gluing of heat-treated wood needs particular consideration, and PVAc adhesives seems to be unsuitable for gluing heat-treated wood. Chemical emissions (VOCs) were very low and will not be any major problem, providing proper conditioning is carried out after treatment. Heat-treated wood seems to be less susceptible <b>to</b> attack by <b>discolouring</b> micro-organisms than untreated wood. The decay tests in the laboratory and in the field have not yet given an unambiguous answer concerning the performance in various end-uses. However, the use of heat-treated wood in ground contact should be avoided...|$|R
