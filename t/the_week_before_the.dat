Nevertheless, Austrian referee Erich Linemayr {{decided that the}} first leg on 9 May would still go ahead.

5|$|After 24 hours, only 2,500 {{men of the}} 101st and 2,000 of the 82nd Airborne {{were under}} the control of their divisions, {{approximately}} a third of the force dropped. This wide dispersal had the effect of confusing the Germans and fragmenting their response. The 7th Army received notification of the parachute drops at 01:20, but Rundstedt did not initially believe that a major invasion was underway. The destruction of radar stations along the Normandy coast in <b>the</b> <b>week</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> invasion meant that the Germans did not detect the approaching fleet until 02:00.|$|E

Wes Brown, Scholes and Ryan Giggs were all doubts for the final, after they had picked up knocks in <b>the</b> <b>week</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> final. They would also be without striker Diego Forlán, who had injured his ankle against Juventus, however, defender Mikaël Silvestre was declared fit to start.|$|E
5|$|Everton spent <b>the</b> <b>week</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> {{match in}} the spa town of Buxton, and {{travelled}} to Dorking {{on the eve}} of the match. Manchester City spent the week in Bushey. Everton's James Dunn received treatment on a thigh injury in the ten days preceding the game, but was anticipated to be fit enough to play. Manchester City's main injury worry was Fred Tilson, who was troubled by a leg injury. Dunn was passed fit well before the game, allowing Everton to field the same line-up that played in four of their five previous cup ties.|$|E

Under {{the terms of the}} sale, the Sahara Group became Force India's naming-rights sponsor. Mercedes GP also changed the name of their team, announcing that they were to become known as Mercedes AMG.

Liverpool F.C. arranged {{for most of the}} affected fans to receive tickets from an allocation that had been held back for a lottery among their supporters. The day after the final, South Wales Police seized 100 stolen tickets. Three people were arrested after 15 forged tickets were found ahead of the match.|$|E
5|$|Jaguar's {{marketing}} department had allocated space on their {{stand at the}} motor show for the XJ220, but {{had not seen the}} vehicle until its arrival.

The car received an overwhelmingly positive reception by public and press, and a number of wealthy Jaguar enthusiasts handed over blank cheques to secure a purchase option should the XJ220 concept go into production. Ferrari's display of their F40 model at the same event was overshadowed; an estimated 90,000 additional visitors came to see the Jaguar XJ220.|$|E

5|$|As a {{preparation}} for the World Championships in Tuscany Van Dijk went during the season {{a few times to}} Italy to practise the time trial course. She trained at five in the morning to avoid traffic and made video recordings of the course {{to get to know the}} turns. In <b>the</b> <b>week</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> World Championships she won the French time trial Chrono Champenois – Trophée Européen. All the preparations paid off and the World Championships were very successful for Van Dijk. With her team she won for the second consecutive year the world title in the team time trial. Because Van Dijk had won almost all the time trials this year she was also the main favourite for the individual time trial. Despite the pressure she won the time trial with a convincing victory and became the second Dutch women to win this title. At the end of the championships, Van Dijk finished 16th on a non-preferable hilly road race course.|$|E
5|$|As both Birmingham City and Manchester City were First Division clubs, {{they entered}} the {{competition}} in the third round. Manchester City's cup run started with a home tie against Blackpool. The visitors took the lead after only 10seconds (their fastest goal ever), but midway through the match, fog enveloped Maine Road. The match was abandoned during the second half, immediately after City had scored an equalising goal, and replayed the following Wednesday; City won 2–1. In the fourth round Manchester City faced Southend United at Roots Hall. The Essex club's ground had only opened five months previously, and was suffering from drainage problems. Torrential rainfall meant that in <b>the</b> <b>week</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> match a trench was dug across the pitch, and sand added. Though Southend were a Third Division team, their familiarity with the uneven pitch meant the match was closely contested. Southend pressured the Manchester City goal, requiring Bert Trautmann to make several saves, but Joe Hayes scored the only goal of the game on a City counter-attack to earn a fifth-round tie against Liverpool.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{passenger}} facilities, Wood Siding was {{the starting point for}} the first passenger service to operate on the line. On 26 August 1871 an excursion service ran from Wood Siding to London hauled by the Great Western Railway (GWR). It carried around 150 people, for a total of 105 passenger fares (with each child counted as half an adult), and was drawn by horses between Wood Siding and Quainton Road and by locomotive from Quainton Road to Aylesbury where the carriages were attached to the 7.30am GWR service via Princes Risborough to London, arriving at 10.00am. The experiment was not a success. Sharp overhanging branches along the route posed a danger to passengers and had to be cut back in <b>the</b> <b>week</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> excursion. The day itself was extremely rainy, and ticket sales were lower than expected. The return train from London to Quainton Road was delayed in Slough, and the excursion eventually arrived back at Wood Siding at 2.00am.|$|E
5|$|Hunt's 2001 {{scholarship}} came {{to fruition}} {{when he joined}} the Brisbane Broncos' main squad {{at the end of the}} 2003 season. He participated in the team's off-season training in early 2004, under the guidance of Broncos' coach Wayne Bennett, and was selected to participate in the Broncos' pre-season trial games in February. Hunt had expected to play most of the 2004 season in the Queensland Cup, the second-tier rugby league competition in Queensland. However, after Darren Lockyer's shift to the five-eighth position and Hunt playing both trial games on the wing and scoring a try in the first game against the Melbourne Storm, he was selected to make his National Rugby League (NRL) debut for the Broncos in the first round of the 2004 season against the New Zealand Warriors, making him the youngest ever Bronco at seventeen. Coach Bennett's decision to name Hunt as the starting fullback was somewhat surprising, due to Hunt's original selection, <b>the</b> <b>week</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> match, on the interchange bench. He replaced Motu Tony in the fullback position.|$|E
