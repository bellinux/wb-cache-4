5|$|The man taking coins from <b>the</b> <b>tray</b> is Andrzej Kościelecki, {{treasurer}} and Court Marshal who skillfully {{managed the}} state finances. Looking proudly, unworried, seeing only victory, he symbolizes {{the importance and}} wealth of Polish officials of the period.|$|E
5|$|Bob {{has been}} fooled by Jeanie's lies {{about why they}} are not going out, and is enlightened when Sidney lets slip that Larry and Jeanie are seeing each other. Bob demands proof, and Sidney tells Bob to watch what happens in the wings during the {{upcoming}} Act 1 finale to Me and Juliet. Bob sees Larry and Jeanie kiss after she comes offstage with a tray of flowers, an action caught by Bob's spotlight. Mac enters, grasps the situation, sends Larry away, then puts <b>the</b> <b>tray</b> back in Jeanie's hands and pushes her onstage. She is pursued by Bob's spotlight, which relentlessly follows her around the stage as {{more and more of the}} dancers become aware something has gone badly wrong. Bob drops a sandbag from the light bridge; it knocks <b>the</b> <b>tray</b> Jeanie is holding to the ground. Mac orders the curtain lowered in front of a stage in panic.|$|E
5|$|By N42 and S89 the equestrian parade {{is at an}} end, and the {{following}} 16 figures on the north and 18 on the south are taken to be the elders of Athens judging by their braided hair, an attribute of distinguished age in Classical art. Four of these figures raise their right hand in a clenched fist gesture suggestive of a pose associated with the thallophoroi (olive branch bearers) who were older men chosen in competition for their good looks alone. No drill holes, however, exist for any branch to be inserted in their hands. Next in line (S107–114, N20–28) are the musicians: four kithara (a variant of the lyre) and four aulos (flute) players. N16–19 and S115–118 (conjectured) perhaps, as hydriaphoroi, the water-vessel carriers, here men, rather than metic girls mentioned {{in the literature on}} the Panathenaia. N13–15, S119–121 are the skaphephoroi, <b>the</b> <b>tray</b> bearers of the honeycombs and cakes used to entice the sacrificial animals to the altar. N1–12, S122–149 are the four cows and four sheep on the north and ten cows on the south meant for sacrifice on the acropolis, presumably an abbreviated form of the hecatomb usually offered on this occasion – there is an a-b-a rhythm of placid and restive cows.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>trays</b> {{were made}} of self-cured acrylic resin (Acrostone cold cure special tray material, Cairo, Egypt). <b>The</b> <b>trays</b> were {{perforated}} for added retention of <b>the</b> impression material. <b>Tray</b> handles were made and attached to <b>the</b> custom <b>trays.</b> <b>The</b> <b>trays</b> were stored at the room temperature for 24  h before impression taking.|$|R

25|$|Wait staff trays are {{typically}} large circular disks used to serve drinks and/or food {{to people in}} restaurants, bars, and other hospitality industry businesses. The waiter or waitress carries <b>the</b> <b>tray</b> with the open palm of one hand placed underneath, in about the center of <b>the</b> <b>tray,</b> relying on dry friction between the hand and the smooth metal or plastic undersurface of <b>the</b> <b>tray</b> to retain control of <b>the</b> <b>tray.</b> Occasionally, <b>the</b> <b>tray</b> may slide from the waitperson's hand, and the contents crash to the floor. In a May 2012 survey of food industry servers, those responding revealed nearly 25 percent of staff that work or have worked in the hospitality industry have suffered an injury {{as a result of}} a toppled serving tray. Of those people questioned, 23 percent had burned or cut themselves while trying to serve drinks or food from a serving tray.|$|E
25|$|Different {{devices have}} been {{developed}} {{in an effort to}} assist waitstaff in stabilising the service trays. Inventors have tried techniques such as attaching finger knobs/hubs (1998) and removable hand posts (2010) that protrude from the underside of <b>the</b> <b>tray.</b> They also tried the use of finger insertion holes in <b>the</b> <b>tray</b> to stabilize <b>the</b> <b>tray.</b> To restrain the hand to the underside of <b>the</b> <b>tray,</b> inventors have looked into devices such as a hand panel allowing insertion of two fingers of a hand (1985), a separately-fingered digit forward-retention device (1999), and a stretchable strap that forms a loop into which the user's fingers are inserted (2003).|$|E
25|$|In December 2009 Alison Grieve, a 32-year-old {{waitress}} and event manager from Bruntsfield, Edinburgh, {{witnessed a}} waitress drop a tray full of glasses of champagne at a corporate event for {{a delegation of}} international lawyers. To address how a tray could right itself {{at the moment of}} impending tilt, Grieve, a first-time inventor with a university background in 'History of film and photography', developed a finger receiver attached to the bottom of a wait tray based on first-principle physics, load dispersal, and counter movement. In a closed position, the finger receiver lays flush with the bottom of the wait tray so that <b>the</b> <b>tray</b> can sit on the surface of a bar or table without wobbling and can be stacked onto other trays. When the device is open, two slots can be accessed into which a waitperson may secure their two inside fingers, similar to how a flip-flop structurally attaches itself between the toes of the foot to counter the large stresses place upon it. The Safetray product's arrangement creates a strong cantilever advantage for the waitperson to allow them additional control over torque caused by items placed in various locations around <b>the</b> <b>tray.</b> The stability achieved with the Safetray product allows a waitperson to place a bottle of wine right at the edge of <b>the</b> <b>tray</b> while still keeping <b>the</b> <b>tray</b> in a horizontal position by reacting instinctively against the bottle's off-balance downward force.|$|E

25|$|Indoor tray growing is {{the most}} common {{commercial}} technique, followed by containerized growing. <b>The</b> <b>tray</b> technique provides the advantages of scalability and easier harvesting. Unlike wild harvests, indoor techniques provide tight control over growing substrate composition and growing conditions. Indoor harvests are much more predictable.|$|E
25|$|Safetray is a {{brand name}} for a {{retractable}} finger receiver incorporated into the underside of a round wait staff tray to assist in handling <b>the</b> <b>tray</b> when carrying food and drinks for service in the hospitality industry. The handclip design provides leverage, helping to prevent toppling. The Safetray, invented in 2009, is now sold worldwide by Edinburgh-based Safetray Products Ltd.|$|E
30|$|Within the {{limitations}} of this study, there were generally {{no significant differences between}} open and closed, although better results were obtained for <b>the</b> open <b>tray</b> techniques. On <b>the</b> use of the non-parallel implants, <b>the</b> open <b>tray</b> technique provided a better result than <b>the</b> closed <b>tray</b> technique.|$|R

25|$|Raiment {{might be}} ceremoniously {{brought into the}} specially-decorated bedchamber where the new mother lay: in a desco da parto by Masaccio of 1427, <b>the</b> <b>tray</b> and a covered cup are preceded {{by a pair of}} {{trumpeters}} flying banners with the Florentine gigli. In fact in patrician households the bed was often placed in a reception room for the occasion (if there was not one already in such a room, after the fashion of the French and Burgundian courts), and the mother lay there while receiving visits from her friends over several days.|$|E
50|$|On hatch day (day 21), <b>the</b> <b>trays</b> {{are removed}} ("pulled") from the hatchers, {{and then the}} chicks are removed from <b>the</b> <b>trays.</b> Chicks are inspected, with the sickly ones being {{disposed}} of. Chicks may be by vaccinated, sorted by sex, counted, and placed in chick boxes.(Example1) (Example2) Stacks of chick boxes are loaded into trucks for transport, and arrive at the broiler farm on the same day. Specialized climate-controlled trucks are typically used, depending on climate and transport distance.|$|R
50|$|When {{a book is}} reserved, {{somebody}} {{needs to}} check the catalog, and, if the book {{is not on the}} shelf, look for the relevant card in <b>the</b> <b>trays.</b> This involves manually looking for the card with the matching 'key' in <b>the</b> <b>trays,</b> sequentially looking in each date until found. A reserved item is flagged with a piece of colored card, so that when it is returned it can be set aside and checked against the file of reservations.|$|R

25|$|In 2011, {{research}} led by Dalila Bovet of Paris West University Nanterre La Défense, demonstrated African grey parrots {{were able}} to coordinate and collaborate {{with each other to}} an extent. They {{were able to}} solve problems such as two birds having to pull strings {{at the same time to}} obtain food. In another example, one bird stood on a perch to release a food-laden tray, while the other pulled <b>the</b> <b>tray</b> out from the test apparatus. Both would then feed. The birds were observed waiting for their partners to perform the necessary actions so their behaviour could be synchronized. The parrots appeared to express individual preferences as to which of the other test birds they would work with.|$|E
25|$|Traditional Japanese {{table setting}} {{is to place}} a bowl of rice on your left and to place a bowl of miso soup on your right side at the table. Behind these, each okazu is served on its own {{individual}} plate. Based on the standard three okazu formula, behind the rice and soup are three flat plates to hold the three okazu; one to far back left, one at far back right, {{and one in the}} center. Pickled vegetables are often served on the side but are not counted as part of the three okazu. Chopsticks are generally placed at the very front of <b>the</b> <b>tray</b> near the diner with pointed ends facing left and supported by a chopstick rest, or hashioki.|$|E
25|$|Silk moths {{lay eggs}} on {{specially}} prepared paper. The eggs hatch and the caterpillars (silkworms) are fed fresh mulberry leaves. After about 35 days and 4 moltings, the caterpillars are 10,000 times heavier than when hatched and {{are ready to}} begin spinning a cocoon. A straw frame is placed over <b>the</b> <b>tray</b> of caterpillars, and each caterpillar begins spinning a cocoon by moving its head in a pattern. Two glands produce liquid silk and force it through openings in the head called spinnerets. Liquid silk is coated in sericin, a water-soluble protective gum, and solidifies on contact with the air. Within 2–3 days, the caterpillar spins about 1 mile of filament and is completely encased in a cocoon. The silk farmers then heat the cocoons to kill them, leaving some to metamorphose into moths to breed {{the next generation of}} caterpillars. Harvested cocoons are then soaked in boiling water to soften the sericin holding the silk fibers together in a cocoon shape. The fibers are then unwound to produce a continuous thread. Since a single thread is too fine and fragile for commercial use, anywhere from three to ten strands are spun together to form a single thread of silk.|$|E

For the non-parallel implants, <b>the</b> open <b>tray</b> technique provided a better result than <b>the</b> closed <b>tray</b> technique. <b>The</b> open <b>tray</b> impression technique exhibited the least horizontal and vertical discrepancies for the Straumann, SIC Invent, and Osstem implant systems.|$|R
500|$|The BLT {{became popular}} after World War II {{because of the}} rapid {{expansion}} of supermarkets, which allowed ingredients to be available year-round. The initials, representing [...] "bacon, lettuce, tomato", likely began in the American restaurant industry as shorthand for the sandwich, but it is unclear when this transferred to the public consciousness. For example, a 1951 edition of the Saturday Evening Post makes reference to the sandwich, although it does not use its initials, describing a scene in which: [...] "On <b>the</b> <b>tray,</b> invariably, are a bowl of soup, a toasted sandwich of bacon, lettuce and tomato, and a chocolate milk shake." ...|$|E
500|$|So {{much time}} had been spent on [...] "screwdriver work" [...] that Eno {{thought it would be}} best to start from scratch. His idea was to [...] "stage an accident" [...] and have the song's tapes erased. He said that this was not to force {{abandonment}} of the song, but rather that it would be more effective to start again with a fresh performance. At one point, Eno had the tapes cued up and ready to be recorded over, but this erasure never took place; according to engineer Flood, fellow engineer Pat McCarthy returned to the control room and upon seeing Eno ready to erase the tapes, dropped <b>the</b> <b>tray</b> of tea he was carrying and physically restrained Eno.|$|E
