25|$|There is {{a diverse}} range and {{combination}} of methodologies employed {{to understand the}} hydrological dynamics in salt marshes {{and their ability to}} trap and accrete sediment. Sediment traps are often used to measure rates of marsh surface accretion when short term deployments (e.g. less than one month) are required. These circular traps consist of pre-weighed filters that are anchored to the marsh surface, then dried in a laboratory and re-weighed to determine the total deposited sediment. For longer term studies (e.g. more than one year) researchers may prefer to measure sediment accretion with marker horizon plots. Marker horizons consist of a mineral such as feldspar that is buried at a known depth within wetland substrates to record the increase in overlying substrate over long time periods. In order to gauge the amount of sediment suspended in the water column, manual or automated samples of tidal water can be poured through pre-weighed filters in a laboratory then dried to determine the amount of sediment per volume of water. Another method for estimating suspended sediment concentrations is by measuring the turbidity of the water using optical backscatter probes, which can be calibrated against water samples containing a known suspended sediment concentration to establish a regression relationship between the two. Marsh surface elevations may be measured with a stadia rod and transit, electronic theodolite, Real-Time Kinematic Global Positioning System, laser level or electronic distance meter (<b>total</b> <b>station).</b> Hydrological dynamics include water depth, measured automatically with a pressure transducer, or with a marked wooden stake, and water velocity, often using electromagnetic current meters.|$|E

[...] These Salish Defensive Sites are rock wall features constructed by Coast Salish peoples. [...] One was excavated by Kisha Supernant in 2008 at Yale, British Columbia. The functions {{of these features}} may have included defense, fishing platforms, and creation of house terraces. House pits and stone tools {{have been found in}} association with certain sites. Methods used include use of a <b>total</b> <b>station</b> for mapping the sites as well as the creation of simple test pits to probe for stratigraphy and artifacts.|$|E

5000|$|In surveying, free {{stationing}} (also {{known as}} resection) {{is a method}} of determining a location of one unknown point in relation to known points.
