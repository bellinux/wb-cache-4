5|$|After {{his release}} from the Jaguars, the Chicago Bears worked out Kafka on October 25, 2013, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers worked him out on November 5, the Atlanta Falcons worked him out on November 19, and the Dallas Cowboys worked him out on February 6, 2014. He signed with the Buccaneers on February 10. During {{training}} camp, Kafka competed against Alex Tanney for the third-string quarterback spot behind Josh McCown and Mike Glennon. Kafka went 2-of-7 for 14yards in the first preseason game, 4-of-11 for 55yards and a touchdown in the second preseason game, and 7-of-14 for 86yards and a touchdown in the fourth preseason game. He was released during final roster cuts with Tanney on August 30, 2014, but was subsequently re-signed to the team's practice squad on August 31. After spending <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> of the season on the practice squad, Kafka was promoted to the active roster on September 25 due to an injury suffered by starter McCown. He was active but did not play in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> {{he was on the}} active roster. He was declared inactive in week 8 with McCown healthy again, and he was waived on October 28. He was re-signed to the practice squad on October 30. At the conclusion of the 2014 NFL season, Kafka's practice squad contract expired and he was not re-signed by the team.|$|E
5|$|The tour started poorly for Harvey. In five {{innings in}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks,</b> he scored only 36 runs at 7.20, and this {{included}} a ten-wicket defeat {{at the hands}} of Laker and Lock's Surrey. It was Australia's first loss to a county side since 1912. Harvey began to run into some form after that, scoring 45 against Cambridge University before the match against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which fielded a virtual England Test team in what was effectively a dress rehearsal for the Tests. Harvey made 225 in Australia's 413 and the hosts made 9/203 to draw the match. However, he was unable to replicate this form in the Tests.|$|E

5|$|Allied {{planners}} envisaged {{preceding the}} sea-borne landings with airborne drops: near Caen {{on the eastern}} flank to secure the Orne River bridges, and north of Carentan on the western flank. The initial goal was to capture Carentan, Isigny, Bayeux, and Caen. The Americans, assigned to land at Utah and Omaha, were {{to cut off the}} Cotentin Peninsula and capture the port facilities at Cherbourg. The British at Sword and Gold, and the Canadians at Juno, were to capture Caen and form a front line from Caumont-l'Éventé to the south-east of Caen {{in order to protect the}} American flank, while establishing airfields near Caen. Possession of Caen and its surroundings would give the Anglo-Canadian forces a suitable staging area for a push south to capture the town of Falaise. A secure lodgement would be established and an attempt made to hold all territory captured north of the Avranches-Falaise line during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks.</b> The Allied armies would then swing left to advance towards the River Seine.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{extensive}} damage resulting from the hurricane, where the Hornets would play for the 2005–06 season came into question.

With the training camp scheduled to begin on October 4, the team announced that <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> of camp would be held at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, instead of their usual location, Alario Center in Westwego. Additionally the team stated that they wanted to play home games within Louisiana, at either the Pete Maravich Assembly Center or the Rivercenter in Baton Rouge. On September 3, Hornets owner George Shinn stated that the storm would not be used as a reason to permanently relocate the franchise.|$|E

5|$|Div Cav spent <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> of {{the pursuit}} camped near Bardia. On 2 December, {{as part of}} the {{outflanking}} move around El Agheila, the regiment began an eight-day drive on transporters to El Haseiat. After unloading its vehicles, the regiment continued its flanking movement. On 14 December, it was placed under the command of the 4th Light Armoured Brigade, with which it spent the night. C Squadron screened the brigade in the morning and by 16:00 the regiment had drawn away from the brigade as C Squadron reached the escarpment. The German 15th Panzer Division, halted on the road due to a fuel shortage, was targeted by Div Cav. During the night, the regiment withdrew and laagered while the Germans retreated. At 05:45 the next morning, XXX Corps headquarters ordered the division to attack the Germans and the regiment was advised to expect an attack from the east by a hundred tanks. Div Cav was ordered to withdraw south-west, along the line of its previous advance. When the regiment had gone back , it surprised a German column. ASquadron engaged, as the other squadrons hastily withdrew. In the evening, the regiment advanced a mile west and laagered.|$|E

50|$|The {{reasons for}} {{the size of the}} defeat have been put down to the general lack of {{experience}} within the diminished squad as a whole, with most of the players only getting involved in the game at most eighteen months prior to the tournament starting.

5000|$|One Japanese chronicle {{mentions}} a clash in August 1592 {{which involved}} three Korean turtle ships [...] "covered in iron".

Stephen Turnbull, however, points {{out the fact that}} the Japanese government ordered in February 1593 the military to use iron plate in building ships, possibly in response to the Korean attacks.|$|R
