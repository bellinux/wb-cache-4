5|$|In 1753 the French began {{expanding}} <b>their</b> <b>military</b> control {{into the}} Ohio Country, a territory already {{claimed by the}} British colonies of Virginia and Pennsylvania. These competing claims led to {{a war in the}} colonies called the French and Indian War (1754–62) and contributed {{to the start of the}} global Seven Years' War (1756–63). By chance, Washington became involved in its beginning.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{twenty years}} after the battle, President Ivo Josipović {{presented}} the Charter of the Republic of Croatia to the commanders and units involved in the battle, commending <b>their</b> <b>military</b> achievements.

5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, European nations used cockades, or {{knots of}} colored ribbons {{pinned to the}} hat, to denote the {{nationality}} of <b>their</b> <b>military.</b> In Poland, until 1831, there was no consensus {{as to what the}} colors of the national cockade should be.

5|$|The Iazyges wore heavy armor, such as Sugarloaf helms, {{and scale}} armor (made of iron, bronze, horn or horse hoof). They used long two-handed lances called Contus, which they wielded from horses, whom they barded. <b>Their</b> <b>military</b> was {{exclusively}} {{made up of}} cavalry.

5|$|The Ottomans {{were able}} to build on <b>their</b> <b>military</b> success due to the {{numerous}} divisions amongst their opponents. Many of the peasant classes in Anatolia saw the Ottomans as the better master.|$|E
5|$|After their {{expulsion}} from Mecca, the Muslims fought the Meccan Quraysh at the Battle of Badr in 624, {{and at the}} Battle of Uhud in 625. Although the Muslims neither won nor were defeated at the Battle of Uhud, <b>their</b> <b>military</b> strength was gradually growing. In April 626 Muhammad raised a force of 300 men and 10 horses to meet the Quraysh army of 1,000 at Badr for the second time. Although no fighting occurred, the coastal tribes were impressed with Muslim power. Muhammad also tried, with limited success, to break up many alliances against the Muslim expansion. Nevertheless, {{he was unable to}} prevent the Meccan one.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the war, the Ho-Chunk tribe was {{compelled}} to cede the lead mining region to the United States. The Americans also increased <b>their</b> <b>military</b> presence on the frontier, building Fort Winnebago and reoccupying two other abandoned forts. The conflict convinced some officials that Americans and Indians could not live peaceably together, and that the Natives should be compelled to move westward, a policy known as Indian removal. The Winnebago War preceded the larger Black Hawk War of 1832, which involved many of the same people and concerned similar issues.|$|E
5|$|Aside from Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, master gunnery {{sergeant}} (MGySgt) and {{sergeant major}} {{are the highest}} enlisted ranks in the Marine Corps; however, there are far fewer master gunnery sergeants than sergeants major. One of the major {{differences between the two}} E-9 ranks is that master gunnery sergeants retain <b>their</b> <b>Military</b> Occupational Specialty (MOS), while sergeants major are given a new MOS to reflect their general command focus. This reinforces the master gunnery sergeant's role as a provider of technical military leadership.|$|E
5|$|By 1972 the United States and the Soviet Union {{were focused}} on détente. The Arabs were worried, as it meant <b>their</b> <b>military</b> {{situation}} in regards to Israel would remain at a disadvantage. Believing diplomatic avenues had reached a dead end, Sadat focused on taking decisive military action. A renewed conflict with Israel would disrupt Soviet-American détente, force superpower intervention and make {{the solution of the}} Arab-Israeli conflict a center-stage issue to Israel, the US and the USSR.|$|E

25|$|Exceptions were few, {{but neither}} ancient Sparta nor ancient Rome had walls {{for a long}} time, {{choosing}} to rely on <b>their</b> <b>militaries</b> for defense instead.

5|$|Confederate Army {{officers}} indicated <b>their</b> <b>military</b> {{affiliation with}} different colored facing on their coats or jackets. The colors were red for artillery, yellow for cavalry, light blue for infantry, and black for medical. A very distinctive {{feature of the}} Confederate officers uniforms was the gold braid Austrian knots on their sleeves. More elaborate braiding indicated higher rank and some knots almost reached the shoulder. However, a general order, issued in 1862, called for the Austrian knots not to be worn in the field, as this made officers conspicuous to enemy combatants.|$|E
5|$|During 1936, the Arab Revolt {{broke out}} in the British Mandate of Palestine. British troops were dispatched, ending {{the first phase of the}} war by the close of the year. Fighting soon resumed and reached its zenith during the summer of 1938. With rising {{tensions}} in Europe, the British began to withdraw troops from Palestine for use elsewhere. The conclusion of the Munich Agreement—on 30September 1938—calmed the rising tensions in Europe and averted war, allowing the British to resume <b>their</b> <b>military</b> build-up in Palestine.|$|E
5|$|Early on, manning {{a castle}} was a feudal duty of vassals to their magnates, and magnates to their kings, however this was later {{replaced}} with paid forces. A garrison was usually commanded by a constable whose peace-time role {{would have been}} looking after the castle in the owner's absence. Under him would have been knights who by benefit of <b>their</b> <b>military</b> training would have acted {{as a type of}} officer class. Below them were archers and bowmen, whose role was to prevent the enemy reaching the walls as can be seen by the positioning of arrowslits.|$|E
