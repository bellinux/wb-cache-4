One in ten officers and one in thirty enlisted men {{were said to have}} been recruited by the Stasi as informers. The Stasi regularly interviewed and maintained files on every guard. Stasi operatives were directly responsible for some aspects of security; passport control stations at crossings were manned by Stasi officers wearing Grenztruppen uniforms.|$|E

Clark was succeeded by Richardson Dilworth, who continued the policies of his predecessor. Dilworth resigned {{to run for governor}} in 1962, and city council president James H. J. Tate was elected as the city's first Irish Catholic mayor. Tate was elected mayor in 1963 and reelected in 1967 despite opposition from reformers who opposed him as an organization insider.|$|E

5|$|Dunbar {{drops out}} of the race due to the {{discovery}} of a meeting she'd had with Goodwin {{a few days before the}} attempt on Underwood's life. Underwood begins planning to maneuver Claire into the VP spot and to use the NSA to illegally obtain voter information and spy on the Republican nominee, Will Conway (Joel Kinnaman). This happens while Underwood and Claire advocate for a controversial gun control bill for the sole purpose of creating an atmosphere divisive enough <b>to</b> <b>weed</b> <b>out</b> potential running mates. During the resulting open convention, Underwood intimidates the front-runner, Secretary of State Catherine Durant (Jayne Atkinson), into surrendering her delegates, and uses the public sympathy from Claire's mother's death to ensure that he and Claire are nominated.|$|E

The talonas was never really trusted by {{the people and the}} ruble was very unstable. Thus, people started using U.S. dollars as a stable currency. Another alternative was the German mark, but it was not available in larger quantities. A lot of shops printed prices in several different currencies, including dollars, and the economy was very “dollarized” as it was legal to make trades in foreign currencies.|$|E

40|$|It {{seems that}} the {{revitalization}} of traditional rituals has been an effective way of developing a new embodiment and identity. The ability of the Canadian Mi'kmaq Indians to rework the cultural body, historically imposed on them by the dominant society, opens the way <b>to</b> <b>weeding</b> <b>out</b> destructive patterns unconsciously or consciously embedded historically in their bodies. The ritual opens up opportunities to explore new habitus and to employ the body in a domain shared with like-minded peers so as to facilitate new ways of approaching the world. The rituals thus provide redemptive opportunities for bodies that have been disempowered by hegemonic contexts, and simultaneously offer social affirmation of the new way {{of being in the}} world...|$|R

25|$|Finances {{probably}} {{recovered in}} the later 14th century and in the following century the abbey was fairly solvent. Revenues from particular estates were earmarked for specific purposes, generating a straightforward budget. The treasurer then had only limited discretion in spending the remainder. This system kept the abbey out of serious trouble for some decades. However, problems had set in again by 1518, when a canonical visitation by Bishop Geoffrey Blythe found debts of 1000 marks, with only 600 marks expected revenue. Blythe also criticised {{the attitude of the}} prior, the abbot's deputy, found that some canons were consorting with women of ill-repute {{and that there was no}} schoolmaster. He advised Abbot Robert Watson <b>to</b> <b>weed</b> <b>out</b> unnecessary staff. This he did and the abbey began to recover financially in its final years.|$|E

Khánh later claimed that he had built up intelligence infrastructure <b>to</b> <b>weed</b> <b>out</b> the Viet Cong under Diệm, but that Minh's MRC had disbanded it and released communist prisoners. Khánh was assisted by Generals Trần Thiện Khiêm, who controlled the forces around Saigon, Đỗ Mậu and Nguyễn Chánh Thi.

25|$|As Chief Minister, Kamaraj {{removed the}} family {{vocation}} based Hereditary Education Policy introduced by Rajaji. The State made immense strides {{in education and}} trade. New schools were opened, so that poor rural students had to walk {{no more than three}} kilometers to their nearest school. Better facilities were added to existing ones. No village remained without a primary school and no panchayat without a high school. Kamaraj strove to eradicate illiteracy by introducing free and compulsory education up to the eleventh standard. He introduced the Midday Meal Scheme to provide at least one meal per day to the lakhs of poor school children ((The Mid-day Meal Scheme, was first introduced in 1920 by the Madras Corporation with the approval of the legislative council, as a breakfast scheme in a corporation school at Thousand Lights, Madras {{for the first time in}} the world)) Later it was expanded to four more schools. This was the precursor to the free noon meal schemes introduced by K. Kamaraj in 1960's and expanded by M. G. Ramachandran in the 1980s.. He introduced free school uniforms <b>to</b> <b>weed</b> <b>out</b> caste, creed and class distinctions among young minds.|$|E

After Burnside's aborted January offensive, Lee moved Mahone's Brigade to United States Ford in early February. The regiments of the brigade took turns standing guard and improving the road back to the Orange Turnpike. Throughout the winter {{efforts were made to}} improve the regiment, now numbering 305. Courts martial were convened to try crimes and Officers Review Boards aspired <b>to</b> <b>weeding</b> <b>out</b> incompetent officers, though the effect of both was to deprive the regiment of officers.

500|$|The {{provisional}} government lacked direction in policy and planning, resulting in it quickly losing control. Minh {{was criticized for}} being lethargic and uninterested in running the country. The number of rural attacks instigated by the Viet Cong surged {{in the wake of}} Diệm's deposal, partly due to the displacement of troops into urban areas for the coup. The increasingly free discussion generated from the surfacing of new and accurate data following the coup revealed that the military situation was far worse than what was reported by Diệm. The incidence of Viet Cong attacks continued to increase as it had done during 1963, the weapons loss ratio worsened and the rate of Viet Cong defections fell. The units that participated in the coup were returned to the field to guard against a possible major communist offensive in the countryside. The falsification and inflation of military statistics by Diệm's officials had led to miscalculations, which manifested themselves in military setbacks after Diệm's death. Khánh claimed that [...] "After the November coup, there was much relaxation, wining and dining, and little prosecution of the war effort."

Before the late 1960s, it was possible to conceal that a relative had bad songbun; however, the ancestry of all citizens was thoroughly checked starting with a 1966 census.

Kim Il-sung, afraid that Beijing would also interfere in his country, whether by invading or sponsoring a coup d'état (Chinese soldiers had been sent previously on [...] "provocative incursions" [...] into Korea), aimed to increase internal security by classifying his citizens.
