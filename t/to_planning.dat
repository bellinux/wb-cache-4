5|$|After Gemini 7, Kraft {{stepped back}} from his work at Mission Control, {{allowing}} other flight directors {{to take charge of}} the remaining missions so that he could devote more time <b>to</b> <b>planning</b> for the Apollo program. He served on two review boards at North American Aviation, the contractor responsible for the Apollo capsule. Yet Kraft still felt pangs at not being {{at the center of the}} action, particularly after the emergency re-entry of Gemini 8. Both astronauts and mission controllers had made the right decisions, but, as Kraft confessed to Robert Gilruth, he found himself wishing that he had been the one on the spot.|$|E

The results of multiple regression analysis suggest that individuals who are higher in openness, locomotion, individualism, and attention to the future are likely to display a high propensity <b>to</b> <b>plan.</b> Previous research on propensity <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> has focused on predicting outcomes, the current study’s focus in on predicting propensity <b>to</b> <b>plan...</b>|$|R

Following the storm, workers made emergency repairs to the destroyed bridges and roads. The cost for rebuilding roads was higher than their damage cost due <b>to</b> <b>planning</b> for future flooding. Within a month, there were repairs to the power grid {{to a level of}} 550MW, or 91.7% of what it was before Mitch struck.

5|$|The Allied {{story for}} FUSAG {{was that the}} army group, based in {{south-east}} England, would invade the Pas-de-Calais region several weeks after a smaller diversionary landing in Normandy.

As D-Day approached, the LCS moved on <b>to</b> <b>planning</b> tactical deceptions to help cover {{the progress of the}} real invasion forces. As well as naval operations, the LCS also planned operations involving paratroopers and ground deceptions. The latter would come into effect once landings were made but the former (involving naval, air and special forces units) were used to cover the approach of the true invasion fleet.|$|E

The missions completed determine which one of ten possible endings will be seen after Shadow collects all the Chaos Emeralds and defeats one of the game's final bosses. The possible ending events range from planning to defeat the Black Arms <b>to</b> <b>planning</b> to destroy the planet.|$|E

5|$|As {{with most}} of the other GNP stations, the station {{building}} was designed by Leslie Green, though at Holborn the station frontage was, uniquely, constructed in stone rather than the standard red glazed terracotta. This was due <b>to</b> <b>planning</b> regulations imposed by the London County Council which required the use of stone for façades in Kingsway. The station entrance and exit sections of the street façade were constructed in granite with the other parts of the ground and first floors in the same style, but using Portland stone. The rest of the building above first floor level was constructed contemporaneously with the station. Access to the platform levels of the station was provided by trapezium-shaped electric lifts manufactured by Otis in America. These operated in pairs in shared circular shafts, with an escape stair in a separate, smaller shaft.|$|E

5|$|Elphinstone {{turned his}} {{attention}} <b>to</b> <b>planning</b> operations against the Dutch East Indies and the French island base of Île de France. He sailed for Madras in his flagship HMS Monarch to take command of the East Indies Station, but maintained a strong garrison and naval presence at the Cape under Sir James Henry Craig and Commodore John Blankett. Much of his squadron was subsequently dispersed on operations across the Indian Ocean. While Elphinstone was consolidating his position, the Batavian government determined to recapture the Cape. A squadron was prepared {{under the command of}} Rear-Admiral Engelbertus Lucas, who had sailed to the East Indies once in 1786, but otherwise had no experience of long expeditionary campaigns. His force comprised two small 66-gun ships of the line, Dortrecht and Revolutie, and five smaller warships. After taking the Cape, Lucas was to continue his expedition in order to reinforce the Dutch East Indies.|$|E
