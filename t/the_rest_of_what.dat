5|$|After a quiet {{period in}} February 1945 {{absorbing}} replacements, the division was {{withdrawn from the}} defensive line and ordered to recapture Trier from the US Army. This attack started on 7 March in freezing conditions but after limited success a fresh US offensive struck the division and forced them back north of Mainz. By 19 March, Raithel's regiment had {{been converted into a}} kampfgruppe (battlegroup) consisting of two gebirgsjäger battalions, a mountain artillery battalion, a pioneer company and eight anti-tank guns. Two weeks later they were fighting their way out of encirclement near Limburg. On 1 April 1945, Kampfgruppe Raithel and <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> remained of the division drove east. Shortly afterwards, Raithel received a serious head wound and was captured. The remnants of the division disintegrated {{over the next few days}} and weeks and were captured by the Americans.|$|E

These lines are followed by the lines published in the Morning Post, which make up lines 121–271a. The poem is concluded with a series of fragments from Joan of Ark Book II that make up <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he wrote for the epic.|$|E

50|$|I’ve {{basically}} devoted {{my career}} {{to looking at}} the relationship between humans and nature. I {{want to do what}} I can to shift human understanding of who we are and what we are and how we should relate to all <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>what’s</b> on this planet. I want to crack through the veneer of the illusions that surround us and see inside reality more purely than you normally get to see. That’s the real witchcraft and voodoo of this artistic process we’re in. I hope that the work helps people to think and see differently—and ultimately, we can only hope, behave differently.|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{graduation}} Spurr {{was hired}} to design menswear for Yves Saint Laurent, working under acclaimed designer Hedi Slimane. He recounted working with Slimane in a 2010 interview: “One of the strongest memories I remember from working with Hedi, was him telling us to throw away the ‘trend books’ that are often used as guidance for younger designers. Set vision, don’t follow trend.” This left a lasting influence on the designer's approach to design: [...] "I appreciate, I look, I listen, {{but on the whole}} I completely disengage from <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> going on in fashion. I have a feeling, an emotion, that comes out in the form of clothes." ...|$|R
25|$|Aleppo {{became part}} of the Ottoman Empire in 1516, when the city had around 50,000 inhabitants, or 11,224 {{households}} according to an Ottoman census. It was the centre of the Aleppo Eyalet; <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> later became Syria was part of either the eyalets of Damascus, Tripoli, Sidon or Raqqa. Following the Ottoman provincial reform of 1864 Aleppo became the centre of the newly constituted Vilayet of Aleppo in 1866.|$|E
25|$|Oranyan, {{the first}} oba (king) of Oyo, was succeeded by Oba Ajaka, Alaafin of Oyo. Ajaka was deposed, because he lacked Yoruba {{military}} virtue and allowed his sub-chiefs too much independence. Leadership was then conferred upon Ajaka's brother, Shango, who was later {{defined as the}} deity of thunder and lightning. Ajaka was restored after Sango's death. Ajaka returned to the throne thoroughly more warlike and oppressive. His successor, Kori, managed to conquer <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> later historians would refer to as metropolitan Oyo.|$|E
25|$|The first Somali {{state to}} be granted its {{independence}} from colonial powers was Somaliland, a former British protectorate that gained independence on 26 June 1960. <b>The</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{came to be known}} as Somali Republic was under Italian rule under the title Trust Territory of Somaliland (also known as Somalia Italiana). Shortly after Somaliland gained independence, it was to form a hasty union with its southern neighbour to create the Somali Republic. Henceforth British Somaliland was referred to as the northern (or north western) region of the Somali Republic, whilst the former Italian colonial state was referred to as the south.|$|E

25|$|Historically {{home to the}} Chumash and Tongva, Los Angeles was {{claimed by}} Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo for Spain in 1542 along with <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> would become Alta California. The city was officially founded on September 4, 1781, by Spanish {{governor}} Felipe de Neve. It {{became a part of}} Mexico in 1821 following the Mexican War of Independence. In 1848, {{at the end of the}} Mexican–American War, Los Angeles and the rest of California were purchased as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, thereby becoming part of the United States. Los Angeles was incorporated as a municipality on April 4, 1850, five months before California achieved statehood. The discovery of oil in the 1890s brought rapid growth to the city. The completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, delivering water from Eastern California, later assured the city's continued rapid growth.|$|E
25|$|Queens {{played a}} minor {{role in the}} American Revolution, as {{compared}} to Brooklyn, where the Battle of Long Island was largely fought. Queens, like <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> became New York City and Long Island, remained under British occupation after the Battle of Long Island in 1776 and was occupied {{throughout most of the}} rest of the Revolutionary War. Under the Quartering Act, British soldiers used, as barracks, the public inns and uninhabited buildings belonging to Queens residents. Even though many local people were against unannounced quartering, sentiment throughout the county remained in favor of the British crown. The quartering of soldiers in private homes, except in times of war, was banned by the Third Amendment to the United States Constitution. Nathan Hale was captured by the British on the shore of Flushing Bay in Queens before being executed by hanging in Manhattan for gathering intelligence.|$|E
500|$|Thus, Characters of Shakespear's Plays was born. Considerable {{material}} {{that he had}} already worked up in his drama reviews was incorporated into the book. One essay, on A Midsummer Night's Dream, was taken entire from a contribution to [...] "The Round Table" [...] series in the Examiner, first published on 26 November 1815, with a concluding paragraph tacked on from a drama review, also published in the Examiner, on 21 January 1816. There was material from other essays. Most of [...] "Shakespear's Exact Discrimination of Nearly Similar Characters" [...] (the Examiner, 12 May 1816) made {{its way into the}} chapters on King Henry IV, King Henry VI, and Othello. Portions of [...] "Shakespear's Female Characters" [...] (the Examiner, 28 July 1816) found a place in the chapters on Cymbeline and Othello. Hazlitt filled out <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he needed to make a complete book in 1816 and possibly early 1817.|$|E

2500|$|Still another {{possible}} linguistic source for [...] "Gullah" [...] are the Dyula ethnic group of West Africa, from whom the American Gullah might be partially descended. The Dyula civilization {{had a large}} territory that stretched from Senegal through Mali to Burkina Faso and <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was French West Africa. These were vast savanna lands with lower population densities. Slave raiding was easier and more common here than in forested areas with natural forms of physical defenses. The word [...] "Dyula" [...] is pronounced [...] "Gwullah" [...] {{among members of the}} Akan ethnic group in Ghana and Cote D'Ivoire.

25|$|With {{the help}} of Motown sales {{executive}} Barney Ales, Harry Balk got the song released to record stores, sending 100,000 copies of the song without Gordy's knowledge, on January 17, 1971, with another 100,000 copies sent after that success. Upon its release, the song became a hit and was Motown's fastest-selling single at the time, peaking at number 1 on the Hot Soul Singles Chart, and peaking at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. Gordy {{was stunned by the}} news and drove to Gaye's home to discuss him making a complete album, stating Gaye could do what he wanted with his music if he finished the record within 30 days before the end of March and thus effectively giving him the right to produce his own albums. Gaye returned to Hitsville to record <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>What's</b> Going On, which took a mere ten business days between March 1 and March 10.
