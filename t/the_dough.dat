25|$|The {{ingredients}} to make dried pasta usually include water and semolina flour; egg for colour and richness (in {{some types of}} pasta), and possibly vegetable juice (such as spinach, beet, tomato, carrot), herbs or spices for colour and flavour. After mixing semolina flour with warm water <b>the</b> <b>dough</b> is kneaded mechanically until it becomes firm and dry.

Next, <b>the</b> <b>dough</b> is processed in a steamer to kill any bacteria it may contain.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{knowledge}} of the properties of model food systems is essential for designing new products with desired functionality. In order to address this issue, {{the present study was}} focused on mixtures consisting of 85 % potato starch and 15 % powdered eggs, gluten or soy protein concentrates. The nature of the proteins used in admixture with starch had a decisive role on the rheological properties of the batters and thermo-mechanical behavior of <b>the</b> <b>doughs.</b> <b>The</b> fundamental rheology tests indicated a solid like behavior with a strong cross-linked network for admixtures of starch with either gluten or soy, while starch - powdered egg batter showed a weak liquid like behavior. Observations made on gelling process highlighted the narrowed gelling temperatures domains for starch when mixed with proteins. Also protein addition determined the occurrence of a second inflection region in G‘curves associated with protein denaturation. The profile of the Mixolab curves varied with the type of protein, indicating low stability of <b>the</b> <b>doughs</b> and rather poor water holding capacity at kneading, especially in case of the powdered egg containing sample. The soy proteins exhibited the highest ability to retain water while heating <b>the</b> <b>doughs.</b> <b>The</b> interference of the protein products with starch granules swelling and gelatinization at thermal treatment depended on their composition, structural properties and thermal stability. The highest stability at 90 °C was registered for the sample with soy protein, whereas the gluten containing mixture exhibited the lowest tendency of starch retrogradation...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of ozone in doughs and breads made with ozonated water. Different treatments were analyzed, control with an improver that included ascorbic acid (CM), control without improver (C) and 4 different doses of ozone in water: Oz 1 (0. 47 - 0. 48 ppm); Oz 2 (0. 64 - 0. 68 ppm); Oz 3 (0. 89 - 0. 91 ppm); Oz 4 (> 2 ppm). The results have shown that high doses of ozone (Oz 4) in <b>the</b> <b>doughs</b> caused a decrease in the maximum height of <b>the</b> <b>doughs</b> during fermentation (Hm, measured with a Rheofermentometer) and in their alveograhic properties strength (W) and tenacity (P), causing a decrease in their ability to maintain the desired shape (height and lenght) of the bread. This might be due to excessive oxidation of gluten proteins. Furthermore, the breads obtained from these doughs showed higher values in hardness, gumminess, chewiness and a lower cohesiveness values and, after 24 h, a faster staling process than the control breads. Medium doses of ozone in water (0. 30 - 0. 80 ppm) provided bread more similar than control samples for texture properties. Beside this, it was observed that the kneading time could be decreased because the development time of <b>the</b> <b>doughs</b> made with ozone was faster than controls. Varying this kneading time (using 0. 80 ppm ozonated water) it was found that Hm in doughs, height and length as well as hardness, gumminess, chewiness and cohesiveness at 0 and 24 h of the bread resembled those of <b>the</b> <b>doughs</b> and control breads kneading with standard times. The results of this work indicate that the use of ozonated water may be a useful alternative to the addition of chemical oxidants to <b>the</b> bread <b>dough.</b> For this to be effective, it seems to be necessary to use moderate doses of ozone and adjust the intensity and time of dough mixing.

The findings of the programme are used to validate corresponding numerical simulations carried out at UW Swansea, with the eventual aim of improving <b>the</b> understanding of <b>dough</b> mixing. Simple idealized dough mixtures, including bread, biscuit and bagel type doughs, are first characterized rheologically in terms of shear viscosity, dynamic moduli and extensional viscosity, to provide a context for the peeling work.
