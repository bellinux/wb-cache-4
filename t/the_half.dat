5|$|After the Olympics, Zersenay {{returned}} to Eritrea and trained {{for one month}} {{to prepare for the}} 2008 World Half Marathon Championships in Rio de Janeiro. He won his third consecutive title over <b>the</b> <b>half</b> marathon distance with ease, taking the lead early on and beating the second-placed Patrick Makau Musyoki by almost two minutes. His success caused much celebration in his home country, {{so much so that the}} President of Eritrea greeted him at the airport upon his return. With a strong history in <b>the</b> <b>half</b> marathon, Zersenay announced he would try the full marathon distance the following season.|$|E

5|$|CSKA kicked-off {{the first}} half of extra-time. Five minutes into <b>the</b> <b>half,</b> Liverpool {{substitute}} Sinama Pongolle was booked. With two minutes of <b>the</b> <b>half</b> remaining, the ball was played into the centre of the CSKA half; Ignashevich misjudged the flight of the ball, which went over his head and fell to Cissé. His subsequent shot was saved by Akinfeev, but the ball rebounded to Cissé who scored to give Liverpool a 2–1 lead. <b>The</b> <b>half</b> was brought to an end with Liverpool leading {{for the first time in}} the match. Liverpool kicked-off the second half of extra-time. CSKA had the first chance of <b>the</b> <b>half,</b> but Vágner Love's effort was easily saved by Reina. Liverpool responded midway through the half; Cissé's cross from the right side of the pitch was met by García, who scored. No further goals were scored and the referee blew for full-time with the final score 3–1 to Liverpool.|$|E
