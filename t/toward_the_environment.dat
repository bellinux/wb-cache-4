5|$|An individual's {{belief that}} an {{environmental}} claim lacks honesty {{can have a}} negative effect on attitude toward a brand. If, on the other side, the consumer grants credibility to the claim, the individual will behave more respectfully <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> The problem in extending that credibility to a brand is that consumers interested in ecological products generally are skeptical of commercial advertisements. This skepticism is due to various factors such as lack of language, the absence of scientific knowledge necessary to interpret advertising meaning, and, in particular, the falsehoods and exaggeration of some advertising techniques. To resolve this problem, independent organizations may choose to guarantee messages on the environmental benefits of brands with environmental labeling systems sponsored by independent organizations. This practice tries to diminish perceived biases in environmental information by promoting standardization of the information with the aim of improving confidence in the evaluation of environmental benefits of products—all of which should positively affect the purchase intention.|$|E
25|$|Each {{cremation}} uses about 28 {{gallons of}} fuel and releases about 540 pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Thus, the roughly 1 million bodies that are cremated annually in the United States produce ~270,000 tons of carbon dioxide. That’s more CO2 pollution than 22,000 average American homes generate in a year. The environmental impact may be reduced by using cremators for longer periods, and not cremating {{on the same day}} as the coffin is received, which reduces the use of fossil fuel and hence carbon emissions. Cremation is therefore becoming more friendly <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> though natural burials are also possible. Some funeral and crematorium owners offer a carbon neutral funeral service incorporating efficient-burning coffins made from lightweight recycled composite board.|$|E
25|$|Under Gorbachev's leadership, the {{official}} attitude <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> changed. Various {{social and economic}} factors helped produce this change. To maintain economic growth through the 1980s, {{a period in which}} the labor force had been declining significantly, intensive and more prudent use of both natural and human resources was required. At the same time, glasnost' provided an outlet for widespread discussion of environmental issues, and a genuine grass-roots ecological movement arose to champion causes similar to the ecological concerns of the West. Public campaigns were mounted to protect Lake Baykal from industrial pollution and to halt the precipitous decline in the water levels of the Caspian Sea, the Sea of Azov, and, most urgently, the Aral Sea. A grandiose scheme to divert the northern rivers southward had been counted on to replenish these seas, but for both economic and environmental reasons, the project was canceled in 1986.|$|E
40|$|A {{questionnaire}} {{was administered to}} fourth grade, seventh grade, {{and high school students}} in Marion, Indiana to attempt to determine the following: 1) To what extent will grade levels that appear to be highly superstitious show favorable response to questions concerning their feelings <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> natural <b>environment</b> or nature-related activities? 2) To what extent will grade levels that appear to have little or no belief in superstitions show favorable response to questions concerning their feelings <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> natural <b>environment</b> or nature-related activities? 3) To what extent will the superstitiousness of any particular school grade level(s) differ from the superstitiousness of any other school grade levels used in this study? Results of this research indicate that the fourth grade students surveyed differed significantly from students of the seventh and tenth-twelfth grade levels in both superstitiousness and in their feelings <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> natural <b>environment.</b> Fourth grade students were found to be more superstitious about nature and have more negative feelings <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> natural <b>environment</b> than either of the other experimental groups studied.

40|$|These days, {{the reality}} of {{environmental}} crises creates grave doubts {{about the future of}} <b>the</b> natural <b>environment.</b> Many believe that if present human behavior <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> natural <b>environment</b> continues, there will be no hope for a sustainable life. Therefore, it is vital that human behavior toward nature be modified and corrected. Although, ethic is traditionally concerned about relations between individuals, but it is getting more attention for modifying human behavior in order to correct human-nature interaction and establish a well-intentioned one. In this respect, we need science of ecology and ethics together. Ecology helps us to understand natural ecosystems and respective regulations and laws, whereas ethics teach us how to define right and wrong behaviors <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> natural <b>environment.</b> This research discusses some possible relationships that might exist between ecology and ethics toward nature conservation...|$|R
500|$|Despite the {{bipartisan}} goodwill and declarations {{of the importance}} of the Everglades, the region still remains in danger. Political maneuvering continues to impede CERP: sugar lobbyists promoted a bill in the Florida legislature in 2003 that increased the acceptable amount of phosphorus in Everglades waterways from 10ppb to 15ppb and extended the deadline for the mandated decrease by 20years. A compromise of 2016 was eventually reached. Environmental organizations express concern that attempts to speed up some of the construction through Acceler8 are politically motivated; the six projects Acceler8 focuses on do not provide more water to natural areas in desperate need of it, but rather to projects in populated areas bordering the Everglades, suggesting that water is being diverted to make room for more people in an already overtaxed environment. Though Congress promised half the funds for restoration, after the War in Iraq began and two of CERP's major supporters in Congress retired, the federal role in CERP was [...] left unfulfilled. According to a story in The New York Times, state officials say the restoration is lost in a maze of [...] "federal bureaucracy, a victim of 'analysis paralysis' [...] ". In 2007, the release of $2billion for Everglades restoration was approved by Congress, overriding President George W. Bush's veto of the entire Water Development Project the money was a part of. [...] Bush's rare veto went against the wishes of Florida Republicans, including his brother, Governor Jeb Bush. A lack of subsequent action by the Congress prompted Governor Charlie Crist to travel to Washington D.C. in February 2008 and inquire about the promised funds. By June 2008, the federal government had spent only $400million of the $7.8billion legislated. Carl Hiaasen characterized George W. Bush's attitude <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> as [...] "long-standing indifference" [...] in June 2008, exemplified when Bush stated he would not intervene to change the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) policy allowing the release of water polluted with fertilizers and phosphorus into the Everglades.|$|E

40|$|Neuroimaging {{studies have}} {{frequently}} observed relatively high activity in medial rostral prefrontal cortex (PFC) during rest or baseline conditions. Some accounts have attributed this high activity to {{the occurrence of}} unconstrained stimulus-independent and task-unrelated thought processes during baseline conditions. Here, the authors investigated the alternative possibility that medial rostral PFC supports attention <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> external <b>environment</b> during low-demand conditions. Participants performed a baseline simple reaction time (RT) task, along with 3 other tasks that differed in the requirement to attend to external stimuli versus stimulus-independent thought. Medial rostral PFC activation was observed in the baseline task and in a condition requiring strong engagement with external stimuli, relative to 2 conditions with a greater requirement for stimulus-independent thought. An important finding was that activity in this region was associated with faster RTs in the baseline task, ruling out an explanation in terms of task-unrelated thought processes during this condition. Thus, at least under certain circum-stances, medial rostral PFC appears to support attention <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> external <b>environment,</b> facilitating performance in situations {{that do not require}} extensive processing of experimental stimuli...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the direct impact of three dimensions of <b>the</b> institutional <b>environment</b> on managerial attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> natural <b>environment</b> and <b>the</b> direct {{influence of the}} latter on the environmental sustainability orientation (ESO) of small firms. We contend that when <b>the</b> institutional <b>environment</b> is perceived by owner–managers as supportive of sound natural environment management practices, {{they are more likely}} to develop a positive attitude toward natural environment issues and concerns. Such owner–manager attitudes are likely to lead to a positive and proactive orientation of their firms <b>toward</b> environmental sustainability. <b>The</b> study uses survey data from 166 small manufacturing firms located in three Philippine cities. First, the study develops and tests the measurement models to examine the validity of the constructs representing <b>the</b> firm’s institutional <b>environment,</b> managerial attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> natural <b>environment</b> and <b>the</b> ESO of firms. Second, the study develops and tests the structural models examining the institutional environment–managerial attitudes–ESO linkages. Multi-sample invariance structural model analysis shows the mediating role of managerial attitudes in the institutional environment–ESO nexus. The findings show that ESO is a construct comprising three dimensions: knowledge of environmental issues, sustainable practices and commitment <b>toward</b> environmental sustainability. <b>The</b> cognitive, regulatory and normative elements of <b>the</b> institutional <b>environment</b> are strongly linked to positive managerial attitudes toward environmental sustainability, which in turn, positively influences the firm’s overall ESO.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to examine how employeesʼ {{personal}} ethics, expressed through their personal values and attitudes toward social and environmental issues, are associated with the ethics of organizations in public administration. The authors introduce their own theoretical model that examines the relations between employeesʼ personal ethics - expressed through employeesʼ personal values and attitudes toward natural and social <b>environments</b> - and <b>the</b> ethics of public administration. The reported study examined these relations and tested a proposed model based on the answers of 212 employees from public administration organizations in Slovenia. Employeesʼ attitudes toward natural and social <b>environments</b> and <b>the</b> ethics of their organizations were measured using a questionnaire designed to measure aspects of ethics whereas personal values were measured using the Schwartz value survey. The results demonstrated that employeesʼ self-enhancing values significantly influence their attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> natural <b>environment.</b> Employeesʼ self-transcendence and self-enhancement values significantly influence their attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> social <b>environment</b> and <b>the</b> ethics of organizations. In addition, research results about the mediation effect of employeesʼ attitudes toward natural and social <b>environments</b> on <b>the</b> association between the employeesʼ personal values and their perception of the ethics of public administration organizations reveals that employeesʼ social attitudes have a significant impact on the ethics of public administration while the impact of self-transcending and self-enhancing values becomes insignificant. Based on results of testing our model we can conclude that <b>the</b> employeeʼs attitudes <b>toward</b> to <b>the</b> social <b>environment</b> represent a significantly more powerful predictor of ethics in public administration organizations than the employeesʼ personal values. These results present a solid basis for further theoretical and practical advancement of public administration ethics...|$|R
