25|$|Johns' {{breakthrough}} move, {{which was}} to inform much later work by others, was to appropriate popular iconography for painting, thus allowing a set of familiar associations to answer the need for subject. Though the abstract expressionists disdained subject matter, {{it could be argued}} that in the end, they had simply changed subjects. Johns neutralized the subject, so <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> a pure painted surface could declare itself. For twenty years after Johns painted Flag, the surface could suffice – for example, in Andy Warhol's silkscreens, or in Robert Irwin's illuminated ambient works.|$|E
25|$|Cicero’s {{case was}} divided into three parts. The first part {{detailed}} exactly the charge brought by Ericius. Cicero explained how a rustic son of a farmer, who lives off the pleasures of his own land, would not have gained anything from committing patricide because he would have eventually inherited his father's land anyway. The second part concerned the boldness and greed {{of two of the}} accusers, Magnus and Capito. Cicero told the jury that they were the more likely perpetrators of murder because the two were greedy, both for conspiring together against a fellow kinsman and, in particular, Magnus, for his boldness and for being unashamed to appear in court to support the false charges. The third part explained that Chrysogonus had immense political power, and the accusation was successfully made due to that power. Even though Chrysogonus may not have been what Cicero said he was, through rhetoric Cicero successfully made him appear to be a foreign freed man who prospered by devious means {{in the aftermath of the}} civil war. Cicero surmised that it showed what kind of a person he was and <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> murder was not beneath him.|$|E
500|$|The result kept Burton in {{the lead}} in the Drivers' Championship. After the race, Jeff Gordon (who was {{involved}} in the lap-137 accident) was less optimistic about his championship chances: [...] "This pretty much does it for us as far as I'm concerned for the championship. You knew exactly <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> that was going to happen." [...] In the Manufacturers' Championship Chevrolet increased its point total to 231; Dodge moved into second place with 180 and Ford was a close third with 179. The race took three hours, ten minutes and twenty-three seconds to complete; because it ended under caution, no margin of victory was recorded.|$|E

According to Benson, both he and Mosley were moved to tears by the session and Benson felt <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> that does not happen often in a recording studio. In a separate session with Mosley, bassist Tai Anderson said that, after recording the end of the song [...] "Run to You", Mosley said she could not believe she was recording with the band. Concerned that Mosley might have been pressured by her management team into doing the collaboration, Anderson said they told Mosley that she didn't have to do the recording. Mosley assuaged their concerns by telling the band that she was actually excited to be able to perform on their album as the band's music had helped her during a difficult period in her teenage years.|$|E

2500|$|The lemma {{is called}} [...] "diagonal" [...] because it bears some {{resemblance}} to Cantor's diagonal argument. The terms [...] "diagonal lemma" [...] or [...] "fixed point" [...] {{do not appear}} in Kurt Gödel's 1931 article, or in Tarski (1936). Carnap (1934) {{was the first to}} prove that for any formula F in a theory T satisfying certain conditions, there exists a formula ψ such that ψ↔F(°#(ψ)) is provable in T. Carnap's work was phrased in alternate language, as the concept of [...] computable functions was not yet developed in 1934. Mendelson (1997, p.204) believes that Carnap was the first to state <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> the diagonal lemma was implicit in Gödel's reasoning.

[...] He later added that while in Europe religion is mostly a personal issue, in America it has become very politicized.

2500|$|In a 2005 conference {{presenting}} Daniele Ganser's {{research on}} Gladio, Hans Senn, General Chief of Staff of the Swiss Armed Forces between 1977 and 1980, explained {{how he was}} informed {{of the existence of}} a secret organisation {{in the middle of his}} term of office. According to him, it already became clear in 1980 in the wake of the Schilling/Bachmann affair that there was also a secret group in Switzerland. But former MP, Helmut Hubacher, President of the Social Democratic Party from 1975 to 1990, declared that although it had been known that [...] "special services" [...] existed within the army, as a politician he never at any time could have known that P-26 was behind this. Hubacher pointed out that the President of the parliamentary investigation into P26 (PUK-EMD), the right-wing politician from Appenzell and member of the Council of States for that Canton, Carlo Schmid, had suffered [...] "like a dog" [...] during the commission's investigations. Carlo Schmid declared to the press: [...] "I was shocked <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> that is at all possible," [...] and said to the press he was glad to leave the [...] "conspirational atmosphere" [...] which had weighted upon him like a [...] "black shadow" [...] during the investigations. Hubacher found it especially disturbing that, apart from its official mandate of organizing resistance in case of a Soviet invasion, P-26 had also a mandate to become active should the left succeed in achieving a parliamentary majority.|$|E
2500|$|In 1925, Jeacocke was {{involved}} in another incident, the details of which are vague. Surrey played Essex County Cricket Club at Leyton Cricket Ground. The rules for the time at which the lunch interval began had just been standardised, and Fender rejected a request from the Essex captain, Johnny Douglas, to keep the old time for the interval on the Leyton ground, preferring to [...] "stick to MCC rules". This possibly aggravated what followed, and during this period Fender and Douglas had a difficult relationship. After two days' play, Surrey had scored 431 and Essex had replied with 333 for seven wickets. Before {{the third and final}} day, one of the umpires informed the captains that none of Surrey's professional players had arrived in time for the start of play. Douglas refused to postpone the start, stating [...] "Strict MCC rules, Fender—the side refusing to play loses the match." [...] Fender elected to continue, and when play began, only he and Jeacocke were present and these two went out to field alone. They had driven to the ground together, while the professionals were delayed in traffic. The Essex batsmen, possibly embarrassed by their captain's stance, did not appear until Fender sent a message saying that he could claim victory in the match if they did not come out to bat. They did so, and Fender and Jeacocke bowled from opposite ends until the remainder of the team arrived. The two men bowled wide and the batsmen made no attempt to score. Later in the day, the crowd jeered Fender for refusing to declare his innings closed, unaware of what had passed earlier. Whether the press were unaware of what happened, or if they agreed to keep it quiet, the incident was not reported, although several accounts hinted that something unusual had occurred. The play which took place was not recorded by the match scorers until the full Surrey team arrived, but several players who took part remembered it happening. In later years, rumours persisted <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> it had taken place.|$|E
2500|$|Bianca's {{most notable}} initial storyline upon her return was a {{paedophilia}} plot revolving around Bianca's partner Tony King (Chris Coghill), and her 15 year old step daughter, Whitney. According to the Daily Mail, the storyline {{has been dubbed}} as the [...] "most controversial story-line on the show ever". The idea for the storyline was conceptualised by writer Simon Ashdown and other scriptwriters, when they were brainstorming ideas for Bianca's return to EastEnders. They had seen a documentary about homelessness and had been struck by {{an image of a}} woman and child at a bus stop with nowhere to go, a scene that was used to similar effect in Bianca and her family's return episode. They considered the homeless family's predicament and were left pondering [...] "What might happen to them? They would be easy prey... What if a paedophile noticed the child, who might be, say, 12, and pretended to be the woman's saviour? She would be too grateful to notice that this was unusual behaviour, that he seemed to have few friends or family". They pitched the idea to John Yorke, controller of BBC drama production, who said that [...] "It drew a sharp intake of breath. Most EastEnders stories that have been good and successful have been the ones that caused the sharp intake of breath, so they're always the kind of stories you look for." [...] However, paedophilia as a storyline had been pitched before, but the idea had been vetoed because they could not find the right storyline and characters to proceed and, as the topic was so controversial, producers had been unwilling to take the risk. Diederick Santer commented, [...] "We knew <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> 16% of under-16s have been sexually abused at some point, but if you can't find a story, it's an issue that sits there, dead, on the show." [...] It has been noted in the media that paedophilia is a subject rarely shown on pre-watershed terrestrial television, and although EastEnders had broached it in 2001 with Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) and her abusive uncle Harry (Michael Elphick), this was scripted to have happened in the past and focused on the effect it had on the victim as an adult.|$|E
