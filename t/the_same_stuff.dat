500|$|While calling Undone MercyMe's [...] "most satisfying" [...] {{record to}} date, Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today {{regarded}} the songwriting as [...] "monotonous" [...] {{and felt that}} MercyMe was [...] "beginning to sound like they're repeating themselves". Josh Taylor of Jesus Freak Hideout gave the album three out of five stars, opining that [...] "Frankly, this is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>stuff</b> they were doing three years and two albums ago... If you’re a diehard MercyMe fan, this disc will be music to your ears. But {{for those of us}} who long for change (Not drastic ones, mind you. But small, significant ones.), Undone seems redundant. It’s still good, but it’s beginning to become stale".|$|E
500|$|He also said, [...] "I {{was pretty}} much left alone for two days, and I let [...] in at the end. I played her [...] song by song, and she'd burst into tears. 'Oh! It's so beautiful!', 'Oh, it's so beautiful!' You know, this is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>stuff</b> that people tell me, 'Oh! It's so suicidal!'" [...] The {{original}} release of The Marble Index included eight of 12 songs Nico recorded. [...] "Roses in the Snow", [...] "Nibelungen", [...] "Sagen die Gelehrten" [...] and [...] "Reve Reveiller" [...] were left off the album. The finished album was barely 30 minutes long, which [...] "was as much apparently as Frazier Mohawk, mixing and sequencing it, could stand without starting to feel suicidal".|$|E
500|$|Hillcourt {{was among}} the few on the National Staff who {{strongly}} resisted the change to the Wood Badge program. He attended the presentation that Larson made to the national Scout committee on the new Wood Badge curriculum. Larson later reported, [...] "He fought us all the way... He had {{a vested interest in}} what had been and resisted every change. I just told him to settle down, {{everything was going to be}} all right." [...] Hillcourt presented an alternative to Larson's plan to incorporate leadership into Wood Badge. Chief Scout Executive Joseph Brunton asked Larson to look at Hillcourt's plan, and Larson reported back that it was <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>stuff,</b> just reordered and rewritten. Larson's plan for Wood Badge was approved and he moved ahead to begin implementing the proposed changes.|$|E

500|$|In August 2005, when it {{came time}} for Furtado to [...] "lay down the tracks" [...] for her third studio album Loose, she turned to hip hop {{producer}} Timbaland, who she previously collaborated with on the remix to Missy Elliott's [...] "Get Ur Freak On" [...] (2001) and on Ms. Jade's single [...] "Ching Ching" [...] (2002). Interscope Records president Jimmy Iovine played Furtado a few of Timbaland's latest productions, which she responded positively to. According to Furtado, [...] "It sound like he's listening to all <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>stuff</b> as me— everything from System of a Down to Bloc Party and Death from Above 1979, and a lot of Coldplay, too". [...] "Within no time", the two were working on music at The Hit Factory in Miami, Florida, alongside Timbaland's protege Danja. There, they produced ten of Looses thirteen tracks.|$|E
500|$|Coming out of college, Bavaro {{was known}} mostly for his {{blocking}} ability and {{was expected to}} play the role of a run blocking tight end as a professional. He earned the nickname [...] "Rambo" [...] early in his rookie season due to his intense playing style, quiet personality, and physical resemblance to Sylvester Stallone. After starting tight end Zeke Mowatt suffered a season-ending injury before the start of the 1985 season, coach Bill Parcells, who had called Bavaro the most impressive rookie during training camp, installed Bavaro as the starter. Bavaro finished his rookie season with 37 receptions, 511yards, and 4 touchdowns. He also set a team record with 12 receptions in one game during quarterback Phil Simms' 513yard passing effort against the Cincinnati Bengals on October 13, 1985.* [...] , databasefootball.com, accessed May 14, 2007. After the game, which the Giants lost 35–30, Bavaro responded in the low-key manner that would typify his career, [...] "t was nothing special, the plays were <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>stuff.</b> I don't know what they did. I just caught a lot of balls. I'd rather win, that's all." [...] Bavaro was named to the NFL All-Rookie team for his performance during the season.|$|E
500|$|Nicole Perlman, who was {{enrolled}} in Marvel's screenwriting program in 2009, was offered several of their lesser known properties to base a screenplay on. Out of those, Perlman chose Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning's Guardians of the Galaxy, due to her interest in space and science fiction, adding, [...] "I think [...] were a little taken aback when I chose Guardians, because there were ones {{that would make a}} lot more sense if you were a romantic-comedy writer or something like that." [...] Perlman spent two years writing a draft, immersing herself in the Guardians universe, and was asked in late 2011 to create another draft, before Gunn was brought in in early 2012 to contribute to the script. Gunn eventually rewrote the script entirely because [...] "it didn’t work" [...] for him; he would use the film The Dirty Dozen as a reference to convey his ideas of the film to Marvel. Gunn later explained that Perlman's draft was very different from the script he used during filming, including a different story, character arcs and no Walkman; he stated, [...] "In Nicole’s script everything is pretty different... it's not about <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>stuff.</b> But that's how the WGA works. They like first writers an awful lot." [...] In August 2012, Marvel Studios hired writer Chris McCoy to rewrite Perlman's script, however, it is unclear what contribution he had to the final script, since he did not receive production credit.|$|E

2500|$|The {{bands that}} defined and embraced the gothic rock genre {{included}} Bauhaus, [...] early Adam and the Ants, the Cure, the Birthday Party, Southern Death Cult, Specimen, Sex Gang Children, UK Decay, Virgin Prunes, Killing Joke, and the Damned. Near {{the peak of}} this first generation of the gothic scene in 1983, The Face Paul Rambali recalled that there were [...] "several strong Gothic characteristics" [...] in the music of Joy Division. In 1984, Joy Division's bassist Peter Hook named Play Dead {{as one of their}} heirs: [...] "If you listen to a band like Play Dead, who I really like, Joy Division played <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>stuff</b> that Play Dead are playing.

2500|$|Inevitably, Haile Melekot's semi-independent kingdom (the Emperor of Ethiopia in Gondar {{was still}} {{nominally}} the liege {{lord of the}} King of Shewa) {{came to the attention}} of Tewodros II, who was successfully concluding the process of defeating the remaining warlords of Ethiopia and reuniting Ethiopia. Haile Melekot allied himself with the Oromo in the province Wollo, which lay between him and Tewodros, but as Abir notes, he [...] "was not made of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>stuff</b> his father was, and could not provide the same inspiring leadership which had made Showa strong in the past." [...] The Shewan army failed to provide any effective help to the Oromo leaders in Wollo, and with an army of 50,000 men, Tewodros crushed his divided opposition. After a pause for the rainy season, Tewodros then entered northern Shewa in 1855.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{revealed}} {{as early as}} November 2009 that the band were aiming {{to take a new}} direction with the third album, with Cronise explaining that [...] "coming up with eight or nine or 10 different themes [...] every couple years, well, it's a little daunting some times, especially for me personally" [...] and noting that [...] "Given the types of themes we'd covered already, I didn't really want to revisit <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>stuff</b> again on another record and talk about the same things and doom and gloom and sorcerers and ravens and things. So, we just kind of wanted to change it up and do something a little different." [...] Further elaboration was also given on the 'science fiction concept album' idea, with Cronise explaining that [...] "It's psychedelic, in a way. It's not like Star Wars science fiction ... laser guns and action all the time. It's more cerebral in that it's still mythological in the way it's told. It's science fiction and there's spaceships and robots, but it doesn't take place in the future. It's just like another planet far away sort of thing. Otherworldly. And of course, it will have universal-type themes in it. I wanted to create a completely original kind of setting to have the songs take place in." ...|$|E
