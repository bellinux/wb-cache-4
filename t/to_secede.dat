5|$|In {{order to}} foil any {{plans for a}} coup d'état, the {{president}} {{took control of the}} military and police, reducing their numbers from 5,300 to 3,500. Defence was entrusted to the French armed forces that, pursuant to the treaty on defence cooperation of 24 April 1961, were stationed at Port-Bouët and could intervene at Houphouët-Boigny's request or when they considered French interests to be threatened. They subsequently intervened during attempts by the Sanwi monarchists <b>to</b> <b>secede</b> in 1959 and 1969, and again in 1970, when an unauthorised political group, the Eburnian Movement, was formed and Houphouët-Boigny accused its leader Kragbé Gnagbé of wishing <b>to</b> <b>secede.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} March, the {{conflict}} had escalated into the Croatian War of Independence. The JNA stepped in, increasingly supporting the Croatian Serb insurgents and preventing Croatian police from intervening. In early April, {{the leaders of the}} Croatian Serb revolt declared their intention to integrate the area under their control, known as SAO Krajina, with Serbia. The Government of Croatia viewed this declaration as an attempt <b>to</b> <b>secede.</b>|$|E
5|$|In March and April 1991, Serbs in Croatia {{began to}} make moves <b>to</b> <b>secede</b> from that territory. It {{is a matter of}} debate to what extent this move was locally {{motivated}} and to what degree the Milošević-led Serbian government was involved. In any event, the SAO Krajina was declared, which consisted of any Croatian territory with a substantial Serb population. The Croatian government viewed this move as a rebellion.|$|E
5000|$|With {{its members}} of {{different}} Jewish affiliations Jüdische Gemeinde zu Berlin also offered services in its different synagogues following different ceremonial styles. Some followed old style (Alter Ritus), {{such as the}} [...] on Heidereutergasse 4, especially for the members clinging to the so-called intra-community orthodoxy (Gemeindeorthodoxie, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>seceded</b> orthodoxy Austrittsorthodoxie, the proponents of which had seceded from Jüdische Gemeinde zu Berlin establishing Adass Jisroel in 1869).|$|R
50|$|When Horsfall {{returned}} from the United States, the Special Branch was severely short-staffed because of the exodus of easterners <b>to</b> <b>seceding</b> Biafra. This situation thrust a greater workload on him and might in part also account for his rapid rise in the service. Horsfall claims to have been embedded with the federal troops in Opobo, Calabar, Onne, and Port Harcourt; he obviously would have held some advantage in this role because he was indigenous to the area.|$|R

5|$|The {{arrival of}} Ronaldinho in 2003, and Barcelona's {{subsequent}} success in La Liga and Champions League, {{has been seen}} as crucial to an increase in the national, and worldwide, fan-base of the club. This development of a larger national fan-base has created friction between the Catalan nationalist supporters, who wish <b>to</b> <b>secede</b> from Spain, and the club's other Spanish supporters.|$|E
5|$|The city of St. Louis is an {{independent}} city, and is not {{within the limits of}} a county. Its residents voted <b>to</b> <b>secede</b> from St. Louis County in 1876. Throughout the United States, St. Louis is one of three independent cities outside the state of Virginia (the other two are Baltimore, Maryland and Carson City, Nevada).|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the war, Indiana was run by a Democratic and southern sympathetic majority in the state legislature. It was by the actions of Governor Oliver Morton, who illegally borrowed millions of dollars to finance the army, that Indiana could contribute so greatly to the war effort. Morton suppressed the state legislature {{with the help of the}} Republican minority to prevent it from assembling during 1861 and 1862. This prevented any chance the Democrats might have had to interfere with the war effort or to attempt <b>to</b> <b>secede</b> from the Union.|$|E

5|$|Beriah Magoffin (April 18, 1815 – February 28, 1885) was the 21st Governor of Kentucky, serving {{during the}} early part of the Civil War. Personally, Magoffin adhered to a states' rights position, {{including}} the right of a state <b>to</b> <b>secede</b> from the Union, and he sympathized with the Confederate cause. Nevertheless, when the Kentucky General Assembly adopted a position of neutrality in the war, Magoffin ardently held to it, refusing calls for aid from both the Union and Confederate governments.|$|E
5|$|In early 1861, Norfolk voters {{instructed}} their {{delegate to}} vote for secession. Virginia voted <b>to</b> <b>secede</b> from the Union. In the spring of 1862, the Battle of Hampton Roads took place off the northwest shore of the city's Sewell's Point Peninsula, marking the first fight between two ironclads, the USS Monitor and the CSS Virginia. The battle ended in a stalemate, but {{changed the course of}} naval warfare; from then on, warships were fortified with metal.|$|E
5|$|Lorković was a keen {{advocate}} for the amalgamation of all Croatian parties into a 'super-party' <b>to</b> <b>secede</b> from the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and on 4 October 1934 swore his Ustaše oath. He became commander of all Ustaše units in Germany and later, after the assassination of King Alexander, commander of all Ustaše outside Italy. The assassination of King Alexander led to him being briefly detained in Germany, but was released in mid-1935 after a German court rejected a Yugoslav request for his extradition.|$|E

5|$|Magoffin {{was elected}} {{governor}} of Kentucky {{by a vote}} of 76,187 to 67,283 over Joshua Fry Bell, taking office on August 30, 1859. He supported states' rights and the institution of slavery. Although he believed in the right of states <b>to</b> <b>secede</b> from the union, he hoped to avoid this outcome by reaching an agreement between the southern and northern states. To that end, he wrote a circular letter to the governors of the slave states on December 9, 1860 detailing a plan to save the Union.|$|E
5|$|The town {{voted in}} October 2007 <b>to</b> <b>secede</b> {{from the region}} of Veneto and join the {{neighbouring}} region, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol. This was motivated by improved cultural ties with the small Ladin-speaking community in South Tyrol and the attraction of lower taxes. The referendum is not executive and a final decision on the matter can only be taken by law of the Italian parliament with consent of both regional councils of Veneto and Trentino-Alto Adige.|$|E
5|$|An {{autonomous}} oblast {{during the}} Soviet era {{under the jurisdiction}} of the Azerbaijan SSR, Nagorno-Karabakh's population was approximately 75% ethnic Armenian. As the Soviet Union's disintegration approached during the late 1980s, the enclave's government expressed its desire <b>to</b> <b>secede</b> and unite with the neighboring Armenian SSR. By 1991, Armenia and Azerbaijan were independent countries but the nascent Nagorno-Karabakh Republic remained internationally unrecognized despite its government's declaration of independence. Small-scale violence had flared up between the two ethnic groups in February 1988 but soon escalated to use of Soviet-built tanks, helicopters, and fighter bombers appropriated by both sides after the collapse of the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, in February 1947, Prime Minister Clement Attlee {{announced}} that the British government would grant full self-governance to British India by June 1948 at the latest. On 3 June 1947, the British government {{announced that}} the principle of division of British India into two independent states was accepted. The successor governments would be given dominion status and would have an implicit right <b>to</b> <b>secede</b> from the British Commonwealth. Viceroy Mountbatten chose 15 August, {{the second anniversary of}} Japan's surrender in the World War II, as the date of power transfer. He chose 14 August as the date of the ceremony of power transfer to Pakistan because he wanted to attend the ceremonies in both India and Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton's faction {{were against}} any {{conditional}} ratification, {{under the impression}} that New York would not be accepted into the Union, while Clinton's faction wanted to amend the Constitution, while maintaining the state's right <b>to</b> <b>secede</b> if their attempts failed. During the state convention, New Hampshire and Virginia becoming the ninth and tenth states to ratify the Constitution, respectively, had ensured any adjournment would not happen and a compromise would have to be reached. Hamilton's arguments used for the ratifications were largely iterations of work from The Federalist Papers, and Smith eventually went for ratification, though it was more out of necessity than Hamilton's rhetoric. The vote in the state constitution was ratified 30 to 27, on July 26, 1788.|$|E
5|$|Houphouët-Boigny {{was also}} a major {{contributor}} to the political tensions in Biafra. Considering Nigeria a potential danger to French-influenced African states, Foccart sent Houphouët-Boigny and Lieutenant-Colonel Raymond Bichelot on a mission in 1963 to monitor political developments in the country. The opportunity to weaken the former British colony presented itself in May 1967, when Biafra, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, undertook <b>to</b> <b>secede</b> from Nigeria. French-aligned African countries supported the secessionists who, provided with mercenaries and weapons by Jean Mauricheau-Beaupré, began a civil war. By the end of the 1960s, French-supported nations suddenly and openly distanced themselves from France and Côte d'Ivoire's position on the civil war. Isolated on the international scene, both countries decided to suspend their assistance to Ojukwu, who eventually went into exile in Côte d'Ivoire.|$|E

5|$|In early 1861 after Texas voted <b>to</b> <b>secede</b> {{from the}} United States {{and join the}} Confederacy, Ross's brother Peter began {{recruiting}} men for a new military company. Shortly after Ross enlisted in his brother's company as a private, Governor Edward Clark requested he instead proceed immediately to the Indian Territory to negotiate treaties with the Five Civilized Tribes so they would not help the Union Army. One week after his May 28 wedding to Lizzie Tinsley, Ross {{set out for the}} Indian Territory. Upon reaching the Washita Agency, he discovered the Confederate commissioners had already signed a preliminary treaty with the tribes.|$|E
5|$|The Act of February 18, 1895 {{amended the}} {{previous}} year's borough bill {{to raise the}} requirement for incorporation petitions from owners of 10 {{percent of the land}} value to 50 percent. The rush was also slowed by the legislature deciding that no borough created thereafter could maintain a separate school system unless there were at least 400 children living within its limits. With the Bergen County Board of Chosen Freeholders by then at 28 members, divided evenly between the parties, the legislature passed a bill setting the number of members of such boards in third-class counties (including Bergen) at 9, with the freeholders elected from the Delford-style boroughs to go out of office on May 8. Nevertheless, on May 9, electors in what became the borough of Englewood Cliffs voted <b>to</b> <b>secede</b> from Englewood, 34–1.|$|E
5|$|The American Civil War {{was a major}} {{conflict}} fought {{between the}} federal government of the United States and eleven of its member States which sought <b>to</b> <b>secede</b> and {{to create their own}} government, the Confederate States of America. It started on April 12, 1861, shortly after Abraham Lincoln was elected President of the United States, and ended four years later on April 9, 1865. During the war over 10,000 military engagements took place and more than 3 million people fought on both sides with 40% of the battles being fought in the states of Virginia and Tennessee.|$|E
