25|$|Side reins {{are usually}} used for more {{advanced}} horses. They give the horse something {{to take contact}} with, encourage balance and correct head carriage, help develop self-carriage, and keep the horse from putting its head too low. Side reins may be attached from the bit to the surcingle rings, or from the bit to <b>the</b> <b>billets</b> of the girth.|$|E
25|$|Direct {{extrusion}}, {{also known}} as forward extrusion, {{is the most common}} extrusion process. It works by placing <b>the</b> <b>billet</b> in a heavy walled container. <b>The</b> <b>billet</b> is pushed through the die by a ram or screw. There is a reusable dummy block between the ram and <b>the</b> <b>billet</b> to keep them separated. The major disadvantage of this process is that the force required to extrude <b>the</b> <b>billet</b> is greater than that needed in the indirect extrusion process because of the frictional forces introduced by the need for <b>the</b> <b>billet</b> to travel <b>the</b> entire length of the container. Because of this the greatest force required is at the beginning of process and slowly decreases as <b>the</b> <b>billet</b> is used up. At the end of <b>the</b> <b>billet</b> <b>the</b> force greatly increases because <b>the</b> <b>billet</b> is thin and the material must flow radially to exit the die. The end of <b>the</b> <b>billet</b> (called <b>the</b> butt end) is not used for this reason.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{one of the}} {{benefits}} of spray forming is purportedly the ability to produce bulk material with fine scale microsegregation and little or no macrosegregation work on Al-Mg-Li-Cu alloys showed that as a consequence of the interconnected liquid in <b>the</b> <b>billet</b> there was significant macrosegregation in large spray formed wrought Al <b>billets.</b> <b>The</b> distribution of Cu, Mg and Li in, for example, Al alloy 8091 showed surprisingly pronounced macrosegregation with the variation of Cu(wt%) in a spray formed 8091 billet, ranging from approximately 1.4 at <b>the</b> <b>billet</b> centre to 1.92 at <b>the</b> <b>billet</b> periphery. These macrosegregation patterns were explained in terms of inverse segregation in which solute rich liquid from <b>the</b> <b>billet</b> centre is sucked back through the primary Al-rich network to feed solidification shrinkage at <b>the</b> <b>billet</b> periphery. This effect was suggested to be exacerbated by centrifugal effects from <b>the</b> <b>billet</b> rotation.|$|R
40|$|The {{degree of}} nonuniformity of <b>the</b> <b>billet</b> {{temperature}} {{subjected to the}} radiative heat loss to the discharge door with different insulation thicknesses is investigated in this present study. The 2 -D steady-state heat conduction for <b>the</b> <b>billet</b> subjected to different heat fluxes is solved by being transformed into a dimensionless form.

A qualitative agreement between these two is observed. An effect of different insulation thicknesses on the heat-transfer characteristics {{and the degree of}} nonuniformity of <b>the</b> <b>billet</b> temperature is examined. In case of the replaced 50 -mm thick insulation of the discharge door, the radiative heat loss to the discharge door is reduced by 49 % with the replaced insulation, and the degree of nonuniformity of <b>the</b> <b>billet</b> temperature is decreased by 23 °C...|$|R
25|$|Polo saddles are English-style, close contact, {{similar to}} jumping saddles; {{although}} most polo saddles lack a flap under <b>the</b> <b>billets.</b> Some players {{will not use}} a saddle blanket. The saddle has a flat seat and no knee support; the rider adopting a forward-leaning seat and closed knees dissimilar to a classical dressage seat. A breastplate is added, usually attached to the front billet. A standing martingale must be used: so, a breastplate is a necessity for safety. The tie-down is usually supported by a neck strap. Many saddles also have an overgirth. The stirrup irons are heavier than most, and the stirrup leathers are wider and thicker, for added safety when the player stands in the stirrups. The legs of the pony are wrapped with polo wraps from below the knee to the fetlock to minimize pain. Jumping (open front) or gallop boots are sometimes used along with the polo wraps for added protection. Often, these wraps match the team colours. The pony's mane is most often roached (hogged), and its tail is docked or braided {{so that it will}} not snag the rider's mallet.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{induction}} billet heater {{the whole of}} the billet or slug is heated. Normally for short billets or slugs a hopper or bowl is used to automatically present <b>the</b> <b>billets</b> in line to pinch rollers, chain driven tractor units or in some cases pneumatic pushers. <b>The</b> <b>billets</b> are then driven through the coil one behind the other on water cooled rails or ceramic liners are used through the coil bore which reduce friction and prevent wear. [...] The length of the coil {{is a function of the}} required soak time, the cycle time per component and the length of the billet. In high volume large cross section work it is not unusual to have 4 or 5 coils in series to give [...] of coil or more.|$|E

2500|$|While Public Law 689 {{authorized}} {{the creation of}} the WR, it also prohibited its members from serving outside the continental United States. This impediment changed on 27September 1944, when Public Law 441 amended 689 to allow WR members to serve in the Territory of Hawaii. Some thought the enactment of Public Law 441 was anticlimactic. Director Streeter believed that sending WR members to Hawaii [...] "was not worth all the trouble and cost". Nevertheless, the Marine Corps did deploy women to Hawaii. Hawaiian duty was on a volunteer basis. Many members applied, but only the very best of them were accepted. The requirements were stringent, inasmuch as the members had to have been on active duty for at least six months; commit to an 18-month tour; have a clean record; be in excellent mental and physical health; agree not to request leave to visit the mainland, and verify they had no dependents whose care might necessitate a trip back to the states. In addition, members were expected to have a stable personality, sufficient skill to fill one of <b>the</b> <b>billets</b> for which women had been requested, and motivation to do a good job. San Diego, California, became the staging area, where a short yet intense physical conditioning course was given. The first contingent of women arrived in Hawaii on 28January 1945. At mid-year, there were about 1,000 women serving in Hawaii. By January 1946, they were all back in the states.|$|E

25|$|A heated {{cylindrical}} billet workpiece is fed {{between two}} convex-tapered rollers, which are rotating {{in the same}} direction. The rollers are usually 6° askew from parallel with <b>the</b> <b>billet's</b> axis. <b>The</b> rollers are {{on opposite sides of}} <b>the</b> <b>billet,</b> and <b>the</b> surface of their largest cross sections are separated by a distance slightly smaller than the outside diameter (OD) of <b>the</b> original <b>billet.</b> <b>The</b> load imparted by the rollers compresses the material and the 6° skew provides both rotation and translation to <b>the</b> <b>billet.</b> <b>The</b> friction between the rollers and <b>the</b> <b>billet</b> is intentionally high, and is sometimes increased by using knurled rollers. This friction establishes stresses varying radially through <b>the</b> <b>billet,</b> with <b>the</b> highest stresses at the OD and the central axis. The stress exceeds the yield strength of <b>the</b> <b>billet</b> and causes circumferential fissures to propagate at various radii near the OD, and a central longitudinal void to form at the axis. A tapered mandrel is set inside and a short distance {{from the start of the}} central void. This mandrel forces the material outward and compresses the material against the back side of the tapered rollers. This compressive loading fuses the circumferential fissures and sets the initial internal diameter and OD values. The formed tube is then cooled and can be cold worked to refine the diameters and to achieve the desired yield strengths.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{inductive}} heating of the feedstock material {{is a very}} important step in the processing of semi solid metals.

Also, at the end of <b>the</b> heating <b>the</b> <b>billet</b> should have an uniform temperature distribution in order to obtain good forming results. A flatness based control will be presented to calculate the induced power over time trajectory from a desired trajectory for the temperature in the middle of <b>the</b> <b>billet.</b> <b>The</b> temperature trajectory has to be chosen so that <b>the</b> <b>billet</b> has <b>the</b> desired temperature behaviour.
