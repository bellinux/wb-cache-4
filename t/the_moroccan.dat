5|$|The Bombardment of Salé was a naval {{attack against}} <b>the</b> <b>Moroccan</b> city of Salé {{that took place}} between 26 and 27 November 1851, in {{response}} to the looting of a French cargo ship by residents of the city. After seven hours of fighting, <b>the</b> <b>Moroccan</b> artillery suffered severe damage, and the French bombarded the city through the night, damaging the city's infrastructure and the Great Mosque of Salé.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Moroccan</b> Division Memorial is {{dedicated}} to the memory of the French and Foreign members of <b>the</b> <b>Moroccan</b> Division, killed during the Second Battle of Artois in May 1915. The monument was raised by veterans of the division and inaugurated on 14 June 1925, having been built without planning permission. Excluding the various commemorative plaques at the bottom front facade of the memorial, campaign battles are inscribed on the left- and right-hand side corner view of the memorial. The veterans of the division later funded the April 1987 installation of a marble plaque that identified <b>the</b> <b>Moroccan</b> Division as the only division where all subordinate units had been awarded the Legion of Honour.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Moroccan</b> {{soldiers}} in both Rabat and Salé prepared to repel the French attack, and armed themselves with artillery. On the French side, Sané {{had moved to}} the fort {{at the entrance to the}} Bou Regreg river; Henri IV was a short distance from <b>the</b> <b>Moroccan</b> batteries north of Salé. Gomer moved to a suitable position to attack, and both Narval and Caton would provide logistical support.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Conclusion== Alarmed by the Spanish {{victory at}} the battle of Tetuán, the British put {{pressure}} on both <b>the</b> <b>Moroccans</b> & Spanish to make peace which resulted in the Spanish demand of 20 million duros (100 million pesetas) or $4 million in 1861 US dollars. The British lent <b>the</b> <b>Moroccans</b> £500,000 to aid in the repayment. The Spanish continued to occupy Tetuán until <b>the</b> <b>Moroccans</b> paid their debt and deployed customs agents to Moroccan ports as they often collected Morocco customs revenue as payment.|$|R
50|$|After the Marquis left, <b>the</b> <b>Moroccans</b> {{immediately}} recaptured <b>the</b> city. Another siege {{and several}} more battles occurred from 1721 until {{the death of}} Muley Ismail in 1727. A war for the throne broke out among the sultan’s sons. On April 22, a reconnaissance expedition from Ceuta confirmed that <b>the</b> <b>Moroccans</b> had left.|$|R

5|$|In 1954, {{six months}} after the battle at Điện Biên Phủ ended, the Algerian War started, and by 1956, both <b>the</b> <b>Moroccan</b> and Tunisian protectorates had gained independence. A French board of inquiry, the Catroux Commission, later {{investigated}} the defeat.|$|E

5|$|Lentil soup is {{prepared}} in many ways, with additions such as cilantro or meat. Other soups include the harira of <b>the</b> <b>Moroccan</b> Jews, {{which is a}} spicy soup of lamb (or chicken), chickpeas, lentils and rice, and Yemenite bone marrow soup known as ftut, which is served on special occasions such as weddings, and is seasoned with the traditional hawaij spice mix.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Moroccans</b> {{said they}} also {{captured}} twelve Sahrawis from the Polisario Front.|$|R
50|$|On {{the same}} day, the Véloce was {{dispatched}} to Maréchal Bugeaud with <b>the</b> healthy <b>Moroccan</b> prisoners, {{as well as}} with the flags taken to <b>the</b> <b>Moroccans,</b> which were deposited with great ceremony at the Invalides on 2 September 1844.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Moroccans</b> {{said that}} <b>the</b> Algerians were heavily armed with field guns, mortars, {{anti-aircraft}} guns and missiles.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Moroccan</b> Division was {{initially}} raised as the Marching Division of Morocco. The division comprised units of varying origins {{and although the}} name would indicate otherwise, it did not in fact contain any units originating from Morocco. Moroccans {{were part of the}} Marching Regiment of the Foreign Legion which was formed from the merger of the 2nd Marching Regiment of the 1st Foreign Regiment with the 2nd Marching Regiment of the 2nd Foreign Regiment, both also part of <b>the</b> <b>Moroccan</b> Division Brigades. The division contained Tirailleurs and Zouaves, of principally Tunisian and Algerian origin, and most notably Legionnaires from the 2nd Marching Regiment of the 1st Foreign Regiment and the 7th Algerian Tirailleurs Regiment. The French Legionnaires came, as attested to by a plaque installed on the memorial, from 52 different countries and included amongst them American, Polish, Russian, Italian, Greek, German, Czech, Swedish and Swiss volunteers, such as writer Blaise Cendrars.|$|E
5|$|Body of Lies was Alexander Witt's first credit as a {{director}} of photography; he had collaborated with Ridley Scott on six feature films previously, beginning as a second unit camera operator on Black Rain (1989). He shot the film in the Super 35 format with spherical lenses, and explained that these lenses offer more flexibility for interior and night pictures than the anamorphic alternative. They used Kodak Vision2 500T 5218 instead of Technicolor's OZ process, which did not perform well in tests in <b>the</b> <b>Moroccan</b> desert.|$|E
5|$|From 2000 {{excavations}} {{carried out}} by University College London and <b>the</b> <b>Moroccan</b> Institut National des Sciences de l'Archéologie et du Patrimoine {{under the direction of}} Elizabeth Fentress, Gaetano Palumbo and Hassan Limane revealed what should probably be interpreted as the headquarters of Idris I just below the walls of the Roman town {{to the west of the}} ancient city centre. Excavations within the walls also revealed a section of the early medieval town. Today, many artefacts found at Volubilis can be seen on display in the Rabat Archaeological Museum.|$|E

50|$|The U.S. State Department {{estimates}} <b>the</b> {{number of}} <b>Moroccan</b> Christians more than 40,000. Pew-Templeton estimates <b>the</b> number of <b>Moroccan</b> Christians at 20,000. The number of <b>the</b> <b>Moroccans</b> who converted to Christianity (most of them secret worshippers) are estimated between 8,000-40,000. Some sources estimates about 150,000 Muslim converted to Christianity in Morocco.|$|R
50|$|Only around thirty of {{the five}} hundred who had marched out escaped back {{to the safety of}} Tangier. As {{happened}} in other attacks by <b>the</b> <b>Moroccans,</b> <b>the</b> corpses of the English killed were mutilated.|$|R
5|$|On {{the final}} day of the 2014–15 Premier League season, Chamakh scored the winner in a 1–0 home victory against Swansea City at Selhurst Park, the club's final home goal of the season. Coincidentally, <b>the</b> <b>Moroccan</b> had scored his first Palace home goal of that season, when he scored against his former club West Ham in August. The goal was only his second league goal of the season. On 13 June 2016, it was {{announced}} that Chamakh had again been released by Crystal Palace.|$|E
5|$|One stew {{that may}} be served with {{couscous}} is <b>the</b> <b>Moroccan</b> tagine, a hearty, somewhat dry dish of meat and vegetables, cooked slowly in a pot (called a tagine) with a tall conical lid. Dishes from the Maghreb region of North Africa are often coloured and flavoured with the hot spice mixtures harissa and ras el hanout (containing such spices as cumin, coriander, saffron, cinnamon, cloves, chillies, and paprika). Other characteristic flavourings of the region are preserved lemons and dried apricots and raisins.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Palace, {{also known}} as Dar el-Makhzen, is located next to the Badi Palace. The Almohads built the palace in the 12th century {{on the site of}} their kasba, and it was partly remodeled by the Saadians in the 16th century and the Alaouites in the 17th century. Historically {{it was one of the}} palaces owned by <b>the</b> <b>Moroccan</b> king, who {{employed}} some of the most talented craftsmen in the city for its construction. The palace is not open to the public, and is now privately owned by French businessman Dominique du Beldi. The rooms are large, with unusually high ceilings for Marrakesh, with zellij (elaborate geometric terracotta tile work covered with enamel) and cedar painted ceilings.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{highlighted}} is the mansa’s betrayal by Hammad Amina, {{the chief of the}} Fulbe at Masina. Previously, Amina had promised support in taking Jenné, but went over to <b>the</b> <b>Moroccans</b> with whom he already had a king-vassal type relationship. He advised <b>the</b> <b>Moroccans</b> on what to expect from the Mandinka-Bamana force and kept his own forces from joining the battle. The Fulbe are not mentioned as lending military aid to Jenné’s defenders, but their absence from the battlefield may have had a great effect on the final outcome. The pashalik of Timbuktu would also regret putting faith in Hammad Amina. The Fulbe would eventually thrown off their nominal vassalage to the pashalik and hand <b>the</b> <b>Moroccans</b> their first major defeat in the Sahel.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Moroccans</b> showed reporters Soviet-made {{missiles}} with Algerian army markings at {{the site}} {{a few days after}} the battle.|$|R
50|$|Ambushed, the Legionaries {{fought to}} {{maintain}} cohesion, driving off attacks with mortar and small arms fire. Notable fighting {{was seen by}} the 1st platoon, which stubbornly denied ground to <b>the</b> <b>Moroccans</b> until heavy losses forced it to withdraw. Bloody attacks continued until nightfall, and were fiercely resisted by the Spanish, who inflicted heavy casualties. By nightfall, <b>the</b> <b>Moroccans</b> were too scattered and depleted of men to continue their assault, and retreated into the darkness.|$|R
5|$|After the French {{conquest of}} Algeria, Abdelkader El Djezairi {{declared}} war against France, and requested assistance from Sultan Abd al-Rahman of Morocco. When the Sultan responded favorably, it triggered the Franco-Moroccan War. France sent warships to bombard Tangier on 6 August 1844, destroying {{large parts of}} the city and its defenses. The French then bombarded Essaouira, and occupied the Iles Purpuraires. After the French army defeated <b>the</b> <b>Moroccan</b> cavalry at the Battle of Isly on 14 August 1844, Sultan Abd al-Rahman asked for peace with France, leading to the signing of the Treaty of Tangier on 10 September 1844. Morocco's defeat caused a revolt in Rabat; in Salé, the city's nobility, known as the Sharif, {{sent a letter to the}} Sultan complaining about the lack of weapons and ammunition in the city.|$|E
5|$|Arafat's {{first visit}} to Jerusalem came when his father, unable to raise seven {{children}} alone, sent him and his brother Fathi to their mother's family in <b>the</b> <b>Moroccan</b> Quarter of the Old City. They lived there with their uncle Salim Abul Saud for four years. In 1937, their father recalled them {{to be taken care}} of by their older sister, Inam. Arafat had a deteriorating relationship with his father; when he died in 1952, Arafat did not attend the funeral, nor did he visit his father's grave upon his return to Gaza. Arafat's sister Inam stated in an interview with Arafat's biographer, British historian Alan Hart, that Arafat was heavily beaten by his father for going to the Jewish quarter in Cairo and attending religious services. When she asked Arafat why he would not stop going, he responded by saying that he wanted to study Jewish mentality.|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>Moroccan</b> {{facility}} was one node {{in a wider}} network, Bond and Swann return to London where they meet M, Bill Tanner, Q, and Moneypenny {{with the intention of}} arresting C and stopping Nine Eyes from being activated. Swann and Bond are abducted separately, {{while the rest of the}} group proceed with the plan. After Q succeeds in preventing the Nine Eyes from going online, a brief struggle between M and C ends with C falling to his death. Meanwhile, Bond is taken to the ruins of the old MI6 building, which is scheduled for demolition after Raoul Silva's bombing. Moving throughout a ruined labyrinth, he encounters a disfigured Blofeld, who tells him that he has a choice between escaping the building before explosives are detonated or die trying to save Swann. Bond finds Swann and the two escape by boat as the building collapses. Bond shoots down Blofeld's helicopter, which crashes onto Westminster Bridge. As Blofeld crawls away from the wreckage, Bond confronts him but leaves him to be arrested by M, before leaving the bridge with Swann.|$|E
50|$|During {{the time}} the Ottomans were {{occupied}} in <b>the</b> siege, <b>the</b> <b>Moroccans,</b> who were allied with the Spanish, occupied the city of Tlemcen.|$|R
50|$|Probably 75,000 Moroccan Regulares {{fought in}} the Nationalist ranks. Spanish Morocco was an {{independent}} protectorate at the time so <b>the</b> <b>Moroccans</b> were not Spanish citizens.|$|R
50|$|On February 10, the 4th, 9th, and 13th Spanish Legion battalions, {{organised}} into a motorised group, drove <b>the</b> <b>Moroccans</b> from Edchera and advanced to Tafurdat and Smara.|$|R
5|$|Boston born Kenza Tazi was {{the sole}} female athlete {{competing}} for Morocco at the 2014 Winter Olympics. She had skied {{from the age of}} three onwards, and said her hero was American skier Bode Miller. At the time of the start of the 2014 Games, she was also 17; she celebrated her 18th birthday while in Sochi. She chose to represent Morocco over the United States as <b>the</b> <b>Moroccan</b> Ski Association offered to fund her training. Tazi qualified for the Sochi Olympics after competing successfully at a number of qualification events, despite injury problems. Also accompanying the two athletes was a third skier, Sami Lamhamedi, the brother of Adam. However, Sami did not compete in events, and was only there as a potential substitute. These athletes were also accompanied by four officials.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of the {{combined}} size of the French Army of the Levant divisions that participated in the battle ranged from 9,000 to 12,000 troops. The troops were mostly made up of Senegalese and Algerian units, and consisted of ten infantry battalions {{and a number of}} cavalry and artillery units. Among the participating units were the 415th Infantry Regiment, the 2nd Algerian Riflemen Regiment, the Senegalese Division, the African Riflemen Regiment and <b>the</b> <b>Moroccan</b> Sipahi Battalion. A number of Maronite volunteers from Mount Lebanon reportedly joined the French forces as well. The Army of the Levant was equipped with plain and mountain artillery batteries and 155mm guns, and backed by tanks and fighter bombers. The commander of the French forces was General Mariano Goybet.|$|E
5|$|On 28 June, an {{explosion}} occurred {{on one of}} the ship's pinnaces killing seven crewmen and badly injuring the future Vizeadmiral Wilhelm Starke. Further training exercises lasted until 1 July, when the I Division began a voyage into the Atlantic Ocean. This operation had political motives; Germany had only been able to send a small contingent of vessels—the protected cruiser , the coastal defense ship , and the sailing frigate —to an international naval demonstration off <b>the</b> <b>Moroccan</b> coast at the same time. The main fleet could therefore provide moral support to the demonstration by steaming to Spanish waters. Rough weather again allowed Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm and her sister ships to demonstrate their excellent seakeeping. The fleet departed Vigo and stopped in Queenstown, Ireland. Wilhelm II, aboard his yacht Hohenzollern, attended the Cowes Regatta {{while the rest of the}} fleet stayed off the Isle of Wight.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Royal <b>Moroccan</b> Army (الجيش الملكي, Armée royale, Ejército Real, [...] "Royal Army") is {{the branch}} of <b>the</b> Royal <b>Moroccan</b> Armed Forces {{responsible}} for land-based military operations.|$|R
50|$|Following its closure in 1977, it was {{transformed}} into a military barracks serving <b>the</b> 5th <b>Moroccan</b> air military base of Sidi Slimane by <b>the</b> Royal <b>Moroccan</b> Air Force.|$|R
25|$|In 1591, Morocco {{invaded the}} Songhai Empire under Ahmad al-Mansur of the Saadi Dynasty {{in order to}} secure the goldfields of the Sahel. At the Battle of Tondibi, the Songhai army was defeated. <b>The</b> <b>Moroccans</b> {{captured}} Djenne, Gao, and Timbuktu, but they were unable to secure the whole region. Askiya Nuhu and the Songhay army regrouped at Dendi in the heart of Songhai territory where a spirited guerrilla resistance sapped the resources of <b>the</b> <b>Moroccans,</b> who were dependent upon constant resupply from Morocco. Songhai split into several states during the 17th century.|$|R
