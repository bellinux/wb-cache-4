60|$|They sat apart, and not together; each looking afar off at vague objects, {{and not in}} each other's eyes.

Heading into the 2002 Gator Bowl, however, spread bettors predicted a reversal of that trend as Virginia Tech was favored to win by two points on Dec. 10. This was reflective of an overall feeling of pessimism toward the Seminoles, who hadn't finished out of {{first place in the}} ACC since joining the league in 1992, and would not participate in the national championship game {{for the first time in}} four years. Because of this decline in stature, the fact that the game was a rematch of the 2000 national championship game received less coverage than it would have otherwise.|$|E
