Some of the 'solutions' have been disastrous to the environment, resulting in untreated waste being dumped in places where it can pollute waterways and groundwater.|$|E
5|$|The nilgai is {{categorised}} as of Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural resources (IUCN). While it {{is common}} in India, the nilgai occurs sparsely in Nepal and Pakistan. <b>The</b> <b>major</b> <b>reasons</b> behind its decimation in these two countries and extinction in Bangladesh are rampant hunting, deforestation and habitat degradation in the 20th century. As of 2008, the feral population in Texas was nearly 37,000. Wild populations also exist in the US states of Alabama, Florida and Mississippi and the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, where they have escaped from private exotic ranches. The population around the Texas-Mexico border {{is estimated to be}} around 30,000 (as of 2011).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>major</b> <b>reasons</b> for rising {{political}} tensions {{among the}} Finns were the autocratic {{rule of the}} Russian Czar and the undemocratic class system of the estates of the realm. The system originated in the Swedish Empire regime, preceding the Russian power, and divided the Finnish people into two groups, separated economically, socially and politically. Finland's population grew rapidly in the 19th century (from 860,000 in 1810 to 3,130,000 in 1917), and a class of industrial and agrarian workers and property-less peasants emerged. The Industrial Revolution was rapid in Finland, though it started later than {{in the rest of}} Western Europe. Industrialization was financed by the state, and some of the social problems associated with the industrial process were diminished via control of the administration. Among urban workers, socioeconomic problems steepened during periods of industrial depression. The position of rural workers had worsened {{since the end of the}} 19th century, as farming became more efficient and market-oriented and the gradually developing industry did not fully utilize the rapid population growth of the countryside.|$|E

25|$|Bureaucratic red-tapism {{was removed}} {{to a large}} extent under this operation, since it was one of <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>reasons</b> for low {{recording}} of bargadars.

25|$|In each {{of these}} areas, there is {{considerable}} debate as to the optimal treatment.

40|$|This paper {{contrasts}} {{the differing}} experience of public sector unionism, which has expanded in the United States, {{and private sector}} unionism, which has contracted, {{in the past several}} decades. It uses the experience of other countries, particularly Canada, to rule out some explanations of the divergent trends. The paper finds that <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>reason</b> for <b>the</b> private sector decline is increased management opposition to union organization, motivated in part by profit-seeking behavior, and augmented by trade union responses; and that <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>reason</b> for <b>the</b> public sector union expansion is decreased market opposition due to pas- sage of comprehensive collective bargaining laws and motivated in part by vote-seeking behavior. ...|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>major</b> <b>reasons</b> for declining {{populations in}} North America are control {{programs}} for prairie dogs {{and loss of}} habitat. Burrowing owls readily inhabit some anthropogenic landscapes, such as airport grasslands or golf courses, and are known {{to take advantage of}} artificial nest sites (plastic burrows with tubing for the entrance) and perches. Genetic analysis of the two North American subspecies indicates that inbreeding is not a problem within those populations.|$|E
25|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>reasons</b> is the stadium's design. Originally {{built in}} a shallow sinkhole, the playing surface is below ground level. Expansions have {{enclosed}} the playing area on all sides with steep stands, and the fans are within {{a few feet of}} the action. This traps crowd noise inside the stadium, which results in sound levels on the field which have been measured at 115 decibels—just short of the threshold of pain.|$|E
25|$|Closed-die forging {{has a high}} {{initial cost}} due to the {{creation}} of dies and required design work to make working die cavities. However, it has low recurring costs for each part, thus forgings become more economical with more volume. This is one of <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>reasons</b> closed-die forgings are often used in the automotive and tool industries. Another reason forgings are common in these industrial sectors is that forgings generally have about a 20 percent higher strength-to-weight ratio compared to cast or machined parts of the same material.|$|E

25|$|The Indian National Scientific Documentation Centre {{states that}} the Jafarabadi buffalo is a hybrid of the African cape buffalo and the Indian water buffalo, the former {{originally}} been brought to British India for slaughtering. The Centre notes this {{to be one of}} <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>reasons</b> for the buffalo's poor semen quality. The hybrid buffalos were widely present in Jafarabad, and were hence named as Jafarabadi buffalo. Jafarabadi buffaloes have heavy heads with fairly large, thick, flat horns, which drop {{on the sides of the}} neck and go on upwards till the ears.|$|E
25|$|Unlike in the Western {{cultural}} sphere, {{which has}} portrayed its foreign intelligence agencies (such as the CIA and MI6) in different media forms, Indian authors and actors have been shy {{to explore the}} area of espionage, especially R, until the 1990s. Unlike CBI, the federal investigative agency of India, whose existence is known {{to the majority of}} people, R receives little to no attention from the populace, which seems to be unaware of the existence of such an organisation or even India's internal intelligence agency, the Intelligence Bureau (IB). Excessive secrecy surrounding activities and rare declassification of the information are considered to be <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>reasons</b> behind this.|$|E
25|$|By 1976, these {{programs}} progressed to where a long-range strategic stealth bomber appeared viable. President Carter {{was aware of}} these developments during 1977, and {{it appears to have}} been one of <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>reasons</b> the B-1 was canceled. Further studies were ordered in early 1978, by which point the Have Blue platform had flown and proven the concepts. During the 1980 presidential election campaign in 1979, Ronald Reagan repeatedly stated that Carter was weak on defense, and used the B-1 as a prime example. In return, on 22 August 1980, the Carter administration publicly disclosed that the United States Department of Defense was working to develop stealth aircraft, including a bomber.|$|E
