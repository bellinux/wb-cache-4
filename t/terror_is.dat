25|$|War on Terror: Although R's {{contribution}} to the War on <b>Terror</b> <b>is</b> highly classified, the organisation gained some attention in the Western media after claims that it was assisting the United States by providing intelligence on Osama Bin Laden and the Taliban's whereabouts. Maps and photographs of terrorist training camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan along with other evidence implicating Osama bin Laden in terrorist attacks were given to US intelligence officials. RAW's role in the War on Terror may increase as US intelligence has indicated that it sees RAW as a more reliable ally than Pakistani intelligence. It has further come to light that a timely tip-off by RAW helped foil a third assassination plot against Pakistan's former President, General Pervez Musharraf.|$|E

25|$|The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, {{also known}} as Tower of <b>Terror,</b> <b>is</b> an {{accelerated}} drop tower dark ride located at Disney's Hollywood Studios, Tokyo DisneySea, Walt Disney Studios Park, and formerly located at Disney California Adventure Park. Except for the Tokyo DisneySea version, the attractions are inspired by Rod Serling's anthology television series, The Twilight Zone, and {{take place in the}} fictional Hollywood Tower Hotel in Hollywood, California. The Tokyo version, which features an original story line not related to The Twilight Zone, takes place in the fictional Hotel Hightower. All three versions place riders in a seemingly ordinary hotel elevator, and present the riders with a fictional backstory in which people have mysteriously disappeared from the elevator under the influence of some supernatural element many years prior.|$|E
25|$|To {{the upper}} right of the horse, a frightened female figure, {{who seems to be}} {{witnessing}} the scenes before her, appears to have floated into the room through a window. Her arm, also floating in, carries a flame-lit lamp. The lamp is positioned very close to the bulb, and is a symbol of hope, clashing with the lightbulb. From the right, an awe-struck woman staggers towards the center below the floating female figure. She looks up blankly into the blazing light bulb. Daggers that suggest screaming replace the tongues of the bull, grieving woman, and horse. A dove is scribed on the wall behind the bull. Part of its body comprises a crack in the wall through which bright light (hope, or the outside world) can be seen. On the far right, a woman with arms raised in <b>terror</b> <b>is</b> entrapped by fire from above and below; her right hand suggests the shape of an airplane. A dark wall with an open door defines the right end of the mural.|$|E

500|$|A {{wide range}} of {{emotions}} such as resentment and <b>terror</b> <b>is</b> expressed through exaggerated facial expressions. [...] Ward broadens his use of visual symbolism, as with a young woman's purity represented by a flower she wears—she is deflowered by a young man whose vest is adorned with flowers. [...] His house also displays a floral stucco pattern and is adorned with phallic spears and an exultant rooster as a weathervane.

[...] Connie Britton and Clancy Brown also star. Gallner and Mara explained that the teenagers in the remake are [...] "a little more aware" [...] of Freddy and their situation, whereas in the original Gallner and Mara characterized Nancy and her friends as [...] "more mellow" [...] and [...] "nonchalant" [...] about their situation until they were finally killed.|$|E

500|$|The Independents radio critic Robert Hanks was unimpressed with Kneale's {{script for}} the {{dramatic}} sections, but praised {{the performance of}} Andrew Keir in the title role. [...] "Lesser actors would treat Kneale's downbeat script with a certain detachment, but Keir is prepared to charge even the most banal lines with a terror that's both a treat and a lesson." [...] Hanks also felt that The Fifties season as a whole, as demonstrated by The Quatermass Memoirs, had a somewhat misleading focus. [...] "You {{get the sense that}} a vogue for science fiction is being interpreted as the spirit of the Fifties, with emphasis being put on a handful of sci-fi films. If you really wanted to read the age through its movies, you'd have to include Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, late Ealing and early Norman Wisdom, Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley. It's a lot to accommodate; perhaps sticking to <b>terror</b> <b>is</b> just less intimidating." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite all the {{transformations in}} the industry, by 1961 the average {{production}} {{cost of an}} American feature film was still only —after adjusting for inflation, less than 10 percent more {{than it had been}} in 1950. The traditional twin bill of B film preceding and balancing a subsequent-run A film had largely disappeared from American theaters. The AIP-style dual genre package was the new model. In July 1960, the latest Joseph E. Levine sword-and-sandals import, Hercules Unchained, opened at neighborhood theaters in New York. A suspense film, <b>Terror</b> <b>Is</b> a Man, ran as a [...] "co-feature" [...] with a now familiar sort of exploitation gimmick: [...] "The dénouement helpfully includes a 'warning bell' so the sensitive can 'close their eyes.'" [...] That year, Roger Corman took AIP down a new road: [...] "When they asked me to make two ten-day black-and-white horror films to play as a double feature, I convinced them instead to finance one horror film in color." [...] The resulting House of Usher typifies the continuing ambiguities of B picture classification. It was clearly an A film by the standards of both director and studio, with the longest shooting schedule and biggest budget Corman had ever enjoyed. But it is generally seen as a B movie: the schedule was still a mere fifteen days, the budget just $200,000 (one-tenth the industry average), and its 85-minute running time close to an old thumbnail definition of the B: [...] "Any movie that runs less than 80 minutes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Matheson, {{primarily}} {{known for}} horror fiction, {{wanted to move}} away from the genre. [...] "I was determined to fight against this image. Dammit, I never wrote 'real' horror to begin with! To me, horror connotes blood and guts, while <b>terror</b> <b>is</b> a much more subtle art, a matter of stirring up primal fears. But, by the mid-seventies, I had tired of playing the fright game. Scaring the hell out of people no longer appealed to me." [...] He based Chris's family in the novel on his own.|$|E
2500|$|Jeremiah's [...] "confessions" [...] are {{a type of}} {{individual}} lament. Such laments are found elsewhere in the psalms and the Book of Job. Like Job, Jeremiah curses {{the day of his}} birth (Jer. 20:14–18 and Job 3:3–10). Likewise, Jeremiah's exclamation [...] "For I hear the whispering of many: <b>Terror</b> <b>is</b> all around!" [...] (Jer. 20:10) matches Psalm 31:13 exactly. However, Jeremiah's laments are made unique by his insistence that he has been called by Yahweh to deliver his messages. These laments [...] "provide a unique look at the prophet's inner struggle with faith, persecution, and human suffering".|$|E
