But he warned that fans were in for a longer wait than expected, after lead singer Brian Johnson suggested there would be new material the next year. Malcolm stated, [...] "You know what Brian's like. He just says things and then walks away. It'll be a little while– {{a year or two}} anyway. I've been doing some jamming on some song ideas but I do <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> as do the rest of the band. We are still working. But we had a long rest between Stiff Upper Lip and Black Ice, so I think we need a couple of years to recuperate and work on it a bit more." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Greg Kot, 808s & Heartbreak {{initiated}} the [...] "wave of inward-looking sensitivity" [...] and [...] ""-inspired rappers {{during the late}} 2000s: [...] " [...] presaged everything from the introspective hip-hop of Kid Cudi's [...] (2009) to the wispy crooning, plush keyboards and light mechanical beats of Bon Iver's Justin Vernon and British dub-step balladeer James Blake." [...] Consequence of Sound credited it with shaping subsequent developments in [...] "indie R or electropop {{or whatever you want}} to call it": [...] "808s is flooded with R and it digitizes the raw emotion and isolated feelings that [...] have carved their brands out of today." [...] Craig D. Linsey from The Village Voice wrote that the album's [...] "naked humanity ... practically set off the emo-rap/r boom that everyone from Drake to Frank Ocean to The Weeknd now traffic in." [...] Marcus Scott of GIANT said rappers such as B.o.B, Drake, and Kid Cudi followed West's album with similarly-minded works, citing West's introspective, emotional themes and synthpop/"Vangelis-inspired" [...] music as influences. In the opinion of Billboard senior editor Alex Gale, the album was [...] "the equivalent of (Bob) Dylan going electric, and you still hear <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> in hip-hop and outside of hip-hop." [...] Drake's 2009 mixtape So Far Gone received comparisons from critics to 808s & Heartbreak. Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times cited 808s & Heartbreak as [...] "the template [...] for essentially the entirety of Drake's young career", and that wrote that he [...] "shares West's love for mood and never-ending existential analysis". In a 2009 interview, Drake cited West as [...] "the most influential person" [...] in shaping his own sound. In 2014, Rolling Stone named 808s & Heartbreak one of the 40 most groundbreaking albums of all time. On September 26, 2015, West performed the album in its entirety at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles.|$|E

2500|$|After {{losing to}} Kim Clijsters in an {{exhibition}} in Hong Kong, she lost {{in the first round}} of the Australian Open to Julia Schruff. But immediately following that tournament, Dementieva won her first Tier I event, the Toray Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo. On the run to the title, she defeated Katarina Srebotnik, Nicole Vaidišová, and Anastasia Myskina, all in three sets. She then defeated the resurgent Martina Hingis, with Hingis saying after the match, [...] "If she played like <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> she'd win Grand Slams". At the Pacific Life Open, despite double faulting 79 times in six matches, Dementieva reached the final. She defeated rising stars Sania Mirza, Ana Ivanovic, and Li Na along the way. Dementieva then upset Justine Henin in a semifinal 2–6, 7–5, 7–5. The victory was her fourth three set match of the tournament, and fatigue contributed to her 6–1, 6–2 loss to Maria Sharapova in the final.|$|E
2500|$|Although his terse one-liners {{are well}} known, {{he is also}} known for having a dark sense of humour. On the 20th lap of the 2012 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Räikkönen had just taken the lead from Lewis Hamilton and his race {{engineer}} Simon Rennie advised that Fernando Alonso was five seconds behind {{and that he would}} be kept informed of Alonso's pace; Räikkönen replied, [...] "Just leave me alone, I know what I'm doing!" [...] Later in the same race, he admonished his team again, when being told to manage the tyre temperature: [...] "Yes, yes, yes, yes, I'm doing <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> You don't have to remind me every ten seconds!" [...] The first quote attracted significant press coverage, and Räikkönen made no attempt to apologise in the post-race interview. It was earlier reported that he printed 500 T-shirts with the quote for the entire Lotus team, but this was later invalidated by Räikkönen in an interview with an FOM media personnel. The quote is also featured on his official website.|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of stochastic systems with non-exponential timing requires {{the development of}} suitable modeling tools. Recently, some eort {{has been devoted to}} generalize the concept of Stochastic Petri nets, by allowing <b>the</b> ring <b>times</b> to be generally distributed.

The paper surveys suitable restrictions of the PN model with generally distributed transition times, that have appeared in the literature, and compares these models {{from the point of view}} of the modeling power and the numerical complexity. Key words: Stochastic Petri Nets, Non-exponential Distributions, Phase-type Distributions, Markov and Semimarkov Reward Models, Markov Regenerative Processes, Queueing Systems with Preemption. 1 Introduction The usual denition of Stochastic Petri Net (SPN) implies <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>timed</b> activities associated to the transitions are represented by exponential random [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Typically, {{people begin}} the process of searching for a job by {{constructing}} a resume or a CV. Most of you probably have at least one or the other. Some of you may have even consulted a book or two about constructing resumes. However, most of you probably have received no formal advice, and are proceeding based on the examples of friends or family. The rules of CV construction are probably familiar to most of you, since you come from a work environment where that document is the norm. Most research scientists, however, do not have any experience writing a resume and wind up constructing a document that looks very much like, well…, a CV. Even though we live in a free society there are some rules to resume writing. Adhering to these rules makes you look informed, serious and professional. Most of these “rules” are also simple common sense. The main purpose of a resume is to get you an interview. It is very rare that someone is hired sight-unseen. The typical employer spends about 20 seconds on each resume. Stop now, put this booklet down and count to 20. <b>That’s</b> it. <b>That’s</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> your resume has to stand out and make an impression.
