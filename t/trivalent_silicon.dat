40|$|Fluorine was {{introduced}} by ion implantation into MOS structures with sputtered oxide. After annealing, its effects on the high-frequency C-V curve and Fowler-Nordheim tunnelling barrier height were studied. An increase of acceptor dopant concentration in the substrate was observed due to the fluorine implantation. The presence of fluorine increased the Fowler-Nordheim tunnelling barrier height for electron injection from both metal and silicon. The role of fluorine is explained by a physical model {{similar to that used}} by Ma [4], where fluorine is assumed to bond with <b>trivalent</b> <b>silicon</b> trap centres in the sputtered oxide...|$|E
40|$|The {{generation}} of interface defects during the injection of electrons in metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) structures with thin SiO 2 gate layers and SiO 2 /ZrO 2 gate stacks is investigated. A model is proposed {{to explain the}} kinetics of interface defect generation, based on the depassivation of <b>trivalent</b> <b>silicon</b> dangling bonds (Si- 3 =-SiH Si- 3 =-Si*) at the (1 0 0) Si/SiO 2 interface by the injected electrons. A gaussian spread for the activation energy E-d related to the dissociation of the Si-H bond is included in this model. Comparison with experimental results reveals that the mean value of the activation energy E-di decreases linearly with the electric field E-ox across the SiO 2 layer. This behaviour is attributed to the alignment of the Si-H dipole moment with respect to E-ox, which favours the dissociation of the Si-H bond. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|The {{effects of}} gate bias {{stressing}} on threshold voltage and mobility in power VDMOSFETs and underlying changes in gate oxide-trapped charge and interface trap densities are presented and analyzed {{in terms of}} the mechanisms responsible. In the case of positive bias stressing, electron tunneling from neutral oxide traps associated with <b>trivalent</b> <b>silicon</b> ≡Sio defects into the oxide conduction band is proposed as the main mechanism responsible for positive oxide-trapped charge buildup, while subsequent hole tunneling from the charged oxide traps ≡Sio+ to interface-trap precursors ≡Sis-H is shown to be the dominant mechanism responsible for the interface trap buildup. In the case of negative bias stressing, hole tunneling from the silicon valence band to oxygen vacancy defects ≡Sio / Sio≡ is shown to be responsible for positive oxide-trapped charge buildup, while subsequent electro-chemical reactions of interfacial precursors ≡Sis−Η with the charged oxide traps ≡Sio+ Sio≡ and H+ ions are proposed to be responsible for interface trap buildup...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} of employing periclase to stabilize chromium in chromium wastes into spinel-based ceramics through thermal method was investigated by heating mixture of simulated chromium waste and magnesium oxide. Different types of magnesium oxide precursors {{were introduced to}} incorporate chromium oxide into magnesiochromite (MgCr 2 O 4) ranging from 550 ºC to 1350 ºC. Magnesium oxide precursors of both types can effectively incorporate chromium oxide but via different mechanisms. Three main factors that can affect the leaching behavior of MgCr 2 O 4 were studied, which are 1) the influence of different precursors; 2) the influence of cooling rate of sintered samples; 3) the influence of annealing temperature of sintered samples. Results revealed that samples of larger particle size had better leaching performance. Fast cooling rate, as well as high annealing temperature, could prohibit the formation of chromium(VI) during thermal treatment process. The comparison of prolonged both acidic and alkaline leaching tests of chromium oxide and magnesiochromite demonstrated superior stabilization performance of MgCr 2 O 4 in stabilizing chromium. This study confirmed the feasibility of applying periclase to stabilize chromium and suggested optimistic conditions for processing chromium-containing wastes under thermal treatment methods. Hexavalent chromium waste (simulated with CaCrO 4) was successfully reduced to <b>trivalent</b> chromium with <b>silicon</b> carbide (SiC) under thermal conditions. A combination of SiC and MgO can reduce hexavalent chromium to trivalent chromium and stabilize trivalent chromium into MgCr 2 O 4 through a one-step thermal treatment. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|The {{generation}} of interface defects and positive charge during the injection of electrons in p-Si/SiO 2 /ZrO 2 /TiN structures is investigated. The kinetics of {{generation of}} both type of defects {{are found to}} be very similar. A model is proposed to explain the interface defect generation, based on the depassivation of <b>trivalent</b> <b>silicon</b> dangling bonds (Si- 3 =SiH [...] >Si- 3 =Si-.) at the (100) Si/SiO 2 interface by the injected electrons. A Gaussian spread for the activation energy E-d related to the dissociation of the Si-H bond is included in this model. Comparison with experimental results reveals that the mean value of the activation energy E-di decreases linearly with the electric field E-ox across the SiO 2 layer. This behavior is attributed to the alignment of the Si-H dipole moment with respect to E-ox, which favors dissociation of the Si-H bond. The hint of a correlation between the interface defect and positive charge generation suggests that the positively charged centers might be hydrogen-induced overcoordinated oxygen centers.

40|$|TThe {{effects of}} gate bias {{stressing}} on threshold voltage and mobility in power VDMOSFETs and underlying changes in gate oxide-trapped charge and interface trap densities are presented and analysed {{in terms of}} the mechanisms responsible. It is shown that gate bias stressing causes significant threshold voltage shift and mobility degradation in power VDMOSFETs; the negative bias stressing causes more rapid initial changes of both threshold voltage and mobility, but the final threshold voltage shift and mobility reduction are significantly larger in devices stressed by positive gate bias. In the case of positive bias stressing, electron tunnelling from neutral oxide traps associated with <b>trivalent</b> <b>silicon</b> =Siodefects into the oxide conduction band is proposed as the main mechanism responsible for positive oxide-trapped charge buildup, while subsequent hole tunnelling from the charged oxide traps =Si+o to interface-trap precursors =Sis-H is shown to be the dominant mechanism responsible for the interface trap buildup. In the case of negative bias stressing, hole tunnelling from the silicon valence band to oxygen vacancy defects =Si**oSio= is shown to be responsible for positive oxide-trapped charge buildup, while subsequent electro-chemical reactions of interfacial precursors =Sis-H with the charged oxide traps =Si+*oSio=and H+ ions are proposed to be responsible for interface trap buildup.
