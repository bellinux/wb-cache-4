5|$|<b>The</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Southern Pictish Zone at Dunnottar and Dundurn {{represented}} {{a major threat}} to Ecgfrith's suzerainty. Ecgfrith was contending with other challenges to his overlordship. In June 684, countering a Gaelic-Briton alliance, he sent his armies, led by Berhtred, son of Beornhæth, to Brega in Ireland. Ecgfrith's force decimated the local population and destroyed many churches, actions which are treated with scorn by Bede.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Take Ichi convoy blunted the 32nd and 35th Divisions' {{fighting}} power. The 32nd Division's combat {{elements were}} reduced from nine to five infantry battalions and {{from four to}} {{one and a half}} artillery battalions. Only four of the six 35th Division infantry battalions which sailed in the convoy reached Halmahera and much of the division's artillery was lost.|$|E
5|$|A last {{option was}} to attack fighter factories, {{which was not}} {{attempted}} on 18 August. Only the Spitfire factory at Southampton and the Hawker factory in Surrey were within range of escorted bombers. Without the Bf 109s, the bombers would suffer heavy casualties attempting to attack factories further north in daylight. Still, <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> southern factories would require large concentrations of bombers and fighters which would be powerful enough to destroy them without sustaining heavy losses.|$|E

50|$|After the Six-Day War, the {{activity}} in northern Israel where Golani was based was mostly limited to raids against fedayeen (guerrilla) bases in Jordan, Lebanon and the West Bank (now under Israeli control). The objectives of these raids was {{to undermine the}} fedayeen bases {{in order to prevent}} <b>attacks</b> against Israelis. <b>The</b> three main raids against Jordan during this period were: <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> village Wadi al-Yabis across the river from Tirat Tzvi; <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Cones Position across from Ashdot Ya'akov; and <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Jordanian Ghor canal and defensive line.|$|R

The eastern gate was attacked by Mahasona, Gothaimbara, Theraputthabhaya and Velusumana. The defenders of the eastern gates were routed by Velusumana after a cavalry attack, and Elara's forces withdrew into the city.|$|E
5|$|Giovanni Ribisi as Parker Selfridge, the {{corporate}} {{administrator for the}} RDA mining operation. While he is at first willing to destroy the Na'vi civilization to preserve the company's bottom line, he is reluctant to authorize <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Na'vi and taint his image, doing so only after Quaritch persuades him that it is necessary, and the attacks will be humane. When the attacks are broadcast to the base, Selfridge displays discomfort at the violence.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Kondo ordered Abe's Vanguard {{force to}} race ahead {{to try to}} {{intercept}} and engage the U.S. warships. Kondo also brought his own Advanced force forward at maximum speed so that Junyōs aircraft could join in <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> U.S. ships. At 08:10, Shōkaku launched a second wave of strike aircraft, consisting of 19 dive bombers and eight Zeros, and Zuikaku launched 16 torpedo bombers at 08:40. Thus, by 09:10 the Japanese had 110 aircraft {{on the way to}} attack the U.S. carriers.|$|E

5|$|Taxable, Glimmer and Big Drum were {{complicated}} in execution, requiring {{coordination of}} air and naval forces. Launched in poor weather conditions, Taxable {{did not appear to}} have the desired effect and failed to elicit any significant response from the Germans. The reaction to Glimmer was more encouraging. <b>The</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bomber squadrons indicated, at least to the satisfaction of RAF Bomber Command, that the Germans believed a genuine threat existed. There is no evidence that Big Drum elicited any specific response from the shore. According to historian Mary Barbier, the adverse conditions and complexity of the operations contributed to the limited enemy response.|$|E
5|$|While <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Mariana Islands did {{not seriously}} disrupt the USAAF air campaign, {{they had an}} effect on other American operations. After {{determining}} that the Japanese raiders were staging through Iwo Jima, American forces stepped up their attacks on that island. While the decision to invade Iwo Jima had been made before the raids commenced, stopping the attacks formed part of the justification for the landing. In addition, further air defense units were deployed to the Mariana Islands to protect the B-29 bases.|$|E
5|$|At his new forward {{command post}} at Ben Cat, General Dũng {{prepared}} {{plans for the}} final battle. He encircled Saigon with four North Vietnamese corps and the hastily assembled 232nd Tactical Force, a total of 19 divisions plus supporting artillery and armored units, approximately 130,000 men. His plan was to avoid intensive street fighting within the city itself by first tying down outlying South Vietnamese forces in their defensive positions and then launching five spearheads through them into the city, each of which had a specific target: the Independence Palace, the Joint General Staff headquarters, the national Police headquarters, Tan Son Nhut Air Base, and the Special Capital Zone headquarters. <b>The</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> periphery began on 26 April and the main attack on the city center began the following day.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} positioning, the 5th Parachute Brigade was largely {{protected}} by the 6th Airborne Division's other units, and did not suffer from the almost constant German attempts to dislodge the division. However, the 12th Parachute Battalion was attacked on 7June by seven tanks and an infantry company. The attack was beaten off {{for the loss of}} three tanks, but caused several casualties amongst 'A' Company, including the crew of their only supporting 6pounder anti-tank gun. Later the same day during an attack on the 13th Parachute Battalion, three German self-propelled guns were destroyed, and the next day the battalion destroyed another six attacking tanks. The 12th Battalion, Devonshire Regiment arrived by sea later in the day, and took over the 12th Parachute Battalion's position. The 7th and 12th Parachute Battalions and the 2nd Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry now formed the divisional reserve. Elements from three German formations were responsible for <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> division; the 21st Panzer Division and the 346th and 711th Infantry Divisions.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} the Allies' {{occupation}} of Japan, special-service officers of the Imperial Japanese Navy destroyed virtually all records, drawings, and photographs of or relating to the Yamato-class battleships, leaving only fragmentary records of the design characteristics and other technical matters. The destruction of these documents was so efficient that until 1948 the only known images of Yamato and Musashi were those taken by United States Navy aircraft involved in <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> two battleships. Although some additional photographs and information, from documents that were not destroyed, have come to light over the years, the loss of the majority of written records for the class has made extensive research into the Yamato class somewhat difficult. Because of the lack of written records, information on the class largely came from interviews of Japanese officers following Japan's surrender.|$|E
5|$|Repairs to Vittorio Veneto were {{completed}} {{in time for}} her to join Littorio on attacks on the convoys Vigorous and Harpoon, which had departed Alexandria and Gibraltar to reinforce Malta simultaneously in mid-June. Combat was limited to the opposing light forces, and Littorio and Vittorio Veneto did not see action; the British nevertheless broke off Operation Vigorous due to the ships' presence and heavy air attacks. While returning to port, Littorio was hit by a bomb from an American B-24 Liberator heavy bomber; the bomb struck the forward gun turret, though it did minimal damage. Before returning to port, a British Wellington bomber torpedoed the ship. The torpedo struck her starboard bow, though she returned to port. Repairs {{were completed}} and on 12 December, both ships were moved from Taranto to La Spezia in response to the Allied landings in North Africa. Roma joined the fleet shortly after <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> two convoys, and joined her sisters for the move to La Spezia. There, she replaced Littorio as the fleet flagship.|$|E

5|$|The NATO council {{declared}} <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> United States were {{an attack}} on all NATO nations which satisfied Article 5 of the NATO charter. This marked the first invocation of Article 5, which had been written during the Cold War with an attack by the Soviet Union in mind. Australian Prime Minister John Howard who was in Washington D.C. during the attacks invoked Article IV of the ANZUS treaty. The Bush administration announced a War on Terror, with the stated goals of bringing bin Laden and al-Qaeda to justice and preventing the emergence of other terrorist networks. These goals would be accomplished by imposing economic and military sanctions against states harboring terrorists, and increasing global surveillance and intelligence sharing.|$|E
5|$|While the Ottoman Fourth Army {{continued}} to hold {{the eastern side of}} the Jordan Valley, Es Salt, Amman and the Hejaz railway, Chaytor's smaller force was to continue the EEF's occupation of the Jordan Valley. As soon as possible, Chaytor's Force was to advance northwards to capture the Jisr ed Damieh bridge, which would cut a main line of retreat for the Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies. This was also a main line of communication between the two armies west of the Jordan River in the Judean Hills with the Fourth Army in the east. The expectation was that, <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Eighth Army by the XXI and Desert Mounted Corps, and the start of the Battle of Nablus attacks on the Seventh Army, would force the Fourth Army to withdraw northwards along the Hejaz railway to conform with the withdrawals of the Seventh and Eighth Armies.|$|E
5|$|With the Chinese infiltrating the Canadian {{perimeter}} {{through the}} gaps between platoons, D Company was close to being surrounded. The company commander—Captain J.G.W. Mills—was subsequently forced to call down artillery fire onto his own position on several occasions during the early morning of 25 April to avoid being overrun. The tactic succeeded and the exposed Chinese were soon swept off the position, while the dug-in Canadians escaped unharmed. The Chinese persisted however, launching a number of smaller attacks {{during the rest of}} the night, but these were again repulsed by artillery and small arms fire. By dawn <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Canadian positions had abated, and with D Company remaining in control of the summit they were able to recover the previously abandoned machine-gun at first light. Meanwhile, on the right flank B Company was also able to re-occupy the platoon position it had been forced to relinquish earlier the previous evening. The Chinese had suffered heavily during the night, with perhaps as many as 300 killed by the Patricias.|$|E

5|$|XXBomber Command's {{attacks on}} Singapore {{produced}} mixed results. The raids on Singapore Naval Base {{damaged or destroyed}} many workshops and denied the Japanese {{the use of the}} King GeorgeVI Graving Dock between late 1944 and early 1945, and the AdmiraltyIX Dry Dock from February 1945. In addition, workers at the Naval Base did not return to work for some time after each raid, and had to be provided with better pay and rations and additional air-raid shelters. Although the damage inflicted on the Empire Docks area impeded Japanese port operations, the poor condition of the port area also hindered British efforts to rehabilitate Singapore following the war. <b>The</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> oil storage tanks on islands near Singapore were less successful, and many were found to still be operable after the Japanese surrender.|$|E
5|$|Aware {{that the}} Parliamentarians under Fairfax {{were on their}} way, Hopton {{increased}} <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> town on 6 May. Further attacks the following day focused {{on the east side}} of the town, first bombarding it with cannon shot, and then storming the earthen redoubt that Blake had established. After some early success in which they captured one of the earthen forts, the attackers were forced back by a combination of musket shot, stones and boiling water. The next day, after yet more attacks made little impact, Hopton staged a battle on the south side of the town between two parties of his own army in an attempt to make Blake believe the Parliamentarian army had arrived. Hopton hoped that Blake would send out some of his own men to support the relieving force, but the feint failed. That evening, at around 7 pm, the Royalist force, which consisted of around 4,200 infantry and 2,000 cavalry, launched an all-out assault against the town. In heavy fighting, the attackers captured two of the earthen forts on the eastern side of town, and broke through the defences. Once inside Blake's outer perimeter, the besieging army discovered that there were Parliamentarian musketeers within every house, which prevented them advancing any further, though they did set fire to buildings, hoping to force the defenders to retreat. The tactic failed when the wind blew the flames back towards the Royalists, halting their attack.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the attackers}} {{seem to have}} wanted to force the Jews to convert, {{although}} they were also interested in acquiring money from them. Physical violence against Jews was never part of the church hierarchy's official policy for crusading, and the Christian bishops, especially the Archbishop of Cologne, {{did their best to}} protect the Jews. A decade before, the Bishop of Speyer had taken the step of providing the Jews of that city with a walled ghetto to protect them from Christian violence and given their chief Rabbis the control of judicial matters in the quarter. Nevertheless, some also took money in return for their protection. The attacks may have originated in the belief that Jews and Muslims were equally enemies of Christ, and enemies were to be fought or converted to Christianity. Godfrey of Bouillon was rumoured to have extorted money from the Jews of Cologne and Mainz, and many of the Crusaders wondered why they should travel thousands of miles to fight non-believers when there were already non-believers closer to home. <b>The</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Jews were witnessed by Ekkehard of Aura and Albert of Aix; among the Jewish communities, the main contemporary witnesses were the Mainz Anonymous, Eliezer ben Nathan, and Solomon bar Simson.|$|E
