25|$|All tobacco {{advertising}} and sponsorship on television has been banned within the European Union since 1991 under the <b>Television</b> <b>Without</b> <b>Frontiers</b> Directive (1989). This ban was extended by the Tobacco Advertising Directive, which took effect in July 2005 to cover {{other forms of}} media such as the internet, print media, radio, and sports events like F1. The directive does not include advertising in cinemas and on billboards or using merchandising – or tobacco sponsorship of cultural and sporting events which are purely local, with participants coming from only one Member State as these fall outside {{the jurisdiction of the}} European Commission. However, most member states have transposed the directive with national laws that are wider in scope than the directive and cover local advertising. A 2008 European Commission report concluded that the directive had been successfully transposed into national law in all EU member states, and that these laws were well implemented.|$|E

5000|$|In 2002, the European Parliament {{tried to}} revitalize the efforts on {{regulating}} media concentration at the European level and adopted a resolution on media concentration which called on the European Commission to launch a broad and comprehensive consultation on media pluralism and media concentration and to prepare a Green Paper on the issue {{by the end of}} 2003. The European Commission failed to meet this deadline. In the following years, during the process of amending the <b>Televisions</b> <b>Without</b> <b>Frontiers</b> directive, which was adopted by the EP and the Council in 2007, the issue of media concentration was discussed, but it did not represented the core of the debate. In 2003, the European Commission issued a policy document named [...] "The future of European Regulatory Audiovisual Policy" [...] which stressed that, in order to ensure media pluralism, measures should aim at limiting the level of media concentration by establishing [...] "maximum holdings in media companies and preventing cumulative control or participation in several media companies at the same time".|$|R
40|$|The study {{explored}} {{the question of}} who am I? as a (re) construction of cultural identity by delving into globalisation, communication, and social change in Malta during a historical moment when Malta became a European Union Member State. Three objectives guided this qualitative study. Firstly the study reviewed European Union (EU) policies that regulate broadcasting and their implementation in Member States, whilst meeting the challenges of globalisation and new media technology. This was conducted partly through documentation analysis and partly through interviews. Secondly the research investigated the changes of the media landscape in terms of organisational structures, programmes and television (TV) content partly through interviews and partly through content analysis. Finally the study {{explored the}} impact of these transformations taking place in the way Maltese live as they (re) construct their cultural identity. This third objective was addressed through focus groups. The analysis shows that the setting up of quotas by EU, set to promote and protect the cultural identity whitin its Member States and moved from <b>Television</b> <b>Without</b> <b>Frontier</b> directive towards an Audiovisual Media Services directive to address the latest digital technology and media convergence. Trasformation of Malta media landscape resulted in: changes in policies hence pluralism and transnational broadcasting reaching the island and its people; restructuring of local TV stations to cater and meet the new challenges; th...|$|R

50|$|The Audiovisual Media Services Directive 2007 (2007/65/EU) of the European Union was {{implemented}} into UK law through Part 4A of the Communications Act 2003. The Directive updated the <b>Television</b> <b>Without</b> <b>Frontiers</b> Directive 1989 (89/552/EEC) {{to cover the}} extension of traditional television regulation to TV-like VOD. This directive {{was implemented}} in the UK on 19 December 2009 with regulations amending the Communications Act 2003.

50|$|Due to the {{introduction}} of the <b>Television</b> <b>Without</b> <b>Frontiers</b> Directive (1989), tobacco advertising and sponsorship on television have been banned within the European Union since 1991. Formula One is facing a major threat regarding this point. Due to these political and legislative circumstances, Grand Prix in this circuit was left out of the 2003 calendar {{as a response to the}} internal tobacco legislation in Belgium. The event was tagged as a World Class event within the national senate, and thus it was saved for the 2004 Formula One season.

40|$|A {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} manner in which France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK have implemented the provisions in 1989 <b>Television</b> <b>Without</b> <b>Frontiers</b> Directive for television advertising and sponsorship shows that there are obstacles {{for the development of a}} Single European Market in television advertising. Although 1989 <b>Television</b> <b>Without</b> <b>Frontiers</b> Directive allowed transfrontier television advertising, the regulation of television advertising remains nationally based. Furthen-nore, Member States have different levels of advertising expenditure, selling practices and television market structures. There is a tension between the provisions for television advertising and sponsorship in the Council of Europe Convention on Transfrontier Television and those in the <b>Television</b> <b>Without</b> <b>Frontiers</b> Directive. Member States have indicated their commitment to one text over the other in the detailed choices for their national rules. The European Court of Justice resolved some of the contradictions and ambiguities in the 1989 <b>Television</b> <b>Without</b> <b>Frontiers</b> Directive, and these have been reflected in the revised 1997 text. But there is still an ambiguity so as to what level of sponsor presence is adequate to ensure both transparency, and the protection of a broadcaster's editorial independence. Rules about the frequency and quantity of advertising differ between the five countries and four of them set different competitive requirements according to the type of broadcaster. There are marked differences in the rules about advertising breaks in feature films and other audiovisual works. National rules on sponsorship also vary, especially those on centre credits and the promotional mentions of the sponsor within the programme. So do the detailed provisions. National regulators decide when and what type of commercial presence constitutes surreptitious advertising. In some countries, it is only payment that renders product placement illegal, whereas in others the product has to be editorially justified and not given undue prominence. Direct offers to the public have proved to be a grey area in Member States where their economic value was high. Teleshopping is likely to become a significant source of programming, especially if Member States effectively expand their limits on airtime as allowed in the 1997 text. Although some differences have been resolved in the 1997 revision of the <b>Television</b> <b>Without</b> <b>Frontiers</b> Directive, there are still difficulties in establishing an effective level playing field for European television advertising...|$|E

40|$|Observers of {{the media}} {{policies}} of the European Union contend that the transmission state principle of the <b>Television</b> <b>Without</b> <b>Frontiers</b> Directive, by ruling out the restriction of trans-frontier broadcasts, which are {{in compliance with the}} laws of the originating state, has signified the end of the broadcasting sovereignty of the Member States. The transmission state principle is central to the objective of the <b>Television</b> <b>Without</b> <b>Frontiers</b> Directive to create an internal market in broadcasting services. Laid down initially in Article 2 (2) of Directive 89 / 552 EEC, it has been transferred to Article 2 a(1) following the adoption of the revised Directive 97 / 36 EC. The meaning of the principle has remained the same: Member States are obliged to ensure the unhindered reception of broadcasts lawfully transmitted in their state of origin...|$|E
40|$|For Hollywood film studios, strict Chinese {{regulations}} {{controlling the}} importation {{and distribution of}} foreign audiovisual works within China have made the Chinese audiovisual market as impenetrable as the Great Wall. Recently, in China—Measures Affecting Trading Rights, the World Trade Organization (WTO) ordered China to relax its barriers to foreign films. China has yet {{to comply with the}} order, causing ongoing protest by the United States. Meanwhile, the United States has long tolerated <b>Television</b> <b>Without</b> <b>Frontiers,</b> a European Union (EU) Directive that imposes local content quotas that restrict the amount of non-European programming aired on television. This Note compares the Chinese regulations with the EU Directive, and the corresponding American responses. It theorizes that the U. S. position against <b>Television</b> <b>Without</b> <b>Frontiers</b> has been strengthened by China—Measures Affecting Trading Rights, and that the United States should take a uniformly aggressive stance against foreign barriers to audiovisual trade to protect Hollywood’s interests abroad...|$|E
40|$|With the {{liberalisation}} of European Broadcasting {{from the}} 1980 s {{and the early}} identification by new commercial channels of sporting events as key content to encourage viewing/subscription the relationship between sports and media organisations has inevitably become closer and more lucrative. However with the amendment of the <b>Television</b> <b>Without</b> <b>Frontiers</b> directive in 1997 a new element - the state - entered the equation, rendering {{it all the more}} complex. This paper demonstrates the extent to which in the modern era sports journalism can only offer a truly comprehensive account of events by adopting approaches more commonly associated with business and political journalism. It does so by examining the biggest Irish âsportsâ story of 2002 : not the Irish teams participation in the World Cup but the subsequent sale of broadcast rights for that teamâs home games to BSkyB. The narrative throws light on the increasingly complex relationship between sport, commercial and public service media, and the state but also details an extremely novel application of the <b>Television</b> <b>Without</b> <b>Frontiers</b> directive by the Irish state...|$|E
