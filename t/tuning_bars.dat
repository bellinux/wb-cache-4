40|$|In this thesis, two {{separate}} research topics are undertaken {{both in the}} general area of compact RF/microwave circuit design. The first topic involves characterizing the parasitic effects and error due to unused post-production <b>tuning</b> <b>bars.</b> Such <b>tuning</b> <b>bars</b> are used in microwave circuit designs to allow the impedance or length of a microstrip line to be adjusted after fabrication. In general, the <b>tuning</b> <b>bars</b> are simply patterns of small, isolated sections of conductor adjacent to the thru line. Changing the impedance or length of the thru line involves bonding the appropriate <b>tuning</b> <b>bars</b> to the line. Unneeded <b>tuning</b> <b>bars</b> are simply not removed and left isolated. Ideally, {{there should be no}} coupling between these unused <b>tuning</b> <b>bars</b> and the thru line. Therefore, the unused <b>tuning</b> <b>bars</b> should have a negligible effect on the circuit??s overall performance. To nullify the parasitic effects of the <b>tuning</b> <b>bars,</b> conventional wisdom suggests placing the bars 1. 0 to 1. 5 substrate heights away from the main line. While successful in the past, this practice may not result in the most efficient and cost-effective placement of <b>tuning</b> <b>bars</b> in today??s compact microwave circuits. This thesis facilitates the design of compact tuning bar configurations with minimum parasitic effects by analyzing the error attributable to various common tuning bar configurations with a range of parameters and offset distances. The error is primarily determined through electromagnetic simulations, and the accuracy of these simulations is verified by experimental results. The second topic in this thesis involves the design of compact microwave resonators using the transmission line approach to create negative refractive index metamaterials. A survey of the major developments and fundamental concepts related to negative refractive index technology (with focus on the transmission line approach) is given. Following is the design and measurement of the compact resonators. The resonators are also compared to their conventional counterparts to demonstrate both compactness and harmonic suppression...|$|E

The accelerating structures will oper-ate at 425 ~MHz and {{will consist of}} a radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ) to 2 [...] -MeV and a drift-tube linac (DTL) from 2 to 50 -MeV. Design parameters have been speci-fied to match the maximum operating capabilities of the rf system: 2 -ms pulse length and 6 % duty factor. The accelerating gradient in the OTL will be 4 -MV/m; the maximum electric field will be approximately 1. 2 times the Kilpatrick limit. These design parameters are substantially more ambitious {{than those of the}} accelerator test stand (ATS). The larger accelerating gradient and increased duty factor will increase the average power density in the DTL to approximately 25 times the design values for the ATS DTL. The increased duty factor will raise the average power density on the proposed RFQ to ap-proximately 6 times the operating values of the ATS RFQ. The instantaneous power density on the drift tubes is predicted to be 60 W/sq cm, and the average power density is predicted to be 4 W/sq cm. These power densities are not excessive, but do represent design challenges in specific areas. Some components where thermal difficulties may be encountered include RFQ vanes, drift tubes, post couplers, slug tuners, t-f seals, and <b>tuning</b> <b>bars.</b> That copper will be used on the rf-structure sur-faces is not in question.

50|$|A gangsa {{is a type}} of metallophone {{which is}} used mainly in Balinese and Javanese Gamelan music. In Balinese gong kebyar styles, {{there are two types of}} gangsa {{typically}} used: the smaller, higher pitched kantilan and the larger pemade. Each instrument consists of several <b>tuned</b> metal <b>bars</b> (either iron or bronze) each placed over an individual resonator. The bars are hit with a wooden panggul, each producing a different pitch. Duration of sound intensity and sound quality factors are generally accomplished by damping the vibration of the bar with the fingers of the free hand. Balinese gong kebyar gangsas, as with other metallophones in gong kebyar ensembles, are played in neighboring pairs with interlocking, rapid-tempo parts that elaborate on the melody of a piece of music (see Kotekan); these pairs are tuned to be dissonant and create certain wavelengths of sympathetic vibrations to create a shimmering tone (see Ombak) that travels long distances. The gangsa is very similar to the old gendér and the saron.|$|R

The 20 most prominent modal frequencies and mode shapes were extracted from this analysis. A 3 -D finite element (FE) analysis of this bar, based on an orthotropic model for the material, has been conducted in parallel. Modal analysis and finite element modeling yield very similar mode shapes and modal frequencies for the first 12 modes, between 130 Hz and 4000 Hz, which confirms the experimental results and validates the theoretical approach.

30|$|One can mimic {{detuning}} effects {{by adding}} external noise to stimuli, {{although this is}} an imperfect approximation. External noise added to an oriented bar, for instance, will theoretically reduce firing of a neuron <b>tuned</b> to that <b>bar’s</b> orientation, while increasing the probability that neurons tuned to other orientations will respond. While adding external noise is unlikely to mimic the perceptual experience of an older participant, {{it allows us to}} behaviorally explore the effects of increased internal noise. Along these lines, some conceptually similar work, on the question of how decreased contrast impacts reading performance, has been performed with groups of older and younger participants to better understand how they differ (Mitzner & Rogers, 2003). In the case of our study, adding external noise will effectively broaden neuronal tuning relative to the undegraded stimulus, increasing noise in participants’ responses.|$|R

In conversation with the composer, his friend and colleague Robert Craft remarked “Your music always has an element of repetition, of ostinato. What is the function of ostinato?” Stravinsky replied; “It is static - that is, anti-development; and sometimes we need a contradiction to development.” Stravinsky was particularly skilled at using ostinatos to confound rather than confirm rhythmic expectations. In the first of his Three Pieces for String Quartet, Stravinsky sets up three repeated patterns, which overlap one another and never coincide.

25|$|Part of {{what makes}} the flapamba’s {{characteristic}} sound is the tuning; for instance, the resonators are not <b>tuned</b> to the <b>bars</b> as in other standard keyboard percussion instruments. Renowned studio percussionist Emil Richards bought his original flapamba from Professional Drum Shop in Hollywood in the late 1960s or early 1970s, and added it to his giant instrument collection, the Emil Richards Collection. The staff at the store convinced him to buy it, as they told him that they were {{getting out of the}} percussion rental business since Emil was dominating much of the work in town. Emil couldn't find any info on the history or maker of the flapamba when he purchased it, but nevertheless he started using it on recording sessions, as the chromatic layout of the instrument made it an easy transition from other keyboard mallet instruments. He used the softest mallets possible or the meat of the fingers to get a warm, resonant, wooden sound. This original flapamba had a range from middle C (C4), up two full octaves.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a time-domain modeling {{for the sound}} pressure radiated by a xylophone and, more generally, by mallet percussion instruments such as the marimba and vibraphone, using finite difference methods. The time-domain model used for the one-dimensional (1 -D) flexural vibrations of a nonuniform bar has been described in a previous paper by Chaigne and Doutaut [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 101, 539 – 557 (1997) ] and is now extended to the modeling of the sound-pressure field radiated by the bar coupled with a 1 -D tubular resonator. The bar {{is viewed as a}} linear array of equivalent oscillating spheres. A fraction of the bar field excites the tubular resonator which, in turn, radiates sound with a certain delay. In the present model, the open end of the resonator is represented by an equivalent pulsating sphere. The total sound field is obtained by summing the respective contributions of the bar and tube. Particular care is given for defining a valid approximation of the radiation impedance, both in continuous and discrete time domain, on the basis of Kreiss’s theory. The model is successful in reproducing the main features of real instruments: sharp attack, <b>tuning</b> of the <b>bar,</b> directivity, tone color, and aftersound due to the bar-resonator coupling...|$|R
