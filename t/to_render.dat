5|$|Most {{academic}} sources {{maintain that}} the associations made between world events and Nostradamus's quatrains are largely the result of misinterpretations or mistranslations (sometimes deliberate) or else are so vague as <b>to</b> <b>render</b> them useless as evidence of any genuine predictive power.|$|E

50|$|If a pixel-by-pixel (image order) {{approach}} <b>to</b> <b>rendering</b> is impractical or {{too slow}} for some task, then a primitive-by-primitive (object order) approach <b>to</b> <b>rendering</b> may prove useful. Here, one loops through {{each of the}} primitives, determines which pixels in the image it affects, and modifies those pixels accordingly. This is called rasterization, and is the rendering method used by all current graphics cards.|$|R

5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} in 1997 by Revolution. Though serious in tone, The Smoking Mirror incorporates some humour and graphics animated {{in the style}} of classic animated films. It was the fourth and last game built with the Virtual Theatre engine, which was used <b>to</b> <b>render</b> the locations of the game's events.|$|E

5|$|A {{political}} party {{known as the}} South Indian Libertarian Federation (commonly referred to as Justice Party) was founded in 1916, principally to oppose {{the economic and political}} power of the Brahmin groups. The party's goal was <b>to</b> <b>render</b> social justice to the non-Brahmin groups. To gain the support of the masses, non-Brahmin politicians began propagating an ideology of equality among non-Brahmin castes. Brahmanical priesthood and Sanskritic social class-value hierarchy were blamed for the existence of inequalities among non-Brahmin caste groups.|$|E
5|$|Acid2 was {{released}} on 13 April 2005. On 31 October 2005, Safari 2.0.2 became the first browser to pass Acid2. Opera, Konqueror, Firefox, and others followed. With the release of Internet Explorer 8 on 19 March 2009, the latest versions of all major desktop web browsers now pass the test until IE10 {{was released}}, which fails the test. Its successor, Microsoft Edge, is able <b>to</b> <b>render</b> correctly it as of Windows 10 version 1607. Acid2 was followed by Acid3.|$|E

5|$|Although not {{required}} by law or military regulation, members of the uniformed services are encouraged <b>to</b> <b>render</b> salutes to recipients of the Medal of Honor {{as a matter of}} respect and courtesy regardless of rank or status, {{whether or not they are}} in uniform.

5|$|As {{they had}} in the battles of Badr and Uhud, the Muslim army again used {{strategic}} methods against their opponents (at Badr, the Muslims surrounded the wells, but did not deprive their opponents of water since Ali did not want to follow the footsteps of the Meccan army; at the Battle of Uhud, Muslims made strategic use of the hills). In this battle they dug a trench <b>to</b> <b>render</b> the enemy cavalry ineffective.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} 2008, {{simultaneous}} to Dominion of the Dark Djinn. The game's animated sequences were produced by Studio Ghibli, while the original score was co-composed by Joe Hisaishi. The art style was also inspired by Studio Ghibli's other productions. The character development of Oliver {{was a large}} focus of the game, intending to make children empathize with the character and for adults to relive their adolescence. The developers used {{the power of the}} PlayStation 3 to its full potential <b>to</b> <b>render</b> the world with great detail not possible in Dominion of the Dark Djinn.|$|E

In addition <b>to</b> <b>rendering</b> depth and contour information with the Phantom, we capture optic flow and present this to the user using sound cues. We propose that with further development, this system {{could be used as}} an assistive device that would allow visually impaired individuals to explore the "visual" world...|$|R
50|$|Drawing {{graphical}} {{control elements}} (widgets) without a scenegraph leads <b>to</b> <b>rendering</b> things that don't {{show up on}} the screen, things that {{do not need to be}} rendered; hence it leads to avoidable performance and battery life losses.|$|R
5|$|Docter began {{developing}} {{the film in}} 1996, and wrote the story with Jill Culton, Jeff Pidgeon, and Ralph Eggleston. Fellow Pixar director Andrew Stanton wrote the screenplay with screenwriter Daniel Gerson. The characters went through many incarnations over the film's five-year production process. The technical team and animators found new ways <b>to</b> <b>render</b> fur and cloth realistically for the film. Randy Newman, who composed the music for Pixar's three prior films, returned to compose its fourth.|$|E
5|$|Fifty animators {{worked on}} the scene in which the castle is built, and one frame {{required}} 30 hours <b>to</b> <b>render.</b> They later extended similar techniques to Elsa's clothing. While the traditional Norwegian rosemaling was the inspiration for her costuming early in the film, her ice gown was designed similarly to her palace, with snowflakes heavily influencing the style. Her cape itself is a large snowflake.|$|E
5|$|GioGio's Bizarre Adventure was {{developed}} by Capcom. It is based on Vento Aureo, the fifth part of Hirohiko Araki's manga series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, and features artwork by Araki. To recreate the art style of the manga, Capcom developed a technique called Artistoon, which is used <b>to</b> <b>render</b> cel-shaded graphics. Capcom published the game in Japan on July 25, 2002 for the PlayStation 2, with a budget-priced re-release following on September 20, 2007.|$|E

5000|$|Angela Grossmann (born 1955) is a Canadian artist, {{known for}} her oil {{paintings}} and mixed media collages. [...] Her works range from simplistic drawings <b>to</b> <b>rendering</b> {{of the human body}} by layering torn and manipulated photos of body parts.|$|R
5|$|In India, suicide used to {{be illegal}} and {{surviving}} family could face legal difficulties. The Indian government repealed this law in 2014. In Germany, active euthanasia is illegal and anyone present during suicide may be prosecuted for failure <b>to</b> <b>render</b> aid in an emergency. Switzerland has recently taken steps to legalize assisted suicide for the chronically mentally ill. The high court in Lausanne, Switzerland, in a 2006 ruling, granted an anonymous individual with longstanding psychiatric difficulties the right to end his own life.|$|E
5|$|Most of the non-player {{characters}} (NPCs) that {{inhabit the}} open world were motion captured. The developers contacted casting agencies, and asked {{their friends and}} families if {{they would like to}} appear as extras in the game. Over 75 people were scanned in a three-day period. They were seated in chairs and told not to move or smile, and a high-definition digital camera captured a 3D model of their faces. The camera sent out strobe light patterns to capture the volume and shape of each face. A 360-degree setup captured the actors' moving bodies, but mannequins were also used to help capture different clothing styles. Data collected from the cameras was used by the designers <b>to</b> <b>render</b> digital models, each composed of roughly 1.4 million polygons—any blank spots on the models would be digitally filled in by the designers. <b>To</b> <b>render</b> the models in the game, the data would be compressed by reducing the polygon count.|$|E
5|$|Officials in Texas, Florida, Alabama, Wyoming, Arizona, Oklahoma and Missouri opposed those {{elements}} of ACA over {{which they had}} discretion. For example, Missouri declined to expand Medicaid or establish a health insurance marketplace engaging in active non-cooperation, enacting a statute forbidding any state or local official <b>to</b> <b>render</b> any aid not specifically required by federal law. Other Republican politicians discouraged efforts to advertise {{the benefits of the}} law. Some conservative political groups launched ad campaigns to discourage enrollment.|$|E
