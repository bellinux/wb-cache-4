5|$|Tahna orders Kira {{at gunpoint}} {{to return to}} the station, {{intending}} to collapse the wormhole with an explosive device, because then Bajor will have no motivation to invite Federation presence on Bajoran territory, which he sees as a new occupation. Kira lurches the runabout to one side, causing Tahna to fall over and allowing her to pilot the ship through the wormhole to the Gamma Quadrant; where she ejects the bomb causing it to explode harmlessly in space. However, Tahna has regained control of his weapon and orders Kira {{to return to the}} Alpha Quadrant. There, Sisko gives Tahna an ultimatum, either to give himself over to the station's authorities, or to wait to be destroyed by the Cardassians. Tahna hands over his weapon to Kira, and turns himself in; Kira explains that he may come to understand why this was <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> someday.|$|E
5|$|Felton (Daniel Baldwin) visits Harry Prentice (Wilford Brimley), {{the elderly}} and bed-ridden father of his friend Chuckie (Michael Chaban). Ill and miserable, the hard-bitten Harry has decided he wants to die and has hired a suicide doctor. Felton {{believes}} this is wrong and convinces Chuckie to call it off, much to Harry's anger. A few days later, however, Harry wears Chuckie down and convinces his son to shoot him {{to death with a}} handgun. When Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) investigate, Chuckie claims Harry shot himself, which Lewis does not believe. Felton talks to Chuckie at the police station and Chuckie admits to the assisted suicide, but Felton tells him to stick to the original suicide story. Lewis realizes what happened and confronts Felton, who admits what Chuckie did and suggests it was <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> but Lewis adamantly disagrees. Since the bullet evidence is inconclusive, Felton asks Lewis to let Chuckie secretly wash his hands so no gunpowder residue will be found in tests. Lewis initially refuses, but he eventually reluctantly agrees, allowing Chuckie to get away with the shooting.|$|E

5|$|Yang expresses {{difficulty}} {{connecting with}} the children on pediatrics, to Robbins' disappointment. Tom becomes frightened when he notices Lexie is not wearing a name tag, so she attacks her and runs away. His mother is subsequently diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm, for which requires surgery, and Tom falls down the stairs, for which also requires surgery. Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) returns to the hospital, and informs Robbins that Yang is just sucking up. The Crawley's are uneasy about agreeing to surgery, but Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) convinces them that it is <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> An obstetrics and gynecology resident accidentally cuts off a baby's arm during a caesarian section, but it is healed by plastic surgeon Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), Robbins, and Yang.

25|$|An example: Suppose {{there is}} a library {{function}} whose purpose is to parse a single syslog file entry. What should this function do if the entry is malformed? There is no one right answer, because the same library could be deployed in programs for many different purposes. In an interactive log-file browser, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> might be to return the entry unparsed, so the user can see it—but in an automated log-summarizing program, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> might be to supply null values for the unreadable fields, but abort with an error, if too many entries have been malformed.|$|E

On several occasions Straw reiterated his position that the decision to invade was in his opinion <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> but said he did not 'know' for certain that this was the case. He said he understood why public opinion on several matters might differ from his own—a Newsnight/ICM poll showed over 70% of respondents believed the war in Iraq to have increased the likelihood of terrorist attacks in Britain, but Straw said he could not agree based on the information presented to him.|$|E
25|$|The school's mascot is an Indian. In 2004, {{there was}} a major {{controversy}} at the school about the appropriateness of the mascot. The school took up the issue after researching high schools and colleges around the U.S. with similar nicknames that had decided to change their mascots. Many of these schools had received complaints from Native American groups about the stereotypes that the mascots reinforced. The student council also discussed rumors that New Jersey would be banning Native American-related mascots, and eventually it was decided that taking up the issue by choice rather than force was <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> After months of public debate and an official symposium in which students voiced opinions {{from both sides of the}} issue, a vote was held among the students and faculty and the motion to keep the Indian was affirmed, 67% voting in favor of keeping the mascot.|$|E

500|$|Sorkin {{fought with}} the ABC network during the first season {{over the use of}} a laugh track and a live studio audience. The laugh track was widely decried by critics as jarring, with Joyce Millman of Salon.com {{describing}} it as [...] "the most unconvincing laugh track you've ever heard". Sorkin commented that: [...] "Once you do shoot in front of a live audience, you {{have no choice but to}} use the laugh track. Oftentimes [...] is <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Sometimes you do need a cymbal crash. Other times, it alienates me." [...] The laugh track was gradually dialed down and was gone by the end of the first season. Sorkin was triumphant in the second season when ABC agreed to his demands, unburdening the crew of the difficulties of staging a scene for a live audience and leaving the cast with more time to rehearse.|$|E
500|$|Although Noel rejoined Oasis a {{few weeks}} later, the band's {{management}} and handlers were worried. With an album's worth of songs already demoed, the general feeling among the Gallaghers was that they should record as soon as possible. Their manager, Marcus Russell, said in 2007 that [...] "in retrospect, we went in the studio too quickly. The smart move {{would have been to}} take {{the rest of the year}} off. But at the time it seemed like <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> If you're a band and you've got a dozen songs you think are great, why not go and do it." [...] Morris expressed opposite sentiments, arguing that [...] "It was a mistake on everyone's part, management very much included, that we didn’t record Be Here Now in the summer of 1996. It would have been a much different album: happy probably." [...] He described the Mustique demos as [...] "the last good recordings I did with Noel" [...] and had a good rapport with Gallagher before Knebworth, regarding the concert as having changed things for the worse.|$|E
