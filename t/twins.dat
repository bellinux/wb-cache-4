Cylindrical samples were compressed uniaxially from room temperature to 250 o C, with the compression axis parallel to the transverse direction (TD) of a hot-rolled Mg- 3 Al- 1 Zn sheet. <b>Twinning</b> was investigated by use of orientation maps constructed from electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) data.
