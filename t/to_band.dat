5|$|Lesbian {{consciousness}} {{began in}} Nicaragua in 1986, when the Sandinista National Liberation Front expelled {{gay men and}} lesbians from its midst. State persecution prevented the formation of associations until AIDS became a concern, when educational efforts forced sexual minorities <b>to</b> <b>band</b> together. The first lesbian organization was Nosotras, founded in 1989. An effort to promote visibility from 1991 to 1992 provoked the government to declare homosexuality illegal in 1994, effectively ending the movement, until 2004, when Grupo Safo– Grupo de Mujeres Lesbianas de Nicaragua was created, four years before homosexuality became legal again.|$|E
5|$|Overdrive is the 19th studio album by pop punk trio Shonen Knife. It was {{released}} on April 14, 2014 in Europe, and on April 16, 2014 in Japan. According <b>to</b> <b>band</b> leader Naoko Yamano, because their album Free Time (2010) was heavily influenced by punk rock, and Pop Tune (2012) had explored a more pop-oriented sound, Overdrive was {{a chance for the}} band to explore a more hard rock sound. The album's lyrics cover a wide array of topics, from green tea, fortune cookies, and cats.|$|E
5|$|The Daelaam are {{the unified}} protoss {{protectorate}} organization representing all known protoss kindred, races, castes, and factions. Before the Brood Wars, Protoss society was divided—the Khalai of the Protoss Empire, the exiled Nerazim, the heretic Tal'Darim, and the hibernating Purifiers. Because of the Great War and subsequent Brood War, the former body collapsed and all branches of protoss were forced <b>to</b> <b>band</b> together in sharing knowledge, integrating technology, and for mutual survival.|$|E

5|$|Homer goes to {{the arcade}} and enlists {{the help of a}} local video gamer, while Marge takes Lisa <b>to</b> <b>band</b> practice. She tells Lisa to smile no matter how she feels inside, to {{suppress}} her emotions in order to be popular, and that happiness will follow. But when she sees Lisa hiding her true feelings and being taken advantage of by her classmates, Marge changes her tune and tells Lisa to be herself and her support helps Lisa to feel genuinely happy. When Homer returns home, he is about to defeat Bart in a rematch but Marge unplugs the game console to announce Lisa's recovery, while Bart declares his retirement as undefeated video boxing champ. Later, the Simpsons visit a jazz club to hear Bleeding Gums Murphy sing a blues number written by Lisa.|$|E

One such group fled to the Upper Dry Creek Area. The {{archeology}} surveyors of the Lake Sonoma region believe that European encroachment was the reason why Pomo villages became more centralized; the people retreated to the remote valley <b>to</b> <b>band</b> together for defense and mutual support.|$|E
25|$|The post-Vietnam years saw the Corps numbers {{decline and}} {{reorganization}} to a two-battalion sized regiment. In 1973, Virginia Tech {{was among the}} first Corps of Cadets in the nation to enroll women, assigning them to L Squadron. In 1975, the first female cadet was assigned <b>to</b> <b>Band</b> Company. In 1979, L Squadron was disbanded and female cadets were integrated into the line companies. In 1991, the Cadet dormitories became coed.|$|E

40|$|Straightforward {{discretization}} of {{the equations}} of motion of a quasi-continuum interacting with an electromagnetic field often leads to physical and numerical difficulties.

25|$|The fraternity's by-laws {{formerly}} prescribed a puggaree <b>to</b> <b>band</b> a boater {{hat that}} is black silk {{with the middle}} third occupied by alternating stripes of gold, blue, and gold. The hat band was initially only sold through the head office, however, in 1922 Delta Upsilon began licensing {{a small number of}} hatter shops, primarily in Manhattan and New England, to produce and sell the puggaree for $1 if the customer first displayed their badge to the clerk as a mark of identification.|$|E
25|$|Computational {{chemical}} {{methods can}} be applied to solid state physics problems. The electronic structure of a crystal is in general described by a band structure, which defines the energies of electron orbitals for each point in the Brillouin zone. Ab initio and semi-empirical calculations yield orbital energies; therefore, they {{can be applied}} <b>to</b> <b>band</b> structure calculations. Since it is time-consuming to calculate the energy for a molecule, it is even more time-consuming to calculate them for the entire list of points in the Brillouin zone.|$|E
25|$|Because of the secretive {{nature of}} magic, {{research}} {{can sometimes be}} a challenge. Many magic resources are privately held and most libraries only have small populist collections of magicana. However, organizations exist <b>to</b> <b>band</b> together independent collectors, writers, and researchers of magic history, including the Magic Collectors' Association, which publishes a quarterly magazine and hosts an annual convention; and the Conjuring Arts Research Center, which publishes a monthly newsletter and biannual magazine, and offers its members use of a searchable database of rare books and periodicals.|$|E

40|$|We have {{determined}} the regional locations on mouse chromosome 14 {{of the genes}} for mouse adenosine kinase (ADK), nucleoside phosphorylase- 1 (NP- 1), and esterase- 10 (ES- 10) by analysis of rearranged mouse chromosomes in γ-irradiated Chinese hamster × mouse hybrid cell lines. Irradiated clones were screened for expression of the murine forms of these enzymes; segregant clones that expressed {{only one or two}} of the three markers were karyotyped. The patterns of enzyme expression in these segregants were correlated with the presence of rearranged chromosomes.

25|$|The Migrants’ Association for Social Cooperation and Culture (GÖÇ-DER) {{was founded}} in Istanbul in 1997. Branches were later {{established}} in Diyarbakir, Van and Hakkari. GÖÇ-DER has been sued five times for its activities. Four of them ended in acquittal. One case demanding the closure of GÖÇ-DER Diyarbakir is still pending after the Court of Cassation cancelled the decision of Diyarbakir Judicial Court No. 1 not <b>to</b> <b>band</b> the association.

25|$|Much of Puebla’s {{art scene}} had {{disappeared}} before the 20th century {{but in the}} 1920s, {{a group of young}} artists from the Escuela de Bellas Artes de Puebla (School of Fine Arts of Puebla) began <b>to</b> <b>band</b> together for mutual support. These artists eventually caught the attention and patronage of artists such as Diego Rivera and Dr. Atl and received visitors such as David Alfaro Siquieros, Frida Kahlo, Francisco Cornejo and Alfredo Guati Rojo. This effort would become the Barrio del Artista.|$|E
25|$|Many {{very large}} birds, such as ratites, {{flamingos}} {{and the largest}} swans, are extremely difficult <b>to</b> <b>band</b> because the cost of making a band which is capable of securely fitting their strong, heavy legs is prohibitive. At the other extreme, the smaller species of river and tree kingfishers, todies and certain lories, have such narrow tarsii that no band can be securely placed around it without imposing danger to blood circulation. With some gamebirds, such as the Indian Peafowl, spurs on the legs interfere with the bands, which thus can cause injury to the birds.|$|E
