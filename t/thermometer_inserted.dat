40|$|Objective – The {{objective}} was to determine a technique for obtaining accurate rectal temperature measurements using commonly available digital thermometers. Design – The design tested the accuracy of rectal temperature measurements using commonly available digital thermometers intended for use in humans {{as well as the}} effect of insertion technique. Animals and Procedures – Students measured rectal temperature on sixteen crossbred cows on 53 separate occasions. Students' initial measurements were made with techniques acquired from their own previous experience. The students then repeated the temperature measurements after being instructed to <b>insert</b> the digital <b>thermometer</b> up to the display window. Rectal temperatures were also measured with a Cornell-style mercury <b>thermometer</b> completely <b>inserted</b> intra-rectally and allowed to incubate for two minutes. Accuracy of both types of thermometers, was determined by comparison with temperature measurements of a water bath using two calibrated traceable thermometers. The affect of three intra-rectal angles of insertion was also determined. Results - Rectal temperatures based on student initial temperature measurements, Cornell mercury thermometer, and digital <b>thermometers</b> <b>inserted</b> to the window were 38. 46 +/- 0. 07 oC, 38. 95 +/- 0. 05 oC, 38. 77 +/- 0. 06 oC, respectively. Temperature readings were affected by 0. 1 oC by angle of insertion. In a water bath, student-owned and traceable (reference) thermometers recorded temperatures that were not significantly different. Cornell mercury thermometers measured water bath temperatures that were 0. 2 oC higher than that of calibrated thermometers. One of ten student digital thermometers was inaccurate. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance – Accurate temperature measurements can be obtained using digital thermometers if the <b>thermometer</b> is <b>inserted</b> to the display window. Angle of insertion of the digital thermometer is clinically unimportant and the thermometer's accuracy should be checked periodically...|$|R
5000|$|A sensor's {{sensitivity}} indicates {{how much}} the sensor's output changes when the input quantity being measured changes. For instance, if the mercury in a thermometer moves 1 cm when the temperature changes by 1 °C, the sensitivity is 1 cm/°C (it is basically the slope Dy/Dx assuming a linear characteristic). Some sensors can also affect what they measure; for instance, a room temperature <b>thermometer</b> <b>inserted</b> into a hot cup of liquid cools the liquid while the liquid heats the thermometer. Sensors are usually designed to have a small effect on what is measured; making the sensor smaller often improves this and may introduce other advantages.. [...] Technological progress allows more and more sensors to be manufactured on a microscopic scale as microsensors using MEMS technology. In most cases, a microsensor reaches a significantly higher speed and sensitivity compared with macroscopic approaches.|$|E

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} {{with the aim of}} determining the effect of Ascorbic Acid (AA) on diurnal fluctuations in Rectal Temperature (RT) of Bovan Nera pullets during the harmattan season. Thirty experimental pullets were administered AA orally at the dose of 60 mg kg - 1, while 20 control birds were given only clean water. Measurements of RT were taken for three days from 07 : 00 to 18 : 00 hours during the season using a standard clinical <b>thermometer,</b> <b>inserted</b> through the cloaca into the rectum of each pullet. The overall mean RT of experimental and control pullets were 41. 3 ± 0. 09 °C and 41. 3 ± 0. 06 °C, respectively. The recorded RT in the experimental pullets was lowest at 07 : 00 hours with the value of 41. 2 ± 0. 04 °C and highest at 15 : 00 hours with the value of 41. 5 ± 0. 04 °C (p< 0. 001). In the control pullets, the lowest RT was also recorded at 07 : 00 hours with the value of 41. 0 ± 0. 09 °C, while the highest value of 41. 5 ± 0. 07 °C (p< 0. 05) was recorded at 15 : 00 hours. The RT in both experimental and control pullets rose significantly (p< 0. 05) and concurrently with the hour of the day (r = 0. 668 and 0. 457, respectively). The dry-bulb temperature was positively correlated with the RT of both experimental and control pullets (r = 0. 991 and 0. 948, respectively). The fluctuation in RT of the experimental pullets was 1. 1 ± 0. 05 °C, while that of the control was 1. 3 ± 0. 08 °C (p< 0. 001). The RT values of both the experimental and control pullets showed distinct diurnal fluctuations. It is concluded that AA administration to pullets ameliorated the thermally stressful effect of the harmattan season and may enhance their productivity and health during the season...|$|E

A drill hole with diameter 4  mm was made in the centre point of the specimen where an optic-fibre <b>thermometer</b> was <b>inserted</b> to measure temperature during drying. Microwave drying was operated by irradiating discontinuously to set the centre point temperature of the specimen in the range of temperature between 95 and 100  °C. This range of temperature was designed to provide favourable condition and to prevent burning, judging from previous experiment. During irradiation, atmosphere of the camber was kept natural without any additional heating, and only fan was operated to exhaust evaporated moisture from the specimen. In terms of microwave heating up to 100  °C, the specimen was irradiated until the centre point of the specimen reached a temperature of 100  °C and afterwards moved to steam injection drying. Time to reach temperature 100  °C in this experiment varied in the range of 9 – 12  min.

40|$|This paper reports {{experiments}} that tested {{the capacity of}} steadily swimming juvenile shortfin mako sharks (Isurus oxyrinchus) to control rates of heat gain and heat loss. Juvenile makos inhabit the coastal waters off southern California during {{the spring and summer}} of each year and occur sufficiently close to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography to enable their capture and transport to the laboratory. Juvenile makos are most commonly found in the upper mixed water layer (18 – 22 °C), and telemetry studies have shown that makos undergo frequent dives below the thermocline, subjecting them to changes of up to 10 °C in ambient water temperature (Ta) (Holts and Bedford, 1993). The mako is a member of the shark family Lamnidae, a group convergent with the tunas (Thunnus spp.) in specializations for enhanced swimming performance (Bernal et al., 2001). Lamnids are similar to tunas in utilizing a counter-current heat-exchanging retia mirabilia to retain metabolic heat within certain regions of the body, including the aerobic, locomotor red muscle (RM), the eyes and brain and the viscera, thus elevating the temperature of these tissues and adjacent areas above Ta (Bernal et al., 2001; Carey et al., 1985; Carey and Teal, 1969).

40|$|Motor racing {{athletes in}} the closed-cockpit {{category}} are always facing life-threatening situations caused by heat stroke, especially in hot weather. We report here {{the development of a}} novel infrared-radiation-type eardrum thermometer, with a built-in earphone, which can be used for continuous measurement in GT car racing. We examined the accuracy of the system for core body temperature monitoring in 10 healthy volunteers (21. 8 ± 1. 0 (S. D.) yrs) using a temperature controlled water bath. In addition, we assessed the usefulness of the system under real racing conditions with 2 professional drivers in the practice session of 2010 SUPER GT International Series Round 4 MALAYSIA being held at the Sepang International Circuit. To examine accuracy two thermistor probes, one inserted into the ear canal and the other beneath the tongue, were used for measurements of eardrum and sublingual temperatures respectively. An infrared eardrum <b>thermometer</b> was <b>inserted</b> into the contra-lateral ear canal. The measured temperatures were recorded at 30 -s intervals. The results showed good correlation between the infrared eardrum temperature and both the direct eardrumtem temperature (r = 0. 994, n = 1119, p < 0. 001) and the sublingual temperature (r = 0. 972, n = 1119, p < 0. 001). The mean difference between these temperatures was + 0. 09 °C, - 0. 08 °C, and 1. 96 S. D. was 0. 21 °C, 0. 44 °C, respectively. As for the field test, the system functioned satisfactorily during real racing conditions performed on the racing circuit.

Patients were randomized preoperatively to the standard ablation group or the plasma ablation group. A <b>thermometer</b> was <b>inserted</b> into the inferior suprapatellar pouch, and the temperature, time, and duration of radiofrequency ablation were measured continually. ResultsNo {{significant differences were found}} between the standard ablation system and the plasma ablation system for maximum temperature (29. 77 °C and 29. 34 °C, respectively; P =. 95), mean temperature (26. 16 °C and 26. 99 °C, respectively; P =. 44), minimum temperature (22. 66 °C and 23. 94 °C, respectively; P =. 54), and baseline temperature (26. 80 °C and 27. 93 °C, respectively; P =. 35). Similarly, no significant differences were found for operative time (82. 90  minutes and 80. 50  minutes, respectively; P =. 72) and mean diathermy activation times (2. 6  minutes for both systems; P =. 90).

40|$|The {{balance between}} energy demand and the {{conservation}} of natural resources is a worldwide issue {{that people have been}} confronted with for over a thousand years {{and will continue to be}} an issue for future generations. Consequently the environment has been more or less destroyed by human activities with the boom of industrialization and modernization especially for non-renewable natural resources. Environmental problems such as increasing global population, water resource shortage, greenhouse gas emission and oil spills have persisted due to the unlimited human demands on obviously limited natural resources. [...] Contamination due to discharges from various manufacturing outfits and environmental degradation due to exploration and other associated highly economic human activities have resulted in consistent pollution problems requiring urgent attention. Many oil clean-up treatments have been developed and proved to be effective both in the laboratory and real situations, but the factorial analysis of diesel removal application under different weather and water environments might be a new research field. This study is based on the ide of using peat as an environmentally friendly material with easy application to clean up diesel-contaminated water from freshwater bodies especially lakes and rivers with low water turbulence. [...] An experimental water environment was simulated using varied impact factors such as water temperature, water turbulence and added diesel volume. A 200 mL beaker was placed in a 2 L cuboid tank which was filled with ice cubes to realize the simulation (for those combinations with 4 °C). A 75 mL sample of lake water and diesel was added to the beaker to simulate the water body, the 2 L cuboid tank was filled with ice cubes and a <b>thermometer</b> was <b>inserted</b> to adjust the environmental temperature under selected combinations.

40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{investigate}} and correct the temperature dependence of postmortem MR quantification used for soft tissue characterization and differentiation in thoraco-abdominal organs. MATERIAL AND METHODS Thirty-five postmortem short axis cardiac 3 -T MR examinations were quantified using a quantification sequence. Liver, spleen, left ventricular myocardium, pectoralis muscle and subcutaneous fat were analysed in cardiac short axis images to obtain mean T 1, T 2 and PD tissue values. The core body temperature {{was measured using}} a rectally <b>inserted</b> <b>thermometer.</b> The tissue-specific quantitative values {{were related to the}} body core temperature. Equations to correct for temperature differences were generated. RESULTS In a 3 D plot comprising the combined data of T 1, T 2 and PD, different organs/tissues could be well differentiated from each other. The quantitative values were influenced by the temperature. T 1 in particular exhibited strong temperature dependence. The correction of quantitative values to a temperature of 37  °C resulted in better tissue discrimination. CONCLUSION Postmortem MR quantification is feasible for soft tissue discrimination and characterization of thoraco-abdominal organs. This provides a base for computer-aided diagnosis and detection of tissue lesions. The temperature dependence of the T 1 values challenges postmortem MR quantification. Equations to correct for the temperature dependence are provided.

However, the English and American literature on the subject contains no reference to the occurrence of mesenteric infarction during hypothermia. A case {{is reported}} in which such an incident did occur, due to either mesenteric thrombosis or embolus. CASE REPORT A man aged 46 years, with malignant hypertension (blood pressure 240 / 180 mm Hg), was found to have a stenosed left renal artery. In order to improve the blood flow to the left kidney a lieno-renal arterial anastomosis was planned. It was decided to perform the operation under hypothermia to protect the kidney while its blood supply was cut off. The patient was dyspnoeic on moderate exertion and had been in left ventricular failure on several occasions, treated with hypotensive agents, digitalis and diuretics. The e. c. g. showed left ventricular hypertrophy and a possible previous infarct. Haemoglobin and white cell count were normal. Cold haemaglutinins precipi-tated heavily at 4 °C and faintly at 11 "C, but as this temperature range was far outside that to which it was intended to cool the patient, no significance was attached to this observation.
