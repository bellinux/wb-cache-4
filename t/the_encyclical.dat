5|$|Vix pervenit: On Usury and Other Dishonest Profit was an encyclical, {{promulgated by}} Pope Benedict XIV on November 1, 1745, which {{condemned}} {{the practice of}} charging interest on loans as usury. Because <b>the</b> <b>encyclical</b> was addressed to the Bishops of Italy, it is generally not considered ex cathedra. The Holy Office applied <b>the</b> <b>encyclical</b> to {{the whole of the}} Roman Catholic Church on July 29, 1836, during the reign of Pope Gregory XVI.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>encyclical</b> codified Church teachings which {{date back}} to early ecumenical councils, {{at a time when}} {{scholastic}} philosophy (which did not regard money as a productive input) was increasingly coming into conflict with capitalism.|$|E
5|$|The text of <b>the</b> <b>encyclical</b> was {{destroyed}} in several countries. In France, the ban on usury persisted until the French Revolution of 1789, the same year in which Turgot's Mémoire sur les prets d'argent, a defense of usury, was allowed to be published.|$|E

5|$|Pope John XXIII issued eight Papal Encyclicals {{during his}} five-year reign as Pope of the Roman Catholic Church, from his {{election}} on October 28, 1958 {{until his death}} on June 3, 1963. Two of his encylicals, Mater et magistra and Pacem in terris, are especially important. A Papal Encyclical is a letter sent by the Pope which is addressed to Roman Catholic bishops {{in a particular area}} or the whole world. Encyclicals may condemn errors, point out threats to faith and morals, exhort faithful practices, or provide remedies for present and future dangers to the church. The authority of <b>the</b> <b>encyclical</b> varies depending on the circumstances and is not necessarily ex cathedra. The title of a Papal Encyclical is usually taken from its first few words.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>encyclical</b> Divino afflante Spiritu, {{published}} in 1943, emphasized {{the role of}} the Bible. Pius XII freed biblical research from previous limitations. He encouraged Christian theologians to revisit original versions of the Bible in Greek and Hebrew. Noting improvements in archaeology, <b>the</b> <b>encyclical</b> reversed Pope Leo XIII's encyclical, which had only advocated going back to the original texts to resolve ambiguity in the Latin Vulgate. <b>The</b> <b>encyclical</b> demands a much better understanding of ancient Jewish history and traditions. It requires bishops throughout the Church to initiate biblical studies for lay people. The Pontiff also requests a reorientation of Catholic teaching and education, relying much more on sacred scriptures in sermons and religious instruction.|$|E

25|$|According to George Weigel, Paul VI named Archbishop Karol Wojtyła (later Pope John Paul II) to the commission, but Polish {{government}} {{authorities would}} not permit him to travel to Rome. Wojtyła had earlier defended the church's position from a philosophical standpoint in his 1960 book Love and Responsibility. Wojtyła's position was strongly considered and it {{was reflected in the}} final draft of <b>the</b> <b>encyclical,</b> although much of his language and arguments were not incorporated. Weigel attributes much of the poor reception of <b>the</b> <b>encyclical</b> to the omission of many of Wojtyła's arguments.|$|E

The document was signed by Pope Benedict on Christmas Day, 25 December 2005. <b>The</b> <b>encyclical</b> was promulgated a month later in Latin and was translated into English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish. It is the first encyclical to be published since the Vatican decided to assert copyright in the official writings of the pope.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a particular}} employment inference of recent Papal social thought, for a Western developed economy context. The Papal documents studied are Centesimus Annus (1991), Sollicitudo Rei Socialis (1987), and Laborem Exercens (1981). The first and shortest {{section of the}} paper outlines a number of principles from <b>the</b> <b>encyclicals</b> aiming to guide employment organisation and policy relevant to Western and all economies. To permit their full consideration, an illustration is given how implications affecting forms of employment organization might be drawn from {{just one of the}} principles [...] the right to private property ownership. Private property ownership rights are argued to be constrained in specific ways, to relate instrinsically to employment organization, and to underpin other principles emphasized in <b>the</b> <b>encyclicals,</b> such as <b>the</b> priority of labor over capital. A selection of recent non-official-Church Catholic Social Thought is compared with the approach here. Since <b>the</b> <b>encyclicals</b> deal with issues only at the level of principle, the paper notes cases where {{attempts have been made to}} apply some of the employment organizational implications in practice.
