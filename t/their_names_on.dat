5|$|In 1908, {{for reasons}} unknown, the Wanderers, despite having turned aside four challengers, did not record <b>their</b> <b>names</b> <b>on</b> the Cup. The next year, the Ottawa Senators added a second band onto the Cup. Despite the new room, the 1910 Wanderers and the 1911 Senators {{did not put}} <b>their</b> <b>names</b> <b>on</b> the Cup. The 1915 Vancouver Millionaires became the second team to engrave players' names, this time inside the bowl along its sides.|$|E
5|$|Although {{not much}} {{is known about}} Maya scribes, some did sign their work, both on {{ceramics}} and on stone sculpture. Usually, only a single scribe signed a ceramic vessel, but multiple sculptors {{are known to have}} recorded <b>their</b> <b>names</b> <b>on</b> stone sculpture; eight sculptors signed one stela at Piedras Negras. However, most works remained unsigned by their artists.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} three years of the awards, actresses were {{nominated}} as the best in their categories. At that time, all of their work during the qualifying period (as many as three films, in some cases) was listed after the award. However, during the 3rd ceremony held in 1930, only one of those films was cited in each winner's final award, even though each of the acting winners had two films following <b>their</b> <b>names</b> <b>on</b> the ballots.|$|E
5|$|An amateur, near shot-for-shot remake {{was made}} by Chris Strompolos, Eric Zala, and Jayson Lamb, then {{children}} in Ocean Springs, Mississippi. It took the boys seven years to finish, from 1982 to 1989. After production of the film, called , it was shelved and forgotten until 2003, where it was discovered by Eli Roth and acclaimed by Spielberg himself, who congratulated the boys on their hard work and said {{he looked forward to}} seeing <b>their</b> <b>names</b> <b>on</b> the big screen. Scott Rudin and Paramount Pictures purchased the trio's life rights with the goal of producing a film based on their adventures making their remake.|$|E
5|$|Another of Harrison's goals was {{to raise}} {{the morale of the}} {{workforce}} and locomotive engineers; crews were assigned to the same locomotives, and senior engineers were allowed to paint <b>their</b> <b>names</b> <b>on</b> their engines. When business declined in 1914 Harrison reduced his salary by 20percent, but introduced smaller and graduated cuts for other staff, with the smallest percentages at the lowest pay scales. Other efforts to improve morale included rewards for fuel efficiency and the improvement of safety, including stricter investigation of accidents.|$|E

5|$|The 1918 Millionaires {{eventually}} {{filled the}} band added by the 1909 Senators. The 1915 Ottawa Senators, the 1916 Portland Rosebuds and the 1918 Vancouver Millionaires all engraved <b>their</b> <b>names</b> <b>on</b> the trophy {{even though they}} did not officially win it under the new PCHA-NHA system. They had only won the title of the previous champion's league and would have been crowned as Cup champions under the old challenge rules. The winners in 1918, 1920 to 1923 did not put their winning team name on it.|$|E
5|$|The Pont du Gard {{has been}} a tourist {{attraction}} for centuries. The outstanding quality of the bridge's masonry led to it becoming an obligatory stop for French journeymen masons on their traditional tour around the country (see Compagnons du Tour de France), {{many of whom have}} left <b>their</b> <b>names</b> <b>on</b> the stonework. From the 18th century onwards, particularly after the construction of the new road bridge, it became a famous staging-post for travellers on the Grand Tour and became increasingly renowned as an object of historical importance and French national pride.|$|E
5|$|The obverse {{is similar}} to coins from Merovingian France, {{especially}} from the southern parts, as well as showing influences from Visigothic Spain. The reverse side, however, has no known predecessors in Merovingian or Visigothic coinage. Although by the late 6th century, Merovingian and Visigothic kings were putting <b>their</b> <b>names</b> <b>on</b> their coins, no surviving coins from either kingdom name a bishop. The design of the figure is derived from Byzantine imperial coins, and the cross itself is large and closely resembles an altar cross.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{arrival in}} the Sweetwater valley, the trail {{encounters}} {{one of the most}} important landmarks on the trail, Independence Rock. Independence Rock was named because settlers tried to reach it by July 4 (Independence Day in the United States) in order to help ensure that they will be at their destinations in California or Oregon before the winter snows come. Many of the travelers left <b>their</b> <b>names</b> <b>on</b> the rock, either carved or painted on with axle grease. It is estimated that more than 50,000 signatures were inscribed on Independence Rock. Other notable landmarks along the Sweetwater valley include Split Rock, Devil's Gate and Martin's Cove, where, in November 1856, the Martin Handcart Company was stranded by heavy snow until a rescue party from Salt Lake City arrived.|$|E

5|$|In Macau, {{three men}} {{break into a}} house, shoot a French woman (Sylvie Testud) and kill {{her husband and two}} children. The woman's father, Francis Costello (Johnny Hallyday), arrives to visit his {{daughter}} who is now suffering from serious injuries. She is nevertheless able to tell her father that there were three shooters and that she shot one of the killers in the ear. At a hotel, Costello meets Kwai (Anthony Wong), Chu (Lam Ka-Tung) and Fat Lok (Lam Suet), a trio of hitmen who are hired to murder the unfaithful wife of Triad crime boss George Fung (Simon Yam). After overhearing the murder in a hotel room, Costello reaches an unspoken agreement to walk away. Costello later tracks down Kwai's syndicate, hands them a stack of euros and his watch, and asks them to help him avenge his daughter's family's deaths. Before doing so though, he takes a Polaroid picture of each of the hitmen, and writes <b>their</b> <b>names</b> <b>on</b> the pictures so that he will not forget who they are. The four go to the apartment where the shooting occurred and work out what happened, the number of shooters and the weapons used.|$|E
5|$|In the past, some {{visitors}} {{would write}} <b>their</b> <b>names</b> <b>on</b> the Wall, or based upon various scriptural verses, would drive nails into the crevices. These practices stopped after rabbis determined that such actions compromised {{the sanctity of}} the Wall. Another practice also existed whereby pilgrims or those intending to travel abroad would hack off a chip from the Wall or take some of the sand from between its cracks as a good luck charm or memento. In the late 19th century the question was raised as to whether this was permitted and a long responsa appeared in the Jerusalem newspaper Havatzelet in 1898. It concluded that even if according to Jewish Law it was permitted, the practices should be stopped as it constituted a desecration. More recently the Yalkut Yosef rules that it is forbidden to remove small chips of stone or dust from the Wall, although it is permissible to take twigs from the vegetation which grows in the Wall for an amulet, as they contain no holiness. Cleaning the stones is also problematic from a halachic point of view. Blasphemous graffiti once sprayed by a tourist was left visible for months until it began to peel away.|$|E
