Originally, the producers were ordered to produce four clip show per season in order to meet episode limits imposed by the network. Fox network officials reasoned <b>that</b> <b>clip</b> shows could be produced at half the cost of a normal episode, but syndication rights could be sold at full price. The staff, however, felt such a large number of clip shows would alienate fans of the series.|$|E

25|$|Music may be memorized, {{or it may}} {{be carried}} on flip folders, which are held by lyres <b>that</b> <b>clip</b> onto the instruments. Having music memorized is usually {{considered}} an advantage for competitive bands, and at competitions, there is usually a penalty {{for the use of the}} sheet music on the field written into the scoring rubric. Practically, memorization prevents obstruction of vision caused by the folders. The memorization of music is usually a matter of pride for the marching band, however bands that regularly pull from expansive libraries and perform dozens of new works each season are more likely to utilize flip folders.|$|E

40|$|Adaptive {{histogram}} equalization (ahe) is a contrast enhancement method {{designed to be}} broadly applicable and having demonstrated effectiveness. However, slow speed and the overenhancement of noise it produces in relatively homogeneous regions are two problems. We report algorithms designed to overcome these and other concerns. We conclude <b>that</b> <b>clipped</b> ahe should become a method of choice in medical imaging and probably also {{in other areas of}} digital imaging, and <b>that</b> <b>clipped</b> ahe can be made adequately fast to be routinely applied in the normal display sequence...|$|R

25|$|Seed {{predation}} often {{occurs at}} contrasting plant ontogenic stages. Predispersal seed predation takes place when seeds {{are removed from}} the parent plant before dispersal, {{and it has been}} most often reported in invertebrates, birds, and in granivorous rodents <b>that</b> <b>clip</b> fruits directly from trees and herbaceous plants. Postdispersal seed predation arises once seeds have been released from the parent plant. Birds, rodents, and ants are known to be among the most pervasive postdispersal seed predators. Furthermore, postdispersal seed predation can take place at two contrasting stages: predation on the ‘‘seed rain’’ and predation on the ‘‘seed bank’’. Whereas predation on the seed rain occurs when animals prey on released seeds usually flush with the ground surface, predation on the seed bank takes place after seeds have been incorporated deeply into the soil. Both pre- and post-dispersal seed predation are extremely frequent in nature. However, fundamental differences occur between the two. Pre-dispersal predators are most often specialists, as {{they are more likely to}} adapt to clustered resources. Predator specialization requires that these animals utilize specific cues like plant chemistry (volatile compounds), color and size to attack seeds. In addition, specialization requires that the life cycle of the predator match the production of seeds by the host plant. Therefore, animals with shorter life span, like insects, are more common pre-dispersal predators. Common insect groups of pre-dispersal predators are Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera. For this reason, a greater diversity of predators feed on seeds prior to dispersal. Nevertheless, there are important vertebrate pre-dispersal predators, especially birds and small mammals.|$|E

The Fox network's reasoning was <b>that</b> <b>clip</b> shows cost half of what a normal episode cost to produce, but they could sell syndication rights at full price.

Heavy or draft horses are usually at least [...] high and can be as tall as [...] and weigh from about [...] Some miniature horses are no taller than [...] in adulthood. Sexual dimorphism is limited in equines. The penis of the male is vascular and lacks a bone (baculum). Equines are adapted for running and for traveling over long distances. Their dentition is adapted for grazing; they have large incisors <b>that</b> <b>clip</b> grass blades and highly crowned, ridged molars well suited for grinding. Males have spade-shaped canines ("tushes"), which can be used as weapons in fighting. Equines have fairly good senses, particularly their eyesight. Their moderately long, erect ears are movable and can locate the source of a sound.|$|E

[...] He concluded that [...] "The Golden Compass feels like an unfinished title. Chapters are disjointed and the attempts at narrative segues between scenes and tasks are a mess.
