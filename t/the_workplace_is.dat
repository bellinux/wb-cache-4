25|$|Workplace bullying, like {{childhood}} bullying, is {{the tendency}} of individuals or groups to use persistent aggressive or unreasonable behaviour against a co-worker. Workplace bullying can include such tactics as verbal, nonverbal, psychological, physical abuse and humiliation. This type of aggression is particularly difficult because unlike the typical forms of school bullying, workplace bullies often operate within the established rules and policies of their organisation and their society. Bullying in <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> <b>is</b> {{in the majority of}} cases reported as having been perpetrated by a manager and takes a wide variety of forms.|$|E

A trainee and a CEO who were female were both given a low status when displaying anger.

25|$|The third {{relationship}} in <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> <b>is</b> between employees and customers. Although it happens less frequently, it plays {{a significant role}} in the efficiency of the organization. If an employee has an unhealthy emotion at work, it will affect the quality of the service seriously. Lots of examples can be listed from our daily life, like customers are ignored by shop assistants, patients are shouted by nurses in the hospital and so on. On the other hand, customers might despise the employees, especially those working in blue-collar jobs, such as gas station assistants.|$|E
25|$|Statistical {{discrimination}} in <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> <b>is</b> unintentional {{discrimination based on}} the presumed probability that a worker will or will not remain with the company {{for a long period}} of time. Specific to women, since employers believe that women are more likely to drop out of the labor force to have kids, or work part-time while they are raising kids, this tends to hurt their chances for job advancement. They are passed up for promotions because of the possibility that they may leave, and are in some cases placed in positions with little opportunity for upward mobility to begin with based on these same stereotypes.|$|E
25|$|As <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> <b>is</b> {{changing}} {{to include more}} group-based systems, researching motivation within these groups is of growing importance. To date, {{a great amount of}} research has focused on the Job characteristic theory and the Goal-setting Theory. While more research is needed that draws on a broader range of motivation theories, research thus far has concluded several things: (a) semi-autonomous groups report higher levels of job scope (related to intrinsic job satisfaction), extrinsic satisfaction, and organizational commitment; and (b) developmentally mature teams have higher job motivation and innovation. Further, voluntarily formed work teams report high work motivation. Though research shows that appropriate goal-setting influences group motivation and performance, more research is needed in this area (group goals, individual goals, cohesiveness, etc.). There are inseparable mediating variables consisting of group cohesiveness, commitment, and performance. As the workplace environment calls for more and more teams to be formed, research into motivation of teams is ever-pressing. Thus far, overarching research merely suggests that individual-level and team-level sources of motivation are congruent with each other. Consequently, research should be expanded to apply more theories of motivation; look at group dynamics; and essentially conclude how groups can be most impacted to increase motivation and, consequently, performance.|$|E

25|$|Stressful working {{conditions}} {{can lead to}} three types of strains: Behavioral (e.g., absenteeism or poor performance), physical (e.g., headaches or coronary heart disease), and psychological (e.g., anxiety or depressed mood). Physical symptoms that may occur because of occupational stress include fatigue, headache, upset stomach, muscular aches and pains, weight gain or loss, chronic mild illness, and sleep disturbances. Psychological and behavioral problems that may develop include anxiety, irritability, alcohol and drug use, feeling powerless and low morale. The spectrum of effects caused by occupational stress includes absenteeism, poor decision making, lack of creativity, accidents, organizational breakdown or even sabotage. If exposure to stressors in <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> <b>is</b> prolonged, then chronic health problems can occur including stroke. An examination was of physical and psychological effects of workplace stress was conducted {{with a sample of}} 552 female blue collar employees of a microelectronics facility. It was found that job-related conflicts were associated with depressive symptoms, severe headaches, fatigue, rashes, and other multiple symptoms. Studies among the Japanese population specifically showed a more than 2-fold increase in the risk of total stroke among men with job strain (combination of high job demand and low job control). Those in blue-collar or manual labor jobs are more likely to develop heart disease compared to those in white-collar jobs. Along with the risk of stroke, stress can raise the risk of high blood pressure, immune system dysfunction, coronary artery disease. Prolonged occupational stress can lead to occupational burnout. Occupational stress can also disrupt relationships.|$|E
25|$|Workplace {{bullying}} {{is reported}} to be far more prevalent than perhaps commonly thought. For some reason, workplace bullying seems to be particularly widespread in healthcare organizations; 80% of nurses report experiencing workplace bullying. Similar to the school environment for children, the work environment typically places groups of adult peers together in a shared space on a regular basis. In such a situation, social interactions and relationships are of great importance to the function of the organizational structure and in pursuing goals. The emotional consequences of bullying put an organization at risk of losing victimized employees. Bullying also contributes to a negative work environment, is not conducive to necessary cooperation and can lessen productivity at various levels. Bullying in <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> <b>is</b> associated with negative responses to stress. The ability to manage emotions, especially emotional stress, seems to be a consistently important factor in different types of bullying. The workplace in general can be a stressful environment, so a negative way of coping with stress or an inability to do so can be particularly damning. Workplace bullies may have high social intelligence and low emotional intelligence (EI). In this context, bullies tend to rank high on the social ladder and are adept at influencing others. The combination of high social intelligence and low empathy is conducive to manipulative behaviour, such that Hutchinson (2013) describes workplace bullying to be. In working groups where employees have low EI, workers can be persuaded to engage in unethical behaviour. With the bullies' persuasion, the work group is socialized in a way that rationalizes the behaviour, and makes the group tolerant or supportive of the bullying. Hutchinson & Hurley (2013) make the case that EI and leadership skills are both necessary to bullying intervention in the workplace, and illustrates the relationship between EI, leadership and reductions in bullying. EI and ethical behaviour among other members of the work team have been shown to {{have a significant impact on}} ethical behaviour of nursing teams. Higher EI is linked to improvements in the work environment and is an important moderator between conflict and reactions to conflict in the workplace. The self-awareness and self-management dimensions of EI have both been illustrated to have strong positive correlations with effective leadership and the specific leadership ability to build healthy work environments and work culture.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the cutting}} edge of {{research}} pertaining to motivation in <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> <b>is</b> the integration of motivation and creativity. Essentially, according to Ambrose and Kulik, the same variables that predict intrinsic motivation are associated with creativity. This is a helpful conclusion in that organizations can measure and influence both creativity and motivation simultaneously. Further, allowing employees to choose creative and challenging jobs/tasks has been shown to improve motivation. In order to increase creativity, setting [...] "creativity goals" [...] can positively influence the process, along with allowing more autonomy (i.e., giving employees freedom to feel/be creative). Other studies have found that team support may enable more creativity in a group setting, also increasing motivation.|$|E

2500|$|The Fourth {{relationship}} in <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> <b>is</b> between the organization or its institution or its {{system and the}} employees. In the article of Andreas Liefooghe (2012), it notes {{that a lot of}} employees describe their organization as [...] "bully." [...] It is not environmental factors facilitating the bullying but it is the bullying itself. Tremendous power imbalance between the company and its employees enables the company to [...] "legitimately exercise" [...] their power, in the way of monitoring and controlling the employees, as a bully. The terms of the bullying [...] "traditionally" [...] imply to interpersonal relationship. Talking about bullying in interpersonal levels is legitimate, but talking about the exploitation, justice and subjugation as bullying by the organization would be [...] "relatively ridiculous" [...] or not taken as serious. Bullying is sometimes more than a purely interpersonal issue.|$|E
2500|$|The {{expression}} of anger {{is believed to}} be related to status, as anger is considered a status emotion. [...] Positive impressions of those who display anger are reserved for people who are stereotypically conferred a higher status. [...] A 2007 study found that male employees who were in a subordinate position in the workplace displayed anger toward higher status employees, while female employees in a subordinate position displayed anger toward higher status employees much less frequently. [...] This suggests that the stereotypical norm of men displaying anger carries over into the workplace, while the norm of women restraining displays of anger also carries over. [...] It also suggests that, although men in low level positions in the workplace possess a low status in this context, they may carry over the higher status that comes with their gender into the workplace. [...] Women do not possess this high status; therefore the low status that low level women possess in <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> <b>is</b> the sole status that matters.|$|E
2500|$|Workplace {{bullying}} is {{a persistent}} pattern of mistreatment from {{others in the}} workplace that causes either physical or emotional harm. [...] It can include such tactics as verbal, nonverbal, psychological, physical abuse and humiliation. This type of workplace aggression is particularly difficult because, unlike the typical school bully, workplace bullies often operate within the established rules and policies of their organization and their society. In the majority of cases, bullying in <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> <b>is</b> reported as having been by someone who has authority over their victim. However, bullies can also be peers, and occasionally subordinates. Research has also investigated {{the impact of the}} larger organizational context on bullying as well as the group-level processes that impact on the incidence and maintenance of bullying behaviour. Bullying can be covert or overt. It may be missed by superiors; it may be known by many throughout the organization. [...] Negative effects are not limited to the targeted individuals, and may lead to a decline in employee morale and a change in organizational culture.|$|E

2500|$|Gender {{equality}} in <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> <b>is</b> {{a major concern}} of many social activists, public officials, and academics, among others. Even in Developed Countries and wealthy democracies such as the United States there is concern of gender inequities in economic mobility for women. American President Barack Obama's Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was passed in response to concerns among Americans that women were receiving lower wages for equal work. Wages and wage equality with men are two common indicators of gender equality and opportunity within a formal market. Higher aggregate wages indicate that females are holding more productive, valued jobs which is considered indicative of social progress. Equal pay with men demonstrates a neutrality to gender within the workplace and may suggest functional fairness between female workers [...] and their male counterparts. Given these two indicators, wage statistics suggest that gender {{equality in}} terms of economic participation and the quality of formal economic opportunities are not high in many predominantly Muslim nations. In 2011, the World Economic Forum gathered information about the estimated earned income of women in 135 countries. Of these countries, Syria placed 134th in terms of earned annual income for women.|$|E
2500|$|For most people, {{irritation}} from formaldehyde {{is temporary}} and reversible, though formaldehyde can cause allergies and {{is part of}} the standard patch test series. In 2005–06, it was the seventh-most-prevalent allergen in patch tests (9.0%). [...] People with formaldehyde allergy are advised to avoid formaldehyde releasers as well (e.g., Quaternium-15, imidazolidinyl urea, and diazolidinyl urea). People who suffer allergic reactions to formaldehyde tend to display lesions on the skin in the areas that have had direct contact with the substance, such as the neck or thighs (often due to formaldehyde released from permanent press finished clothing) or dermatitis on the face (typically from cosmetics). Formaldehyde has been banned in cosmetics in both Sweden and Japan. The eyes are most sensitive to formaldehyde exposure: The lowest level at which many people can begin to smell formaldehyde is about 0.05 ppm and the highest level is 1 ppm. The maximum concentration value at <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> <b>is</b> 0.3 ppm. In controlled chamber studies, individuals begin to sense eye irritation at about 0.5 ppm; 5 to 20 percent report eye irritation at 0.5 to 1 ppm; and greater certainty for sensory irritation occurred at 1 ppm and above. While some agencies have used a level as low as 0.1 ppm as a threshold for irritation, the expert panel found that a level of 0.3 ppm would protect against nearly all irritation. In fact, the expert panel found that a level of 1.0 ppm would avoid eye irritation—the most sensitive endpoint—in 75–95% of all people exposed.|$|E
2500|$|According to a {{study on}} spirituality and {{performance}} in organizations, the increase in corporate meditation programs can also be linked to a complex paradigm shift in the structure and system of organizations. The changes in management include a shift from an economic focus to a balance of profits, quality of life, spirituality and social responsibility concerns. For the past 300 years, the mechanical paradigm shaped the economy where the main corporate objectives were to satisfy shareholders by increasing competition and exploitation. The new emerging business paradigm is called the [...] "Spiritual Movement" [...] and moves away from a materialistic to a more spiritual orientation. In this new paradigm, a company's competitive advantage resides in how much it invests in its human capital and the qualities of its employees. The shift in business paradigm's {{can be explained by}} the fact that the business world is more competitive, globalized and fast-pace than ever. The boundaries between work and home are blurred, where work has become central to people's lives and employees can be connected to their work whenever. The increase in the importance of work has led to an increase in stress and burnout. <b>The</b> <b>workplace</b> <b>is</b> a place where employees spend most of their lives, develop friendships, create value and make meaningful contributions to society. This means that they are looking for satisfaction beyond work. According to a report on emerging cultures, the shift in paradigm can also be explained by American demographics. [...] "The American adult population is divided into three groups, each with a different set of values and view of the world." [...] The [...] "Cultural Creatives," [...] whom constitute 24% of US adults are the newest and increasingly growing worldview. [...] "Their values align with ecological sustainability, globalism, women's issues, social conscience, self-actualization and spirituality". They reflect a major change that has been growing in American culture.|$|E
