40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} selective pressure of antibiotics on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and bacterial communities in manure-polluted aquatic environment. Three treatment groups were set up in freshwater-sediment microcosms: <b>tetracyclines</b> <b>group,</b> sulfonamides group and fluoroquinolones group. Sediment and water samples were collected on day 14 after treatment. Antibiotic concentrations, ARGs abundances and bacterial community composition were analyzed. Antibiotic concentrations were determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. ARGs abundances were quantified by real time quantitative PCR. Bacterial community composition was analyzed based on amplicon sequencing. Of the three classes of antibiotics analyzed in the treatment groups, accumulation amounts were tetracyclines> fluoroquinolone> sulfonamides in the sediment samples, while they were sulfonamides> fluoroquinolone> tetracyclines in the water samples. In the treatment groups, the relative abundances of some tet resistance genes (tet(W) and tet(X)) and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes (oqx(B) and aac(6 ’) -Ib) in sediment samples were significantly higher than those in the paired water samples. Tetracyclines significantly selected the bacterial classes including Gammaproteobacteria, Clostridia, and the genera including Salmonella, Escherichia/Shigella, Clostridium, Stenotrophomonas in sediment samples. The significant selection on bacterial communities posed by sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones was also observed. The results indicated that sediment may supply an ideal setting for maintenance and persistence of tet resistance genes (tet(W) and tet(X)) and PMQR genes (oqx(B) and aac(6 ’) -Ib) under antibiotic pollution. The results also highlighted that antibiotics significantly selected specific bacterial communities including the taxa associated with opportunistic pathogens...|$|E

Mice in the two bicyclol groups received bicyclol (300 mg/ kg) by gavage for 3 times in 12 h interval, meanwhile, those in the other groups received the equal amount of forming agents. Tetracycline (200 mg/kg) was then injected intraperitoneally to the mice in bicyclol <b>groups</b> and <b>tetracycline</b> <b>groups</b> 1 h after the last dose of bicyclol, and mice in control group received equal amount and pH of saline. The liver issues and blood samples from eyes were collected 6 h and 24 h after tetracycline injection for detection of the corresponding indicators. RT-PCR was performed to detect the gene expression of proliferation index (PCNA, cyclin D 1 and c-myc), Western blotting was performed to detect the expression of Cyclin D 1 in liver tissue, and immunohistochemistry was employed to detect the expression of PCNA and c-myc proteins. Results 　The expression level of PCNA gene 6 h after tetracycline injection in mice of <b>tetracycline</b> <b>group</b> was 43 % of that in control group, meanwhile the expression of protein also reduced obviously. Bicyclol remarkably inhibited the decrease of PCNA gene and protein expressions at early time (6 h) of fatty liver. In addition, the expression of cyclin D 1 gene in <b>tetracycline</b> 24 h <b>group</b> was 59 %, and the expression of c-myc was 5. 7 folds of that in control group. Bicyclol remarkably up-regulated the gene expressions of cyclin D 1 and c-myc 6 h after tetracycline injection, and up-regulated the protein expression of cyclin D 1 24 h after tetracycline injection. Conclusion　Bicyclol can enhance hepatocyte proliferation of mice with tetracycline-induced fatty liver by up-regulation of PCNA, cyclin D 1 and c-myc expression.

The total volumes of stool (mean +/- standard deviation) during a 6 -day period after treatment were significantly smaller in the <b>tetracycline</b> <b>group</b> (10. 5 +/- 8. 6 liters) than in the furazolidone group (20. 9 +/- 15. 9 liters) and the placebo group (19. 1 +/- 10. 5 liters) (P less than 0. 01). The duration of diarrhea and volumes of intravenous fluids were also significantly reduced in the <b>tetracycline</b> <b>group</b> (P less than 0. 05). However, {{there were no differences}} between the furazolidone and the placebo groups with regard to stool volume, intravenous fluid, and duration of diarrhea. Within 48 h of treatment, tetracycline significantly reduced the number of patients with positive stool cultures for V. cholerae (37 %) compared with furazolidone treatment (96 %) and the placebo (97 %) (P less than 0. 001). Although the <b>tetracycline</b> <b>group</b> had a significantly higher incidence (61 %) of bacteriologic relapse (negative stool cultures on days 2 and 3, followed by positive cultures afterward) compared with that in the furazolidone group (40 %) and the placebo group (33 %), this was not associated with clinical relapse.

METHODS: A total of 1803 inhabitants from 106 households of eight Gambian villages were randomized, in pairs, to receive either three doses of azithromycin at weekly intervals, or daily topical tetracycline over 6 weeks. Ocular examinations were conducted before treatment, and 2, 6 and 12 months after treatment. FINDINGS: Prior to treatment, 16 % of the study participants had active trachoma. Two months after treatment, the prevalence of trachoma was 4. 6 % and 5. 1 % in the azithromycin and the <b>tetracycline</b> <b>groups,</b> respectively (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1. 09; 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0. 53, 2. 02).

40|$|Background: Meatal {{stenosis}} is {{of common}} late complication of neonatal circumcision, albeit the appropriate post-operative care and conventional consumption of topical agents such as tetracycline. Nevertheless, its underlying etiology still remained vague. Lack of protective effects of foreskin and subsequent inflammation reaction due to chemical and mechanical irritation {{is thought to}} be the most probable cause. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of the medical records of the male neonates, were considered eligible who referred to our pediatric tertiary center  (Hazrat-e-Masumeh hospital, Qom city) for circumcision between May 2014 and April 2016. Neonates with severe phimosis and buried penis were excluded from the study. Based on the medical records the patients were divided into two groups. Patients were operated similarly, and then, those who received 1 % hydrocortisone ointment post-operatively (n= 91) and those who received the conventional treatment with tetracycline cream instead of hydrocortisone (n= 91). Results: The mean age of neonates was 19. 2 ± 3. 6 and 21. 4 ± 2. 1 days for <b>tetracycline</b> and hydrocortisone <b>groups,</b> respectively. Meatal stenosis has occurred in 27 (29. 67 %) patients of the <b>tetracycline</b> <b>group,</b> and 11 (12. 08 %) of the hydrocortisone group (P= 0. 008). Mean time to develop meatal stenosis in the <b>tetracycline</b> <b>group</b> was less than that of the hydrocortisone group (2. 3 ± 0. 4 vs. 3. 8 ± 0. 65 weeks, respectively, P= 0. 03). There was no adverse effect associated with application of 1 % topical ointment of hydrocortisone.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown {{that the majority of the}} soft and hard tissue destruction in periodontitis occurs due to activated host immune-inflammatory defence mechanisms in response to bacterial plaque. The importance of the host inflammatory response in periodontal pathogenesis presents opportunity for exploring new treatment strategies for periodontitis by means of host modulation.

40|$|Chronic {{periodontitis}} is {{a complex}} infection initiated by gram-negative bacteria which destroy the supporting structures of the tooth. Recently, it has been recognized {{that it is the}} host response to bacterial infection which causes greater destruction of the connective tissue elements, periodontal ligament and alveolar bone in periodontitis.

Aminoglycosides and antibiotics belonging to the <b>tetracycline</b> <b>group</b> showed good inhibitory effect {{with the majority of}} the strains being inhibited by 3. 12 μg/ml. Among the cephalosporins studied, cephradine and cephalexin were considerably less active than other members of this group. Cephapirin was the most active. This study suggests that prediction of the susceptibility of Haemophilus strains to cephalosporins, on the basis of one drug of this group tested alone, is likely to be hazardous. © 1975 Verlagsgesellschaft Otto Spatz.

40|$|Antibiotic {{resistance}} genes (ARGs) {{have been}} commonly reported {{due to the}} overuse worldwide of antibiotics. Antibiotic overuse disturbs the environment and threatens public human health. The objective {{of this study was}} to measure the residual concentrations of veterinary antibiotics in the <b>tetracycline</b> <b>group</b> (TCs), including <b>tetracycline</b> (TC) and chlortetracycline (CTC), as well as those in the sulfonamide group (SAs), including sulfamethazine (SMT), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and sulfathiazole (STZ). We also isolated the corresponding ARGs in the agroecosystem. Four sediment samples and two rice paddy soil samples were collected from sites near a swine composting facility along the Naerincheon River in Hongcheon, Korea. High performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) was employed with a solid-phase extraction method to measure the concentration of each antibiotic. ARGs were identified by the qualitative polymerase chain-reaction using synthetic primers. SAs and their corresponding ARGs were highly detected in sediment samples whereas TCs were not detected except for sediments sample # 1. ARGs for TCs and SAs were detected in rice paddy soils, while ARGs for TCs were only found in sediment # 2 and # 4. Continuous monitoring of antibiotic residue and its comprehensive impact on the environment is needed to ensure environmental health...|$|R
