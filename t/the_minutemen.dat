5|$|A {{deceased}} member, Brady was a bank-sponsored {{member of}} <b>The</b> <b>Minutemen</b> who {{was created for}} publicity purposes. He dies during a bank robbery in 1947 when his cape is caught in the bank's revolving doors, allowing the robbers to shoot him at point-blank range.|$|E
50|$|In December 2004, Simcox {{teamed with}} James Gilchrist to {{organize}} <b>the</b> <b>Minuteman</b> Project, which brought nationwide {{attention to the}} southern border. Some have accused <b>the</b> <b>Minuteman</b> members of being vigilantes, but supporters claim that {{there has never been}} a case of a member of <b>The</b> <b>Minuteman</b> Project physically harming anyone. However, the former Border Operations Manager of <b>The</b> <b>Minuteman</b> Project, Shawna Forde, was convicted of double murder after leaving it to form a splinter group.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1967, all Minuteman I A and B {{models were}} {{replaced}} by <b>the</b> <b>Minuteman</b> II. <b>The</b> upgrade was completed by June 1969. In 1975, the 564th SMS switched from <b>the</b> <b>Minuteman</b> II to <b>the</b> LGM-30G <b>Minuteman</b> III model.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Minuteman</b> Missile National Historic Site Boundary Modification Act (...) would amend <b>the</b> <b>Minuteman</b> Missile National Historic Site Establishment Act of 1999 {{to modify}} the {{boundary}} of <b>the</b> <b>Minuteman</b> Missile National Historic Site in South Dakota. [...] The bill would approve the transfer of administrative jurisdiction of about 29 acres of the Buffalo Gap National Grasslands from the Forest Service to the National Park Service (NPS). [...] The NPS would use the land for a visitor center, administrative site, and parking lot for <b>the</b> <b>Minuteman</b> Missile National Historic Site in South Dakota. [...] It was introduced into the 113th United States Congress.|$|R
5|$|A former Marine Lieutenant, {{he was one}} of {{the more}} active members of <b>the</b> <b>Minutemen,</b> having {{organized}} its formation. He died in a car accident in 1974 that left him decapitated, and is believed by some to be a form of suicide.|$|E
5|$|Although Uncle Tupelo {{broke up}} before it {{achieved}} commercial success, {{the band is}} renowned for {{its impact on the}} alternative country music scene. The group's first album, No Depression, became a byword for the genre and was widely influential. Uncle Tupelo's sound was unlike popular country music of the time, drawing inspiration from styles as diverse as the hardcore punk of <b>The</b> <b>Minutemen</b> and the country instrumentation and harmony of the Carter Family and Hank Williams. Farrar and Tweedy's lyrics frequently referred to Middle America and the working class of Belleville.|$|E
5|$|Anderson played {{four seasons}} of college {{basketball}} under head coach Steve Lappas at the University of Massachusetts Amherst with <b>the</b> <b>Minutemen.</b> He most notably was named Rookie of the Year for the Atlantic 10 Conference in 2002. He closed his college career at UMass as its second-best three-point shooter in school history, behind only Monty Mack. Anderson attended Lynn English High School in Lynn, Massachusetts before college, {{where he was}} one of the top basketball players in the Northeastern Conference.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Fairfield <b>Minuteman</b> {{is a local}} {{newspaper}} of Fairfield, Connecticut. Combined with <b>the</b> Westport <b>Minuteman,</b> {{both of which are}} owned by the Journal Register Company, <b>the</b> <b>Minuteman</b> has a combined readership of roughly 30,000.|$|R
2500|$|However, after <b>the</b> <b>Minuteman</b> Council {{approved}} its non-discrimination bylaw, it {{rejected the}} merit badge application of an openly gay individual whose {{membership in the}} BSA had previously been revoked in New Hampshire. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Minuteman</b> Council asserted that [...] "We will not accept anybody who has had his membership revoked by the national council." [...] The United Way ended financial support of <b>the</b> <b>Minuteman</b> Council {{as a result of}} the controversy.|$|R

5|$|Lyrically {{the songs}} {{reflected}} the band members' experiences {{growing up in}} Belleville. Farrar and Tweedy romanticized tales about unemployment, alcoholism, and the feeling {{of living in a}} small town in an effort to emulate the profundity of songwriters such as Woody Guthrie. Musically, No Depression was influenced by the start-stop musical pattern of <b>the</b> <b>Minutemen.</b> The cover of the album features a blurry photo of the band, taken by J. Hamilton, reminiscent of the albums released on Folkways Records.|$|E
5|$|Percy {{lost control}} of his men, and British {{soldiers}} began to commit atrocities to repay for the supposed scalping at the North Bridge and for their own casualties {{at the hands of}} a distant, often unseen enemy. Based on the word of Pitcairn and other wounded officers from Smith's command, Percy had learned that <b>the</b> <b>Minutemen</b> were using stone walls, trees and buildings in these more thickly settled towns closer to Boston to hide behind and shoot at the column. He ordered the flank companies to clear the colonial militiamen out of such places.|$|E
5|$|Barrett {{told the}} men to load their weapons but not to fire unless fired upon, and then ordered them to advance. Laurie ordered the British {{companies}} guarding the bridge to retreat across it. One officer then tried to pull up the loose planks of the bridge to impede the colonial advance, but Major Buttrick began to yell at the regulars to stop harming the bridge. <b>The</b> <b>Minutemen</b> and militia from Concord, Acton {{and a handful of}} Westford Minutemen, advanced in column formation, two by two, led by Major Buttrick, Lt. Col. Robinson, then Capt. Davis, on the light infantry, keeping to the road, since it was surrounded by the spring floodwaters of the Concord River.|$|E
50|$|The Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS) is an {{integral}} part of <b>the</b> <b>Minuteman</b> ICBM command and control system and provides a survivable launch capability for <b>the</b> <b>Minuteman</b> ICBM force if ground based Launch Control Centers are destroyed.|$|R
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>Minuteman</b> ICBM {{was first}} placed on alert, the Soviet Union {{did not have}} the number of weapons, accuracy, nor {{significant}} nuclear yield to completely destroy <b>the</b> <b>Minuteman</b> ICBM force during an attack. However, starting in the mid-1960s, the Soviets began to gain parity with the US and now had the potential capability to target and successfully attack <b>the</b> <b>Minuteman</b> force with an increased number of ICBMs that had greater yields and accuracy than were previously available. Studying the problem even more, SAC realized that in order to prevent the US from launching all 1000 <b>Minuteman</b> ICBMs, <b>the</b> Soviets did not have to target all 1000 <b>Minuteman</b> missile silos. <b>The</b> Soviets only needed to launch a disarming decapitation strike against <b>the</b> 100 <b>Minuteman</b> LCCs - <b>the</b> command and control sites - in order to prevent the launch of all Minuteman ICBMs. Even though <b>the</b> <b>Minuteman</b> ICBMs would have been left unscathed in their missile silos following an LCC decapitation strike, <b>the</b> <b>Minuteman</b> missiles could not be launched without a command and control capability. In other words, the Soviets only needed 100 warheads to fully eliminate command and control of <b>the</b> <b>Minuteman</b> ICBMs. Even if the Soviets chose to expend two to three warheads per LCC for assured damage expectancy, the Soviets would only have had to expend up to 300 warheads to disable <b>the</b> <b>Minuteman</b> ICBM force - far less than the total number of <b>Minuteman</b> silos. <b>The</b> Soviets could have then used the remaining warheads to strike other targets they chose.|$|R

5|$|The song's {{music video}} was filmed in various {{locations}} in Albuquerque and Portland. Among the areas filmed included the Rio Grande, junkyards, and near Mercer's home. The clip {{was directed by}} Lance Bangs, an associate of Spike Jonze. It features the band re-enacting the cover art of other bands' albums, including Zen Arcade and New Day Rising by Hüsker Dü, Let It Be by The Replacements, Moon Pix by Cat Power, Double Nickels on the Dime by <b>The</b> <b>Minutemen,</b> Squirrel Bait's first EP, Sonic Youth's Sister and Slint's Spiderland. Shooting in just two cities created logistical problems for album covers originally photographed {{in cities such as}} Los Angeles, Minneapolis, and Louisville. For the homage to Double Nickels on the Dime, the band had to track down the exact model of the car featured on the album cover (a Volkswagen Beetle), and Albuquerque happened to have a San Pedro Street, which is featured on a freeway sign on the original cover.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} quarter, the Red Raiders scored three touchdowns, {{followed}} by successful point after tries. <b>The</b> <b>Minutemen</b> scored once, on a 53-yard {{return of a}} Texas Tech fumble. The Red Raiders scored {{three times in the}} second quarter while shutting out <b>the</b> <b>Minutemen.</b> The score going into the half stood at 42–7.|$|E

50|$|It was re-activated on 1 December 1961 as an ICBM (Intercontinental Ballistic Missile) {{squadron}} {{assigned to}} the 341st Missile Wing at Malmstrom AFB, Montana. It was initially equipped with 50 LGM-30A Minuteman Is in early 1962, becoming SAC's first operational Minuteman ICBM squadron. It upgraded to <b>the</b> <b>Minuteman</b> IB in 1964 and <b>the</b> <b>Minuteman</b> IIF in 1967. It received control of LGM-30G Minuteman III silos from the inactivating 321st Strategic Missile Wing at Grand Forks AFB, North Dakota in 1996; <b>the</b> <b>Minuteman</b> IIs being retired.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Minutemen</b> have {{appeared}} in the ACHA National Tournament 14 times (tied for the all-time record), with top-four finishes in 2003, 2008, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2017. Their combined record in all games is 17–32–3.|$|E
5000|$|SSI {{circuits}} {{were crucial}} to early aerospace projects, and aerospace projects helped inspire {{development of the}} technology. Both <b>the</b> <b>Minuteman</b> missile and Apollo program needed lightweight digital computers for their inertial guidance systems. Although the Apollo guidance computer led and motivated integrated-circuit technology, it was <b>the</b> <b>Minuteman</b> missile that forced it into mass-production. <b>The</b> <b>Minuteman</b> missile program and various other Navy programs accounted for the total $4 million integrated circuit market in 1962, and by 1968, U.S. Government space and defense spending still accounted for 37% of the $312 million total production.|$|R
5000|$|Operations Branch {{successfully}} launched <b>the</b> first <b>Minuteman</b> III test missile from Silo 32 on 16 August 1968. That {{flight was}} followed by nine other test flights from Silo 32 and Silo 31 between 24 October 1968 and 13 March 1970 Though four of those later Minuteman III flights failed to meet their test objectives, the Operations Branch wrapped up <b>the</b> <b>Minuteman</b> III R&D flight test program with three highly successful flights from Silo 32 between 3 April and 28 May 1970. Though three more Minuteman III missiles were launched from Silo 32 on 16 September 2 and 14 December 1970, they were launched by Boeing for the Special Test Missile (STM) project - a post-R&D effort to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>Minuteman</b> III's performance and accuracy. Following <b>the</b> final <b>Minuteman</b> III launch on 14 December, <b>the</b> <b>Minuteman</b> Test Division continued to reduce its numbers, and {{only a handful of}} personnel were retained to complete <b>the</b> disposition of <b>Minuteman</b> equipment after <b>the</b> division was deactivated on 31 December 1970. The remaining personnel were reassigned to other duties, and the last of <b>the</b> <b>Minuteman</b> contractors departed in 1971.|$|R

25|$|In 2003 Watt {{released}} his own book on Minutemen, Spiels of a Minuteman, which contains all of Watt's song lyrics from <b>the</b> <b>Minutemen</b> era {{as well as}} the tour journal he wrote during Minutemen's only European tour with Black Flag, essays by former SST co-owner Joe Carducci, Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore, Blue Öyster Cult lyricist and longtime Watt hero Richard Meltzer, and illustrations by Raymond Pettibon that had been used in all of Minutemen's album artwork. The book, released by Quebec-based publisher , is published in English and French. In June 2015, Watt went on WTF with Marc Maron to discuss the legacy of <b>the</b> <b>Minutemen.</b>|$|E
25|$|Under {{head coach}} Bill Finn, and {{featuring}} early stars like three-time All-American Aleta Mills, Jacqui Phillips, Samatha Louras and goalie Becky Trudel, <b>the</b> <b>Minutemen</b> {{finished second in}} the East Region and received an autobid to the third-ever ACHA National Tournament, in Muskegon, Michigan. UMass performed well at nationals, finishing second in their four-team group after wins over Northern Michigan and St. Cloud State. While that outcome would have meant a trip to the semifinals under subsequent formats, in 2003 it meant that <b>the</b> <b>Minutemen</b> were dumped in the third-place game, where they dropped a decision to West Los Angeles College. Despite the disappointing finish, the program had announced its arrival in a way few have, before or since.|$|E
25|$|Milo Goes to College was {{released}} through New Alliance Records, an independent record label run by D.
