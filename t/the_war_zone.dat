5|$|By early 1916, the British {{blockade}} of Germany {{was beginning to}} have an effect on Germany and her imports. The Royal Navy had stopped and seized more cargo destined for Germany than the quantity of cargo sunk by German U-boats in the first submarine offensive. As a result, the German Imperial Navy began a second offensive against merchant shipping on 29 February. The final ground rules agreed upon by the German Admiralstab were that all enemy vessels in Germany's self-proclaimed war zone would be destroyed without warning, that enemy vessels outside <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>zone</b> would be destroyed only if armed, and—to avoid antagonizing the United States—that enemy passenger steamers were not to be attacked, regardless of whether in <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>zone</b> or not.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{successfully}} prosecuted his {{operations in}} the war against Paraguay, Inhaúma's leadership was encumbered by his hesitating and procrastinating behavior. While in command in <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>zone,</b> he became mentally exhausted and contracted an unknown disease. Seriously ill, Inhaúma returned to the national capital in early 1869 and died shortly thereafter. Although historical works have not given much coverage to Inhaúma, some historians regard him among the greatest of the Brazilian navy officers.|$|E

5|$|Another {{stress test}} for German–Japanese {{relations}} was the Russo-Japanese War of 1904/05, during which Germany strongly supported Russia. This circumstance triggered the Japanese foreign ministry to proclaim that any ship delivering coal to Russian vessels within <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>zone</b> would be sunk. After the Russo-Japanese War, Germany insisted on reciprocity {{in the exchange}} of military officers and students, and in the following years, several German military officers were sent to Japan to study the Japanese military, which, after its victory over the tsarist army became a promising organization to study. However, Japan's growing power and influence also caused increased distrust on the German side.|$|E

5|$|The Russian Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C³I) {{performed}} poorly {{during the}} conflict. The Russian communication systems were outdated, with a 58th Army commander allegedly making {{contact with his}} combat troops via a journalist-owned satellite phone. Without the modern GLONASS, precision-guided munitions could not be used; the US-controlled GPS was unavailable, since <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>zone</b> was blacked out. Due to the negligence of Russian defence minister, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles was not authorised; an RIA Novosti editorial said that Russian forces lacked reliable aerial-reconnaissance systems, once using a Tupolev Tu-22M3 bomber instead. However, Russian reconnaissance battalions and regiments were also deployed during the war. General Anatoly Nogovitsyn, deputy chief of the General staff, said that during the war, new weapons were not tried out.|$|E
5|$|Between October 1992 and March 1993, Sargsyan {{served as}} the Presidential Adviser on Defence Affairs and the Presidential Envoy to Border Regions of Armenia.

One year later, Johnny laments that he lost the love of his life, but he accepts that he can live inside the struggle between rage and love that has defined his life. With this acceptance comes the possibility of hope ("Whatsername").|$|E
5|$|In May 1982, three Phantoms from 29 Squadron were forward {{deployed}} to RAF Wideawake on Ascension Island to provide air {{cover for the}} RAF's operations during the Falklands War, replacing Harriers of 1 Squadron, which were transiting to <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>zone.</b> In August 1982, {{following the end of}} the conflict and the reconstruction of the runway, 29 Squadron detached a number of its aircraft to RAF Stanley to provide air defence for the Falkland Islands. Late the following year, 23 Squadron took up the role, remaining stationed there until October 1988, when they were replaced by 1435 Flight. To make up for the loss of an entire squadron from the UK Air Defence Region, the RAF procured 15 second-hand F-4J Phantoms that had previously been used by the US Navy. These aircraft were operated by 74 Squadron from 1984 until 1991, when they were replaced by FGR.2 Phantoms that had been released by other squadrons following their conversion to the Tornado. Initially, it was intended that Phantoms and Tornados serve alongside each other. A total of 152 Tornado F.3s were ordered for the RAF, enough to convert four squadrons of Phantoms and two of Lightnings, but insufficient to completely convert every air defence squadron. Both 23 and 29 Squadrons converted from the Phantom FGR.2 to the Tornado between 1987 and 1988, alongside the conversion of the final two remaining Lightning squadrons. The intention was to retain a pair of UK based Phantom squadrons at RAF Wattisham, alongside a pair of Tornado units at RAF Coningsby to provide air defence cover for the southern half of the UK Air Defence Region. Another two squadrons stationed in Germany would also be retained. The end of the Cold War however led to a more rapid withdrawal of Phantom units than had originally been planned; under the Options for Change defence review the Phantom was to be withdrawn from service, with the two Germany based units disbanded as part of the gradual run down of the RAF's presence, and a {{reduction in the number of}} air defence squadrons leading to the two UK based units being disbanded in late 1992. However, just prior to the final withdrawal of the Phantom, it was recalled operationally as a result of Operation Granby, the UK's participation in the First Gulf War, when a total of six aircraft from 19 and 92 Squadrons were forward {{deployed to}} provide air defence cover at RAF Akrotiri; this was to replace the Tornados that had been originally deployed there on exercise, and were subsequently sent to the Gulf region. Following their final withdrawal from service, with a few exceptions, the bulk of the RAF's FGR.2 fleet was scrapped. Over its service life, 37 FGR.2s were lost to crashes.|$|E

5|$|The 10th Battalion {{was back}} in action on 22–23 August as the Allied advance {{continued}} north of Proyart. The 10th Battalion was in a supporting role protecting the flank of the 1st Brigade. Upon learning of some difficulties due to German positions in Luc Wood, the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Maurice Wilder-Neligan, immediately tasked McCann, commanding two companies, to clear the area. Along with flanking troops, McCann cleared the wood, capturing 15 prisoners and four machine guns. The advance was then able to continue. McCann temporarily commanded the battalion for a week in late August, before being promoted to temporary major on 23 September. The battalion saw its last action {{of the war in}} late September. McCann again temporarily commanded the battalion for a week in early October, and was substantively promoted to major on 21 October. Shortly after this he attended a strategy and tactics course at the Staff College, Camberley, before returning to the battalion in November, when he was appointed as unit second-in-command. In early January 1919 he was appointed as commanding officer. He commanded the 10th Battalion until its disbandment in March, and was mentioned in Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig's final despatch of 16 March 1919. Also in March, he led a party of American delegates on a tour of <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>zone</b> and, in the following month, he headed the 3rd Brigade contingent in the Anzac Day march through London. On 3 May he was invested with his Distinguished Service Order and the bar to his Military Cross at Buckingham Palace. Later that month he embarked for Australia, and arrived back in Adelaide in June. He was admitted to Keswick Repatriation General Hospital on his return, and was discharged from the AIF on 8 September 1919. Two of McCann's brothers also served in the AIF, with one being killed in action. In addition to the decorations previously mentioned, McCann was also issued with the 1914–15 Star, British War Medal, and Victory Medal for his service during the war.|$|E
