5|$|During a {{night out}} in {{the one of the}} Zones – the cordoned off zone of {{decaying}} ghettos surrounding the City of London – Mike introduces Chris to journalist Liz Linshaw, who is also Mike's former mistress. Before they leave the Zones, Mike brutally executes several gang members who attempt to steal his car. Back at work, Mike brings Chris in to use contacts and analysis from his prior firm to assist into a project regarding propping up the ageing Colombian dictator General Hernan Echevarria. With Shorn's contract due for renewal they are challenged by competing agencies Nakamura and Acropolitic. The challenge is settled by a driving duel in which the Shorn team eliminates the two competing teams. Chris' profile is greatly increased with this victory, including appearances on TV and magazines as the latest star from a line of Shorn executives. As Chris becomes famous for his driving performance, he begins an affair with Liz Linshaw. With Echevarria's son, Francisco, who is aligned with a competing American firm, preparing to take over, Chris believes that a long-time rebel leader might be a better option than Francisco. Vincente Barranco, the rebel leader chosen by Chris, is signed to a contract with Shorn and brought to London <b>to</b> <b>shop</b> <b>for</b> arms to bring his small force the resources they need to overthrow Hernan before Francisco takes over. However, other Shorn executives sabotage Chris's efforts by arranging for Barranco to overhear a Shorn executive negotiate with the Echevarrias. When challenged by Barranco that he is not truly committed to his cause, Chris reacts by spontaneously beating Hernan to death in a conference room. Shorn concocts a coverup and pins Hernan's death on an otherwise unknown terrorist group. The killing is also concealed from most of Shorn's employees, but the senior partner of CI agrees that while a completely unorthodox act, it's the sort of rule bending which is sometimes needed to return the maximum for their clients. While his actions convince Barranco that he is in fact committed to his side, Chris is removed from the Columbia job which is handed over to a senior partner, Hamilton, who takes a more pragmatic view and moves to align with Hernan's son.|$|E

25|$|Bharuch {{has always}} been prosperous because of its {{location}} on the Narmada River. Although water tends to be scarce in Gujarat, one never finds difficulty in getting water in Bharuch.

People from these small villages come to Bharuch when they want <b>to</b> <b>shop</b> <b>for</b> new clothes, or make a major purchase.

25|$|This {{downward}} trend {{has been demonstrated}} by the conflicts between various agencies and levels of government. This has allowed wood traders <b>to</b> <b>shop</b> <b>for</b> export clearance among the authorities that regulate it. As {{a result of this}} bribery to open periodic trade windows, large-scale exports of illegal precious woods clear customs without much difficulty. Because of the incredibly lucrative nature of recent trades, reports have indicated that government officials have significantly increased the price of export certificates to make more money for themselves. This however has not stopped exporters from re-using single-use export certificates for two or three containers of rosewood. Furthermore, some of the certificates and authorizations from various government agencies bear titles found nowhere in any legal text, such as permis de ramassage and permis de carbonisation (collection permit and carbonization permit respectively). Such authorizations are not supported by and clearly conflict with Malagasy law.|$|E
25|$|Under 50% of the municipality’s {{population}} is economically active, but {{of these very}} few are unemployed. Commerce and services employ {{the largest number of}} people followed by construction and mining. Agriculture is extremely limited due to the very rugged terrain. However, some crops of sorghum, alfalfa, peanuts and fruits are produced. Livestock is produced on a very small scale and includes cattle, goats and sheep. Mining is the economic activity that spurred the founding of the city. However, extraction of minerals today is minimal, with gold and silver ores almost exhausted. Kaolin and lead are still mined. Principle mining companies includes Las Torres, Santa Fe de Guanajuato and El Cubo. The most important segments of the economy now are tourism and commerce. The city’s rich cultural and artistic heritage, along with its colonial area constructions, are what attract visitors. For the rural areas around the city, it is the place <b>to</b> <b>shop</b> <b>for</b> supplies not available at home. This includes foods, auto parts and service, banking services and more.|$|E

40|$|A {{steady stream}} of {{research}} {{over the past few}} decades has focused on store and shopping mall patronage and consumers’ associated enjoyment of the shopping experience. Based on previous research, the sources of shopping enjoyment were identified as <b>shopping</b> <b>to</b> socialize, <b>shopping</b> <b>for</b> bargains, <b>shopping</b> <b>for</b> gratification, <b>shopping</b> <b>for</b> entertainment, <b>shopping</b> <b>for</b> others, <b>shopping</b> <b>to</b> browse, <b>shopping</b> <b>for</b> exercise and <b>shopping</b> <b>for</b> sensory stimulation. The objective of this study was to investigate gender differences in the sources of shopping enjoyment. Data were collected through self-administered questionnaires distributed at a large metropolitan shopping centre in the eastern suburbs of Pretoria. The findings indicate significant gender differences on all the sources of shopping enjoyment except ‘shopping for entertainment’. This study contributes to the current literature and provides valuable information to South African retailers, specifically with regard to marketing and promotional strategies aimed at male and female shoppers separately. Suggestions for future research are offered. [URL]...|$|R

500|$|In 1926, he {{was signed}} by the Detroit Tigers of the American League(AL), and was {{assigned}} {{to play for the}} Kinston Eagles of the Virginia League. Shortly afterward, he was promoted to the Columbus Senators of the American Association, and in 1928 he posted a [...]333batting average with them. His performance that season earned him an American Association All-Star position. During the season, he personally asked Detroit's owner, Frank Navin, if the organization had a plan in place to bring him up to the Tigers. Navin told him to be patient and return to Columbus. When the season concluded, another Columbus catcher, Hugh McMullen, was called up to the major leagues, but to the Cincinnati Reds instead of the Tigers. Confused as to who actually owned his contract, Ferrell inquired with the Reds about his status with the organization, and was again told to return to Columbus. After reading through his contract, he believed he was being unfairly held in the minor leagues, so he petitioned the Commissioner of Baseball, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, to grant him a hearing. It was discovered that Columbus owner, Joseph Carr, had been shopping Ferrell's contract, receiving offers as high as $50,000 (...) , though none were formally presented on paper. Navin protested to Landis, claiming he was unaware of what Carr was doing. After the Commissioner completed his investigation, he determined that the Tigers and Reds had colluded to keep Ferrell in the minor leagues, and directed Carr <b>to</b> <b>shop</b> <b>for</b> buyers. This move by the two teams effectively hid him from the other major league teams' draft rights to increase Ferrell's sale price. This was a common, although illegal, practice during this era, so Landis declared Ferrell a free agent, allowing him to sign a contract with any team he chose, except the Tigers. After receiving offers from many major league clubs, he signed a contract with the St. Louis Browns of the AL for $25,000 (...) [...]|$|E

[...] The band traveled out to Vig's Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin, recording from April 2nd to 6th, 1990, [...] Most of the basic song arrangements were completed by that time, but Cobain was still working on lyrics and the band was unsure of which songs to record.

[...] The original request from his mother is [...] "six farm eggs, a cake for tea, a pound of pears, and don't forget the bacon." [...] Along with the dog, he is accompanied on his trip by a butterfly. In order to avoid forgetting items, the boy recites his mother's list to himself. Throughout his trip to the store, the boy sees items along the way that play tricks with his memory, and items on his list one-by-one become substituted with other goods. [...] "Six farm eggs" [...] initially becomes [...] "Six fat legs" [...] then [...] "Six clothes pegs", and [...] "A cake for tea" [...] initially becomes [...] "A cape for me" [...] then [...] "A rake for leaves", and [...] "A pound of pears" [...] initially becomes [...] "A flight of stairs" [...] then [...] "A pile of chairs". By the end of his trip, the boy has forgotten the initial items requested, and supplants them in his mind with [...] "Six clothes pegs, a rake for leaves, a pile of chairs, and don't forget the bacon". Then he goes to the junk shop and says to a merchant there, [...] "Six clothes pegs, a rake for leaves, and a pile of chairs please!". The merchant in the junk shop assists the boy in compiling to this odd list. While travelling back to his home, he remembers the original items and corrects his mistakes. Then on the way home, he says to himself, [...] "Six farm eggs, a cake for tea, and a pound of pears". However, he still forgets to acquire bacon when he gets home. And finally, he says, [...] "I FORGOT THE BACON!". Finally, the final panel depicts the child carrying a basket and a coin purse, taking his dog attached to a leash, and do an en route; probably to purchase the bacon which he forgot.|$|E
