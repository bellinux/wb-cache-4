There is a town centre residents' parking permit scheme in operation. Council-owned car parks exist {{in a number of}} locations in Ludlow to cater for much of the long-stay car parking.

25|$|Ludford is a {{separate}} civil parish, with its own parish council, and covers the adjoining places of Ludford, Foldgate, Steventon, <b>the</b> <b>Sheet</b> <b>and</b> Rocks Green. Until 1901 an area of land {{at the foot of}} Old Street, called Holdgate Fee, was a detached part of Ludford parish in the town itself. Ludlow Castle was a parish of its own, contained within the castle's walls and the immediate hillside; it was abolished in 1901 and ceded to Ludlow's civil parish. Other than Ludford, the only other civil parish in the present-day neighbouring Ludlow is Bromfield.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of the Domesday Book, Ludford came within the Herefordshire hundred of Wolphy, whilst Steventon and the Sheet (as well as Ludlow, by way of it being part of Stanton Lacy at the time) came within Culvestan, a Shropshire hundred {{originating}} in Anglo-Saxon times but which ended in the reign of Henry I. Steventon, <b>the</b> <b>Sheet</b> <b>and</b> Holdgate Fee (see section below) became part of Munslow hundred after Culvestan's dissolution, as did Ludlow. The Herefordshire element of the parish remained as part of Wolphy hundred throughout until its transfer to Shropshire in 1895, by which time the hundreds of England had become defunct.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the Domesday Book survey, the area was part of the large Stanton parish and manor, a {{possession}} of Walter de Lacy. Neither Ludlow nor Dinham are mentioned in the Book, compiled in 1086, although the Book recorded manors and not settlements per se. The Book does record a great number of households and taxable value for Stanton, perhaps suggesting that any early settlement by the nascent castle was being counted. Neighbouring places Ludford, <b>the</b> <b>Sheet</b> <b>and</b> Steventon do feature in the Book, as they were manors, proving that they were well-established places by the Norman conquest. The manor of Stanton came within the hundred of Culvestan, but during the reign of Henry I this Saxon hundred was merged into the new Munslow hundred.|$|E
25|$|The philatelic {{literature}} has long stated that {{seven of the}} stamps have been lost or destroyed through theft or mishandling. However, in 2007 a copy came to light {{that had not been}} seen since Eugene Klein broke up <b>the</b> <b>sheet,</b> <b>and</b> was offered for auction that June. The number of lost stamps then became six. Several others have been damaged, including one that was sucked into a vacuum cleaner. Apparently Green's wife mailed one which, while recovered, is the only cancelled sample. Indeed, no Jenny invert is in pristine condition, because Klein lightly penciled a number on the back of each stamp (from 1 through 10 in the top row to 91 through 100 in the bottom row) so that its original position on the sheet could be identified. Only five examples survive, in fact, in never hinged condition. One of these is the locket copy, which, however has another condition problem: a corner crease at the bottom right probably inflicted while it was being enclosed behind glass.|$|E

500|$|For cosmological redshifts of [...] {{additional}} Doppler redshifts and blueshifts due to {{the peculiar}} motions of the galaxies relative to one another cause a wide scatter from the standard Hubble Law. The resulting situation can be illustrated by the Expanding Rubber Sheet Universe, a common cosmological analogy {{used to describe the}} expansion of space. If two objects are represented by ball bearings and spacetime by a stretching rubber sheet, the Doppler effect is caused by rolling the balls across the sheet to create peculiar motion. The cosmological redshift occurs when the ball bearings are stuck to <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> the sheet is stretched.|$|E

Writing for Allmusic, Steve Huey {{described}} the song as [...] "the ultimate grunge anthem" [...] and [...] "a crucial and vastly influential touchstone {{in the evolution}} of the grunge movement, virtually defining the term". For its northwestern rock exhibit, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame requested the song's original lyrics sheet. Since it did not exist—Arm briefly considered making a fake one by writing down the lyrics, crumpling <b>the</b> <b>sheet,</b> <b>and</b> then burning the edges—the band instead donated Turner's old Big Muff pedals.|$|E

500|$|While Earth's {{magnetic}} field is roughly teardrop-shaped, Jupiter's is flatter, more closely resembling a disk, and [...] "wobbles" [...] periodically about its axis. The {{main reasons for}} this disk-like configuration are the centrifugal force from the co-rotating plasma and thermal pressure of hot plasma, both of which act to stretch Jupiter's {{magnetic field}} lines, forming a flattened pancake-like structure, known as the magnetodisk, at the distances greater than 20RJ from the planet. The magnetodisk has a thin current sheet at the middle plane, approximately near the magnetic equator. The magnetic field lines point away from Jupiter above <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> towards Jupiter below it. The load of plasma from Io greatly expands {{the size of the}} Jovian magnetosphere, because the magnetodisk creates an additional internal pressure which balances the pressure of the solar wind. In the absence of Io the distance from the planet to the magnetopause at the subsolar point would be no more than 42RJ, whereas it is actually 75RJ on average.|$|E
500|$|In 1919, H. W. Evans {{recorded}} {{the existence of}} a similar custom which had existed in Solva, Pembrokeshire circa 1840, during his mother's childhood. He stated that this custom entailed the use of what he termed a [...] "Mari Lwyd", furthermore providing a drawing of it using his mother's recollections as a basis, although was unaware of how this costume had been used. According to Evans' description, this Mari Lwyd consisted of a sheet that had been sewn together along two adjacent sides to make a cone, which was then stuffed with hay and decorated with buttons for eyes and harvest gloves for ears, thus resembling an animal's snout. An individual could conceal themselves under <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> use a hay fork inserted into the hay to hold it up. A similar custom appears in an account from 1897, in which an entity known as the Bwca Llwyd ("Grey Bogy") was described; it involved an imitation horse's head being made from canvas and stuffed with hay, being carried about using a hay fork on All Hallow's Eve.|$|E
500|$|When {{he heard}} of Eisenhower's posture, Nixon's {{happiness}} {{at what he}} had finally been convinced was a [...] turned to fury, and he stated that if the speech did not satisfy the general, {{nothing he could do}} would. He called in his secretary, Rose Mary Woods, and dictated a telegram to the RNC resigning from the ticket. As Woods left the room with her notes, Chotiner stopped her, took <b>the</b> <b>sheet,</b> <b>and</b> ripped it up. While Chotiner understood Nixon's rage, he felt that the resignation was premature. The campaign manager urged Nixon simply to allow the public wave of support to pressure Eisenhower. He suggested that instead of going to Wheeling as Eisenhower had requested, that they resume the train tour in Missoula, Montana. Nixon sent Eisenhower a curt acknowledgment of his telegram, and a suggestion that they meet the following week in Washington, D.C. Chotiner then called Summerfield, telling him that Nixon felt he had been abused enough, and would not meet with Eisenhower until Summerfield was able to promise, on his word of honor, that the senator would be confirmed as nominee at that meeting.

On May 14, Robey went to the post office to buy the new stamps, and as he wrote later, when the clerk brought out a sheet of inverts, [...] "my heart stood still".
