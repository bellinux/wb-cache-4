5|$|According to medieval scholar Richard Zeikowitz, the Green Knight {{represents}} {{a threat to}} homosocial friendship in his medieval world. Zeikowitz argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrator</b> of the poem seems entranced by the Knight's beauty, homoeroticising him in poetic form. The Green Knight's attractiveness challenges the homosocial rules of King Arthur's court and {{poses a threat to}} their way of life. Zeikowitz also states that Gawain seems to find Bertilak as attractive as the narrator finds the Green Knight. Bertilak, however, follows the homosocial code and develops a friendship with Gawain. Gawain's embracing and kissing Bertilak in several scenes thus represents not a homosexual but a homosocial expression. Men of the time often embraced and kissed and this was acceptable under the chivalric code. Nonetheless, the Green Knight blurs the lines between homosociality and homosexuality, representing the difficulty medieval writers sometimes had in separating the two.|$|E
5|$|Midway {{through the}} poem, {{there is a}} split between the two actions of the poem: the first {{attempts}} {{to identify with the}} nightingale and its song, and the second discusses the convergence of the past with the future while experiencing the present. This second theme is reminiscent of Keats's view of human progression through the Mansion of Many Apartments and how man develops from experiencing and wanting only pleasure to understanding truth as a mixture of both pleasure and pain. The Elysian fields and the nightingale's song {{in the first half of}} the poem represent the pleasurable moments that overwhelm the individual like a drug. However, the experience does not last forever, and the body is left desiring it until the narrator feels helpless without the pleasure. Instead of embracing the coming truth, the narrator clings to poetry to hide from the loss of pleasure. Poetry does not bring about the pleasure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrator</b> original asks for, but it does liberate him from his desire for only pleasure.|$|E
5|$|On {{a flight}} {{home from a}} {{business}} trip, the Narrator meets Tyler Durden, a soap salesman with whom he begins to converse after noticing the two share {{the same kind of}} briefcase. After the flight, the Narrator returns home to find that his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion. With no one else to contact, he calls Tyler, and they meet at a bar. After a conversation about consumerism, outside the bar, Tyler chastises the Narrator for his timidity about needing a place to stay. Tyler requests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Narrator</b> hit him, which leads the two to engage in a fistfight. The Narrator moves into Tyler's home, a large dilapidated house in an industrial area of their city. They have further fights outside the bar on subsequent nights, and these fights attract growing crowds of men. The fighting eventually moves to the bar's basement where the men form a club ("Fight Club") which routinely meets only to provide an opportunity for the men to fight recreationally.|$|E
50|$|At the end, when <b>the</b> <b>narrator</b> compares {{himself to}} Jesus on the cross, {{there is also}} <b>the</b> {{parallel}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrator's</b> actions will {{be the cause of}} further bloodshed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} written and {{directed}} by Stefan Prehn and Jörg Wagner. Konstantin Graudus plays the role of Klaus, and Egon Hoegen is <b>the</b> <b>narrator.</b> It adds to the air of authenticity <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrator's</b> voice is well known from road safety films, such as [...] "Der 7. Sinn".|$|R
40|$|This essay {{investigates the}} {{narration}} in Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre by applying narratologist Great Olson’s model of unreliable narration to Jane, <b>the</b> novel’s <b>narrator.</b> Further, <b>the</b> novel discusses how Jane’s reliability affects {{the portrayal of}} the character Bertha Mason. <b>The</b> essay argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrator’s</b> characterization of Bertha Mason is deliberately misleading...|$|R

25|$|The 1995 film The Usual Suspects reveals <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrator</b> {{had been}} deceiving another character, {{and hence the}} audience, by inventing stories and {{characters}} from whole cloth. The character {{is seen as a}} weak, humble, and quiet criminal but it is later found by the audience that he is the fabled crime boss Keyser Söze.|$|E
5000|$|Seymenliyska stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> novel {{uses the}} same voice {{regardless}} of which of the characters are speaking. Sometimes characters speak directly to the reader. Dwight Garner wrote <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrators</b> [...] "contradict one another {{as if they were}} talking heads in an early Spike Lee movie." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kirkus Reviews {{reviewed}} the episode positively, writing, [...] "This volume begins so thunderously <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrators</b> seem more like frenetic tour guides than friendly companions, pulling readers {{along at a}} breakneck pace. Riordan supplies them with his trademark wisecracking voice and explores themes of power, responsibility, family, love and loyalty as the tale hurtles along." ...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the song}} {{continues}} to mention <b>that</b> both <b>the</b> <b>narrator's</b> wife and stepdaughter had children by <b>the</b> <b>narrator</b> and his father, respectively, <b>the</b> <b>narrator</b> actually becomes [...] "his own grandpa" [...] once his father marries the woman's daughter.|$|R
25|$|Birds {{were common}} love-gifts in the Classical world, and several {{scholars}} have speculated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrator</b> {{gave it to}} the woman; this might explain the poet's identification with the sparrow and his fond lament for the bird in Catullus 3. The biting it does in line 4 ties in with Catullus 8, line 18 (cui labella mordebis).|$|E
25|$|The story unfolds as a first-person {{narrative}} and contains many references (see below) to real people, places, literary works and philosophical and cultural concepts, besides some fictional or ambiguous ones which {{contribute to the}} plot development. It is divided into part one, part two, and a postscript. Events and facts are revealed roughly in the order <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrator</b> becomes aware of them or their relevance. The timing of events in Borges's first-person story is approximately from 1935 to 1947; the plot concerns events going {{back as far as}} the early 17th century and culminating in a postscript set in 1947.|$|E
25|$|Mickey Curtis said, {{also in a}} Criterion Collection interview, that he did {{not think}} he was a good actor, but Ichikawa said he just needed to act naturally. Ichikawa had heard that Curtis was very thin, so he decided to use him, as the {{characters}} in the story have eaten very little. Ichikawa specifically told each actor how he wanted them to react, and would not rehearse. Ichikawa expressed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrator</b> (Tamura) could not be a cannibal because then he would have crossed the ultimate low. Ichikawa consulted with his wife, Natto Wada, and they decided against having him eat human flesh. As a result, Tamura never eats any in the film because his teeth are falling out.|$|E

50|$|Purity and Innocence - {{these are}} {{represented}} by snow in the story. The time the couple shared at the house is considered pure, innocent and without fault; the emotions of <b>the</b> <b>narrator</b> are encompassed by the snow. This is substantiated by <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrator's</b> emotions for her former lover, and of the time spent at the house, are not evoked by simply revisiting that place, but by the crocuses slight resemblance of the snow.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> fire <b>that</b> destroys <b>the</b> <b>narrator’s</b> house symbolizes <b>the</b> <b>narrator’s</b> [...] "almost {{complete}} moral disintegration". The only remainder is {{the impression}} of Pluto upon the wall, which represents his unforgivable and incorrigible sin.|$|R
25|$|Structurally, {{there are}} three {{significant}} pieces to the narrative, which does not flow in a strictly biographical manner. The novel opens with a statement of veracity, where the author claims to be writing no fiction and no pedantic history. She claims to be an eyewitness and to be writing without any embellishment or theme, relying solely upon reality. What follows is a description of Surinam itself and the South American Indians there. She regards the locals as simple {{and living in a}} golden age (the presence of gold in the land being indicative of the epoch of the people themselves). It is only afterwards <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrator</b> provides the history of Oroonoko himself and the intrigues of both his grandfather and the slave captain, the captivity of Imoinda, and his own betrayal. The next section is in the narrator's present; Oroonoko and Imoinda are reunited, and Oroonoko and Imoinda meet the narrator and Trefry. The third section contains Oroonoko's rebellion and its aftermath.|$|E
25|$|Although Athey and Alarcon {{focus on}} the greatness of Imoinda’s character, they also {{illustrate}} {{the importance of the}} narrator as a white woman. Because the novel is mediated by a white woman and Imoinda is portrayed as having European features, the text “uses slavery, rape, and dismemberment to foreground an economic competition for the black female body and to outline an implicit competition between black, white, and indigenous females”. The authors believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrator</b> attempts to illustrate competition between the women in the novel and the significant role that Imoinda plays throughout the novel. Similarly to Athey and Alarcon, Margaret W. Ferguson illustrates the competition amongst females in the novel. In Juggling the Categories of Race, Class and Gender: Aphra Behn’s Oroonoko, Ferguson states that Behn creates “a textual staging of the implicit competition between the white English female author and the black African female slave-wife-mother-to-be”. Ferguson explains that the competition between the narrator and Imoinda arises out of the desire for Oroonoko’s body and its ability to produce something extraordinary.|$|E
25|$|The Baker, his Wife, and Little Red Ridinghood {{get lost}} in the woods and find Cinderella's family and the Steward, who reveal that the castle was set upon by the Giant. The Witch arrives as well, {{bringing}} news that the Giant has destroyed the village and the Baker's house. Suddenly, thunderous footsteps are heard and the Giant appears. To the shock of all, this Giant is a woman who has come from the second beanstalk and is the widow of the Giant that Jack killed by chopping down the beanstalk. Her booming voice proclaims that she wants Jack's blood in revenge. To satisfy the Giantess, the group realizes they must give her someone, but are unable to decide on whom until they realize <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Narrator</b> is still commenting on the actions from the sidelines. Everyone offers her the narrator as a sacrifice, but he convinces them how lost they would be without him. Nevertheless, the Witch throws him into the Giantess's arms and he is killed upon being dropped. Jack's mother finds the group and aggressively defends her son, angering the Giantess, and the Steward clubs Jack's mother to quiet her, inadvertently killing her. As the Giantess leaves to search for Jack, Rapunzel runs into her path and is trampled, to the horror of the Witch and her Prince ("Witch's Lament").|$|E

5000|$|Traditionally, third-person {{narration}} is {{the most}} commonly used narrative mode in literature. It does not require <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrator's</b> existence be explained or developed as a particular character, as with a first-person narrator. It thus allows a story to be told without detailing any information about <b>the</b> teller (<b>narrator)</b> of <b>the</b> story. Instead, a third-person narrator is often simply some disembodied [...] "commentary" [...] or [...] "voice", rather than a fully developed character. Sometimes, third-person narration is called the [...] "he/she" [...] perspective.|$|R

500|$|Kenny also {{provided}} {{the voice of}} Gary, SpongeBob's meowing sea snail, and the narrator in the episode. According to him, [...] "It was always Steve's intention <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrator</b> be a nod to his beloved Jacques Cousteau." [...] Kenny described Cousteau's voice as [...] "very dispassionate, very removed, very flatline, even when he’s describing something miraculous and beautiful." [...] At first, they found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrator</b> [...] "just sounds bored," [...] so they decided that he [...] "has to sound a little fun and playful." [...] Kenny said, [...] "'Eet ees {{the most amazing thing}} I have ever seen I have ever seen in my life.' We found that after a while we had to make the narrator a little more playful than that." ...|$|E

5000|$|Geoffrey Yarlott {{points out}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrator's</b> {{description}} of his scenery and condition [...] "presents {{a clearer picture of}} what rapport with nature means than do the majority of Coleridge's formal Theistic passages. He writes now with his eye upon the object rather than the clouds, and with natural feelings. Where, earlier, he had seemed too much upon the stretch, as though trying to compel acceptance, he writes now with relaxed and easy confidence." ...|$|R
40|$|In Three Guineas Woolf {{includes}} five {{photographs of}} her masculine world: the army, lawyers, professors and church leaders which Woolf 'resists' with unpublished photographs: <b>the</b> <b>narrator's</b> memories of Spanish Civil War photographs. Where the public photographs erase individuality, the absent photographs encourage an alternative and radical politics. In private life Woolf {{was an active}} photographer very conscious of the links between memory, subjectivity and photography.

500|$|Poe says <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrator</b> {{is a young}} scholar. Though this is not {{explicitly}} stated in the poem, it is mentioned in [...] "The Philosophy of Composition".

500|$|The DVD release {{includes}} a second disc with {{four hours of}} additional interviews, deleted scenes, and productions stills. A reviewer from Flight Journal, feels the DVD package will connect with an audience of actual and aspiring restorers of military combat aircraft, which {{sometimes referred to as}} warbirds. [...] It notes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrator,</b> Michael Dorn, is a warbird owner and pilot.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the heavy}} tone, humor is prominent. [...] The work is {{conscious}} {{of its own}} creation—Green's drawing of it frames the narrative proper and there are constant reminders of it throughout. [...] Green patterned the opening after those featuring the Crypt-Keeper in EC Comics' Tales from the Crypt series from the 1950s. [...] Green used the adult Binky as the narrator of the captions and {{as a way to}} tie together the past and present timeframes. There is a disconnect in <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrator</b> refers to his younger self as [...] "he". [...] Other references to comics include a Sinstopper's Guidebook, which alludes to Dick Tracy's Crimestopper's Textbook and a cartoon by Robert Crumb in the background.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrators</b> in Dubliners rarely mediate, which means that there are limited {{descriptions}} of their thoughts and emotions, a practice said to accompany narratorial invisibility where <b>the</b> <b>narrator</b> sees instead of tells. While some point to Joyce's use of free indirect discourse {{as a way to}} understand his characters, he often obscures the reliability of his characters {{in a way that would}} make any kind of analysis very difficult. As Richard Ellmann has argued, [...] "Joyce claims importance by claiming nothing" [...] His characters' personalities can only be observed because they are not explicitly told.|$|R
