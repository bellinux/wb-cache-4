Nonetheless, I could not totally tear myself away from baseball while I attempted the important task of trying to absorb and summarize the many issues raised. I, therefore, adopted the traditional baseball shorthand: the box score. Basically, I had suggested two ideas: (1) dyspareunia did not really fit the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) criteria for a sexual dysfunction; (2) dyspareunia fit better as a pain disorder. My box score was instructive. Only 3 out of 18 commentators <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> me concerning both ideas while 5 out of 18 disagreed with me on both.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the level of}} agreement and applicability of the EULAR recommendations {{for the role of}} the nurse in the management of chronic inflammatory arthritis in Portugal. Methods: Nurses from all Portuguese rheumatology centers were invited to fill-in a questionnaire addressing the level of agreement (1 =strongly disagree to 5 =strongly agree) and the level of confidence (1 =no confidence to 5 =complete confidence) in the applicability of each of the recommendations. Comparisons were established between subgroups of nurses. Results: A total of 75 nurses (85 % female; mean (SD) of 3. 9 (4. 1) years of practice, 32 % with some type of training in rheumatology) participated in the study. The mean level of agreement with the recommendations was 4. 8 (SD 0. 3). The level of confidence in their full applicability was 3. 6 (SD 0. 8).

Aims: The aim of the following study is to determine {{the knowledge}} intern doctors have about prescribing errors and circumstances contributing to making them. Settings and Design: A structured questionnaire was distributed to intern doctors in National Hospital Abuja Nigeria. Subjects and Methods: Respondents gave information about their experience with prescribing medicines, {{the extent to which they}} <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> the definition of a clinically meaningful prescribing error and events that constituted such. Their experience with prescribing certain categories of medicines was also sought. Statistical Analysis Used: Data was analyzed with  Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 17 (SPSS Inc Chicago, Ill, USA). Chi‑squared analysis contrasted differences in proportions; P < 0. 05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results: The response rate was 90. 9 % and 27 (90 %) had < 1 year of prescribing experience. 17 (56. 7 %) respondents <b>totally</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> the definition of a clinically meaningful prescribing error. Most common reasons for prescribing mistakes were a failure to check prescriptions with a reference source (14, 25. 5 %) and failure to check for adverse drug interactions (14, 25. 5 %).

40|$|Chicory (Cichorium intybus) accumulates {{caffeic acid}} esters with {{important}} significance for human health. In this study, {{we aim at}} {{a better understanding of}} the biochemical pathway of these bioactive compounds. Detailed metabolic analysis reveals that C. intybus predominantly accumulates caftaric and chicoric acids in leaves, whereas isochlorogenic acid (3, 5 -diCQA) was almost exclusively accumulated in roots. Chlorogenic acid (3 -CQA) was equally distributed in all organs. Interestingly, distribution of the 4 compounds was related to leaf age. Induction with methyljasmonate (MeJA) of root cell suspension cultures results in an increase of 3 -CQA and 3, 5 -diCQA contents. Expressed sequence tag libraries were screened using members of the BAHD family identified in arabidopsis and tobacco as baits. The full-length cDNAs of five genes were isolated. Predicted amino acid sequence analyses revealed typical features of BAHD family members. Biochemical characterization of the recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli showed that 2 genes encode HCTs (hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferases, HCT 1 and HCT 2) whereas 3 genes encode HQTs (hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferases, HQT 1, HQT 2 and HQT 3). These results <b>totally</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> the phylogenetic analysis done with the predicted amino acid sequences. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of gene expression indicated that HQT 3, HCT 1 and HCT 2 might be more directly associated with CQA accumulation in cell culture in response to MeJA elicitation. Transient expression of HCT 1 and HQT 1 in tobacco resulted in a higher production of 3 -CQA. All together these data confirm the involvement of functionally redundant genes in 3 -CQA and related compound synthesis in the Asteraceae family...|$|R

His years of experience as a detective give him keen insight on criminal behavior which serves the MCD well while working cases. He is often mentoring the younger detectives in his unit whether he wants to or not. Respecting Provenza's many years experience as a seasoned homicide detective, Captain Raydor often asks Provenza for his assessment of a case or incident. When Raydor first takes over the squad, she and Provenza clash often as Provenza feels he should be in charge and she barely outranks him. He also doesn't like her policy of deal-making. However, as the show goes on, he grows to respect her and acts as a fatherly figure to her adopted son Rusty. In one early episode, when Rusty accuses Raydor of not caring about him, Provenza berates him, telling him he may not like Raydor, but she clearly cares very deeply about Rusty. Provenza's words cause Rusty to realize his mistake and make amends with Raydor. As the show goes on, Provenza gets more supportive of Raydor, occasionally referring to her by her first name and comforting her at times.

This study aimed to evaluate benzodiazepine prescribing behaviour and attitudes in general practitioners practising in Chiang Mai and Lampoon, Thailand. Methods Questionnaire survey of general practitioners in community hospitals, to estimate: i) use of benzodiazepines for anxiety/insomnia, panic disorder, depression, essential hypertension, and uncomplicated low back pain and ii) views on the optimal duration of benzodiazepine use. Results Fifty-five of 100 general practitioners returned the completed questionnaires. They reported use of benzodiazepines for anxiety/insomnia (n = 51, 93 %), panic disorder (n = 43, 78 %), depression (n = 26, 43 %), essential hypertension (n = 15, 27 %) and uncomplicated low back pain (n = 10, 18 %). Twenty-eight general practitioners would prescribe benzodiazepines for non-psychiatric conditions, 17 for use as muscle relaxants. Seventy-five per cent, 62 % and 29 % of the general practitioners <b>agreed</b> or <b>totally</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> the use of benzodiazepines for insomnia, anxiety and depression, respectively. Practitioners agreed that prescribing should be less than one week (80 %); or from 1 week to 1 month (47 %); or 1 to 4 months (16 %); or 4 to 6 months (5 %) or more than 6 months (2 %). Twenty-five general practitioners (45 %) accepted that they used benzodiazepines excessively in the past year. Conclusion A considerable proportion of general practitioners in Chiang Mai and Lampoon, Thailand inappropriately use benzodiazepines for physical illnesses, especially essential hypertension and uncomplicated low back pain. However, almost half of them thought that they overused benzodiazepines. General practitioner's lack of time, knowledge and skills should be taken into account in improving prescribing behaviour and attitudes. </p...|$|R

I also <b>totally</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the authors that no gold standard tool exists for determining nutritional status. However, I still could not grasp some points in their article. The authors concluded that they “can use Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) and Nutritional Screening Initiative Checklist (NISC) methods in the elderly, depending on the facilities an...|$|E
40|$|Statement of Problem: Bitewing {{radiograph}} is {{the main}} reference for diagnosis of proximal and recurrent caries. There is no software for gathering and analyzing radiologists’ opinion {{in the field of}} caries detection on digital bitewing radiograph (DBR). Objectives: The main aim {{of this study is to}} introduce the first windows application that could be used for marking caries on DBR. This software is called Dental Caries Marking Software (DCMS). The second aim is to create the first DBR caries dataset to be used for future software development projects in the field of automatic caries detection; also gathering and documenting the disagreements and critiques regarding DCMS. Materials and Methods: DCMS has been designed and implemented by the researchers of this study. This software is divided into two parts. The first part is DCMS writer that is used for gathering the user’s opinion and The second part is DCMS analyzer that is used for reading and analyzing the user’s opinion file. Eight radiologists with different experiences used DCMS for marking dental caries on 200 DBR, 50 of which were repeated twice for assessing the accuracy of each radiologist. Results: A total of 3833 points were marked by 8 users on 150 non repetitive DBR. Only 35 points were marked similarly by 8 users; in other words, 8 users <b>totally</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> 4 % of the caries points. According to 50 repetitive DBR, the maximum accuracy of users was 69 % and the minimum was 50 %. Conclusions: There is significant debate over the diagnosis of caries on DBR; therefore, for unifying the radiologist’s opinions, the need for intelligent caries detection software is apparent. DCMS is useful software for gathering caries data. Moreover, the use of conventional display monitor has negative impacts on accurate diagnosis of caries on DBR...|$|R
5000|$|Slavophiles {{declared}} Tolstoy their [...] "" [...] {{and pronounced}} War and Peace [...] "the Bible {{of the new}} national idea". Several articles on War and Peace were published in 1869-70 in Zarya magazine by Nikolai Strakhov. [...] "War and Peace {{is the work of}} genius, equal to everything that the Russian literature has produced before", he pronounced in the first, smaller essay. [...] "It is now quite clear that from 1868 when the War and Peace was published the very essence of what we call Russian literature has become quite different, acquired the new form and meaning", the critic continued later. Strakhov was the first critic in Russia who declared Tolstoy's novel to be a masterpiece of level previously unknown in Russian literature. Still, being a true Slavophile, he could not fail to see the novel as promoting the major Slavophiliac ideas of [...] "meek Russian character's supremacy over the rapacious European kind" [...] (using Apollon Grigoriev's formula). Years later, in 1878, discussing Strakhov's own book The World as a Whole, Tolstoy criticized both Grigoriev's concept (of [...] "Russian meekness vs. Western bestiality") and Strakhov's interpretation of it.Among the reviewers were military men and authors specializing in the war literature. Most assessed highly the artfulness and realism of Tolstoy's battle scenes. N. Lachinov, a member of the Russky Invalid newspaper staff (#69, April 10, 1868) called the Battle of Schöngrabern scenes [...] "bearing the highest degree of historical and artistic truthfulness" [...] and <b>totally</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> the author's view on the Battle of Borodino, which some of his opponents disputed. The army general and respected military writer Mikhail Dragomirov, in an article published in [...] (The Military Almanac, 1868-70), while disputing some of Tolstoy's ideas concerning the [...] "spontaneity" [...] of wars and the role of commander in battles, advised all the Russian Army officers to use War and Peace as their desk book, describing its battle scenes as [...] "incomparable" [...] and [...] "serving for an ideal manual to every textbook on theories of military art." ...|$|R

For an n-dimensional {{complete}} connected Riemannian man-ifold M with sectional curvature KM ≥ 1 and diameter diam(M) > pi 2, and {{a closed}} connected totally geodesic submanifold N of M, if there exist points x ∈ N and y ∈ M satisfying the distance d(x, y) > pi 2 then N is homeomorphic to a sphere. We also give a counterexam-ple in 2 -dimensional {{case to the}} following problem: let M be an n-dimensional complete connected Riemannian manifold with KM ≥ 1 and rad(M) > pi 2, whether does the “antipodal ” map A of M restricted to a complete <b>totally</b> geodesic submanifold <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the “antipodal” map of M? 1...|$|R
