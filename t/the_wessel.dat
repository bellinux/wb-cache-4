5|$|Across {{northern}} Australia, Banksia dentata {{has been}} recorded as far west as the King Leopold Ranges in the western Kimberley through the Northern Territory and extending south to Katherine Gorge and into Queensland, where it is found on the Cape York Peninsula to {{as far south as}} Cooktown. Off the coast, it {{has been recorded}} from Groote Eylandt and <b>the</b> <b>Wessel</b> Islands, as well as Melville and Bathurst Islands. It also extends onto the Aru Islands, where it is found around Trangan, and New Guinea, where it ranges in the south from Merauke east to Port Moresby, and around Bulolo and Mount Mau. It is the only Banksia species not endemic to Australia. As much of its range is in remote and poorly surveyed country, it is possible that it is found more widely than has been recorded. Pollen samples indicate it has been present on the Torres Strait Islands over the past 8000 years, though it has not been a prominent component of the island flora.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Lam was {{the strongest}} storm to strike Australia's Northern Territory since Cyclone Monica in 2006. It formed from the monsoon trough on February12 in the Coral Sea. For much of its duration, the system moved westward due to a ridge to the south. The system crossed over the Cape York Peninsula and moved into the Gulf of Carpentaria, whereupon it {{gradually}} organized due to warm waters and favorable outflow. On February16, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) classified it as a Category1 on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and gave it the name Lam. The storm intensified further while drifting toward <b>the</b> <b>Wessel</b> Islands, developing an eye and strengthening to the equivalence of a minimal hurricane on February18. It strengthened to reach maximum sustained winds of 185km/h (115mph) early on February19 before turning to the southwest, making it a Category4 cyclone. That day, it made landfall on Northern Territory between Milingimbi and Elcho Island at peak intensity, and it rapidly weakened over land. About six hours after Lam moved ashore, Cyclone Marcia struck Queensland as a Category5 cyclone, marking {{the first time on}} record that two storms of Category4 intensity struck Australia on the same day.|$|E
5|$|Within {{six hours}} of its {{classification}} as Tropical Low 13U, the system developed a central dense overcast, which is an organized area of convection around the center. At 18:00UTC on February16, the BoM upgraded the low to a Category1 on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale, naming it Lam. At that time, the BoM anticipated the cyclone would intensify to peak 10 minute sustained winds of 185km/h (115mph) within 72 hours, which proved very accurate. Also at 18:00UTC on February16, the JTWC began classifying the system as Tropical Cyclone 12P. Early on February17, an eye feature began forming within the convection. That day, Lam moved quicker to the west-northwest and slowed its rate of strengthening as it approached <b>the</b> <b>Wessel</b> Islands. Early on February18, the eye became better defined, moving over Cape Wessel. At 06:00UTC that day, the BoM upgraded Lam to a Category3 Severe Tropical Cyclone with 10 minute winds of 120km/h (75mph), equivalent to a minimal hurricane.|$|E
