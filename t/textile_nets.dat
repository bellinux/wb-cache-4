40|$|Optical fiber-based sensors " {{embedded}} " in functionalized carbon structures (FCSs) and <b>textile</b> <b>net</b> structures (TNSs) {{based on}} alkaline-resistant glass are introduced {{for the purpose}} of structural health monitoring (SHM) of concrete-based structures. The design aims to monitor common SHM parameters such as strain and cracks {{while at the same time}} acting as a structural strengthening mechanism. The sensor performances of the two systems are characterized in situ using Mach-Zehnder interferometric (MZI) and optical attenuation measurement techniques, respectively. For this purpose, different FCS samples were subjected to varying elongation using a tensile testing machine by carefully incrementing the applied force, and good correlation between the applied force and measured length change was observed. For crack detection, the functionalized TNSs were embedded into a concrete block which was then exposed to varying load using the three-point flexural test until destruction. Promising results were observed, identifying that the location of the crack can be determined using the conventional optical time domain reflectometry (OTDR) technique. The embedded sensors thus evaluated show the value of the dual achievement of the schemes proposed in obtaining strain/crack measurement while being utilized as strengthening agents as well...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{terminology}} and relationship is something I first came across when researching cloth and skins in the societies of prehistoric Europe. I wanted {{to understand the}} relationship between animal skins, linen and wool <b>textiles,</b> <b>netting</b> and twined cloth, yet I found there was no adequate way of describing these as a group of related materials. I was faced with quite separate books and journals on “cloth” or “textiles” from those on “skins” or “leather”. The content of these publications were usually defined by raw materials, technology or style. Such a separation makes it difficult to {{understand the relationship between}} these materials at any given time or place. From this problem, I recognized the value of classifying these related materials by their physical similarity and pattern of use. To do this I have used the term cloth-type material to refer to all flexible, thin sheets of material that can be wrapped, folded and shaped, but excluding materials related through structure, technology or raw material that do not share these qualities. This classification is significant to consider how cloth-type materials have the potential to be used in similar ways, yet through cultural values and choices have distinct roles and values...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the 7 -day prevalence of low-back pain (LBP; i. e., pain within the preceding week of the survey) and identified associated factors, including working posture, for a population of fishing net assembly workers. LBP {{is a serious problem}} in manual work with high prevalence and affects worker absenteeism. A cross-sectional survey study was conducted among <b>textile</b> fish <b>net</b> industrial workers using a structured questionnaire (hand delivered by researchers and independently completed by workers). The 7 -day prevalence of LBP in this study was 68. 6 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 65 to 72 %). Work factors significantly related to LBP included prolonged standing and walking. Workers 35 years old or greater {{were significantly more likely to}} experience LBP within the past 7 days preceding the survey than were those 34 years old or less (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj] = 4. 9; 95 % CI: 2. 4 to 10. 3; p =. 0001). Other significant factors associated with LBP included posture position, specifically stooping (ORadj = 1. 6; 95 % CI: 1. 0 to 2. 3; p =. 033), lifting (ORadj = 1. 6; 95 % CI: 1. 1 to 2. 4; p =. 025), and high concentration jobs (ORadj = 1. 9; 95 % CI: 1. 3 to 2. 7; p =. 001), respectively. LBP among <b>textile</b> fish <b>net</b> workers is a serious problem meriting ergonomic evaluation and design of control measures for reducing worker exposure to risk factors. Work characteristics were more significantly associated with LBP than were individual characteristics. Factories need to consider adjusting work conditions to prevent worker low-back injuries.

40|$|At present {{there is}} vast scope for metal <b>textiles,</b> welded <b>nets</b> {{and other special}} {{products}} applied in practically all branches of industry (the automobile, aviation, foodstuffs, chemical, rubber and building industries). Metal textiles are also used for decorative purposes (Dancing House and the National Theatre in Prague, etc.). As in all branches of industry we need unconventional materials for the best application. The producers must be sure that all their products have no defects, faults or other undesired properties. Our research work was devoted to the new application of wolfram wires. We solved a possibility to create cloth from wolfram wires. The best property of wolfram is its thermal resistance and high strength. These properties are needed for application in cosmos industry. Wolfram wire finds the usage especially in composites as is for example the composite where wolfram fabric is an armature and copper is matrix. For development and effective usage of composites {{it is necessary to}} recognize the properties of wolfram and possibilities to create cloth by weaving. This paper is therefore devoted to wolfram wires and their characteristics and possibility how to weave and how to use them as composites...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} Sino-US and Sino-EU {{safeguard}} agreements on US, China and world cotton and textile sectors are investigated using a partial equilibrium model. The effects are {{compared to a}} free trade scenario under {{the provisions of the}} Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC). The two agreements capping Chinese textile exports would decrease China's textile and apparel exports, production and domestic consumption by an average 1. 57 percent, 0. 63 percent and, 0. 32 percent respectively. The safeguard agreements cause an increase in the U. S. cotton textile price index and a slight decrease in U. S. <b>net</b> <b>textile</b> imports and textile consumption. The agreements cause a decrease in the world cotton price and the quantity of cotton traded, but these trends reverse at safeguard expiration. The results generally support the view that the safeguard agreements forestall the effects of free trade in textiles and apparel rather than creating long lasting shifts in the textile trade.

30|$|Clothing can {{be treated}} with anti-agents to keep {{mosquitoes}} from arriving or encouraging, on the other hand, with fast acting aerosol spray of the pyrethroid gathering, for example, permethrin. These recent mixes does not repulse the mosquitoes yet permit them to reach with the fabric and aggravate or killing them before they {{figure out how to}} bolster. The application of anti-agents to dress and different fabrics is desirable over skin application {{on the grounds that it}} diminishes the probability of hypersensitive responses. Former USSR have been developed a vest that claimed as anti-mosquito garment which consist of long sleeves made from wide mesh materials with 0.5  cm fibres thick (Rozendaal 1997). Study by Shannon identifies that garment piece with defensive pieces of clothing adjusted to be worn by outdoorsmen give protection against mosquitoes and different arthropods without any repellent treatment on the fabric. The garment comprises the multilayer of fabric consist of outer and inner layers which are connected at the seams (Shannon 1988). The upholsteries and outdoor textile items as listed on the Table  1 are existing products that have been developed to be used as individual outdoorsmen, housewife and also family. Most of protective mosquito textiles were treated using DEET or Permethrin by spraying the repellents from a pressurized can or by dipping it in the aqueous emulsion. For the netting jackets head nets, the materials are made from a blend of polyester/cotton, which being treated with DEET for easy absorption of the mosquito agent. The disadvantage of the netting jacket is that the structure of the jacket which is made of a wide mesh can be easily entangled. Another limitation is the netting materials must be wrapped in a plastic bag when not in use. Another example of mosquito repellent associated with fabric is the detachable patches with Velcro strips, press buttons or adhesive sticker. The treated patches can be easily removed and do not have a direct contact with the skin, therefore provides safety protection against mosquito Hammocks are made from textile materials for resting and sleeping, especially in jungle areas by outdoormens. It will be hung onto the tree or anything that is tall enough to keep off the ground from soil, crawling insect, snake, scorpions and anything small insects. However, hammock does not protect users from the flying insect such as mosquitoes. Mosquitoes often attack hammock user from the lower part of the hammock where the body presses the textile. There are a few suggestions to make hammock more protective against mosquito. Application of repellent such as spraying to the lower part of the hammock may avoid the mosquito to get near. A more economical method which requires a less repellent agent is by attaching the netting materials such as a piece of cloth which has been treated with repellent agent at the lower part of the hammock. This method can provide partial protection from biting mosquitoes. Another way for long lasting protection is to impregnate the whole hammock with the repellent. Another protective mosquito <b>textiles</b> are mosquito <b>nets.</b> The traditional netting materials are made from raffia (palm fibre), linen or hemp compared to the modern net which made from cotton and man-made fibre such as nylon, polyester or polyethylene. The mesh size of mosquito nets is between 1.2 and 1.5  mm, (if more that 2  mm most mosquitoes can enter). The structure of the netting materials can be woven or knitted. In terms of colour, white color is more preferred as mosquitoes that entered the nett can be easily noticed compared to a darker colour netting. For more protection, the mosquito net {{can be treated}} with mosquito repellent agent during the production as it can act as physical barrier to the entry of the mosquitoes (Rozendaal 1997).|$|R
