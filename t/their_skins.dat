5|$|From {{the time}} of the Great Depression until the {{formation}} of the New Zealand Rabbit Board in 1954, rabbits became a major pest in the area, and rabbiters were employed to keep the creatures under control. The trapping of rabbits and auctioning of <b>their</b> <b>skins</b> in Dunedin became a minor but important part of the Catlins area's economy during this time.|$|E
5|$|Some nemerteans, such as L. longissimus, absorb {{organic food}} in {{solution}} through <b>their</b> <b>skins,</b> which {{may make the}} long, slim bodies an advantage. Suspension feeding is found only among the specialized symbiotic bdellonemerteans, which have a proboscis but no stylet, and use suckers to attach themselves to bivalves.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasing}} {{population in}} towns near the Everglades hunted in the area. Raccoons and otters {{were the most}} widely hunted for <b>their</b> <b>skins.</b> Hunting often went unchecked; in one trip, a Lake Okeechobee hunter killed 250alligators and 172otters. Water birds were a particular target of plume hunting. Bird feathers were used in women's hats in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Some frogs such as Bokermannohyla alvarengai, which basks in sunlight, lighten <b>their</b> <b>skin</b> colour when hot (and darkens when cold), making <b>their</b> <b>skin</b> reflect {{more heat}} and so avoid overheating.|$|R

5|$|A {{desert is}} not the kind of habitat that favours the {{presence}} of amphibians, with their requirement for water to keep <b>their</b> <b>skins</b> moist and for the development of their young. Nevertheless, some frogs live in deserts, creating moist habitats underground and hibernating while conditions are adverse. Couch's spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus couchii) emerges from its burrow when a downpour occurs and lays its eggs in the transient pools that form; the tadpoles develop with great rapidity, sometimes in as little as nine days, undergo metamorphosis, and feed voraciously before digging a burrow of their own.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians {{might seem}} {{unlikely}} desert-dwellers, {{because of their}} need to keep <b>their</b> <b>skins</b> moist and their dependence on water for reproductive purposes. In fact, the few species that are found in this habitat have made some remarkable adaptations. Most of them are fossorial, spending the hot dry months aestivating in deep burrows. While there they shed <b>their</b> <b>skins</b> {{a number of times}} and retain the remnants around them as a waterproof cocoon to retain moisture. In the Sonoran Desert, Couch's spadefoot toad spends most of the year dormant in its burrow. Heavy rain is the trigger for emergence and the first male to find a suitable pool calls to attract others. Eggs are laid and the tadpoles grow rapidly as they must reach metamorphosis before the water evaporates. As the desert dries out, the adult toads rebury themselves. The juveniles stay on the surface for a while, feeding and growing, but soon dig themselves burrows. Few make it to adulthood. The water holding frog in Australia has a similar life cycle and may aestivate for as long as five years if no rain falls. The Desert rain frog of Namibia is nocturnal and survives because of the damp sea fogs that roll in from the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|As it {{was easy}} to find and kill, the quagga was hunted by early Dutch {{settlers}} and later by Afrikaners to provide meat or for <b>their</b> <b>skins.</b> The skins were traded or used locally. The quagga was probably vulnerable to extinction due to its limited distribution, and it may have competed with domestic livestock for forage. The quagga had disappeared from much of its range by the 1850s. The last population in the wild, in the Orange Free State, was extirpated in the late 1870s. The last known wild individual died in 1878.|$|E

50|$|Because of the {{toughness}} and looseness of <b>their</b> <b>skin,</b> {{honey badgers}} {{are very difficult}} to kill with dogs. <b>Their</b> <b>skin</b> is hard to penetrate, and its looseness allows them to twist and turn on their attackers when held. The only safe grip on a honey badger is {{on the back of the}} neck. The skin is also tough enough to resist several machete blows. The only sure way of killing them quickly is through a blow to the skull with a club or a shot to the head with a gun, as <b>their</b> <b>skin</b> is almost impervious to arrows and spears.|$|R

5|$|On May 11, 1769, Boone began {{a two-year}} hunting {{expedition}} in Kentucky. On December 22, 1769, a fellow hunter and he were captured by {{a party of}} Shawnees, who confiscated all of <b>their</b> <b>skins</b> {{and told them to}} leave and never return. The Shawnees had not signed the Stanwix treaty, and since they regarded Kentucky as their hunting ground, they considered white hunters there to be poachers. Boone, however, continued hunting and exploring Kentucky until his return to North Carolina in 1771, and returned to hunt there again in the autumn of 1772.|$|E
5|$|The American {{alligator}} {{is listed}} as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Historically, hunting had decimated their population, and the American alligator was listed as an endangered species by the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Subsequent conservation efforts have allowed their numbers to increase and the species {{was removed from the}} list in 1987. American alligators are now harvested for <b>their</b> <b>skins</b> and meat. The species is the official state reptile of three states: Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|Many {{crocodilians}} are {{hunted for}} <b>their</b> <b>skins,</b> {{but this is}} not the case with the Cuvier's dwarf caiman. This may be because the ventral skin in this species is too heavily armoured to make it easy to tan. Some individuals are killed by indigenous peoples for food and others, particularly in Guyana, are collected for the pet trade; but there is no evidence that populations are dwindling as a result. There are some threats to this species from habitat destruction, including the mining of gold, but these are not thought to be of great significance. The estimated total population is over one million individuals.|$|E

5|$|As they {{evolved from}} lunged fish, {{amphibians}} {{had to make}} certain adaptations for living on land, including {{the need to develop}} new means of locomotion. In the water, the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward, but on land, quite different mechanisms were required. Their vertebral columns, limbs, limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding. Terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air. They needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature. They developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment. <b>Their</b> <b>skins</b> were exposed to harmful ultraviolet rays that had previously been absorbed by the water. The skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss.|$|E
5|$|Native Americans {{valued the}} great auk {{as a food}} source during the winter and as an {{important}} cultural symbol. Images of the great auk {{have been found in}} bone necklaces. A person buried at the Maritime Archaic site at Port au Choix, Newfoundland, dating to about 2000 BC, was found surrounded by more than 200 great auk beaks, which are believed to have been part of a suit made from <b>their</b> <b>skins,</b> with the heads left attached as decoration. Nearly half of the bird bones found in graves at this site were of the great auk, suggesting that it had great cultural significance for the Maritime Archaic people. The extinct Beothuks of Newfoundland made pudding out of the eggs of the great auk. The Dorset Eskimos also hunted it. The Saqqaq in Greenland overhunted the species, causing a local reduction in range.|$|E
5|$|An early trader, Emilian Basov, traded at Bering Island in 1743, {{collecting}} a {{large number}} of sea otter, fur seal, and blue Arctic fox furs. Basov made four trips to Bering Island and nearby Medny Island and made a fortune, inspiring many other traders. From 1743 to the founding of the Russian-American Company in 1799, over 100 private fur-trading and hunting voyages sailed from Kamchatka to North America. In total, these voyages garnered over eight million silver rubles. During {{the early part of this}} era, the ships would typically stop at the Commander Islands to slaughter and preserve the meat of Steller's sea cows, a defenseless sea mammal whose range was limited to those islands. They were hunted not only for food, but also for <b>their</b> <b>skins,</b> used to make boats, and their subcutaneous fat, used for oil lamps. By 1768, Steller's sea cow was extinct. As furs were depleted on nearby islands, Russian traders sailed farther east along the Aleutian chain. By the 1760s, they were regularly sailing to Kodiak Island. Notable Russian traders in the early years of the trade include Nikifor Trapeznikov (who financed and participated in 10 voyages between 1743 and 1768), Maksimovich Solov'ev, Stepan Glotov, and Grigory Shelikhov.|$|E

5|$|Most {{species of}} the Hydrophiinae are able to respire through the top of <b>their</b> <b>skin.</b> This is unusual for reptiles, because <b>their</b> <b>skin</b> is thick and scaly, but {{experiments}} with the black-and-yellow sea snake, Pelamis platura (a pelagic species), have shown this species can satisfy about 25% of its oxygen requirements in this manner, which allows for prolonged dives.|$|R
50|$|Thorny dragons collect {{moisture}} in the dry desert via nighttime condensation of dew that forms on <b>their</b> <b>skin</b> and is channeled to their mouths in hygroscopic grooves between the spines of <b>their</b> <b>skin.</b> Water also collects in these grooves when it rains. Capillary action allows the lizard to suck in water from all over its body.|$|R
5|$|The {{first factor}} in {{the decline of the}} kakapo was the arrival of humans. Māori {{folklore}} suggests that the kakapo was found throughout the country when the Polynesians first arrived in Aotearoa 700 years ago. Subfossil and midden deposits show that the bird was present throughout the North Island, South Island and Stewart Island/Rakiura before and during early Māori times. Māori hunted the kakapo for food and for <b>their</b> <b>skins</b> and feathers, which were made into cloaks. They used the dried heads as ear ornaments. Due to its flightlessness, strong scent and habit of freezing when threatened, the kakapo was easy prey for the Māori and their dogs. Its eggs and chicks were also preyed upon by the Polynesian rat or kiore, which the Māori brought to New Zealand. Furthermore, the deliberate clearing of vegetation by Māori reduced the habitable range for kakapo. Although the kakapo was extinct {{in many parts of the}} islands by the time Europeans arrived, including the Tararua and Aorangi Ranges, it was still present in the central part of the North Island and forested parts of the South Island.|$|E
5|$|The {{technicians}} {{start the}} washing process immediately, since delay can cause fermentation of the sugary coating surrounding the bean and ruination {{of the coffee}} flavour. The beans are first thrown into a deep tank. The best cherries sink {{to the bottom and}} pass through a machine that removes their skin. The technicians remove any floating cherries and process them {{in the same way as}} the others for the cooperative to sell on the domestic market for less than specialty-coffee price. The beans are fed through one of the cooperative's three de-skinning and selection machines to remove <b>their</b> <b>skins</b> and most of the sugary coating before running the individual beans through a vibrating colander. The colander separates the very highest quality Grade A beans from those labeled Grade B; the two grades are sent separately down the hill in a water chute with a 1 percent gradient. This process allows for further separation of beans based on quality, with around 15 tanks available at the bottom for capture of the different types. The beans are kept submerged, two days for the best and 15–20 hours for the lesser beans, which causes a small amount of fermentation to convert the remainder of the sugar without significantly impairing the flavour.|$|E
5|$|When the lophophore is extended, cilia (little hairs) on {{the sides}} of the tentacles draw water down between the tentacles and out at the base of the lophophore. Shorter cilia on the inner sides of the tentacles flick food {{particles}} into a groove in a circle under and just inside the tentacles, and cilia in the groove push the particles into the mouth. Phoronids direct their lophophores into the water current, and quickly reorient to maximize the food-catching area when currents change. Their diet includes algae, diatoms, flagellates, peridinians, small invertebrate larvae, and detritus. Unwanted material can be excluded by closing the epistome (lid above the mouth) or be rejected by the tentacles, whose cilia can switch into reverse. The gut uses cilia and muscles to move food towards the stomach and secretes enzymes that digest some of the food, but the stomach digests the majority of the food. Phoronids also absorb amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) through <b>their</b> <b>skins,</b> mainly in summer. Solid wastes are moved up the intestine and out through the anus, which is outside and slightly below the lophophore.|$|E

25|$|The initial {{winemaking}} {{steps of}} Madeira start out {{like most other}} wines: grapes are harvested, crushed, pressed, and then fermented in either stainless steel or oak casks. The grape varieties destined for sweeter wines – Bual and Malvasia – are often fermented on <b>their</b> <b>skins</b> to leach more phenols from the grapes to balance {{the sweetness of the}} wine. The more dry wines – made from Sercial, Verdelho, and Negra Mole – are separated from <b>their</b> <b>skins</b> prior to fermentation.
