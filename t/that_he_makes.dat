He does so with so much interest <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> major life decisions by subconsciously taking on the behaviours of characters from these films.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the reason}} people rarely talk about his {{formidable}} attributes as a singer is <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood. Ease in any art {{is the result of}} mastery over the details of the craft. You get them together {{to the point where you}} can forget about how you do things and concentrate on what you are doing. Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it — but happily so.|$|E

25|$|The last {{objection}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> {{draws on}} the widely discussed problem of evil. He argues that all the daily unnecessary suffering that goes on everywhere within the world is yet another factor that pulls away from the idea that God is an 'omnipotent' 'benevolent' being.|$|E
25|$|Plautus {{was known}} {{for the use of}} Greek style in his plays, as part of the {{tradition}} of the variation on a theme. This has been a point of contention among modern scholars. One argument states that Plautus writes with originality and creativity—the other, that Plautus is a copycat of Greek New Comedy and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> no original contribution to playwriting.|$|E

25|$|Free-to-play {{games are}} free to install and play, but once the player enters the game, the player is able to {{purchase}} content such as items, maps, and expanded customization options. Some games, such as id Software's Quake Live also use in-game advertising to provide income for free-to-play games. In addition to making in-game items available for purchase, EA integrates in-game advertising into its games. In August 2007, EA completed a deal with Massive Incorporated, which lets Massive update and change in-game advertising in real-time within EA games. Independent game developer Edmund McMillen, has claimed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> most of his money from sponsors by placing advertisements into {{the introduction of a}} game and the game's title screen.|$|E
25|$|Shakespeare satirizes the {{hyperbole}} of the allusions used {{by conventional}} poets, which {{even by the}} Elizabethan era, had become cliché, predictable, and uninspiring. This sonnet compares the poet's mistress {{to a number of}} natural beauties; each time making a point of his mistress' obvious inadequacy in such comparisons; she cannot hope {{to stand up to the}} beauties of the natural world. The first two quatrains compare the speaker's mistress to aspects of nature, such as snow or coral; each comparison ending unflatteringly for the mistress. In the final couplet, the speaker proclaims his love for his mistress by declaring <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> no false comparisons, the implication being that other poets do precisely that. Shakespeare's sonnet aims to do the opposite, by indicating that his mistress is the ideal object of his affections because of her genuine qualities, and that she is more worthy of his love than the paramours of other poets who are more fanciful.|$|E

25|$|The {{video is}} set in a {{colorful}} city and has a futuristic theme to it. The storyline of the video begins with Jordan dropping off her boyfriend at a bus stop, as they appear to be breaking up. She is seen sitting in the backseat of her orange AMC Pacer, and starts to sing the song's first verse, just as the wind begins to pick up, sliding her car and the bus stop, where her boyfriend is at, in opposite directions. Throughout the video, the city moves in motion. It is intercut with other scenes, including Jordan dancing with four other back-up dancers at a swimming pool, a man reading a newspaper while holding a Dalmatian dog by its leash, and also a woman with a few shopping bags. During the car scenes, Jordan sees flashbacks of her boyfriend in the car's rear-view mirror. She later realises <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> her happy and moves to the driver's seat, to stop the car. Jordan then reverses the car, sending her back to the bus stop.|$|E
25|$|The film {{begins in}} a Los Angeles diner where a {{waitress}} named Slim (Jennifer Lopez) works with her best friend, Ginny (Juliette Lewis). She receives unwelcome romantic advances from Robbie, a customer who teases {{her about her}} name. Another man in the diner, Mitch Hiller (Billy Campbell), reveals that the customer had made a bet {{that he would be}} able to convince Slim to sleep with him. Soon after, Slim falls in love with and marries Mitch, and they have a child named Gracie (Tessa Allen). Years later, Slim finds out Mitch has been cheating on her with a French woman named Darcelle. She confronts him and he admits it, but also insisting Darcelle means nothing to him. Slim becomes angry and threatens to leave, which enrages Mitch, who becomes violent, slapping and punching her in the face. He gives her a warning, saying <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> the money and gets to do whatever he likes, implying he wants an open marriage. Mitch refuses to stop his affair unless she wants to fight him. The next day, Slim confides in Mitch's mother (Janet Carroll); she asks Slim what she did to make Mitch angry, implying he has a history of physical abuse. Ginny advises Slim to leave and imprison Mitch, but Slim does not want to hurt Gracie. She then goes to pick up Gracie from school, only to discover Mitch had already picked her up. Panicked that Mitch might have left town with her, she calls Mitch, who tells her that he took Gracie to the zoo.|$|E

500|$|Eliot's Simeon appears {{similar to}} Dante's {{depiction}} of Virgil in the Divine Comedy, as [...] "the seer who can see only so far; the precursor who cannot {{enter the world}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> possible". Virgil, in the Divine Comedy, leads Dante through Hell (Inferno) and Purgatory (Purgatorio), but cannot guide him into Paradise (Paradiso). In this context, Virgil {{was a symbol of}} non-Christian philosophy and humanities could not help Dante any further in his approach to God. [...] In Eliot's depiction, Simeon will never know the Christian culture he prophesizes, sensing [...] "the birth-pangs of a world that he will never occupy".|$|E

A few years later there was a public scandal when {{it was discovered that}} Hawkins had inserted fake bones to make some ichthyosaur skeletons seem more complete, and later sold them to the government for the British Museum's collection without the appraisers knowing about the additions.|$|E
500|$|Judah Friedlander, who portrays Frank Rossitano in 30 Rock, {{is known}} for his {{trademark}} trucker hats which he wears {{in and out of the}} Frank character. The hats normally have short words or phrases glued onto them. Friedlander has stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> the hats himself. He has also said that [...] "some are in-jokes, and some are just flat out jokes." [...] The idea came from Friedlander's stand-up persona in which his hats are all printed with [...] "world champion" [...] in different languages in different appearances.

500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the episode, several physicians played a game of baseball to cheer up. Rater called it [...] "her favorite scene", explaining: [...] "I loved the scene where Owen, Derek and Mark take Cristina, Meredith and Lexie to the baseball field. This {{is one of the first}} times Owen has seen Cristina's intensity. And I love <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> her leave the hospital, focus on something else. That's why he's so good for her. The scene was actually inspired by Shonda saying, let's do a scene where they're all playing baseball. But when I finally saw it, it makes me want to write more scenes like that, with our doctors outside of the hospital, little glimpses of them in real life." ...|$|E

500|$|Tom Welling {{feels that}} the deal Jonathan made with Jor-El at the {{beginning}} of season three made Jonathan realize that he will not always be around to protect Clark. Welling believes that it is the repercussions of that deal that allow Jonathan to give Clark more freedom in the choices <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> during season three. Jonathan realizes that he must help Clark find the confidence in his ability to survive on his own, so that he can leave home one day. One scene that Schneider specifically remembers {{was at the end of}} season three's [...] "Forsaken". Here, Jonathan admits to not trusting his own instincts anymore and allowing Clark to rely on his. This [...] "admission of fallibility", but faith in his son's ability to make the right choices, is what Schneider sees as the growing of the family dynamic.|$|E
