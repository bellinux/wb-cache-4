On first or second terrace in basin, gravel layer is most chose as the bearing stratum <b>for</b> <b>pile</b> <b>foundation</b> of high-rise buildings. Static driven piles are commonly used in Nanning, because they have advantages of fast construction, high bearing capacity and noiseless despite costly. In this paper, the actual test data of a 32 -stories apartment building of a college in Nanning has been consider- ed in detail.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to examine the use of grouting methods <b>for</b> <b>pile</b> <b>foundation</b> improvement, a generic term that is used here to define both foundation renovation (increasing the bearing capacity of a <b>pile</b> <b>foundation</b> that has insufficient bearing capacity) and foundation protection (safeguarding the <b>piles</b> of the <b>foundation</b> against possible damage resulting from underground construction activities in the vicinity). A full-scale test, of which the general set-up and consistency check are outlined in the thesis, examining the feasibility of foundation improvement by means of grouting techniques was conducted in Amsterdam. The main part of the thesis focuses on permeation grouting, jet grouting and compaction grouting. For each method, first some more general aspects like history, grouting equipment, grouting parameters and fields of application are outlined. Subsequently existing theories used in modelling the grouting process are examined and compared. The test results are discussed. By using the pile displacements, soil stresses, pore pressures and pile bearing capacity measured in the test, it was possible to examine the influence of grouting methods on <b>pile</b> <b>foundations.</b> The use of and suitability of geophysical verification methods for grouting, which were necessary to determine the shape and position of grouted elements, were also considered. To determine how grouting methods can best be applied for foundation renovation purposes, the cost of grouting methods and the hindrance that they cause have been compared with those of conventional foundation renovation methods. The construction cost of grouting can be up to about 50 % lower than that of conventional methods of underpinning a structure. Taking cost, hindrance and the test results into consideration, it can be concluded that permeation grouting and compaction grouting are economic and effective alternatives to conventional underpinning methods <b>for</b> renovating <b>pile</b> <b>foundations.</b> The methods may also be used <b>for</b> <b>pile</b> <b>foundation</b> protection. Jet grouting is only suitable for use in the renovation of end bearing piles when the structure is strong and stiff enough to redistribute the loads from the grouted pile.

40|$|ABSTRACT Civil Engineering is {{the major}} {{instrument}} of anthropocentric development over centuries through ever expanding infrastructure, cities and facilities. Civil engineering processes are both resource and fuel intensive. The building industry alone, during the construction stage, uses about 30 - 40 % of the total resources used in the industrialized countries. There is a growing consensus that delivering a sustainable built environment starts with incorporating sustainability thoughts at the planning and design stages of a project. Geotechnical engineering is most resource intensive although this intensive consumption of energy goes unnoticed {{mainly because of the}} indirect nature of the energy used in the form of materials and natural resources (e. g., concrete, steel and land use). Hence, geotechnical engineering warrants a sustainability study to balance the environmental effectiveness, technological feasibility and economic profitability in any civil engineering project. In this thesis, a quantitative, multicriteria based sustainability indicator <b>for</b> <b>pile</b> <b>foundations</b> is developed that will aid the design and decision making processes of <b>pile</b> <b>foundation</b> projects. Specifically two types of <b>pile</b> <b>foundations,</b> namely, the driven concrete pile and the drilled shaft, are considered. The impacts these two types of piles create on the environment are investigated from the viewpoints of both resource consumption and process emissions. A life cycle analysis (LCA) is performed to develop sustainability metrics <b>for</b> <b>pile</b> <b>foundations</b> considering resource use, process emissions and waste generation. Other environmental impacts like change in land use pattern, noise pollution, compaction and vibration have been qualitatively considered in the study. Resources utilized in the process are accounted for by the thermodynamics-based accounting methods of exergy, emergy, and embodied energy. An economic cost benefit analysis is performed to ensure that the framework is not skewed towards environmental sustainability alone. The performance of the individual pile types in the categories of resource use, environmental impact and cost benefit analysis is quantified as impact scores in the respective categories. The impact scores are then incorporated into a multicriteria analysis with chosen weights for each category and an overall score is obtained. Thus, a new holistic approach to incorporate sustainability in geotechnical design and planning is introduced in this thesis...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} a {{geotechnical}} work should satisfy both the ultimate limit state (ULS) and serviceability limit state (SLS) requirements. The limit state design approach addresses various performance requirements and aims to accommodate uncertainties in design. Presently, most limit state design codes use reliability principles for ultimate limit states. However, serviceability limit states are still considered using the conventional deterministic approach. Many geotechnical works such as building foundations are more often governed by serviceability requirements rather than by ultimate limit requirements. Therefore, the deterministic displacement criterion may not be sufficient and a reliability-based displacement criterion is needed to enhance these design codes. <b>Pile</b> <b>foundations</b> are widely used in practice for supporting superstructures. A number of methods are available for estimating settlement of single piles and pile groups. Due {{to the presence of}} uncertainties, there may be errors with the estimations. To develop reliability-based serviceability criteria <b>for</b> <b>pile</b> <b>foundation</b> design, it is necessary to characterize the performance of commonly used settlement prediction models <b>for</b> single <b>piles</b> and pile groups. In this thesis, performance data of 64 cases of single piles and 59 cases of pile groups from field static loading tests are collected for study. These data are compiled into two databases, Database A <b>for</b> single <b>piles</b> and Database B <b>for</b> <b>pile</b> groups, <b>for</b> calibrating settlement analysis models <b>for</b> single <b>piles</b> and pile groups. Driven <b>pile</b> <b>foundations</b> in sandy soils are the main focus of study; other types of <b>pile</b> <b>foundations</b> are {{beyond the scope of this}} thesis.

To obtain the compliances <b>for</b> the <b>pile</b> <b>foundations,</b> the pile-soil interaction problem is solved by the fictitious pile method first. Using the transfer matrix method and the obtained compliances <b>for</b> the <b>pile</b> <b>foundations,</b> the impedances <b>for</b> the piers are obtained. Based on the Bloch theorem and the transfer matrix method, the nonlinear polynomial eigenvalue equation for the periodic viaduct is derived using the impedance of the piers. Utilizing the obtained nonlinear eigenvalue equation, the approximate linear eigenvalue equation for the periodic viaduct is obtained and numerical results for the energy bands of the periodic viaduct are presented. Numerical results of this paper show that for the out-of-plane vibration of the periodic viaduct, there are three kinds of lattice waves propagating in the periodic viaduct. Moreover, in a low frequency range, all three lattice waves are evanescent, which will lead to the localization of lattice waves in the periodic viaduct. No Full Tex...|$|R
