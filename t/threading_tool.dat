Loosening is caused between the flanks {{of the bolt}} and nut threads. This lateral movement releases the locking friction that holds the joint together. Spiralock is a uniquely designed female thread form which used with male fasteners of standard thread form provides a self locking action that prevents the lateral movement, and thus makes the threaded joint highly resistant {{to the effects of}} vibration. Additionally, a thread contract runs {{the entire length of the}} nut, offering greater stress resistance than earlier fasteners...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Multithreading {{has been}} shown to be {{powerful}} approaches for boosting a system performance by taking advantage of parallelism in applications. Producer / Consumer, Web services, Banking and Image compression are good examples of applications that benefit from threading. Performance is increased because multiple threads running on multiple cores can process many requests simultaneously. This paper provides a summary of optimizing a serial designed application to multithreaded applications for Pentium dual core. The exercise uses the Java language as an example. This paper also discusses about the <b>threading</b> <b>tool</b> which is capable of converting a non threaded program into a threaded program to convert it into an efficient multithreaded application. It is observed that multithreading leads to tune the application performance considerably. To realize the advantages of model-driven development in designing parallel applications, a survey is conducted and it is observed that model driven development combined with multithreading can achieve better benefits...|$|E

Certain especially significant design variables such as the offset, the length of the contact thread and the shank length above the threaded hole, are selected to be closely examined. A comparison of the influence on the pre-tension force between threaded holes made with a worn, versus new, <b>threading</b> <b>tool</b> is also involved in the experiment. The study is limited to handling the screw sizes M 2, 5 and M 3, 5. The results show that a regression model, with good approximation, can be fitted to the measured values.

40|$|A {{total of}} 69 {{employees}} in various job positions working in cubicles in an open-office space plan, {{of a large}} organization, completed a questionnaire investigating the impact of microenvironmental space on communication and job satisfaction. Data was analyzed using quantitative research methods. The results showed that a distinct lack of conversational privacy existed in this office. Also, when the level of noise decreased, the perceived level of privacy and job satisfaction increased.

In conclusion, {{the results of this}} study suggested two options for the decreased communication and job satisfaction: converting some space in the midst of all the cubicles into a gathering room to solve the problems such as lack of conversational privacy, distractions, and colleagues dropping in for a chat, or telecommuting.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{model of}} the <b>threading</b> <b>tool</b> hardening on high-speed plasma heating has been presented {{as well as the}} mathematical description of the heating process. The reproduction of the model by means of computer simulation, based {{on the use of the}} finite elements method, including structural and physical parameters of the tool has been offered. The heat distribution in the heat-affected zone, and the relationship that makes it possible to determine the temperature at any point of the body, bringing the simulation results closer to the actual physical characteristics of the process have been shown. The analysis conducted in this article shows the prospects of using surface hardening methods to improve performance of thread-cutting tools. However, due to the complex profile of the working surface of the tools, application of any hardening method involves difficulties. On the strength of the above-said, with due regard to the established requirements for geometrical parameters of the thread-cutting tools and their loading conditions, as well as well-known recommendations for other types of tools, the technological processes for plasma processing of various types of thread-cutting tools have been developed. In developing the technology of plasma modification it is very important to select the optimum mode of heating, which ensures the formation of the modified zones of required size. This problem is solved by means of the analysis of thermal fields in the tool during plasma heating. The experience of using plasma hardening shows that the thermal cycle of heating and cooling materials can be controlled by varying such parameters as arc current and the speed of the plasma torch movement at a constant optimum level of the other parameters (plasma gas flow and the cooling water, the distance of the nozzle exit to the surface being machined...|$|E
