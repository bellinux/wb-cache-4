40|$|Retroelement RNAs {{serve as}} {{templates}} for both translation and reverse transcription into extrachromosomal DNA. DNA copies may be {{inserted into the}} host genome to multiply element sequences. This transpositional activity of retroelements is usually restricted to specific conditions, particularly to conditions that impose stress on the host organism. In this work, we examined how the mRNA initiation point, and features of primary and secondary structure, of tobacco retrotransposon Tto 1 RNA influence its transpositional activity. We found that the most abundant Tto 1 RNA is not a substrate for reverse transcription. It is poorly translated, and its 5 ′-end does not contain a region of redundancy with the most prominent 3 ′-end. In contrast, expression of an mRNA with the 5 ′-end extended by 28 nucleotides allows translation and gives rise to transposition events in the heterologous host, Arabidopsis thaliana. In addition, the presence of extended hairpins and of two short open reading frames in the 5 ′-leader sequence of Tto 1 mRNA suggests that <b>translation</b> does <b>not</b> <b>involve</b> ribosome scanning from the mRNA 5 ′-end to the translation initiation site...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the role that {{translation}} plays as cultural mediator, as it already widely accepted that <b>translation</b> <b>involves</b> <b>not</b> just two languages, but two cultures, two worlds that are brought into close contact with each other. Obviously, between the two cultures, the two worlds that translation compares and contrasts there are both similarities and dissimilarities. What is of interest to us is the way in which dissimilarities should be approached in the process of translation, whether they should be domesticated or foreignized as Venuti put it, whether the reader should be brought closer to the text or the text closer to the reader...|$|R

The establishment of MTI in China has not solved this problem. This article attempts to identify effective teaching strategies by conducting an empirical study with Interpretive Theory. Index Terms—interpreting, interpretive theory, teaching strategies I. RESEARCH BACKGROUND The Interpretive Theory was first proposed by Seleskovitch and Lederer, professors of ESIT. The core is deverbalization, which holds that interpreting {{is not just a}} change from source language to target language. It is a kind of reformulation on the basis of understanding. Therefore, the interpreting process can be divided into three stages: understanding of the source language, deverbalization and re-expression on the basis of understanding. And sense unit has informed the three stages. Setton has done some research on the interpreting process from the perspective of cognition and pragmatics. He (1999) holds that interpreting requires three capacities: expressiveness, language processing and cognition, the third of which could be reckoned as deverbalization. Bassnet (2002) points out that <b>translation</b> <b>involves</b> <b>not</b> only substitution of words and grammar from the cultural context of language. Therefore, equivalence in <b>translation</b> is <b>not</b> about seeking sameness, and it's very dangerous to impose the value system of the source language onto the target language. Ba...|$|R
40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. The vernacularization of {{international}} policy involves a highly complicated process {{of legal and}} cultural translation. Ethnographic research on the role translation played in the UNESCO World Heritage Site nomination of Catholic churches in Japan's Nagasaki prefecture illuminates the way existing social hierarchies struggle to maintain themselves in the current tide of globalization. Framed as a universal legal regime with specific policy requirements of enhanced democratic, gender balanced political participation, the Convention nevertheless became a tool for intermediary actors {{in their attempts to}} maintain and even strengthen local hierarchies of power. Focusing on the communicative aspects of law in daily practice, particularly the constant interpretation and reinterpretation needed to give contextual, metapragmatic meaning to the words and phrases of the law, reveals layers of multilingual and multi-administrative system vagueness that presents politically informed translation opportunities for chains of actors from national local levels. Legal <b>translation</b> <b>involves</b> <b>not</b> only exuberances and deficiencies between languages but also between regimes of power represented by systems of administrative law and politics...|$|R
40|$|Global image {{orientation}} techniques aim at estimating camera rotations {{and positions}} {{for a whole}} set of images simultaneously. One of the main arguments for these procedures is an improved robustness against drifting of camera stations in comparison to more classical sequential approaches. Usually, the process consists of computation of absolute rotations and, in a second step, absolute positions for the cameras. Either the first or both steps rely on the network of transformations arising from relative orientations between cameras. Therefore, the quality of the obtained absolute results is influenced by tensions in the network. These may e. g. be induced by insufficient knowledge of the intrinsic camera parameters. Another reason can be found in local weaknesses of image connectivity. We apply a hierarchical approach with intermediate bundle adjustment to reduce these effects. We adopt efficient global techniques which register image triplets based on fixed absolute camera rotations and scaled relative camera <b>translations</b> but do <b>not</b> <b>involve</b> scene structure elements in the fusion step. Our variant employs submodels of arbitrary size, orientation and scale, by computing relative rotations and scales between - and subsequently absolute rotations and scales for - submodels and is applied hierarchically. Furthermore we substitute classical bundle adjustment by a structureless approach based on epipolar geometry and augmented with a scale consistency constraint...|$|R

40|$|Translation {{involves}} {{integration of}} {{a multitude of}} disciplines and perspectives from which to compare two or more cultures. When translation is extended to film dialogue, in subtitling, the target language viewer unfamiliar with the source language must rely upon the subtitles to access the film's dialogue provided within {{the space of the}} verbal exchange, and often the subtitles offer an altered version of the dialogue, particularly given the time and space constraints of the medium. Subtitling, a unique form of <b>translation,</b> <b>not</b> only <b>involves</b> interlingual transfer but also intersemiotic transfer from a spoken dialogue to a written text. This work examines the linguistic treatment of three marginalized groups [...] homosexuals, women, and foreigners [...] as expressed in subtitles. In many instances, translation of certain elements in the films, such as forms of address and general referential language, change the meaning for the TL viewer. Cultural references present in the oral dialogue often get omitted or modified in the subtitles, altering the TL viewer's perception of the narrative and characters. These differently rendered translations have connotative qualities that are often differ significantly from the oral dialogue. In many cases, epithets and grammatically gendered language in the SL dialogue get diluted or omitted in the TL subtitles; likewise, power relationships expressed through use of forms of address, such as titles or tutoiement and vouvoiement, cannot be adequately conveyed, and the TL viewer is excluded from this nuanced form of discourse. Cultural references providing supplemental information, including non-dialogic text, are not always rendered in the subtitles, depriving the TL viewer of additional layers of meaning. In dual-language films featuring foreigners, nuances expressed by code switching and code mixing cannot be completely represented in the subtitles. Close analysis of subtitles {{within the framework of the}} sociolinguistic and cultural interpretations of the resultant TL dialogue reveals a great deal about the transmission and reception of cultural ideas and has not been addressed to this extent from this perspective. It is to be hoped that this study will inspire interest in further explorations of this nature and contribute to the ever-growing corpus of research in subtitling studies...|$|R
40|$|What is a translation? Is it {{possible}} to translate everything? What is the translator’s job? Different languages may have different ways of expressing specific concepts or words, especially in cases where there are culture-bound terms. Furthermore, when translators {{face the challenge of}} dealing with sensitive texts, e. g. feminist, religious, political or even sexually-explicit texts, they might have to employ different strategies and think of several approaches to render the source text (ST) in the most acceptable way for the target audience. This paper focuses on the translators’ role as first readers and mediators of the original ST in order to detect any form of visibility in their <b>translations.</b> <b>Translation</b> does <b>not</b> only <b>involve</b> a cross-cultural transfer but also an ideological transfer based upon the translator’s own interpretation of the ST as well as on his or her socio-cultural background expectations and conventions. The translation process starts with a careful reading of the ST since reading contributes to the creation of meaning and, just like translations, it implies a continuous process of decision-making. Translators’ mediation and (in) visibility {{play an important role in}} the translation process their choices and strategies legitimate a linguistic analysis and, more precisely, a contrastive linguistic analysis.

40|$|Frequent co-infection of {{hepatitis}} B virus genotype G with genotype A suggests it might require genotype A for replication or transmission. In this regard, genotype G {{is unique in}} having a 12 -amino acid extension in the core protein due to a 36 -nucleotide insertion near the core gene translation initiation codon. The insertion alters base pairing in the lower stem of the pregenome encapsidation signal that harbors core gene initiator, and thus {{has the potential to}} affect both core protein translation and pregenomic RNA encapsidation. Genotype G is also unusual for possessing two nonsense mutations in the precore region, which together with the core gene encodes a secreted nonstructural protein called hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). We found that genotype G clones were indeed incapable of HBeAg expression, but were competent in RNA transcription, genome replication, and virion secretion. Interestingly, the 36 -nucleotide insertion markedly increased core protein, which was achieved at the level of protein <b>translation</b> but did <b>not</b> <b>involve</b> alteration in the mRNA level. Consequently, the variant core protein was readily detectable in patient blood. The 12 -amino acid insertion also enhanced genome maturity of secreted virus particles, possibly through less efficient envelopment of core particles. Co-transfection of genotypes G and A did not lead to mutual interference of genome replication or virion secretion. Considering that HBeAg is an immunotolerogen required for the establishment of persistent infection, its lack of expression rather than a replication defect could be the primary determinant for the rare occurrence of genotype G monoinfection...|$|R
