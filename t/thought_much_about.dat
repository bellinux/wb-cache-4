25|$|Nyong'o is {{involved}} in the organization Mother Health International, which is dedicated to providing relief to women and children in Uganda by creating locally engaged birthing centers. She said she’d never <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> birthing practices until her sister introduced her to MHI executive director Rachel Zaslow. Nyong'o felt bringing attention to such important but overlooked issues is a mandate for her as an artist. She was honored for her work at 2016 Variety's Power of Women.|$|E
500|$|When Newton {{received}} his MA {{and became a}} Fellow of the [...] "College of the Holy and Undivided Trinity" [...] in 1667, he made the commitment that [...] "I will either set Theology {{as the object of}} my studies and will take holy orders when the time prescribed by these statutes [...] arrives, or I will resign from the college." [...] Up till this point he had not <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> religion and had twice signed his agreement to the thirty-nine articles, the basis of Church of England doctrine.|$|E
500|$|Cunningham sees A Handful of Dust as a {{forerunner of}} Waugh's later, avowedly Catholic novels. In keeping with Waugh's dismissive {{attitude}} to the Church of England, Anglicanism is shown as a farce (Mr Tendril the vicar's sermons), or a nullity (Tony's admission {{that he had}} never really <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> God). Instead, Christianity is evoked by presenting the awfulness of life without it; according to the writer and critic Frank Kermode, [...] "he callousness of incident and the coldness of tone work by suggesting the positive and rational declaration of the Faith". The reader, Stannard says, [...] "is never allowed to forget man's primal bestiality... God is the key that has been thrown away in this purely secular world". John Raymond in the New Statesman refers to Waugh's [...] "unique type of moral vision", and calls the novel a [...] "powerful twentieth century sermon on the breakdown of a Christian marriage".|$|E

6000|$|... "I never <b>thought</b> so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> {{her good}} looks," [...] he said. They were talking of the singer, {{the charms of}} whose voice had carried Lord Silverbridge away.|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't do it. I {{should fall}} down dead first. I have <b>thought</b> so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it,--for your sake; and have tried it with myself. I couldn't do it." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "One {{afternoon}} while I {{was working}} in the studio with Talking Heads, the roadie from Foreigner, working in an adjacent studio, came in and asked whether anyone wanted to buy some video equipment. I'd never really <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> video, and found most 'video art' completely unmemorable, but the prospect of actually owning a video camera was at that time quite exotic." ...|$|E
60|$|GINGER Was a {{time when}} I didn't. I used to be all for--you know-- larking about. I never <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> anything.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Minnie"--such was {{his name}} of endearment for her--"I can't say I have <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it, and I don't suppose anybody else has either." ...|$|E
60|$|He sprang up, {{put on his}} shoes, {{and paced}} the churchyard. It seemed a great waste of {{educational}} advantages not to study the tower of this foreign church, but he <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> more <b>about</b> his aching shoulder-blades.|$|R
6000|$|... "Please don't {{be angry}} with Dodo; she does not see things. She <b>thought</b> so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the cottages, and she was rude to Sir James sometimes; but he is so kind, he never noticed it." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was not a}} great personality, {{because he}} <b>thought</b> so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> himself. And the case is {{stronger}} even than that. He was sometimes not even a great artist, because he <b>thought</b> so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> art. Any man with a vital knowledge of the human psychology {{ought to have the}} most profound suspicion of anybody who claims to be an artist, and talks a great deal about art. Art is a right and human thing, like walking or saying one's prayers; but the moment it begins to be talked about very solemnly, a man may be fairly certain that the thing has come into a congestion and a kind of difficulty.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never learned}} how to observe. Of course I know that some matches turn out well and some don't, but I never <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can hardly}} as yet have any very {{confirmed}} political opinion. You are still young, and I do not suppose {{that you have}} <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> politics." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I hadn't <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> that yet." [...] He felt guilty, and was profusely cordial to Lee Theresa Zapp, {{the factory}} forewoman, {{who had just}} thumped down-stairs.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{felt that}} you were in earnest, then I had to be in earnest too. And I <b>thought</b> so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it that I lay awake nearly all that night. Shall I tell you what I thought?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, nevertheless, {{she ought}} to {{know better than to}} speak disparagingly of me to my servants. She should have more respect for herself." [...] And the squire showed by the tone of his voice that he <b>thought</b> very <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is very true," [...] said he, [...] "but I have <b>thought</b> so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> them, and I {{have studied}} and {{consulted}} so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> them, that I think I have provided {{against all the}} dangers we have reason to expect. To me the whole business seems like very plain, straightforward sailing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I do not know," [...] {{said the}} {{somewhat}} startled Endymion; [...] "I have not <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it, and I {{have not yet}} reached a parliamentary age." ...|$|E
6000|$|Early on the {{following}} morning his father again sent for him. [...] "Mountjoy," [...] he said, [...] "I have <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it, and I have changed my mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And so do I," [...] {{said the}} judge, [...] "and have <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it since. A very clever fellow is Felix Graham. There {{can be no}} doubt of that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And oh," [...] exclaimed Cecily in delight, [...] "there's {{the china}} fruit basket with the apple on the handle. Doesn't it look real? I've <b>thought</b> so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it. Oh, mother, {{please let me}} hold it for a minute. I'll be as careful as careful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hardly know. I never <b>much</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> it. Something between both, I think. Brown--not fair, and--and {{not very}} dark." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Kennicott? Oh, she's all right, I guess." [...] Relief to Carol, below. [...] "She gimme a hunk o' cake, one time. But Ma says she's stuck-up as hell. Ma's {{always talking}} about her. Ma says if Mrs. Kennicott <b>thought</b> as <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the doc as she does about her clothes, the doc wouldn't look so peaked." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, that's so," [...] said Joe, [...] "but I hadn't <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it, you know. I'd a {{good deal}} rather be a pirate, now that I've tried it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Believe me," [...] she said, softly, [...] "I am {{very sorry}} to leave you, and {{am glad to}} have been of help to you, though you have never <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've never <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it," [...] said Bridge; [...] "but at a {{time like}} this I rather hope so--I'd like to come back and haunt this bunch of rat brained rubes." ...|$|E
6000|$|Danny is so used {{to narrow}} escapes that he doesn't waste any time {{thinking}} about them. He didn't this time. [...] "He who tries to look two ways at once is pretty sure to see nothing," [...] says Danny, {{and he knew that}} if he <b>thought</b> too <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the things that had already happened, he couldn't keep a sharp watch for the things that might happen.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not afraid}} of that," [...] said Eames, {{with a touch of}} scorn in his voice. [...] "There isn't <b>much</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> white {{feathers}} nowadays,--not in the way of fighting duels." ...|$|R
50|$|Ran Ayukawa/B-Fighter Tentou (Ayukawa Ran/Bī Faitā Tentō) is an 18-year-old cyber engineer, who {{sometimes}} <b>thought</b> too <b>much</b> <b>about</b> mechanics and ignored the natural side. She had feelings for Julio when he {{taught her to}} appreciate nature. Ran loved to eat and was skilled at playing the shamisen, a stringed Japanese instrument. She left her parents' home at 15. As Tentou (unlike Reddle before her), Ran's armor was modeled after a ladybug.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Sims spoke {{little of}} his disappointments. But I {{knew that he}} <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> them. They set him wondering. There were changes here that to the {{thoughtful}} mind called for investigation.|$|E
6000|$|Two days later, with pictures, wicker chairs, a rug, she {{had made}} the waiting-room habitable; and Kennicott admitted, [...] "Does look a lot better. Never <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it. Guess I need being bullied." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, dear, {{you must}} {{forgive me if}} I persist. I have <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it, and I'm sure you will not oppose me when I am doing what I think to be my duty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{it is as}} I feared," [...] sighed Marian. [...] "I {{wonder how}} it is that I have <b>thought</b> so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> myself; but it would come into my head, what was to become of us, and I was very much afraid of living with the Lyddells; but still there was a little glimmering of hope that {{you might be able to}} manage to leave us with the Wortleys." ...|$|R
60|$|The unhappy Neangir {{on reading}} these two letters--of which he {{understood}} absolutely nothing--felt sadder and more lonely than ever. It soon {{dawned on him}} {{that he must be}} the son of the man who had written to Mohammed and his wife, but he did not know where to look for him, and indeed <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> more <b>about</b> the people who had brought him up and whom he was never to see again.|$|R
50|$|Papa vs Pretty {{primarily}} play alternative {{rock and}} indie rock music, but have also integrated elements of grunge, hard rock, funk rock, and electronica in the past. Lyrically, Papa vs Pretty songs {{have been described}} as often dealing with themes of disenfranchisement, lost love, human emotions, technology, and the state of the world, however Rawle, whilst accepting these as legitimate interpretations of his lyrics, says he's never <b>thought</b> that <b>much</b> <b>about</b> what he writes.|$|R
