5|$|The UN Charter {{stipulates}} that each primary {{organ of the}} United Nations can establish various specialized agencies to fulfil its duties. Some best-known agencies are <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Agency,</b> the Food and Agriculture Organization, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), the World Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO). The UN performs most of its humanitarian work through these agencies.

5|$|After {{returning}} to Earth, Van den Berg {{continued to work}} on crystal growth experiments at EG in California and he became the head for the section of materials science. At a later time he moved to Florida to become a chief scientist at the Constellation Technology Corporation. At age 72, he continued to work up to 40 hours a week and grow crystals, a process he compares to gardening. The crystals he grows (Mercuric Iodide crystals) are used to make precision detectors for nuclear radiation. These detectors are used in medical applications, by the defense industry and <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Agency.</b>|$|E

5|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cold War, India has {{increased}} its economic, strategic, and military co-operation with the United States and the European Union. In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Agency</b> and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state. India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada.|$|E

5|$|The 1972–73 {{debate over}} French nuclear {{testing in the}} Pacific mobilised several groups, {{including}} some trade unions.

In 1973 Australia's concerns {{saw it as a}} champion and an early adopter of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and around this time, the Government ratified the Seabed Arms Control Treaty.

Lester B. Pearson, the Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs, was awarded the prize in 1957 for his role in organizing the UN's first peacekeeping force to resolve the Suez Crisis. UNICEF won the prize in 1965, the International Labour Organization in 1969, the UN Peace-Keeping Forces in 1988, <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Agency</b> (which reports to the UN) in 2005, and the UN-supported Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 2013.
