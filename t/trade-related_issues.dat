40|$|Abstract The {{transition}} from a command economy to a market-based economy has been remarkably successful in China. After 15 years of negotiations, China finally joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 2001. Because of trade and investment liberalization under the WTO, there will be greater competition between Chinese and foreign firms, both inside China and outside China. While {{there is a great}} deal of economic literature on China’s entry to the WTO, there has been no research on the global marketing impact and implications of China’s membership of the WTO. This paper is an attempt to fill this gap. The objective of this study is to examine the general impact of China’s entry to the WTO and to assess the global marketing implications of specific <b>trade-related</b> policy <b>issues</b> within the WTO framework for China.

40|$|In {{the process}} of {{conducting}} {{a new round of}} World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations in Seattle in December 1999, the United States proposed that the so-called social clause, which was pronounced {{to protect the rights of}} workers, be incorporated into the agreements of the WTO, thus linking trade with labor standards. The United States further insisted that countries that do not conform to these internationally recognized labor standards be subjected to trade sanctions. Although this proposal of the United States was hurriedly withdrawn when it faced a wall of loud protest from many quarters, the debate over the social clause has nonetheless continued to foment. Indeed, it is quite likely that <b>trade-related</b> problemsâincluding <b>issues</b> of workers' rights as well as environmental problemsâare bound to be focal points of the multilateral WTO negotiations in the twenty-first century. The following article will attempt primarily to conduct a concrete analysis of the major problems related to this matter, such as the impact that the core labor standards will have on our nation, and the question of how we in China will respond.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the labor market and international trade is a broad and complex subject {{that has been the}} focus of significant attention in recent years. Discussion and analysis in this area has covered a number of discrete issues, including the effect of shifting trade patterns on employment levels and earnings in domestic markets, the impact of wage levels and labor legislation on the location of production facilities, and the positive and negative aspects of the cross-border movement of workers, among others. The continuing importance of labor issues within the larger trade debate is highlighted by the inclusion of measures relating to labor standards and/or the cross-border movement of workers in recent bilateral and multilateral trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), and the U.

40|$|There is the {{increasing}} importance of understanding the link between competition and trade policy and of exploring the gaps and problems that at present exist {{in the application of}} these policies. Trade and competition policies are closely related. Competition policy is aimed at ensuring the efficient functioning of markets by the removal or control of restrictive business practices. Trade liberalisation serves to sharpen competition in the domestic markets while barriers to trade which shelter particular domestic industries may have anti-competitive effects on national markets. It has become apparent how closely trade problems are linked with domestic industrial, regional or even macro-economic policies with which competition policy is also concerned. The {{purpose of this article is}} to examine both conditions of conflict and conditions of synergy between competition policy and the various instruments of trade policy. The article is organised in three parts. The first one discusses a range of trade policy measures, in particular non-tariff barriers from the perspective of competition policy. The second part is concerned with <b>trade-related</b> competition <b>issues,</b> i. e. those practices by enterprises or, as appropriate, by governments in their commercial activities which fall within the scope of competition policy and which have implications for international trade.

40|$|Many {{developing}} {{countries have been}} reluctant to participate in multilateral trade negotiations except for those on agriculture and services, topics mandated under previous World Trade Organization (WTO decisions. The author argues that {{developing countries}} can gain significant benefits from a broader WTO Millennium Round of negotiations but must develop strategies for participating in it. Different groups will have different interests, but developing countries as a group may want to include additional issues in the new Round, especially, industrial tariffs and trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights. It may also be to their advantage to include discussions on <b>trade-related</b> environmental <b>issues</b> and government procurement, if they obtain the institutional support they need to meet their commitments under any new agreements. Other topics should be resisted because they are premature or counterproductive or do not promise net benefits for most developing countries. The new Round should be a single undertaking, to maximize tradeoffs across issues and for political economy reasons: to permit liberalizing forces everywhere to exert pressure on governments to liberalize world trade. But there should not be too many issues, as that would strain the capacities of the poorer and least developed economies. In a new WTO Round, developing countries should be prepared to exchange liberalizing trade concessions on a most-favored-nation basis. Liberalization of their own trade in exchange for improved access to the markets of their trading partners, most of which are other developing countries, {{is the only way to}} maximize benefits from multilateral trade negotiations. Efforts to obtain special and differential treatment should focus on establishing realistic transition periods and technical assistance to address constraints on their institutional capacity.

It then reviews the overall outcome of Phase 1 and the Commission's proposals for the conduct of Phase 2 negotiations. On market-access issues it identifies the following areas of divergence: the need for a non-punitive alternative for non-LDC ACP members, so that no ACP state is worse off 'whether or not ACP countries participate in EPAs'; the need for a five-year moratorium on the commencement of tariff dismantling by ACP countries; the linking of the implementation of tariff dismantlement to the attainment of certain development indicators by ACP countries; revision of the rules of origin. On agriculture and fisheries issues it identifies the following areas of divergence: on the need for effective programmes of support for processing, marketing, distribution and transport prior to the implementation of EPAs; the need for a standstill on EU SPS measures for five to ten years and the establishment of a detailed dialogue on how genuine EU health concerns can be addressed; the need to comprehensively address CAP distortions linked to the new systems of farm support that the EU is creating; addressing the impact of CAP reform on the value of existing preferences; the need for an ACP-EU framework for fisheries agreements. On development issues it identifies the following areas of divergence: the need for additional resources to support necessary economic restructuring; the need to improve the deployment and effectiveness of EU aid instruments. the sequencing of regional integration and market opening towards the EU; issues in EU assistance to fiscal and economic restructuring. On trade in services it identifies the following areas of divergence: the need for additional funds to support service-sector development in ACP countries; the opening up of the free movement of persons within any agreement on trade in services; the scope of trade in services negotiations. On trade-related areas it identifies the following areas of divergence: the scope of negotiations on trade-related areas; the centrality of capacity building in ACP countries around these issues prior to the launch of any negotiations.

40|$|Abstract: The {{founders of}} the WTO placed {{priority}} on raising standards of living and on sustainable development and expansion of trade was a means to achieve these ends. However, such broad objectives are now being equated by many with the broadening of the means as well. Such a tendency could be found even during the Uruguay Round of negotiations. The inclusion {{of a range of}} <b>trade-related</b> <b>issues</b> in the WTO implies opening the window for never ending non-trade issues. Against this backdrop, the paper revisits the ‘means ’ and ‘ends ’ of the WTO in the context of <b>trade-related</b> <b>issues.</b> The existing trade-related agreements at the WTO, like TRIPs, TRIMs and to some extent, GATS brought heavy obligations on developed countries while ignoring their export interests. The inclusion of the issues of environment and labour standards at the WTO are likely to restrict market access of developing countries without serving the purpose of sustainable development. Similarly, the Singapore issues, although have development implications, are likely put heavy burden on developing countries without bringing commensurate benefits. It must be recognised that the WTO essentially works as a platform for bargaining on market access and development is hardly a concern in the process. Moreover, overloading the WTO in the name of development could destabilise the very institution of the WTO, which may make the developing countries worse-off. It would be a far better option for developing countries to focus on market access and better terms of trade. The WTO needs to look back to its original purpose and instead of broadening the agenda, it must re-shift its paradigm to focus on “trade as an instrument for promoting development ” rather than “development ” per se...|$|E

40|$|The {{latest edition}} of Trade Negotiations Insights {{looks at the}} role of {{sustainability}} impact assessments (SIAs) in assisting ACP countries in preparing for EPA negotiations. It considers {{the development of the}} concept to date and highlights how it could assist ACP countries in identifying vulnerable sectors and structuring moves towards free trade in order to minimise adjustment costs. It notes, however, that the starting point for the SIAs is economic liberalisation, although it does not consider alternatives. This is seen by some observers as a major shortcoming since for certain least-developed countries liberalisation may not be entirely appropriate at this stage in their economic development. The article reports that SIAs have been initiated in two ACP regions, the Caribbean and West Africa. Each SIA has four stages: a screening stage, which seeks to identify those trade and <b>trade-related</b> <b>issues</b> relevant for EPAs; a scoping stage which relates these trade and <b>trade-related</b> <b>issues</b> to economic, social and environmental-sustainability concerns; a preliminary SIA stage, where a first assessment is made of the significant positive and negative effects that an EPA will have on sustainable development;  a mitigation and enhancement measures stage, which seeks to propose specific measures that can be taken to make trade liberalisation more conducive to sustainable development.  It acknowledges the difficulties faced in relating the different fields of economic social and environmental effects to the broad trade agenda to be discussed. This is a particular challenge in the EPA negotiations because of the broad trade agenda under discussion, the complicated regional dimension and the lack of adequate base-line data. A central plank of the SIA approach is stakeholder involvement in the process. The article however acknowledges the absence of effective stakeholder involvement in the SIA process to date, {{as well as in the}} process of drawing up the terms of reference for SIAs, a responsibility which lies entirely in the domain of the European Commission. This has led to questioning of the underlying motivation of the SIA process, with some seeing it as an expensive public-relations exercise by the European Commission, which will have no actual impact on the process of negotiations. Comment: It should be noted that the methodology adopted for SIAs allows no scope for questioning the appropriateness of trade liberalisation or of addressing the important question of the sequencing of regional market integration amongst ACP countries and trade liberalisation vis-à-vis the EU. Equally it does not address the issue of the sequencing of supply-side measures in relation to the pace of trade liberalisation.
