5|$|In {{pictures}} {{taken by the}} Hubble Space Telescope in 1999, the motion of M87's jet was measured at four <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>times</b> the speed of light. This motion is presumably an optical illusion caused by the relativistic velocity of the jet, and not true superluminal motion. However, detection of such motion supports the theory that quasars, BL Lacertae objects and radio galaxies may all be the same phenomenon, known as active galaxies, viewed from different perspectives. It has been proposed M87 could actually be a BL Lacertae object (with a low-luminosity nucleus compared with the brightness of its host galaxy) seen from an unfavorable angle to appreciate the properties {{of that kind of}} galaxy.|$|E

5|$|The annual age-adjusted {{incidence}} rate (AAIR) of PSP {{is thought to}} be three <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>times</b> as high in males as in females. Fishman cites AAIR's of 7.4 and 1.2 cases per 100,000 person-years in males and females, respectively. Significantly above-average height is also associated with increased risk of PSP – in people who are at least 76 inches (1.93 meters) tall, the AAIR is about 200 cases per 100,000 person-years. Slim build also seems to increase the risk of PSP.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{disturbances}} {{can occur}} {{in the early stages}} of the disease and sometimes prior to diagnosis, and increase in prevalence with duration of the disease. The most common cognitive deficit in PD is executive dysfunction, which can include problems with planning, cognitive flexibility, abstract thinking, rule acquisition, inhibiting inappropriate actions, initiating appropriate actions, working memory, and control of attention. Other cognitive difficulties include slowed cognitive processing speed, impaired recall and impaired perception and estimation of time. Nevertheless, improvement appears when recall is aided by cues. Visuospatial difficulties are also part of the disease, seen for example when the individual is asked to perform tests of facial recognition and perception of the orientation of drawn lines. A person with PD has two <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>times</b> the risk of dementia compared to the general population.|$|E
5|$|In June 2011, the NY Waterway-operated East River Ferry line started operations. The {{route is}} a 7-stop East River service that {{runs in a}} loop between East 34th Street and Hunters Point, making two {{intermediate}} stops in Brooklyn and three in Queens. The ferry, {{an alternative to the}} New York City Subway, cost $4 per one-way ticket. It was instantly popular, with two <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>times</b> the number of passengers that the city predicted would ride the ferries. From June to November 2011, the ferry accommodated 2,862 riders on an average weekday, as opposed to a projection of 1,488 riders, and it had 4,500 riders on an average weekend, six times the city's projected ridership; in total, the ferry saw 350,000 riders in that period, over 250% of the initial ridership forecast of 134,000 riders.|$|E

5|$|Cox falsified {{documents}} {{to make it}} appear that he owned properties, and then fraudulently obtained several mortgages on them for five <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>times</b> their actual worth. He acquired millions of dollars this way; estimates report the amount at between US$5 and $25 million. Cox's first conviction occurred in 2002 when he was sentenced to probation for mortgage fraud. He was then fired from the mortgage broker position he held in a Tampa, Florida area firm. He began his life as a dedicated criminal in central Florida after that offense, before fleeing the area when his activities were discovered. His crime spree continued across the southern US, eventually landing him on the United States Secret Service's Most Wanted list. He was aided by several female accomplices, some of whom are in prison or have served time there for their participation in his fraudulent mortgage practices. Cox was arrested on November 16, 2006. Indicted on 42 counts, and facing prison sentences of up to 400 years, he plea bargained his sentence down to a maximum of 54 years on April 11, 2007 and was sentenced to 26 years on November 17, 2006. He is currently housed in a low-security prison in Florida. His story is well chronicled and has been featured on Dateline NBC, CNBC's American Greed, in Fortune magazine, Bloomberg Businessweek, Playboy magazine, and other media outlets.|$|E

25|$|Increased solar {{ultraviolet}} radiation {{resulting from the}} Antarctic ozone hole has reduced marine primary productivity (phytoplankton) {{by as much as}} 15% and has started damaging the DNA of some fish. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, especially the landing of an estimated five <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>times</b> more Patagonian toothfish than the regulated fishery, likely affects the sustainability of the stock. Long-line fishing for toothfish causes a high incidence of seabird mortality.|$|E
