5|$|The Shinano basin {{supports}} a large range of plant life, including over 1,100 species of plant which grow {{on the river}} bank, in the river bed or more broadly. The basin also {{supports a}} large range of animal life both {{in and around the}} river. However, the development of the river has threatened the continuing existence of a number of different species. Across the country, thirty to fifty (or higher) percent of endangered species are from freshwater river systems and the impact on the Shinano river system is also clear. Primarily this affects fish and amphibians due to their reliance on the river. The construction of weirs and dams to support agriculture and industry as well as the introduction of invasive species and pollution have been the main causes of ecosystem degradation. The Shinano basin provides a habitat for around <b>twenty-five</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> Japan's fish species (around fifty-five of the 200 fish species living in Japan) including both endemic freshwater fish as well as diadromous fish.|$|E

25|$|The term consent is {{typically}} {{defined as a}} subject adhering to an agreement of principals and regulations; however, the definition becomes difficult to execute concerning the topic of organ donation, mainly because the subject is incapable of consent due to death or mental impairment. There {{are two types of}} consent being reviewed; explicit consent and presumed consent. Explicit consent consists of the donor giving direct consent through proper registration depending on the country. The second consent process is presumed consent, which does not need direct consent from the donor or the next of kin. Presumed consent assumes that donation would have been permitted by the potential donor if permission was pursued. Of possible donors an estimated <b>twenty-five</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> families refuse to donate a loved one's organs. Consent is defined as adhering to an agreement of principals.

2500|$|By {{the summer}} of 1998, it was {{apparent}} that Kingdom of the Sun was not far along enough in production to be released in {{the summer of}} 2000 as planned.

2500|$|A major {{difference}} between the Chinese and the Indian coolie trades was that {{women and children were}} brought from India, along with men, while Chinese coolies were 99% male. This led to a high rate of Chinese men marrying women of other ethnicities like Indian women and mixed race Creole women. The contrast with the female to male ratio among Indian and Chinese immigrants has been compared by historians. In Sumatra in the Dutch East Indies just 18,731 Chinese women and 92,985 Chinese men served as coolies on plantations. Chinese women migrated less than Javanese and Indian women as indentured coolies. The number of Chinese women as coolies was [...] "very small" [...] while Chinese men were easily taken into the coolie trade. In Cuba men made up the vast majority of Chinese indentured servants on sugar plantations and in Peru non-Chinese women married the mostly male Chinese coolies. Polyandry was a common practice amongst Indian Coolies. Between 1845 and 1917, <b>twenty-five</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> all Indians brought to the Caribbean were women. With women as a severe minority, their morality was questioned and the actions of men as a result of having so fre women was blamed on the women. Between 1858 and 1859, laws were put into place stating that the ratio of men to women could not exceed 2:1, whereas before it was 3:1. However, there continued to be a severe shortage of women. This gave women a new sense of power when it came to choosing a partner. With a shortage of women, it became the responsibility of the male suitor to provide a hefty dowry to a woman's father, regardless of what caste she came from. Unfortunately, this also put women in a very vulnerable position, especially when alone. Rape was a common occurrence, and there were accounts of women being bound and gagged in their own home by men. Between 1872 and 1900, it was reported that 87 women were murdered with 65 of those being married women who were accused of being unfaithful.|$|E

Hepatitis B is transmitted to infants from their chronic carrier mothers during the perinatal period.

The use of hepatitis B immune globulin and vaccine after birth can prevent up to 90 % of hepatitis B infections in infants.
