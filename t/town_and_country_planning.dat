Holden was approached, and he accepted provided that William Holford also be appointed. Holden's and Holford's City of London Plan (1946–1947) recommended a relaxation of the strict height limits imposed in the capital and the first use in London of plot ratio calculations in the planning process so that buildings could be designed with floor space of up to five times the ground area. For the bomb-devastated area around St Paul's Cathedral, Holden proposed a new precinct around which buildings would be positioned to provide clear views of the cathedral and from which new ceremonial routes would radiate. The heights of buildings would be strictly defined to protect these views. The plan was accepted by the Minister for <b>Town</b> <b>and</b> <b>Country</b> <b>Planning</b> in 1948 and was incorporated into the wider London Development Plan.|$|E

40|$|Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) is {{increasingly}} {{seen as a}} critical issue in the port sector. The SEA and other European environmental directives are mainly perceived as a burden for port development and port professionals often have little knowledge about the reasons why an SEA is necessary. According to a European directive (2001 / 42 /EC) a Strategic Environmental Assessment {{has to be made}} for plans and programmes that can affect the environment. <b>Town</b> <b>and</b> <b>country</b> <b>and</b> spatial <b>planning</b> documents are examples of such plans and form an important step in port development projects which are subject to a strategic planning process. Spatial planning related planning processes not only bring along the obligation to make an SEA, but are also the locus to gear and integrate the requirements of other European environmental directives. Indeed, ports are confronted with legislation on among others nature, ambient air quality, environmental noise and safety. This paper focuses on the situation in the port of Antwerp where an SEA is made within the framework of a strategic planning process, which will result in a renewed land use plan (spatial implementation plan). However, this is not the only SEA that affects the Antwerp harbour. Therefore, some comments are made about the efficiency and existence of planning processes at different spatial scales and about the delimitation of areas in area-based policies...|$|R

40|$|Assignment of the diploma thesis {{came out}} {{as a result of}} the module {{specialized}} studiol called Compact city, dealing with the problematics of the urban sprawl phenomenon in last 20 years in our country. The target of this thesis is to find ways leading to the improvement of life quality within such structures. We are facing the problem of the urban sprawl into the landscape to the detriment of land used for agriculture. We try to move closer to the landscape, which causes our loss of it. We spend long hours by commuting, mostly by car. The time, when the non-renewable sources of energy are getting tinner is on approach and with it the prices of oil are getting higher. Then we will have a choice: commute by car or get to the place of our job by walk. The second option will be highly appreciated. Contemporary czech countryside is loosing its original features in order of becoming residential base for nearby cities. People moving to the countryside are not searching for the job in the agriculture sector. They move there, trying to find a house with a garden in touch of the nearby landscape. Sadly, they do not find what they expect. Their reality is a big house in the middle of a small patch of land, which can not provide them with the intimate sorrounding. Such residential sites are seldom, if ever proposed in relationship towards the landscape as it was common in the case of original countryside. Right-angled properties which are provided with high fences or walls create sharp edges urging towards constructing a new such structure next to it. The thesis is devided into several parts. First part is dealing with changes in the relationship of people towards landscape. Second part is mapping the urban sprawl in sorrounding of Brno. Several parts of Brno and several municipalities, where the phenomenon of the urban sprawl is about to take place or where it took place already were chosen for this purpose. Three chosen localities (Útěchov, Jehnice, Troubsko) undergone detailed analysis and comparison. In the following section of the thesis were defined five areas, which should be monitored during the development of sub-urban localities. The aim of all proposals is to minimize necessary journeys by car. The final part of the thesis is focused on Jehnice <b>town</b> <b>and</b> <b>country</b> <b>plan</b> <b>and</b> spatial regulations zoning is not created.
