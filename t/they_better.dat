25|$|Among {{the criticisms}} leveled at Seduction of the Innocent are that Wertham used a non-representative sample {{of young people}} who were already mentally troubled, that he {{misrepresented}} stories from colleagues as being his own, and that Wertham manipulated statements from adolescents by deliberately neglecting some passages while rephrasing others such that <b>they</b> <b>better</b> suited his thesis.|$|E
25|$|In 1650, a British divine named Thomas Thorowgood, who was {{a preacher}} in Norfolk, {{published}} a book entitled Jewes in America or Probabilities that the Americans are of that Race, which he had prepared for the New England missionary society. Tudor Parfitt writes:The society was active in trying to convert the Indians but suspected {{that they might be}} Jews and realized <b>they</b> <b>better</b> be prepared for an arduous task. Thorowgood's tract argued that the native population of North America were descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes.|$|E
25|$|After the {{founding}} of the empire, the tribal divisions of citizens and freedmen continued, but the only political purpose of the tribal divisions was such that <b>they</b> <b>better</b> enabled the senate to maintain a list of citizens. Tribal divisions also simplified the process by which grain was distributed. Eventually, most freedmen belonged to one of the four urban tribes, while most freemen belonged to one of the thirty-one rural tribes. Under the emperor Tiberius, the electoral powers of the Tribal Assembly were transferred to the senate. Each year, after the senate had elected the annual magistrates, the Tribal Assembly also heard the renuntiatio. Any legislation that the emperor submitted to the assemblies for ratification were submitted to the Tribal Assembly. The assembly ratified imperial decrees, starting with the emperor Augustus, and continuing until the emperor Domitian. The ratification of legislation by the assembly, however, had no legal importance as the emperor could make any decree into law, even without the acquiescence of the assemblies. Thus, under the empire, the chief executive again became the chief lawgiver, which was a power he had not held {{since the days of the}} early republic.|$|E

500|$|Art critic Peter Schjeldahl saw the [...] "over-the-topness" [...] {{endemic to}} American comics, and Eisner's work, as [...] "ill suited to serious subjects, {{especially}} those that incorporate authentic social history". [...] The work {{has been criticized for}} its use of stereotypical imagery; writer Jeremy Dauber countered that these images reflect Eisner's own memories of his youth and the strictures that Jewish people felt in the tenements. [...] Others said caricaturized character designs conflicted with the otherwise realism of the stories; the appropriateness of the style was defended by others, such as Dennis O'Neil, who said that <b>they</b> <b>better</b> reflect the impressionistic way a child remembers the past.|$|E
500|$|... "Variable and Full of Perturbation" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Mark Rozeman, writing for Paste, gave the episode {{a rating of}} 6.9 out of 10 and, despite enjoying several storylines, described the introduction of Tony as [...] "perhaps the biggest misstep in the show's brief history". He felt that the kiss between Tony and Felix {{was an example of}} [...] "taboo-pushing gimmickry" [...] and summarised the episode as [...] "strange experimental tangent". Slant Magazine critic Matt Brennan found the episode [...] "jumbled and strange" [...] but felt that the introduction of Tony was a [...] "delightful twist". He said that Cosima's storyline taking place at the Dyad Institute felt [...] "dry and utilitarian, as though the writers realized <b>they</b> <b>better</b> get their shit together in time to wrap things up". The A.V. Club Caroline Framke gave the episode a C– grade and criticised the [...] "chaotic script", [...] "aggressively flashy direction" [...] and the failed attempts to integrate the [...] "wildly different" [...] subplots. She admired the attempt to [...] "shin a light on a population that's often invisible in the media landscape" [...] by introducing a transgender character, but thought that Tony's character was underdeveloped and [...] "more like a prop than a character". Similarly, Adam W. Kepler of The New York Times felt that Tony was a cliché of trans men—"absolutely nothing [...] haven't seen before"—whose characterisation was overly simplistic.|$|E
500|$|HexaDrive {{handled the}} 2D screen displays, world map {{features}} and lip synching, while Square Enix handled the 3D graphics, such as character models in cutscenes. Lighting effects and in-game assets were improved and updated for HD consoles using the DirectX 11 technology utilized for XV. Alongside this, {{a large proportion}} of the upgrade was done using HexaDrive's in-house engine HexaDrive Engine 2.0. While originally meant to have a cursory role compared to the DirectX 11 elements, it ended up being used far more than anticipated. The resolution was increased from the original game's 480x272 pixels to the 1920x1080 required. Despite all these changes, the team took care that the lighting and shadow effects remained faithful to the look of the original, as updating too much of the game's visual style would fundamentally alter the experience. Due to scheduling, there was sometimes pressure on the HexaDrive team and they experienced difficulties with the hardware as it was their first time developing for eighth-generation consoles. Updating the lighting effects alone took a whole year of development to finish. While updating the characters' appearance, the team were forced to focus on the main characters due to production deadlines, consequently doing less work on NPCs such as Kurasame. For the main characters' gameplay models, the team adapted the models used in the original cutscenes, as they were more detailed than the original gameplay models due to a higher polygon count. Tabata wanted the main characters to remain as true as possible to their original appearances, but due to the cutscene models appearing older than the original gameplay models, they needed adjusting so <b>they</b> <b>better</b> reflected the original models. The team also adjusted the characters' appearances slightly to make them more [...] "charming". Visual optimization was still going on during the game's reveal, with the team needing to create special screenshots of Type-0s characters operating inside the production environments of XV. Ultimately, these visuals gave the team a guide for what the final game should look like, reducing the amount of trial and error.|$|E

2500|$|Bivectors have {{a number}} of {{advantages}} over axial vectors. <b>They</b> <b>better</b> disambiguate axial and polar vectors, that is the quantities represented by them, so it is clearer which operations are allowed and what their results are. For example, the inner product of a polar vector and an axial vector resulting from the cross product in the triple product should result in a pseudoscalar, a result which is more obvious if the calculation is framed as the exterior product of a vector and bivector. They generalises to other dimensions; in particular bivectors can be used to describe quantities like torque and angular momentum in two as well as three dimensions.

2500|$|The words [...] "down" [...] and [...] "up", {{according}} to Fuller, are awkward {{in that they}} refer to a planar concept of direction inconsistent with human experience.

2500|$|In {{psychology}} {{there is}} a law of hedonic asymmetry that says evaluations of good and bad are important but not the same; negative experiences tend to dominate. In other words, people tend {{to dwell on the}} negative more than the positive. Responses to negative situations are automatic and require more attention to process than positive experiences. Allocating more resources to process negative information takes away from resources available to process positive information, thus impeding one’s ability to remember events preceding the negative event. The media equation suggests that people have a similar experience when they encounter a negative experience with media. A study was developed to examine the idea that “negative images retroactively inhibit memory for material that precedes them, while they proactively enhance memory for material that follows them,” (Newhagen & Reeves, 1992, p.25). In other words, will watching negative images on the news prevent someone from remembering information that they learned just prior to viewing the negative material? And conversely, will <b>they</b> <b>better</b> remember information they received just after viewing the negative material? ...|$|E
