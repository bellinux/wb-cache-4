40|$|The {{location}} of segmental glomerular lesions {{in relation to}} the vascular or <b>tubular</b> <b>pole</b> may have diagnostic or prognostic significance. We have developed a model-based method to estimate the distance from a glomerular lesion to a given landmark (vascular or <b>tubular</b> <b>pole)</b> or the glomerular center and applied this to biopsies from 5 microalbuminuric, 5 normoalbuminuric and 7 proteinuric type 1 diabetic patients and 5 normal controls. The distance from each glomerular adhesion to the glomerulotubular junction was measured and divided by the glomerular radius, allowing comparability among different glomeruli, assuming a spherical shape for Bowman’s capsule, an assumption which was validated. The frequency of adhesions in 6 glomerular zones with equal height (zone I adjacent to the glomerulotubular junction and zones II–VI progressively farther away) was determined: 59 % of adhesions were in zone I, 15 % in zone II, 16 % in zone III, 7 % in zone IV and 3 % in zone VI (adjacent to the hilus). In glomeruli with only one adhesion, 82 % of these were in zone I. This new method accurately localizes segmental lesions within glomeruli and revealed a marked predilection in type 1 diabetic patients for segmental sclerosis to develop at the glomerulotubular junction...|$|E

5000|$|Structures for {{overhead}} lines take {{a variety of}} shapes {{depending on the type}} of line. Structures may be as simple as wood poles directly set in the earth, carrying one or more cross-arm beams to support conductors, or [...] "armless" [...] construction with conductors supported on insulators attached to the side of the <b>pole.</b> <b>Tubular</b> steel <b>poles</b> are typically used in urban areas. High-voltage lines are often carried on lattice-type steel towers or pylons. For remote areas, aluminum towers may be placed by helicopters. Concrete poles have also been used. Poles made of reinforced plastics are also available, but their high cost restricts application.|$|R
50|$|Towers {{for support}} of the lines are made of wood (as-grown or laminated), steel or {{aluminum}} (either lattice structures or <b>tubular</b> <b>poles),</b> concrete, and occasionally reinforced plastics. The bare wire conductors on the line are generally made of aluminum (either plain or reinforced with steel, or composite materials such as carbon and glass fiber), though some copper wires are used in medium-voltage distribution and low-voltage connections to customer premises. A major goal of overhead power line design is to maintain adequate clearance between energized conductors and the ground so as to prevent dangerous contact with the line, and to provide reliable support for the conductors, resilient to storms, ice load, earthquakes and other potential causes of damage.Today overhead lines are routinely operated at voltages exceeding 765,000 volts between conductors, with even higher voltages possible in some cases.|$|R
50|$|Steel poles {{can provide}} {{advantages}} for high-voltage lines, where taller poles {{are required for}} enhanced clearances and longer span requirements. <b>Tubular</b> steel <b>poles</b> are typically made from 11-gauge galvanized steel, with thicker 10- or 7-gauge materials used for some taller poles because of their higher strength and rigidity. For tall tower-type structures, 5-gauge materials are used.|$|R
50|$|Shorter masts may {{consist of}} a {{self-supporting}} or guyed wooden pole, similar to a telegraph <b>pole.</b> Sometimes self-supporting <b>tubular</b> galvanized steel <b>poles</b> are used: these may be termed monopoles.|$|R
50|$|FRC poles cover {{a family}} of pole {{materials}} that combine fiberglass (fiber) strength members with a cross-linked polyester resin {{and a variety of}} chemical additives to produce a lightweight, weather-resistant structure. FRC poles are hollow and similar to the <b>tubular</b> steel <b>poles,</b> with a typical wall thickness of 1/4 to 1/2 inch with an outer polyurethane coating that is ~0.002-inch thin.|$|R
50|$|The Phoenix, {{designed}} by Laing and built by themselves {{as well as}} partners McAlpine and Henry Boot, looked much like an AIROH with a central front door, but far less aesthetically pleasing. It was a two-bedroom in-situ preform design with steel frame, asbestos clad walls and an innovative roof of <b>tubular</b> steel <b>poles</b> with steel panels attached. Like all designs, it came pre-painted in magnolia, with green highlights on frames and skirting. Phoenix prefabs cost £1,200 each constructed onsite, while the specially insulated version designed for use on the Isle of Lewis in the Hebrides cost £2,000.|$|R
25|$|The Mindanao and Karuhatan Link {{starts with}} MacArthur Highway on Valenzuela where {{the link to}} the future NLEX Segment 10 will be built.

50|$|One {{third of}} the way along from Commercial Road is a {{slightly}} projecting mock tower with a small stepped pediment, which in addition to the long window openings and box downpipes, provides a degree of verticality. Nevertheless, the overwhelming emphasis is horizontal, mainly due to a series of strikingly rendered bands - wide ones delineating each floor above a row of windows, narrow ones beneath each row, and three narrow bands separating the inscribed company name across the broad stepped parapet. The upper levels are distinguished from the ground floor base line by darker bricks, but more so by the straight awning which shelters the railway siding and loading bays with their steel protective plates and inground tracks. Whereas stages 1 and 2 use Queensland hardwood for joists and beams, stage 3 employs Oregon. The former external double-brick wall delimits stages 1 and 3 on the ground and first floors, while the top showroom floor is one vast expanse with a forest of <b>tubular</b> metal <b>poles.</b> The showroom also has square vents with timber louvers beneath the windows, and the customary sawtooth roof aligned from east to west for optimum lighting. This floor never contained a diningroom, as the Primaries No 1 store provided this facility for clients next door. Nevertheless, it was equipped with the usual array of bale elevators and wool chutes.|$|R
