5|$|This module {{starts in}} one of two ways. If the players have {{finished}} Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, they have been transported to the glacial rift via the magic chain. <b>They</b> <b>will</b> <b>know</b> that they are searching for some force behind the giant alliance. If the players are starting with Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl, then they have been hired by nobles to destroy the frost giants. Either way, a safe, hidden cave is easily found for a base of operations.|$|E
25|$|If {{there is}} a delay before the first innings starts, so that the numbers of overs in the two innings are reduced (but still the same as each other), then D/L will make no change to the target score. This is because both sides {{will be in the}} same {{position}} of having the same number of overs and 10 wickets available, and <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>know</b> this throughout their innings, thus having the same amount of resource available.|$|E
25|$|Starting in January 2016, Austrian {{police forces}} will be trialling the use of body cameras, which {{will be used to}} film their {{interactions}} with civilians. The hope is that this will make the prosecution of any officers who are excessively violent or forceful a lot easier as there will be solid evidence, and also that it will deter officers from behaving violently in the first place, as <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>know</b> they are being monitored. It is unsure how long the trial will last, however as of July 2016 it is still ongoing.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Ruttledge. The poor darlings! I hope <b>they</b> <b>will</b> never <b>know</b> {{what has}} happened.|$|R
60|$|HE. <b>They</b> <b>will</b> {{think that}} a man once loved a woman more devotedly than ever man loved woman before. But <b>they</b> <b>will</b> not <b>know</b> what man it was.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shouldn't {{worry about}} that, Gus. <b>They</b> <b>will</b> make {{themselves}} as scarce as possible, for <b>they</b> <b>will</b> now <b>know</b> that Dodsworth Sadler {{is on the}} lookout for them." ...|$|R
500|$|Harry Parsons, {{described}} his Sealyhams thus: [...] "They make great companions, {{and the way}} they bond with their owners is almost magical. I keep six indoors, and if someone rings about an infestation and asks us to go ratting, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>know</b> and are out of the door in a millisecond. If you train them, they'll retrieve. They'll do anything to please you." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{survivors}} {{split up}} {{into two groups}} {{to head to the}} Others' camp. Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau), Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway), and Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes (Jorge Garcia) walk on land to the camp, bringing guns and ammunition with them. Meanwhile, Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) plan to use Desmond's sailboat to go by sea. Sayid plans to use black smoke as a signal, saying that [...] "this time, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>know</b> that we are coming", a reference to the attacks in the first-season finale. When the boat reaches the Others' camp, Sayid finds it to be deserted. Meanwhile, Michael, Jack, Sawyer, Hurley and Kate engage in a gun battle with some Others that were following them, and Sawyer kills one. Jack confronts Michael about leading the group into a trap, and Michael confesses to the murders of Ana Lucia and Libby. They realize that Michael has led them to a location other than the beach, ruining their former plan to meet up with Sayid. There, they see a large pile of pneumatic tubes, suggesting that the reports sent out from the [...] discovered in the episode [...] "?" [...] had never been read. Shortly after the discovery of the tube pile, they hear whispers, and suddenly Sawyer, Kate, and Jack are incapacitated by electric darts. The hostages, bound and gagged, are brought to a dock, where it appears that the Others are led by Henry Gale (Michael Emerson). Gale keeps his bargain with Michael, returning his son, Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley), to him and giving them an old fishing boat with instructions to sail on a heading of 325 degrees until they are rescued. Michael threatens Henry that he could tell the outside world of the island's location. Henry responds by telling him that it wouldn't matter as they {{would not be able to}} find the island, should they return. He also gives Michael a counter-threat: if he did tell people of the island's location, people would know what he did to get his son back. Michael reluctantly accepts but asks who Henry and his people are, to which Henry responds [...] "We're the good guys, Michael". Michael uses the boat to get him and Walt off the island. Hurley is then released and sent back to the other survivors with a message that they are to stay away from the Others' part of the island. As Hurley is let go, the other three captives are taken away.|$|E
2500|$|Some Puerto Ricans saw the {{proposal}} {{as an attempt}} to gain favor with mainland US business interests, to promote Rosselló's declared goal of statehood for the commonwealth. The PRTC was seen as an organizational focus of nationalistic pride among many on the island. Representing a militant extreme, the Boricua Popular Army said, [...] "This sale {{is nothing more than a}} declaration of war. Now <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>know</b> what war is." ...|$|E
5000|$|Players {{who are in}} {{the roster}} spots from 21-30 will not count against a team's cap. <b>They</b> <b>will</b> be <b>known</b> as off-budget players.|$|R

50|$|Only {{the worst}} people <b>will</b> be left; <b>they</b> <b>will</b> not <b>know</b> any good nor forbid any evil (i.e. No one will {{say there is}} no God but Allah).|$|R
2500|$|The USA PATRIOT Act's {{expansion}} of court jurisdiction {{to allow the}} nationwide service of search warrants proved controversial for the EFF. They believe that agencies {{will be able to}} [...] "'shop' for judges that have demonstrated a strong bias toward law enforcement with regard to search warrants, using only those judges least likely to say no—even if the warrant doesn't satisfy the strict requirements of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution", and that it reduces the likelihood that smaller ISPs or phone companies will try to protect the privacy of their clients by challenging the warrant in court—their reasoning is that [...] "a small San Francisco ISP served with such a warrant is unlikely to have the resources to appear before the New York court that issued it." [...] They believe that this is bad because only the communications provider will be able to challenge the warrant as only <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>know</b> about it—many warrants are issued ex parte, which means that the target of the order is not present when the order is issued.|$|E
60|$|MISS SUSAN. Perhaps <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>know</b> {{who he is}} at the woollen-drapers.|$|E
60|$|B.B. I {{will send}} the proper people: <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>know</b> it to do: you shall have no trouble. Good-bye, my dear lady. [He goes].|$|E
6000|$|... "You are right," [...] he murmured. [...] "Nothing {{is known}} yet. Very likely <b>they</b> <b>will</b> not <b>know</b> until the valet goes {{to lay out}} his clothes for dinner.... Dead!" ...|$|R
60|$|Unless my comrades {{read what}} I have here set down, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> never <b>know</b> how near I {{was on that}} day at Benedict, to proving myself a false-hearted American lad.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now children, birds, butterflies, and fairies {{will be glad}} to {{find these}} pretty things {{blooming}} here, though <b>they</b> <b>will</b> never <b>know</b> who planted them," [...] she said, when the last task was done.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{glad you}} know me. Some don't. But they will, presently. <b>They</b> <b>will</b> <b>know</b> me well enough before I get {{done with this}} war." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Take {{that message}} back, and <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>know</b> that I {{received}} this, {{as well as}} if I wrote. Make {{the best of your}} way. Good night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] Pete said, [...] "if the Utes meddle with us we {{will give}} them fits. But I reckon <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>know</b> better than to {{interfere}} with us." ...|$|E
5000|$|March 2015: The Norwegian airport train {{operator}} Flytoget ordrered eight 4-car trainsets (maximum speed 250 km/h) {{to supply}} their 16 trains fleet on their Drammen-Oslo-Gardermoen Airport service. <b>They</b> <b>will</b> be <b>known</b> as Class 78.|$|R

50|$|Informational arc {{ending in}} Vacation Activity {{indicates}} that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> only <b>know</b> Weather Forecast, not Weather Condition, when making their choice. In other words, actual weather <b>will</b> be <b>known</b> after <b>they</b> make their choice, and only forecast {{is what they}} can count on at this stage.|$|R

60|$|I {{wonder if}} by chance {{there was any}} other human eye but mine which traced a {{connection}} between these paragraphs. I never showed them to my wife or to Mordaunt, and <b>they</b> <b>will</b> only <b>know</b> of their existence when they read these pages.|$|R

6000|$|... "They don't know you. When they do, they will. Now {{they only}} see what looks like--forgive me, Lena--caprice and coquetry; <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>know</b> you in earnest, {{if you will}} let them." ...|$|E
50|$|In summer 2016 Eibar {{expanded}} its club structure further by integrating Urkomendi (of the 6th level Preferente de Guipúzcoa) into the organisation as a reserve team {{to act as}} a link between the youth level and Vitoria. <b>They</b> <b>will</b> be <b>known</b> as Eibar Urko.|$|R
