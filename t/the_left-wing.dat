5|$|After {{the first}} free elections, {{with the end}} of the Estado Novo period, only right-wing parties have governed the city: the city council was governed by the CDS between 1976 and 1989 and since then by the PSD. The CDS saw its {{popularity}} suffer an abrupt decline in 1997, and has since then been the third political party. On the other hand, the PSD in the same year achieved its first absolute majority with 62.4% of the votes. After the 2017 municipal elections, seven councilmen were members of the centre-right Partido Social Democrata (PSD), and two of the centre-left Partido Socialista (PS). The mayor is Aires Pereira, for the PSD, elected with 57.7% of the votes. The PSD holds the majority of public offices both in the Municipal Assembly and in the administrative parishes. Póvoa de Varzim Assembly is singly elected and comprises 27 members, with the PSD holding 16 seats, the PS 6, the right-wing CDS 2 and one member for <b>the</b> <b>left-wing</b> Left Bloc, the green party People–Animals–Nature (PAN) and one for <b>the</b> <b>left-wing</b> CDU.|$|E

50|$|A key {{theme of}} the {{campaign}} of the coalition was the portrayal of itself as representing <b>the</b> authentic <b>left-wing,</b> as opposed to <b>the</b> established <b>left-wing</b> parties. <b>The</b> coalition made use of radio transmissions of its own (Radio Unitat pel Socialisme), broadcasting eleven hours daily. International participants in the election campaign included the Irish activist Bernadette Devlin (former Member of the British parliament) and <b>the</b> Peruvian <b>left-wing</b> parliamentarian Hugo Blanco.|$|R
50|$|On the left, Barbara Egger-Jenzer, Andreas Rickenbacher, Philippe Perrenoud (all Social Democrats) and Bernhard Pulver (Greens) were re-elected, {{retaining}} <b>the</b> <b>left-wing's</b> {{control over}} <b>the</b> executive.

5|$|In Guatemala, a CIA-backed {{military}} coup ousted <b>the</b> <b>left-wing</b> President Jacobo Árbenz in 1954. The post-Arbenz government—a military junta headed by Carlos Castillo Armas—repealed a progressive land reform law, returned nationalized property {{belonging to the}} United Fruit Company, set up a National Committee of Defense Against Communism, and decreed a Preventive Penal Law Against Communism {{at the request of}} the United States.|$|E
5|$|In {{a second}} major defeat for the Polish right wing, the {{elections}} were won by an SLD candidate, Aleksander Kwaśniewski, who received 51.72% of votes. A Solidarity call for new elections went unheeded, but the Sejm {{still managed to}} pass a resolution condemning the 1981 martial law (despite the SLD voting against). Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>left-wing</b> OPZZ trade union had acquired 2.5 million members, {{twice as many as}} the contemporary Solidarity (with 1.3 million).|$|E
5|$|In early 1926, {{the general}} was again named Premier, and {{approached}} the PNR and its close ally, the Peasants' Party, proposing a merger around his leadership. This met with a stiff refusal, as {{it seemed that the}} two were about to win the elections with additional support, but the king, suspicious of <b>the</b> <b>left-wing</b> credentials of the Peasants' Party, used his Royal Prerogative and nominated Averescu as premier (with PNL support).|$|E

5|$|The FBI {{engaged in}} a number of illegal {{practices}} in its pursuit of information on Communists, including burglaries, opening mail and illegal wiretaps. The members of <b>the</b> <b>left-wing</b> National Lawyers Guild were among the few attorneys who were willing to defend clients in communist-related cases, and this made the NLG a particular target of Hoover's. The office of this organization was burgled by the FBI at least fourteen times between 1947 and 1951.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of San Stefano {{was signed}} on 3 March 1878 by Russia and the Ottoman Empire, and {{included}} a provision {{to set up}} an autonomous Bulgarian principality roughly on the territories of the Second Bulgarian Empire. 3 March has since become Liberation Day, a public holiday in Bulgaria, though the holiday was suppressed and fell out of favour following <b>the</b> <b>left-wing</b> uprising in 1944.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>left-wing</b> preoccupations {{were also}} an {{important}} feature of Libertatea. Its opening manifesto called for a large-scale social reform, which it claimed {{was more important to}} Romanians than any National Liberal project to recover Transylvania from its Austro-Hungarian overlord. It enlisted contributions, generally less political than those at Seara, from literary figures such as Vinea, Demostene Botez, I. Dragoslav, Adrian Maniu and I. C. Vissarion.|$|E

5|$|After Labor's defeats at {{the hands}} of the United Australia Party (UAP) at the 1932 and 1935 state elections, Heffron became {{associated}} with a small group in caucus and in the NSW Labor Council who aimed to depose Lang as leader. However, while Heffron's movement was based on his personal stronghold in his BotanyMaroubra ALP branches and <b>the</b> <b>left-wing</b> trade unions, Lang maintained majority control of the caucus, party machine and the party newspaper, Labor Daily.|$|E
5|$|At the 1906 election, Deakin {{remained}} Prime Minister {{even though}} Labour gained considerably more seats than the Protectionists. When Watson resigned in 1907, Fisher succeeded him as Labour leader, although Hughes and William Spence also stood for the position. Fisher {{was considered to}} {{have a better understanding of}} economic matters, was better at handling caucus, had better relations with the party organisation and the unions, and was more in touch with party opinion. He did not share Hughes' passion for free trade or that of Watson and Hughes for defence (and later conscription). In political terms he was a radical, on <b>the</b> <b>left-wing</b> of his party, with a strong sense of Labour's part in British working-class history.|$|E

5|$|Atrash {{continued}} to hold the office of RCC, and was reelected as speaker on 15 February 1966, shortly before the 1966 Syrian coup d'état (21–23 February), which brought <b>the</b> <b>left-wing</b> neo-Ba'athist government of Jadid to power and caused an internal party split. The Jadid government's coming to power resulted in the self-imposed exile of the leading Ba'ath ideologue Michel Aflaq. Atrash, a partisan of Aflaq, was arrested and jailed in the Mezzeh Prison during the coup. The new defense minister and future president Hafez al-Assad later paid him a visit to discuss Syria's political situation and check on his health.|$|E

5|$|His {{grouping}} {{lost much}} of its supporters to the newly formed National Peasants' Party, and scored under 2% in the 1927 elections. Around 1930, Averescu began opposing the universal suffrage he had endorsed earlier, and issued an appeal to the intellectuals in order to have it discarded from legislation on the basis that it was easily influenced by the parties in power. He and his supporter, the pro-authoritarian poet Octavian Goga, received criticism from <b>the</b> <b>left-wing</b> Poporanist journal Viața Românească, who claimed that Averescu had in fact provoked and encouraged widespread electoral irregularities during his time in office.|$|E

5|$|In the 2007 Labour Party {{leadership}} election, Benn backed <b>the</b> <b>left-wing</b> MP John McDonnell in his unsuccessful bid. In September 2007, Benn {{called for}} the government to hold a referendum on the EU Reform Treaty. In October 2007, at the age of 82, and when it appeared that a general election was about to be held, Benn reportedly announced that he wanted to stand, having written to his local Kensington and Chelsea Constituency Labour Party offering himself as a prospective candidate for the seat held by the Conservative Malcolm Rifkind. However, there was no election in 2007, and the constituency was subsequently abolished.|$|E
5|$|Milne's form at Bristol City {{was enough}} to {{convince}} Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson {{that he was still}} worth a contract with a top-flight club. In November 1988 he moved to Old Trafford in a £170,000 deal. Ferguson was looking to build a title winning side two years after joining United, but had seen his side finish second in the league the previous season and now they were on a winless run in the league that saw them mid-table. He put Milne on <b>the</b> <b>left-wing</b> as Gordon Strachan was already established on the right-wing.|$|E

Precursors of this counterculture subversive humor in film were two non-"college movies", M*A*S*H, a 1970 satirical dark comedy, and The Kentucky Fried Movie, a 1977 formless comedy consisting of a series of sketches (which was also directed by Landis).|$|E
