5|$|In 1980, chief agent John Douglas, {{working with}} {{agents in the}} FBI's Behavioral Sciences Unit, issued a {{psychological}} profile of the unidentified bomber which described <b>the</b> <b>offender</b> as a man with above-average intelligence with connections to academia. This profile was later refined to characterize <b>the</b> <b>offender</b> as a neo-Luddite holding an academic degree in the hard sciences, but this psychologically based profile was discarded in 1983 {{in favor of an}} alternative theory developed by FBI analysts concentrating on the physical evidence in recovered bomb fragments. In this rival profile, the bomber suspect was characterized as a blue-collar airplane mechanic. A 1-800 hotline was set up by the UNABOM Task Force to take any calls related to the Unabomber investigation, with a $1million reward for anyone who could provide information leading to the Unabomber's capture.|$|E
5|$|The gibbet {{could be}} {{operated}} by cutting the rope supporting the blade or by {{pulling out the}} pin that held the rope. If <b>the</b> <b>offender</b> was to be executed for stealing an animal, a cord was fastened to the pin and tied to either the stolen animal {{or one of the}} same species, which was then driven off, withdrawing the pin and allowing the blade to drop.|$|E
5|$|While {{some of the}} {{description}} may have been accurate, many puritanical embellishments were added to better fit the moral story being portrayed by the authorities. The modern medical condition that best fits {{the description}} of the infant is anencephaly, meaning partial or complete absence of a brain. This episode was just the beginning of the attention emanating from Dyer's personal tragedy. The religion of the Puritans demanded a close look at all aspects of one's life for signs of God's approval or disapproval. Even becoming a member of the Puritan church in New England required a public confession of faith, and any behavior that was viewed by the clergy as being unorthodox required a theological examination by the church, followed by a public confession and repentance by <b>the</b> <b>offender.</b> Such microscopic inspection caused even private matters to become looked at publicly for the purpose of instruction, and Dyer's tragedy was widely examined for signs of God's judgment. This led to a highly subjective form of justice, an example of which was the 1656 hanging of Ann Hibbins whose offense was simply being resented by her neighbor. In Winthrop's eyes Dyer's case was unequivocal, and he was convinced that her monstrous birth was a clear signal of God's displeasure with the antinomian heretics. Winthrop felt that it was quite providential that the discovery of the monstrous birth occurred exactly when Anne Hutchinson was excommunicated from the local body of believers, and exactly one week before Dyer's husband was questioned in the Boston church for his heretic opinions.|$|E
50|$|Flagellation {{took place}} either {{with a single}} whip or, more notoriously, with the cat o' nine tails. Typically, <b>the</b> <b>offender's</b> upper half was bared and he was {{suspended}} by the wrists beneath a tripod of wooden beams (known as 'the triangle'). In many cases, <b>the</b> <b>offender's</b> feet barely touched ground, which helped to stretch the skin taut and increase the damage inflicted by the whip. It also centered <b>the</b> <b>offender's</b> weight in his shoulders, further ensuring a painful experience.|$|R

50|$|Another device used {{to immobilise}} {{offenders}} was a birching table, used in Scotland, with two {{holes in it}} through which <b>the</b> <b>offender's</b> arms were inserted but otherwise left free and untied. <b>The</b> <b>offender's</b> feet were tied into position and a strap fastened immediately above the waist.|$|R

40|$|The {{population}} of incarcerated sex offenders in Malaysia is steadily growing. Objective: This is a descriptive study {{to look at}} what clinical and developmental characteristic are present amongst <b>the</b> sex <b>offenders</b> in Malaysia, which could be possible mitigating factors. Methods: Data was collected from offenders located in 3 prisons where <b>the</b> <b>offenders</b> are held. Results: a total of 147 prisoners participated in the study. Slightly {{more than half of the}} victims were below the age of 18, of which 10 were below the age of 12. Three quarters of offenders were thirty years and older, while 12 were below 18 years. However their problems begun much earlier in their life with 50 of <b>the</b> <b>offenders</b> reporting that they had difficulties in their primary support group, resulting in them feeling their families were less expressive, their parents were distant and unsupportive. 29 of <b>the</b> <b>offenders</b> had not lived with their parents from the age of 16. More than half of <b>the</b> <b>offenders</b> reported academic, behavior and developmental difficulties; they reported losing interest in their studies and were struggling during their schooling days. 43 had history of aggressive behaviour during their adolescent years and 76 had peers who often indulged in risky behaviors. 85 of <b>the</b> <b>offenders</b> were Muslim. 40 made the criteria of Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder and conduct disorder while a quarter were diagnosed with having personality disorder. Slightly more than half of <b>the</b> <b>offenders</b> had alcohol and drug-related problems, 36 had history of previous crimes, mainly drug and theft offence. Conclusion: The findings show that <b>the</b> sex <b>offenders</b> are indeed a heterogeneous group with pervasive familial, behaviour, academic and social problems which are possible risk that can be identified early in <b>the</b> lives of <b>offenders...</b>|$|R

Logit regression indicated that contextual factors were associated with <b>the</b> <b>offender’s</b> final decision to confess after controlling for <b>the</b> <b>offender’s</b> initial decision. Multinomial regression further showed that offenders with a lengthy criminal record, advised by a lawyer, and facing drug-related charges characterized by weak police evidence were less likely to confess to the police, even when they initially planned to do so.

25|$|A {{perpetrator}} {{found guilty}} {{by the court}} is often required to receive treatment. There are many options for treatment, some more successful than others. The psychological factors that motivated the convicted perpetrator are complex but treatment can still be effective. A counselor will typically evaluate disorders that are currently present in <b>the</b> <b>offender.</b> Investigating the developmental background of <b>the</b> <b>offender</b> can help explain {{the origins of the}} abusive behavior occurred in the first place. Emotional and psychological treatment has the purpose of identifying predictors of recidivism, or the potential that <b>the</b> <b>offender</b> will commit rape again. In some instances neurological abnormalities have been identified in the perpetrators, and in some cases they have themselves experienced past trauma. Adolescents and other children can be the perpetrators of rape, although this is uncommon. In this instance, appropriate counseling and evaluation are usually conducted.|$|E
25|$|The police may, {{as well as}} issuing {{the normal}} {{cautions}} (which are unconditional), issue conditional cautions. The recipient {{of any kind of}} caution must admit his guilt of the offence for which the caution is imposed. Conditional cautions must be issued in accordance with a code of practice, issued by the Home Secretary. They will impose conditions upon <b>the</b> <b>offender.</b> If those conditions are breached <b>the</b> <b>offender</b> may then be prosecuted for the offence. The Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 extends the adult conditional caution scheme to young offenders.|$|E
