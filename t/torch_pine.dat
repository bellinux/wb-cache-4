So, because of this, they have been classed as Least Concern on the red list category and criteria. For these reasons, there is no current conservation effort to try save sand flounder, but as it is one of the most important commercial fishes in New Zealand ongoing research on the harvest levels and population numbers of this species is needed to make sure that they do not leave the Least Concern class and so that they know if they do, conservation efforts can be made.|$|R

Like Shiimii and New Year's Eve (v.s.), Obon is a significant holiday in the ancestors worship of Ryukyu religion, and the attendance of members of extended families is almost required. The first day of Obon is called unkee. The family altar and memorial tablets cleaned and decked with incense, fruit, and sugarcane (uji) offerings. A simple offering of rice, beans, and water (minnuku) is prepared for spirits who receive no regular attention and accompany ancestors into the home. Often offerings may spill over onto low tables set {{up in front of}} the buchidan. On the offerings may be placed a sangwaa (v.inf.) The family gate (jo) is then lit with <b>pine</b> <b>torch,</b> candles, or incense. The second day (naka nu hi) is rather uneventful.

60|$|We made no halt, but {{passing the}} crowd {{collected}} on the lawn, {{we went through the}} gateway, and only came to a stand when we had reached the centre of the court. As all the arrangements had been previously made, {{the next step was to}} inter the body. I knew that General Littlepage had often officiated on such occasions, and a request to that effect was made to him, through Tom Bayard. As for myself, I said not a word to any of my own family, begging them to excuse me until I had seen the last offices performed to the remains of my friend. In half an hour all was ready, and again the solemn procession was resumed. As before, Susquesus and Jaap led the way, the latter now carrying a shovel, and acting in the capacity of a sexton. The Indian bore a flaming <b>torch</b> of <b>pine,</b> the darkness having so far advanced as to render artificial light necessary. Others of the party had these natural flambeaux also, which added greatly to the solemnity and impressiveness of the scene. General Littlepage preceded the corpse, carrying a prayer-book. Then followed the bearers with the coffin, the horses being now dismissed. Dus, veiled in black from head to foot and leaning on Frank, appeared as chief mourner. Though this was not strictly in conformity with real New York habits, yet no one thought the occasion one on which to manifest the customary reserve of the sex. Everybody in or near the Nest, females as well as males, appeared to do honor to the memory of Chainbearer, and Dus came forth as the chief mourner. Priscilla Bayard, leaning on the arm of her brother Tom, edged herself in next to her friend, though they had not as yet exchanged a syllable together; and, after all was over, Pris. told me it was the first funeral she had ever attended, or the first time she had ever been at a grave. The same was true of my grandmother, my mother, and both my sisters. I mention this lest some antiquarian, a thousand years hence, might light on this manuscript, and mistake our customs. Of late years, the New Englanders are introducing an innovation on the old usage of the colony; but, among the upper real New York families, women do not even now attend funerals. In this respect, I apprehend, we follow the habits of England, where females of the humbler classes, as I have heard, do, while their superiors do not appear on such occasions. The reason of the difference between the two is very easily appreciated, though I limit my statements to what I conceive to be the facts, without affecting to philosophize on them.|$|R

This, of course, was impossible; but with double consternation Eleanor looked up at what, in the gathering darkness, seemed a perpendicular height. The knight made them understand that all that could be done was to put the sufferer on horseback and support her there in the climb upwards, and he proceeded without further parley to lift her up, not entirely without heed to her screams and moans, for he emitted such sounds as those with which he might have soothed his favourite horse, as he placed her {{on the back of a}} stout, little, strong, mountain pony. Eleanor held her there, and he walked at its head. Madame de Ste. Petronelle would fain have kept up on the other side, but she had lost her mountain legs, and could not have got up at all without the mule on which she was replaced. Eleanor's height enabled her to hold her arm round her sister, and rest her head on her shoulder, though how she kept on in the dark, dragged along as it were blindly up and up, she never could afterwards recollect; but at last <b>pine</b> <b>torches</b> came down to meet them, there was a tumult of voices, a yawning black archway in front, a light or two flitting about. Jean lay helplessly against her, only groaning now and then; then, as the arch seemed to swallow them up, Eleanor was aware of an old man, lame and rugged, who bawled loud and seemed to be the highly displeased master; of calls for 'Barbe,' and then of an elderly, homely-looking woman, who would have assisted in taking Jean off the pony but that the knight was already in the act. However, he resigned her to her sister and Madame de Ste. Petronelle, while Barbe led the way, lamp in hand. It was just as well poor Jeanie remained unconscious or nearly so while she was conveyed up the narrow stairs to a round chamber, not worse in furnishing than that at Dunbar, though very unlike their tapestried rooms at Nanci.|$|R
40|$|After the {{agricultural}} activities, livestock {{is one of}} the oldest economic activity with the settlement of humanbeings This typeof activity is shaped and continues to develop according to geographical features of the land. Landforms and vegetation are the two biggest factors affecting the distribution of cattle and sheep in our country. As it isknown, making goat farming are common in the areas where landforms are rugged and mountainous, agricultural land is limitedand maquis vegetation is common. The barbels which can move and adapt quickly is more common in hilly and sloping terrain. However, in the plain areas where agricultural land increased, the number of barbels is decreasing. Because, the goats that canadapt all kinds of terrain prefer feeding in forests and hilly areas instead of flat land. In the rugged landforms where steppe vegetation is seen, sheep farming is common. However, as the steppe vegetation is notseen in coastal parts of our country, sheep farming is common in limited land which scrub vegetation becomes sparse. As sheepgrown for wool, ıt can not be comfortable in areas where the scrub bushes are seen. But, for the preventation of destroyingforests due to the goats, raising sheep is encouraged instead of raising goat. While this situation reduces the number of goat, itincreases the number of sheep in our country. Cattle farming are common in areas where landforms are plain in our country and the vegetation is meadow and grassland. Inthese areas, dairy farms that enterprise milk and milk products are developing. Even if it is decresing day by day, farming pack animal is still going on in the areas where the land, is piecemeal, poor andunsuitable for motoculture. These animals are utilized to carry load in narrow roads and paths. In this article by examining the distribution of cattle and sheep presence in the villages of Silifke, the effects of landforms andvegetation on the distribution are discussed. There are 74 villages located in the field of research. The area is surrounded byErdemli, on the east; Mut and Gülnar on the west; and Karaman and Mediterranean Sea on the North. The main morphological units of this research area are the mountainous areas that are formed by the Central Toros and theareas that fall out as a result of erosion. (low and high plateaus) % 89 of the area is mountianous and % 11 of it contains grassyplains. The declivity and height increases when you are away from the sea. Due to the geological formation of the land, the flow rate of rain is low. The rain water reaches the sea by leaking from thecracks and cavities. Aksıfat watercourse has this feature. The number of seasonal watercourses rises because of the irregularrainfall. In this area, Göksu is the biggest river, spring of which is near Ermenek. Generally, Göksu River takes nourisment notonly rainfall, but it is also nourished with melting snow near Ermenek and Mut. The flow of the river that increases in winter time,is at the top in March and April. The flow is at the bottom in July and September. The district has the biggest lakes of Mersin. Akgöl that is in Göksu Delta is 1200 hectare and Paradeniz is 350 hectare. The water of Akgöl is soft that takes nourisment fromdrainage channels by pouring its water to Paradeniz. Mediterranean climate is effective in this area. In the district that Mediterranean climate is dominant, the situation changesdepending on the increment of height. Average temperature is about c° 19 and the amount of average rain fall is 572, 2 mm. According to Thornthwaite’s climateclassification 100 (C 2 B 2 S 2 b 4) climate type that is familiar with the influence of ocean is seen (dry-a little moist-at the averagetemperature and water rate is over in winter time). Terra rossa usually lies in the research area. In the areas where the vegetation is rich Brown soil type, in declivitous hillsidescolluvial type of soil and at the bottom of Göksu Valley alluvium type are seen. In addition the red pine forests in the research area, ın the grounds that red pines destroy the shrubs are widespread. As theheight rises the vegetation begins to change and <b>torch</b> <b>pines,</b> cedars and firs are seen. According to 2007 population cencus, the total population of Silifke is 111 698. 52 961 of these people live in the city centreand 58 737 of this population live in towns and villages. % 47. 4 of the total population is in the urban area and % 52. 6 of it is inrural area. In this area there is a city. There are 8 towns and 66 villages and totally there are 75 stable centre of population. Settlement in plateaus are exremely common as a result of animal husbandry and conditions of climate. There are 19 plateaus inthe district. The existence of cattle and sheep and goats spreads under the effect of land forms and vegetation. In the district as the land isdeclivitous and hilly, in the areas where the land is limited the barbels are raised. Barbel raising is banned in the forest, near theforest and in villages on the hillsides as the barbels damage the forests. While the number of barbels is declining day by day, thenumber of sheep is increasing. Cattle raising appears in grandlands while sheep and goats are rare in the flat areas like GöksuPlain. Pack animals and mounts are raised in the areas where the declivity is excessive, {{the agricultural}} lands are restricted and pullinto pieces. According to 2007 data, the total number of cattle, sheep and goat is 108 371. While % 88. 7 (96 167) of these animals aresheep and goats, % 11. 3 (12 204) of them are cattles. The sheep and goats are numerous in the mountainous parts of the district and in the lands that maquis is seen. However theexistence of cattles are dense in grasslands of Göksu Plain. There are 96 167 sheep and goats in the research area according to 2007 data. % 75, 5 (72 612) of the sheep and goats arebarbels,% 24, 5 (23 555) of them are sheepRaising barbels which is traditional and common in the research area {{is one of the}} most important means of livelihood. In the lands where the landforms are mountanious and rugged, the amount of land is limited and where maquis is seen raisingbarbels is pervasive. Generally, as a result of increment of height on the West and on the North of the area, the rate of rasingbarbels is increasing, too. One of the features of this area where raising barbels is of a high percentage that the agriculturalactivities are done as a dry land farming. Namely, there is a problem of watering in these areas. Generally, the existence of barbels is dense in the villages of the area on the North. The existence of barbels is significantlylow as the land is flat and the agricultural doings are important in the villages of Göksu Plain. Morever, in the villages where thenumber of barbels is not much, the maquis isn’t seen. Totaly, there are 12 204 cattles in the district. % 91 (11 084) of the cattles are cows, % 4 (530) of them are horses, % 3 (381) ofthem are donkeys, % 2 (209) of them are mules. The cows have the biggest share all of the cattles’ rate. The cows that are raised for milk and meat are the animals fed mostly. In the areas where the roughness is less, and thegrasslands are common stockfarming is widespread (especially on the settlements on Göksu Plain). Besides this crops that aregrown in the plain are used for as cattle cake. This encourages stockfarming. In the research area where the roughness and declivity is excessive, the lands are limited and small, and the land is not suitablefor motoculture, mounts are raised. Despite the number of them is declining day by day, mounts are benefited from ploughing inthe lands where tractors and other vehicles can’t work and carrying load in the narrow roads and paths. Horses; mules anddonkeys are the mounts that are mostly fed...|$|R

'Aug. 21st.--Thanks to the Fire-King, he {{has done}} for the ancient [...] log-house, though next time he mounts his [...] "hot-copper filly," [...] I do [...] not desire a second neck-and-neck race with him. A sprain of the [...] leg, and {{contusion}} (or confusion) of the head, are {{the extent of the}} [...] damage received, and you will say that it is cheap, considering all [...] things. I had done my 203 miles of marking, and was coming back on [...] my last day's journey, debating whether to push on to Lakeville that [...] night, camp out, or get a shake-down at Randolf's, bringing my own [...] provender, for they live on hominy and milk, except for what he can [...] shoot or catch. It was so dark that I had nearly fixed on sleeping [...] in the bush, when it struck me that there must be an uncommonly fine [...] aurora, but getting up a little rising ground where the trees were [...] thinner, I observed it was to the south-west, not the north. That [...] way there lies prairie land, at this season one ocean of dry bents, [...] fit to burn like tinder, so that one spark would set fifty square [...] miles alight at once. All the sky in that quarter was the colour of [...] glowing copper, but the distance was so enormous that danger never [...] occurred to me till I saw the deer scampering headlong, the birds [...] awake and flying, and my horse trembling and wild to be off. Then I [...] remembered that the wind was full from that direction, and not a bit [...] of water between, nor {{all the way to the}} Lakeville lake. I never [...] knew my beast's pace on the Kingston road what it was through that [...] track, all the rustling and scuttling of the beasts and birds [...] sounding round us, the glare gaining on us, and the scent of smoke [...] beginning to taint the wind. There was Randolf's clearing at last, [...] lonesome and still as ever, and a light in the window. Never was it [...] so hard to pull in a horse; however, I did so. He was still up, [...] reading by a <b>pine</b> <b>torch,</b> and in five minutes more the woman and her [...] children were upon the horse, making for the lake. Randolf took his [...] axe, and pocketed a book or two, and we dashed off together for a [...] long arm of swamp that he knew of, running out from the lake. When [...] we got to the other end of the clearing, I thought it was all up with [...] us. The wall of red roaring flame had reached the other side, and [...] the flame was leaping from the top of one pine to another, making [...] them one shape of quivering red, like Christmas evergreens in the [...] fire, a huge tree perhaps standing up all black against the lurid [...] light, another crashing down like thunder, the ribbon of flame [...] darting up like a demon, the whole at once standing forth a sheet of [...] blazing light. I verily believe I should have stood on, fascinated [...] with the horror and majesty of the sight, and feeling it vain to try [...] to escape, when the burning wings were spreading to enclose the [...] clearing and us with it, but Randolf urged me on, and we plunged [...] through the bush at the best speed we could make, the smoke rolling [...] after us, and the heat glowing like a furnace, so as to consume all [...] power out of us. It was hell itself pursuing after us, and roaring [...] for his prey, the trees coming crashing down, and shaking the earth [...] under our feet, the flame absolutely running on before us upon the [...] dry grass and scrub, and the scorching withering every drop of [...] moisture from us, though not ten minutes before, we had been [...] streaming at every pore.|$|R
