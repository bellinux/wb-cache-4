5|$|Upon her joining, {{however, the}} members of the group are {{targeted}} and murdered one by one. All of their deaths relate to their fears: Mark falls down an elevator shaft, trying to escape from the darkness when the lights go out, and is torn in half. Paul accidentally consumes a cockroach while eating a bag of chips; he is given cleaning solution by a masked figure, and upon drinking it, burns a hole in his throat. Laura begins to suspect these deaths are not accidental. The hospital loses power, leaving Laura, Alison, Darren, Nicky, Dr. Jessica Ryan, and the receptionist Gloria in the dark. Gloria goes to the basement to turn the lights back on, but once the patients return to their rooms, Alison is tied <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed</b> by the Boogeyman. He places maggots on her arms, which burrow into her skin via her self-inflicted incisions, and she kills herself attempting to cut them out.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people in}} town still assert that the Camp is a haven of bliss. I was at the camp to-day, and just in one little corner {{this is the sort}} of thing I found – The nurse, underfed and overworked, just sinking on <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed,</b> hardly able to hold herself up, after coping with some thirty typhoid and other patients, with only the untrained help of two Boer girls–cooking as well as nursing to do herself.|$|E

Seddon went to the doctor, who issued a death certificate without seeing the body, claiming that he was unable to attend due to overwork brought on by an epidemic current in the area at that time.|$|E

25|$|Knorr also {{believed}} that her fourth husband, Chet Harris, had turned Suesan into a witch, so Suesan received the worst of Knorr's abuse. After one severe beating, Suesan ran away from home. She {{was picked up by}} police and placed in a psychiatric hospital where she told staff that her mother abused her. Knorr denied the abuse claims and told the hospital staff that Suesan had mental issues. Authorities did not investigate the matter further and released Suesan back into her mother's custody. Knorr punished Suesan for running away by beating her while wearing a pair of leather gloves. She also forced her other children to take turns beating their sister. In the subsequent weeks, Knorr handcuffed Suesan <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed</b> and ordered her other children to stand watch over her. Knorr refused to let Suesan leave the house and forced her to drop out of school. Knorr also pulled her other children out of school, and most of them never advanced past the eighth grade.|$|E
25|$|She was {{a family}} orientated character, {{particularly}} opposed to change and determined {{to hold on to}} the ever-diminishing traditions of the East End. Most of her storylines were family based, which included various feuds, most notably with Pat Wicks (Pam St. Clement), the ex-wife of her son who showed up in Walford in 1986. Various scandals and hardships were thrown at the character and her family, which she stoically battled through in order to keep the close-knit family that she presided over, together. The character was also used for comedy, most regularly with the other older characters, Dot Cotton (June Brown) and Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin), and she had a tendency to take <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed</b> and feign sickness if she didn't get her own way. Her relationship with son-in-law Arthur (Bill Treacher) was another on-going sub-plot often used for comical effect — Lou portraying the stereotypical nagging mother-in-law and Arthur being the main protagonist for most of her displeasure, although they did share moments of closeness as well.|$|E
25|$|Frida Kahlo {{was born}} in this house in 1907, and it {{remained}} her family home throughout her life. She spent her last thirteen years of it here as well. Frida {{was the daughter of}} Wilhelm (Guillermo) Kahlo, who immigrated from Europe to Mexico and native Mexican Matilde Calderón y González. Frida spent her childhood in this house. She stated that during the Mexican Revolution, her mother would open the windows of this house in order to donate supplies to the Zapata army when it was in the area in 1913. She also spent large amount of time in the house convalescing, first in 1918 when she was struck with polio which would leave one leg shorter than the other. When she was 18, a trolley accident left her badly mangled. She spent about two years confined <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed</b> in casts and orthopedic devices. It was then she began to paint as a way to pass the time. One of the works from this time has Frida on {{what appears to be a}} stretcher, her body bandaged and located to the side of this house.|$|E

While in an old basketball court, Vinnie reunites with an old flame named Rozzie, but their reunion is abruptly interrupted by Rozzie's protective Jewish father, who chains her <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed</b> so she won't meet with Vinnie. Vinnie and Crazy spend the evening drinking, meet up with two prostitutes and go to sleep on the beach, waking up to find themselves close to a group of showering women and their mobster husbands. While Crazy inches over to the ladies, Vinnie finds a dead body buried in the sand. The screams of Vinnie and the women alert the mobsters, who beat up Crazy. It's later seen that Crazy has killed off the mobsters.|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles County Coroners Office was {{assisted}} in their investigation by psychiatrists from the Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Team, who had expert knowledge on suicide [...] It was estimated that Monroe had died between 8:30 and 10:30p.m., and the toxicology report later {{revealed that the}} cause of death was acute barbiturate poisoning. She had 8mg% (milligrams per 100 milliliters of solution) chloral hydrate and 4.5mg% of pentobarbital (Nembutal) in her blood, and a further 13mg% of pentobarbital in her liver. Empty bottles containing these medicines were found next <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed.</b> The possibility that Monroe had accidentally overdosed was ruled out, because the dosages found in her body were several times over the lethal limit. Her doctors stated that she had been prone to [...] "severe fears and frequent depressions" [...] with [...] "abrupt and unpredictable" [...] mood changes, and had overdosed several times in the past, possibly intentionally. Due to these facts and the lack of any indication of foul play, the coroner classified her death as a [...] "probable suicide".|$|E

500|$|As death succeeded death, Dickinson {{found her}} world upended. In {{the fall of}} 1884, she wrote that [...] "The Dyings have been too deep for me, and before I could raise my Heart from one, another has come." [...] That summer she had seen [...] "a great {{darkness}} coming" [...] and fainted while baking in the kitchen. She remained unconscious {{late into the night}} and weeks of ill health followed. On November 30, 1885, her feebleness and other symptoms were so worrying that Austin canceled a trip to Boston. She was confined <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed</b> for a few months, but managed to send a final burst of letters in the spring. What is thought to be her last letter was sent to her cousins, Louise and Frances Norcross, and simply read: [...] "Little Cousins, Called Back. Emily". On May 15, 1886, after several days of worsening symptoms, Emily Dickinson {{died at the age of}} 55. Austin wrote in his diary that [...] "the day was awful ... she ceased to breathe that terrible breathing just before the [...] whistle sounded for six." [...] Dickinson's chief physician gave the cause of death as Bright's disease and its duration as two and a half years.|$|E
500|$|The {{depth of}} the Queen's grief {{over the death of}} her husband {{surprised}} her family, courtiers, politicians and general populace. As when her mother died, she shut herself off from her family—most particularly, the Prince of Wales, (whom she blamed for her husband's death), with the exception of Alice and Beatrice. Queen Victoria often took Beatrice from her cot, hurried <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed</b> and [...] "lay there sleepless, clasping to her child, wrapped in the nightclothes of a man who would wear them no more." [...] After 1871, when the last of Beatrice's elder sisters married, Queen Victoria came to rely upon her youngest daughter, who had declared from an early age: [...] "I don't like weddings at all. I shall never be married. I shall stay with my mother." [...] As her mother's secretary, she performed duties such as writing on the Queen's behalf and helping with political correspondence. These mundane duties mirrored those that had been performed in succession by her sisters, Alice, Helena and Louise. However, to these the Queen soon added more personal tasks. During a serious illness in 1871, the Queen dictated her journal entries to Beatrice, and in 1876 she allowed Beatrice to sort the music she and the Prince Consort had played, unused since his death fifteen years earlier.|$|E
500|$|Three months later, Meg {{returns home}} with the mind and {{attitude}} of a hardened criminal, complete with a new thuggish and rebellious look. She immediately begins abusing her family, retaliating to the many years of abuse she had endured under them, such as curb-stomping Peter, raping him in the shower with a loofah, and using her mother's shirts as toilet paper (while also keeping a [...] "poop bucket" [...] next <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed</b> and refusing to empty it until it gets full). In addition, she continues habits she picked up in prison, and beats up the kids who make fun of her at school (specifically Connie D'Amico and her friends {{with a bag of}} full soda cans which she hits them with, cracking three of the popular kids' skulls open and tongue-kissing Connie afterwards) for which she is suspended. Wanting {{to start a new life}} away from home, Meg ambushes Brian in his car and threatens him with a gun to drive to Mort's Pharmacy so she can rob him. Brian, however, shows her the article he wrote, in which he describes her [...] "far sweeter and kinder" [...] than the typical American girl. Touched by the fact that Brian actually cares for her just as she was, Meg changes her mind and returns home with Brian; having changed back her normal personality in the process. Back at home, she makes a bad joke involving Wesley Snipes, and Peter, presumably not amused at this, ends the episode by saying [...] "Always end on a strong joke".|$|E

When the miller's wife leaves <b>her</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> relieve herself of the wine she's drunk, John moves the baby's cradle {{to the foot of}} his own bed.

500|$|Authors Santiago Fouz-Hernández and Freya Jarman-Ivens {{commented that}} [...] "the video portrayed the deconstructive gender-bending {{approach}} associated with free play and self-reflexivity of images in postmodernism." [...] They had initially thought the video as a feminist approach to sexuality, {{leading them to}} say that [...] "the video might also relate to several core political questions raised by feminism." [...] However, they deduced that the scenes showing Madonna in a seductive manner and chained <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed</b> do not portray women in an empowering position, but emphasizes {{the fact that women}} can be in control because of their sexual prowess. Jarman-Ivens added that the epigraph establishes the status-quo, with a clear distinction of the body (workers, hand, labors) and the mind (elite, intellect capital). Unlike Metropolis, where the line denoted the binary oppositions of the labor class against the elitist, in the video Madonna did not distinguish between the two. Jarman-Ivens noted that the video portrayed both men and women being looked at, actively or passively. The body and the hand are not separate there, instead the heart, hand and head are portrayed as a balance in everybody, male or female. Scholar Theodore Gracyk also noted of the initial portrayal of female sexuality in the video, in his book, I Wanna Be Me: Rock Music and the Politics of Identity, and criticized the video for its portrayal of male domination. However, on close inspection, Gracyk {{came to the conclusion that}} [...] "Express Yourself" [...] was a smart move for Madonna, as it actually portrayed women in a much stronger position. Author John Evan Seery wrote in his book Political Theory for Mortals, that [...] "Madonna with her 'Express Yourself' video splicing together images of machines with images of sex,... represents the ultimate cyborg of late twentieth-century America." [...] Allen Metz felt that the scenes of Madonna grabbing her crotch and dancing were reminiscent of [...] "Michael Jackson's androgynous imitation of phallic masculinity." [...] He went on to compliment the video for its gender-bending depiction.|$|E
