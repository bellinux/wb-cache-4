Unable to forget her, Devadasu is despondent.

5|$|Exterior {{shots of}} Adipose Industries were filmed at the British Gas {{building}} (Helmont House) in Cardiff's city centre. For {{health and safety}} reasons, Tennant was prohibited from performing his own stunts in the window cleaning platform. His only shot that required stunts was when he catches Miss Foster's sonic pen, a shot that took several <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> perfect.|$|E

5|$|The Moon is in {{synchronous}} rotation: it rotates {{about its}} axis {{in about the}} same time it <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> orbit Earth. This results in it always keeping nearly the same face turned towards Earth. However, due to the effect of libration, about 59% of the Moon's surface can actually be seen from Earth.|$|E
5|$|The first {{ionization}} energy is the energy it <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> remove one electron from an atom, the second {{ionization energy}} is the energy it <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> remove a second electron from the atom, and so on. For a given atom, successive ionization energies increase with {{the degree of}} ionization. For magnesium as an example, the first ionization energy is 738kJ/mol {{and the second is}} 1450kJ/mol. Electrons in the closer orbitals experience greater forces of electrostatic attraction; thus, their removal requires increasingly more energy. Ionization energy becomes greater up and {{to the right of the}} periodic table.|$|E
30|$|Convergence {{speed is}} the time <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> reach the MPP (Walker et al. 2011). For a {{high-performance}} MPPT system, the time <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> converge to the required operating voltage or current should be low. The lower time and periodic tuning <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> reach the MPP minimize power losses and maximize efficiency.|$|R

5|$|Benchmarking {{conducted}} by PassMark Software highlights the 2009 version's 52 second install time, 32 second scan time, and 7 MB memory utilization. Symantec funded the benchmark test and provided scripts used to benchmark each participating antivirus software. Tests {{were conducted in}} Windows Vista running on a dual core processor. PC Magazine found the suite added 15 seconds to the boot time, with a baseline of 60 seconds. Norton added less than 5 percent to the time it <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> complete file operations. 25 percent more time was taken to unzip and zip a set of files.|$|E
5|$|Firearms combat is first-person, with {{character}} points {{assigned to}} the firearms skill determining the shot's accuracy {{and how long it}} <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> target an opponent. Melee combat is third-person, with access to weapons such as katanas and sledgehammers for melee combat, or pistols, crossbows and flamethrowers for firearm combat. If a player sneaks up on an opponent, they can perform an instant kill; weapons provide unique instant kill animations. The player can block attacks manually or automatically, by leaving their character idle. They can use stealth in missions by sneaking past guards and security cameras, picking locks, and hacking computers to locate alternative routes.|$|E

5|$|Frequency scaling was the {{dominant}} reason for improvements in computer performance from the mid-1980s until 2004. The runtime {{of a program}} {{is equal to the}} number of instructions multiplied by the average time per instruction. Maintaining everything else constant, increasing the clock frequency decreases the average time it <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> execute an instruction. An increase in frequency thus decreases runtime for all compute-bound programs.|$|E
5|$|Hewson {{emphasised}} that Edun {{would have}} to be profitable to be considered a success, but in this it struggled. She later admitted that the couple were naive about what it <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> make a successful fashion enterprise. Edun encountered problems with both quality of goods and delivery times from their African suppliers, and most of the stores originally carrying the line dropped it. It lost €9.7 million in 2007 and €12.8 million in 2008, suffering {{along with the rest of}} the apparel sector from the credit crisis of 2008.|$|E
5|$|In February and March 2011, Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism {{sponsored}} {{a test of}} the route by shipping roof tiles to Europe via the Trans-Siberian. The tiles were transported by ship from Hamada, Shimane to Vladivostok, then by the railway to Moscow. The transit time was expected to be 30 days, in comparison with the 50 days on average it <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> ship cargo by ship from Hamada to ports in western Russia. If successful, the ministry would use the results of the test to encourage other Japanese companies to utilize the Trans-Siberian over the sea route.|$|E

5|$|Tesla Motors {{designed}} its Model S {{to allow}} fast battery swapping. In June 2013, Tesla announced their goal to deploy a battery swapping station {{in each of}} its supercharging stations. At a demonstration event Tesla showed that a battery swap operation with the Model S takes just over 90 seconds, {{about half the time}} it <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> refill a gasoline-powered car used for comparison purposes during the event. The first stations are planned to be deployed along Interstate 5 in California where, according to Tesla, a large number of Model S sedans make the San Francisco-Los Angeles trip regularly. These will be followed by the Washington, DC to Boston corridor.|$|E
5|$|The band entered Music Box Studios in Los Angeles with Gordon and Fleming in March 1991, {{and worked}} on the album for one week; the songs were {{recorded}} {{over a period of}} four days, and were mixed {{over the course of a}} further three days.

5|$|The {{duration}} of time until an eventual reward also affects participants' choice of immediate or delayed gratification. A 2001 study demonstrated {{that if a}} reward will not be granted for an extensive amount of time, such as 180–300 months (15–25 years), the monetary amount of the reward is inconsequential; instead, {{the bulk of the}} participants choose the immediate reward, even if their delayed reward would be quite large. Delayed gratification has its limits, and a delay can only be so long before it is judged to be not worth the effort it <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> wait.|$|E

5|$|The {{gravitational}} attraction between Earth and the Moon causes tides on Earth. The {{same effect}} on the Moon has led to its tidal locking: its rotation period {{is the same as}} the time it <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the lunar phases; the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the solar terminator.|$|E
5|$|The {{real issue}} is that it moves the moral center more towards the obscene. That it becomes more normal to be more sexually promiscuous, because they are bombarded with imagery that is loaded with innuendo, and that is seen as normal, even preferred... if girls and women find their {{identity}} and self-worth in the approval of people, they will do whatever it <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> become popular and loved. When stars like Rihanna, who blast sexuality, are thrust into the limelight, girls {{tend to think that}} is the way for them to be valuable. God tells us that we are fearfully and wonderfully made... bearing His image. Rihanna is selling a lie.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a variety}} of schools and religious, {{cultural}} and sporting facilities including sailing and wind surfing and golf. One popular ancient local tradition involves the Hobby Horse, or Obby Oss, which <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> the streets for four days {{on the eve of the}} first of May each year, with accompanying musicians and rival horses. The town is the starting point of the South West Coast Path National Trail, the nation's longest long-distance countryside walking trail.
