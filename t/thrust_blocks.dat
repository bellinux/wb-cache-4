50|$|Spigot and sockets {{involve a}} normal pipe end, the spigot, being {{inserted}} into the socket or bell of another pipe or fitting with a seal being made between the two within the socket. Normal spigot and socket joints do not allow direct metal to metal contact with all forces being transmitted through the elastomeric seal. They can consequently flex and allow some degree of rotation, allowing pipes to shift and relieve stresses imposed by soil movement. The corollary is that unrestrained spigot and socket joints transmit essentially no compression or tension along the axis of the pipe and little shear. Any bends, tees or valves therefore require either a restrained joint or, more commonly, <b>thrust</b> <b>blocks,</b> which transmit the forces as compression into the surrounding soil.|$|E
50|$|Built {{with the}} {{steerage}} trade in mind, Homeric {{had a huge}} portion of her accommodations devoted to immigrants, and when the United States curtailed the flow of foreign settlers in the mid-1920s the Homeric was particularly hard hit. Her transatlantic crossings began to lose money as early as 1926, and the ship was sent on cruises around the Mediterranean and Caribbean. Even though the liner had only been in service since 1922, by 1927 she was seriously showing her age. Launched in 1913, her hull and inner workings were nearing twenty years old. Cracks had been discovered in her hull and superstructure, {{as well as the}} <b>thrust</b> <b>blocks</b> in the engine rooms, but like her fleet-mates, the Homeric plied on, sailing at reduced speed to extend the ship's lifetime and avoiding the worst of the North Atlantic’s squalls. In 1928, White Star formally announced the thousand-foot-long Oceanic, meant to replace the aging Olympic and Homeric. However, the new Oceanic was never to be, as White Star was unable to secure the financing for such a ship, and instead built two smaller motorliners, Britannic and Georgic. Once the Georgic entered service, Homeric became surplus on the Atlantic and she was sent cruising full-time. On 1 June 1932, she departed New York on her final transatlantic crossing. Her career on the Atlantic was indeed short-lived, as she only provided transatlantic service for ten years.|$|E
40|$|Bell-and-spigot gasket-joint {{thermoplastic}} pipes such as Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) {{are widely}} used in pressure applications for potable water distribution and transmission, and sewer force mains. The thrust forces which result at joints due {{to changes in the}} direction of flow or changes in the diameter size of a pipeline must be counterbalanced to prevent joint separation. This is accomplished using either concrete <b>thrust</b> <b>blocks</b> or joint restraint devices, or a combination of the two. In the past fifteen years, use of joint restraints in PVC pipes has increased significantly while the use of concrete <b>thrust</b> <b>blocks</b> has lowered. In many parts of the US, both are used in tandem. Traditional joint restraints, “lug-type restraints, ” are external to a piping system and must be fitted {{on the outside of the}} joint, exposing the device to in-situ soils, which makes it susceptible to corrosion. Assembly is also time consuming and prone to human error. When using joint restraints only, without <b>thrust</b> <b>blocks,</b> it is usually necessary to also restrain one or more pipe-to-pipe joints on either side of the fitting. The number of pipe joints or the length of pipe to be restrained on either side of the appurtenance can be calculated based on several parameters. The next generation of joint restraints for PVC pipe-to pipe and ductile iron fitting-to- PVC pipe connections are internal to the system. The BullDog ™ joint is integral to a PVC pipe bell and is intended for pipe-to-pipe joints, while the fitting-to-pipe restraint is a self-restraining gasket, called the MJ Filed Lok®. These devices are easier to assemble than traditional alternatives and much less susceptible to corrosion. Basic design of joint restraints, outlined in the American Water Works Association (AWWA) Manual M 23, PVC Pipe- Design and Installation are discussed and the importance of ASTM F 1674, Standard Test Method for Joint Restraint Products for Use with PVC Pipe, in the selection of joint restraint products, is explained.

40|$|Contemporary {{understanding}} of the behaviour of surging glaciers and ice streams is hampered {{by the lack of}} data on landsystem evolution and sedimentary environments. This study concerns the ice-marginal environment of the surge-type Brúarjökull in Iceland. The sediment distribution in the glacier forefield as well as the morphology, sedimentology and tectonic architecture of the 1890 end moraine is investigated for highlighting the interaction between very dynamic ice and sediment/landform associations. As a result of substrate/bedrock decoupling during the 1890 surge, subglacial sediment was dislocated across the bedrock surface and deformed compressively, leading to gradual substrate thickening and the formation of a sediment wedge in the marginal zone. A drop in subglacial porewater pressure {{at the very end of}} the surge led to substrate/bedrock coupling and a stress transfer up into the sediment sequence causing brittle deformation of the substrate. Simultaneously, the glacier toe ploughed into the topmost part of the marginal sediment wedge initiating the moraine-ridge construction. Fine-grained and incompetent sediment deformed in ductile manner, resulting in a narrow moraine dominated by rooted folds, while coarse-grained and competent sediment deformed in brittle fashion, resulting in a wider moraine dominated by <b>thrust</b> <b>blocks.</b> A new sequential model of subglacial and ice-marginal processes operating during a glacier surge is proposed, illustrating the stepwise formation of a marginal sediment wedge and an end moraine—a twofold, inseparable marginal end-product that formed during the last days of the 1890 surge...|$|E
40|$|Duplexes are {{a common}} feature in thrust belts at many scales. Their {{geometries}} vary significantly from antiformal stacks with significant forethrusting in the cover (e. g. southern Pyrennes, Spain) to triangle zones (e. g. foreland Canadian Rockies) to low-displacement individually spaced ramp-anticlines (e. g. Sub-Andean thrust belt, Bolivia). We present a series of physical experiments demonstrating that {{the strength of the}} décollements relative to that of the intervening and overlying rock layers plays a significant role in controlling the duplex style. The models comprise brittle layers made of dry quartz sand and décollements made of two types of viscous silicone polymers. The strength of the décollements in the models {{is a function of the}} shortening rate applied to the model. The relative strength of the décollements and surrounding rocks affects the development of active- or passive-roof duplexes (triangle zones). It also affects the amount of translation of individual <b>thrust</b> <b>blocks</b> and the spacing of thrust ramps, which in turn determine if a duplex evolves into an antiformal stack or into individually spaced ramp-anticlines. Model results indicate that specific associations of structural features form systematically under similar rheological and boundary conditions. The presence of relatively strong décollements promotes local underthrusting of the cover, individual ramp-anticlines, internal deformation of thrust sheets, low early layer-parallel shortening, and sequential towards-the-foreland propagation of structures. Weak décollements promote forethrusting of the cover, antiformal stacks, coeval growth of structures, and low internal strain...|$|E
40|$|Using high?resolution seismic {{profiles}} {{and other}} geophysical data, collected during R/V Meteor Cruise M 74 / 2, we investigate the distribution patterns of shallow sediments, their structure and deformation processes, {{and their role}} in the migration, accumulation and seepage of hydrocarbon?rich fluids. Here, we show that rapid syn?kinematic sedimentation at the frontal Makran accretionary prism provides a mechanism by which emerging imbricated thrust packets override the footwall at the seafloor without significant mass?wasting and destruction of fault?related anticline in the hanging wall. These anticlines may rise high above the seafloor to form plate?boundary?parallel ridges, and distinguish from simple <b>thrust</b> <b>blocks</b> seen at convergent margins elsewhere. With the fast burial of many thrust faults by the syn?kinematic sediments, anticlinal growth structures form in these syn?kinematic sediments by continuous thrust activity. The anticlinal structures preserved within the cores of the ridges or formed from these syn?kinematic sediments act as structural traps for migrating hydrocarbon?rich fluids, above which fluid escape structures are generated leading to seafloor seeps. Most of the discovered hydrocarbon seeps around Sixth Ridge are sourced from these traps. Despite the compressional environment and the rapid syn?kinematic sedimentation rates, shallow subsurface of the frontal Makran is a normally pressured regime, in which the buoyancy of hydrocarbons may account for the fluid migration. In this important respect, the Makran accretionary prism differs from many other convergent margins and accretionary prisms, where fluid flow is largely driven by tectonically induced overpressure...|$|E

40|$|The {{internal}} {{sectors of}} the Orobic Alps (Northern Italy) are characterised by Alpine age regional shortening showing a transition, through time, from plastic to brittle deformation. Thrust faults cut Alpine ductile folds and are marked by cataclasites and, locally, by pseudotachylytes, suggesting that motion was accommodated by seismic frictional slip. In the Eastern Orobic Alps the thrusting initiated at depths deeper than 10 km (the emplacement depth of the Adamello pluton) and possibly continued at shallower depths. This demonstrates that thrust motion occurred between 10 km depth and the brittle-ductile transition, i. e., at mid-crustal depths. The Orobic Alps exhumed paleoseismic zone shows different geometries along strike. In the central {{sectors of the}} Orobic Alps, thrust faults, associated with pseudotachylytes, have average dips around 40 degrees and show no pervasive veining. Much steeper thrusts (dips up to about 85 degrees) occur in the eastern Orobic Alps. In this area, faults are not associated with pervasive veining, i. e., fluid circulation was relatively scarce. This suggests that faulting did not occur with supralithostatic fluid pressure conditions. These reverse faults are severely misoriented (far too steep) for fault reactivation in a sublithostatic fluid pressure regime, We suggest that thrust motion likely started when the fault, were less steep and that the faults were progressively rotated {{up to the present}} day dips. Domino tilting is probably responsible for this subsequent fault steepening, as suggested by a decrease of the steepness of thrust faults from north to south and by systematic rotations of previous structures consistently with tilting of <b>thrust</b> <b>blocks.</b> When the faults became inclined beyond the fault lock-up angle, no further thrusting was accommodated along them. At later stages regional shortening was accommodated by newly formed lower angle shear planes (dipping around 30 - 40 degrees), consistently with predictions from fault mechanics.

From the Vermion area, samples were collected from the Seli formation (B-SE 1 - 3, limestone), from the upper Ermakia formation (B-ER 4 - 6, limestone), from the Zoodohos Pigi formation (B-ZP, marble) from the lower Ermakia formation (B-ER 1 - 2, limestone) and from the Mesovouno formation (B-ME 1 - 3, dolomite). From the Kozani area, samples were collected from the Ryaki formation (K-RY 1 - 4, dolomite), from the Amygdalea formation (K-AM 1 - 3, dolomite), from the Drepanos formation (K-DR 1 - 3, limestone), from the upper Vatero (K-VA 1 - 3, limestone) and from the lower Vatero formations (K-VA 4 - 5, limestone). From the Siatista area, samples were collected from the Siatista (S-SI 1 - 3), the Kaloneri (S-KA 1 - 3) and the Mikrokastro limestone formations (S-MI 1 - 3). From the Vourinos area, samples were collected from the limestone formations of Kteni (BO-KT 1 - 3), of Prosilio (BO-PR 1 - 3), of Servia (BO-SE 1 - 3), of Fragma Polifitou (BO-FP 1 - 3) and of Rodiani formation (BO-RD 1 - 3).

40|$|To {{search for}} {{local and global}} scale {{geologic}} associations that {{may be related to}} the internal dynamics of Io, we have completed a global catalog of all mountains and volcanic centers. We have identified 115 mountain structures (covering approx. 3 % of the surface) and 541 volcanic centers, including paterae (calderas and dark spots) and shield volcanoes. The average length of an Ionian mountain is 157 km, with the longest being 570 km. The mean height of Ionian mountains is 6. 3 km, and the highest known mountain is Boosaule Montes (17. 5 +/- 3 km). Five basic morphologic types of mountains have been identified; mesa, plateau peak, ridge, and massif. Very few mountains bear any physical similarity. to classic volcanic landforms, but many resemble flatiron mountains on Earth and are interpreted as tilted crustal blocks. This would be consistent with the hypothesis that most mountains are <b>thrust</b> <b>blocks</b> formed as a result of compressive stresses built up in the lower crust due to the global subsidence of volcanic layers as they are buried over time. More than one mechanism may be responsible for all Ionian mountains, however. The proximity of some mountains to paterae may indicate a direct link between some mountains and volcanism, although it is not always clear which came first. In contrast to earlier studies, a pronounced bimodal pattern is observed in the global distribution of both mountains and volcanic centers. The regions of highest areal densities of volcanic centers are near the sub- and anti-Jovian regions, but are offset roughly 90 deg in longitude from the two, regions of greatest concentration of mountains. This anticorrelation may indicate the overprinting of a second stress field on the global compressive stresses due to subsidence. The bimodal distribution of volcanic centers and mountains is consistent with models of asthenospheric tidal heating and internal convection developed by Tackley et al. Over regions of mantle upwelling, compressive stresses in the lower crust induced by global subsidence might be reduced, encouraging volcanism and discouraging mountain building. In regions of mantle downwelling, these compressive stresses in the lower crust might be increased, discouraging volcanism and encouraging mountain building. Alternatively, the global pattern may be related to possible (but undocumented) nonsynchronous rotation of lo, which would produce two regions each of compression and extension in the crust. Evidence of layering and of mass wasting, including landslides, block sliding, debris aprons and downslope creep, on Ionian mountains suggests that the crust of Io is essentially a layered stack of partially consolidated volcanic lavas and plume deposits, becoming more consolidated with depth. The lower crust especially may also be ductily deformed, punctuated by volcanic intrusions and faulting at paterae, and broken into blocks, some of which have been uplifted to form mountains...|$|E

By 1913, the great merits of the tilting-pad bearing had been recognised for marine applications. The first British ship to be fitted out with the bearing was the cross-channel steamboat the Paris, but many naval vessels were similarly equipped during the First World War.
