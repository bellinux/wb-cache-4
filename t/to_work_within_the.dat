5|$|She {{pointed out}} that when the {{discussion}} was reported to Washington, the leading US generals in the U.S. military lobbied Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, claiming {{that it was no}} longer feasible <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> parameters laid out by Saigon and that the U.S. should simply take control of anti-communist military policy, thereby necessitating a coup. The Americans became increasingly concerned with Saigon's reluctance to intensify the war effort, and bombing rebuff was regarded as a critical point. The government's plans to win over the NLF were never implemented to any degree before the government was deposed.|$|E
5|$|It {{would take}} almost two full years {{until the first}} French Constitution was signed on 3 September 1791, and it {{required}} another popular intervention to make it happen. Louis attempted <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> framework of his limited powers after the women's march but won little support, and he and the royal family remained virtual prisoners in the Tuileries. Desperate, he made his abortive flight to Varennes in June 1791. Attempting to escape and join up with royalist armies, the king was once again captured by a mixture of citizens and national guardsmen who hauled him back to Paris. Permanently disgraced, Louis was forced to accept a constitution more denuding of his kingship than any previously put forward. The spiral of decline in the king's fortunes culminated at the guillotine in 1793.|$|E
5|$|To gain {{political}} power in favor of prohibition legislation, a state Prohibition Party was formed in 1884; however, it {{was never able to}} effectively mobilize a significant force of voters within the state. Many temperance advocates continued <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> more established political parties. The liquor issue pitted wets and drys in stable uncompromising coalitions that formed a main theme of Hoosier politics into the 1930s. One legislative success occurred in 1895, when the state legislature passed the Nicholson law, a local option law authored by S. E. Nicholson, a Quaker minister who served in the state legislature and was a leader of the national Anti-Saloon League. The League became a {{political power}}house, mobilizing pietistic Protestant voters (that is, members of the major denominations except Lutherans and Episcopalians) to support dry legislation. The Nicholson law allowed voters in a city or township to file a remonstrance that would prevent an individual saloon owner from acquiring a liquor license. Additional legislative efforts to extend the Nicholson law and achieve statewide prohibition in Indiana would not occur until the early twentieth century. One of the leading supporters for the temperance movement in Indiana was Emma Barrett Molloy, who was {{an active member of the}} WCTU and lectured across the country to promote the ban of alcohol. Through her vocal activism in temperance and prohibition, Molloy also entered into the women's suffrage sphere as a strong supported for women's rights, particularly freedom of speech.|$|E

25|$|Within samizdat, several works {{focused on}} the {{possibility}} of a democratic political system. Democratic samizdat possessed a revolutionary nature because of its claim that a fundamental shift in political structure was necessary to reform the state, unlike socialists who hoped <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> same basic political framework to achieve change. Despite the revolutionary nature of the democratic samizdat authors, most democrats advocated moderate strategies for change. Most democrats believed in an evolutionary approach to achieving democracy in the USSR, and focused on advancing their cause along open, public routes, rather than underground routes.|$|E

25|$|The ship's owners {{changed her}} name from Loudoun to Imperial Eagle {{as an attempt}} to evade paying for trading {{licenses}} from the East India Company and the South Sea Company, which together held a monopoly on all British trade in the Far East and Pacific. The East India Company controlled British trade in Asia and the South Sea Company controlled the Pacific trade on the west coast of the Americas. British traders wanting <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> companies' domains were legally bound to acquire licenses. The cost was exorbitantly expensive. In the late 18th century a number of independent British traders, notably John Meares, sailed under false flags in order to evade paying for the required licenses. It was akin to flying a flag of convenience but due to the company monopolies, it was illegal for British traders to do so.|$|E

25|$|Other {{critics of}} the Mudawana point out that {{irrespective}} {{of the value of}} the reforms themselves, the process by which they were achieved is flawed, creates difficulties for their implementation, and can even be considered counter-productive to the process of democratization. It can be argued that while the reforms do represent a significant transformation of women’s rights, they also serve to solidify and expand the authority of the monarch as the defender or insurer of those rights. In the end, the civil society associations that lobbied for the reforms had <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> existing authoritarian system, appealing directly to the king for change rather than working through a democratic political process. Ultimately, the credit for the reforms' successful enactment has been given to the monarchy. Finally, some characterize the high degree of debate and deliberation over the issue as a dividing influence in the end; a representative from one Moroccan women’s organization described the women’s movement in Morocco not as a movement, but an uncoordinated group of different organizations.|$|E
25|$|Lou has a tempestuous {{relationship}} with her children-in-law Kathy and Arthur, blaming Kathy for Pete's first divorce (something Lou regards as unnatural, despite her fervent dislike of Pat), and showing displeasure at Arthur's unemployment; nothing he does is ever good enough for her daughter Pauline. In February 1985, she is furious to discover that Pauline is pregnant for the third time, her family already financially crippled by Arthur's long stint of unemployment. Lou isn't adverse to speaking her mind or scolding her family if she disapproves of their actions, but she soon comes to celebrate her grandson Martin's (Jon Peyton Price) birth – although she would have preferred him to be named Albert after her late husband. She is a strict traditionalist and moralist but she believes in strong family-values most of all, and will defend her family if any outsider dares to criticise them. She provides a warm shoulder to cry on when 16-year-old Michelle finds out she is pregnant in late 1985 and is supportive of her favourite grandchild, Ian, on his plans <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> catering trade rather than following in his father's footsteps in a more masculine occupation. Lou collapses in late 1985, prompting Dr Legg to send Lou into hospital for some tests and she is diagnosed with angina. The family have to make changes within the household to accommodate Lou's health problems, such as moving her bedroom downstairs, however, Lou doesn't take well to the changes.|$|E

These enormous weapons were designed to strike close by their target, to penetrate deeply into the earth, and to cause major structural damage by the shock waves transmitted through the ground.

500|$|The Great Northern Railway was {{incorporated}} into the newly formed LNER {{as a result of}} the 1923 Grouping. Gresley was appointed Chief Mechanical Engineer of the new company, which was the second largest of the [...] "Big Four" [...] railway companies in Britain. Realising the need for standardisation, Gresley adopted his GNR Pacific design as the standard express passenger locomotive for the LNER main line, designating it 'A1' within the LNER locomotive classification system. The choice was made after comparative trials with an equivalent North Eastern Railway Pacific, classified 'A2'. Between 1923 and 1925, 51 A1 locomotives were built; twenty by the North British Locomotive Company, and the remainder by Doncaster Works. However, Gresley's Pacifics had been designed <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> bounds of the Great Northern Railway, meaning maximum distances of less than 200 miles (322km). After the grouping, the locomotives were required to have a far greater operating range.|$|E
500|$|According to Michael Wolff, {{the family}} made the film without expecting a {{television}} series spin-off. Their agent believed the film would be lucrative and market research showed a positive reaction {{with a young}} audience. After the film was shown at the Hamptons International Film Festival, Nickelodeon bought it. Moreover, [...] "Albie Hecht had an independent production deal with Nickelodeon" [...] and believed the film suited the network and that a television show was feasible. Draper and Wolff did not want their children in show business {{at such a young}} age but agreed when Hecht's agent promised <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> boy's schedule, so that they would not miss school. This meant a summer shooting schedule in New York and short, 13-episode seasons. Nonetheless, after three seasons, despite the extremely high ratings, network executives urged the family to lengthen the 13 episode season to 60. Draper and Wolff refused, and as a result, the series was cancelled without any public announcement made by the network.|$|E
500|$|The Americans became {{increasingly}} {{worried about the}} growing chasm in the outlook towards the war, and on advice from his advisers, Johnson described neutralism as [...] "another name for a Communist takeover" [...] in a New Year's message to Minh. As Minh remained adamant about these policies, Roger Hilsman and Lodge, the main proponents of removing Diệm, began to lose confidence in the junta, joining the military establishment, who had opposed the coup against Diệm in the first place. In a January 21 meeting between Harkins, Lodge, Minh, Kim and Tho, the Americans mooted a plan to bomb North Vietnam and were explicitly rebuffed by Minh, who thought that such actions would result in escalation and be counterproductive, possibly inducing a Chinese land incursion akin to what had happened during the Korean War. The Australian historian Anne E. Blair identified this meeting as sealing Minh's political [...] "death warrant" [...] because when Lodge reported the meeting to Washington, the leading generals in the US military lobbied McNamara claiming {{that it was no}} longer feasible <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> parameters laid out by Saigon and that the US should simply take control of anti-communist military policy.|$|E
