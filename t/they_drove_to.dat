5|$|At about 04:30 on June 30, 1934, Hitler and {{his entourage}} flew into Munich. From the airport <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the Bavarian Interior Ministry, where they {{assembled}} the leaders of an SA rampage {{that had taken place}} in city streets the night before. Enraged, Hitler tore the epaulets off the shirt of Obergruppenführer August Schneidhuber, the chief of the Munich police, for failing to keep order in the city on the previous night. Hitler shouted at Schneidhuber and accused him of treachery. Schneidhuber was executed later that day. As the stormtroopers were hustled off to prison, Hitler assembled a large group of SS and regular police, and departed for the Hanselbauer Hotel in Bad Wiessee, where Ernst Röhm and his followers were staying.|$|E
5|$|The naval {{section of}} Alsos flew into Paris soon {{after it had}} been liberated in August 1944. They went down to Bordeaux to inspect the {{captured}} German destroyer Z39. After the Alsos Mission became convinced that the Germans had not developed an atomic bomb, the naval section became the Naval Technical Mission Europe. They were {{particularly interested in the}} work of Dr Hellmuth Walter in the development of submarines and rockets. Most of the targets that they were interested in lay in the British sector, so they worked closely with their English allies. In {{the last days of the}} war, the Naval Technical Mission was part of a 75-man task force, most of whom were from 30 Assault Unit, that made a dash for Kiel, entering the city far in advance of the Allied advance. The whole garrison of the city, some 150,000 men, surrendered to the task force. <b>They</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> Admiral Karl Dönitz's headquarters in Flensburg, where they saw but did not speak with him, as Dönitz was on his way to surrender. They spoke instead to Admiral Otto Backenköhler, and persuaded him to sign a release for German scientists, so men like Walter could freely discuss their work with the Allies. From April to December 1945, Mumma also served as assistant naval attaché.|$|E
25|$|In the {{overtime}} period, Tampa Bay won {{the coin}} toss. <b>They</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the Kansas City 15-yard line, and Matt Bryant {{won the game}} on a 34-yard field goal. The victory marked the largest comeback (from 21 points behind to win) in franchise history.|$|E
60|$|And so arguing, <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> up <b>to</b> {{the iron}} gates of Ullathorne Court.|$|R
60|$|Andrew {{gave him}} a {{grateful}} nod, {{and a few minutes}} later <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> up <b>to</b> Ghyllside.|$|R
60|$|Accordingly, {{after breakfast}} next day Mr. Hewson sent for a {{hackney-coach}} and <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> down <b>to</b> the docks.|$|R
25|$|Dallas {{was forced}} to a three and out on their opening drive, and the kick from quarterback Danny White (who also served as the team's punter) went just 26 yards before John Sciarra {{returned}} it to the Cowboys 42-yard line. One play later, Montgomery scored on a 42-yard rushing touchdown. The Eagles earned themselves chances to score on their next two drives. However, they were stopped both times and their special teams unit failed to capitalize. First, <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the Dallas 23-yard line, only to have Tony Franklin's field goal attempt blocked by Dallas cornerback Aaron Mitchell. Then <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the Cowboys 16-yard line, where Harvey Martin sacked Jaworski on third down and a high snap on the field goal try sailed right through Jaworski's hands.|$|E
25|$|AuCoin and {{his wife}} Sue campaigned in Wisconsin in 2004 for Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry for the last month of his presidential race. In 2008, <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> Ohio to spend the last five weeks of the {{election}} cycle campaigning for Democratic nominee Barack Obama.|$|E
25|$|In 1914, Swannell and {{his crew}} {{returned}} to the Omineca region and recommenced the survey work around the Finlay River. Swannell {{decided to take a}} new route home that fall and traveled up the Peace River to Hudson's Hope and Fort St. John, eventually arriving at Lesser Slave Lake where they took the steamer Northland Sun to Sawridge, Alberta and then <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the train which took them to Edmonton and then continued home by rail.|$|E
60|$|They {{laid the}} {{flowers on the}} fresh earth, even the white roses, and then <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> back <b>to</b> the city.|$|R
60|$|But the bewildered {{girls had}} no such confidence. <b>They</b> <b>drove</b> back <b>to</b> the farm to consult with Uncle John and Arthur.|$|R
6000|$|She {{mounted with}} a face elate, [...] Shut was the {{carriage}} door; <b>They</b> <b>drove</b> her <b>to</b> the madhouse gate, [...] And she was seen no more [...] .|$|R
25|$|In {{the second}} quarter, the Rams had three chances to score, but only {{managed to get}} points once. First, Mike Lansford missed a 41-yard field goal attempt (later matched by a 44-yard miss by Minnesota's Chuck Nelson). Then <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> a third and 1 on the Vikings 30 and were stopped for no gain on {{consecutive}} running plays. But just before halftime, Everett led the team 70 yards to cut the lead in half with his 3-yard touchdown pass to tight end Damone Johnson.|$|E
25|$|After forcing Jacksonville to punt on {{the opening}} drive of the second half, Brady led the Patriots 81-yards in 12 plays. On the 11th play, they nearly turned the ball over when tight end Benjamin Watson fumbled {{the ball on the}} Jaguars 5-yard line, but {{receiver}} André Davis recovered the ball, and Brady threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to David Givens on the next play. Then after forcing a punt, Brady threw a short pass to Watson who broke several tackles en route to a 63-yard score, increasing New England's lead to 21–3. After the kickoff, Leftwich led his team to the Patriots 32-yard line, but on the first play of the fourth quarter, defensive back Asante Samuel intercepted Leftwich's pass and took off for a 73-yard touchdown return, making the score 28–3. After that, Jacksonville mounted two more drives, but could not come away with any points. First <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the Patriots 8-yard line. But on third down and 2, McGinest sacked Leftwich for a 15-yard loss and Scobee missed a 41-yard field goal attempt on the next play. Then after forcing a punt, <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the Patriots 6-yard line, but ended up turning the ball over downs with five minutes left in the game.|$|E
25|$|In the fall, Polly's husband Dick {{moved back}} home. His parents {{supplied}} a small living allowance and Dick, Polly, {{and the two}} children moved into a three-story tenement building. Crosby lived with his father while Dick continued his studies at Harvard. While Dick worked at the bank, Harry Crosby sent crates of flowers from his mother's garden to Polly's apartment and brought over toys for the children. <b>They</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the shore together. Dick volunteered to join the fire department and persuaded the fire chief to wire a fire alarm bell to his home, so he could turn out at any hour. The fire chief soon let Dick go, and Dick retreated into drink again.|$|E
60|$|A large bottle {{was next}} filled with elder flower water. The trap was brought around, and <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> back <b>to</b> Bithoor. Rabda was {{punctual}} to her appointment.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>drove</b> up <b>to</b> London {{almost in}} silence. It was nearly seven o'clock when John swung the little car in Pont Street. It was still raining softly.|$|R
6000|$|Both knew Cedarville [...] "like a book," [...] as Tom {{expressed}} it, {{having been}} there {{so many times}} before. <b>They</b> <b>drove</b> straight <b>to</b> the largest confectionery in the village.|$|R
25|$|The {{start of}} the fourth quarter saw the Seahawks blow another scoring chance when Raiders {{defensive}} back Vann McElroy intercepted a pass from Zorn after the team had recovered Plunkett's fumbled pitch to Allen on the Los Angeles 25-yard line. Then {{the next time they}} had the ball, <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the LA 40-yard line, only to see Greg Townsend sack Zorn for a 23-yard loss on fourth down and 4. After the turnover on downs, Bahr kicked a 35-yard field goal to give the Raiders an insurmountable 30–7 lead with 3:57 left. At this point, all that remained was Zorn's meaningless touchdown pass to tight end Charle Young, making the final score 30–14.|$|E
25|$|The Grand Dukes {{were loaded}} into a truck that already held four common criminals and six Red Guardsmen. At 1:20 am on 28 January, {{they left the}} prison. They drove towards the river by the Field of Mars, where the truck stalled. While the driver was trying to restart it, one of the convicts tried to run and {{was shot in the}} back as he fled. The truck {{eventually}} began running again, and <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the Peter and Paul Fortress. The prisoners were roughly pushed from the truck into the Trubetskoy bastion. They were told to remove their shirts and coats, {{despite the fact that it}} was almost 20 degrees below zero. By then they had no doubt what was about to occur and the Grand Dukes embraced each other for the last time.|$|E
25|$|Both teams {{struggled}} {{in the heavy}} snow storm during the first half, combining for {{the same number of}} punts as first downs (11) and converting only one of 13 third downs. However, Raiders quarterback Rich Gannon was efficient, completing 10 of 14 passes for 87 yards. The closest either team would come to scoring in the first quarter would be New England's drive to the Oakland 31-yard line, which ended when Brady threw an incomplete pass on fourth and 2. With 1:12 left in the quarter, a 15-yard fair catch interference penalty against Patriots defensive back Je'Rod Cherry at the end of Ken Walter's 39-yard punt gave Oakland a first down at midfield, where <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> a 7-0 lead on Gannon's 13-yard touchdown pass to James Jett. A few plays later, Raiders defensive back Johnnie Harris intercepted a pass from Brady on the Patriots 41-yard line, but New England's defense managed to force a punt, which would be the final result of every following drive {{until the end of the}} half.|$|E
6000|$|... 'How {{much are}} they ahead?' shouted Wardle, as <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> up <b>to</b> {{the door of}} the Blue Lion, round which a little crowd had collected, late as it was.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, perhaps," [...] he replied, in {{unabated}} perplexity. He bade them serve God, and {{let them}} out into the snowy night, through which <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> back <b>to</b> the hotel.|$|R
60|$|After that <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> on <b>to</b> Market Saffron, and {{got there}} {{in time for}} lunch, and after lunch Mr. Direck {{explored}} {{the church and the}} churchyard and the parish register....|$|R
25|$|At 6:00 PM on July 23, Forbes and Beach {{drove to}} the Afro Culture Shop and Bookstore at 11105 Superior Avenue to see Evans. Not finding him there, <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the Evans' {{apartment}} at 12312 Auburndale Avenue and were {{surprised to discover that}} the Cleveland Police had, in fact, established a stationary surveillance around Evans' home. One unmarked car with white officers sat on Lakeview Avenue between Moulton and Auburndale, and another with white officers sat at the intersection of Auburndale and E. 124th Street. At 7:50 PM, Forbes and Beach arrived at Evans' home. They talked with him for 15 minutes, during which time Evans expressed his anxiety about the police and his concern {{that he was going to}} be harassed again. Forbes attempted to have the stationary surveillance removed, but was advised by the city's Safety Director, James McManamon, to speak with Mayor Stokes. Forbes reached Stokes, but Stokes was interrupted by another call and asked Forbes to call back in 15 minutes. During this time, Forbes {{drove to the}} home of Harllel Jones, an Evans associate. While speaking with Jones, they learned that the shootout had begun.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of July 9, Mohamed Atta rented a silver Hyundai Accent, which he booked from SIXT Rent-A-Car for July 9 to 16, and later {{extended}} to the 19th. He drove east out of Madrid towards the Mediterranean beach area of Tarragona. On the way, Atta stopped in Reus to pick up Ramzi bin al-Shibh at the airport. <b>They</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> Cambrils, where they spent {{a night at the}} Hotel Monica. They checked out the next morning, and spent the next few days at an unknown location in Tarragona. The absence of other hotel stays, signed receipts or credit card stubs has led investigators to believe that the men may have met in a safe house provided by other al-Qaeda operatives in Spain. There, Atta and bin al-Shibh held a meeting to complete the planning of the attacks. Several clues have been found to link their stay in Spain to Syrian-born Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas (Abu Dahdah), and Amer el Azizi, a Moroccan in Spain. They may have helped arrange and host the meeting in Tarragona. Yosri Fouda, who interviewed bin al-Shibh and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM) before the arrest, believes that Said Bahaji and KSM may have also been present at the meeting. Spanish investigators have said that Marwan al-Shehhi and two others later joined the meeting. Bin al-Shibh would not discuss this meeting with Fouda.|$|E
25|$|The committal {{hearing to}} {{determine}} if there was sufficient evidence for Einem to stand trial for murder began on 20 February 1984. Faced with irrefutable evidence from prosecutors that Kelvin had been in his company, Einem suddenly changed his story to answer that evidence and admitted that he had been in contact with Richard Kelvin on the night of 5 June 1983. Einem said that he was driving along O'Connell Street in North Adelaide looking for a parking spot in order to buy some dinner. While looking for a parking spot in a side street, Einem said that he had nearly run over Kelvin as he jogged in from his side. Einem stated he thought Kelvin had bisexual tendencies and said {{that the two of them}} then had a conversation about problems Kelvin had been having at school, and Kelvin willingly got into the car and <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> Einem's home. This answered the question of how fibres from Einem's carpet had got onto Kelvin's clothes. To answer evidence about how fibres from Einem's bed had come to be on Kelvin's clothes, Einem stated that the two of them had sat on his bed and played with the large harp which he kept in his bedroom. Police previously did see this harp in his room when they seized the drugs. Finally, to answer evidence about how fibres from Einem's cardigan had got onto Kelvin, Einem stated that he had put his arm around Kelvin and hugged him because Kelvin was upset about how his peers had been bullying him at school. With all the fibres being accounted for with his new story, Einem concluded his statement by saying that Kelvin had stayed for two hours before Einem dropped him off in the Adelaide CBD near the Royal Adelaide Hospital and gave Kelvin $20 to pay for a taxi home.|$|E
50|$|Sandy {{drove his}} 2004 Mazda to the location, and met Fox first, near Emmons Avenue. <b>They</b> then <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> Howard Beach, where Fortunato, Shurov, and Timmons were waiting.|$|R
60|$|When Ashton {{was reached}} it was dark, and <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> around <b>to</b> the hotel. Songbird and Minnie had been dining, {{and the student}} asked Mr. Sanderson and Sam to have something.|$|R

500|$|The 1938 Northwestern game {{ended in}} a {{scoreless}} tie. Heikkinen led a goal-line stand that preserved the tie. Northwestern reached the 11-yard line on a 51-yard pass play. A penalty took {{the ball to the}} six-yard line. On first down, <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the five, then to the two, and then to the one-yard line for a first down. On first down with a yard to go, Heikkinen stopped Northwestern a foot short of the goal line. Heikkinen called time out and encouraged the players when the ball was on the one-foot line, and the Michigan team kept the Wildcats from the end zone in an impressive goal-line stand. In the Ohio State game, his former coach Anderson said: “He was the fifth man in the Ohio backfield. He pulled out of the line to lead the Michigan interference, blocked, went down under punts, smeared Ohio running plays and what not!” ...|$|E
500|$|Fine {{weather was}} {{forecast}} for 4 June, with perhaps a morning haze (between 15 May and 9 June {{the weather was}} fair or fine except for , when it was very bad). Zero Day was fixed for 7 June, with zero hour at [...] when {{it was expected that}} a man could be seen from the west at [...] There was a thunderstorm in the evening of 6 June but by midnight the sky had cleared and at [...] British aircraft cruised over the German lines to camouflage the sound of tanks as <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> their starting points.

After the explosions, the British artillery began to fire at maximum rate. A creeping barrage in three belts [...] deep began and counter-battery groups bombarded all known German artillery positions with gas shell. The nine attacking divisions and the three in reserve began their advance as the German artillery reply came scattered and late, falling on British assembly trenches after they had been vacated.|$|E
2500|$|... 17 January: Seven IRA volunteers, jailed in {{the prison}} ship HMS Maidstone, escaped {{successfully}} through a porthole on the side away from the dock. They swam to the dockside and hijacked a bus which <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the Markets area. The escapees later held a press conference.|$|E
60|$|Haney, {{almost as}} eager as she, consented, {{and on the}} third day <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> up <b>to</b> the door, {{dismissed}} their hired coachman, and stepped inside the gate--master and mistress of an American chateau.|$|R
