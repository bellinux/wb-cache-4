50|$|Padstow {{railway station}} {{is on the}} Sydney Trains Airport, Inner West & South Line, west of Riverwood and east of Revesby. There are several bus routes that pass through Padstow, all {{operated}} by Transdev NSW. These services developed from routes established by McVicar's Bus Services, which was dissolved in 1978. The 927 <b>travels</b> <b>from</b> One Tree Point (the easternmost tip of Padstow Heights) to Padstow. The 962 <b>travels</b> <b>from</b> Bankstown to Miranda through Padstow, Illawong, Menai and Sutherland. The S5 <b>travels</b> <b>from</b> Milperra to Padstow. Two Metrobus routes travel through Padstow: M91 and M92. M91 <b>travels</b> <b>from</b> Parramatta to Hurstville, via Granville, Chester Hill, Bankstown, Padstow and Peakhurst.

Travel between worlds allows for puzzles in A Link to the Past that exploit structural differences between the Light and Dark Worlds, as Link may travel to otherwise inaccessible areas in one world by warping from parallel but accessible locations in the other world.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{plans for}} the expressway dating back to 1969 were for it to <b>travel</b> <b>from</b> current County Road 22, heading west along {{the southern edge of}} Belle River and Tecumseh, meeting up with the current two-lane freeway alignment (Pike Creek Bypass) just east of Puce, as well as having the west end continue south through Lasalle to north of Amherstburg.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method is}} to use the {{aberration}} of light, discovered and explained by James Bradley in the 18th century. This effect results from the vector addition of the velocity of light arriving from a distant source (such as a star) and the velocity of its observer (see diagram on the right). A moving observer thus sees the light coming from a slightly different direction and consequently sees the source at a position shifted from its original position. Since the direction of the Earth's velocity changes continuously as the Earth orbits the Sun, this effect causes the apparent position of stars to move around. From the angular difference in the position of stars (maximally 20.5 arcseconds) it is possible to express the speed of light in terms of the Earth's velocity around the Sun, which with the known length of a year can be converted to the time needed to <b>travel</b> <b>from</b> the Sun to the Earth. In 1729, Bradley used this method to derive that light travelled 10,210 times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is 10,066 times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8minutes 12seconds to <b>travel</b> <b>from</b> the Sun to the Earth.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} two tower complexes, there is a {{reception}} office, administrative block, monastic quarters, meditation halls and a kitchen complex where lay supporters prepare meals for the monks and visitors. The monastic quarters and meditation hall are not open to laypeople and can provide accommodation for hundreds of monks. This large capacity is often utilised during the Rains Retreat. This retreat commemorates events during {{the life of the}} Buddha, when the rainy season came between the full moons of the fourth and seventh lunar months. As a result, monks of the time stayed in one place to practice rather than <b>travel</b> <b>from</b> place to place.|$|E
5|$|BP in its 2017 Energy Outlook {{forecasts}} {{that the}} number of plug-in electric cars will rise from 1.2 million in 2015 to around 100 million by 2035 representing about 5.5% of the global fleet of passenger cars. Around 25% of these plug-in electric vehicles will be plug-in hybrids and 75% will be pure battery electric cars. The oil company also projects that automotive fuel demand for use in cars will continue to rise, despite efficiency improvements in conventional internal combustion engines and increased plug-in car adoption due to growth in demand for car <b>travel</b> <b>from</b> the growing middle class in emerging economies.|$|E
5|$|Because {{observations}} of Titan were considered vital, the trajectory chosen for Voyager 1 was designed around the optimum Titan flyby, which took it below {{the south pole}} of Saturn {{and out of the}} plane of the ecliptic, ending its planetary science mission. Had Voyager 1 failed or been unable to observe Titan, Voyager 2s trajectory would have been altered to incorporate the Titan flyby, precluding any visit to Uranus and Neptune. The trajectory Voyager 1 was launched into would not have allowed it to continue on to Uranus and Neptune, but could have been altered to avoid a Titan flyby and <b>travel</b> <b>from</b> Saturn to Pluto, arriving in 1986.|$|E

5|$|Certain quantum effects {{appear to}} be {{transmitted}} instantaneously and therefore faster than c, as in the EPR paradox. An example involves the quantum states of two particles that can be entangled. Until either of the particles is observed, they exist in a superposition of two quantum states. If the particles are separated and one particle's quantum state is observed, the other particle's quantum state is determined instantaneously (i.e., faster than light could <b>travel</b> <b>from</b> one particle to the other). However, {{it is impossible to}} control which quantum state the first particle will take on when it is observed, so information cannot be transmitted in this manner.|$|E
