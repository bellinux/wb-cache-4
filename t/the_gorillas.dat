5|$|Rwanda's {{service sector}} {{suffered}} during the late-2000s recession as bank lending, foreign aid projects and investment were reduced. The sector rebounded in 2010, becoming the country's largest sector by economic output and contributing 43.6% of the country's GDP. Key tertiary contributors include banking and finance, wholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurants, transport, storage, communication, insurance, real estate, business services and public administration including education and health. Tourism {{is one of}} the fastest-growing economic resources and became the country's leading foreign exchange earner in 2007. In spite of the genocide's legacy, the country is increasingly perceived internationally as a safe destination. The number of tourist arrivals in 2013 was 864,000 people, up from 504,000 in 2010. Revenue from tourism was US$303million in 2014, up from just US$62million in 2000. The largest contributor to this revenue was mountain gorilla tracking, in the Volcanoes National Park; Rwanda is one of only two countries in which mountain gorillas can be visited safely; <b>the</b> <b>gorillas</b> attract thousands of visitors per year, who are prepared to pay high prices for permits. Other attractions include Nyungwe Forest, home to chimpanzees, Ruwenzori colobus and other primates, the resorts of Lake Kivu, and Akagera, a small savanna reserve in the east of the country.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} a study {{examining}} the ability of western lowland gorillas to give to and exchange with humans. This involved humans holding objects such as fruit, leaves or peanuts in one hand. Once <b>the</b> <b>gorillas</b> had given twigs to the humans, they would receive one of these objects. If <b>the</b> <b>gorillas</b> did not give them a twig, they would not get their desired object. <b>The</b> <b>gorillas</b> were shown to quickly learn about receiving rewards as mistakes made by <b>the</b> <b>gorillas</b> {{in the beginning of}} the experiments gradually decreased.|$|E

5000|$|The monkey {{runs to the}} zoo, {{where he}} tells a gorilla about what {{happened}} (the only intelligible words being Bugs' line [...] "What's up doc? What's up doc? What's up doc?"). The monkey dramatizes being kicked by Bugs, which sends <b>the</b> <b>gorilla</b> in a frenzy. <b>The</b> <b>gorilla</b> breaks out of his cage and confronts Bugs. Bugs tells <b>the</b> <b>gorilla</b> that he's working, but <b>the</b> <b>gorilla</b> threatens him by punching {{a hole in the}} wall. Bugs is able to outwit <b>the</b> <b>gorilla</b> by asking <b>the</b> <b>gorilla</b> if he can inflate himself with his finger, causing <b>the</b> <b>gorilla</b> to literally inflate. Bugs tells the gorlla that what he's doing is too immature: [...] "You're a big boy now. Take your finger out of your mouth!". <b>The</b> <b>gorilla</b> obliges, but falls many stories down from the apartment building. At one point, <b>the</b> <b>gorilla</b> gets tricked into unsuccessfully attempting to bounce off, only to crash into, the shaded entryway, falling through the basement and comes up a lift, holding a newspaper and with his arm through a subway window. Bugs, acting as a conductor, orders <b>the</b> <b>gorilla</b> to [...] "push in, plenty of room {{in the center of the}} car!", pausing to tell the audience [...] "I used to work on the shuttle from Times Square to Grand Central", before pushing <b>the</b> <b>gorilla</b> back underground again where the train crashes into <b>the</b> <b>gorilla</b> off screen.

50|$|In {{doubt of}} what he should do, Oswald puts a small wooden stave between his neck and shoulder, and {{challenges}} <b>the</b> <b>gorilla</b> to knock it off. <b>The</b> <b>gorilla</b> throws a right hook and Oswald is sent bouncing off the walls, but the stave remained in place. <b>The</b> <b>gorilla</b> then flicks <b>the</b> tiny piece of wood off with its finger which worked. Little did <b>the</b> <b>gorilla</b> know that <b>the</b> flicked stave starts knocking down a number of nearby ornaments. This domino effect lead to toppling a statue holding a torch, causing it to light the fuse of a cannon which is aimed at <b>the</b> <b>gorilla.</b> Upon being struck by <b>the</b> cannonball, <b>the</b> <b>gorilla</b> was reduced to bones.

25|$|Unlike <b>the</b> <b>gorillas</b> {{from the}} Congo {{side of the}} Virungas, the Karisoke area gorillas had never been {{partially}} habituated by Schaller's study; they knew humans only as poachers, and it took longer for Fossey {{to be able to}} study the Karisoke gorillas at a close distance.|$|E

25|$|In Congo, with a {{civil war}} ongoing, Dian Fossey, who was researching gorillas, was captured.

25|$|Moyo (Neil Patrick Harris) - Another gorilla in Tarzan's family. He once {{believed}} Tarzan cared {{more about}} Jane than the family. When Hista, an enormous red python, attacked while Tarzan was with Jane, Moyo managed to chase Hista {{away for the}} time being. When Tarzan returned, he boasted about this one time accomplishment, claimed that Tarzan was too busy being with Jane to protect the family, and challenged Tarzan for leadership of <b>the</b> <b>gorillas.</b> Moyo defeated Tarzan, though only because Tarzan had saved Moyo from an imminent death from being impaled on sharp spikes. Moyo led the family away and, by an error of judgment, they walked into a tar pit. After some conflict, Moyo and Tarzan cooperated to rescue the family and lure Hista into the tar pit, where the great snake became stuck and sank, killing him and forever ending the python's reign of terror. Moyo reconciled with Tarzan, finally seeing that Jane was part of their family, and stepped down as leader. He promised to wait until {{he was ready to}} try to become leader again. Despite his arrogance and stubbornness, when the elephants and gorillas engage in jungle warfare, Moyo plays a big part in helping Tarzan lead <b>the</b> <b>gorillas</b> to victory. Just as <b>the</b> <b>gorillas</b> are about to triumph, a fire breaks out, and Moyo is the first gorilla to follow Tarzan's lead in putting out the fire.|$|E
25|$|Tublat (Keith David) – A rogue ape and {{a former}} member of Tarzan's gorilla family. He {{challenged}} Kerchak for leadership but he was defeated and cast out. He is considered dangerous by all <b>the</b> <b>gorillas</b> due to his aggressive and sociopathic behavior. He is based on Kala's husband (and Tarzan's foster father) in the original Tarzan novel. His personality is also very much like the original Kerchak or Terkoz from the novel. Conversely, Kerchak's personality in the 1999 film is just like Tublat's in the original novel. He once took over another gorilla family that Gobu belonged to, but inspired by Tarzan the family overthrew him and Gobu replaced him. He often calls Tarzan a hairless runt. He has four toes on his right foot (it is possible he lost one in a fight), and this is one way to tell he is in the area. In the series, he plots to dispose of Tarzan so that he can take over the gorilla pack for himself and makes no secret of his hatred against Tarzan, believing him to be unworthy of leading the gorilla family (despite Tarzan's actual success as a leader of <b>the</b> <b>gorillas).</b>|$|E

25|$|Western lowland gorillas {{primarily}} live in rain forests, swamp forest, brush, secondary vegetation, {{clearing and}} forest edges, abandoned farming fields and riverine forests. They live in {{primary and secondary}} lowland tropical forests that have elevations that extend from sea level up to 1,300 meters. The average amount of rainfall in the areas where western lowland gorillas typically reside is about 1,500 millimetres a year with the greatest rainfall between the months of August and November. Western lowland gorillas are not typically observed {{in areas that are}} close to human settlements and villages. They have been known to avoid areas with roads and farms that show signs of human activity. These gorillas favor areas where edible plants are more copious. Swamp forests are now considered important feeding areas and habitats for the western lowland gorilla. These areas support <b>the</b> <b>gorillas</b> in both the wet and the dry season of the forest. The forests of the Republic of Congo are currently considered to host the majority of the western lowland gorilla population. The forests of the Republic of Congo serve as protection to <b>the</b> <b>gorillas</b> with the isolation of the large swampy forest areas.|$|E
