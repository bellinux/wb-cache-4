25|$|Printer ink {{cartridges}} can be reused. They are sorted by brand and model, to be refilled or resold {{back to the}} manufacturers. The companies then refill the ink reservoir to resell to consumers. <b>Toner</b> <b>cartridges</b> are recycled {{the same way as}} {{ink cartridges}}, using toner instead of ink. This method is highly efficient as there is no energy spent on melting and recreating the cartridges.|$|E
25|$|Zhuhai {{manufactured}} and supplied 70% of the world's ribbons, 60% of the world's aftermarket inkjet cartridges and 20% of the world's third-party laser <b>toner</b> <b>cartridges.</b> Their {{combined sales}} were {{worth more than}} 1.3 billion US dollars or 10% of all the sales in the world.

Prior to 2008, the only cartridges {{that could be}} recycled were HP, Kodak, and Dell, and customers were given a three dollar coupon for the store, with a maximum number of coupons that could be given, or redeemed, at any time being 25. Starting in 2008 and continuing to the present, one's ink recycling goes on the customer's Staples Rewards.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. With {{the fast}} growing of {{printing}} supplies industry in Shanghai, {{it creates a}} large waste stream of obsolete printing supplies and causes great pressure on the environment. The information of remanufacturing printing supplies in Shanghai is gathered and waste stream is analyzed. As {{a case study of}} original <b>toner</b> <b>cartridge</b> and remanufacturing <b>toner</b> <b>cartridge</b> is compared in the context of life cycle methodology. The results show raw materials, energy consumption and pollution emission of the remanufactured <b>toner</b> <b>cartridge</b> are less than these of original <b>toner</b> <b>cartridge.</b> Environmental loads equitant including global warming potential, acidification potential, photo-oxidant formation potential, solid waste and fume from remanufacturing <b>toner</b> <b>cartridge</b> are cut 3. 61 %, 3. 84 %, 15. 24 % and 22. 52 % comparing to original <b>toner</b> <b>cartridge.</b> Its significance is that remanufacturing printing supplies can be more profitable and less harmful to the external environment than conventional manufacturing process. It also discusses strategies for lowering the environmental burden to promote the remanufacturing printing supplies in Shanghai...|$|R

2500|$|The most {{involved}} reuse {{organizations are}} [...] "repair and overhaul" [...] industries which take valuable parts, such as engine blocks, office furniture, <b>toner</b> <b>cartridges,</b> single-use cameras, aircraft hulls, and cathode ray tubes (CRTs) and refurbish {{them in a}} factory environment {{in order to meet}} the same/similar specifications as new products. Xerox (copy machines), and Cummins Engine are examples of refurbishing factories in the USA. Rolls Royce has a very large aircraft remanufacturing factory in Singapore; Caterpillar recently announced the opening of a tractor refurbishing plant in China. Some factories operate in competition with the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). When the refurbished item is resold under a new label (used monitor CRTs made into TVs, or cameras resold under a new label) this has been found legal by most courts.|$|E

50|$|Low-end to {{mid-range}} {{laser printers}} typically contain two consumable parts: the toner cartridge itself (which has a typical life of 2,000 pages) and the drum unit (a typical life of 40,000 pages). Some <b>toner</b> <b>cartridges</b> incorporate the drum {{unit in the}} design and therefore replacing the toner means replacing the drum unit every single time, although some consider this type unessential and therefore not cost-effective. <b>Toner</b> <b>Cartridges</b> are similar to ink cartridges, which are used in inkjet printing.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} fairly compare {{operating}} expenses of printers {{with a relatively}} small ink cartridge to printers with a larger, more expensive <b>toner</b> <b>cartridge</b> that typically holds more toner and so prints more pages before the cartridge needs to be replaced, many people prefer to estimate operating expenses in terms of cost per page (CPP).|$|R
50|$|Toner is {{a powder}} used in laser {{printers}} and photocopiers {{to form the}} printed text and images on the paper, in general with a <b>toner</b> <b>cartridge.</b> In its early form it was a mix of carbon powder and iron oxide.
