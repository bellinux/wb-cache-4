5|$|The {{earliest}} {{terms for}} classifying individuals of low intelligence were medical or legal terms {{that preceded the}} development of IQ testing. The legal system recognized a concept of some individuals being so cognitively impaired {{that they were not}} responsible for criminal behavior. Medical doctors sometimes encountered adult patients who could not live independently, being unable <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own daily living needs. Various terms were used to attempt to classify individuals with varying degrees of intellectual disability. Many of the earliest terms are now considered very offensive.|$|E

5|$|As Peter and Lois {{are having}} sex, she yells out George Clooney's name, so Peter realizes {{that she is}} imagining him as Clooney to {{maintain}} her libido. Lois and Peter decide {{to take a second}} honeymoon to enliven their marriage, and leave their anthropomorphic dog Brian <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> children Stewie, Chris, and Meg. Brian is unable to control the children, but Stewie offers to help (in exchange for Brian changing his diaper) and together they manage the home. The pair chaperone a dance at Chris's school, during which a school staff member catches Chris in the boys' restroom with vodka that belongs to his classmate Jake Tucker. Although Brian and Stewie punish Chris by grounding him, they try to clear his name. Jake's father Tom refuses to believe Brian and Stewie, so they resort to planting cocaine in Jake's locker, and Jake is sentenced to community service.|$|E

25|$|S.O.Y. Keita and A.J. Boyce, {{authors of}} Variation in Porotic Hyperostosis in the Royal Cemetery Complex at Abydos, Upper Egypt: A Social Interpretation, {{examined}} forty-four skulls from the funerary complex of King Djer {{and discovered that}} those buried outside the tomb enjoyed better health {{than those in the}} actual tomb. This can be interpreted in two ways. First, those buried outside the tomb were believed to have enjoyed better health because they were wealthier, and consequently, had better nutritional standards. The second is that those buried inside the royal tomb could afford <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> illness-ridden children. Whichever explanation is correct, there is such a statistically significant difference that these two groups most likely did not share the same social status.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} types of stories among many {{indigenous}} communities. Communication in Indigenous American communities is rich with stories, myths, philosophies and narratives that serve {{as a means to}} exchange information. These stories may be used for coming of age themes, core values, morality, literacy and history. Very often, the stories are used to instruct and teach children about cultural values and lessons. The meaning within the stories is not always explicit, and children are expected to make their own meaning of the stories. In the Lakota Tribe of North America, for example, young girls are often told the story of the White Buffalo Calf Woman, who is a spiritual figure that protects young girls from the whims of men. In the Odawa Tribe, young boys are often told {{the story of a young}} man who never took care of his body, and as a result, his feet fail to run when he tries to escape predators. This story serves as an indirect means of encouraging the young boys <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> bodies.|$|E

25|$|Cemeteries for {{deceased}} {{prisoners were}} gradually opened near the camps. It {{was a point}} of honour for the survivors <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> comrades’ final resting places. Most often, each nationality had its own reserved patch. In certain camps, such as Gardelegen, veritable monuments were erected. Roger Pelletier motivated his comrades: “Doesn’t it fall to us, who have known them, {{to all of us}} here who are their great family, to raise, in the cemetery where they rest, a monument of the French soul that, spreading above them like an aegis, will be above our dead, when we have left, as a memory and a goodbye?” Wilhelm Doegen estimates the number of dead in the camps at 118,159 but serious doubts surround this number, notably because Doegen failed to take certain diseases into account. Also according to Doegen, Russia suffered the heaviest losses (perhaps explained by the poorer nutrition of Russians, most of whom did not receive packages from their families) with a little over 70,000 dead, followed by France with 17,069 deaths, Romania with 12,512, and then Italy and the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Although {{many women}} were doing jobs that men had {{previously}} {{done during the}} war, there were still pay distinctions between the two sexes. Equal pay was rarely achieved as employers wanted to avoid labour costs. Skilled work was often broken down into smaller tasks and labelled skilled or semi-skilled and then paid according to women's pay rates. Women who were judged to be doing ‘men’s work’ were paid more than women who {{were thought to be}} doing ‘women’s work’ and the employers' definition of this varied regionally. Women were receiving closer wages to their male counterparts; however despite the government's expressed intentions, women continued to be paid less than men for equivalent work and were segregated in terms of job description, status, and the hours they put in. In 1940 Ernest Bevin persuaded engineering employers and unions to give women equal pay to men since they were taking on the same tasks that men previously had; this became the Extended Employment of Women Agreement. Generally, pay increases depended on the industry; industries that were dominated by women before the war, like textiles and clothing, saw no changes in pay. However the gap between male and female earnings narrowed by 20-24% in metals, engineering and vehicle building and by 10-13% in chemicals, which were all deemed important to the war effort. Overtime hours also differed, with women getting 2–3 hours and men 9-10 a week. Women’s hours were still regulated because of their responsibilities <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> family and household.|$|E

[...] At the same time, currents of doubt ran through North Carolina, as Loyalists attempted to hinder enlistment of Patriots by spreading rumors about the imminent demise of the Patriot army in the north, and disease that was allegedly ravaging that force.|$|E

He opposed the closing of an elementary school; even though most gay people in the Castro did not have children, Milk saw his neighborhood having the potential to welcome everyone. He told his aides to concentrate on fixing potholes and boasted that 50 new stop signs had been installed in District 5. Responding to city residents' largest complaint about living in San Francisco—dog feces—Milk made it a priority to enact the ordinance requiring dog owners <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> pets' droppings.

500|$|Strang {{refused to}} appoint a successor, telling his apostles <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> {{families}} as best they could, and await divine instruction. [...] While his supporters endeavored to keep his church alive, Strang's unique dogma requiring his successor to be ordained by angels handicapped his church in its {{search for a new}} prophet. [...] Lorenzo Dow Hickey, the last of Strang's apostles, emerged as an ad-hoc leader until his death in 1897, followed by Wingfield W. Watson, a High Priest in Strang's organization (until he died in 1922). [...] Neither of these men ever claimed Strang's office or authority, however. [...] Left without a prophet to guide them, most of Strang's members (including all of his wives) departed his church in the years after his murder. [...] Most later joined the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which was established in 1860. [...] A few, however, continue to carry on Strang's mission as best they can, while awaiting a new successor to their fallen founder.|$|E
500|$|The basic social {{unit was}} the nuclear family, {{consisting}} {{of parents and}} their children, which had to fit in a dwelling area of several to 25 square meters. The [...] "big family," [...] a patriarchal, multi-generational group of related families with {{the meaning of a}} kin or clan, was of declining importance during this period. A larger group was needed in the past (5th–7th centuries) for forest clearing and burning undertakings, when farming communities had to shift from location to location; in the 8th-century phase of agriculture, a family was sufficient <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> arable land. A concept of agricultural land ownership was gradually developing, at this point a family, not individual prerogative. Several or more clan territories were grouped into a neighborhood association, or [...] "opole", which established a rudimentary self-government. Such a community was the owner of forested land, pastures, bodies of water and within it took place the first organization around common projects and the related development of political power. A big and resourceful opole could become, by extending its possessions, a proto-state entity vaguely referred to as a tribe. The tribe was the top level of this structure. It would contain several opoles and control a region of up to about 1500 square kilometers, where internal relationships were arbitrated and external defense organized.|$|E
