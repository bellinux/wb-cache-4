No shelter, though it hailed. The sheds were for the bricks. Unless, indeed, according to the phrase, each man was a [...] "brick," [...] which, in sober scripture, was the case; brick is no bad name for any son of Adam; Eden was but a brickyard; what is a mortal but a few luckless shovelfuls of clay, moulded in a mould, laid out on a sheet to dry, and ere long quickened into his queer caprices by the sun? Are not men built into communities just like bricks into a wall? Consider {{the great wall of}} China: ponder the great populace of Pekin. As man serves bricks, so God him, building him up by billions into edifices of his purposes. Man attains not to the nobility of a brick, unless taken in the aggregate. Yet is <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in brick, whether quick or dead; which, for the last, we now shall see.|$|E
6000|$|Answ. (1.) That scripture {{quoted in}} John 3. [...] "Light is {{come into the}} world," [...] &c., is not meant of that light, or conscience, that every man hath; but the Man Christ Jesus is {{speaking}} there of himself, as God-man, come into the world, born of the Virgin, if thou compare verses 19-21 with 14-18 of the same chapter, it is clear, for they all do speak of the same thing; namely, the Son of Mary. And again, saith he, [...] "I am {{the light of the}} world." [...] Now the man Christ, though he was then in the world, and walked {{up and down in the}} same, yet he was not within any man in the world as man, (though he calls himself the light thereof) though he was in some; I say, in some, as God by his Spirit. Now the light, which was the Man Christ, was the very same, whether loved by some, or hated by others; but if you conclude every man hath Christ, or that light spoken of there (John 3), within him; that I deny, having proved the contrary. But (2.) Whether is <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in the light? Answ. There are more lights than one, there is a light that may be suspected to be darkness, where he saith, [...] "If the light that is in thee be darkness," [...] &c. Again, there is the light of the law (Prov 6:23). Again, conscience also will convince of sin. Now there is none of these that can save a sinner from the evil of his ways. Take the best of them, which is the righteous law of God, that cannot. For had there been a law given, which might have given life, then verily righteousness had come by the law: But if you conclude that righteousness, or everlasting life cometh by the law, you must conclude this again; that Christ did die in vain (Gal 2:21). So then these things being not able to save the soul, the next thing is, the Son of God, the Son of righteousness arising with healing under his wings; he is also a light, and indeed the saving light, for surpassing all the other mentioned.|$|E

5000|$|... "Facts and Fears: Societal Perception of Risk" [...] - There is {{statistical}} data for many hazards {{that people can}} perceive such as smoking, car wrecks, etc. But without interpretation of the statistics they are just numbers {{and they have to}} be given relevance in their respective context. Slovic looks at the psychology of risk assessment when managing hazards. He says that experts as general publics are needed in the assessment process and “that understanding public perceptions is crucial to effective decision making”. Through his study he looked at how people view as a perceived risk and what determines risk perception. By the end of his research he concluded that “perceived risk is quantifiable and predictable”. Not only is <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in perception between experts and public but also the people within the public differ as well. He found that when there is a higher perceived risk it causes higher desired reduction of that risk.|$|E

[...] The phrase stuck with me; you might say it festered in my mind; it agitated questions: Why do we all want to feel our feelings, so generally that people [...] "not in touch" [...] with them are thought to be in need of therapy?
