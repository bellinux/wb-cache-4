During this time, Pratap and Hentig met with Enver Pasha and enjoyed an {{audience}} with the Sultan. On Enver Pasha's orders, a Turkish officer, Lieutenant Kasim Bey, was deputed to the expedition as the Turkish representative, bearing official letters addressed to the Afghan Emir and the Indian princely states.

After learning Gandhi's plans, he and other elders warned Gandhi that England would tempt him to compromise his religion, and eat and drink in Western ways. Gandhi informed them of his promise to his mother and her blessings. The local chief disregarded it, and excommunicated him an outcast. But Gandhi ignored this, and on 4 September, he sailed from Bombay to London. His brother saw him off.|$|E

He then showed the team he was packing for both trips as a motivational tactic.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Kaliningrad Oblast became an exclave, geographically separated from the rest of Russia. This isolation from the rest of Russia became even more pronounced politically when Poland and Lithuania became members of NATO and subsequently the European Union in 2004. All military and civilian land links between the region and the rest of Russia have to pass through members of NATO and the EU. Special <b>travel</b> <b>arrangements</b> for the territory's inhabitants have been made through the Facilitated Transit Document (FTD) and Facilitated Rail Transit Document (FRTD).|$|E

25|$|Both Anthony and Stanton {{joined the}} lecture circuit about 1870, usually {{traveling}} from mid-autumn to spring. The timing was right because {{the nation was}} beginning to discuss women's suffrage as a serious matter. Occasionally they traveled together but most often not. Lecture bureaus scheduled their tours and handled the <b>travel</b> <b>arrangements,</b> which generally involved traveling {{during the day and}} speaking at night, sometimes for weeks at a time, including weekends. Their lectures brought new recruits into the movement who strengthened suffrage organizations at the local, state and national levels. Their journeys during that decade covered a distance that was unmatched by any other reformer or politician.|$|E
25|$|More {{than two}} dozen European leaders, {{including}} President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev, were the main dignitaries to join {{the hundreds of thousands}} of Poles.

President of Romania Traian Băsescu flew by helicopter to the northwest of his country before driving on through Hungary and Slovakia. Prime Minister of Estonia Andrus Ansip drove for 18 hours for 1,300 kilometres. President of the Czech Republic Václav Klaus used car and train to travel the required 525 kilometres. President of Slovakia Ivan Gašparovič drove 300 kilometres from Bratislava. President of Hungary László Sólyom and his Prime Minister Gordon Bajnai drove from Budapest. Former President of Ukraine Viktor Yushchenko and his wife set out by road from Budapest.|$|E
25|$|The first {{international}} conclave attended by Fraina {{as representative of}} the CPA was a secret conference conducted by the short-lived Western European Bureau of the Communist International, slated to begin on February 10, 1920, in Amsterdam. As {{he was not a}} citizen of the United States, Fraina was forced to make this trip without a passport and legal visas. The services of one Jacob Nosovitsky were employed by the CPA to aid with Fraina's <b>travel</b> <b>arrangements</b> and to accompany him abroad. Nosivitsky, believed to be an active and trustworthy member of the Communist movement and an individual who had been used as a secret international courier, was in actuality a police spy working undercover in the radical movement and reporting on the activities of its principals to the U.S. Department of Justice as its special employee N-100.|$|E

25|$|Kaliningrad's {{isolation}} was {{enhanced by}} the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 when Lithuania became an independent country and even more when both Poland and Lithuania became members of NATO and subsequently the European Union in 2004. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the independence of the Baltic states, Kaliningrad Oblast has been separated from the rest of Russia by other countries instead of by other Soviet republics. Neighboring nations imposed strict border controls when they joined the European Union. All military and civilian land links between the region and the rest of Russia have to pass through members of NATO and the EU. Russian proposals for visa-free travel between the EU and Kaliningrad have so far been rejected by the EU. <b>Travel</b> <b>arrangements,</b> based on the Facilitated Transit Document (FTD) and Facilitated Rail Transit Document (FRTD) have been made.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after WCW was {{purchased}} by the World Wrestling Federation in March 2001, Bagwell {{was one of the}} first AOL Time Warner contracted wrestlers to accept the offered buy-out on his contract and sign with the WWF. On July 1, 2001, Bagwell faced Booker T at a house show and he made his WWF televised debut on the July 2 episode of Raw is War, facing Booker T for the WCW Championship. The match went to a no-contest after interference from Stone Cold Steve Austin and Kurt Angle. When Bagwell arrived to the Raw tapings on July 9 in Atlanta, Georgia, he was informed he was being released from his contract due to complaints about his attitude and an altercation with fellow WCW alumnus Shane Helms. There were also accusations that Bagwell faked an injury at the July 3 SmackDown! tapings after receiving an aided powerbomb from the Acolytes Protection Agency. The accusations also claimed his mother Judy was calling WWF offices to request that her son get time off to heal from an injury supposedly inflicted to Bagwell from the aided powerbomb and to complain about her son's <b>travel</b> <b>arrangements.</b> However, Bagwell himself claims that he never understood why he was fired from the WWF.|$|E
