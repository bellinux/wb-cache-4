When she learns that she cannot afford coaching from Tiny's trainer, Hector Soto, she asks her father for an allowance but he tells her to get a job. She resorts to stealing his money instead and returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gym,</b> where Hector begins to teach her the basics of boxing.|$|E
5|$|The footage was {{captured}} on two Sony HVR-Z1 camcorders. Costumes had been purchased at an Oxfam charity shop in Dalston, East London, while a wig worn by Ashley {{in one scene}} was purchased from a Dalston wig store. Knowing that he would appear nude in several scenes, Ryder went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gym</b> regularly in the weeks proceeding filming to gain greater muscle tone. He decided to include footage {{from one of his}} pornographic videos in Uncle David, inspired to do so after learning that serial killers Fred and Rosemary West screened pornography throughout the day in their home.|$|E
5|$|Rhys {{meets with}} Jim Dolan {{for his first}} round of {{chemotherapy}} and assures him {{it is a simple}} procedure. He learns Karl and Susan Kennedy have been giving Jim advice about his treatment and he asks them to stop. A few days later, Jim informs Rhys that he wants to stop the chemotherapy. Rhys meets Kate Ramsay at the local bar and they have a one-night stand. During his rounds, Rhys checks on Jim and stays with him as he dies. Affected by Jim's death, Rhys goes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gym</b> looking for distraction and he befriends Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan). Rhys flirts with Jade Mitchell (Gemma Pranita), but she rebuffs his advances. Jade later asks for Rhys' help in getting her housemate, Michelle Tran (HaiHa Le), to move out. Nurse Danielle Paquette (Georgia Bolton) questions Karl and Rhys about a mistake on an unsigned prescription form and Rhys covers for Karl. He then asks Karl if he can join his golf game with Martin Chambers, the head of surgery. Kyle invites Rhys to move in with him and Jade and he accepts. Kyle defends Rhys when he flirts with Steve Barnes' (Nicholas Gunn) girlfriend, but he refuses to listen when Rhys tells him to walk away. Steve punches Kyle, who becomes angry with Rhys for leaving him. Rhys apologises and hires a cleaner for the house to make it up to Kyle.|$|E

25|$|While {{students}} in {{lower secondary school}} stay in their classroom {{for most of the}} time (during physical education they go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gym</b> for example), in high school they will be the one to move from the classroom to the laboratory, but the teacher still has to move from one classroom to another if the lesson is not held in a laboratory.|$|E
50|$|The Double End Bag: Also {{known as}} the floor-ceiling bag, crazy bag, or the reflex bag, the double end bag is hooked up by two thin elastic ropes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gym's</b> ceiling and floor, and because of that, it moves around easily, giving the boxer good {{equipment}} for target practice and timing.|$|R
50|$|In addition, each {{goal was}} {{anchored}} by two far-reaching beams attached to support columns, with extra support coming from cables stretching all <b>the</b> way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gym's</b> ceiling. In <b>the</b> {{case of a}} backboard shatter or beam fracture, replacing these goals would be highly difficult, compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> usual goal setup at most venues.|$|R

Two professional boxers belonging <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same <b>gym</b> have not been allowed to fight against each other unless one of them transfers to other gym, because it might disrupt <b>the</b> <b>gym</b> system. However, it is often quite difficult for boxers <b>to</b> transfer between <b>the</b> <b>gyms</b> due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> matters on transfer fees, match fees and so on.|$|R

25|$|After his quarter final World Matchplay defeat by Terry Jenkins, Van Barneveld {{took another}} sabbatical from darts.

50|$|The Park Hill campus has {{undergone}} a series of remodeling efforts within {{the last decade or}} so to upgrade or replace many of its aging facilities.

25|$|Oefelein {{reportedly}} provided Nowak with a {{cell phone}} to communicate with him. Phone records show that she called him at least 12 times, and sent 7 text messages {{the day after he}} returned from his shuttle flight on December 22 that he did not retrieve until December 24 when they had a 7-minute conversation. During December and January, over 100 calls were recorded, although it is unclear who called whom. Under questioning by NASA and military investigators, Oefelein reportedly stated that he had broken off the relationship with Nowak. He did, however, have her to lunch in his apartment at least once in January, they continued to train together for a bicycle race, and they also went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gym</b> together.|$|E
25|$|Kirkman was {{inspired}} to box by his older brother, Steve, whom he frequently sparred with for fun. A school friend who noticed his {{lack of interest in}} reading suggested the book Somebody Up There Likes Me to him. In a short time, he had finished the book. Shortly thereafter, the book was made into a self-titled film, to which Kirkman was elated to discover. The duo convinced Kirkman that his future lay in boxing. Kirkman's first training sessions at age 14 involved traveling to a south Seattle gymnasium to work out from his school in Renton, Washington. The venue was suggested to him by former professional Joey Velez. Kirkman took a year-long hiatus from boxing due to injury, but returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gym</b> and won several local Golden Gloves events afterward, slowly building a reputation.|$|E
25|$|Triggers are {{reminders}} {{that may be}} explicit or implicit about {{the performance of a}} behavior. Examples of triggers can be alarms, text messages or advertisement, triggers are usually perceptual in nature but may also be intrinsic. One of the most important aspects of a trigger is timing as only certain times are best for triggering certain behaviors. As an example if a person is trying to go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gym</b> everyday, but only remembers about packing clothing once out of the house it is less likely that this person will head back home and pack. In contrast if an alarm sounds right before leaving the house reminding about packing clothing, this will take considerably less effort. Although the original article does not have any references for the reasoning or theories behind the model, some of its elements can be traced to social psychology theories, e.g., the motivation and ability factors and its success or failure are related to Self-efficacy.|$|E

The auditorium came in 1979, thanks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> joint contributions of the Board of Education and the C.H. Musselman Foundation.

500|$|When {{the blog}} had been active for six months, Sánchez {{expressed}} her reason for blogging, saying that her initial inspiration {{had been to}} create an aid to help her deal with the frustrations she felt with the situation in Cuba, [...] and of trying {{to go along with}} the advice of friends who suggested she [...] be cautious and wait, rather than more [...] "noble motives". [...] She tried [...] "silence and evasion," [...] yoga, Tai Chi, going <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gym,</b> all with no results. She finally found a means to express these frustrations, by blogging. [...] Even so, she admits [...] "I can both get discouraged have sudden starts. I alternate between “It‘s working!” to “It’s not worth the pain”; alerting her readers to not be [...] "surprised if the catharsis rises in tone, if I become incendiary, or show a streak of pessimism." ...|$|E
500|$|As a {{freshman}}, {{he played}} junior varsity for Lake Central and once made a game-winning half-court shot. That year he {{became obsessed with}} his dream of dunking and even bought special shoes and wore ankle weights to help his dream come true. At the time, his father lived in Atlanta and Robinson grew up with his mother, Shantelle Clay-Irving and younger brother Gelen. During the summer between his freshman and sophomore season, he came under the wing of two substitute father figures: Dave Milausnic, Lake Central Varsity Basketball head coach, and Wayne Brumm, AAU SYF Players under-17 coach. Milausnic convinced Robinson to come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gym</b> for early morning workouts, often waking Robinson at his home. Brumm, who would eventually continue to mentor Robinson as a collegian, advised Robinson to hire a personal trainer named Andrew Wallen, who helped Robinson augment his vertical leap. He also helped Robinson bulk up from [...] prior to his sophomore year to [...] in two years. Growing up, Robinson has not embodied the tough vocal demeanor {{that his father had}} and then his brother developed. His passive nature has shown itself in all facets of Robinson's life including his basketball game.|$|E
5000|$|A wide hallway bisects the {{two main}} rooms on the first floor, running east-west. The academy has {{maintained}} the gothic interior architecture of this hallway during the many different renovations of Hayes.
