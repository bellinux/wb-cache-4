Dooley's musings, since the war, had been entirely on affairs outside Chicago, with no Bridgeport columns, as Dunne needed to satisfy <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{national}} audience.

This was the last Dooley piece written for a newspaper not to be syndicated; it appeared exclusively in the Journal.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} reasons put forth {{as to why}} Dickinson and the Pennsylvania Council did not act. The Council's {{official}} reasoning {{was that they were}} unsure that the local militiamen would actually protect Congress from their fellow soldiers. Further, the council may have thought that the conflict was not as serious as Congress believed and that the mutiny could be resolved peacefully. The second theory put forth is that Dickinson, having been an officer in the militia, was sympathetic to the soldiers' grievances. The third theory is that the Council refused to allow Pennsylvania, a sovereign state, to be subjugated by <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few members of Congress.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{preliminary}} draft paper is to identify a framework for studying demand in hierarchical networks. <b>A</b> specific choice <b>of</b> technical conditions are given for precisely formulating four equivalent well-known ways to specify <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> buyer: by a demand function, an inverse demand function, a valuation function, or a demand set. Unimodality (or quasi-concavity) <b>of</b> profit is <b>a</b> basic property insuring the ability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> seller to find a profit maximizing operating point. Conditions on <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> buyer are identified which insure that the profit <b>of</b> <b>a</b> seller with fixed production cost is <b>a</b> unimodality function, <b>of</b> either the price set or quantity sold. Five methods are identified for aggregating <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> buyer, and three methods are indentified for combining competing sellers. ...|$|R

Internally at UNDP, which was facing increased competition from the World Bank in its areas of responsibility such as capacity building, governance and emergency recovery, he tried to re orient UNDP's activities (sometimes controversially), because of competition with other UN agencies who were also adapting to <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> globalising world.

25|$|The Greek Street {{building}} became {{unsuitable for}} <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> modern school, so the governors looked to locate to another site - where the school remains to this day.

25|$|With <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large {{home and}} four young boys to raise, Mulligan's mother hired an African-American nanny named Lily Rose, who became {{especially}} {{fond of the}} youngest Mulligan. As he became older, Mulligan began spending time at Rose's house and was especially amused by Rose's player piano, which Mulligan later recalled as having rolls by numerous players, including Fats Waller. Black musicians sometimes came through town, and because many motels would not take them, they often had to stay at homes within the black community. The young Mulligan occasionally met such musicians staying at Rose's home.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, the Pakistani {{government}} implemented an autonomy {{package for}} Gilgit-Baltistan, which entails rights {{similar to those}} of Pakistanâ€™s other provinces. Gilgit-Baltistan thus gains province-like status without actually being conferred such status constitutionally. Direct rule by Islamabad has been replaced by an elected legislative assembly under a chief minister. The 2009 reform has not satisfied locals who demand citizenship rights and it has continued to leave Gilgit Baltistan's constitutional status within Pakistan undefined; although it has added to the self-identification of the territory. According to Antia Mato Bouzas, the PPP-led Pakistani government had attempted a compromise between its official position on Kashmir and <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> population where the majority may have pro-Pakistan sentiments.|$|E
25|$|While {{referred}} to as social group work (Papell & Rothman,1966), Schwartz p{{referred to}} think of this model as social work with groups (Schwartz, 1976). Schwartz (1976) regarded this approach as resonant with <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> variety of group types including, natural and formed; therapeutic and task; open and closed; and voluntary and mandatory. Schwartz (1961, 1964) initially thought of this approach as an organic systems model (as he viewed the group as an organic whole) later to refer to it as the mediating model and then the interactionist model (Schwartz, 1977). The model initially proposed by Schwartz has been further developed most notably by Lawrence Shulman and Alex Gitterman, who have since referred to this model as the Mutual Aid Model (Gitterman, 2004, 2005; Shulman, 1979, 1992, 1999, 2005b).|$|E
25|$|Being {{experienced}} and having many important relationships, {{he was a}} prominent member of a regency but he looked too much {{to the past and}} the traditions during the Thirty Years' War and therefore lacked a vision suitable to <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new era. The regency was divided into parties. De la Gardie was the main representative of the party in favour of warlike adventures and a close relationship to France. The opponents, represented by Lord High Treasurer Gustaf Bonde, Lord High Steward Per Brahe the Younger and Johan Gyllenstierna, were advocates of a more peaceful and economical way. The opinions of De la Gardie's side most often won out and, therefore, Sweden was nearly drawn into wars against Russia and Poland during the regency period. Early on in the period, in 1661, Sweden and France signed a treaty which included a secret paragraph committing Sweden to support the French candidate on the first vacancy of the Polish throne, in exchange for a large sum of money. In April 1672, the two allies signed a new treaty in Stockholm. According to this treaty, Sweden would keep an army of 16,000 men in its German dominions to make sure the German states would not interfere in a war between France and its enemies the Netherlands and Spain. In return, Sweden would receive 400,000 riksdaler annually in peacetime. In wartime, the amount would be increased to 600,000 riksdaler. In a Sweden with great financial problems, these subsidies was, in Count De la Gardie's thinking, a more attractive way to improve the state's finances than a reduction, which would mean that lands granted the nobility would be reclaimed by the Crown.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the basic}} {{assumptions}} of the classical dynamic lot-sizing model is that <b>the</b> aggregate <b>demand</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given period must be satisfied in that period. Under this assumption, if backlogging is not allowed then <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given period cannot be delivered earlier or later than the period. If backlogging is allowed, <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given period cannot be delivered earlier than the period, but can be delivered later at the expense <b>of</b> <b>a</b> backordering cost. Like most mathematical models, the classical dynamic lot-sizing model is <b>a</b> simplified paraphrase <b>of</b> what might actually happen in real life. In most real life applications, the customer offers a grace period - {{we call it a}} demand time window - during which a particular demand can be satisfied with no penalty. That is, in association with each <b>demand,</b> <b>the</b> customer specifies an earliest and a latest delivery time. The time interval characterized by the earliest and latest delivery dates <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>demand</b> represents <b>the</b> corresponding time window.|$|R
