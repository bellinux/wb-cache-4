5|$|Barnes {{had been}} a regular member of the Australian cricket team since World War II and was on his second trip to England after making his Test debut there in 1938 before the war.

Bootstrap and permutation versions of W 50, L 50 and R tests have been also considered. Type-one error rate and power of <b>the</b> <b>tests</b> are investigated. <b>The</b> computationally simplest robust <b>test</b> is <b>the</b> W 50.
