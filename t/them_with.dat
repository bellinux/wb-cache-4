5|$|As {{a result}} of these problems, in 1954 serious {{consideration}} was given to scrapping the class and replacing <b>them</b> <b>with</b> Britannia class locomotives.

5|$|At the {{approach}} {{to the west of}} the important city of Augusta Taurinorum (Turin, Italy), Constantine met a large force of heavily armed Maxentian cavalry.

Constantine's armies emerged victorious. Turin refused to give refuge to Maxentius' retreating forces, opening its gates to Constantine instead. Other cities of the north Italian plain sent Constantine embassies of congratulation for his victory. He moved on to Milan, where he was met with open gates and jubilant rejoicing. Constantine rested his army in Milan until mid-summer 312AD, when he moved on to Brixia (Brescia).|$|E

If recognized as a mate, it will be carried to the queen to mate.

5|$|Historically, {{people could}} {{do little to}} protect their crops from being devastated by locusts, {{although}} eating the insects {{may have been some}} consolation. By the early 20th century, efforts were being made to disrupt the development of the insects by cultivating the soil where eggs were laid, collecting hoppers with catching machines, killing <b>them</b> <b>with</b> flamethrowers, trapping them in ditches, and crushing <b>them</b> <b>with</b> rollers and other mechanical methods. By the 1950s, the organochloride dieldrin was found to be an extremely effective insecticide, but it was later banned from use in most countries because of its persistence in the environment and its bioaccumulation in the food chain.|$|E
