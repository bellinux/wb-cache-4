5|$|A {{small area}} of {{convection}} not associated from the ITCZ became Tropical Disturbance 10 on April1, about 215km (350mi) west-northwest of the Cocos Islands in the Australian region. It moved west-southwestward, entering the south-west Indian Ocean on April2, {{and on the}} same date the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 16S. The thunderstorms organized into a small central dense overcast, and there was evidence of an eye feature, suggesting the system could have been much stronger. Although satellite imagery had difficulty in tracking the low-level circulation, a nearby ship on April3 confirmed {{the presence of a}} circulation. Operationally the system was only classified as a tropical depression. However, data from QuikSCAT helped upgrade <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>to</b> moderate tropical storm status in a post-season analysis, with peak winds of 65km/h (40mph) on April3; as a result, it was not named. After previously moving to the west-southwest, the small storm turned back to the west due to a strengthening ridge to the south. Wind shear increased on April4, which rapidly dwindled the convection and thereby leaving behind an exposed circulation. It underwent the Fujiwhara effect with a larger disturbance to the east, causing <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>to</b> turn back to the north and dissipate on April5.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the eastern Pacific on July17. Tracking west-northwest, the system acquired enough organization to be upgraded to a tropical depression at 0000UTC on July22, while positioned 460mi (740km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico. Following formation, moderate northeasterly shear inhibited significant development, causing <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>to</b> remain a tropical depression for 48 hours. A mid-level ridge over Mexico caused <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>to</b> turn northwest as shear began to decrease; at 0000UTC on July24, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Dalila. After attaining its peak intensity with winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 995mb (hPa; 29.39inHg) a day later, the storm tracked over progressively cool waters, {{causing it to}} weaken. At 0600UTC on July27, Dalila weakened to a tropical storm, and by 1800UTC, the system no longer retained enough organization {{to be considered a}} tropical cyclone. The remnant low tracked west, southwest, and eventually south prior to dissipation at 1200UTC on July30.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on June27 and tracked westward {{to reach the}} eastern Pacific on July8. There, the system steadily gained organization and was declared a tropical depression by 1200UTC on July14. Moving slowly northwest, a low wind shear and warm sea surface temperature environment allowed <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>to</b> strengthen to a tropical storm at 1800UTC on July15. Following {{the development of a}} curved convection band and appearance of an eye on satellite, Cosme was upgraded to a Category1 hurricane at 1800UTC the next day; it is at this time that the system attained its peak with winds of 75mph (120km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 987mb (hPa; 29.15inHg). Cosme tracked over ever cooler waters beginning at that time, causing <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>to</b> weaken quickly back to tropical storm strength. It turned west {{as a result of an}} intensifying ridge of high pressure to its north while continuing to deteriorate in organization. At 1800UTC on July18, Cosme weakened to a tropical depression after crossing into the central Pacific, and by 1800UTC on July22, no longer sustained enough organization to be considered a tropical cyclone. The remnant low continued generally westward until dissipation early on July25.|$|E

5|$|An area of {{convection}} persisted on January19 off {{the east}} coast of Madagascar, which became Tropical Disturbance 6 two days later.

5|$|As {{the wind}} shear decreased, the {{convection}} increased further, and the IMD upgraded <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>to</b> a deep depression at 00:00UTC on June1. Later that day, the system began rapidly intensifying while moving on a northwest trajectory; the IMD upgraded <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>to</b> a cyclonic storm at 09:00UTC, naming it Phet. An eye became evident during a Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) pass of the storm; its appearance {{and the development}} of rainbands showed Phet was intensifying. Late on June1, the JTWC upgraded the storm to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, estimating 1minute maximum sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph), after the eye became better defined and the tightly-curved thunderstorm activity. The IMD upgraded Phet to severe cyclonic storm status at 00:00UTC on June2, and further to a very severe cyclonic storm six hours later.|$|E
5|$|By July 11, dry air and {{unfavorable}} {{wind shear}} prevented the convection from developing near the center.

On July 13, forecasters expected <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>to</b> be absorbed by the approaching trough. However, the low pressure area emerged into the western Atlantic Ocean near North Carolina early on July 14, and upon doing so its convection increased and became better organized. The circulation and convection became further defined, and the National Hurricane Center estimates the system developed into Tropical Depression One late on July 14 about 45miles (75km) west-southwest of Hatteras, North Carolina.|$|E
