5|$|At Unbreakable, the TNA X Division Championship was defended in a Three Way match by then-champion Christopher Daniels against A.J. Styles and Samoa Joe. Styles won {{the match}} {{and the title}} at the event. This led to TNA {{promoting}} a Thirty-Minute Iron Man match between Styles and Daniels for the title at Bound for Glory. This was a rematch between the two that took place at Against All Odds. Other events that lead to this match included the 2005 TNA Super X Cup Tournament, which caused the Three Way match at Unbreakable, and Daniels defeating Styles in an Ultimate X Challenge match at TNA's Destination X PPV event on March13 to become champion. On the October8 episode of Impact!, Daniels issued a challenge to Styles to pick three wrestlers on the roster and he would defeat {{all of them in}} fifteen minutes or less. Styles accepted the challenge and chose Shark Boy, Sonjay Dutt, and himself. Daniels defeated both Shark Boy and Dutt before the <b>time-limit</b> expired, but did not defeat Styles in time on the October15 episode of Impact!.|$|E

At the semi-finals at No Surrender, Hardy first wrestled Kurt Angle to a twenty-minute <b>time-limit</b> draw, after which Eric Bischoff ordered a five-minute period of extra time. After that and a second five-minute extra time period also ended in draws, it was ruled that Angle was unable to continue and the match ended in a no contest.

5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was {{defended by}} A.J. Styles against Christopher Daniels in a Thirty-Minute Iron Man match. In an Iron Man match, a <b>time-limit</b> {{is set for}} a {{particular}} amount, in this case thirty-minutes. The match will continue until time runs out and the competitor who gained the most falls when time runs out by pinfall, submission, count-out, or disqualification is the overall winner of the bout. Daniels attempted to get Styles to submit early in the bout by using his Koji Clutch submission hold. Later on, Daniels earned a two-count after landing on Styles with his signature B.M.E. aerial maneuver. Styles also gained a near-fall by holding Daniels on his shoulders before twisting him off and slamming him to the mat {{for what he calls}} a Rack Bomb. With only 13 seconds left in the match and the score still tied zero to zero, Styles performed his signature Styles Clash maneuver and followed with the pin. As time ran out, Styles had the most falls thus retaining the TNA X Division Championship.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules that}} can be used in a match vary {{depending}} on the game, but the most commonly used settings across all games are Time and Stock. Time mode uses a point based system in which fighters earn points for knocking out their opponents and lose points for being knocked out or self-destructing (i.e. falling out of the arena by themselves). The player with the highest score at the end of the set time limit wins the match. Survival uses a life-based system in which players are given a set number of lives, known as stock, with each fighter losing a life whenever they are knocked out, becoming eliminated if they run out of lives. The winner is the last fighter standing once all other fighters are eliminated or, if a <b>time-limit</b> is applied to the match, the fighter with the most lives remaining once time runs out. In the event of a tie, such as two or more fighters sharing the highest score/life count at the end of the time limit or remaining fighters losing their last life simultaneously, a Sudden Death match takes place. Here, each of the tied fighters are given a starting damage percentage of 300%, making them easier to launch off the stage, and the last fighter standing wins the match. In some games this process is repeated if the match ends in another tie.|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{sampling}} and reconstruction of <b>time-limited</b> signals. Finite-energy, <b>time-limited</b> signals can be represented using <b>time-limited</b> orthogonal Fourier basis functions, and a finite linear combination can approximate a signal with the assumption that most of the signal energy is concentrated in a certain frequency band. The expansion coefficients in this approximation are uniform samples of the frequency spectrum. As <b>time-limited</b> signals are not bandlimited, we propose the use of finite-duration sum-of-sincs sampling kernel, which annihilates the effect of aliasing at desired frequency locations with a suitable choice of the sampling frequency. This method does not require inner product operations for each coefficient in the expansion. An expression for the approximation error is derived. Experiments are performed on both simulated and natural <b>time-limited</b> signals and compared with widely used Shannon-Nyquist sampling and reconstruction method. The reconstruction error using the proposed method is smaller by 2 - 20 dB compared with the Shannon-Nyquist method...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} experience of existential counselling psychologists and psychotherapists providing <b>time-limited</b> therapy. Ten participants were interviewed, using semi-structured interviews, focusing on the emotions, meaning-making processes and attitudes that constitute their experience. The material was analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis - IPA. Five superordinate themes were identified, highlighting the main constituents of {{the experience of}} existential therapists in <b>time-limited</b> settings: the experience of time-limitation, the experience of ending, the experience of the therapeutic process, attitudes towards <b>time-limited</b> therapy and support systems. Existing literature on <b>time-limited</b> therapy and the existential approach was utilised to shed light on the results and to reach {{a better understanding of the}} implications that this study has on the existential approach, supervisory and training settings, and counselling psychology. It is suggested that existential <b>time-limited</b> therapy is particularly relevant for the widespread provision of <b>time-limited</b> therapies, and its application is based on three main values: the philosophical value, the relational value and the holistic value. The importance of support systems for therapists providing existential <b>time-limited</b> therapy, in the form of supervision and training, was also highlighted, with reference to the particular challenges and opportunities that such a work entails. Finally, the contribution of this study to the division of Counselling Psychology, and the necessity for such a research in order to safeguard the division’s values, promote its pluralistic identity, and provide ethical and competent services to those in need, is also presented...|$|R
25|$|The Austrian {{university}} system had been open to any student who passed the Matura examination until recently. A 2006 bill allowed {{the introduction of}} entrance exams for studies such as Medicine. In 2001, an obligatory tuition fee ("Studienbeitrag") of €363.36 per term was introduced for all public universities. There are some non-state exceptions to this, where students can still study for a subsidized education, for example within the campus system of the English Teacher Training College. Since 2008, for all EU students the studies have been free of charge, {{as long as a}} certain <b>time-limit</b> is not exceeded (the expected duration of the study plus usually two terms tolerance). When the <b>time-limit</b> is exceeded, the fee of around €363.36 per term is charged. Some further exceptions to the fee apply, e.g. for students with a year's salary of more than about €5000. In all cases, an obligatory fee of €17 is charged for the student union and insurance.|$|E

30|$|Wage {{subsidies}} are either paid indefinitely, {{so long as}} the worker remains eligible, or are <b>time-limited.</b> <b>Time-limited</b> {{subsidies are}} usually targeted on newly hired workers who were previously unemployed (sometimes within a demographic or geographic class). For example, Colombia subsidizes firms that hire women over the age of 40 who have been unemployed at least 12 months. Common durations for <b>time-limited</b> subsidies are six months to two years. There are several different rationales for <b>time-limited</b> subsidies. In some cases, they are used as a countercyclical measure to combat a rise in unemployment. The “learning-by-doing” theory also justifies temporary subsidies after which workers are expected to have acquired sufficient skills to make them productive enough for finding employment on an unsubsidized basis. If this is the case, <b>time-limiting</b> the subsidy is one way to achieve the employment effects of wage subsidies while greatly reducing windfall effects. As noted above, however, if the learning-by-doing hypothesis does not hold true, or if the duration of the subsidy is not sufficient to significantly enhance the worker’s skills, <b>time-limited</b> subsidies create only a temporary employment effect and, at the same time, create a perverse incentive for “churning” – letting workers go when their subsidy expires and replacing them with new subsidized workers.|$|R

Sting lost to Flair in several non-televised rematches following the Clash and, later that year, battled other members of Flair's stable, the Four Horsemen. Sting teamed with Koloff at The Great American Bash in July 1988 to challenge Horsemen Tully Blanchard and Arn Anderson for the NWA World Tag Team Championship; Blanchard and Anderson retained the titles when the match ended in a 20-minute <b>time-limit</b> draw.|$|E
25|$|In {{the tournament}} quarterfinals Royce and Sakuraba battled {{for an hour}} and a half (six 15 minute rounds). Gracie opened the fight aggressively, raining punches from Kazushi's back while the Japanese worked an armlock from standing, but Sakuraba kept calm, knowing Royce had no {{knockout}} power and expecting him to waste his energy; he even came to the point of smiling to the cameras during the attack (Sakuraba went on later to claim that he was actually greeting a cameraman who was a personal friend of his). Towards the end of the round, Sakuraba nearly ended the match with a kneebar, while Gracie came back with a guillotine choke at the second, but Kazushi again joked to show he was out of danger by simulating to pull down Royce's gi pants. Sakuraba switched to attack at the third round, dominating the stand up and making Royce lie repeatedly on the ground to avoid him. As the confrontation stretched on, the Gracie's own no <b>time-limit</b> rules began to work against Royce as Sakuraba's wrestling skills and balance nullified Royce's ability to score a takedown and—in some instances—even pull guard. Even Royce's ever-present jiu-jitsu gi became a weapon for the wrestler to use against him as Sakuraba used it to help him control Gracie on the instances the fight did come to the ground. However, with Sakuraba's control of the takedown, these instances of ground warfare became increasingly sporadic. After Kazushi landed a long series of punishing leg kicks at the fifth and sixth rounds, Royce's brother, Rorion threw in the towel.|$|E

40|$|Research {{suggests}} that high-anxious female students underperform in <b>time-limited</b> examinations {{compared to their}} low-anxious counterparts. Consequently, {{the purpose of this}} investigation was to determine whether differential performance on <b>time-limited</b> and time-unlimited sta-tistics examinations, would be associated with test anxiety. Twenty-one female graduate students, enrolled in a statistics course, were assigned randomly to either a time-unlimited or <b>time-limited</b> examination condi-tion. An interaction was found between test anxiety and examination condition, with high anxiety tending to be associated more strongly with underachievement in the <b>time-limited</b> than the time-unlimited condi-tion. Implications for increasing the statistics performance of female students are discussed. Statistics test anxiety {{has been found to be}} experienced by many college students (Onwuegbuzie, Da Ros, & Ryan, 1994; Zeidner, 1991). In par-ticular, women tend to report higher levels of anxiety in statistics courses than do men (Benson, 1989; Demaria-Mitton, 1987).

Thus, the purpose of the present study was to assess the relationship between statistics test anxiety and performance of female students examined under <b>time-limited</b> versus time-unlimited conditions.
