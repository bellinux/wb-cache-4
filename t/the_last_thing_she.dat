Trey filmed without Nicole's consent, when she found out the truth she ended their relationship. Trey thought she and Geoff were getting back together so aired the tape at a local film festival to gain revenge.

Being the partner of Pain, Konan was also a pupil under Jiraiya after she was orphaned as a child by one of Amegakure's many wars and forced to fend for herself. Because she serves under Pain, she is referred to by villagers of Amegakure as [...] "God's angel". While under Jiraiya, Konan learned {{to take advantage of}} her natural talent with origami, using it as a key component in her battle style. Konan can divide her body into countless sheets of paper, which she controls and reshapes remotely to scout out an area, form weapons for attack, or create wings that mirror her title. While Konan's abilities are restricted when the paper is wet, since paper will cling to itself and lose its stiffness, she is able to use this weakness to her advantage as she implements explosive tags into her paper clones. After Nagato's death, Konan withdraws her position in Akatsuki and proclaims loyalty to Naruto. Later, she is confronted by Obito over the location of Nagato's Rinnegan eyes. She fights him in a suicide assault, though is killed after being forced to reveal Nagato's resting place.

500|$|The {{series is}} {{illustrated}} by Fiona Staples, who was introduced to Vaughan by their mutual friend, writer Steve Niles, with whom Staples worked on Mystery Society. Vaughan, who did not meet Staples in person until just before their panel at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con, explained his selection of Staples by describing his reaction upon first seeing her work, saying [...] "Her artwork is incredible. [...] doesn't look like anyone else. She is very unique. When I opened up this file I was like, 'This is going to work! Staples is co-owner of Saga and was given first billing {{on the cover of}} issue 31. In addition to designing all the characters, vehicles and alien races in the story, she provides painted covers and hand-letters Hazel's narration using her own handwriting, which is <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> does after finishing the artwork on a page. Staples renders the characters in a pen-and-ink style line while using all-color settings inspired by video games and Japanese animation. At the 2012 Image Expo, Staples described the process by which she produces her art as harkening back to animation cels, in which emphasis is placed on figures and backgrounds. Vaughan has stated that Staple's style has influenced the direction of the story. The character Ghüs, for example is entirely Staples' creation. Another example is the organic forms of most of the series' technology, such as the main characters' wooden rocket ship, which is derived from Staples' dislike of drawing mechanical objects. To design the series' various planetary settings, Staples looks to the real world for inspiration and then exaggerates some elements of them. Some rooms on the planet Cleave, for example, were inspired by Cambodian architecture.|$|E

2500|$|On Ashley's {{first day}} of college, {{investigators}} came to her school to question her about her father's death and to inform {{her that he had}} been poisoned instead of having died of a heart attack. An upset Ashley called Castor. Soon after, she says that Castor invited her to come to the family home in Weedsport and drink together. Castor said that they had been through enough emotional stress and needed to relax. Ashley agreed because Castor was not only her mother but her [...] "best friend". The following day, Castor invited Ashley to drink together at home again. She says that her mother offered her a [...] "nasty-tasting" [...] drink that she at first refused but eventually drank because she trusted Castor. Seventeen hours later, Ashley was found comatose on her bed by her younger sister Bree Wallace. Castor made the 911 call. Ashley's sister left her side for a moment and when she returned, she found a suicide note beside Ashley. The note appeared to be Ashley's [...] "murder confession", in which she [...] "admits" [...] to having killed her father and stepfather. Castor quickly took the note from the sister and later gave it to the paramedics. Tests revealed that potentially fatal painkillers had been found in Ashley's system, and that she most likely would have died if brought to the hospital just a few minutes later. When Ashley awakened, with police questioning her about the murders and the suicide note found beside her, she said that <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> remembered was her mother making her an alcoholic drink, something she had never done before.

And to divert Mrs. Veal, as she thought, took hold of her gown-sleeve several times, and commended it. Mrs. Veal told her, it was a scowered silk, and newly made up. But for all this, Mrs. Veal persisted in her request, and told Mrs. Bargrave, she must not deny her: and she would have her tell her brother all their conversation, when she had opportunity. Dear Mrs. Veal, says Mrs. Bargrave, this seems so impertinent, that I cannot tell how to comply with it; and what a mortifying story will our conversation be to a young gentleman? Why, says Mrs. Bargrave, it is much better, methinks to do it yourself. No, says Mrs. Veal, though it seems impertinent to you now, you will see more reason for it hereafter. Mrs. Bargrave then, to satisfy her importunity, was going to fetch a pen and ink; but Mrs. Veal said, Let it alone now, but do it when I am gone; but you must be sure to do it: which was one of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> enjoined her at parting; and so she promised her.|$|R

When he would not say so, she carried the affair through to the bitter end, and she did not spare him some, pangs which she perhaps need not have shared with him. But people are seldom man and wife for half their lives without wishing to impart their sufferings as well as their pleasures to each other; and Mrs. Kenton, if she was no worse, was no better than other wives in pressing to her husband's lips the cup that was not altogether sweet to her own. She went about the house the night before closing it, to see that everything was in a state to be left, and then she came to Kenton in his library, where he had been burning some papers and getting others ready to give in charge to his son, and sat down by his cold hearth with him, and wrung his soul with the tale of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> had been doing. When she had made him bear it all, she began to turn the bright side of the affair to him. She praised the sense and strength of Ellen, in the course the girl had taken with herself, and asked him if he, really thought they could have done less for her than they were doing. She reminded him that they were not running away from the fellow, as she had once thought they must, but Ellen was renouncing him, and putting him out of her sight till she could put him out of her mind. She did not pretend that the girl had done this yet; but it was everything that she wished to do it, {{and saw that it was}} best. Then she kissed him on his gray head, and left him alone to the first ecstasy of his homesickness.|$|R

Frankel recalls that she was nervous {{through most of the}} shooting, particularly when working late, since Raffaello Follieri, her boyfriend at that time, preferred strongly that she not do so; she was also having health issues due to a cyst. The director said she was [...] "terrified" [...] before starting her first scene with Streep, who had begun her working relationship with Hathaway by saying first [...] "I think you're perfect for the role and I'm so happy we're going to be working on this together" [...] then warning her that was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> nice <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> would say.

50|$|Shingo is {{the insane}} brother of Akiko Kiryu. They lived {{together}} in the Kiryu Manor shortly before the Russo-Japanese War. Yuta worked there temporarily and saw Shingo's cruel and sadistic behavior firsthand. Akiko tried to prevent her brother from hurting anymore people by poisoning him. She did not realize though that the poison was actually the flesh of a mermaid. Shingo seemed to die after eating it, but {{he was able to}} dig himself out of his grave and return home. His father was so upset to see him that he tried to kill him again, but that failed as well. Because of Shingo's insanity, he was kept in a cell {{in the basement of the}} Kiryu home. Once he was released, he ripped the eye out of his sisters corpse and fled. Because it is his sisters eye, every time he murders someone he sees <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>she</b> saw, his own twisted face reaching down to rip her eye out. Shingo believes that by killing his sister he can finally make the visions stop, so he continually harasses the elderly women who now live in his home. After a battle with Yuta, Yuta decapitated Akiko, then attempted to do the same with Shingo. After Shingo suffered another vision, he came to realize he would forever be tormented by his sister's last sight, and he took Yuta's sword and decapitated himself.|$|R
40|$|When someone takes {{a bite of}} {{a chicken}} filet sandwich, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> he or <b>she</b> {{wants to do is}} to bite down a piece of bone in the meat. That is also <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> food {{industry}} wants. Because there is an increase of demand for larger sortments of food products there was a need for automation of the processes involved in the preparation of the meat, fish or other food products. Using this kind of automation systems for processing the food, a higher production capacity is obtained than using manual prelucration of the food products. One of the most important processes is de debonning one. Many fast and automated systems have been developed and are being used in the food industry to separate the meat and bones [Elsten, 1991], [Hazenbroek, 1991], [Jones et al., 1999], [Heidke et al., 1999], [Wols, 2000]. During the automated meat processing stage, foreign bodies can remain in the meat. At a later stage the meat has to be inspected and the foreign bodies removed. With the deboning process there is the same problem. The speed with which the meat is deboned is direct proportional with the amount of fragments of bone...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{must stay}} on with us; you can, you know, in any {{position}} you like; any, any, any, my dear child"--and her emphasis went deep. [...] "You must make your home with us; and it's really open to you {{to make the most}} beautiful one in the world. You mustn't be under a mistake--under any of any sort; and you must let us all think for you a little, take care of you and watch over you. Above all you must help me with Kate, and you must stay a little for her; nothing for a long time has happened to me so good as that you and she should have become friends. It's beautiful; it's great; it's everything. What makes it perfect is that it should have come about through our dear delightful Susie, restored to me, after so many years, by such a miracle. No--that's more charming to me than even your hitting it off with Kate. God has been good to one--positively; for I couldn't, at my age, have made a new friend--undertaken, I mean, out of whole cloth, the real thing. It's like changing one's bankers--after fifty: one doesn't do that. That's why Susie has been kept for me, as you seem to keep people in your wonderful country, in lavender and pink paper--coming back at last as straight as out of a fairy-tale and with you as an attendant fairy." [...] Milly hereupon replied appreciatively that such a description of herself made her feel as if pink paper were her dress and lavender its trimming; but Aunt Maud was not to be deterred by a weak joke from keeping it up. Her interlocutress could feel besides that she kept it up in perfect sincerity. She was somehow at this hour a very happy woman, and a part of her happiness might precisely have been that her affections and her views were moving as never before in concert. Unquestionably she loved Susie; but she also loved Kate and loved Lord Mark, loved their funny old host and hostess, loved every one within range, down to the very servant who came to receive Milly's empty iceplate--down, for that matter, to Milly herself, who was, while she talked, really conscious of the enveloping flap of a protective mantle, a shelter with the weight of an eastern carpet. An eastern carpet, for wishing-purposes of one's own, was a thing to be on rather than under; still, however, if the girl should fail of breath it wouldn't be, she could feel, by Mrs. Lowder's fault. One of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> was afterwards to recall of this was Aunt Maud's going on to say that she and Kate must stand together because together they could do anything. It was for Kate of course she was essentially planning; but the plan, enlarged and uplifted now, somehow required Milly's prosperity too for its full operation, just as Milly's prosperity at the same time involved Kate's. It was nebulous yet, it was slightly confused, but it was unmistakably free and genial, and it made our young woman understand things Kate had said of her aunt's possibilities as well as characterisations that had fallen from Susan Shepherd. One of the most frequent on the lips of the latter had been that dear Maud was a natural force.|$|R
