60|$|The cradle, which Frank and {{his comrades}} saw working {{not far from}} the pan-washer, was by no means a complex affair. It was a {{semi-circular}} trough hollowed out of a log six feet long by sixteen inches diameter. At one end of this was a perforated copper or iron plate, with a rim of iron or wood round it, on which the dirt was thrown, and water poured thereon, by one man, while the cradle was rocked by another. The gold, earth, and small gravel were thus separated from the larger stones, and washed down the trough, in which, at intervals, two <b>tranverse</b> bars were placed; the first of these arrested the gold, which from its great weight sunk to the bottom, while the gravel, and lighter substances, were swept away by the current. The lower bar caught any particles that, by awkward management, might have passed the upper one.|$|E

40|$|Although {{hydrophilic}} pores {{have been}} inferred {{to account for}} characteristics of the movement of water molecules across erythrocyte membranes, no direct evidence has associated such pores with actual structural differentiations within the membrane. Freeze-fracture and freeze-etch studies of isolated erythrocyte membranes {{show that they are}} comprised of fluid bilayer domains <b>tranversed</b> by protein-containing intercalations (“membrane intercalated particles”). It has previously been hypothesized that the topology of the polar and apolar spaces of the membrane-intercalated particles was not concentric the hydrophobic spaces being equatorially distributed. In consequence, axial organization of the hydrophilic regions could result in hydrophilic continuity across the membrane and might provide a structural basis for passage of hydrophilic molecules. The present experiments support this hypothesis. It is shown that sublimation at - 100 ° of erythrocyte membrane suspensions (that had been incubated at pH 5. 5 to cause aggregation of the membrane particles) results in progressive and selective sinking of the membrane regions comprised of aggregates of intercalated particles, i. e., that sublimation of water molecules occurs preferentially across these membrane regions. These results indicate that, under these experimental conditions, the membrane-intercalated particles provide a preferential structural pathway for passage of water molecules across erythrocyte ghost membranes...|$|R

50|$|The Sesefsky was an all-wood machine, {{like many}} in the 1920s but also because timber was then an {{important}} Romanian export. It was a single bay biplane with two-spar wings mounted with noticeable stagger and braced with a single, broad, forward-leaning interplane strut on each side, assisted by wire cross-bracing. The upper wing was braced over the fuselage on two <b>tranverse,</b> inverted-V cabane struts and the lower one was mounted on the lower fuselage longerons. Both wings were near-rectangular in plan apart from blunted tips but they were of different size, the lower smaller in both span and chord by about 15%. Unlike the upper wing, the lower one carried slight dihedral. Only the upper wing carried ailerons, which were short, reached to the wingtips and broadened as they did so.|$|E

The first discal stigma is indicated by a small round blackish-fuscous spot resting on this. There are two blackish-fuscous dots on the <b>tranverse</b> vein, partially whitish-edged. There is also a blackish-fuscous triangular blotch with the apex touching these dots, the base rather near and parallel to the termen, edged posteriorly by a band of whitish-ochreous suffusion.

The <b>tranverse</b> sculpture of, on the body whorl, consists of about twenty- six broad flattened waves, strongly flexed, most elevated over the fasciole, and becoming narrower and less prominent anteriorly. The outer angle of the anal notch is rather prominent and makes an angulation especially of the earlier whorls, which fall away in a peculiarly flattened manner to the suture. The longitudinal sculpture consists of fine sharp grooves, which pass uniformly over the ribs and interspaces, are somewhat stronger on the earlier whorls and very uniform, only a little coarser on the siphonal canal. The notch is more marked than usual in this genus. The shell is pure white and the epidermis is grayish yellow and quite strong.|$|E

Numerous compressed <b>tranverse</b> striae are found between the interstices. The suture is linear. The narrow aperture is ovate, elongated,and slightly narrowed at its extremities. It forms at its base a little depression in an oblique siphonal canal. The outer lip is thin and arcuate.
