5|$|During 1971–72 Zappa {{released}} two strongly jazz-oriented solo LPs, Waka/Jawaka and The Grand Wazoo, {{which were}} recorded during the forced layoff from concert touring, using floating line-ups of session players and Mothers alumni.

His first effort {{was a series of}} concerts in September 1972 with a 20-piece big band referred to as the Grand Wazoo. This was followed by a scaled-down version known as the Petit Wazoo that toured the U.S. for five weeks from October to December 1972.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma is in a humid {{subtropical}} region. Oklahoma lies in {{a transition}} zone between humid continental climate to the north, semi-arid climate to the west, and humid subtropical climate in the central, south and eastern portions of the state. Most of the state {{lies in a}}n area known as Tornado Alley characterized by frequent interaction between cold, dry air from Canada, warm <b>to</b> <b>hot,</b> dry air from Mexico and the Southwestern U.S., and warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. The interactions between these three contrasting air currents produces severe weather (severe thunderstorms, damaging thunderstorm winds, large hail and tornadoes) with a frequency virtually unseen anywhere else on planet Earth. An average 62 tornadoes strike the state per year—one of the highest rates in the world.|$|E

5|$|P. moranensis {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{commonly}} cultivated Pinguicula, in part due to its large size, large and pretty flowers, and the ease with which it can be grown as a container plant. Most growers use an open soil mix composed of some combination of washed sand, perlite, vermiculite, peat moss, gypsum and/or decomposed granite. Soil should be kept well drained, but watered regularly with distilled water in the summer and only very rarely once the plant enters its winter rosette. The species grows readily on well-lit windowsills, under fluorescent lights, or in warm <b>to</b> <b>hot</b> greenhouses.|$|E
5|$|South Florida is a {{transitional}} zone between the Nearctic and Neotropical ecozones, {{resulting in a}} wide variety of plant and animal life. The intersection of ecozones brings opportunities for visitors to see species, particularly birds, that are not seen elsewhere in North America. The park includes four distinct ecosystems, each supporting its own flora and fauna. Mangrove swamp, lagoon, island key and offshore reef habitats provide diversity for many species. In this semi-tropical environment, the seasons are differentiated mainly by rainfall. Warm <b>to</b> <b>hot</b> and wet summers bring occasional tropical storms. Though only marginally cooler, the winters tend to be relatively drier. Bay salinity varies accordingly, with lower salinity levels in the wet summer, trending to more fresh water on the west side where new fresh water flows in.|$|E

5|$|Southern Manitoba (including {{the city}} of Winnipeg), falls into the humid {{continental}} climate zone (Köppen Dfb). This area is cold and windy {{in the winter and}} has frequent blizzards because of the open landscape. Summers are warm with a moderate length. This region is the most humid area in the prairie provinces, with moderate precipitation. Southwestern Manitoba, though under the same climate classification as the rest of Southern Manitoba, is closer to the semi-arid interior of Palliser's Triangle. The area is drier and more prone to droughts than other parts of southern Manitoba. This area is cold and windy in the winter and has frequent blizzards due to the openness of the prairie landscape. Summers are generally warm <b>to</b> <b>hot,</b> with low to moderate humidity.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{with the}} Soviet Union and China {{came to a}} head in the Korean War, and {{it became clear that the}} peacetime Navy would have to be much larger than ever imagined. Fleets were {{assigned}} to geographic areas around the world, and ships were sent <b>to</b> <b>hot</b> spots as a standard part of the response to the periodic crises. However, because the North Korean navy was not large, the Korean War featured few naval battles; the combatant navies served mostly as naval artillery for their in-country armies. A large amphibious landing at Inchon succeeded in driving the North Koreans back across the 38th parallel. The Battle of Chosin Reservoir ended with the evacuation of almost 105,000 UN troops from the port of Hungnam.|$|E

Snow {{falls on the}} coastal areas of the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea almost every winter, but usually melts in {{no more than a}} few days.

5|$|Under the Köppen climate classification, Boston has a humid {{continental}} climate (Köppen Dfa or Dfb) that borders a humid subtropical climate or a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen Cfa or Cfb) with some maritime influence. Despite its climate, the city {{lies at the}} transition between USDA plant hardiness zones 6b (most of the city) and 7a (Downtown, South Boston, and East Boston neighborhoods). Summers are typically warm <b>to</b> <b>hot,</b> rainy, and humid, while winters oscillate between periods of cold rain and snow, with cold temperatures. Spring and fall are usually mild, with varying conditions dependent on wind direction and jet stream positioning. Prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimize {{the influence of the}} Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Clinton {{was born}} William Jefferson Blythe III on August 19, 1946, at Julia Chester Hospital in Hope, Arkansas. He {{was the son}} of William Jefferson Blythe Jr. (1918–1946), a {{traveling}} salesman who had died in an automobile accident three months before his birth, and Virginia Dell Cassidy (later Virginia Kelley: 1923–1994). His parents married on September 4, 1943, but this union later proved to be bigamous, as Blythe was still married to his third wife. Soon after Bill was born, Virginia traveled to New Orleans to study nursing. She left her son in Hope with her parents Eldridge and Edith Cassidy, who owned and ran a small grocery store. At a time when the southern United States was racially segregated, Clinton's grandparents sold goods on credit to people of all races. In 1950, Bill's mother returned from nursing school and married Roger Clinton Sr., who owned an automobile dealership in Hot Springs, Arkansas, with his brother and Earl T. Ricks. The family moved <b>to</b> <b>Hot</b> Springs in 1950.|$|E
