There are three types of cores: fixed, movable, and loose. Fixed cores are ones that are oriented parallel to the pull direction of the dies (i.e. the direction the dies open), therefore they are fixed, or permanently attached to the die.

2500|$|Impression-die forging is {{also called}} [...] "closed-die forging". In impression-die forging, the metal {{is placed in}} a die {{resembling}} a mold, which is attached to an anvil. Usually, the hammer die is shaped as well. The hammer is then dropped on the workpiece, causing the metal to flow and fill the die cavities. The hammer is generally {{in contact with the}} workpiece on the scale of milliseconds. Depending on the size and complexity of the part, the hammer may be dropped multiple times in quick succession. Excess metal is squeezed out of the die cavities, forming what is referred to as [...] "flash".

50|$|After {{getting through}} these challenges, the real {{benefits}} of this processes were discovered. Squeeze casting allows for the addition of an insulating layer around the metal core. This results in a layer that prevents <b>the</b> <b>die</b> <b>cavity's</b> heat from melting the core that is being produced. With the insulating layer intact, the construction of this core allows it to be more easily extracted all while leaving behind the protective-insulating layer. Moreover, through this process, a low cost option of producing squeeze cores that is able to withstand high pressures has been made open to the public.|$|R

50|$|It is {{also known}} as {{impression}} die forging. Impressions are made in a pair of dies. These impressions are transferred to the work piece during deformation. A small gap between the dies called flash gutter is provided so that the excess metal can flow into the gutter and form a flash. Flash has got a very important role during deformation of the work piece inside <b>the</b> <b>die</b> <b>cavity.</b> Due to high length to thickness ratio of the flash gutter, friction in the gap is very high. Due to this the material in the flash gap is subjected to high pressure. There is high resistance to flow. This in turn promotes effective filling of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> <b>cavity.</b> In hot forging, the flash cools faster as a result of it being smaller in size. This enhances the resistance of the flash material to deformation resistance. As a result of this, the bulk of work piece is forced to deform and fill <b>the</b> <b>die</b> <b>cavity</b> more effectively - even intricate parts of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> <b>cavity</b> is filled.|$|E

Till to now, no hot embossing processes for substrates with a size of four inch or greater are published. If 4 inch (100) silicon wafers (SEMI prime quality) are used, no previous purification is necessary in order to get embossable probes. In connection with present dies (structural height: 30 nm, 30 % elevated structures), a varnish layer thickness of 250 nm is optimal. This enables a complete filling of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> <b>cavities</b> with simultaneous low residual layer thickness. Embossing conditions (p = 50 bar at a temperature of 473 K within 5 min) and maintaining the pressure during cooling down to 373 K lead to good embossing using <b>the</b> <b>dies</b> and probes on the hand press. With respect to the EV 520 HE system, the optimal embossing conditions are a pressure of 50 bar at a temperature of 453 K for 10 min and the maintaining of the pressure during the cooling down to 373 K.

The following cavities are called [...] "blocking" [...] cavities, in which the piece is working into a shape that more closely resembles the final product.

One method incorporates casting a forging preform from liquid metal. The casting is removed after it has solidified, but while still hot. It is then finished in a single cavity die. The flash is trimmed, then the part is quench hardened. Another variation follows the same process as outlined above, except the preform is produced by the spraying deposition of metal droplets into shaped collectors (similar to the Osprey process).Closed-die forging has a high initial cost due to the creation of dies and required design work to make working die cavities. However, it has low recurring costs for each part, thus forgings become more economical with more volume. This is one of the major reasons closed-die forgings are often used in the automotive and tool industries. Another reason forgings are common in these industrial sectors is that forgings generally have about a 20 percent higher strength-to-weight ratio compared to cast or machined parts of the same material.|$|E
