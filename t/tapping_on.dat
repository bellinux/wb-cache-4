5|$|Like {{previous}} {{games in}} the Mana series, Heroes of Mana features a top-down perspective, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures and enemies. Unlike prior {{games in the}} series, which are typically action role-playing games, Heroes is a real-time strategy game (RTS), in which the player controls up to 25 units in battles on fixed maps. Units are controlled via the Nintendo DS touch screen, selected by <b>tapping</b> <b>on</b> them and sent to destinations or to attack by <b>tapping</b> <b>on</b> their target. The game world is divided into an isometric grid, with one unit allowed per space. The Nintendo DS's second screen shows {{a map of the}} current mission, including which parts of the map can currently be seen by the player's units and which parts are covered by fog of war. Individual units and enemies are shown on the map in the visible areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{periodontal}} ligament becomes inflamed {{and there}} may be pain when biting or <b>tapping</b> <b>on</b> the tooth. On an X-ray, bone resporption appears as a radiolucent area around the end of the root, although this does not manifest immediately. Acute apical periodontitis is characterized by well-localized, spontaneous, persistent, moderate to severe pain. The alveolar process may be tender to palpation over the roots. The tooth may be raised in the socket and feel more prominent than the adjacent teeth.|$|E

25|$|The Touchstone is a {{wireless}} charging dock. While charging with the Touchstone, the TouchPad {{can be set}} to an Exhibition mode, allowing the user to choose to display photos in a digital photo frame, upcoming appointments, a clock, or other items (using third party extensions). The Touchstone also enables wireless communication between a HP Pre3 and a TouchPad. <b>Tapping</b> <b>on</b> a specific region will transfer web links to the Pre. This technology is known as “Touch to Share”.|$|E
25|$|The Coast Guard, {{immediately}} {{notified of}} the collision from the frantic radio calls, dispatched helicopters to the scene. One helicopter stopped at Lakefront Airport {{to pick up}} a diving team. The divers were airborne at 7:14, and arrived at 7:25. They were on the vessel at 7:34. They checked for survivors by <b>tapping</b> <b>on</b> the hull, with no response. At 8:33, they reported that there were no signs of life, and that other divers were needed to search inside the hull for bodies.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} his contract, Shields {{announced}} that he would establish his own company, Shields Crime and Security Consultants. He supported Owen Ellington's bid to succeed his former boss Rear Admiral Hardley Lewin as Police Commissioner. Through his consultancy work, he would encourage Caribbean law enforcement agencies to adopt advanced technology and forensic techniques such as DNA profiling and telephone <b>tapping</b> <b>on</b> mobile phones. However, he acknowledged that there were significant barriers to implementing these techniques, such as the atmosphere of mistrust between the policing and the telecommunications sectors in Jamaica.|$|E

25|$|The archetypical {{selection}} process {{for entry into}} a collegiate secret society began at Yale University by a process called <b>tapping.</b> <b>On</b> a publicly announced evening, Yale undergraduates would assemble informally in the College Yard. Current members of Yale's secret societies would walk {{through the crowd and}} literally tap a prospective member on the shoulder and then walk with him up to the tapped man's dorm room. There, in private, they would ask him to become a member of their secret society; the inductee had the choice of accepting or rejecting the offer of membership. During this process, it was publicly known who was being tapped for the coming year. Today, the {{selection process}} is not quite as formal, but is still public. Formal tapping days used to exist at Berkeley, and still exist in a much more formal setting at Missouri.|$|E
25|$|When {{males are}} fully mature {{they leave their}} webs {{to search for a}} {{suitable}} female, often using web characteristics to identify potential mates. Females are most likely to mate directly after their final molt at the beginning of adulthood and later in adulthood when they are feeding. There are often multiple males attempting to court the same female and thus competition for territory on the web occurs but is rarely physical as smaller males surrender area to larger ones. When males approach females they are often feeding, allowing the males to get closer without an aggressive response and also meaning the female is not moving. On approach the male makes himself known by <b>tapping</b> <b>on</b> a web strand to ensure the female is amenable before proceeding to mate. When met with aggression males will stop approaching and remain in the same location until the female relaxes or they retreat. Females engage in multiple mating but there is no benefit to the offspring as a result of this, however the energy cost of repelling a male is higher than that of allowing him to copulate. As a result of this sperm competition occurs through males altering the duration of mating as well as the frequency, longer mating is proportional to a greater likelihood of success. Sexual cannibalism is uncommon in Nephila as a result of male mating behaviours. By copulating when females are immobile after molting or inactive due to feeding the males increase their chances of survival. Males also approach {{on the opposite side of}} the web to the female making it more difficult to be caught. Sexual cannibalism does still occur and generally is more common in larger males and from older females.|$|E
500|$|On 6 January 1998, {{starting}} with [...] "Hard Cash", the third {{episode of the}} show's fourteenth series, the title sequence and theme used for nearly ten years were scrapped. This time, the title sequence consisted of various police procedural images, including a suspect being shown into a police cell, another suspect being interviewed, and a third posing for mug shot photographs. Clips {{of any of the}} actors featured were removed, as was the initial sequence involving the police car racing down the street. Pask and Morgan [...] revamped [...] "Overkill", giving it a jazz feel, with the majority of the theme played by a saxophone. The end credits of the series were also completely revamped. This time, the credits featured various images of the Metropolitan Police uniform, combined with images of a feet <b>tapping</b> <b>on</b> a kerb. A longer version of [...] "Overkill" [...] was also used in the final credits, this time composed by Mark Russell. These opening and closing sequences were used for nearly three years, although both saw minor updates in 1999. The text sequence at the very start of the opening sequence was changed into a different font, and the images of the police uniform and feet <b>tapping</b> <b>on</b> a curb were removed from the closing sequence {{to make way for a}} preview of the next episode. The closing sequence remained this way until 2001, but the opening titles were once again updated in 2000 to remove certain images from the sequence to make it shorter. It is also noted that during this period, a 'previously on The Bill segment was aired before the title sequence, to inform views what had occurred in the last episode.|$|E

500|$|St-Pierre's trainer Greg Jackson {{denied any}} wrongdoing, stating that Nurse was rubbing and <b>tapping</b> <b>on</b> St-Pierre's body {{as part of}} a drill to aid in his {{breathing}} techniques. [...] Jackson said that any Vaseline transferred from residue on Nurse's fingers was accidental and wiped off when pointed out. [...] Georges St-Pierre spoke to Sports Illustrated with regard to the controversy stating, [...] "I haven't seen the fight yet, but I remember at some point something happened and the athletic commission was complaining. [...] They used a towel to wet my back and wipe it off. [...] I don't mind. [...] I didn't put Vaseline on myself and I'm not a cheater." [...] However, St-Pierre offered Penn a rematch in the summer that Penn verbally accepted but is unlikely to happen due to the fact they have both since been scheduled for title defenses.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the release}} of Vol. 3, band members had promised a more {{experimental}} album; drummer Jordison said that [...] "it's almost as if Slayer was <b>tapping</b> <b>on</b> Radiohead". For {{the first time in}} Slipknot's career, songs such as [...] "Circle" [...] and [...] "Vermilion Pt. 2" [...] were led by an acoustic rather than an electric guitar. According to Todd Burns of Stylus, songs such as [...] "Pulse of the Maggots" [...] and [...] "Before I Forget" [...] incorporate a [...] "pounding metal" [...] style. AllMusic wrote that tracks, such as [...] "The Blister Exists", [...] "Three Nil", and [...] "Opium of the People", combine the two extremes of their recognizable metal edge with melody, and the most apparent shifts being in Taylor's vocal style, with relatively few songs relying solely on screamed vocals in comparison to their earlier work. Entertainment Weekly wrote that the album [...] " [...] between over-powering speed-metal and haunting acoustic rock".|$|E
500|$|Percussive {{effects in}} {{imitation}} of drumming had been introduced to bowed-string instruments by early in the 17th century. The earliest known use of col legno (<b>tapping</b> <b>on</b> the strings {{with the back of}} the bow) is found in Tobias Hume's First Part of Ayres for unaccompanied viola da gamba (1605), in a piece titled Harke, Harke. Carlo Farina, an Italian violinist active in Germany, also used col legno to mimic the sound of a drum in his Capriccio stravagante for four stringed instruments (1627), where he also used devices such as glissando, tremolo, pizzicato, and sul ponticello to imitate the noises of barnyard animals (cat, dog, chicken). Later in the century, Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber, in certain movements of Battalia (1673), added to these effects the device of placing a sheet of paper under the A string of the double bass, in order to imitate the dry rattle of a snare drum, and in [...] "Die liederliche Gesellschaft von allerley Humor" [...] from the same programmatic battle piece, superimposed eight different melodies in different keys, producing in places dense orchestral clusters. He also uses the percussive snap of fortissimo pizzicato to represent gunshots.|$|E

500|$|The G2 was {{considered}} by critics to be well-built, but {{was criticized for}} replacing the glass-based construction of the Optimus G with a plainer, plastic-based design, drawing comparisons to recent Samsung products. Ars Technica further criticized the Verizon Wireless version for having a cheaper appearance than the international versions, with a plainer rear cover, modified buttons, and a different speaker layout. The G2's rear buttons were met with equally mixed reception, with most reviewers believing that users {{would be able to}} adjust themselves to operate them. Accordingly, the ability to wake the phone by <b>tapping</b> <b>on</b> the screen {{was considered}} a more convenient method. The G2 was praised for its high-end hardware, with Engadget describing the device as a [...] "beast" [...] with specifications that [...] "seem familiar to anyone who's read a flagship Android phone review in the last 12 months", recognizing that it had become harder for manufacturers to differentiate their flagship products beyond displays and processors. The G2's display was praised for its high resolution and color accuracy, along with LG's efforts to reduce the screen bezel size. The G2 was also praised for having unexpectedly longer battery life than any of its competitors (along with Motorola's Droid Razr Maxx). After lasting about 20 hours of [...] "standard" [...] use in its testing, the G2's battery was considered by Engadget to be [...] "a sign that we're finally crossing into a world of sensible smartphone batteries." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tap tap buses are colorfully painted buses or pick-up {{trucks that}} serve as share taxis. The [...] "tap tap" [...] name comes {{from the sound of}} {{passengers}} <b>tapping</b> <b>on</b> the metal bus body to indicate they want off. These vehicles for hire are often privately owned and extensively decorated. They follow fixed routes, do not leave until filled with passengers, and riders can usually disembark at any point.

2500|$|The BBC had an {{echo chamber}} in the studio, which was greatly {{utilised}} during the episodes.

2500|$|In early April 2005, Phoenix {{checked into}} rehab {{to be treated}} for alcoholism. On January 26, 2006, while driving down a winding canyon road in Hollywood, Phoenix ran {{off the road and}} rolled his car. The crash was {{reportedly}} caused by brake failure.

Phoenix then realized that the man was famed German film director Werner Herzog. While Herzog helped Phoenix out of the wreckage by breaking the back window of the car, bystanders phoned for an ambulance. Phoenix approached Herzog to express gratitude, but Herzog downplayed his heroism and returned to his home nearby.|$|E
