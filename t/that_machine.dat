5|$|Plucking: Tea {{leaves and}} flushes, which {{includes}} a terminal bud and two young leaves, are picked from Camellia sinensis bushes typically twice a year during early {{spring and early summer}} or late spring. Autumn or winter pickings of tea flushes are much less common, though they occur when climate permits. Picking is done by hand when a higher quality tea is needed, or where labour costs are not prohibitive. Depending on the skill of the picker, hand-picking is performed by pulling the flush with a snap of the forearm, arm, or even the shoulders, with the picker grasping the tea shoot using the thumb and forefinger, with the middle finger sometimes used in combination. Tea flushes and leaves can also be picked by machine, though there will be more broken leaves and partial flushes reducing the quality of the tea. However, it has also been shown <b>that</b> <b>machine</b> plucking in correctly timed harvesting periods can produce good leaves for the production of high quality teas.|$|E

In {{a recent interview}} conducted with Phil Demmel, he revealed that with Machine Head's upcoming touring commitments, the band would not have chance to write a follow up album until at least 2010, for an expected 2011 release date. Machine Head toured with The Sword in Metallica's World Magnetic Tour for the Death Magnetic album from 2008 to 2009. Machine Head also opened for Megadeth, Slayer and Suicide Silence on the Canadian Carnage tour in late June. Machine Head reportedly cancelled their appearance at Sonisphere Festival in the UK because they had disagreements with the staff over their slot. They thought they should play after Limp Bizkit. However, {{a week before the}} Sonisphere festival took place on August 1 and 2, Machine Head agreed to take back their slot below Limp Bizkit. Their appearance was kept secret until the day they played. In August 2009, they won the Inspiration Award at the 2009 Kerrang! Awards. It {{was announced}} on the August 31 <b>that</b> <b>Machine</b> Head would tour through Europe and UK in 2010 with Hatebreed, Bleeding Through, and All Shall Perish in what will be known as [...] "The Black Procession", as well as adding dates for an Australian and New Zealand tour cycle in March. This will be the last time the band tour in support of The Blackening before writing the next album, as Dave McClain described in an interview, before their Belfast show in Northern Ireland.|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Victor Argonov has {{suggested}} a non-Turing test for machine consciousness based on machine's {{ability to produce}} philosophical judgments. He argues that a deterministic machine must be regarded as conscious if {{it is able to}} produces judgments on all problematic properties of consciousness (such as qualia or binding) having no innate (preloaded) philosophical knowledge on these issues, no philosophical discussions while learning, and no informational models of other creatures in its memory (such models may implicitly or explicitly contain knowledge about these creatures’ consciousness).

500|$|According to Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, [...] "The Power of Good-Bye" [...] {{begins with a}} four-chord {{arpeggio}} sequence. It has [...] "catchy" [...] melody phrases during the verses and a synth trumpet {{at the end of}} the first chorus, as well as Armstrong's strings present in the background. It also contains sustained notes on the instrumental sections, a characteristic for the songs on Ray of Light. Doubled acoustic guitar chords give an organic vibe during the beginning of the second verse, following a brief coda. The song also infuses computer blips and techno effect sounds, which Orbit achieved by using a Korg MS-20 analog synthesizer.

500|$|The song [...] "All Hands on the Bad One" [...] {{features}} guitar riffs {{that are}} reminiscent of the band's second album, Call the Doctor. It {{was chosen as the}} title track because, according to guitarist Carrie Brownstein, it is the song that best represents the sentiment of the album. Brownstein explained that the song deals with [...] "your relationship to evil and your relationship to the hypocrisy of forcing a morality on someone else when you yourself are no better." [...] She added, [...] "'Ballad of the Ladyman', for instance—who is 'the ladyman'? Is the person that wants to be on the radio, 'the bad one,' or is it the fans assuming that they [...] {{want to be on the}} radio—are they 'the bad one'?
