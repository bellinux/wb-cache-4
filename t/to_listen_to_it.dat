At the time, Moby planned on making the album his last before ending his career. When he finished recording, {{there was no sign}} that the album would perform any differently than Animal Rights. According to Moby, he shopped the record to every major label (from Warner Bros. to Sony to RCA) and was rejected every time. After V2 finally picked it up, his publicist sent the record to journalists, many of whom declined <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> According to manager Eric Härle in an interview with HitQuarters, their original goal was to sell 250,000 copies, which was what Everything Is Wrong, Moby's biggest-selling album at the time, had sold.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{agreed that}} this album {{represents}} a more [...] "mature" [...] Blink-182, hence {{the absence of}} songs with toilet humour or jokes for which the band had been known. [...] "We wanted to be different," [...] remarked DeLonge. [...] "Some of our fans were probably like, 'Fuck, maybe they should stop joking so people could hear why I like this band.' And I think this record {{is going to help}} those kids out.". In an interview with MTV Album Launch, Hoppus said that the desired effect of the album was for people <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> and say, [...] "Wait a minute...that's Blink-182?"

The inclusion of Freshlyground, a South African Afro-fusion band, on the track came to take place after Hill met with their producer in New York. The band were finishing their studio album Radio Africa when Hill approached them requesting for input regarding the song. The producer left the band alone to make additions to the track and returned hours later <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> Giving little reaction after hearing it, Hill expressed interest in recording [...] "everything I'd heard here" [...] and told the band that they would hear from him later.|$|E

[...] While Dan Rankin of Blare Magazine said the album was [...] "essentially just another fat kid on the already rusty trampoline that is this genre." [...] Brooke Daly of Tastemakers said that the album {{was one of the}} band's [...] "more solid releases" [...] with less repetition than on Homesick. Despite [...] "taking on a poppier sound" [...] being risky in his opinion, the band managed to [...] "pull it off".

500|$|For the album, {{the band}} {{wanted to create}} the {{atmosphere}} of hyperactivity they knew [...] their fans wanted. They wrote a few songs, but felt the songs [...] "weren't strong enough" [...] {{and sent them to}} other musicians. Shay Haley, a member of the band, explained that in their new work, the band wanted to add energy to the emotional appeal of their past albums, though the band did not conceive a clear plan for the direction of the new album. N.E.R.D described the desired outcomes of [...] the album as [...] "a pre-cognitive effort to make music that would make sense for us on while we're on a stage and to recapture that feeling we love so much" [...] and additionally, [...] "to make something that was thought provoking and for people <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> and enjoy it on their own time".|$|E
500|$|As The Primitives, Tweedy and Farrar {{were highly}} {{influenced}} by punk bands such as The Ramones and The Sex Pistols. However, {{they began to}} listen to country music because punk rock was not well received in the Belleville and St. Louis music scenes. While they originally were introduced to country by their parents, it wasn't until this time that they began <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> for leisure. Farrar typically wrote songs about Middle America, while Tweedy wrote about more mainstream topics such as relationships. Farrar took influence from authors such as Kurt Vonnegut and Jack Kerouac, whom he read while working at his mother's bookstore. As the lead singer of Uncle Tupelo, Farrar's lyrics would be front-and-center during performances, but the band's musical style was mostly driven by Tweedy and Heidorn (seen in the music's Minutemen-influenced start-stop arrangement). Jeff Tweedy {{said in an interview}} with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch: ...|$|E

[...] "When I played it for Madonna she went crazy, and knew instantly it was a song for her and that she could make a great record out of it," [...] Ostin recalled.

500|$|After their {{performance}} opening for Korn at the Dragonfly in Hollywood was well received, Limp Bizkit signed with Mojo, {{a subsidiary of}} MCA Records. While heading to California to record their first album, the band wrecked their van. As {{a result of the}} near death experience, Durst made amends with Borland, who rejoined the band. After a dispute with Mojo, Limp Bizkit signed with Flip, a subsidiary of Interscope Records. Arvizu persuaded Ross Robinson to listen to the demo. Robinson neglected <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> until it was appraised by his girlfriend. Impressed by the band's motivation and sound, Robinson produced Limp Bizkit's debut, which was recorded at Indigo Ranch. Durst's problems with his girlfriend inspired him to write the song [...] "Sour". The mood and tone set by Robinson in the studio allowed the band to improvise; a recording of the band improvising appeared as the last track on the album, [...] "Everything".|$|E
500|$|In one scene, Viswanathan asks Chellappa {{to tell a}} story, {{promising}} to finance his film if he is impressed.

500|$|In the mid-1950s, {{there was}} a revival in the United Kingdom of the musical form [...] "skiffle" [...] that had {{originated}} in the United States and had been popular in the US in the 1920s, '30s and '40s. [...] In addition to its popularity among British teenagers as music <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to,</b> <b>it</b> also spawned a craze of teenage boys starting their own groups to perform the music. One of the primary attractions was {{that it did not}} require great musical skills or expensive instruments to be played. Early British skiffle was played by traditional jazz musicians, with the most successful British proponent of the genre in the 1950s being Lonnie Donegan. The Quarrymen's initial repertoire included several songs that Donegan had recorded. When Lennon wanted to try making music himself, he and fellow Quarry Bank school friend, Griffiths, took guitar lessons in Hunt's Cross, Liverpool, although Lennon gave up the lessons soon after, as they were based on theory and not actual playing.|$|E
500|$|The group's primary musical {{influences}} {{came from}} bands such as Buzzcocks, The Jam, Madness and The Kinks. Supergrass took this contemporary music and mixed it with pop punk's characteristic fast, three-chord, guitar-based, catchy tunes {{to produce a}} sound uniquely their own; [...] "we were just {{the three of us}} in my bedroom or someone's house, just making... we played really hard and just made loads of noise. Most of our early songs were just three chord grooves and stuff that was fun to play. So that's why the first album sounded so 'punky', I think... it's just 'cause we were all used to playing in this small room and it being really loud, so we just made the album sound like that." [...] Songs for Beginners by Graham Nash was another possible influence on I Should Coco. Gaz Coombes told The Guardian in 2003, [...] "We used <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> a lot when we lived in Cowley Road in Oxford in 1994, just when the band were getting big." ...|$|E
500|$|One of the {{simplest}} methods of assessing the heart's condition is <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> using a stethoscope. Typically, healthy hearts have only two audible heart sounds, called S1 and S2. The first heart sound S1, is the sound created by {{the closing of the}} atrioventricular valves during ventricular contraction and is normally described as [...] "lub". The second heart sound, S2, is the sound of the semilunar valves closing during ventricular diastole and is described as [...] "dub". Each sound consists of two components, reflecting the slight difference in time as the two valves close. S2 may split into two distinct sounds, either as a result of inspiration or different valvular or cardiac problems. Additional heart sounds may also be present and these give rise to gallop rhythms. A third heart sound, S3 usually indicates an increase in ventricular blood volume. A fourth heart sound S4 is referred to as an atrial gallop and is produced by the sound of blood being forced into a stiff ventricle. The combined presence of S3 and S4 give a quadruple gallop.|$|E

500|$|During {{recording}} {{there was}} pressure from I.R.S. Records {{to try to}} make the album more commercial. The label sent messages to Dixon and Easter, which the producers told the band that they would ignore. While the producers respected I.R.S. president Jay Boberg, they expressed dismay at the comments he made when he visited during the last day of sessions. Dixon called Boberg [...] "record company clueless", while Easter said [...] "I got along with Jay Boberg OK [...] but now and again he would express an opinion that would make me think, 'holy shit', because it would strike me as really teenage." [...] Buck said he was grateful that Dixon and Easter acted as a buffer between the band and its label. He said that [...] "it got to the point where as much as I respected the guys at I.R.S., we basically tried to record the records so they wouldn't know we were recording them!", and explained that part of the reason why R.E.M. recorded the album so quickly was that the group wanted to finish before representatives from I.R.S. showed up <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} recorded by Roberts and Tikovoi. However, the pair struggled to finish its production, with Roberts describing {{the process as}} something that [...] "just wouldn't work". The incompletion of the song led to stress and illness for Roberts, and she decided to contact producer Diplo {{to work on the}} record. Discussing her choice in an interview for The Guardian, Roberts said that she only had one chance to get him to work with her and asked for his assistance. After Diplo reassured the singer that he would help, Roberts revealed that the situation was no longer in her hands and that she would wait for him to contact her with some progress. Despite her worries, she felt that [...] "he just got it straight away". Communications were limited between the pair, but when Roberts received Diplo's finished production, she was too nervous <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> immediately. Instead, she burnt the track to a CD, and drove to a deserted field with her younger brother and sister, where she played the song loudly. After positive responses from her siblings, Roberts declared Diplo a [...] "genius".|$|E

The tape is labeled as a message from mother to daughter. Rachel refuses to listen to the tape, stating that she is not ready. Jesse later meets with Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel), the coach of Vocal Adrenaline, who reveals that she is Rachel's biological mother, but a contractual agreement with Rachel's two fathers prevents her from meeting with Rachel until Rachel is 18. Jesse reveals that though he had [...] "befriended" [...] Rachel just to get more acting practice, he had actually started liking her. She implores Jesse to convince Rachel to listen to the tape. Back at Rachel's house, Jesse starts the tape playing as Rachel enters her bedroom, then leaves her <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> On the tape, Shelby sings [...] "I Dreamed a Dream", leading to a duet with Rachel in a dream sequence, ending with Rachel back in her room in tears.|$|E

Christine Sams from The Sydney Morning Herald {{wrote that the}} album [...] "Is an upbeat pop start to this album with Any Other Way and Carr's single, Feels Like Woah (with its touch of Bryan Adams) but it then veers into more gentle, playful territory with Hurricanes (delightful, with a distinct Jack Johnson feel). Further on, Light Years seems {{to come out of}} left field - dark and introspective. The mix keeps things interesting, with Carr emerging as a strong voice." [...] She went on to give the album 8/10. Oz Music Scene stated that [...] "Even the missteps are enjoyable <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to.</b> <b>It’s</b> just that when Wes gets it right, he sets the bar so high.
