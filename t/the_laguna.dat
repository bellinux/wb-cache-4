5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Laguna</b> Canyon area {{supports}} {{a variety of}} native Southern California wildlife, including large mammals such as mountain lions, bobcats, coyotes and mule deer. Like Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park to the south, the canyon supports over one hundred species of birds. Some of its endangered species include California gnatcatcher, cactus wren, and orange-throated whiptail. Except for <b>the</b> <b>Laguna</b> Lakes, the canyon has no fish habitat, and riparian habitat is sparse because the local creeks have only seasonal flow.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Laguna</b> del Maule lake is not {{the only}} lake in the field. The other lakes are Laguna Cari Launa on the Chilean side in the northeastern sector of the field, and Laguna Fea in the south and Laguna Negra lake both on the Argentine side. <b>The</b> <b>Laguna</b> Sin Salida (so named because it lacks a river running out of it) is in the northeastern sector of the {{volcanic}} field and it formed within a glacial cirque.|$|E

5|$|As it {{continues}} through <b>the</b> <b>Laguna</b> Coast Wilderness Park, SR 133 follows a four-lane alignment {{on the west}} side of the canyon, moved from the old two-lane road in the center of the canyon in late 2006. Laguna Canyon Road splits to the northwest where the canyon ends in Irvine. North of the park, the highway becomes <b>the</b> <b>Laguna</b> Freeway after crossing an at-grade intersection with Laguna Canyon Road, followed by an interchange at exit 8, San Diego Freeway (I-405). SR 133 then continues as a freeway and serves Barranca Parkway and the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5). After crossing I-5, SR 133 becomes part of the Eastern Toll Road along the northwest side of Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, crossing an interchange with Irvine Boulevard at exit 12 before ending at SR 241.|$|E
5|$|State Route 133, locally called Laguna Canyon Road, {{winds through}} Laguna Canyon {{for the entire}} length of the gorge. California State Route 73 bisects the gorge east-west. The lower section of the canyon is part of <b>the</b> <b>Laguna</b> Coast Wilderness, while the upper section also has a few smaller {{wilderness}} preserves. The upper section contains <b>the</b> <b>Laguna</b> Lakes, a series of small natural lakes formed by groundwater rising along a local fault line, which are the namesake of the canyon. A section of the lower canyon within the city limits of Laguna Beach is heavily developed. The northernmost extreme of the canyon lies near a residential area that adjoins Interstate 405.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Laguna</b> Madre {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} and unspoiled lagoon ecosystems in Texas. It is also one of the most protected in the United States; 75% of its shores are protected by <b>the</b> <b>Laguna</b> Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge to the west and the Padre Island National Seashore on the east. Fish, shrimp and crab, which feed the bird populations, depend on the lagoon and its plentiful beds of seagrass for survival. The seagrass of Laguna Madre accounts for 80% of all seagrass found off the Texas Coast; however, it is threatened by brown tides caused by poor circulation and dredging. An influx of seawater can sometimes replace the vital seagrass with oyster beds.|$|E

50|$|Kichwa is {{the variety}} of the Quechua {{language}} spoken in Ecuador {{and is one of}} the most widely spoken indigenous languages in South America. Despite this fact, Kichwa is a threatened language, mainly because of the expansion of Spanish in South America. One community of original Kichwa speakers, Lagunas, was one of the first indigenous communities to switch to the Spanish language. According to King, this was because of the increase of trade and business with the large Spanish-speaking town nearby. <b>The</b> <b>Lagunas</b> people assert that it was not for cultural assimilation purposes, as they value their cultural identity highly. However, once this contact was made, language for <b>the</b> <b>Lagunas</b> people shifted through generations, to Kichwa and Spanish bilingualism and now is essentially Spanish monolingualism. The feelings of <b>the</b> <b>Lagunas</b> people present a dichotomy with language use, as most of <b>the</b> <b>Lagunas</b> members speak Spanish exclusively and only know a few words in Kichwa.|$|R

5|$|The tourism {{industry}} {{is also a}} mainstay for communities on the lagoon. Beach-goers must pass <b>the</b> <b>Laguna</b> Madre to reach the prime beaching destination at both North and South Padre Islands. Fishing has drawn tourists to Port Isabel, where the Texas International Fishing Tournament has been held since 1934. Visitors also flock to Bird Island off the western coast of Padre Island, for windsurfing, kayaking, and other water sports.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of its}} {{construction}} of concrete roads, started by a 1913 bond issue, Orange County paved the county road through Laguna Canyon, connecting State Highway Route 2 (the forerunner of U.S. Hwy. 101 and I-5) at Irvine with Laguna Beach, by 1917. The road {{was added to the}} state highway system in 1933 as Route 185, an unsigned designation. The entire route was added to the new California Freeway and Expressway System in 1959; the planned upgrade had already been named <b>the</b> <b>Laguna</b> Freeway by the California Highway Commission on November 26, 1957. The highway received a sign route numberState Route 133in the 1964 renumbering.|$|E

5|$|Geologically, {{the canyon}} likely {{originated}} {{millions of years}} ago as the result of San Diego Creek cutting through the San Joaquin Hills. Uplift diverted that stream to its present course, leaving Laguna Canyon as a wind gap. California State Route 133 runs {{the entire length of the}} canyon connecting Laguna Beach and Irvine, while California State Route 73 crosses it, running southeast-northwest. A majority of the canyon is located within <b>the</b> <b>Laguna</b> Coast Wilderness Park; small portions are part of Aliso and Wood Canyons Wilderness Park and the cities of Irvine, Laguna Beach, Laguna Woods and Aliso Viejo.|$|E
5|$|Opening of the firstand onlypiece of <b>the</b> <b>Laguna</b> Freeway {{was celebrated}} in Laguna Beach on October 1, 1952, {{connecting}} {{the north end}} of Laguna Canyon with a planned extension of the Santa Ana Freeway at a trumpet interchange and bypassing the old route on Sand Canyon Avenue. There were initially no other interchanges along the route. The state decided not to build the remainder of the freeway in late 1975, and in 1996 the portion south of SR 73 was removed from the Freeway and Expressway System. Widening of the part north of SR 73 to a four-lane expressway was completed in late 2006, moving the road out of the canyon bottom and allowing better access to areas in Laguna Coast Wilderness Park.|$|E
5|$|Ruffin's and Leval's {{divisions}} fled towards <b>the</b> <b>Laguna</b> del Puerco, where Victor {{succeeded in}} halting their disorganised rout. The Marshal deployed {{two or three}} relatively unscathed battalions to cover the reorganisation of his forces and secure their retreat, but Graham had also managed to call his exhausted men to order and he brought them, with Duncan's artillery, against Victor's new position. Morale in the re-formed French ranks was fragile; when a squadron of KGL hussars rounded the Cerro and drove a squadron of French dragoons onto their infantry, the shock {{was too much to}} bear for the demoralised soldiers, who retreated in a sudden rush.|$|E

5|$|State Route 133 (SR 133) is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of California. It connects SR 1 in Laguna Beach through the San Joaquin Hills with several freeways in Irvine, ending at the SR 241 toll road in the latter city. It is built as an {{expressway}} from SR 73 to Laguna Canyon Road (just south of I-405 in Irvine). SR 133 is a freeway (<b>the</b> <b>Laguna</b> Freeway) to I-5, and a tollway (part of the Eastern Toll Road) to SR 241 near the Santa Ana Mountains.|$|E
5|$|The 15.3 to 7 mya old Campanario Formation forms {{much of the}} {{basement}} in <b>the</b> <b>Laguna</b> del Maule area. This geological formation contains andesitic-dacitic ignimbrites and tuffs with later dacitic dykes that were emplaced 3.6–2.0 mya. This formation is affected by various faults that extend in north-south direction. An older unit, of Jurassic-Cretaceous age, crops out northwest of the volcanic field. Other formations include an Oligocene-Miocene lacustrine formation named Cura-Mallín, and another intermediary formation named Trapa-Trapa. Trapa-Trapa is of volcanic origin and between 19 and 10 million years old. Remnants of Quaternary ignimbrites and Pliocene, early Quaternary volcanic centres, are also found around the field.|$|E

The Mission and Aransas Rivers are the main freshwater sources: small rivers with deep banks that carve through a landscape lined with hardwood trees. Their inflows increase during significant rainfall and reach their seasonal highs during the autumn. These rivers have not been dammed and thus flow free. At both mouths, marshes covering several square miles stretch from the confluences with Copano Bay and forming several saline lakes.|$|E
