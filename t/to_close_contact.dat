25|$|When the Confederate {{infantry}} {{cleared the}} Potomac River, accompanied or eventually joined by three other cavalry brigades, Stuart proceeded to ride through {{and around the}} Union Army in northern Virginia and central Maryland in order to harass and delay their movement, capture a wagon train of supplies, damage some communication and railroad property and to gather intelligence. Stuart's ride, which he could have abandoned early to allow return of his force <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>contact</b> with Lee's army, risked putting Stuart out of a position to provide timely intelligence and cavalry support to Lee. This risk was exposed as Stuart encountered several delays along the way. One of those delays {{was caused by the}} attack of the small Union cavalry force from the 11th New York Cavalry against Stuart's force of 2,000 men at Fairfax Court House on June 27, 1863. One of the more audacious actions by a small force against a much larger one during the war, the battle not only delayed Stuart's ride but cost the Confederates the life of the 1st North Carolina Cavalry's promising young commanding officer, Major John H. Whitaker. Stuart did not arrive at Gettysburg until the afternoon of {{the second day of the}} battle on July 2, 1863. Stuart's overall delay engendered considerable contemporary and future criticism and controversy concerning the value and conduct of his ride around the Union Army and its possible negative effect on the Confederate Army's operations and performance at Gettysburg.|$|E

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the quality of}} evidence {{for the use of}} erythromycin in preventing secondary transmission of pertussis <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>contacts</b> of primary cases. A literature search was undertaken and identified papers were reviewed critically. Thirteen original papers and 1 manuscript met the inclusion criteria for review (3 randomized controlled trials, 4 analytical studies and 7 descriptive studies). Evidence from both experimental and analytical studies showed little effect of the use of erythromycin in preventing secondary transmission. Its effect is at best modest when compared with the protection conferred by use of good quality whole cell vaccine. Three studies reported adverse events with erythromycin prophylaxis; these were mainly nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In countries where effective pertussis vaccines are in use, erythromycin use should be confined <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>contacts</b> of cases, particularly unimmunized children or partially immunized infants who would be most susceptible to the complications of pertussis, or adults who come into <b>close</b> <b>contact</b> with vulnerable children...|$|R

40|$|In early April 2003, severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome (SARS) {{was diagnosed}} in a Pennsylvania resident after his exposure to persons with SARS in Toronto, Canada. To identify contacts of the case-patient {{and evaluate the}} risk for SARS transmission, a detailed epidemiologic investigation was performed. On the basis of this investigation, 26 persons (17 healthcare workers, 4 household contacts, and 5 others) were identified as having had <b>close</b> <b>contact</b> with this case-patient before infection-control practices were implemented. Laboratory evaluation of clinical specimens showed no evidence of transmission of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection <b>to</b> any <b>close</b> <b>contact</b> of this patient.

50|$|Worker {{bees are}} the most {{susceptible}} to infection due to injection, {{as a result of}} laboratory tests and the most efficient mode for spread of infection is close contact between healthy and infected bees in crowded areas.

Therefore, this viral infection may spread between hives {{as a result of this}} indirect contact. As a result of laboratory experiments, adult bees may become infected with CBPV by a viral injection, topical application, or by ingestion.|$|E
50|$|The {{cultivation}} process involves {{removal of}} weeds, applying insecticides, covering the fruits with plastics to prevent loss due <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>contact,</b> also enclosing the bananas with plastic bags filled with insecticide, protecting plant stocks by covering them with strips of plastic coated with insecticide, removal {{of yellow and}} dead leaves, and providing support by propping up the plants with wooden stakes. The growth phases are monitored by tying coloured bands to the stalks. Thus, there are three stages of monitoring which are: harvesting fruit-laden stalks, transporting them to the packing plant, cutting the remaining stems after harvest.|$|E

50|$|Nepali, {{also called}} Gurkha, Gorkhali, Gurkhali, or Khaskura, is an Indo-Aryan {{language}} derived from Sanskrit. It {{is the official}} language and de facto lingua franca of Nepal. It is spoken chiefly by Pahari people in Nepal and by {{a significant number of}} Bhutanese and some Burmese people. In India, Nepali language is listed in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India as an Indian language having an official status in the Indian state of Sikkim and in West Bengal's Darjeeling district. Nepali developed in proximity to a number of Indo-Aryan languages, most notably the Pahari languages and Maithili, and shows Sanskrit influences. However, owing to Nepal's geographical area, it has also been influenced by Tibeto-Burman languages. Nepali is mainly differentiated from Central Pahari, both in grammar and vocabulary, by Tibeto-Burman idioms owing <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>contact</b> with the respective language group.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of {{sustained}} European contact in the 16th centuries and 17th centuries, the Lenape were a powerful Native American nation who inhabited a region on the mid-Atlantic coast spanning the latitudes of southern Massachusetts to the southern extent of Delaware in what anthropologists call the Northeastern Woodlands. Although never politically unified, the confederation of the Delaware roughly encompassed the area around and between the Delaware and lower Hudson rivers, and included {{the western part of}} Long Island in present-day New York. Some of their place names, such as Manhattan ("the island of many hills"), Raritan, and Tappan were adopted by Dutch and English colonists to identify the Lenape people that lived there. Based on the historical record of the mid-seventeenth century, {{it has been estimated that}} most Lenape polities consisted of several hundred people but it is conceivable that some had been considerably larger prior <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>contact,</b> given the wars between the Susquehannocks and the Iroquois, both of whom were armed by the Dutch fur traders, while the Lenape were at odds with the Dutch and so lost that particular arms race. Smallpox devastated native communities even located far from European settlements by the 1640s. The Lenape and Susquehannocks fought a war in the middle of the 17th century that left the Delaware a tributary state even as the Susquehannocks had defeated the Province of Maryland between 1642-50s.|$|E

50|$|Etruscan texts, {{written in}} a space of seven centuries, use a form of the Greek {{alphabet}} due <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>contact</b> between the Etruscans and the Greek colonies at Pithecusae and Cumae in the 8th century BC (until {{it was no longer}} used, {{at the beginning of the}} 1st century AD). Etruscan inscriptions disappeared from Chiusi, Perugia and Arezzo around this time. Only a few fragments survive, religious and especially funeral texts most of which are late (from the 4th century BC). In addition to the original texts that have survived to this day, we have a large number of quotations and allusions from classical authors. It should be noted that in the 1st century BC, Diodorus Siculus wrote that literary culture was one of the great achievements of the Etruscans. Little is known of it and even what is known of their language is due to the repetition of the same few words in the many inscriptions found (by way of the modern epitaphs) contrasted in bilingual or trilingual texts with Latin and Punic. Out of the aforementioned genres, is just one such Vorrio (Vorrius) cited in classical sources mention. With a few exceptions, such as the Liber Linteus, the only written records in the Etruscan language that remain are inscriptions, mainly funerary. The language is written in the Etruscan alphabet, a script related to the early Euboean Greek alphabet. Many thousand inscriptions in Etruscan are known, mostly epitaphs, and a few very short texts have survived, which are mainly religious. Etruscan imaginative literature is evidenced only in references by later Roman authors, but it is evident from their visual art that the Greek myths were well-known.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis article {{presents}} a new, highly sensitive method for {{the identification of}} single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in homogeneous solutions using fluorescently labeled hairpin-structured oligonucleotides (smart probes) and fluorescence single-molecule spectroscopy. While the hairpin probe is closed, fluorescence intensity is quenched due <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>contact</b> between the chromophore and several guanosine residues. Upon hybridization to the respective target SNP sequence, contact is lost and the fluorescence intensity increases significantly. High specificity is achieved by blocking sequences containing mismatch with unlabeled oligonucleotides. Time-resolved single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy enables the detection of individual smart probes passing a small detection volume. This method leads to a subnanomolar sensitivity for this single nucleotide specific DNA assay technique...|$|E
