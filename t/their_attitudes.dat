5|$|Australia's {{working class}} culture also {{influenced}} {{that of the}} AIF. Approximately three-quarters of AIF volunteers {{were members of the}} working class, with a high proportion also being trade unionists, and soldiers frequently applied <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> to industrial relations to the Army. Throughout the war there were incidents where soldiers refused to undertake tasks that they considered demeaning or protested against actual or perceived mistreatment by their officers. These actions were similar to the strikes many soldiers had taken part in during their pre-enlistment employment, with the men not seeing themselves as mutineers. The protests which occurred in 1918 over the planned disbandment of several battalions also used similar tactics to those employed in industrial disputes. Historian Nathan Wise has judged that the frequent use of industrial action in the AIF led to improved conditions for the soldiers, and contributed to it having a less strict military culture than was common in the British Army.|$|E
5|$|The Elizabethan Poor Law of 1601 formalized earlier {{practices}} of poor relief {{contained in the}} Act for the Relief of the Poor 1597 yet is often cited {{as the beginning of}} the Old Poor Law system. It created a system administered at parish level, paid for by levying local rates on rate payers. Relief for those too ill or old to work, the so-called 'impotent poor', was {{in the form of a}} payment or items of food ('the parish loaf') or clothing also known as outdoor relief. Some aged people might be accommodated in parish alms houses, though these were usually private charitable institutions. Meanwhile, able-bodied beggars who had refused work were often placed in Houses of Correction or even subjected to beatings to mend <b>their</b> <b>attitudes.</b> Provision for the many able-bodied poor in the workhouse, was relatively unusual, and most workhouses developed later. The 1601 Law said that parents and children were responsible for each other, elderly parents would live with their children.|$|E
5|$|The Home Army was {{intended}} to be representative of the Polish nation, its members being recruited from all parties and social classes (the only notable exception being communists sent by the Soviets, and the Soviet-created People's Army). The Home Army's growth was largely based on integrating, into its ranks, scores of smaller resistance organizations. Most other Polish underground armed organizations were incorporated into the Home Army (though they retained varying degrees of autonomy). The largest organization merged into the Home Army was the leftist Bataliony Chłopskie (Peasants' Battalions), about 1943-44. Parts of the Narodowe Siły Zbrojne (National Armed Forces) also came to be subordinated to the Home Army. As a result, individual Home Army units varied substantially in their political outlooks (notably in <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward ethnic minorities and toward the Soviets). The largest group that completely refused to join the Home Army was the pro-Soviet, communist People's Army, which at its height in 1944 numbered 30,000 people.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that people with a strong moral basis for <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> show stronger intentions to publicly act in line with <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> when they are led to believe they are in a minority as compared to a majority. The current paper examines whether this evidence for counter-conformity can be replicated on speaking-out behaviors as well as intentions. Participants were told that they were either in a minority or in a majority in terms of <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> toward a government apology to Australian Aborigines (Experiment 1 : N = 100) and legalizing voluntary euthanasia (Experiment 2 : N = 169). On intentions to speak out, participants with a strong moral basis for <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> counter-conformed, whereas those with a weak moral basis for <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> were not influenced by the group norm. On behaviors, however, evidence for counter-conformity disappeared. In Experiment 2, the influence of norms on both intentions and behaviors were moderated by perceptions of whether the status quo was likely or unlikely to change in line with participants 2 ̆ 7 attitudes. Results are discussed with reference to theory and research on normative influence...|$|R

25|$|In The Gestalt Theory of Motivation (1960), {{the social}} {{psychologist}} Daryl Bem proposed the self-perception theory whereby {{people do not}} think much about <b>their</b> <b>attitudes,</b> even when engaged in a conflict with another person. The Theory of Self-perception proposes that people develop attitudes by observing their own behaviour, and concludes that <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> caused the behaviour observed by self-perception; especially true when internal cues either are ambiguous or weak. Therefore, the person {{is in the same}} position as an observer who must rely upon external cues to infer his or her inner state of mind. Self-perception theory proposes that people adopt attitudes without access to their states of mood and cognition.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aim: Parents have an {{important}} role in making decisions about their child′s oral health. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine parental awareness of their children′s oral health maintenance and <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> toward dental treatment. Materials and Methods: Total 284 parents from different socioeconomic groups participated in the study. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire addressing various aspects of knowledge and attitude of parents toward oral health and treatment modalities. Results: Awareness among parents was significantly lower in low socioeconomic group. <b>Their</b> <b>attitude</b> toward dental treatment differed significantly in which only 53 % parents from high socioeconomic group preferred going to the pediatric dentist. Conclusion: The level of awareness among parents is relatively low and there is need for the implementation of oral health awareness programs for parents to change <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> toward dental treatment of their children...|$|R

25|$|Medicine in the Middle Ages had {{its roots}} in pagan and folk practices. This {{influence}} was highlighted by the interplay between Christian theologians who adopted aspects of pagan and folk practices and chronicled them in their own works. The practices adopted by Christian medical practitioners around the 2nd century, and <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward pagan and folk traditions, reflected an understanding of these practices, especially humoralism and herbalism. The practices of Christian medicine stemmed from these pagan and folk practices.|$|E

25|$|In August 1943 and March 1944, the Underground State {{announced}} its long-term plan, partially designed {{to counter the}} attractiveness {{of some of the}} communist proposals. It promised parliamentary democracy, land reform, nationalization of the industrial base, more powerful trade unions, demands for territorial compensation from Germany, and re-establishment of the pre-1939 eastern border. Thus, the main difference between the Underground State and the communists, in terms of politics, amounted not to radical economic and social reforms, which were advocated by both sides, but to <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards national sovereignty, borders, and Polish-Soviet relations.|$|E

A convention the following year proposed that Texas become a separate Mexican state.

Recreational groups represented on the council, such as Ducks Unlimited and Bow Waters Canoe Club, expressed concern for the river's environment. <b>Their</b> <b>attitudes</b> were not strictly human-centric, but, like those favoring a park system in Calgary, they defined the Bow River's environment as something worth preserving for human use.|$|E
