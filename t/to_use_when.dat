Guidelines differ as to which dose <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>when</b> blood sugar levels start falling; some recommend reducing the dose of insulin once glucose falls below 16.6mmol/l (300mg/dl) but other recommend infusing glucose in addition to saline to allow for ongoing infusion of higher doses of insulin.|$|E

For his portrayals of Black and his Mysteron masters, Gray's voice was electronically deepened, by running the tape at high speed whilst he was recording his lines and playing it back at normal speed, to produce a haunting effect.|$|E
5|$|In {{professional}} wrestling, some wrestlers use {{the soccer}} kick is as a finishing move. A number of professional wrestlers {{prior to the}} 1980s professional wrestling boom were taught to use wrestling moves and strikes legitimately. This {{was due to the}} likelihood of attacks on the wrestlers from fans. This included the soccer kick, which former pro-wrestler, CM Punk stated was the easiest tactic <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>when</b> a fan tried to get in the ring to confront a wrestler. High profile users of soccer kicks as a finishing move includes Katsuyori Shibata, and Randy Orton. In Japan within a 1977 puroresu match between Antonio Inoki and Great Antonio, Inoki started to shoot on Great Antonio after Great Antonio refused to sell Inoki's offence. Inoki used a takedown on Great Antonio and then used soccer kicks and head stomps to legitimately knock out Great Antonio.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{stirrups}} {{come in a}} {{wide variety}} of styles, sizes and materials and are attached to most saddles by means of adjustable stirrup leathers, which can be altered in length to fit both the size of the rider and the need to remain over the horse's optimal center of balance for a given equestrianism discipline. There are safety concerns associated with the use of stirrups, including a risk that a fallen rider may get their foot caught in the stirrup and be dragged by the horse, or that long hours of use without rest may cause problems in the human foot's Peroneus Tertius tendon. Stirrups are safer <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>when</b> riding boots are worn, and proper sizing and placement of the foot on the stirrup increases both safety and usability.|$|E
