40|$|Woody {{vegetation}} encroachment {{has become}} a major threat to tallgrass prairie streams mainly because of fire suppression. This process converts prairie streams from open to closed canopy systems. The effects of these riparian changes are poorly understood, but the relative importance of basal resources presumably shifts from primarily autochthonous to allochthonous with increasing canopy cover, potentially altering macroinvertebrate functional structure and production. To assess the effects of woody vegetation encroachment on stream ecosystem structure and function, riparian trees were removed from two headwater stream reaches on the Konza Prairie Biological Station (KPBS) in eastern Kansas. Experimental stream reaches were compared to streams with naturally open and closed canopies before and after the manipulation. Benthic organic matter and macroinvertebrates were collected monthly from each reach for one year before and one year after woody vegetation removal. <b>Total</b> <b>community</b> <b>production</b> in canopy removal reaches ranged from 8. 9 - 10. 2 g AFDM m- 2 y- 1 before riparian removal, and this increased significantly to 13. 4 - 14. 5 g AFDM m- 2 y- 1 after riparian removal. Scraper production in canopy removal reaches was 2. 8 - 3. 9 g AFDM m- 2 y- 1 before riparian removal, and increased significantly to 6. 0 - 8. 7 g AFDM m- 2 y- 1 after riparian removal, presumably due to enhanced food availability. <b>Total</b> <b>community</b> <b>production</b> in naturally open reaches ranged from 7. 6 - 12. 6 g AFDM m- 2 y- 1 before riparian removal and decreased to 6. 5 - 9. 8 g AFDM m- 2 y- 1 after riparian removal. Riparian forest removal altered macroinvertebrate production and functional structure, but higher macroinvertebrate production in canopy removal reaches compared to naturally open reaches suggested natural conditions were not restored one year after riparian removal. However, macroinvertebrate communities in naturally open and canopy removal reaches became more similar after riparian removal. Functional structure, based on production, in naturally open and canopy removal reaches after riparian removal was dominated by scrapers (45 - 60...|$|E
40|$|The {{complexity}} and scale of Biosphere 2 under materially closed conditions represented {{a unique opportunity}} to investigate couplings between elemental cycles and community metabolism. For this paper, simulation models were developed to explore individual biome effects on atmospheric composition and carbon cycling inside the enclosure. Results suggest soil respiration rates, light intensity, and acid–base equilibrium control atmospheric carbon dioxide and oxygen under materially closed conditions. Experiments with the overall Combined Biome model indicate: (1) the agriculture biome has a greater effect on atmo-spheric composition than the other biomes due to its large area, high net productivity, and biomass harvests; (2) the rainforest, which occupies: 20 % of Biosphere 2 area, may be responsible for 50 % of <b>total</b> <b>community</b> <b>production</b> and respiration of oxygen; (3) the savannah and wetland biomes may be sources of carbon dioxide in the long term; (4) the ocean biome has less effect on atmospheric composition than the terrestrial biomes; and (5) the desert biome may lower carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as much as 2000 ppm during low light. Diurnal curve analyses of oxygen and carbon dioxide from early 1995 produced an average community gross production rate of 23 g O 2 :m 2 per day, a community respiration rate of 25 g O 2 :m 2 per day, and an average carbon dioxide absorption rate of 0. 2 g CO 2 :...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} obtaining in situ {{growth rates of}} larval Chironomidae (Diptera) and its {{application}} to studies of secondary production’ Abstract-Methods and growth chambers are described which permit in situ estimates of the growth rates of chironomid larvae inhabiting litter accumulations in lotic habitats. Instantaneous growth rates (IGRs) for larvae of different sizes ranged from 0. 01 to 0. 24 mg mg-l ash-free dry mass (AFDM) d-l at stream temperatures of 2. 9 ”- 15. 1 ”C. IGRs were significantly and linearly related to temperature. Regression equations relating IGRs and temperature, combined with fieldderived data for chironomid standing stock and stream temperature, enabled calculation of the production of chironomids inhabiting litter accumulations (15 -g DM litter bags) in a temperate mountain stream. The annual production per litter bag was about 224 mg AFDM yr- 1 and the annual P:B was 42, indicating rapid turnover of chironomid biomass. The annual production of chironomids exceeded the mean standing crop biomass of all macroinvertebrates by 4. 6 x. The recognition of secondary production {{as a means of}} quantifying the influence of stream-dwelling invertebrates on ecosystem processes (Benke and Wallace 1980; Parker and Voshell 1983; Fisher and Gray 1983) has resulted in the compilation of a considerable volume of literature (Benke 1984). Most secondary production estimates have been restricted to relatively large organisms with semi-, bi-, or univoltine life cycles which are amenable to the size-frequency and various cohort methods of measurement (Waters 1977; Benke 1984). However, benthic invertebrates with low standing stock biomass, short generation times, and overlapping cohorts (e. g. Chironomidae) may have high annual P: B ratios (P: B = production: 2 standing stock biomass) and may contribute substantially to <b>total</b> <b>community</b> secondary <b>production</b> (Macke...|$|R
40|$|Nineteen hyperthermophilic heterotrophs from deep-sea {{hydrothermal}} vents, {{plus the}} control organism Pyrococcus furiosus, were examined {{for their ability}} to grow and produce H 2 on maltose, cellobiose, and peptides and for the presence of the genes encoding proteins that hydrolyze starch and cellulose. All of the strains grew on these disaccharides and peptides and converted maltose and peptides to H 2 even when elemental sulfur was present as a terminal electron acceptor. Half of the strains had at least one gene for an extracellular starch hydrolase, but only P. furiosus had a gene for an extracellular β- 1, 4 -endoglucanase. P. furiosus was serially adapted for growth on CF 11 cellulose and H 2 production, which is the first reported instance of hyperthermophilic growth on cellulose, with a doubling time of 64 min. Cell-specific H 2 production rates were 29 fmol, 37 fmol, and 54 fmol of H 2 produced cell− 1 doubling− 1 on α- 1, 4 -linked sugars, β- 1, 4 -linked sugars, and peptides, respectively. The highest <b>total</b> <b>community</b> H 2 <b>production</b> rate came from growth on starch (2. 6 mM H 2 produced h− 1).

40|$|A wave-exposed sea stack and a {{protected}} boulder beach at Cayucos Point, California, were compared {{in terms of}} their intertidal biota on 17 - 18 February 1973. The major differences between the two sites appear to be due largely to differences in the shearing forces of waves and habitat structure. The mosaic of crevices, rivulets, and angled substrates in conjunction with a broad gradual slope and reduced wave action at the boulder beach habitat resulted in a predominance of macrophytes and a zonational pattern related to both horizontal location on the shore and vertical tidal level, while sessile macroinvertebrates with zonal patterns closely correlated to tidal height dominated the sea stack. Upward shifts in comparable vertical zones at the sea stack were clearly correlated with increased wetting higher on the shore due to waves and splash, in agreement with similar findings by other workers. The most abundant macrophytes at both sites were blue-green algae and Endocladia muricata,-althoughtheotherabundant. speciesweredifferentat-each site. Eive sessile macroinvertebrates (Mytilus californianus, Chthamalus fissus, C. dalli, Balanus (Balanus) glandula, and Pollicipes polymerus) dominated the sea stack, while only three sessile speci((s (Anthopleura elegantissima, C. fissus, and C. dalll) were prevalent on the boulder beach. Of the mobile macroinvertebrates, Tegulafunebralis was the most numerous species at the boulder beach whereas the limpets Acmaea (Collisella) scabra and A. (Collisella) digitalis occurred most abundantly on the sea stack. Although a greater number of taxa and higher species richness values were recorded at the boulder beach, the evenness index and Shannon's index indicated a higher diversity on the sea stack. At the boulder beach, 12 species assemblages were defined by cluster analysis, while only 6 such groups were identified on the sea stack. The boulder beach macrophytes contributed approximately one-third more to <b>total</b> <b>community</b> primary <b>production</b> than did those of the sea stack (169. 7 versus 116. 5 net mg C m- 2 h- 1), due mainly to the greater cover and concomitant production by Cyanophyta and fucalean Phaeophyta...|$|R

Light and dark incubation experiments {{were conducted in}} situ throughout the euphotic zone (0 - 175 m) on nine expeditions to Station ALOHA over a three-year period. Photosynthetrons were also used to elucidate rate responses in leucine and inorganic carbon assimilation {{as a function of}} light intensity. Taxonomic group and cell-specific rates were assessed using flow cytometric sorting. The light:dark assimilation rate ratios of leucine in the top 150 m were ~ 7 : 1 for Prochlorococcus, whereas the light:dark ratio for the non-pigmented bacteria was not significant different from 1 : 1. Prochlorococcus assimilated leucine in the dark at per cell rates similar to the non-pigmented bacteria, with a contribution to the <b>total</b> <b>community</b> bacterial <b>production,</b> integrated over the euphotic zone, of approximately 20 % in the dark and 60 % in the light. Depth-resolved primary productivity and leucine incorporation showed that the ratio of Prochlorococcus leucine:primary production peaked at 100 m then declined steeply below the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM). The photosynthetron experiments revealed that, for Prochlorococcus at the DCM, the saturating irradiance (Ek) for leucine incorporation was reached at approximately half the light intensity required for light saturation of 14 C-bicarbonate assimilation. Additionally, high and low red fluorescing Prochlorococcus populations (HRF and LRF), co-occurring at the DCM, had similar Ek values for their respective substrates, however, maximum assimilation rates, for both leucine and inorganic carbon, were two times greater for HRF cells. Our results show that Prochlorococcus contributes significantly to bacterial production estimates using 3 H-leucine, whether or not the incubations are conducted in the dark or light, and this should be considered when making assessments of bacterial production in marine environments where Prochlorococcus is present. Furthermore, Prochlorococcus primary productivity showed rate to light-flux patterns that were different from its light enhanced leucine incorporation. This decoupling from autotrophic growth may indicate a separate light stimulated mechanism for leucine acquisition...|$|R

Model outputs–such as net system production, size structure of the <b>community,</b> <b>total</b> throughput, <b>production,</b> consumption, production-to-respiration ratio, and Finn’s cycling index and mean path length–indicate that the systems around the unpopulated French Frigate Shoals and along the relatively lightly populated Kona Coast of Hawai’i Island are mature, stable systems with a high efficiency in recycling of biomass. In contrast, model results show that the reef system around the most populated island in the State of Hawai’i, O’ahu, is in a transitional state with reduced ecosystem resilience and appears to be shifting to an algaldominated system. Evaluation of the candidate indicators for fishing pressure showed that indicators at the community level (e. g., <b>total</b> biomass, <b>community</b> size structure, trophic level of the community) were most robust (i. e., showed the clearest trend) and that multiple indicators are necessary to identify fishing perturbations.

Analysis of the diel cycles of ‘‘real-time’’ net <b>community</b> <b>production</b> (NCPh), determined from the first-derivative of either cp or bbp, revealed ca. fourfold to eightfold lower daytime NCPh, twofold to fivefold lower daily maximum NCPh, and twice as much intraseasonal variability relative to the mean amplitude of diel variations for bbp. Although the timing of maximum of cp-derived NCPh was consistently prior to solar noon, significant seasonal differences in the timing of maximum bbp-derived NCPh was observed. Particulate backscattering {{may be used to}} infer biogeochemical properties, while greater understanding of the diel cycles of bbp is needed before bbp can be used to investigate daily community productio...|$|R
