5|$|The programmers {{suggested}} using 3D Studio Max for art {{and level}} design, which would {{save money by}} allowing the company to license {{a single piece of}} software, but the lead artists successfully lobbied against this plan, believing that allowing the respective teams to choose the software would allow them to work most efficiently. Huebner said this saved the project more time than any other decision made during development. The level designers chose QERadiant to take advantage of their previous experience using the software while working on Id Software's Quake series. Id allowed Nihilistic to license QERadiant and modify it to create a customized tool for its 3D environments. Because QERadiant was a finished, functional tool, it allowed the level designers to begin developing levels from the project's start and then export them into the NOD engine, rather than waiting for up to six months for Nihilistic to develop a custom tool or learning a new 3D level editor. In twenty-four months, the <b>three</b> <b>level</b> designers built over 100 in-game environments for Redemption. They obtained blueprints and sketches of buildings from medieval Prague and Vienna to better represent that period and locations. The four-person art team led by Kraaijvanger used Alias Wavefront Maya to create 3D art. Nihilistic's management wanted Kraaijvanger to use a less expensive tool but relented when the cost was found to be lower than had been thought. Throughout the project, the art team built over 1,500 3D models.|$|E

In Europe {{the use of}} three levels of air feeding with primary and secondary below the liquor guns started about 1980. At the same time stationary firing gained ground. Use of about 50% secondary seemed to give hot and stable lower furnace. Higher black liquor solids 65 – 70% started to be in use. Hotter lower furnace and improved reduction were reported. With <b>three</b> <b>level</b> air and higher dry solids the sulfur emissions could be kept in place.|$|E
40|$|Various {{aspects of}} {{operator}} performance during cranking {{are affected by}} the variability in crank size, resistance, location and position. Adequate prediction models incorporating these factors are not available to the designers of man-machine systems. Consequently a set of experiments was conducted using <b>three</b> <b>levels</b> of crank radius, <b>three</b> <b>levels</b> of torque, <b>three</b> <b>levels</b> of plane angle, <b>three</b> <b>levels</b> of crank height, and two turning directions (namely, clockwise and anti-clockwise) for continuous as well as intermittent cranking. The effect of radius, torque, plane angle and crank height were found to be significant and a subject's anthropometric dimensions and hand-arm strength influenced cranking performance significantly. Prediction models for the turning rate for continuous and intermittent cranking were developed...|$|R
50|$|This {{version was}} ported to the Game Boy by Factor 5, {{but due to}} space constraints, only <b>three</b> <b>levels</b> are present in this version and {{certain parts of the}} <b>three</b> <b>levels</b> are absent.

25|$|In Roman Catholic {{tradition}} a {{wide range}} of practices have developed, from devotions to the Holy Trinity to specific saints ranging from Saint Joseph to Saint Francis Xavier. The <b>three</b> <b>level</b> hierarchy of latria, hyperdulia and dulia determines the appropriate type of worship and veneration for different situations. The term latria (from the Greek , latreia) is used for worship, adoration and reverence directed only to the Holy Trinity. Dulia (from the Greek , douleia) is the kind of honor given to the communion of saints, {{with the exception of the}} Blessed Virgin Mary, who is honored with hyperdulia. Thus hyperdulia is below latria and above dulia.|$|E
