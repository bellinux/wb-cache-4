5|$|After these disappointments, Pioneer Pictures {{released}} a short film in three-strip <b>technicolor</b> called La Cucaracha which was well received. The film won an Academy Award in 1934. Pioneer released the first full-length <b>technicolor</b> film, Becky Sharp in 1935. Cooper helped to advocate and {{pave the way}} for the ground-breaking technology of <b>technicolor,</b> as well as the widescreen process called Cinerama.|$|E
5|$|Columbia {{distributed}} Disney's shorts for {{two years}} before the Disney studio entered a new distribution deal with United Artists in 1932. The same year, Disney signed a two-year exclusive deal with <b>Technicolor</b> to utilize its new 3-strip color film process, which allowed for fuller-color reproduction where previous color film processors could not. The result was the Silly Symphony Flowers and Trees, the first film commercially released in full <b>Technicolor.</b> Flowers and Trees was a major success, and all Silly Symphonies were subsequently produced in <b>Technicolor.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the <b>Technicolor</b> Corporation {{contracted}} with SRI {{to develop a}} near-instantaneous, electro-optical alternative to the manual process of timing during film copying. In 1959, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented the Scientific and Engineering Award jointly to SRI and <b>Technicolor</b> for their work on the design {{and development of the}} <b>Technicolor</b> electronic printing timer which greatly benefited the motion picture industry. In 1954, Southern Pacific asked SRI to investigate ways of reducing damage during rail freight shipments by mitigating shock to railroad box cars. This investigation led to William K. MacCurdy's development of the Hydra-Cushion technology, which remains standard today.|$|E

5000|$|A 1949 New York Times {{review of}} the film called it a [...] "great big {{beautiful}} musical, full of slickness and <b>Technicolored</b> plush, models and Xavier Cugat rhythm." ...|$|R
50|$|Mitchell {{supplied}} camera intermittent movements for <b>Technicolor's</b> Three-Strip camera (1932), {{and such}} movements for others' 65mm and VistaVision conversions before later making complete 65mm and VistaVision cameras (normal and high speed).|$|R
5|$|In 1973, Idriss Hassan Dirie {{directed}} Dan Iyo Xarrago ("Reality & Myth"). An early full-length film, it was {{processed in}} the <b>Technicolor</b> studios in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Following The Man {{with the}} Golden Gun, {{producer}} Harry Saltzman sold his 50% stake in Eon Productions' parent company, Danjaq, to United Artists to alleviate his financial problems, {{brought about by}} financial constraints following a downturn in the fortunes of <b>Technicolor,</b> {{in which he had}} invested heavily. The resulting legalities over the Bond property delayed production of the next Bond film, The Spy Who Loved Me.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} season, the visual effects {{supervisors}} were Dan Glass and Ryan Urban, {{the latter of}} whom held the title of digital effects supervisor during the first season. <b>Technicolor</b> were again responsible for managing dailies and color grading the show, while their VFX department delivered over 600 shots this time around.|$|E
5000|$|Edge {{enhancement}} {{is now a}} part of many electronically based color systems, but in [...] "Three-Strip" [...] <b>Technicolor's</b> day, it {{was accomplished}} photographically from the G image, the sharpest of the three.|$|R
50|$|Consequently, the {{introduction}} of color did not {{increase the number of}} moviegoers {{to the point where it}} was economical. This, and the Great Depression severely strained movie studios' finances, and spelled the end of <b>Technicolor's</b> first financial success.|$|R
50|$|The cartoon has, {{in recent}} years, taken on {{something}} of a cult following, with a pervasive impact on popular culture. The short, {{one of the earliest}} Merrie Melodies produced in <b>Technicolor's</b> 3-strip process, is recognized as one of Avery's early masterpieces.|$|R
5|$|Loving You is a 1957 American <b>Technicolor</b> musical drama {{structured}} as Elvis Presley's first starring film vehicle, {{following his}} debut {{the previous year}} in a supporting role in the black-and-white film, Love Me Tender. Directed by Hal Kanter, the cast is completed by Lizabeth Scott, Wendell Corey, and Dolores Hart in her movie debut.|$|E
5|$|MGM {{made two}} more Ziegfeld films â€“ one {{entitled}} Ziegfeld Girl (1941), starring James Stewart, Judy Garland, Hedy Lamarr, and Lana Turner, which recycled some footage from The Great Ziegfeld, and in 1946, Ziegfeld Follies by Vincente Minnelli. In 1951, they produced their <b>Technicolor</b> remake of Show Boat, which Ziegfeld had {{presented as a}} stage musical.|$|E
5|$|RKO {{released}} a limited slate of twelve features {{in its first}} year; in 1930, that figure more than doubled to twenty-nine. Originally organized as the distinct business entities RKO Productions Inc. and RKO Distributing Corp., by July the studio was making a transition to the new, unified RKO Radio Pictures Inc. Encouraged by Rio Ritas success, RKO produced several costly musicals incorporating <b>Technicolor</b> sequences, among them Dixiana and Hit the Deck, both scripted and directed, like Rio Rita, by Luther Reed. Following {{the example of the}} other major studios, RKO had planned to create its own musical revue, Radio Revels. Promoted as the studio's most extravagant production to date, it was to be photographed entirely in <b>Technicolor.</b> The project was abandoned, however, as the public's taste for musicals temporarily subsided. From a total of more than sixty Hollywood musicals in 1929 and over eighty the following year, the number dropped to eleven in 1931. RKO was left in a bind: it still had a contract with <b>Technicolor</b> to produce two more features with its system. Complicating matters, audiences had come to associate color with the momentarily out-of-favor musical genre due to a glut of such productions from the major Hollywood studios. Fulfilling its obligations, RKO produced two all-Technicolor pictures, The Runaround and Fanny Foley Herself (both 1931), containing no musical sequences. Neither was a success.|$|E
5000|$|The {{show is a}} pseudo-reality cooking show filmed on an elaborate, <b>technicolored</b> {{cardboard}} kitchen set. Each episode features multi-course, out-of-this-world gourmet meals {{cooked up}} by hostess Thu Tran and a cast of colorful puppets for arriving [...] "celebrity" [...] guests.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{popular at}} the box office, {{it was not a}} {{critical}} success. Bosley Crowther of the New York Times voiced a common opinion, finding the film's plot [...] "banal" [...] and observing, [...] "It's really Mario Lanza's singing that should and will attract attention to this <b>technicolored</b> film." ...|$|R
50|$|Picheta {{produced}} Bon Jovi: Live from London, {{which took}} place at Wembley Stadium, though he has also directed Bon Jovi videos. He then filmed theatre productions, notably those of Andrew Lloyd Webber's, including Joseph and the Amazing <b>Technicolored</b> Dreamcoat, and Cats. He also produced the 1999 musical version of Oklahoma!, starring Hugh Jackman and directed by Trevor Nunn. In 1998 and 1999 Picheta directed and produced three musicals, (Cats, Joseph and the Amazing <b>Technicolored</b> Dreamcoat and Oklahoma!), {{as well as the}} Andrew Lloyd Webber: The Royal Albert Hall Celebration. Picheta produced The Merchant Of Venice in 2001 and then producing the film version of Kiss Me, Kate, which had previously run for 1,077 stage performances on Broadway. In 2004, he was nominated for an Emmy Award, for his directing of Elaine Stritch at Liberty, a biographical film of the stage star Elaine Stritch, documenting her career and personal life.|$|R
5|$|Recently, the amphitheater has {{incorporated}} new musicals {{into its}} performance schedule, {{in addition to}} The Stephen Foster Story. In 2008, the amphitheater produced The Civil War in celebration of the Lincoln Bicentennial. In 2009, a second musical, Joseph and the Amazing <b>Technicolor</b> Dreamcoat, was staged. Other musicals have included The Wizard of Oz, and All Shook Up. In addition, the amphitheater hosts a summer concert series.|$|E
5|$|Sculptor Haig Patigian, {{painters}} Hovsep Pushman and, most notably, Arshile Gorky are {{the most}} famous American artists of Armenian origin. Rouben Mamoulian, a film and theater director also known as co-producer of the first feature film (Becky Sharp, 1935) to use the three-strip <b>Technicolor</b> process. Ross Bagdasarian, Sr., William Saroyan's cousin, created Alvin and the Chipmunks.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} of Snow White, work had continued on the Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies series of shorts. Mickey Mouse switched to <b>Technicolor</b> in 1935, by which time the series had added several major supporting characters, among them Mickey's dog Pluto and their friends Donald Duck and Goofy. Donald, Goofy, and Pluto would all be appearing in series of their own by 1940, and the Donald Duck cartoons eclipsed the Mickey Mouse series in popularity. The Silly Symphonies, which garnered seven , ended in 1939.|$|E
500|$|A plot twist then occurs {{towards the}} clip's {{ending with the}} use of fire and <b>technicolored</b> imagery, where Del Rey gently brushes her hair off her {{shoulders}} in the middle of superimposed flames. The singer sports a red dress in the Sunset Boulevard-styled scene and sings [...] "I'm in love" [...] continuously while up in flames, until the music video fades out.|$|R
50|$|Bleach bypass {{generally}} {{refers to}} a complete circumvention of the bleach stage of development, and is the most commonly offered service among labs. <b>Technicolor's</b> ENR and OZ and Deluxe Labs' ACE and CCE processes are proprietary variants which allow the film to be only partially bleached, giving the cinematographer a more finely tuned control over the effect rendered by the process.|$|R

5|$|Filmed in <b>Technicolor</b> and Panavision, The Wild Bunch {{is noted}} for intricate, multi-angle, quick-cut editing, using normal and slow motion images, a revolutionary cinema {{technique}} in 1969. The writing of Green, Peckinpah, and Roy N. Sickner {{was nominated for}} a best-screenplay Academy Award, and the music by Jerry Fielding was nominated for Best Original Score. Additionally, Peckinpah {{was nominated for a}}n Outstanding Directorial Achievement award by the Directors Guild of America and cinematographer Lucien Ballard won the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Cinematography.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Turner {{appeared}} {{in her first}} <b>Technicolor</b> film, as Lady de Winter in The Three Musketeers, opposite Gene Kelly, Van Heflin, and June Allyson. In November 1947, she agreed to do the film, thereby giving up an unfinished film project called Bedeviled. However, in January 1948, {{it was reported that}} she had withdrawn from the film. Initially, Louis B. Mayer gave her permission for doing so because of her schedule, but she was later that month put on suspension. Eventually, Turner agreed to make the film, but did not start production until March due to having to lose weight.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Muntz {{decided to}} sell blank tapes and VCRs as loss leaders to attract {{customers}} to his showroom, where he would then try to sell them his projection TV systems. His success continued through the early 1980s until he invested heavily in the <b>Technicolor</b> Compact Video Cassette (CVC), a 1/4in(0.6cm) system designed to compete with Betamax, VHS, and the Super 8 film home-movie system. The CVC format failed in the marketplace, sales quickly eroded, and Muntz's store closed soon after.|$|E
25|$|The real {{push for}} color films and the nearly {{immediate}} changeover from black-and-white production to nearly all color film were pushed {{forward by the}} prevalence of television in the early 1950s. In 1947, only 12 percent of American films were made in color. By 1954, that number rose to over 50 percent. The rise in color films was also aided by the breakup of <b>Technicolor's</b> near monopoly on the medium.|$|R
500|$|Khondji {{employed}} large tungsten lighting units, including 18K HMIs, dino and Wendy lights. He used Arriflex's VariCon, which {{functions as}} an illuminated filter, and incorporated much more lens filtration {{than he had}} on previous projects. <b>Technicolor's</b> ENR silver retention, when combined with the VariCon, was used to control the contrast and black density of the film's release prints. The finished film features 299 scenes and 3,000 shots from [...] of film.|$|R
50|$|During production, an {{alternative}} black-and-white version {{was shot and}} still exists, although side-by-side comparison shows that most takes between the two are the same. Differences in takes are minor, such as Tracy's ad lib with a skeleton in the closet, and Mae Busch's dialogue as a madam at a brothel. The black-and-white version was offered to exhibitors (much to <b>Technicolor's</b> dismay) as {{an alternative}} on the initial release of the film.|$|R
5|$|Principal {{photography}} for {{the film}} took place mostly in Ooty and in a bungalow near Pollachi. One song sequence was filmed in Marina Beach, Chennai. It was the first full-length comedy film by Sridhar, who was then known for making dramatic films. It {{was also the first}} Tamil film to be released in Eastmancolor; previous Indian colour films were made in Gevacolor and <b>Technicolor.</b> The cinematographers were A. Vincent and P. N. Sundaram, and the editor was N. M. Shankar. The film's soundtrack and score were composed by the duo Viswanathanâ€“Ramamoorthy, with lyrics written by poet Kannadasan.|$|E
5|$|Produced and {{distributed}} by Panthulu under his banner, Padmini Pictures, Veerapandiya Kattabomman is {{loosely based on}} the story of the 18th century South Indian chieftain of the same name, who rose in rebellion against the East India Company. The film was an adaptation of the play Kattabomman, performed by Sivaji Ganesan's troupe. Most of the film was shot in Jaipur. Veerapandiya Kattabomman is notable for being the first Tamil film to be released in <b>Technicolor.</b>|$|E
5|$|Renoir used few close-ups {{or reverse}} shots {{and most of}} the shots are two shots. The hunt scene differs {{from the rest of the}} film; it uses rapid editing whereas most of the film uses long takes of {{dialogue}} or action. Renoir wanted to shoot the film in color to take advantage of the beauty of Sologne in the winter but he was unable to secure funding from Jean Jay. One week before filming began Renoir tried to persuade <b>Technicolor</b> to fund the color cinematography but the company refused.|$|E
50|$|The Godfather Part II {{was shot}} between October 1, 1973 and June 19, 1974, {{and was the}} last major American motion picture to have release prints made with <b>Technicolor's</b> dye {{imbibition}} process until the late 1990s. The scenes {{that took place in}} Cuba were shot in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Charles Bluhdorn, whose Gulf+Western conglomerate owned Paramount, felt strongly about developing the Dominican Republic as a movie-making site.|$|R
50|$|Money From Home is {{also the}} only Martin and Lewis film made in 3-D, having been shot with <b>Technicolor's</b> 3-D camera rig, which exposed six strips of film in synchronization. It was the second and final time the rig was used. The film was also the third and last time one of the team's {{features}} was available with a Western Electric, 3-track stereophonic soundtrack. This soundtrack is now lost.|$|R
