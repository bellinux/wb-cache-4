5|$|At present, some 192 spells are known, {{though no}} single {{manuscript}} contains them all. They served {{a range of}} purposes. Some are intended to give <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> mystical knowledge in the afterlife, or perhaps to identify them with the gods: for instance, Spell 17 is an obscure and lengthy description of the god Atum. Others are incantations to ensure the different elements of the dead person's being were preserved and reunited, and to give <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> control over the world around him. Still others protect <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> from various hostile forces or guide him through the underworld past various obstacles. Famously, two spells also deal with the judgement of <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> in the Weighing of the Heart ritual.|$|E

5|$|Wealthy Egyptians {{were buried}} with larger {{quantities}} of luxury items, but all burials, regardless of social status, included goods for <b>the</b> <b>deceased.</b> Beginning in the New Kingdom, {{books of the}} dead {{were included in the}} grave, along with shabti statues that were believed to perform manual labor for them in the afterlife. Rituals in which <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> was magically re-animated accompanied burials. After burial, living relatives were expected to occasionally bring food to the tomb and recite prayers on behalf of <b>the</b> <b>deceased.</b>|$|E

This collection of peotry is spawned {{from the pool}} of nothingness. That is, it is from all that is uncounted, downtrodden. <b>The</b> recently <b>deceased</b> are not dead, recently or otherwise.

5|$|The Eye's {{importance}} {{extends to}} the afterlife as well. Egyptian funerary texts associate deceased souls with Ra in his nightly travels through the Duat, {{the realm of the}} dead, and with his rebirth at dawn. In these texts the Eye and its various manifestations often appear, protecting and giving birth to <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> as they do for Ra. A spell in the Coffin Texts states that Bastet, as the Eye, illuminates the Duat like a torch, allowing <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> to pass safely through its depths.|$|E

50|$|Estate duty {{is similar}} to {{donations}} tax {{in that it is}} a tax on the transfer of wealth.

It is 20% on the amount remaining in <b>the</b> <b>deceased's</b> estate over R3.5 million.|$|R
50|$|The Catawba {{people used}} an entirely {{different}} system of divination, which is still classified as lecanomany, whereby a bowl of water was placed by a deceased person's head.

5|$|Torajans perform dances {{on several}} occasions, most often during their {{elaborate}} funeral ceremonies. They dance {{to express their}} grief, and to honour and even cheer <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> person because {{he is going to}} have a long journey in the afterlife. First, a group of men form a circle and sing a monotonous chant throughout the night to honour <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> (a ritual called Ma'badong). This is considered by many Torajans to be the most important component of the funeral ceremony. On the second funeral day, the Ma'randing warrior dance is performed to praise the courage of <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> during life. Several men perform the dance with a sword, a large shield made from buffalo skin, a helmet with a buffalo horn, and other ornamentation. The Ma'randing dance precedes a procession in which <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> is carried from a rice barn to the rante, the site of the funeral ceremony. During the funeral, elder women perform the Ma'katia dance while singing a poetic song and wearing a long feathered costume. The Ma'akatia dance is performed to remind the audience of the generosity and loyalty of <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> person. After the bloody ceremony of buffalo and pig slaughter, a group of boys and girls clap their hands while performing a cheerful dance called Ma'dondan.|$|E
5|$|When {{a person}} dies in a house, the death must be {{notified}} {{to the authorities}} within 24 hours by the occupier {{of the house in}} which to his or her knowledge the death took place, the relatives of <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> present at his or her death or in attendance during the last illness of <b>the</b> <b>deceased,</b> or each person present at the death. If those persons fail to do so, another inmate of the house or the person causing the body of <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> person to be buried.|$|E
5|$|A large {{quantity}} of funerary urns have been excavated from {{the bases of}} buildings; <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> were cremated and their ashes collected in the urns. The sides of the urns were perforated with three holes, perhaps to represent the eyes and mouth of <b>the</b> <b>deceased.</b> The urns were decorated with polychrome motifs {{in the form of}} highly stylised serpent decorations painted in black, red and cream; this style of Maya ceramics has been labelled as Chinautla Polychrome after the site where it was first identified. The Postclassic Maya custom of interring the cremated remains of <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> in urns was restricted to the elite; commoners where buried in simple tombs outside the city centre. In Jilotepeque Viejo urns were usually buried under the front of platform bases or under the sides of pyramids and altars. This was not a general practice among the highland Maya in the Postclassic and represents a tradition unique to the city. Funerary urns have been found interred under all the principal plazas of the city. Approximately equal proportions of urns were interred under platforms and under the ceremonial architecture represented by pyramids and altars, although it is impossible to say if those individuals buried under religious architecture had differing roles than those buried under secular architecture.|$|E

[...] The will left her assets to her children who lived in other US states. Instead, Barnes worked with Koretta Ann King (<b>the</b> <b>deceased’s</b> in-home nurse), Andrea Lee Barksdale and Alex Habersham to embezzle the estate. Barnes transferred the house and property (worth $200,000) to his ex-wife. [...] King and Barksdale fraudulently closed <b>the</b> <b>deceased's</b> annuity receiving a cheque for $93,600, which Barnes deposited in the estate's bank account, and then shared with the group.

50|$|Collaterals can be first-, second- or third-line.

Second-line collaterals are {{the issue of the}} grandparents not including the parents, which includes uncles and aunts, and first cousins.

50|$|Kont {{is a kind}} of Saint Lucian folk song, {{performed}} as part of the funereal ceremony by mourners outside <b>the</b> <b>deceaseds</b> house. These mourners sing kont, a responsorial Creole song, accompanied by drumming. The lyrics may refer to the last words or other aspects of <b>the</b> <b>deceaseds</b> death. Mourners also dance to both the débòt and bélé, accompanied zo or tibwa and ka.|$|R
5000|$|The Fore {{believe that}} the land they live in, or bagina, is alive, and that it created the world. The bagina also created the {{ancestor}} guardians, amani, from which the Fore are descended. The Fore {{believe that the}}re are five souls: the auma, the ama, the aona, the yesegi, and the kwela. [...] When a person dies, the Fore conduct mortuary rituals to ensure that each soul reaches its proper destination. Upon death, the auma, or good aspects of a person, travels to kwelanandamundi, the land of the dead. To help the auma reach kwelanandamundi, <b>the</b> <b>deceased’s</b> family members leave food with the body. Two to three days after death, the body may be buried, entombed, or cooked and consumed. If consumed, <b>the</b> <b>deceased’s</b> ama blesses those who eat. The aona, or special abilities of a person, passes on to <b>the</b> <b>deceased’s</b> preferred child, while the yesegi, or ancestral power of a person, is passed on to all <b>the</b> <b>deceased’s</b> children. Purification rituals during and after consumption of the body ensure that the kwela, or the pollution of a dead body, does not taint those who eat it. Through such rituals, the Fore assure that <b>the</b> <b>deceased’s</b> positive aspects remain in the tribe, while the auma, ama, and kwela reach kwelanandamundi.|$|R
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} funerary stelas for {{officials}} of the late Third dynasty, small amounts of biographical detail were added next to <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> men's titles. However, {{it was not until}} the Sixth dynasty that narratives of the lives and careers of government officials were inscribed. Tomb biographies became more detailed during the Middle Kingdom, and included information about <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> person's family. The vast majority of autobiographical texts are dedicated to scribal bureaucrats, but during the New Kingdom some were dedicated to military officers and soldiers. Autobiographical texts of the Late Period place a greater stress upon seeking help from deities than acting righteously to succeed in life. Whereas earlier autobiographical texts exclusively dealt with celebrating successful lives, Late Period autobiographical texts include laments for premature death, similar to the epitaphs of ancient Greece.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{domestic}} decoration, Han artwork {{also served}} an important funerary function. Han artists and craftsmen decorated the wall bricks lining underground tombs of <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> with mural paintings and carved reliefs; {{the purpose of}} this artwork was to aid <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> in traveling through their afterlife journey. Stamping artistic designs into tile and brick was also common. Human figurine sculptures found in Han tombs were placed there to perform various functions for <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> in the afterlife, such as dancing and playing music for entertainment, as well as serving food. A common type of ceramic figurine found in Han tombs is a female entertainer sporting long, flowing silk sleeves that are flung about while dancing. Some ceramic human figures—both male and female—have been found naked, all with clearly distinguished genitalia and missing arms. This is because they once had wooden or cloth arms which were attached to holes in the shoulders by pegs, as well as miniature clothes made of perishable materials such as silk.|$|E
5|$|Burial PNT-002 was interred with Burial PNT-003 in {{the third}} stepped {{platform}} of the second version of the Lost World Pyramid (5C-54) prior to the fourth platform being completed. <b>The</b> <b>deceased</b> was an adult male aged between 36 and 55 years old; he was found lying extended on his back with a southeast-northwest orientation. Most of the bones were preserved to a certain degree; although the skull was badly fragmented {{it was evident that}} artificial craneal deformation had taken place. One of the upper canine teeth was fitted with pyrite decoration; the other canine had a crescent-shaped hollow that had once held its decoration. <b>The</b> <b>deceased</b> had several items of shell jewellery.|$|E
