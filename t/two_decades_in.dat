5|$|After the {{collapse}} of Imperial Germany in November 1918, the Finns sought new political partners. The United Kingdom had been a significant trading partner since the 18th century, and the Finns worked to improve the relations for the next <b>two</b> <b>decades.</b> <b>In</b> the 1930s Finland purchased Thornycroft torpedo boats from the United Kingdom, and also refrained from buying bomber aircraft from Germany because of British protests, purchasing instead modern Bristol Blenheims, which later served successfully during the Winter War.|$|E
5|$|Caio Duilios {{career was}} uneventful.

Further defences were added to the walls until work stopped around 1290. Local disputes remained. De Clare argued with Humphrey de Bohun, the earl of Hereford, in 1290 and the following year the case was brought before the king, resulting in the temporary royal seizure of Caerphilly.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Pillau was ceded to Italy as a war {{prize in}} 1920. Renamed Bari, she was {{commissioned}} in the Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in January 1924. She was modified and rebuilt several times over the next <b>two</b> <b>decades.</b> <b>In</b> the early years of World War II, she provided gunfire support to Italian troops in several engagements in the Mediterranean. In 1943, she was slated to become an anti-aircraft defense ship, but while awaiting conversion, she was sunk by USAAF bombers in Livorno in June 1943. The wreck was partially scrapped by the Germans in 1944, and ultimately raised for scrapping in January 1948.|$|E

Lepanto was converted into a training ship in 1902 and Italia was significantly modernized in 190508 before also becoming a training ship. They briefly saw action during the Italo-Turkish War, where they provided gunfire support to Italian troops defending Tripoli. Lepanto was discarded in early 1915, though Italia continued on as a guard ship during World War I, eventually being converted into a grain transport.

5|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, women's {{football}} was a niche sport in Germany and was frowned upon. When the DFB appointed Gero Bisanz to coach the newly founded women's national team, he was initially very reluctant about his assignment and feared it would harm his reputation. Winning the 1989 European Championship was the team's first international success, but it had little lasting effect on their popularity. As a gift for the first European trophy, every player received a tea set, which is often cited {{as an example of}} male chauvinism and general lack of interest in the women's national team at that time. This attitude within the German Football Association has changed considerably in the last <b>two</b> <b>decades,</b> <b>in</b> particular during the term of Theo Zwanziger as DFB president, an outspoken supporter of women's football.|$|E
5|$|In 1902 Bondfield met Mary Macarthur, some {{eight years}} her junior, {{who chaired the}} Ayr branch of NAUSAWC. Macarthur, the {{daughter}} of a wealthy Scottish draper, had held staunchly Conservative views until a works meeting in 1901 to discuss the formation of a NAUSAWC branch transformed her into an ardent trades unionist. In 1903 Macarthur moved to London where, with Bondfield's recommendation, she became secretary of the Women's Trade Union League. The two became close comrades-in-arms during the next <b>two</b> <b>decades,</b> <b>in</b> a range of causes affecting women. The historian Lise Sanders suggests that Bondfield's more intimate friendships tended to be with women rather than men; Bondfield's biographer Mary Hamilton described Macarthur as the romance of Bondfield's life.|$|E
5|$|The Israel {{national}} football team has represented Israel in international association football since 1934, when it played its first official game (as Mandatory Palestine or Eretz Israel—"Land of Israel") against Egypt.

5|$|The Port of Calais was {{the first}} cable ship port in Europe and is the fourth largest port in France and the largest for {{passenger}} traffic. The port {{accounts for more than}} a third of economic activity of the town of Calais. Cargo traffic has tripled over the past <b>two</b> <b>decades.</b> <b>In</b> 2007 more than 41.5 million tonnes of traffic passed through Calais with some 11.52 million passengers, 1.4 million trucks and trailers, 2.249 million cars and 4,700 crossings a year. On average, ships sail from the port every 30 minutes. A new 400 million euro project is underway at the port to create a breakwater protecting a pool of 700 meters long, thus allowing virtually all types of ships to stop at Calais.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his career}} as a {{professional}} footballer and for years afterwards, Ramsey claimed to be two years younger than he really was — including in his ghosted autobiography, Talking Football, published in 1952. This began when Ramsey first turned professional with Southampton during the Second World War. He told Southampton he was born in 1922 rather than 1920, reasoning that this might improve his career prospects and compensate for the years he had lost to the hostilities. He propagated this false age for over <b>two</b> <b>decades,</b> <b>in</b> press articles, his autobiography and Who's Who — but not on official documents such as his marriage papers, in which he listed his true date of birth. Only after his knighthood in 1967 did Ramsey reveal his true age, deciding that he could not lie to Debrett's, publisher of Debrett's Peerage & Baronetage.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{possible}} {{defeat of the}} Jurchens threatened {{the power of the}} new emperor of the Southern Song, Gaozong and his premier Qin Hui. The reason for this was that Qinzong, the last emperor of the Northern Song was living in Jin-imposed exile in Manchuria and had a good chance of being recalled to the throne should the Jin dynasty be destroyed. Although Yue Fei had penetrated into enemy territory as far as Luoyang, he was ordered to head back to the capital and halt his campaign. Emperor Gaozong signed the Treaty of Shaoxing in 1141 that fixed the borders at the Huai River, as well as conceded territory regained through the efforts of Yue Fei, while Yue was killed during imprisonment. As part of the treaty, the Song were also forced to pay tribute to the Jin, much as it had to the Liao. With the treaty of Shaoxing, hostilities ceased between the Jin and Song dynasties for the next <b>two</b> <b>decades.</b> <b>In</b> the meantime, Emperor Gaozong negotiated with the Jin over his mother's ransom while he commissioned a symbolic art project about her, the Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute, originally based upon the life of Cai Wenji (b. 177). Gaozong's mother was eventually released and brought south, but Qinzong was never freed from his confinement in the north.|$|E

5|$|In about 880, after <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> <b>in</b> Córdoba, Onneca {{abandoned}} her Muslim family, {{and returned with}} her father to Pamplona, to which he would shortly succeed. Shortly after her return, Onneca married her first cousin Aznar Sánchez de Laron. Together they had a son and two daughters, probably born between 880 and 890: Sancho, Toda and Sancha. Their son Sancho Aznar is only known from the Roda Codex genealogies and may have died young. Their daughters Toda and Sancha would both become queens consort of Pamplona by marrying into the Jiménez dynasty, which {{came to power in}} 905 after displacing Onneca's father Fortún Garcés from the throne. Toda married Sancho I Garcés, thus uniting the royal houses of Íñiguez and Jiménez. Toda's sister Sancha was wedded to Sancho I Garcés' brother and successor Jimeno Garcés, and was later killed in France by her son García Jiménez.|$|E
5|$|Onneca's father Fortún Garcés, {{the then}} {{heir to the}} throne of Pamplona, was {{captured}} in 860 in the town of Milagro during a punitive expedition led by Muhammad I, the Muslim emir of Córdoba, against the small Kingdom of Pamplona. The expedition resulted in the devastation of the Christian kingdom's territory and the seizure of three castles by the Muslim forces. Fortun Garcés, nicknamed al-Anqar (الأنقر) by the Muslims because he was one-eyed, was taken to Córdoba where he was detained for <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> <b>in</b> gilded captivity. Onneca accompanied or followed her father to Córdoba, where she was wedded to Muhammad I's son Abdullah around 862/863. It is not known when or how she came to Córdoba. She may have been captured with her father, or sent to join her father at the emir's court at a later date. Onneca was presumably still a teenager when she bore Abdullah a son named Muhammad in 864. As Abdullah's wife, Onneca became known as Durr. According to some sources, she converted to Islam.|$|E
5|$|Pathan {{subsequently}} led {{the pace}} attack {{again on the}} 2004 Test tour to Pakistan, taking 12 wickets and bowling {{a higher proportion of}} maiden overs than any other bowler to help secure India's first series victory over Pakistan in <b>two</b> <b>decades.</b> <b>In</b> the first innings, he bowled 28 overs and took 4/100 to help India restrict their arch-rivals to 407 and take a 268-run lead. After stand-in captain Rahul Dravid enforced the follow on, Pathan tied the Pakistanis down, bowling 12 maidens in his 21 overs to end with 2/26 as India secured an innings win. Pathan then scored 49 in the Second Test in Lahore after a batting collapse of the top order, helping India to recover to 287. However this was not enough as Pakistan reached 489 despite Pathan bowling 44 overs to take 3/107, and the hosts went on to complete a nine-wicket win. In the deciding Test in Rawalpindi, Pathan took 2/49 and 1/35 in an innings win. He ended the series with 12 wickets at 28.50 and 64 runs at 21.33.|$|E
