25|$|As written above, Basel {{were certain}} to finish {{top of the}} section before matchday six. For the last match in the group stage Basel had {{to travel to the}} INEA Stadion in Poznań. Lech Poznań had already lost to Basel three <b>times</b> <b>this</b> <b>season</b> and only a win would have given them any chance of making it through Group I. Unable to play were {{defenders}} Manuel Akanji, Philipp Degen and Daniel Høegh (all due to injury), as well as Marek Suchý, who was out suspended. Walter Samuel made his 100th UEFA club competition appearance playing this match. Reserve goalkeeper Germano Vailati was again Basel's starter because of first choice goalkeeper Tomáš Vaclík's injury. In the 44th minute, Vailati himself also suffered an injury as he played a long pass forward. Just before half-time, third-choice goalkeeper Mirko Salvi was introduced and made his professional debut for the club. Adonis Ajeti also made his debut for the club after coming on as a substitute at half-time in place of Michael Lang. Jean-Paul Boëtius scored the only goal five minutes after half-time, it was his first goal for the Swiss champions.|$|E
25|$|That game in {{hand was}} played four days later, with United playing host to Bolton Wanderers on 19 March. Man Utd started {{the game at}} their usual fast pace, and it took just nine minutes for Cristiano Ronaldo, the team's captain for the day, to find {{the back of the}} net after Carlos Tevez's poorly hit bicycle kick was saved. That goal brought Ronaldo level with George Best's record of 32 goals from midfield in a season, but only ten minutes later, the record was broken. Fouled about 10yards outside the penalty area, Ronaldo set himself up for one of his {{trademark}} free kicks; one dipping shot later, the score was 2–0. The tone of the game changed from that point on, as United began to relax into a groove, but, as has happened so many <b>times</b> <b>this</b> <b>season,</b> despite the threat of a high-scoring game, no more goals were to come. Both teams posed threats to the other's goal, with Bolton managing to get the ball into the Manchester United net twice in the second half, only to have the goals ruled out for various reasons, while both Nani and Carlos Tevez wasted as many chances between them {{as the rest of the}} United team put together. Nevertheless, the win put United three points clear at the top of the table with eight games left to play.|$|E

500|$|Michael Liedtke and George Avalos of the Contra Costa Times {{were pleased}} with the episode and wrote, [...] "The latest episode also {{contained}} many {{of the elements of}} a classic mythology episode. The stakes were huge and the heroes faced the greatest of hazards. The use of the oil rig created a sense of isolation for Mulder and Doggett, and the paranoia levels were sky-high. We still can't figure out why we haven't seen more episodes along the lines of Vienen during the past three seasons." [...] Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity awarded the episode a [...] "B–". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave Vienen a positive review, and wrote, [...] "after watching 'Vienen', I can honestly say that for once of the few <b>times</b> <b>this</b> <b>season,</b> it felt good to be an X-Files fan again". Kessenich praised the significant development in Mulder and Scully's relationship and the return of the [...] "fourth season version" [...] of the black oil; the 1998 movie had dramatically altered the nature of the substanceinfected hosts gestate aliens inside their bodies rather than merely being taken over.|$|E
