5|$|California has {{experienced}} less possessory land claim litigation than other states. This is primarily {{the result of}} the Land Claims Act of 1851 (following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo) that required all claims deriving from the Spanish and Mexican governments <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>filed</b> within two years. Three U.S. Supreme Court decisions and one Ninth Circuit ruling have held that the Land Claims Act applied to aboriginal title, and thus extinguished all aboriginal title in the state (as no tribes filed claims under the Act). Two Deputy Attorneys General of California have advocated this view.|$|E
5|$|In 1646, {{the council}} allowed the Barber Surgeons {{to build their}} hall {{just east of the}} site: this {{agreement}} was given on 15 March 1647. In 1648, the plot of land was leased to the barber surgeons on condition that they constructed their hall within two years and that part of the site was to be laid out as a garden for medicinal herbs. A second hall built in 1730 disappeared under the railway viaduct in the 1840s. The most aged claimants were preferred for placements at the Hospital and on 22 March 1779, the Mayor and common council of Newcastle ordered that several candidates produce certificates to prove their respective ages, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>filed</b> in the town-clerk's office.|$|E

5|$|If a {{mandatory}} order, prohibiting order or quashing order is sought, the applicant must follow the procedure {{set out in}} Order 53 of the Rules of Court. In general, there are two stages. At the first stage, an applicant must obtain leave {{to apply for the}} prerogative order. This requirement prevents unmeritorious applications from being taken against decision-makers by filtering out groundless cases at an early stage to prevent wastage of judicial time, and protects public bodies from harassment, intentional or otherwise. An application for such leave must be made by ex parte originating summons and must be supported by a statement setting out the name and description of the applicant, the relief sought and the grounds on which it is sought; and by an affidavit, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>filed</b> when the application is made, verifying the facts relied on. In granting leave, the judge hearing the application for leave may impose such terms as to costs and as to security as he or she thinks fit.|$|E

In total, they requested and additional $122billion, which would bring the overall projected production cost to $188 billion. The uranium enriched power plants only requested a total of $4billion, which was later accepted by both the NRC and DOE. The provided loan guarantees encourage private lenders to fund these companies.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Federal {{legislation}} yields to state-regulated standard times in many diverse situations. For example, it yields {{in setting the}} normal working times of Federal employees, the recognition of public holidays, etc. The Federal government also relies on local times for Federal elections, so that the polls in Western Australia close {{two or three hours}} after those in the eastern states. Also, documents <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>filed</b> in a Federal Court may be filed based on the local time. The effect of this is that {{if there had been a}} failure to file a legal document on time in an eastern State, that document can sometimes still be filed (within two hours) in Western Australia.|$|E

On June 22, the county appealed the judgment and requested that the court lift the injunction on issuing an occupancy certificate. The request was turned down on July 2, meaning that the full court process – taking up to a year – would be required.|$|E
