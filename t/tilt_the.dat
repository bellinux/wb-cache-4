5|$|Along {{with the}} Sun, the {{gravitational}} influence of Jupiter has {{helped shape the}} Solar System. The orbits {{of most of the}} system's planets lie closer to Jupiter's orbital plane than the Sun's equatorial plane (Mercury is the only planet that is closer to the Sun's equator in orbital <b>tilt),</b> <b>the</b> Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt are mostly caused by Jupiter, and the planet may have been responsible for the Late Heavy Bombardment of the inner Solar System's history.|$|E
5|$|In 1850 and in 1862, Léon Foucault made {{improved}} determinations of {{the speed}} of light substituting a rotating mirror for Fizeau's toothed wheel. (Figure2) The apparatus involves light from slit S reflecting off a rotating mirror R, forming an image of the slit on the distant stationary mirror M, which is then reflected back to reform an image of the original slit. If mirror R is stationary, then the slit image will reform at S regardless of the mirror's <b>tilt.</b> <b>The</b> situation is different, however, if R is in rapid rotation.|$|E

25|$|Pitch {{control is}} {{achieved}} by <b>tilting</b> <b>the</b> rotor fore and aft; roll control by <b>tilting</b> <b>the</b> rotor laterally (side to side). Three designs to affect <b>the</b> <b>tilt</b> of <b>the</b> rotor are a tilting hub (Cierva), swashplate (Air & Space 18A), or servo-flaps. A rudder provides yaw control. On pusher configuration autogyros, the rudder is typically placed in the propeller slipstream to maximize yaw control at low airspeed (but not always, {{as seen in the}} McCulloch J-2, with twin rudders placed outboard of the propeller arc).|$|R

5|$|Like {{most other}} regular {{planetary}} moons, Callisto's rotation is locked to be synchronous with its orbit. The length of Callisto's day, simultaneously its orbital period, is about 16.7 Earth days. Its orbit is very slightly eccentric and inclined to the Jovian equator, with the eccentricity and inclination changing quasi-periodically due to solar and planetary gravitational perturbations on a timescale of centuries. The ranges of change are 0.00720.0076 and 0.200.60°, respectively. These orbital variations cause the axial <b>tilt</b> (<b>the</b> angle between rotational and orbital axes) to vary between 0.4 and 1.6°.|$|E
5|$|Tidal flexing kneads Europa's {{interior}} and ice shell, which becomes {{a source of}} heat.

Europa's seafloor could be heated by the moon's constant flexing, driving hydrothermal activity similar to undersea volcanoes in Earth's oceans.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{years after}} the events of Star Fox 64, Krystal looks for answers to the {{destruction}} of her home planet, Cerinia and the death of her parents. She lands on Krazoa Palace, after receiving a distress call from the planet and discovers that it was attacked by General Scales and the SharpClaw army. Krystal is persuaded by a wounded EarthWalker in the Palace to help by collecting all of the Krazoa Spirits and returning them to the palace, which would supposedly <b>tilt</b> <b>the</b> war in the dinosaurs' favour and stop Scales. However, after releasing the first one, a mysterious being sends Krystal into the spirit's path, trapping her in a floating crystal atop the Krazoa Palace until all the spirits can be returned.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{most popular}} <b>tilting</b> methods are <b>the</b> {{single-axis}} and <b>the</b> dual-axis <b>tilting</b> methods. <b>The</b> geometry of most specimen holders and electron microscopes normally precludes <b>tilting</b> <b>the</b> specimen through a full 180° range, {{which can lead}} to artifacts in the 3D reconstruction of the target. By using dual-axis <b>tilting,</b> <b>the</b> reconstruction artifacts are reduced by a factor of [...] compared to single-axis tilting. However, twice as many images need to be taken.

40|$|We {{investigate}} a general relativistic mechanism in which spikes generate matter overdensities {{in the early}} universe.

We find that <b>the</b> <b>tilt</b> plays <b>the</b> primary role in generating matter inhomogeneities, and it does so by creating both local over-densities and underdensities. We discuss of the physical implications of the work. ...|$|R
5|$|Ganymede orbits Jupiter at a {{distance}} of 1,070,400km, third among the Galilean satellites, and completes a revolution every seven days and three hours. Like most known moons, Ganymede is tidally locked, with one side always facing toward the planet, hence its day is seven days and three hours. Its orbit is very slightly eccentric and inclined to the Jovian equator, with the eccentricity and inclination changing quasi-periodically due to solar and planetary gravitational perturbations on a timescale of centuries. The ranges of change are 0.0009–0.0022 and 0.05–0.32°, respectively. These orbital variations cause the axial <b>tilt</b> (<b>the</b> angle between rotational and orbital axes) to vary between 0 and 0.33°.|$|E
5|$|In {{the war for}} independence, the {{division}} of assimilados versus indigenas peoples masked the inter-ethnic conflict between the various native tribes, a division {{that emerged in the}} early 1970s. The Union of Peoples of Angola, the predecessor to the FNLA, only controlled 15% of Angola's territory during the independence war, excluding MPLA-controlled Cabinda. The People's Republic of China openly backed UNITA upon independence despite the mutual support from its adversary South Africa and UNITA's pro-Western <b>tilt.</b> <b>The</b> PRC's support for Savimbi came in 1965, a year after he left the FNLA. China saw Holden Roberto and the FNLA as the stooge of the West and the MPLA as the Soviet Union's proxy. With the Sino-Soviet split, South Africa presented the least odious of allies to the PRC.|$|E
5|$|The axial tilt of the Earth is {{approximately}} 23.439281° with {{the axis of}} its orbit plane, always pointing towards the Celestial Poles. Due to Earth's axial <b>tilt,</b> <b>the</b> amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies {{over the course of}} the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the Northern Hemisphere occurring when the Tropic of Cancer is facing the Sun, and winter taking place when the Tropic of Capricorn in the Southern Hemisphere faces the Sun. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter. In northern temperate latitudes, the Sun rises north of true east during the summer solstice, and sets north of true west, reversing in the winter. The Sun rises south of true east in the summer for the southern temperate zone and sets south of true west.|$|E

5|$|The {{player can}} use predatory tactics through stealthincluding silent takedowns, {{dropping}} from overhead perches and snatching enemies away, or using the explosive gel to knock foes off their feetto <b>tilt</b> <b>the</b> odds in their favor. Some areas feature sections {{that require the}} player to use these tactics to avoid alerting the Joker's henchmen and thus failing to meet an objective. Many areas feature stone gargoyles placed high above, helping Batman remain concealed. Batman can use his grapnel gun to reach the gargoyles, giving him a high vantage point over the area and the enemies. From the gargoyles, Batman can glide down to attack enemies or hang upside down from the gargoyles to grapple a nearby enemy and leave him tethered there. The player can use floor grates to attack from below, hide around corners, use batarangs to stun enemies from afar, and use the grapnel gun to pull enemies over ledges.|$|E
