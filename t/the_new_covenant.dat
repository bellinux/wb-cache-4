5|$|With {{some notable}} exceptions, Reformed Christians baptize infants who {{are born to}} believing parents. Reformed Christians do so {{on the basis of}} the {{continuity}} from the old covenant between God and Israel and <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>covenant</b> with the church, since infants were circumcised under the old covenant. They also see God's saving purpose in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>covenant</b> as having to do with families as well as individuals. Because Reformed Christians believe baptism must be embraced by faith to have any benefit, they recognize that faith may come later in life rather than preceding baptism. Infants may also be said to possess a seed of faith which will come to fruition later, or baptism may be administered based on a promise of faith offered by their sponsors (usually their parents) which will be kept at a later age.|$|E
5|$|In Christian theology, {{the work}} of the Holy Spirit under the Old Covenant is viewed as less {{extensive}} than that under <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Covenant</b> inaugurated on the day of Pentecost. The Spirit was restricted to certain chosen individuals, such as high priests and prophets. Often termed the “spirit of prophecy” in rabbinic writings, the Holy Spirit was closely associated with prophecy and divine inspiration. It was anticipated that in the future messianic age God would pour out his spirit upon all of Israel, which would become a nation of prophets.|$|E
5|$|In {{keeping with}} their history, the Churches of Christ claim the New Testament as their sole rule {{of faith and}} {{practice}} in deciding matters of doctrine and ecclesiastical structure. They view the Old Testament as divinely inspired and historically accurate, {{but they do not}} consider its laws to be binding under <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Covenant</b> in Christ (unless they are repeated in the New Testament) (Hebrews 8: 7-13). They believe that the New Testament demonstrates how a person may become a Christian (and thus a part of the universal Church of Christ) and how a church should be collectively organized and carry out its scriptural purposes.|$|E

50|$|Other Protestant {{groups that}} {{have been accused of}} antinomianism include the Anabaptists and Mennonites. The Ranters of 17th century England were one of the most {{outright}} antinomian sects in the history of Christianity. <b>New</b> <b>Covenant</b> Theology has been accused of antinomianism for their belief that the Ten Commandments have been abrogated, but they point out that nine of these ten are renewed under <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Covenant's</b> Law of Christ.|$|R
5|$|The {{second book}} {{includes}} several essays on original sin {{and the fall}} of man, which directly refer to Augustine, who developed these doctrines. He often cited the Church Fathers in order to defend the reformed cause against the charge that the reformers were creating new theology. In Calvin's view, sin began {{with the fall of}} Adam and propagated to all of humanity. The domination of sin is complete to the point that people are driven to evil. Thus fallen humanity is in need of the redemption that can be found in Christ. But before Calvin expounded on this doctrine, he described the special situation of the Jews who lived {{during the time of the}} Old Testament. God made a covenant with Abraham, promising the coming of Christ. Hence, the Old Covenant was not in opposition to Christ, but was rather a continuation of God's promise. Calvin then describes <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Covenant</b> using the passage from the Apostles' Creed that describes Christ's suffering under Pontius Pilate and his return to judge the living and the dead. For Calvin, the whole course of Christ's obedience to the Father removed the discord between humanity and God.|$|E
25|$|Another {{difference}} is {{between those who}} believe <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Covenant</b> has already substantially arrived (Preterists), and that this knowledge of God that the member of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Covenant</b> has is primarily salvific knowledge; and those that believe that <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Covenant</b> has not yet substantially arrived, but will in the Second Coming, and that this knowledge is more complete knowledge, meaning a member of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Covenant</b> no longer has to be taught anything at all regarding the Christian life (not just that they lack need for exhortation regarding salvific reconciliation with God).|$|E

25|$|The Christian view of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Covenant</b> {{is a new}} {{relationship}} between God and humans mediated by Jesus which necessarily includes all people, both Jews and Gentiles, upon sincere declaration that one believes in Jesus Christ as Lord and God. <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Covenant</b> also breaks the generational curse of the original sin on all children of Adam if they believe in Jesus Christ, after people are judged for their own sins, {{which is expected to}} happen with the second arrival of Jesus Christ.|$|E

50|$|Some Christians {{adhere to}} <b>New</b> <b>Covenant</b> theology, {{which states that}} {{with the arrival of}} his <b>New</b> <b>Covenant,</b> Jews have ceased being blessed under his Mosaic covenant. This {{position}} has been softened or disputed by other Christians, where Jews are recognized to have a special status under <b>the</b> Abrahamic <b>covenant.</b> <b>New</b> <b>Covenant</b> theology is thus in contrast to Dual-covenant theology.|$|R
25|$|Supersessionism is {{the view}} that <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Covenant</b> replaces, {{fulfills}} or completes God's prior covenants with the Israelites. The most common alternatives to Supersessionism are abrogation of old covenant laws and dual covenant theology.|$|E
25|$|Pre-eminent {{among the}} saints is the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God. In Orthodox theology, the Mother of God is the {{fulfillment}} of the Old Testament archetypes revealed in the Ark of the Covenant (because she carried <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Covenant</b> {{in the person of}} Christ) and the burning bush that appeared before Moses (symbolizing the Mother of God's carrying of God without being consumed). Accordingly, the Orthodox consider Mary to be the Ark of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Covenant</b> and give her the respect and reverence as such. The Theotokos was chosen by God and she freely co-operated in that choice to be the Mother of Jesus Christ, the God-man.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Covenant</b> is {{a biblical}} {{interpretation}} originally {{derived from a}} phrase in the Book of Jeremiah, in the Hebrew Scriptures. It is often thought of as an eschatological Messianic Age or world to come and {{is related to the}} biblical concept of the Kingdom of God.|$|E

25|$|Christians {{predominantly}} profess {{that through}} Jesus' life, death, and resurrection, he restored humanity's communion with God {{with the blood}} of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Covenant.</b> His death on a cross is understood as a redemptive sacrifice: the source of humanity's salvation and the atonement for sin which had entered human history through the sin of Adam.|$|E
25|$|Following in the Pauline tradition, in the 5th century Augustine of Hippo viewed Christ as the {{mediator}} of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Covenant</b> between God and man {{and as the}} conqueror over sin. He viewed Christ as the cause and reason for the reconciliation of man with God {{after the fall of}} Adam, and he saw in Christ the path to Christian salvation. Augustine believed that salvation is available to those who are worthy of it, through faith in Christ.|$|E
25|$|Thus as the Apostle Paul advises {{that the}} Mosaic Covenant of Sinai {{does not in}} itself prevent Jews from sinning and dying, and is not given to Gentiles at all (only the Noahic {{covenant}} is unique in applying to all humanity), Christians believe <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Covenant</b> ends the original sin and death for everyone who becomes a Christian and cannot simply be a renewal of the Mosaic Covenant since it seemingly accomplishes new things. See types of Supersessionism for details.|$|E

25|$|Piper {{does not}} don {{any of the}} typical hermeneutical frameworks, but claims he is furthest from dispensationalism, and closest to Covenant Theology, or a New Covenant Theology in matters of the Law and covenants, but agrees with the dispensationalist belief {{that there will be}} a millennium. He says that the Law was meant by God to reveal sin and show man's {{inability}} to live up to God's righteous standards. Christians, living under <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Covenant,</b> are not under the Old Covenant law but able to fulfill its intent through faith in Jesus Christ.|$|E
25|$|The {{literal sense}} {{pertains}} {{to the meaning of}} the words themselves, including any figurative meanings. The spiritual senses pertain to the significance of the things (persons, places, objects or events) denoted by the words. Of the three spiritual senses, the allegorical sense is foundational. It relates persons, events, and institutions of earlier covenants to those of later covenants, and especially to <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Covenant.</b> Building on the allegorical sense, the moral sense instructs in regard to action, and the anagogical sense points to man's final destiny. The teaching of the Catechism on Scripture has encouraged the recent pursuit of covenantal theology, an approach that employs the four senses to structure salvation history via the biblical covenants.|$|E
