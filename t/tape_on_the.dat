5|$|The friends {{decide to}} watch the video, {{although}} Ross objects to everyone seeing the <b>tape.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> video, Rachel's date, Chip Matthews, has not arrived, and Monica refuses {{to go to the}} prom without her. Mrs. Geller convinces Ross to wear his father's tuxedo and take Rachel to the prom himself. Ross reluctantly agrees, {{but by the time he}} is dressed and ready to go, Chip has arrived and the girls leave. The video ends with Ross looking disappointed and dejected. Rachel, touched by Ross's gesture, gets up and kisses Ross, forgiving him for what happened between them. Monica later watches the video alone which features her and her father, Jack, dancing. The video then shows Monica and Ross's parents in bed, which disgusts her.|$|E

500|$|When {{discussing}} Tumbling Dice, {{recording engineer}} Andy Johns stated, that {{recording of the}} song was [...] "like pulling teeth" [...] due to the {{extended period of time}} it took to get a satisfactory take. Johns has claimed that there were between thirty and one hundred reels of <b>tape</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> base track of the song. Some have said that it may have taken as many as 150 takes to get the basic track of the song.

I know they did." ...|$|E

500|$|The Civil Engineering Department {{published}} {{two independent}} reports in March 1998 revealing that the upkeep of the hillside overlooking the monastery was inadequate. [...] This was partially {{attributed to the}} government's method of cutting slopes. [...] The incident resulted in {{the closure of the}} Monastery for three years to carry out repair work on the surrounding slopes in three stages. [...] Each phase cost more than HK$1.5 million – this outlay was covered by donations from the public, since the Monastery does not charge an admission fee for visitors. [...] The lay custodians eventually requested HK$6 million. [...] By March 2000, two small slopes had been overhauled, but work on the larger, more dangerous slopes had yet to begin. [...] The Monastery blamed excessive red <b>tape</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> part of the Buildings Department for putting off approval of the reconstruction works. [...] Although the temple was partially opened again {{a few months after the}} mudslide, the entire complex was not reopened until July 31, 2000.

2500|$|The {{second half}} {{settled down to}} the top three {{championship}} contenders: Allison, Elliott, and Kulwicki. Around lap 118, rookie Jeff Gordon made a pit stop. The Ray Evernham-led [...] "Rainbow Warriors" [...] crew were still unrefined, and made many mistakes. Evernham himself referred to them as the bumbling [...] "Keystone Kops." [...] The crew accidentally left a roll of duct <b>tape</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hood, and it fell off out on the track. Davey Allison, running second, hit the debris and suffered a damaged front air dam. He lost several positions and {{the handling of the}} car was affected.|$|E
2500|$|On October 15, 2008, Wallenda {{performed}} on a live broadcast of Today. The {{plan was to}} walk and then bicycle off {{the roof of the}} Prudential Center in Downtown Newark, New Jersey, across a suspended high-wire 13 and 1/2 stories (135feet) above the ground. Starting at 8:30am, he first walked across the [...] cable with a [...] balancing pole. Halfway through, {{he sat down on the}} wire and called the Today show hosts. [...] "Where are you?" [...] he asked, joking that he was expecting to carry one of the show's hosts across the wire on his shoulder. Sitting down on the wire is easy, he said, it is getting back up that is tricky. A few steps before completing the walk, Wallenda stopped and waved to the crowd. When he resumed, he wobbled and had to bend his knees to regain balance. [...] "I actually slipped," [...] he said later. [...] "I lost focus there for a moment" [...] because of some unexpected <b>tape</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wire. He completed the walk in about five minutes.|$|E
2500|$|In ice hockey, a pass is the {{movement}} of the puck from one player to another, usually by a motion of the stick. [...] A pass differs from a shot, in that a pass is typically weaker than a shot and is not directed at the opponent's net with the intention of scoring a goal. [...] The function of passing in ice hockey during gameplay strongly resembles the role of passing in other goal sports such as soccer and lacrosse. [...] Passing (along with skating, shooting, and stick handling) {{is one of the most}} fundamental skills in hockey. An effective pass is described as being [...] "stick to stick" [...] or [...] "tape to tape", referring to the <b>tape</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> blade of a hockey stick. [...] Effective passing requires good vision, anticipation, and timing. [...] A player that is an effective passer will normally record many assists, which are awarded to the second and third to last player to touch the puck before a goal. [...] The National Hockey League record for most career assists is 1,963 by Wayne Gretzky, who is considered one of the best passers of all time.|$|E

6000|$|There is a {{great variety}} of {{suggestions}} for this increase of public wealth and production. Many of them have an extreme reasonableness. The extent to which they will be adopted depends, no doubt, very largely upon the politician and permanent official, and both these classes are prone to panic in the presence of reality. In spite of its own interests in restraining a rise in prices, the old official [...] "salariat" [...] is likely to be obstructive to any such innovations. It is the resistance of spurs and red tabs to military innovations over again. This is the resistance of quills and red <b>tape.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand the organisation of Britain for war has [...] "officialised" [...] a number of industrial leaders, and created a large body of temporary and adventurous officials. They may want to carry on into peace production the great new factories the war has created. At the end of the war, for example, every belligerent country will be in urgent need of cheap automobiles for farmers, tradesmen, and industrial purposes generally, America is now producing such automobiles at a price of eighty pounds. But Europe will be heavily in debt to America, her industries will be disorganised, and there will therefore be no sort of return payment possible for these hundreds of thousands of automobiles. A country that is neither creditor nor producer cannot be an importer. Consequently though those cheap tin cars may be stacked as high as the Washington Monument in America, they will never come to Europe. On the other hand the great shell factories of Europe will be standing idle and ready, their staffs disciplined and available, for conversion to the new task. The imperative common sense of the position seems to be that the European governments should set themselves straight away to out-Ford Ford, and provide their own people with cheap road transport.|$|E
60|$|Each {{of these}} sorts of men, in just so far as he is {{concerned}} with the reality of his profession, in just so far as he is worthy of his profession, must resent the considerations of private profit, of base economies, that constantly limit and spoil his work and services in the interests of a dividend or of some financial manœuvre. So far they have been antagonized towards Socialism by the errors of its adherents, by the impression quite wantonly created, that Socialism meant either mob rule or the rule of pedantic, unsympathetic officials. They have heard too much of democracy, too much of bureaucracy, and not enough of construction. They have felt that on the whole the financial exploiter, detestable master as he often is, was better than the rule of either clamour on the one hand or red <b>tape</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other. But, as I have been seeking to suggest, mob rule and official rule do not exhaust the possible alternatives. Neither ignorant democracy nor narrow bureaucracy can be the destined rulers of a Socialist State. The only conceivable rule in a Socialist civilization is through the operation of a collective mind that must be by its nature constructive and enterprising, because only through the creation of such a mind can Socialism be brought about. A Socialist State cannot exist without that mind existing also, and a collective mind can scarcely appear without some form of Socialism giving it a material body. Now it is only under an intelligent collective mind that any of the dreams of these constructive professions can attain an effective realization. Where will the private profit in a universal sanitation, for example, be found, in the abolition of diseases, in the planned control of the public health, in the abolition of children's deaths? What thought of private gain will ever scrap our obsolescent railroads and our stagnating industrial monopolies for new clean methods? So long as they pay a dividend they will keep on upon their present lines. The modern architect knows, the engineer knows we might build ourselves perfectly clean, smokeless magnificent cities to-day, as full of pure water as ancient Rome, as full of pure air as the Engadine, if private ownership did not block the way. Who can doubt it who understands what a doctor, or an electrical engineer, or a real architect understands? Surely all the best men in these professions are eager to get to work on the immense possibilities of life, possibilities of things cleared up, of things made anew, that their training has enabled them to visualize! What stands in their way, stands in our way; social disorganization, individualist self-seeking, narrowness of outlook, self-conceit, ignorance.|$|E
