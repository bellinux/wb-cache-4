Analogously, collective intelligence research aims to explore reasons why certain groups perform more intelligent than other groups given that c is just moderately correlated with the intelligence of individual group members.

However, they claim that three factors were found as significant correlates: <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of speaking turns, group members' average social sensitivity {{and the proportion of}} females.

25|$|The models {{described}} {{on this page}} describe {{the evolution of a}} single site within a set of sequences. They are often used for analyzing the evolution of an entire locus by making the simplifying assumption that different sites evolve independently and are identically distributed. This assumption may be justifiable if the sites can be assumed to be evolving neutrally. If the primary effect of natural selection on the evolution of the sequences is to constrain some sites, then models of among-site rate-heterogeneity can be used. This approach allows one to estimate only one matrix of relative rates of substitution, and another set of parameters describing <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> total rate of substitution across sites.|$|E
