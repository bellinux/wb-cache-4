40|$|Abstract—Generation of {{high-quality}} drive paths {{is a significant}} issue for automated wheeled vehicles. To achieve this aim for a truck and <b>trailer</b> <b>vehicle,</b> the paper proposes {{the use of a}} parame-terized curve primitive, the-spline. Using this spline, generation and shaping of smooth feasible paths is made possible as well as the transfer between arbitrary dynamic configurations of the articu-lated vehicle. The-spline is a ninth-order polynomial curve that can interpolate given Cartesian points with associated arbitrary unit tangent vector, curvature, and first and second derivatives of curvature. It depends on a set of eight (eta) parameters that can be freely chosen to modify the path shape without changing the in-terpolations conditions at the path endpoints. Completeness, mini-mality, and symmetry of the-spline are established. An example on a parking maneuver of the articulated vehicle is presented and the pertinent optimal path planning is also discussed...|$|E
25|$|It {{was decided}} to convert the {{vehicles}} from the many redundant Class 307 vehicles that were stored at various locations around the country.

50|$|To operate {{electric}} services 24 {{motor and}} 33 trailer carriages were constructed of Baldwin-Westinghouse design. They were 60 ft long, of an American styling, and were manufactured at the Baldwin Locomotive Works in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Four additional <b>trailer</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{of the same}} design were built during 1908 by G. C. Milnes Voss & Company in Birkenhead. The electric Mersey Railway trains all used a multiple unit control system developed by Westinghouse which enabled trains with motor carriages at both ends to be driven from a single cab. From 1904, driving controls were also fitted to selected <b>trailer</b> <b>vehicles</b> which enabled trains to be divided into shorter units during quieter times, yet still be drivable from both ends. Additional vehicles {{were added to the}} fleet in 1925 and 1925, constructed by Cravens of Sheffield, and in 1936, built by the Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{considers}} a transportation problem for moving empty or laden containers for a logistic company. A model for this truck and <b>trailer</b> <b>vehicle</b> routing problem (TTVRP) is first {{constructed in the}} paper. The solution to the TTVRP consists of finding a complete routing schedule for serving the jobs with minimum routing distance and number of trucks, subject {{to a number of}} constraints such as time windows and availability of trailers. To solve such a multiobjective and multi-modal combinatorial optimization problem, a hybrid multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (HMOEA) is applied to find the Pareto optimal routing solutions for the TTVRP. Detailed analysis is performed to extract useful decision-making information from the multiobjective optimization results The computational results have shown that the HMOEA is effective for solving multiobjective combinatorial problems, such as finding useful trade-off solutions for the TTVRP. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCourier, Express & Parcel (CEP) {{providers}} {{benefit from}} constantly {{increasing amounts of}} single shipments. But in urban areas problems appear with the delivery. These are amongst others limited efficiency, disturbance of moving traffic and pedestrians and difficulties to comply with environmental and traffic regulations. Many of these problems are caused by use of conventional cars and vans {{due to the lack}} of specialized solutions. Therefore our approach for improvement is an optimized vehicle concept. Core of this vehicle is an electrically driven uniaxial transport unit, the “MicroCarrier”. It is designed for application both as part of a multiple <b>trailer</b> <b>vehicle</b> and as single electrically powered transport unit for hand-guided manoeuvre. An experimental vehicle of the transport system was built and tested. The next step intended is execution of field tests involving logistic companies and local governments...|$|E
40|$|Accounting for {{transportation}} {{is an important}} part of the life cycle analysis (LCA) of beef cattle production because it is associated with energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This paper describes the development and application of a model that estimates energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of transport in beef cattle production. The animal transport model is based on the weight and number of animals in each weight category, type of <b>trailer,</b> <b>vehicle,</b> and fuel used. The energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission estimates of animal feed transportation are based on the weight of a truckload and the number of truckloads of feed transported. Our results indicate that a truckload is travelling approximately 326 km in connection with beef cattle production in the study region. The fuel consumption amounts to 24 L of fossil fuel per 1000 kg of boneless beef. The corresponding greenhouse gas emission is 83 kg. It appears from our results that the majority of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions are associated with sending the finished cattle to slaughterhouses and bringing feeder cattle to feedlots. Our results point out appreciable reductions in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by changing from conventional fuel to bio-fuel...|$|E
