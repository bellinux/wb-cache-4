She was a proponent and follower of the teaching philosophy of Friedrich Fröbel. Smith incorporated Fröbel's ideas that childhood is a universal experience in which children learn by imitation, using their natural abilities. Her compositions also recognized that children learn by movement and play, but have limited attention spans. Thus, the compositions she created were usually short melodies, with limited vocal ranges, and were easy to sing. The songs were in major keys, typically C, F, and G and extended only from C1 to F2. Most melodies were made in stepped triads and provided pauses for activity. For example, in her song [...] "The Wind Mill" [...] there is an eight measure rest {{for the children to}} make the motions of the <b>turning</b> <b>blades.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Carat {{is powered}} by an air-cooled, four cylinder, Volkswagen derived, 40 kW (54 hp) Sauer S1800 piston engine. This drives the unique feature of the Carat, its folding two blade propeller: the blades fold forward like spears to {{minimize}} drag when the engine is off. This {{is in contrast to}} other motorgliders which mostly either store the propeller inside the fuselage, or merely feather the propeller blades. The Carat's propeller is opened by the centrifugal force on the <b>turning</b> <b>blades,</b> working against a folding force provided by a gas damping spring mechanism. [...] This folding mechanism has the advantage of simplicity, but it means that the engine can not be windmill-started if the battery is flat. Because of the forward pointing blades when the engine is off, the Carat cannot be towed aloft like traditional sailplanes.|$|E

50|$|At 08:30, two {{lifeboats}} {{from the}} boat station assigned to Third Officer Francis Laws were lowered, without his knowledge, {{through the use of}} the automatic release gear. Those two lifeboats dropped some 6 ft and hit the water violently. The two lifeboats soon drifted back into the still-turning propellers, which were beginning to rise out of the water due to the water flooding into the front of the ship. As they reached the <b>turning</b> <b>blades,</b> both lifeboats, together with their occupants, were torn to pieces. Word of the carnage arrived on the bridge, and Captain Bartlett, seeing that water was entering more rapidly as Britannic was moving and that there was a risk of more victims, gave the order to stop the engines. The propellers stopped turning the moment a third lifeboat was about to be reduced to splinters. RAMC occupants of this boat pushed against the blades and got away from them safely.|$|E
