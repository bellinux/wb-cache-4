2500|$|The exact {{birth date}} of Gallienus is unknown. [...] The Greek chronicler John Malalas and the Epitome de Caesaribus {{report that he}} was about 50 {{years old at the time}} of his death, meaning he was born around 218. He was the son of emperor Valerian and Mariniana, who may have been of senatorial rank, {{possibly}} the daughter of Egnatius Victor Marinianus, and his brother was Valerianus Minor. Inscriptions on coins connect him with Falerii in Etruria, which may have been his birthplace; it has yielded many inscriptions relating to his mother's family, the Egnatii. [...] Gallienus married Cornelia Salonina about ten years before his accession to the throne.

2500|$|In October 2002, Frieda Hanimov, an Israeli émigré nurse, {{called a}} hotline at the District Attorney's (DA's) Office. <b>The</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>three,</b> {{was at the}} time embroiled in a bitter child-custody dispute that was being heard by Judge Garson. She complained that she had been told that her husband, Yuri Hanimov, had bribed the judge to fix their case, and that he had done so through Nissim Elmann (reputedly a [...] "fixer", who {{arranged}} bribes in divorce and custody cases) and Paul Siminovsky (the divorce lawyer whom Garson had appointed as law guardian for her children). The woman had learned this when she herself met with Elmann, seeking to bribe Garson.

Within days, the DA's Office had her wearing a wire, meeting with and secretly taping Elmann.|$|E
2500|$|One of the captives was {{a nine-year-old}} girl, Cynthia Ann Parker, {{daughter}} of Silas and Lucinda (Duty) Parker. Cynthia Ann {{lived with the}} Comanches for nearly 25 years. She married Comanche chief Peta Nocona and was <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> children, including Quanah Parker. In 1860, she was among a Native American party captured by Texas Rangers at the Battle of Pease River. [...] Ironically, Cynthia Parker {{was the victim of}} two massacres which destroyed her life. [...] The first, the attack on Fort Parker in 1836, killed her father and left her among the Comanche for nearly 25 years. [...] The second, a massacre of the Comanche Band of her husband, the Noconis, at the Battle of Pease River left her a prisoner among the whites. She was identified by her uncle, Isaac Parker, and returned to her family. Cynthia Ann never readjusted to the Anglo society, and {{died at the age of}} 43 in 1870 after starving herself to death after her daughter, Prairie Flower, had caught influenza and died from pneumonia.

2500|$|In {{the dead}} {{of the night in}} secret, Táhirih was taken to the nearby garden Ilkhani in Tehran, and with her own veil was strangled to death. Her body was thrown into a shallow well and stones thrown upon it. A {{prominent}} Bábí, and subsequently Bahá'í, historian cites the wife of an officer who had the chance to know her that she was strangled by a drunken officer of the government with her own veil which she had chosen for her anticipated martyrdom. One of her most notable quotes is her final utterance, [...] "You can kill me as soon as you like, but you cannot stop the emancipation of women." [...] She was then aged about 35, and was <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> children. [...] Dr Jakob Eduard Polak, the Shah's physician, was an eye-witness to the execution and described it as: [...] "I was witness to the execution of Qurret el ayn, who was executed by the war minister and his adjutants; the beautiful woman endured her slow death with superhuman fortitude". `Abdu'l-Bahá eulogized Táhirih writing that she was a [...] "woman chaste and holy, a sign and token of surpassing beauty, a burning brand of the love of God".

2500|$|Lydia Jannsen {{was born}} in Fennern (present-day Vändra), [...] Governorate of Livonia, Russian Empire. The family moved to the nearby county town of Pernau (present-day Pärnu) in 1850 where, in 1857, her father started the first local Estonian {{language}} newspaper and where Lydia attended the German grammar school. The Jannsens moved to the university town of Dorpat (present-day Tartu) in 1864. Nationalism, including publication in indigenous languages, was a very touchy subject in the Russian Empire but {{the rule of the}} Emperor Alexander II (1855–1881) was relatively liberal and Jannsen managed to persuade the imperial censorship to allow him to publish the first national Estonian language newspaper in 1864. Both the Pärnu local and the national newspaper were called Postimees (The Courier). Lydia wrote for her father on both papers besides publishing her own work. In 1873 she married Eduard Michelson, a Livonian army physician, and moved to Kronstadt, the headquarters of the Russian navy near St. Petersburg. In 1876–78 the Michelsons visited Breslau, Strasbourg and Vienna. Koidula lived in Kronstadt for 13 years but despite spending her summers in Estonia, she never stopped feeling inconsolably homesick. Lydia Koidula was <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> children. She died on August 11, 1886 after a long and painful illness. Her last poem was Enne surma- Eestimaale!

Her son, Andrew, took over leadership of Otstonwakin upon her death in the late 1740s. Andrew inherited his mother’s gift for languages. He spoke French, English, Lenape, Shawnee, and the Iroquoian languages. Comfortable with both Native Americans and Europeans, he made a good living as a translator for both settlers and local tribes. In 1742 when Count Zinzendorf met Montour, he wrote that Montour looked [...] "decidedly European, and had his face not been encircled with a broad band of paint we would have thought he was one." [...] He also {{served as a}} translator with Conrad Weiser and Chief Shikellamy. He was granted [...] of land by the Province of Pennsylvania in the Montoursville area. He was later appointed as a captain in George Washington's army at Fort Necessity during the French and Indian War.
