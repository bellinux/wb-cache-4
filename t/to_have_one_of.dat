5|$|Demand for Juventus {{tickets in}} {{occasional}} home games held away from Turin is high, suggesting that Juventus have stronger support {{in other parts}} of the country.

5|$|The {{species is}} partly self-compatible, as some seed is set when pollinators are excluded. Selection against self-pollinated seed has been observed, but the species has {{nonetheless}} been shown <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the lowest outcrossing rates of any Banksia. This is probably {{caused by the}} small population sizes, which increase the probability of self-fertilisation, and may discourage visits by pollinators.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the breakup}} of the Soviet Union a few years earlier, the Russian economy had been slowly {{collapsing}} and the budget for space exploration was reduced by around 80%.

By the start of Phase One, cosmonauts regularly found their missions extended to save money on launchers, the six-yearly flights of the Progress had been reduced to three, and there was a distinct possibility of Mir being sold for around $500 million.|$|E

5|$|In the yeshiva world, the {{brightest}} students are highly desirable as chavrusas. However, there are {{pros and cons}} to learning with chavrusas who are stronger, weaker, or equal in knowledge and ability to the student. A stronger chavrusa will correct and fill in the student's knowledge and help him improve his learning techniques, acting more like a teacher. With a chavrusa who is equal in knowledge and ability, the student is forced to prove his point with logic rather than by right of seniority, which improves his ability to think logically, analyze other people's opinions objectively, and accept criticism. With a weaker chavrusa, who often worries over and questions each step, the student is forced to understand the material thoroughly, refine and organize his thoughts in a logical structure, present his viewpoint clearly, {{and be ready to}} justify each and every point. The stronger chavrusa helps the student acquire a great deal of information, but the weaker chavrusa helps the student learn how to learn. Yeshiva students are usually advised <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> each of these three types of chavrusas in order to develop on all three levels.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of Keeper of the Archives at the University of Oxford dates from 1634. The university's records pre-date this, and it claims <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the longest continuous record-keeping traditions in Britain. Records were initially {{kept in the}} Priory of St Frideswide (the site of the present-day Christ Church), moving to the University Church of St Mary the Virgin in the 14th century, where they were housed with money and other valuables. The archives were left in considerable disarray by a burglary in 1544, and remained in chaos until Brian Twyne attended {{to them in the}} 17th century. As part of his work {{as a member of the}} committee preparing new statutes for the university (at the request of the Chancellor of the University, William Laud), Twyne prepared an index of the archives by 1631, and was appointed the first Keeper of the Archives under the revised statutes in 1634 as a reward for his work. Under Twyne and Gerard Langbaine, his successor as Keeper, the archives were moved into one of the rooms in the Tower of the Five Orders in the Bodleian Library; three of the wooden cupboards that were built at that time to store them are still in use.|$|E
