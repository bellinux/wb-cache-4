5|$|Between 1905 and 1907, Taft came {{to terms}} with the {{likelihood}} he would be the next Republican nominee for president, though he did not plan to actively campaign for it. When Justice Henry B. Brown resigned in 1905, Taft would not accept the seat although Roosevelt offered it, a position Taft held to when another seat opened in 1906. Edith Roosevelt, the First Lady, disliked the growing closeness between the two men, feeling that they were too much alike and that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> gain much from the advice of someone who rarely contradicted him.|$|E
5|$|Harding's Socialist {{opponent}} in the 1920 election, Eugene Debs, was serving a ten-year sentence in the Atlanta Penitentiary for speaking against the war. Wilson had refused to pardon him before leaving office. Daugherty met with Debs, and was deeply impressed. There was opposition from veterans, including the American Legion, and also from Florence Harding. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> feel he could release Debs until the war was officially over, but once the peace treaties were signed commuted Debs' sentence on December 23, 1921. At Harding's request, Debs visited the president at the White House before going home to Indiana.|$|E

5|$|On May 19, 1865, President Andrew Johnson {{nominated}} Edwards to {{the full}} grade of brigadier general, United States Volunteers, to rank from May 19, 1865. However, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> present the nomination of Edwards for the promotion to the U. S. Senate until January 13, 1866. Although Edwards had been mustered out of the U.S. Volunteers on January 15, 1866, the Senate confirmed the promotion on February 23, 1866. On July 9, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Edwards for the award of the honorary grade of brevet major general, United States Volunteers, to rank from April 5, 1865, for capturing Confederate Lieutenant General Richard S. Ewell, Major General Custis Lee, (son of Robert E. Lee), who was captured by David Dunnels White of the 37th Massachusetts Regiment, {{which was part of}} Oliver Edwards' command, and an entire brigade of Confederate soldiers at the Battle of Sayler's Creek, Virginia during the Appomattox Campaign. The U.S. Senate confirmed the award on July 23, 1866.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's negotiators {{hoped to}} reach a truce in Vietnam prior to the election. Nixon {{received}} astute analysis on the talks from Henry Kissinger, then a consultant to U.S. negotiator Averell Harriman, and his campaign was in regular contact with Anna Chennault (at a July 1968 meeting in Nixon's New York apartment with South Vietnamese ambassador Bùi Diễm, he had been informed that Chennault would represent Nixon during the campaign). She advised South Vietnamese president Thieu {{not to go to}} Paris to join the talks, hinting that Nixon would give him a better deal if elected. Johnson was aware of what was going on, as he had both Chennault and the South Vietnamese ambassador to Washington bugged, and was enraged by what he considered an attempt by Nixon to undermine U.S. foreign policy. On October 31, with no agreement, Johnson announced a unilateral halt to the bombing, and that peace negotiations would start in Paris on November 6, the day after Election Day. On November 2, after speaking with Chennault again, Thieu stated he would not go to Paris. Johnson telephoned Nixon, who denied any involvement; <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> believe him. Johnson felt he could not publicly mention Chennault's involvement, which had been obtained by wiretapping, but told Humphrey, who chose not to use the information.|$|E

Tennessee Attorney General Herbert H. Slatery III subsequently reversed his position and withdrew his participation from the proposed suit on August 31.

In 1995, Roger Clinton unsuccessfully lobbied officials for parole for Rosario Gambino. In 1999 when the president was prepared to decide who would be pardoned before his final days in office, Gambino's name was on the list for consideration. Ultimately, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> grant Gambino a pardon.|$|E
25|$|The {{constitutional}} crisis of 1993 {{was a political}} stand-off between the Russian president Boris Yeltsin and the Russian parliament that was resolved by using military force. The relations {{between the president and}} the parliament had been deteriorating for some time. The {{constitutional crisis}} reached a tipping point on September21, 1993, when President Yeltsin aimed to dissolve the country's legislature (the Congress of People's Deputies and its Supreme Soviet), although <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have the power to dissolve the parliament according to the constitution. Yeltsin used the results of the referendum of April 1993 to justify his actions.

25|$|On 20 July 1996, Qazi Hussain Ahmed of Jamaat e Islami {{announced}} to start protests against government alleging corruption. Qazi Hussain resigned from senate on 27 September and {{announced to}} start long march against Benazir government. Protest started on 27 October 1996 by Jamaat e Islami and opposition parties. On 4 November 1996, Bhutto's government was dismissed by President Leghari {{primarily because of}} corruption, who used the Eighth Amendment discretionary powers to dissolve the government. Benazir was surprised when she discovered {{that it was not}} the military who had dismissed her but her own hand-picked puppet President who had used the power to dismiss her. She turned to the Supreme Court hoping for gaining Leghari's actions unconstitutional. But the Supreme Court justified and affirmed President Leghari's dismissal in a 6–1 ruling.

25|$|On 4 April 2011, the Court of Appeal {{dismissed}} {{an appeal}} filed by Yong against the judgment. It affirmed the High Court's view that <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> possess any personal discretion when exercising the clemency power, and {{was required to}} act in accordance with Cabinet's advice on the matter. This conclusion was evident from the wording of Article 22P(1) of the Constitution, the legislative history of the clemency power in Singapore, relevant case law, {{and the nature of}} the President's power in the Constitution. The Court also noted that both Yong and the Attorney-General agreed that the power of clemency was vested exclusively in the executive and was not justiciable on the merits, because of the doctrine of separation of powers and established administrative law principles. Nonetheless, the use of the power could be judicially reviewed if it was exercised in bad faith for an extraneous purpose, or in a way that contravened constitutional protections and rights. In addition, the Court was of the opinion that the clemency process could not be regarded as having been tainted by a reasonable suspicion of bias due to the Law Minister's remarks. The Minister had merely been setting out the Government's policy of taking a tough approach towards serious drug trafficking offences by imposing a mandatory death penalty as a deterrent. In any case, the rule against bias should not be applied to ministers making public statements on government policy in the same way as it applies to judicial or quasi-judicial officers, otherwise no minister would be able to speak on any policy in public or in Parliament without the statement being regarded as a predetermination of any decision relating to the policy that might have to be made subsequently. Even if the Law Minister's statements indicated that he intended not to grant clemency to Yong, this predetermination could not be attributed to other Cabinet ministers. The alternative view was untenable, as it would mean that once any minister spoke about the Government's policy on the death penalty in a way that showed predetermination of the issue, the entire Cabinet would be disentitled from advising the President on how he should exercise the clemency power.|$|E

Early 1905 saw {{futility}} for Hay, as a number of treaties he had negotiated were defeated or amended by the Senate—one involving the British dominion of Newfoundland due to Senator Lodge's fears it would harm his fisherman constituents. Others, promoting arbitration, were voted down or amended because the Senate {{did not want to be}} bypassed in the settlement of international disputes.|$|E
500|$|President Reagan professed that he {{was unaware}} of the plot's existence. He opened his own {{investigation}} and appointed two Republicans and one Democrat (John Tower, Brent Scowcroft and Edmund Muskie, known as the [...] "Tower Commission") to investigate the scandal. The commission could not find direct evidence that Reagan had prior knowledge of the program, but criticized him heavily for his disengagement from managing his staff, making the diversion of funds possible. A separate report by Congress concluded that [...] "If <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> know what his national security advisers were doing, he should have."

2500|$|Most of the {{arguments}} that <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> possess soft power stem from a strict interpretation of the Constitution and what are regarded as the traditional roles of <b>the</b> <b>President.</b> First, unless <b>the</b> Constitution states otherwise, the default position is that when exercising his functions <b>the</b> <b>President</b> has to act according to {{the advice of the}} Cabinet. In the context of the Constitution, the word advice <b>does</b> <b>not</b> carry its typical meaning of mere opinion or suggestion. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> is obliged to follow the Cabinet's advice. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have any liberty to exercise soft power. Furthermore, {{it has been argued that}} since <b>the</b> <b>President</b> is elected to exercise the powers defined in the Constitution, the concept of [...] "political legitimacy" [...] posited by proponents would appear to be undermined by soft power, which has an unspecified and ambiguous scope.|$|R
500|$|Conservatives and isolationists {{had little}} {{enthusiasm for the}} Willkie campaign, and the moderates wanted to see {{stronger}} positions on progressive issues and foreign policy.

[...] (italics in original) Despite his pledge not to campaign, Roosevelt made inspection tours to military installations, well covered by the press. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> mention Willkie by name, seeking to avoid giving him publicity. [...] According to Susan Dunn in her book in the 1940 campaign, this forced Willkie [...] "to box against a phantom opponent and carry on a one-sided partisan debate... Even in Willkie's speeches, Roosevelt occupied center stage". Willkie promised to keep New Deal social welfare programs intact, expand Social Security, and provide full employment, a job for everyone: [...] "I pledge a new world".|$|E

When told by Webster {{that he was willing to}} stay, Tyler is reported to have said, [...] "Give me your hand on that, and now I will say to you that Henry Clay is a doomed man." [...] On September 13, when <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> resign or give in, the Whigs in Congress expelled Tyler from the party.

However, the new constitution and the National Union (a political union they founded) suspended the quarrels between M'ba and Aubame from 1961 to 1963. Despite this, political unrest grew within the population, and many students held demonstrations on the frequent dissolutions of the National Assembly and the general political attitude in the country. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> hesitate to enforce the law himself; with a chicotte, he whipped citizens who did not show respect for him, including passersby who [...] "forgot" [...] to salute him.|$|E
