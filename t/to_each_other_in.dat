5|$|A third {{possibility}} {{is where the}} primary and moon are tidally locked <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> <b>In</b> that case, the tidal bulge stays directly under the moon, there is no transfer of angular momentum, and the orbital period will not change.

5|$|Capella was the {{brightest}} star in the night sky from 210,000 years ago to 160,000 years ago, at about −1.8 in apparent magnitude.

5|$|The quarks {{are held}} {{together}} by the strong interaction (or strong force), which is mediated by gluons.

5|$|After the war, de Peyster served {{overseas}} as a dignitary. When {{he returned}} to the United States, he ran for office and was elected to the State Assembly. His father disagreed with many of his political positions, and they eventually stopped speaking <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> <b>In</b> 1900, the family feud culminated in a race for the office of Mayor of their native town, father running against son. After defeating his father, who owned the town hall, he was forced to move the Mayor's office to a new building. He died in 1903, survived by his three daughters.|$|E
5|$|Dust {{particles}} tend {{to stick}} <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> the dense disk environment, {{leading to the}} formation of larger particles up to several centimeters in size. The signatures of the dust processing and coagulation are observed in the infrared spectra of the young disks. Further aggregation can lead {{to the formation of}} planetesimals measuring 1km across or larger, which are the building blocks of planets. Planetesimal formation is another unsolved problem of disk physics, as simple sticking becomes ineffective as dust particles grow larger.|$|E

Francis and Santiago spent 1984 working in a warehouse, with Francis composing songs on his acoustic guitar and writing lyrics on the subway train.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{scientists}} reported {{detecting the}} spectral signatures of anthracene and pyrene in the ultraviolet light emitted by the Red Rectangle nebula (no other such complex molecules {{had ever been}} found before in outer space). This discovery was considered a confirmation of a hypothesis that as nebulae of the same type as the Red Rectangle approach the ends of their lives, convection currents cause carbon and hydrogen in the nebulae's core to get caught in stellar winds, and radiate outward. As they cool, the atoms supposedly bond <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> various ways and eventually form particles of a million or more atoms. The scientists inferred that since they discovered polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) — {{which may have been}} vital in the formation of early life on Earth — in a nebula, by necessity they must originate in nebulae.|$|E

5|$|Quatermass deduces that {{an alien}} {{life-form}} {{which comes from}} one of the moons of Saturn, which lives on ammonia, hydrogen and methane, but to which oxygen is a deadly poison, travels to earth in the meteorites, and in the few seconds they spend out of their shells before dying they possess human minds, and transmit knowledge <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> a collective consciousness. From this, they assume that it was the population of Winnderden Flats itself who demolished the village and built the plant. Quatermass decides that they can use the remaining Quatermass II rocket like a nuclear bomb and destroy the asteroid, much to Leo's protest at the rocket being unsafe to fly. Fowler tries to steal information about the other plants from the ministry, but is overcome and possessed by a makeshift meteorite hidden inside a filing cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Radstock had {{a second}} railway station on the Somerset & Dorset Joint Railway {{extension}} to Bath, which closed to passengers in 1966. The stations were adjacent <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> {{the centre of the}} town, and each had level crossings across the busy A367 road, causing long tailbacks at busy periods. The S line also carried substantial coal traffic. A spur from the Great Western line on to the S and continuing to Writhlington Colliery remained open for a few years after the railway's closure to passenger traffic, until the colliery closed in 1973.|$|E

It also holds the International Meeting of Póvoa de Varzim, in long course pool, part of the European winter calendar. The other complex is property of Clube Desportivo da Póvoa. The site also offers swimming lessons and some swimming pools, including a heated saltwater swimming pool filled with Póvoa de Varzim's seawater.|$|E

5|$|The nearest star to the Earth, {{apart from}} the Sun, is Proxima Centauri, which is 39.9 {{trillion}} kilometres, or 4.2 light-years. Travelling at the orbital speed of the Space Shuttle (8 kilometres per second—almost 30,000 kilometres per hour), it would take about 150,000 years to arrive. km / (3 × 104 km/h × 24 × 365.25) = 1.5 × 105 years. This is typical of stellar separations in galactic discs. Stars can be much closer <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> the centres of galaxies and in globular clusters, or much farther apart in galactic halos.|$|E
5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} was {{formerly}} often treated as the small, pale northern subspecies {{of the rock}} martin, but it is now usually {{considered to be a}} separate species. The changes in size and colour are continuous, so the evidence for separate species is not strong, although some rock martins can weigh {{more than twice as much}} as the smallest subspecies of the pale crag martin. The average weight for P.o.fusciventris is 22.4g (0.79oz) against 10g (0.35oz) for P.o.obsoleta. There do not appear to be any intermediate forms where pale crag martins and rock martin populations breed close <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> Somalia and Ethiopia.|$|E
5|$|The set of all {{solutions}} to a 2-satisfiability instance has {{the structure of}} a median graph, in which an edge corresponds to the operation of flipping the values of a set of variables that are all constrained to be equal or unequal <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> <b>In</b> particular, by following edges in this way one can get from any solution to any other solution. Conversely, any median graph can be represented as the set of {{solutions to}} a 2-satisfiability instance in this way. The median of any three solutions is formed by setting each variable to the value it holds in the majority of the three solutions. This median always forms another solution to the instance.|$|E

5|$|The upper incisors are orthodont (with their {{cutting edge}} {{perpendicular}} to the plane formed by the molars) and have yellow to light orange enamel. On the lower incisor, the enamel contains series of fine ridges. The toothrows are longer than in eastern voalavo. As in Eliurus, the molars are incipiently hypsodont (high-crowned) and the individual cusps have lost their identities, having merged into transverse laminae that are not connected longitudinally. There are three laminae on each first and second molar, two on the third lower molar, and the laminae cannot be differentiated on the third upper molar. Although {{the first and second}} molars are similar <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> size, the third (upper and lower) molars are conspicuously smaller. There are three roots below each upper and two below each lower molar.|$|E

5|$|World of Dance Tour (WOD) {{was founded}} in 2008 by Myron Marten and David Gonzales in Pomona, California. It differs from other {{competitions}} {{because there is no}} final championship.
