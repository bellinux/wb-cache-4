5|$|A {{series of}} {{derailments}} {{in the mid-1970s}} shattered Amtrak's confidence in the locomotive, and many railroads banned it from their tracks. Multiple investigations pointed to issues with the locomotive's trucks, {{the weight of the}} water and steam generators used for <b>train</b> <b>heating,</b> or the vibration of baggage cars behind the locomotive. In 1977 Amtrak decided to move on from the SDP40F in favor of the EMD F40PH, which was already in use on short-distance routes. Amtrak traded most of its fleet into EMD; the components were incorporated into new F40PHs. The remainder were traded to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF) for use in freight service. The Santa Fe rebuilt the locomotives and designated them SDF40-2. The Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway (BNSF), successor to the Santa Fe, retired them in 2002.|$|E

25|$|Diesel {{multiple}} units were serviced in another open ended shed {{next to the}} carriage cleaning tracks. This shed was subsequently used to repair the electric <b>train</b> <b>heating</b> and air conditioning on the new Mark 3 and Mark 4 coaching stock.|$|E
25|$|The {{rebuilding}} lengthened {{the entire}} train to 455 feet (139 m) and seven cars. The power car had 12ft (3.7 m) added {{to accommodate a}} larger, 1,200hp (890kW) V16 Winton diesel engine. The RPO/baggage car was lengthened by eight feet (2.4 m) to take a steam generator for <b>train</b> <b>heating,</b> and {{was followed by the}} addition of a diner/lounge car.|$|E
25|$|Three former Class 25 {{locomotives}} {{were converted}} {{for use as}} mobile generators to provide electric heating on trains where the hauling locomotive could not supply this. They were referred to as ETHEL units (Electric <b>Train</b> <b>Heating</b> Ex-Locomotives), and unofficially named Ethel 1, Ethel 2 and Ethel 3. They were painted in a blue/grey livery {{in an effort to}} match the coaching stock livery of the day, but this was not too successful. All three have since been scrapped.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the distribution of}} wind velocity and air temperature on Shinkansen platforms at Station 'A' using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). We focused on existence of the <b>trains,</b> <b>heat</b> generated by <b>trains</b> and station buildings in the factors of air temperature rise on platforms. Air temperature on platform VII was varied within 0. 5 degrees depending on {{the presence or absence}} of <b>trains.</b> When the <b>heat</b> generated by <b>trains</b> was considered, air temperature on Shinkansen platforms was 1 degree higher than that when <b>trains</b> generated no <b>heat.</b> And when the station building was located on the windward side of the platforms, air temperature on Platform X was 3 to 7 degrees higher than that when the station building was disappeared...|$|R
25|$|The {{fire started}} in a British Railways Mark 1 {{sleeping}} car (no. W2437) {{which was built}} in 1960, at which time trains in the UK were mostly hauled by steam locomotives, which provided steam for heating passenger accommodation. Diesel locomotives of the period were fitted with boilers {{so that they could}} be used with existing coaches. However, with steam locomotives gone by the 1970s, and with boilers proving unreliable and expensive to maintain, {{the decision was made to}} change to electric <b>train</b> <b>heating</b> (ETH). W2437 was converted in 1976, with an electric heater being installed in the vestibule.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} express-service refrigerator cars entered service around 1890, {{shortly after}} the first express train routes were established in North America. The cars did not come into general use until the early 20th century. Most units designed for express service are larger than their standard counterparts, and are typically constructed more {{along the lines of}} baggage cars than freight equipment. Cars must be equipped with speed-rated trucks and brakes, and— {{if they are to be}} run ahead of the passenger car, must also incorporate an air line for pneumatic braking, a communication signal air line, and a steam line for <b>train</b> <b>heating.</b> Express units were typically painted in passenger car colors, such as Pullman green.|$|E
25|$|By 1966 {{they began}} to be painted in {{corporate}} Rail Blue with yellow ends, the change generally coinciding with a works repair and the fitting of air brake equipment, the locomotives originally having only vacuum braking (the first so treated was D9002; the last to be painted blue was D9014). In the early 1970s they were fitted with Electric <b>Train</b> <b>Heating</b> (ETH) equipment to power {{the new generation of}} air-conditioned coaches, while a couple of years later, with the introduction of BR's TOPS computer system, they were renumbered 55 001 to 55 022. In 1979, Finsbury Park restored the white cab window surrounds to their remaining six Deltics, making them distinctive, although these were later painted over when the locomotives were transferred to York during the rundown of the depot at Finsbury Park.|$|E
40|$|Fouling in crude preheat <b>train</b> <b>heat</b> {{exchangers}} in refineries is {{a complex}} phenomenon. Crude oil fouling undergoes different mechanisms {{at different stages of}} preheating. Understanding the fouling mechanisms is essential in formulating appropriate fouling mitigation strategies. The use of the concept of threshold fouling conditions is one of the approaches for mitigating fouling through operating conditions. In this study, an attempt has been made to review the various fouling models available in literature, their advantages and limitations...|$|R
5000|$|At {{least in}} the case of the December 11, 1941 {{transport}} from Düsseldorf, the train was composed of third class passenger cars for the Jews and a second class passenger car for the guards. Apparently efforts were made to keep the <b>train</b> <b>heated.</b> [...] A rail car on another transport to Riga from Vienna was reported not to have been heated, which resulted in at least one person having frostbit feet, which later turned gangrenous and had to be amputated.|$|R
50|$|Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation of Hong Kong were {{an early}} customer, {{ordering}} five locomotives in 2001 for use hauling freight services on the Kowloon-Canton Railway.Nord-Ostsee-Bahn also operate ER20s as 'DE 2000'. These original locomotives {{were available in}} a passenger version; the equipment (such as electric <b>train</b> <b>heat</b> etc.) required for passenger operation was carried under the locomotives frame between the bogies and necessitated {{a reduction in the}} size of the fuel tank. Alternatively, it may be said that the freight version has a larger fuel tank.|$|R
25|$|Prejudice against {{hydraulic}} transmission {{in the higher}} echelons of BR's engineering divisions decreed in 1967 that all the WR's diesel-hydraulics were non-standard and should be withdrawn as soon as possible. Added to this were practical problems modernising the D800s: because of the scaled-down bodyshell {{there was very little}} room inside for extra equipment. It was, for example, physically impossible to accommodate a compressor as well as an exhauster, so the locomotives were unable to haul newer designs of air-braked coaching stock. It also proved impractical to equip them with electric <b>train</b> <b>heating</b> (ETH) equipment, for similar reasons, so they retained unreliable steam heat boilers to the end of their lives. It was intended to equip no. D870 with ETH; to provide the necessary additional power, the engines would have been uprated by the fitment of charge-air coolers. No work was actually carried out, other than the fitment of appropriate jumper cables on the locomotive ends.|$|E
25|$|Before the Main North Line was completed, {{the open}} {{sections}} were served by mixed trains and the Culverden Express. On 15 December 1945 {{the line was}} completed and the Picton Express began operating, providing a daily service between Picton and Christchurch. In January 1946 the express was cut to thrice weekly, and its popularity and profitability declined. In February 1956 it {{was replaced by a}} more frequent railcar service, using RM class 88-seaters. Falling patronage led to smaller Vulcan railcars being used from 1968 to 1975 with small trains, in summer, sometimes known as the Picton Express. In 1976 at the suggestion of Rangiora MP Derek Quigley, the old former first class cars previously used on the overnight Picton–Christchurch 'Cabbage Train' were transferred to the day express to provide <b>train</b> <b>heating,</b> and several other 56ft carriages were fitted with heaters to make an economical train. Progressively the old carriages were updated and a buffet carriage was eventually added to replace the Kaikoura pie and tea stop, at the last traditional NZR-style refreshment stop.|$|E
500|$|Originally TOPS {{numbered}} from 47301 to 47381, this sub-class {{was originally}} built with no <b>train</b> <b>heating</b> equipment and therefore remained as freight locomotives almost exclusively for their working lives. [...] They were all fitted with slow speed control for working MGR coal trains (as {{were a number}} of Class 47/0s). [...] However, during the summer months when train heat was not required, 47/3s could regularly be found hauling the extra trains that the holiday season brought. The sub-type remained stable until withdrawals started, although an [...] "extra" [...] 47/3, No.47300, was created in 1992 when No.47468 had its <b>train</b> <b>heating</b> equipment removed and was renumbered. This was a direct replacement for collision damaged 47343. Also, No.47364 was renumbered to 47981 in 1993 for use on RTC test trains.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{deliveries}} {{were for}} {{operation in the}} Crewe and Derby areas, but fifteen of the initial twenty were diverted for use on the Southern Region to cover for delays in the Kent Coast Electrification scheme. Here the heavy weight was not acceptable and the locos in question had to have their boilers removed before they were accepted. Later some locos had their boilers re-fitted and these examples could be found, often in tandem with a Class 33 to provide steam heating to the coaches, the 33s only having electric <b>train</b> <b>heat</b> (ETH).|$|R
50|$|The plant {{provided}} heat by way {{of underground}} pipes encased in concrete masonry. Originally, a spur of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad led to the building, which used coal transported by <b>train</b> for <b>heat</b> production.|$|R
50|$|The main {{difference}} between the HST vehicles and the loco-hauled Mark 3A relate to electrical supply arrangements. HST coaches take an industrial voltage/frequency 3-phase supply directly from an auxiliary alternator in the power car to supply on-board equipment such as air conditioning; loco-hauled vehicles take a standard single-phase 1000 V AC or DC <b>train</b> <b>heat</b> supply from the locomotive and convert it through motor generator units under the floor. These convert the train supply to 3-phase 415/240 V 50 Hz AC to power air conditioning and other ancillaries. The two types are non-interconnectable in service conditions. The other {{main difference}} {{is the lack of}} buffers on HST coaches.|$|R
500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the fleet was renumbered into the 47xxx series to conform with the {{computerised}} TOPS systems. [...] This enabled {{a number of}} easily recognisable sub-classes to be created, depending on the differing equipment fitted. [...] The original series were based on <b>train</b> <b>heating</b> capability and were as follows; ...|$|E
500|$|The locomotives, bar a {{batch of}} 81 built for freight duties, were all fitted with steam heating boilers for train heat duties. [...] The initial batch of twenty, plus D1960 and D1961, were also fitted with {{electric}} <b>train</b> <b>heating</b> (ETH). [...] With this type of heating becoming standard, a further large number of locomotives were later fitted with this equipment.|$|E
500|$|Originally TOPS {{numbered}} from 47001 to 47298, these locomotives {{were the}} [...] "basic" [...] Class 47 with steam heating equipment fitted. [...] In the 1970s and 1980s, with steam heating of trains gradually being phased out, all locomotives fitted {{with the equipment}} gradually had their steam heating boilers removed. [...] Some were fitted with ETH and became 47/4s, whilst the others remained with no <b>train</b> <b>heating</b> capability and were therefore used mainly on freight work. [...] In the 1990s, the class designation 47/2 was applied to some class 47/0s and class 47/3s after they were fitted with multiple working equipment. [...] The locomotives involved also had their vacuum braking systems removed or isolated, leaving them air braked only. This was mainly a paper exercise, however, and the locomotives were not renumbered; in this article they are included in Class 47/0.|$|E

50|$|In {{areas where}} there is a {{constant}} need for power unrelated to moving the vehicle, such as electric <b>train</b> <b>heat</b> or air conditioning, this load requirement can be utilized as a sink for the recovered energy via modern AC traction systems. This method has become popular with North American passenger railroads where head end power loads are typically in the area of 500 kW year round. Using HEP loads in this way has prompted recent electric locomotive designs such as the ALP-46 and ACS-64 to eliminate the use of dynamic brake resistor grids and also eliminates any need for any external power infrastructure to accommodate power recovery allowing self-powered vehicles to employ regenerative braking as well.|$|R
50|$|As of July 2016 {{at least}} one of {{locomotives}} was painted in corporate livery of CZ Loko, was overhauled for cargo service, this means that its speed was decreased to 120kmph and <b>train</b> electrical <b>heating</b> was removed. The locomotive was also fitted with electrodynamic brake without recuperation.|$|R
2500|$|In the mid-1950s, with {{declining demand}} for {{passenger}} train service, GG1s 4801–4857 were re-geared for a maximum speed of [...] {{and placed in}} freight service. They initially retained their <b>train</b> <b>heating</b> steam generator, and were recalled to passenger service for holiday season mail trains, and 'Passenger Extras' such as those run for the annual Army–Navy football game in Philadelphia.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1950, Westinghouse {{completed}} an experimental [...] turbine locomotive, #4000, {{known as the}} Blue Goose, with a B-B-B-B wheel arrangement. The locomotive used two [...] turbine engines, was equipped for passenger <b>train</b> <b>heating</b> with a steam generator that utilized the waste exhaust heat of the right hand turbine, and was geared for [...] While it was demonstrated successfully in both freight and passenger service on the PRR, MKT, and CNW, no production orders followed, and it was scrapped in 1953.|$|E
2500|$|Driving trailers, {{also known}} as [...] "control cars" [...] and {{numbered}} in the 61xx series, retained an operative cab and were marshalled {{at the end of}} the train remote from the locomotive. The cab retained most of the original (diesel-mechanical) railcar controls, which were modified to control the (diesel-electric) locomotive; for instance, the gear selector became the eight-notch power control. The guard's compartment contained a boiler for <b>train</b> <b>heating</b> and a diesel generator set to supply lights and boiler auxiliaries; because the generator blocked one of the compartment's doors, the guard normally travelled in the corresponding compartment of the connector car.|$|E
500|$|Many {{of these}} fast expresses {{included}} special coaches {{that could be}} detached as they passed through stations without stopping, a guard riding in the coach to uncouple it from the main train {{and bring it to}} a stop at the correct position. The first such [...] "slip coach" [...] was detached from the Flying Dutchman at [...] in 1869. The company's first sleeping cars were operated between Paddington and Plymouth in 1877. Then on 1 October 1892 its first corridor train ran from Paddington to Birkenhead, and the following year saw the first <b>trains</b> <b>heated</b> by steam that was passed through the train in a pipe from the locomotive. May 1896 saw the introduction of first-class restaurant cars and the service was extended to all classes in 1903. Sleeping cars for third-class passengers were available from 1928.|$|R
