People want to say Obama can't make these moves or he's not executing. That's because he ain't got those connections. Black people don't have {{the same level of}} connections as Jewish people...We ain't Jewish. We don't got family that got money like that." [...] In response to his comments, the Anti-Defamation League stated: [...] "There it goes again, the age-old canard that Jews are all-powerful and control the levers of power in government." [...] On December 21, 2013, West backed off of the original comment and told a Chicago radio station that [...] "I thought I was giving a compliment, but if anything it came off more ignorant. I don't know how being told you have money is an insult." ...|$|E

2500|$|At Salon.com, Stephanie Zacharek {{writes that}} Dark Willow is [...] "far {{from being a}} cut-out angry lesbian, is more fleshed out, and more terrifyingly alive, than she has ever been before. More than any other character, she has driven the {{momentum}} of the past few episodes; she very nearly drove it off a cliff." [...] Several writers state that Willow's transition into Dark Willow is inevitable, grounded in Willow's self-hatred that had been festering from the first season. Both Dark Willow and even Willow herself state that Willow's sacrifices for her friends and lack of assertiveness are her undoing. In [...] "Doppelgangland", Willow (posing as Vampire Willow) says [...] "It's pathetic. She lets everyone walk all over her and gets cranky at her friends for no reason." [...] In [...] "Two to Go", Dark Willow remarks [...] "Let me <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Willow. She's a loser. And she always has been. People picked on Willow... and now Willow's a junkie." [...] Vamp Willow served as an indicator of what Willow is capable of; immediately before she flays Warren in one violent magical flash, she uses the same line Vamp Willow used in the third season: [...] "Bored now." ...|$|E

5000|$|In June 2014 Bill Moyes, former Monitor {{executive}} chair, {{urged the}} NHS to reconsider “whether {{the model of}} foundation trusts is sensible”, arguing “If one-third of the hospital system is permanently not demonstrating good viability and good governance, is that <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> actually how the system should run as opposed to how we thought it should run?” ...|$|R

5000|$|Buckley {{describes}} the second track as a [...] "real advance," [...] and that [...] "It {{deals with a}} ballad in a totally personal, physical presentation... It {{has to be done}} slowly; it has to take five or six minutes; {{it has to be a}} movement. It has to hold you there and make you aware that someone is <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> himself in the dark." ...|$|R
5000|$|The film's French writer, Laurence Coriat, was {{previously}} a psychology student. Winterbottom {{said that the}} script began similar to Short Cuts and [...] "the connections between the stories were purely down to geography" [...] but was rewritten so that [...] "the story of one sister <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the other two."

40|$|Extract] I am honoured to {{have been}} asked to give the Arthur Wilson Oration for 2012. I am going to start by <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Dr Arthur Wilson himself and his life. Born in 1888 in Melbourne, gaining his MB BCh in 1911 and MD in 1913. He also won {{university}} blues in athletics and rugby. He worked as a resident in the new Melbourne Hospital and took a trip to China as a ship's surgeon. On his return, he joined staff at the Women's Hospital, where he began his lifelong interest in obstetrics...|$|R

5000|$|Since {{the release}} of Take Shelter, viewers have {{discussed}} {{the meaning of the}} film's ambiguous ending. In an interview with Creative Screenwriting five years after {{the release of}} the film, Nichols reflected, [...] "I had a very strict idea of what the end of Take Shelter was. I know exactly what happens, and it’s fascinating to see people respond to it in their own ways. The beautiful part of storytelling is that you’re not just telling people a story, they’re also <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> themselves too through their reactions. In that situation you’re in a conversation with your audience. I really can’t think of a more rewarding or fulfilling result for something you’ve written. It’s active, kinetic, and really humbling." ...|$|R
