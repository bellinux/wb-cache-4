5|$|The Federal Bridge Gross Weight Formula, {{also known}} as Bridge Formula B or the Federal Bridge Formula, is a {{mathematical}} formula in use in the United States by <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> and Department of Transportation (DOT) officials to determine the appropriate maximum gross weight for a commercial motor vehicle (CMV) based on axle number and spacing. The formula is part of federal weight and size regulations regarding interstate commercial traffic (intrastate traffic is subject to state limits). The formula is necessary to prevent heavy vehicles from damaging roads and bridges. CMVs are most often tractor-trailers or buses, but the formula is of most interest to <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> due to the heavy loads their vehicles often carry.|$|E
5|$|<b>Truck</b> <b>drivers</b> {{spend up to}} 11hours a day driving, and up to 14hours a day {{engaged in}} various duties (including driving time) such as fueling, filling out paperwork, obtaining vehicle repairs, and {{conducting}} mandatory vehicle inspections. Long-haul drivers often spend weeks away from home, spending their time off and sleeping at truck stops or rest areas. Driving is relatively dangerous work, as <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> account for 12 percent and the highest total number of all work-related deaths, and are five {{times more likely to}} die on the job than the average worker. Smoking, lack of exercise, unhealthy eating habits, and work-related injuries also contribute to the driver's generally risk-prone lifestyle. A survey by the National Institutes of Health found 67 percent of long-haul drivers were smokers or had quit smoking.|$|E

5|$|During the trip, Homer {{falls asleep}} and wakes up {{abruptly}} {{at the wheel}} of the truck due to taking a combination of pep pills and sleeping pills that he bought at a general store. He awakes to discover that the truck drove by itself with its Navitron Autodrive System. He informs other <b>truck</b> <b>drivers,</b> who inform him that he cannot let anyone know about the Autodrive system because it would make all <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> lose their jobs. However, Homer tells the passengers of a passing bus about the system, which causes an angry mob of truckers to go after Homer. But even after the Autodrive system ejects itself from Homer's semi, Homer is able to escape from the angry trucker mob. Homer and Bart arrive in Atlanta to finish Red's shipment on time, and then commandeer a train full of napalm so they can return to Springfield.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{released}} {{the results of}} a five-year-long study (the Highway Serial Killings Initiative) investigating the unsolved murders of prostitutes, hitchhikers, and stranded motorists. Over 500 female victims have been compiled in a database, most of whom were killed or discarded at truck stops, hotels, and roadsides. The FBI has speculated that many of these victims were murdered by long-haul <b>truck</b> <b>drivers,</b> some of whom may be serial killers. Investigators speculate that the easy access to potential victims, mobility, and lack of supervision enjoyed by long-haul <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> have contributed to this phenomenon. The head of the initiative, Michael Harrigan, says most of the victims lead high-risk lifestyles (e.g., prostitution) which left them particularly vulnerable. In 2004, the FBI began investigating a string of murders in which the victims were found along the Interstate 40 corridor in Oklahoma and several other states, which sparked the creation of the Highway Serial Killings Initiative.|$|E
5|$|Trucking {{achieved}} {{national attention}} during the 1960s and 70s, when songs and movies about truck driving were major hits. <b>Truck</b> <b>drivers</b> participated in widespread strikes against {{the rising cost}} of fuel, during the energy crises of 1973 and 1979.

5|$|A general {{hospital}} {{is located in}} {{the eastern side of the}} city. Modern health care facilities exist only in Bangui but are poor, providing only minimal care. Wealthier citizens make use of private clinics. The risk of catching HIV in the city is reportedly high, and many <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> stopping in the city for sexual services pose a major risk of spreading the disease to other parts of the country. The risk of catching malaria in Bangui and pygmy camps is also much higher than in the rest of the country.|$|E

5|$|Another $500,000 {{study was}} ordered in 2003 by the legislature, {{creating}} a new commerce corridor to link Lewis County {{in the south to}} the Canada–US border in the north. However the study showed that a highway existing north of I-90 was not economically feasible. The study proposed a toll road only for trucks, since the presence of passenger cars would discourage <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> from using the new alternate route. The highway was estimated to cost between $13.5 and $19 billion.|$|E
5|$|May 13, 1972: Near Bean Station, Tennessee, between Knoxville and Bristol, a Greyhound Scenicruiser on a {{scheduled}} trip from Memphis to New York City collided head-on with a tractor-trailer truck.

5|$|On {{the other}} side, the cement {{industry}} in Iran {{is one of}} the economic sectors that will be hit the hardest in Iran following of the subsidy reform plan, because many Iranian cement factories are energy inefficient (Notwithstanding possible adjustment and/or liberalization of commodities prices by the government during implementation). Taxi, delivery and <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> have also been adversely affected by the recent gas price increase. Experts believe that the removal of subsidies is likely to have an adverse impact on the profitability of the automotive sector {{for at least the next}} 2–3 years.|$|E

Shortly {{before the beginning of}} location shooting, Hollywood union <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> or teamsters went on strike to protest pay cuts and overtime changes. With deadlines looming, the production searched for non-union drivers, aware that the Teamsters might retaliate by sabotaging equipment or flying airplanes above the filming to ruin audio recordings. After one of the production's camera trucks exploded in the studio parking lot, the non-union drivers headed to Yosemite National Park under cover of darkness with a police escort.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> {{have used}} the pass despite the prohibition. They are {{generally}} either unaware of the restriction and following routes plotted by their GPS devices, or aware of it and willing to risk the fine {{for the sake of}} the time and distance saved. The resulting accidents have forced the closure of the pass. CDOT has put in larger signs advising drivers of the ban and worked with GPS device manufacturers so their software notes the restriction. Aspen officials have suggested the fines be increased as well.|$|E
5|$|The new {{alignment}} of US-6 was opened on December 30, 1983.

5|$|The {{slippery}} concrete surfacing, steep left-side ramps, center breakdown lane, and wide-open alignment {{built for}} high speeds all {{contributed to a}} high number of crashes. Mayor Frank Hague of Jersey City passed an ordinance in November 1933 banning trucks from its section of the skyway, which effectively banned them from the whole road.

5|$|Between 1962 and 2003, {{there were}} {{numerous}} proposals to change the HOS again, but none were ever finalized. By this time, the ICC had been abolished, and regulations were now issued by the FMCSA. The 2003 changes applied only to property-carrying drivers (i.e., <b>truck</b> <b>drivers).</b> These rules allowed 11hours of driving within a 14-hour period, and required 10hours of rest. These changes would allow drivers (using the entire 14-hour on-duty period) to maintain a natural 24-hour cycle, with a bare minimum 21-hour cycle (11hours driving, 10hours rest). However, the retention of the split sleeper berth provision would allow drivers to maintain irregular, short-burst sleeping schedules.|$|E
5|$|The {{automobile}} unions {{played a}} leading role in advancing the cause of women's rights. In 1955, the United Auto Workers Union (UAW) organized the UAW Women's Department to strengthen women's role in the union and encourage participation in the union's elected bodies. In a move that was met with some hostility by Teamsters leaders, the U.S. Division of Transport Personnel had in 1943 instructed Teamsters Union officials that women should be allowed full employment as <b>truck</b> <b>drivers.</b> That proved to be only a temporary wartime measure, but a change of heart among Teamsters leadership by the mid-1950s led to the Equal Pay Act of 1963. Women in the auto industry were considered leaders in the movement for women's rights.|$|E
