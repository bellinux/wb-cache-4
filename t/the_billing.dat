Stories of unexpected billing issues began to circulate in blogs and the technical press after the Apple iPhone's heavily advertised and anticipated release, but this video clip brought the voluminous bills to the attention of the mass media.|$|E

Nevertheless, he continued harassing Wilde, who eventually launched a private prosecution against the peer for criminal libel, triggering a series of trials ending in Wilde's imprisonment for gross indecency.

50|$|Each Bill {{consists}} of five main parts: the long title, the short title, the interpretation clause, {{the main body}} of <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> and <b>the</b> objects and reasons.

The short title sometimes also, contains the commencement clause, which states when <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> will have legal force. The short title in turn is followed by the interpretation clause, which defines certain words and phrases used in <b>the</b> <b>Bill.</b> <b>The</b> body of <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> {{consists of}} all of the other clauses, which contain the provisions of <b>the</b> <b>Bill,</b> that is, they contain all of the measures that <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> is enacting. <b>The</b> objects and reasons is the final part of a Bill and it seeks to explain in layman’s terms the purpose of <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> and <b>the</b> reason why it is necessary.|$|R

5|$|On 31 March 1731, The Author's Farce was {{paired with}} the Tom Thumb remake, The Tragedy of Tragedies, as a {{replacement}} for The Letter Writers, the original companion piece.

The last documented non-puppet version was performed on 28 March 1748 by Theophilus Cibber as a two-act companion piece for a benefit show. The Pleasures of the Town act was performed as a one-act play outside London throughout the century, including a 15-show run at Norwich in 1749 and during the 1750s, and a production at York during the 1751–52 theatre season. Additionally, there were benefit shows that included the third act at a variety of locations, including Dublin, on 19 December 1763 and Edinburgh in 1763.

25|$|Any {{adjustment}} of water tariffs requires Cabinet approval. In September 2009, King Abdullah stated that water tariffs {{would not be}} increased. In June 2010 the government announced the first tariff increase since 1997, emphasizing that low-volume consumers would not be affected because the tariff in the first block remained unchanged. The tariff increase, said to amount to only 9% for volumes beyond the first block, would become effective in January 2011. At the same time, <b>the</b> <b>billing</b> cycle was changed from every three months to monthly. Furthermore, tariffs in five governorates were silently substantially increased to {{the same level as}} in Amman. In February 2012 the Cabinet decided to return to the quarterly billing cycle and to further increase tariffs in the higher blocks of consumption.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>billing</b> cycle for unmetered {{customers}} is annual {{and most}} users, including many with water meters, {{are so far}} billed a flat rate only. Bills for metered customers whose meters are being read are sent out on a quarterly basis. The level of cost recovery is low. According to GWI's Turnaround Plan, the utility's average billing efficiency in the 2003-2006 period was only 68%, meaning that 32% of its customers did not pay their bills. In 2006 GWI collected revenues of only G$ 1.2billion, while {{operation and maintenance costs}} stood at G$ 3.5billion, including more than 60% paid for electricity, mainly for pumping. The difference was partly made up by a government subsidy of G$ 1.4billion, and partly resulted in unpaid bills to GWI's suppliers and deferred maintenance.|$|E
25|$|In 2003 the {{municipality}} of Tripoli signed {{the first and}} so far only management contract for water supply in Lebanon. This was done {{after four years of}} preparation that required passing a new law (Law 401) to allow public-private partnerships in water supply. The contract was awarded to the French company Ondéo‐Liban, a subsidiary of Suez Environnement, after a competitive bidding process. The cost of 20 million Euro was financed by the French Development Agency. The contract included the operation, maintenance, and installation of equipment, the organization of <b>the</b> <b>billing</b> system and collection of water tariffs, the management of human and financial resources, and the supervision of the construction of a tertiary water supply network and the expansion of a water treatment plant. The private company increased <b>the</b> <b>billing</b> efficiency from 30% to 60%, reduced water rationing, mapped the network, updated the customer inventory, computerized the accounting system and trained staff. Non-revenue water was reduced from 65% to 45% and the 10-year-long water rationing in the areas of Qalamoun, Qobbe and Abi Samra was eliminated, making Tripoli the only city in Lebanon that receives water 24 hours per day. Water quality and the customer service were also improved. However, cost recovery was not achieved despite an increase in tariffs because bill collection efficiency remained low. The company was unable to introduce metering, although 40,000 meters were acquired. The contract faced a number of challenges: According {{to a study by the}} French Institute for Public-Private Partnerships, the supervisory committee was composed of former employees of the public water company who were not convinced of the usefulness of private sector participation. Despite its achievements, the management contract ended in 2007 without being extended.|$|E
