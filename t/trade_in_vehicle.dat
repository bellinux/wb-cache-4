40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades an {{unprecedented}} increase <b>in</b> private <b>vehicle</b> ownership has taken place in the developing world. This growth is due, in part, to increased international <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> used <b>vehicles.</b> <b>In</b> this paper we use theory and empirical evidence to evaluate the environmental implications of free <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> <b>vehicles</b> and other used durable goods. With non‐homothetic preferences, used vehicles are relatively inexpensive in high‐income countries and free trade causes these goods to be exported to low‐income countries. We apply this framework to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Since trade restrictions were eliminated in 2005, over 2. 5 million used cars have been exported from the United States to Mexico. Using a unique, vehicle‐level dataset, we find that traded vehicles are dirtier than the stock of <b>vehicles</b> <b>in</b> the United States and cleaner than the stock <b>in</b> Mexico, so <b>trade</b> leads average vehicle emissions to decrease in both countries. Total greenhouse gas emissions increase, primarily because trade gives new life to vehicles that otherwise would have been scrapped.

40|$|This paper {{traces the}} decline of the Japanese auto industry, from the {{perspective}} of North America. Alongside a detailing of the "twin gaps" story of the ascent and waning of the industry in Japan, I sketch the corresponding fall and now rise of that in America. Indeed, the U. S. is currently the most desirable place in the world to build cars. As a result, {{for the first time since}} the 1920 s we are seeing a strategic focus on export markets by the U. S. industry. In parallel with this, exporters based in Japan and (more recently) Germany are focussing on local production. The consequences of this are far-reaching. The import share of the American market will continue its steady decline, while U. S. exports will rise rapidly; both Japan and Europe will become significant markets. Total Japanese exports will likewise diminish, though in the short run this will be partially offset by the rapidly growth of markets in Southeast Asia and Latin America, in which American firms have a weak base. For the 800, 000 + workers in the American industry, this will be good news. It will mean hard times in Japan, where the industry also employs 800, 000. Trade tensions will ease with Japan; they will increase with Europe. More generally, the diffusion of "lean" production will place pressure on all highcost producing regions [...] -similar changes are beginning within the EC [...] -while the rapid shift of comparative costs, relative to the useful life of physical and human capital in the industry, should raise flags for any firm or country that finds itself dependent upon export markets.

This constituted an integral element of an overall strategy aimed at stimulating manufacturing activity due to the extensive linkage effects that exist between these activities. However, in the long run, protectionism simultaneously led to an inefficient inward looking industry which could not compete against the relatively more efficient and hence export focused international passenger motor vehicle industry. This threatened not only the viability of motor <b>vehicle</b> production <b>in</b> Australia, but also other sectors of the economy, such as the components sector, that depended upon it.

40|$|Restricted until 14 Apr. 2012. My {{dissertation}} research examines {{implications of}} product trade-ins for consumer demand and retailer pricing behavior. Although product trade-ins are very prevalent in many durable goods markets, such as golf clubs, home appliances, and automobiles, {{there has been}} relatively little academic research examining this phenomenon. I examine how information provided by consumers' previous purchases can be leveraged to predict their future choices {{and its implications for}} retailer pricing decisions.; In the first chapter, I propose a spatial autoregressive multinomial probit model in which the preferences and marketing mix responsiveness of different consumers depend upon their relative proximity to each other. Unlike previous applications of spatial models in marketing that have focused on the impact of geographical proximity between consumers, I develop a contiguity metric which accounts for the similarity between consumer's previous purchases. I demonstrate that information about a consumer's previous purchase can be harnessed to predict the choices of other consumers for other products as well as simply to improve choice predictions of the same consumer for the same product, known in the marketing literature as structural state dependence.; I estimate the proposed model using transaction data for new car purchases in the midsize sedan market. The proposed model outperforms the commonly used random coefficient probit model as well as other spatial models that are based solely on the geographic closeness between consumers or that only incorporate preference or response correlation individually, but not together. I show the spatial correlations in one market may be used to yield more accurate predictions of consumer demand in other markets. I also show that ignoring spatial correlation based on previous vehicle similarity is found to underestimate the elasticity differences between brand-loyal consumers and switchers.; Building on this idea, in the second chapter, I investigate how the information provided by the trade-in decisions of a consumer impacts the new car pricing decisions of a retailer. First, I develop a theoretical model of the phenomenon, and use it to derive the optimal new car prices with and without trade-in information. Second, I test the predictions of my theoretical model by estimating a hedonic regression model of new car prices obtained from transaction data in the midsize sedan market. Finally, I develop and estimate a structural choice model and conduct a series of counterfactual analysis to quantify the benefit of trade-in information to the dealer.; The unique equilibrium solution of my theoretical model suggests that retailers charge a premium on new car when consumers <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> their used cars and that the premiums are even higher if the <b>traded</b> <b>in</b> <b>vehicle</b> is more similar to the new one. My empirical analysis supports my theory by showing that consumers who traded-in a used vehicle paid a higher price for the same new car than those who did not. Further, those consumers who <b>traded</b> <b>in</b> used cars that were of the same make and model of the new vehicle paid an even higher premium on their new car purchase. The structural model estimation results and counterfactual analysis show that price discrimination based on consumer trade-in information reduces market share but increases retailer profits because retailers end up leaving less money on the table. This demonstrates that the better information about consumer preferences provided by trade-ins substantially impacts dealer profits...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the potential impact}} of used vehicle trade liberalization on Mexico's new vehicle market with the full implementation of the NAFTA agreement. Although the legal environment has been unfavorable toward the importation of used vehicles into Mexico, used vehicles primarily from the U. S. have entered the market as gray or illegal goods. In recent years Mexico may have already become a dumping ground for U. S. used <b>vehicles.</b> Beginning <b>in</b> 2009, Mexico is set to progressively open the market for used vehicle imports according to NAFTA regulations, fully liberalizing it by 2019. To quantify {{the potential impact of}} legal used vehicle imports, this paper develops a new analytical model. Given the lack of historical data, the methodology combines econometric estimation with a comparative analysis using the Polish used vehicle case as foundation. Through various scenarios, our research suggests that the medium-to-long term impact on new vehicle sales could be severe. The auto industry could reach a low 0. 6 million units by the time the market is fully liberalized. And even under the most optimistic scenario, the industry only reaches 1. 3 million units by 2019, not much higher than the 1. 15 million units in 2007. While some academic literature indicates that there are social and economic benefits of free <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> used <b>vehicles,</b> at least <b>in</b> the case of a lower income market opening itself up to a much larger and higher income mature market, the net impact seems to be negative.
