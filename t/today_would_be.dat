25|$|On January 17, 2007, at its press tour sessions, NBC {{announced}} that <b>Today</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> expanded {{to four hours}} beginning that fall. In order {{to make room for}} the expansion, NBC – rather than take one hour of programming time allocated for syndicated or local programming away from its stations – made the decision to cancel the struggling daytime soap opera Passions.|$|E
25|$|In My Life and Work, Ford {{predicted}} that if greed, racism, and short-sightedness could be overcome, then economic and technological development {{throughout the world}} would progress {{to the point that}} international trade would no longer be based on (what <b>today</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> called) colonial or neocolonial models and would truly benefit all peoples.

25|$|William Temple, {{after he}} retired from being what <b>today</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> called Secretary of State, wrote several bucolic prose works in praise of retirement, contemplation, and direct {{observation}} of nature. He also brought the Ancients and Moderns quarrel into English with his Reflections on Ancient and Modern Learning. The debates that followed {{in the wake of}} this quarrel would inspire many of the major authors {{of the first half of}} the 18th century (most notably Swift and Alexander Pope).|$|E
25|$|It was {{impossible}} to foresee, {{in the spring of}} 1944, the present cult of the English country house. It seemed then that the ancestral seats which were our chief national artistic achievement were doomed to decay and spoilation like the monasteries in the sixteenth century. So I piled it on rather, with passionate sincerity. Brideshead <b>today</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> open to trippers, its treasures rearranged by expert hands and the fabric better maintained than it was by Lord Marchmain.|$|E
25|$|In 1914, Turner Valley {{became the}} first {{significant}} field found in Alberta. Eastern Canadian investors {{and the federal government}} showed little interest and the field was developed primarily by subsidiaries of U.S. companies. It was originally believed to be a gas field {{with a small amount of}} naptha condensed in the gas, but due to the lack of regulations, about 90% of the gas was flared off to extract the small amount of petroleum liquids, an amount of gas that <b>today</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> worth billions of dollars.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{settlement of}} Belfast {{was little more}} than a village, based around the marshy ford where the River Lagan met the River Farset, which <b>today</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> where High Street meets Victoria Street. The Ford of Belfast existed as early as 665, when a battle was fought at the site. The current Church of Ireland church at this location (St. George's) is built on the site of an ancient chapel used by pilgrims crossing the water. The earliest mention of the Chapel of the Ford is in the papal taxation rolls of 1306.|$|E
25|$|This was a {{difficult}} situation for Carlos I who now relied on the riches of Jakob Fugger to sway the election in his favor. Fugger transferred the enormous sum of more than 850.000 guilders to the Prince-electors which ultimately resulted in the unanimous election of Carlos I as Holy Roman Emperor on 28 July 1519. Out of this 850.000 guilders Fugger himself funded around 550.000 while another merchant house of Augsburg, the Welser family, contributed about 150.000 and three Italian bankers providing the rest. What <b>today</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> seen as bribery was common practice in {{the election of the}} Emperor. Exceptional however was the immense sums involved, mainly due to the keen competition among the princely candidates.|$|E
25|$|While the Hudson Tunnel Project {{would double}} the number of tracks under the Hudson River, it would not result in an {{increase}} in rail capacity due to constraints at Penn Station. Penn Station operates at capacity during peak periods, and since {{it takes a long time}} for passengers to board and alight trains, trains cannot leave and enter the station as might otherwise be possible. Even with improvements in the station, there are inadequate train storage facilities at Penn, and there is no capacity in the East River Tunnels to allow for trains to be stored during middays at Sunnyside Yard. Without these additional improvements, it is assumed that the same number of trains going between New Jersey and New York <b>today</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> operating in 2030, albeit with the additional tunnel capacity.|$|E

25|$|The {{parentage}} information, however, {{does not}} reveal how old the grape variety is, i.e., when the pollination of a Mondeuse blanche vine by Dureza took place, {{leading to the}} original Syrah seed plant. In the year AD 77, Pliny the Elder wrote in his Naturalis Historia about the wines of Vienne (which <b>today</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> called Côte-Rôtie), where the Allobroges made famous and prized wine from a dark-skinned grape variety that had not existed some 50 years earlier, in Virgil's age. Pliny called the vines of this wine Allobrogica, {{and it has been}} speculated that it could be today's Syrah. However, the description of the wine would also fit, for example, Dureza, and Pliny's observation that vines of Allobrogica were resistant to cold is not entirely consistent with Syrah.|$|E
500|$|... 1932: MacDonald Critchley and Charles J.C. Earl studied 29 {{patients}} with TSC {{who were in}} mental institutions. They described behaviour—unusual hand movements, bizarre attitudes and repetitive movements (stereotypies)—that <b>today</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> recognised as autistic. However it would be 11 years before Leo Kanner suggested the term [...] "autism". They also noticed the associated white spots on the skin (hypomelanic macules).|$|E

But in 1932, Congress passed a law outlawing this practice, known as the Brinkley Act. [...] Unfazed, Brinkley began using some of the first [...] "electrical transcriptions"—what <b>today</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> called pre-recordings—to circumvent the law. Around this time, Brinkley decided to sever the rest of his ties to Kansas, closing down his hospital there and opening a new one in Del Rio, which took up three floors of the Roswell Hotel, where he lived with his wife.|$|E

Prabir invites Pakrashi to meet a man named Rabindranath, and Pakrashi is {{surprised}} that [...] "Swapan" [...] is Prabir's servant Kaanai. Prabir admits {{that he was the}} mastermind behind the murders, with Kaanai (an ex-convict) carrying them out. He wanted to avenge the police force for his suspension, which he considered an insult to his hard work despite the loss of his family. After saying that <b>today's</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the final killing, he shoots himself.|$|R

500|$|Manchester City {{were formed}} in 1880 as West Gorton (St. Marks). At this time {{organised}} League football did not exist; ordinary matches (what <b>today</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> called friendly games) were arranged on a largely ad hoc basis and supplemented by the competitive games that cup competition required. [...] No complete {{record of the}} club's matches prior to 1891 survives. In 1890, the club entered the FA Cup for the first time, but withdrew in the second qualifying round. The following season they joined the Football Alliance, and in 1892 were elected to the newly formed Football League Second Division. In 1894 the club restructured, changing its name to Manchester City in the process.|$|E
500|$|An on- and {{off-road}} {{version of}} the Super Cub, what <b>today</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> classed as a dual-sport motorcycle but called a trail bike at the time, the CA100T Trail 50, came out in 1961. Jack McCormack, the first national sales manager of American Honda Motor Company, said the Trail 50, {{and even more so}} the later Honda CB77, was the result of Honda's willingness to listen to and respond customer demand. [...] "When you talk about Japanese manufacturers, their strength (besides the quality of their equipment) was that they listened to the marketplace. People always suggest that it was about Japanese management, but, to be frank, I was never impressed with Japanese management. They did what no other motorcycle make did—they listened." ...|$|E
500|$|The Histoire Naturelle, générale et particulière, avec la {{description}} du Cabinet du Roi is {{the work}} that the Comte de Buffon (1707–1788) is remembered for. He worked on it for some 50 years, initially at Montbard {{in his office in}} the Tour Saint-Louis, then in his library at Petit Fontenet. 36 volumes came out between 1749 and 1789, followed by 8 more after his death, thanks to Bernard Germain de Lacépède. It includes all the knowledge available in his time on the [...] "natural sciences", a broad term that includes disciplines which <b>today</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> called material science, physics, chemistry and technology. Buffon notes the morphological similarities between men and apes, although he considered apes completely devoid of the ability to think, differentiating them sharply from human beings. Buffon's attention to internal anatomy made him an early comparative anatomist. [...] "L’intérieur, dans les êtres vivants, est le fond du dessin de la nature", he wrote in his Quadrupèdes, [...] "the interior, in living things, is the foundation of nature's design." ...|$|E

500|$|Following the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention of 1787, a {{fatigued}} Washington {{returned to}} his estate, Mount Vernon. He seemed intent on resuming his retirement and letting others govern the nation with its new frame of government. The American public at large, however, wanted no one but Washington to be the nation's first president. The first U.S. presidential campaign was in essence what <b>today</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> called a grassroots effort to convince Washington to accept the office. Letters poured into Mount Vernon informing him of public sentiment and imploring him to accept; [...] from former comrades in arms, and from across the Atlantic. Gouverneur Morris urged Washington to accept, writing [...] " [...] thirteen horses now about to be coupled together, {{there are some of}} every race and character. They will listen to your voice and submit to your control. You therefore must, I say must mount this seat." [...] Alexander Hamilton {{was one of the most}} dedicated in his efforts to get Washington to accept the presidency, as he foresaw himself receiving a powerful position in the administration. The comte de Rochambeau urged Washington to accept, as did the Marquis de Lafayette, who exhorted Washington to [...] "not to deny your acceptance of the office of President for the first years." [...] Washington replied [...] "Let those follow the pursuits of ambition and fame, who have a keener relish for them, or who may have more years, in store, for the enjoyment." [...] In an August 1788 letter, Washington further expounded on his feelings regarding the election, stating, ...|$|E

[...] Curll was a {{bookseller}} (what <b>today</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> called a publisher), and he paid authors to produce biographies, translations, and the like. Similarly, Gildon, who was an occasional friend of Restoration authors, produced biographies with wholesale inventions in them. This writing for pay was despised by the literary authors, who called it [...] "hack" [...] writing.|$|E
