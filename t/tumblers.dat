5|$|With {{the design}} process complete, four street-ready race cars were constructed, with each vehicle {{possessing}} 65 panels and costing $250,000 to build. Two of the four cars were specialized versions. One version was the flap version, which had hydraulics and flaps to detail the close-up shots where the vehicle propelled itself through the air. The other version was the jet version, in which an actual jet engine was mounted onto the vehicle, fueled by six propane tanks. The visibility inside the vehicle was poor, so monitors were connected to cameras on the vehicle body. The professional drivers for the <b>Tumblers</b> practiced driving the vehicles for six months before they drove {{on the streets of}} Chicago for the film's scenes.|$|E
5|$|Mechanical cup-bearers and wine-pourers on automatic-traveling boats: The {{mechanical}} engineer Huang Gun served {{the court of}} Emperor Yang Di (r. 604–617) and wrote the book Shuishi Tujing on his inventions, which his colleague Du Bao enlarged and commented on. He constructed seven small boats, called 'wine boats', that were as large as 3m (10ft) long and 1.8m (6ft) wide which supported a number of mechanical figures of wooden statues called 'hydraulic elegances', each about 0.6m (2ft) tall, some of them animals but most in human form consisting of singing girls, musicians playing actual instruments, dancers and <b>tumblers,</b> oarsmen busy rowing, cup-bearers, and wine-pourers all moving simultaneously as if alive. These boats were set to travel at timed intervals along circuits made of winding stone channels and canals in palace courtyards and gardens (designed by Tang Haogui), where guests would gather for special occasions. The cup-bearer stood at the bow of each ship and beside him the wine-pourer; when the ship made automatically timed periodic stops where guests were seated, the cup-bearer automatically stretched out his arm with a full cup of wine. When the guest was done emptying his cup, he placed the cup back into the figure's hands; the latter then waited as the wine-pourer filled a second cup to be emptied. When this guest had been served, the wine boat automatically moved onwards to the next stop. The British sinologist, scientist, and historian Joseph Needham speculates that the 'wine boats' may have been paddle-wheel-driven. Another paddle wheel ship was commanded by Wang Zhen'e and described in his biographies dated from the Liu Song Dynasty (420–479). side from the partial remains of the Shuishi Tujing, an account of these 'wine boats' was also preserved by Huang Gun's contemporary Yan Shigu (581–645).|$|E

A multi-faceted {{introduction}} {{on current}} state and development trends of <b>tumbler</b> screening technology was proposed, which included that {{the origin and}} development of the <b>tumbler</b> screening machines, a comparison between <b>tumbler</b> screening machines and rotary vibration screens, the structure design and analysis, especially the screen mesh cleaning technology and specific machine applications. The status and development trends of <b>tumbler</b> screening machines in China and abroad especially in German were analyzed. The developing direction of future <b>tumbler</b> screening machines and the situation of Chinese businesses producing <b>tumbler</b> screening machines development were introduced. The Origin and Development <b>Tumbler</b> screening is a special form of screening machine among many other structures, and it is named after the rocking motion of its circular screen. <b>Tumbler</b> screening machines adopt mechanical eccentricity and offset angle forced driving mode. The entire cylindrical screen box makes rocking motion driven by the rocking shaft, and thus the machine belongs to mechanical rocking motion screens. The basic structure of the <b>tumbler</b> screening machines is developed in 1999 [1], the German inventor G. Kainz was granted the patent in Europe. Then, several technica...|$|R

25|$|There are {{two main}} types of rock tumbling: barrel (rotary) tumbling, and {{vibratory}} tumbling. Rotary tumbling is more common, simpler, quieter and less expensive than vibratory <b>tumblers.</b> There are two differentiating factors, however, that may lead one to use a vibratory tumbler. First, vibratory tumbler retain the overall shape of the rough rock, whereas rotary <b>tumblers</b> tend to make rocks round. Thus, {{it is important to}} use vibratory tumbler to make faceted shapes and tear drop forms. Second, vibratory <b>tumblers</b> tend to process much faster than rotary <b>tumblers,</b> generally reducing the process time to half.|$|E

25|$|These techniques, {{although}} {{they take a}} long time, involve very little operator intervention and thus are very cheap. Small <b>tumblers</b> (one pound capacity) are available and inexpensive for home/hobbyist use. At {{the other end of}} the scale, professionals can use very large barrels to do a lot of work at once. The main disadvantage of tumbling is its limited scope - stones will be smooth and have semi-random shapes (like pebbles from the beach), and metals need to be relatively simple shapes, with no fine work.|$|E

25|$|The {{pin tumbler}} lock is a lock {{mechanism}} that uses pins of varying lengths to prevent the lock from opening without the correct key. Pin <b>tumblers</b> are most commonly employed in cylinder locks, but may {{also be found in}} tubular or radial locks. The earliest pin-tumble locks were made over 4,000 years ago by the Egyptians. But due to their large, cumbersome size and since they were made of wood, the locks were not practical to use. In 1848, Linus Yale, Sr. invented the modern pin-tumbler lock. In 1861, Linus Yale, Jr. was inspired by the original 1840s cylindrical lock designed by his father, thus inventing and patenting a smaller flat key with serrated edges as well as pins of varying lengths within the lock itself, the same design of the pin-tumbler lock which still remains in use today.|$|E
