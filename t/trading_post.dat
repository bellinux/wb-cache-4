Barnette became the city's first mayor, and the city flourished as thousands of people came in search of gold during the Fairbanks Gold Rush.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} phase, European control in Southeast Asia was largely {{confined}} {{to the establishment of}} <b>trading</b> <b>posts.</b> These <b>trading</b> <b>posts</b> were used to store the oriental products obtained from the local traders before they were exported to the European markets.

The city was offered to France's envoy to Siam, the Chevalier de Chaumont, and a provisional treaty signed in December; Siamese ambassador Kosa Pan sailed to France the following year to ratify the cession.

5|$|In 1901, trader Ebenezer Barnette sailed up Alaska's Tanana River {{in hopes}} of {{establishing}} a <b>trading</b> <b>post</b> on the trail connecting the coastal town of Valdez with the gold-mining community of Eagle. Due to low water, however, the steamboat Barnette chartered was unable to continue up the river. Discouraged, Barnette deposited his cache of goods on a riverbank of the Chena River and sailed downstream {{with the intent of}} making another attempt to sail up the river during the following year. In 1902, miner Felix Pedro struck gold at a spot about 15 miles north of the spot where Barnette left his supplies. Seeing an opportunity, Barnette decided to establish a <b>trading</b> <b>post</b> at the spot. Other miners and suppliers arrived, attracted by the gold, and Barnette named the settlement Fairbanks, after Indiana Senator and later Vice President of the United States Charles W. Fairbanks.|$|E

5|$|The fort is {{the second}} largest Danish fort after Kronborg, the {{inspiration}} for Shakespeare's Hamlet. It was built by Ove Gjedde {{with the help of}} local laborers in Danish style. The lower compartment in the basement adjoining the fort was used as a store room, prison and a rest room for the soldiers, while the governor and priests resided in the second level. Fort Dansborg was the base for Danish settlement in the region during the early 17th century. Originally a fishing village, Tharangambadi (referred as Tranquebar) was fortified by the Danish, who used the port as the main <b>trading</b> <b>post</b> for the colony, with the major export of the colony being cotton textiles. During the middle of the 18th century, the commercial importance of the town declined and the centre of textile production moved to Serampore in the state of Bengal. But Tranquebar still remained the headquarters of the Colony. The fort and the town was sold to the British in 1845 and, along with Tharangambadi, the fort lost its significance as the town was not a <b>trading</b> <b>post</b> anymore.|$|E

The area had seen human occupation since at least the last ice age, but a permanent settlement was not established at the site of Fairbanks until the 20th century.|$|E

40|$|The late Arthur Silver Morton {{has contributed}} immensely to our {{understanding}} and preservation of western Canadian history. One of Morton’s joys was locating remains of long forgotten fur <b>trade</b> <b>posts.</b> As a result, {{a large number of}} the Saskatchewan fur <b>trade</b> <b>posts</b> that we know of were located and recorded by Morton. The majority of Morton’s investigations took place throughout the 1930 s and 1940 s. Morton consulted whatever historic sources were available to him at the time: numerous historic documents, ethnographic accounts and local histories. There has been archaeological evidence that suggests Morton misidentified numerous fur <b>trade</b> <b>post</b> sites. For example, research at the Hudson’s Bay Company’s South Branch House (1786 - 1794), which Morton identified in 1944, has sparked some controversy {{as to whether or not}} it is that particular post. As a result, this provides the author with an excellent chance to examine how Morton identified Saskatchewan fur <b>trade</b> <b>posts</b> and to determine through archaeological excavations and historical documents the accuracy of Morton’s historical site designation at South Branch House. A critical approach to Morton’s work will determine how accurate his work is for contemporary archaeological investigations of fur <b>trade</b> <b>posts.</b> Furthermore, this thesis may provide historical archaeologists with insights as to how to go about identifying fur <b>trade</b> <b>posts,</b> which will contribute to our overall understanding of the western Canadian fur trade...|$|R

The post property, now {{being used as a}} roadhouse, soon became known as McCarty's. Another prospector named Alonzo Maxey, and a friend, built Bradley's Roadhouse to compete with McCarty's and by 1907, McCarty's had been transferred to Maxey.|$|E

5|$|By 1717, French colonists had {{established}} the fort and a <b>trading</b> <b>post</b> at Natchez, Mississippi. They also granted numerous concessions for large plantations, {{as well as}} smaller farms, on land acquired from the Natchez. Relations between Natchez and colonists were generally friendly—some Frenchmen even married and had children with Natchez women—but there were tensions. There were reports of colonists abusing Natchez, forcing them to provide labor or goods, and as more colonists arrived, their concessions gradually encroached on Natchez lands.|$|E
