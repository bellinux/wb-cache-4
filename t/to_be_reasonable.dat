500|$|The port's visuals {{received}} {{a positive response}} from reviewers. AllGame's Mark Hoogland praised the improved car details, environment textures, and weather effects; GameSpot's Greg Kasavin echoed similar remarks, noting occasional frame rate drops. GameSpy's Sal Accardo commended the draw distance improvements, identifying very few texture issues. IGN's Steve Butts found the port's system requirements <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reasonable,</b> unlike Grand Theft Auto III, and praised the faster load times. Eurogamer's Martin Taylor was critical of the visuals, stating that the higher resolutions [...] "aren't kind to the overall visual quality", and criticising the hardware requirements.|$|E
500|$|A {{person who}} {{requires}} {{a certificate of}} suitability for admission to an institution of higher education must apply to the Director of Education, who must not issue a certificate if [...] "there appear to him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reasonable</b> grounds for believing that the applicant, if admitted to the institution in question, {{would be likely to}} promote, or otherwise participate in, action prejudicial to the interests or security of Singapore or any part thereof". A person who does not hold a certificate of suitability may not be admitted to an institution of higher learning as a student. A person who has been refused a certificate may appeal to the Home Affairs Minister, whose decision on the matter is final and cannot be called into question in any court.|$|E

To illustrate the point, he unveiled a mock motto for the rally: [...] "Take it down a notch for America." [...] A series of protest sign designs were proposed on the Daily Show featuring messages such as [...] "I disagree with you, but I'm pretty sure you're not Hitler." [...] Colbert responded to Stewart's proposal by challenging the theme of Stewart's rally and justifying his own [...] "March to Keep Fear Alive." [...] Noting that this was not the time <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reasonable,</b> Colbert declared, [...] "Now is the time for all good men to freak out for freedom!" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{time and}} {{duration}} of the activity is also taken into account when determining unreasonableness. Activities may be reasonable at one time but not at another; in Halsey v Esso Petroleum, filling oil tankers at 10am was held <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reasonable,</b> but the same activity undertaken at 10pm was unreasonable. A private nuisance is normally a [...] "continuing state of affairs", not a one-off situation; there are exceptions, such as in De Keyser's Royal Hotel v Spicer, where piledriving at night was considered a nuisance. In such situations, the normal remedy is to grant an injunction limiting {{the time of the}} activity. Another exception was found in British Celanese v AH Hunt Ltd, where an electronics company stored foil strips on their property which blew onto adjoining land, causing the power supply to a nearby yarn manufacturers to be cut off. A similar incident had occurred 3 years earlier and the defendants had been warned to store their strips properly; it was held that even though the power cut was a one-off event, the method of storing the foil strips constituted a continuing state of affairs, and the defendants were liable.|$|E
500|$|The Lithuanian government—given {{less than}} 12 hours to respond—debated the {{ultimatum}} {{during the night}} session. It was clear {{that no matter how}} the government responded, the Soviet army would invade Lithuania. President Antanas Smetona agreed only with the demand to form a new government argued for military resistance, even if it were symbolic. Merkys and his deputy Kazys Bizauskas urged acceptance. Soviet troops were stationed in Lithuania since October 1939 and acted honorably – the Soviets would surely continue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reasonable.</b> Bizauskas, a member of the opposition, saw the ultimatum as an opportunity {{to get rid of the}} Smetona regime. Historians cited his attitudes to illustrate his incomprehension of the dire situation. Raštikis, as the potential head of a new government, was invited to the meeting. Both former and current Chief Military Commanders Raštikis and Vincas Vitkauskas reported that mounting an effective armed resistance, when Soviet troops were already in the country and the Lithuanian military was not mobilized, was impossible. The government also rejected a diplomatic protest. [...] In Raštikis' view, such actions were empty and would do no more than anger the Russians and Urbšys, calling from Moscow, urged not to needlessly antagonize the Russians. Merkys and his cabinet resigned to make way for a new government led by Raštikis. The session ended at 7 am with a decision to accept all Russian demands without expressing protest or complaint.|$|E

2500|$|The Commission also found, however, {{that the}} cartoon was exempt under s18d of the Act, {{because it was}} done {{reasonably}} and in good faith. [...] The reasoning was based partly on the overall coverage of the issue by The West Australian, which [...] "provided a balance report... and an opinion which... encouraged unity in, and support of, the Aboriginal community". [...] In such a context, the decision by then editor Paul Murray to publish the cartoon was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reasonable.</b>|$|E
2500|$|There is no {{statutory}} {{definition of the}} term [...] "seizure" [...] in the Search and Surveillance Act 2012. In the Supreme Court Blanchard J defined seizure as simply the removing of something from the possession of someone else. Seizure can involve the taking into custody of personal property including vehicles and clothing. It can also relate to detaining individuals to search or obtain evidence from them. Any seizure must be for a legitimate law enforcement purpose <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reasonable,</b> this will generally mean the seizure must be authorised by an empowering statute. Most cases in New Zealand under s21 have focused on unreasonable searches rather than seizures.|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} {{difference between the}} basis of Professor Janda's conclusions and the concerns of industry is the presumption of how easy, or not, {{it will be for}} the Minister receiving a complaint to determine if it is [...] "frivolous or vexatious". [...] Professor Janda states that [...] "the general requirement that a complaint appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reasonable</b> on its face is nevertheless sufficiently stringent to allow the Minister in question efficiently to screen out complaints that are frivolous and vexatious", whereas industry representatives state that this will not be an easy determination, given that the complaints will likely relate to activities in remote areas and particularly if the complaint comes from an individual outside of Canada (in a developing country).|$|E

2500|$|Because {{the loss}} of {{swerving}} is so trivial compared to the crash that occurs if nobody swerves, the reasonable strategy {{would seem to be}} to swerve before a crash is likely. Yet, knowing this, if one believes one's opponent <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reasonable,</b> one may well decide not to swerve at all, in the belief that he will be reasonable and decide to swerve, leaving the other player the winner. This unstable situation can be formalized by saying {{there is more than one}} Nash equilibrium, which is a pair of strategies for which neither player gains by changing his own strategy while the other stays the same. (In this case, the pure strategy equilibria are the two situations wherein one player swerves while the other does not.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Speed {{reduction}} {{has traditionally}} been attempted {{by the introduction of}} statutory speed limits. [...] Traffic speeds of 30km/h (20mph) and lower are said to be more desirable on urban roads with mixed traffic. [...] The Austrian city of Graz, which has achieved steady growth in cycling, has applied 30km/h limits to 75% its streets since 1994. [...] Zones where speeds are set at 30 km/h (or 20mph) are gaining popularity [...] as they are found to be effective at reducing crashes and increasing community cohesion. Speed limits which are set below the speed that most motorists perceive <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reasonable</b> for the given road require additional measures to improve compliance. [...] Attempts to improve speed limit observance are usually by either education, enforcement or road engineering. [...] "Education" [...] can mean publicity campaigns or targeted road user training.|$|E
2500|$|General use {{by public}} {{officials}} can cover matters including public education, public {{radio and television}} broadcasting, the provision of services to the public, and so on. It is often accepted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reasonable</b> and justified for public officials to use the language of minorities, to an appropriate degree and level in their activities, when the numbers and geographic concentration of the speakers of a minority language are substantial enough. However, this is a contentious topic as the decision of substantiation is often arbitrary. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 26, does promise to protect all individuals from discrimination {{on the grounds of}} language. Following that, Article 27 declares, [...] "minorities shall not be denied the right… to use their own language". The Convention against Discrimination in Education, Article 5, also does declares the rights for minorities to [...] "use or teach their own language".|$|E

2500|$|By late August Wakefield {{realised}} Spain's {{findings were}} likely to be unfavourable to the company and wrote to the commissioner and offered to make cash payments to Maori who had missed out on payments in 1839. Spain had already {{come to the conclusion that}} Maori at Te Aro, Kumutoto, Pipitea and Kaiwharawhara pā had had no intention of selling their pā, cultivations and burial grounds and would not now move, and that reserves allotted them by the company, mainly on hilly ground, were unsuitable. Spain considered the offer of a further cash payment <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reasonable,</b> explaining that [...] "the natives who denied the sale seemed to be more anxious to obtain payment for their land than to dispossess the settlers then in occupation of it". He thought giving land back to the Maori was impractical because Wellington's population had grown to about 3000, outnumbering Maori by at least five to one.|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{then turned}} to {{consider}} whether the violation of freedom of religion could be upheld under section 1 of the Charter. [...] Following R. v. Oakes (1986), the Court asked {{whether there was a}} sufficient objective for the violation. [...] The main concern, as noted by the Quebec Court of Appeal, was school safety, which helps to maintain an atmosphere in which students can learn. [...] The Supreme Court agreed that would qualify as an important objective under section 1. [...] However, they then noted there were varying degrees of safety, with the highest degree of safety being excessive. [...] The Court contemplated the highest degree of safety would require the banning of scissors and other such objects. [...] Thus, safety in school is usually only supposed to be [...] "reasonable." [...] However, because the council wanted to rid the schools of weapons, the Court deemed the council's objective <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reasonable.</b> [...] This raised the question as to whether the rights infringement was rational and proportionate to the objective. [...] The banning of the kirpan was considered rational because it was a weapon, and thus the banning fit the objective of ridding the school of weapons.|$|E
2500|$|Under President Irwin in 1977, {{plans were}} made to {{relocate}} the college to a [...] parcel of land in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, by purchasing the faltering Charles E. Ellis School for Girls. The proposed move was unpopular among students {{and members of the}} Quincy community, even Governor Michael Dukakis urged to administration to reconsider, but the relocation never took place because the college was outbid for the land by a corporation that wanted to establish an industrial park there. In 1981, graduate degree offerings were expanded, and an accelerated program for working adults was started in 1990. In 1991, a report issued by the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in Massachusetts (AICUM) determined that the college contributed nearly $10 million to the local economy and brought in an estimated $7 million from outside the state. In 1992, President Kent Hill approved a policy to only hire Christian professors at the college, a move that stirred controversy in the media but was meant for the hiring of new faculty rather than the dismissal of then-current faculty, and was deemed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reasonable</b> according to civil rights laws. A second history of the college, spanning from 1950 to 2000, was started in 1993.|$|E
