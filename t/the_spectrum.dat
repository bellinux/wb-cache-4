5|$|White dwarfs {{whose primary}} {{spectral}} classification is DA have hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. They {{make up the}} majority (approximately 80%) of all observed white dwarfs.

Those classified as DB, DC, DO, DZ, and cool DQ have helium-dominated atmospheres. Assuming that carbon and metals are not present, which spectral classification is seen depends on the effective temperature.

5|$|A unique {{feature of}} the Homunculus {{is the ability to}} measure <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> of the central object at {{different}} latitudes by the reflected spectrum from different portions of the lobes.

By implication the outer envelope of Eta Carinae A is not strongly convective as that would prevent the gravity darkening. The current axis of rotation of the star does not appear to exactly match the alignment of the Homunculus. This may be due to interaction with Eta Carinae B which also modifies the observed stellar winds.|$|E

[...] For years {{there had been a}} so-called [...] "conundrum" [...] in the planetary science community because, in general, <b>the</b> <b>spectra</b> of asteroids do not match <b>the</b> <b>spectra</b> of our collection of meteorites. Particularly, <b>the</b> <b>spectra</b> of S-type asteroids, did not match <b>the</b> <b>spectra</b> of <b>the</b> most abundant type of meteorites, ordinary chondrites (OCs). <b>The</b> asteroid <b>spectra</b> tended to be redder with a steep curvature in the visible wavelengths. However, Binzel et al. have identified near Earth asteroids with spectral properties covering the range from S-type to spectra similar to those of OC meteorites, suggesting an ongoing process is occurring that can alter <b>the</b> <b>spectra</b> of OC material to look like S-type asteroids. There is also evidence of regolith alteration from Galileo's flybys of Gaspra and Ida showing spectral differences at fresh craters. With time, <b>the</b> <b>spectra</b> of Ida and Gaspra appear to redden and lose spectral contrast. Evidence from NEAR Shoemaker's x-ray measurements of Eros indicate an ordinary chondrite composition despite a red-sloped, S-type spectrum, again suggesting that some process has altered the optical properties of the surface.|$|R

Chlorophyll absorbs the long wavelengths of light (red) and short wavelengths of light (blue) much more efficiently than the wavelengths that appear green to the human eye, so light reflected by plants is enriched in green. Chlorophyll absorbs green light poorly because it first arose in organisms living in oceans where purple halobacteria were already exploiting photosynthesis.
