5|$|Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of {{rock music}} {{that began in}} the mid-1960s, with the garage, {{psychedelic}} and blues rock movements. It is <b>typified</b> <b>by</b> a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with keyboards.|$|E

50|$|The {{memorial}} {{was erected}} {{by the former}} Boston Borough Council in 1957, on the 350th anniversary of the event. The work {{was carried out by}} Leakes Masonry. The ceremony was attended by several members of the General Society of Mayflower Descendants, who made a donation towards the cost of the monument. Its design is a tapering shaft rising from a base-block, intended to symbolise the urge which drove a small band of men and women to leave their country and kinsfolk for consciences sake. The material used <b>typifies</b> <b>by</b> its strength the power and stability of their faith.|$|R

5|$|Balabushka {{cues from}} the Gus Szamboti era are <b>typified</b> <b>by</b> {{straight}} grained maple forearms bearing four ebony points, with four veneers included, normally colored black, green, white and mahogany, or sometimes with an orange veneer {{in place of}} mahogany. Balabushka cues from this era, spanning {{the last five years}} of his life, are considered the finest of his career as a class. There have been unconfirmed rumors that some few cues made during this period included splices made by Balabushka himself.|$|E
5|$|Closely {{related to}} power metal is {{progressive}} metal, which adopts the complex compositional approach of bands like Rush and King Crimson. This style {{emerged in the}} United States in the early and mid-1980s, with innovators such as Queensrÿche, Fates Warning, and Dream Theater. The mix of the progressive and power metal sounds is <b>typified</b> <b>by</b> New Jersey's Symphony X, whose guitarist Michael Romeo {{is among the most}} recognized of latter-day shredders.|$|E
5|$|In {{the romantic}} period, <b>typified</b> <b>by</b> Sylves (1927) and Volumes (1928), Rabearivelo's poems are shorter and reflect a purer form of {{traditional}} models. He identified {{himself and his}} work as post-symbolist {{in the early part}} of his artistic career. Regarding Rabearivelo's works from this period, editor Jacques Rabemananjara acknowledged the poet's evident talent but critiqued his over-adherence to form and poetic conventions at the expense of innovation and genuine self-expression.|$|E
60|$|Public ceremonies, such as ordinations, the {{installation}} of magistrates, and all that could give majesty to the forms in which a new government manifested itself to the people, were, {{as a matter of}} policy, marked by a stately and well-conducted ceremonial, and a sombre, but yet a studied magnificence. Deep ruffs, painfully wrought bands, and gorgeously embroidered gloves, were all deemed necessary to the official state of men assuming the reins of power, and were readily allowed to individuals dignified by rank or wealth, even while sumptuary laws forbade these and similar extravagances to the plebeian order. In the array of funerals, too--whether for the apparel of the dead body, or to <b>typify,</b> <b>by</b> manifold emblematic devices of sable cloth and snowy lawn, the sorrow of the survivors--there was a frequent and characteristic demand for such labour as Hester Prynne could supply. Baby-linen--for babies then wore robes of state--afforded still another possibility of toil and emolument.|$|R
50|$|In {{the absence}} of sizable {{participation}} of the Asians and Europeans, the anti-colonial movement led by Musazi consisted of essentially two tendencies: the ambivalent nationalism <b>typified</b> and led <b>by</b> Musazi, and the true (Kohn, H. 1964: 64) nationalism yet unorganized and leaderless.|$|R
50|$|The {{philosophy}} of 17th-century Europe marks the departure from medieval scholasticism and the often occultist approach of Renaissance philosophy.The period was <b>typified</b> in Europe <b>by</b> the great system-builders, philosophers who presented unified systems of epistemology, metaphysics, logic, and ethics and often {{politics and the}} physical sciences as well.|$|R
5|$|In {{the visual}} arts, {{narcissi}} are depicted {{in three different}} contexts, mythological (Narcissus, Persephone), floral art, or landscapes. The Narcissus story has been popular with painters and the youth is frequently depicted with flowers to indicate this association. The Persephone theme is also <b>typified</b> <b>by</b> Waterhouse in his Narcissus, the floral motif by van Scorel and the landscape by Van Gogh's Undergrowth.|$|E
5|$|Initial Vulcanian {{activity}} {{is characterized by}} a series of short-lived explosions, lasting a few minutes to a few hours and <b>typified</b> <b>by</b> the ejection of volcanic bombs and blocks. These eruptions wear down the lava dome holding the magma down, and it disintegrates, leading to much more quiet and continuous eruptions. Thus an early sign of future Vulcanian {{activity is}} lava dome growth, and its collapse generates an outpouring of pyroclastic material down the volcano's slope.|$|E
5|$|The second eruptive period, the Cougar Stage, started 20,000 {{years ago}} and lasted for 2,000 years. Pyroclastic flows of hot pumice and ash along with dome growth {{occurred}} during this period. Another 5,000 years of dormancy followed, only to be upset {{by the beginning of}} the Swift Creek eruptive period, <b>typified</b> <b>by</b> pyroclastic flows, dome growth and blanketing of the countryside with tephra. Swift Creek ended 8,000 years ago.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the queen}} began to {{institute}} changes in court customs. Some of them {{met with the}} disapproval of the older generation, such as the abandonment of heavy make-up and the popular wide-hooped panniers. The new fashion called for a simpler feminine look, <b>typified</b> first <b>by</b> the rustic robe à la polonaise style and later by the gaulle, a layered muslin dress Marie Antoinette wore in a 1783 Vigée-Le Brun portrait. In 1780 she began to participate in amateur plays and musicals in a theatre built for her by Richard Mique at the Petit Trianon.|$|R
40|$|Recent rapid {{technological}} and medical advance {{has more than}} ever before brought to the fore a spectrum of problems broadly categorized under the umbrella of ‘ethics of human enhancement’.

5|$|While Texas had won its independence, {{political}} battles raged {{between two}} factions {{of the new}} Republic. The nationalist faction, led by Mirabeau B. Lamar, advocated the continued independence of Texas, the expulsion of the Native Americans, {{and the expansion of}} the Republic to the Pacific Ocean. Their opponents, led by Sam Houston, advocated the annexation of Texas to the United States and peaceful co-existence with Native Americans. The conflict between the factions was <b>typified</b> <b>by</b> an incident known as the Texas Archive War.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines can {{be useful}} for {{short-term}} treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due {{to the risk of}} dependence. It is preferred that benzodiazepines be taken intermittently and at the lowest effective dose. They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep, prolonging the sleep time, and, in general, reducing wakefulness. However, they worsen sleep quality by increasing light sleep and decreasing deep sleep. Other drawbacks of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, are possible tolerance to their effects, rebound insomnia, and reduced slow-wave sleep and a withdrawal period <b>typified</b> <b>by</b> rebound insomnia and a prolonged period of anxiety and agitation.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{considered}} Ankylosaurus so distinct {{that he made}} it {{the type}} genus of a new family, Ankylosauridae (members of which are called ankylosaurids), <b>typified</b> <b>by</b> massive, triangular skulls, short necks, stiff backs, broad bodies, and osteoderms. He also classified Palaeoscincus (only known from teeth), and Euoplocephalus (then only known from a partial skull and osteoderms) {{as part of the}} family. Due to the fragmentary remains, Brown was unable to fully distinguish between Euoplocephalus and Ankylosaurus. Only having few, incomplete members of the family to compare with, he believed the group was part of the suborder Stegosauria. In 1923, Osborn coined the name Ankylosauria (members of which are called ankylosaurs or ankylosaurians), thereby placing the ankylosaurids in their own suborder.|$|E

The developed strategy is based on the “maximum production rate ” criterion and incorporates eight technological constraints. The optimum number of passes is determined via dynamic programming, and the optimal values of the cutting conditions are found based on the objective function developed for the <b>typified</b> criterion <b>by</b> using a non-linear program-ming technique called “geometric programming”. This paper also underlies the importance of using optimiz-ation strategies rather than handbook recommendations as well as pointing out the superiority of the multi...|$|R

50|$|Idaho City {{experiences}} a fairly typical Inland Northwest continental Mediterranean climate (Köppen Dsb) with cold, snowy winters and warm, dry summers, <b>typified</b> throughout <b>by</b> large diurnal temperature variations. The town averages 217 nights below 32 F per year - {{as many as}} Fairbanks, Alaska and 100 more than nearby Boise - 24 days which fail to top freezing, and 14 nights that fall below 0 F. Owing to its more exposed location and slightly higher altitude, {{it is not only}} noticeably cooler but also much wetter than Boise, receiving twice as much precipitation and almost four times as much snowfall, which averages 71.6 in with a maximum daily snow cover of 46 in in January 1982.|$|R
5|$|Characters of Shakespear's Plays is an 1817 book of {{criticism}} of Shakespeare's plays, written by early nineteenth century English essayist and literary critic William Hazlitt. Composed {{in reaction to the}} neoclassical approach to Shakespeare's plays <b>typified</b> <b>by</b> Samuel Johnson, it was among the first English-language studies of Shakespeare's plays to follow the manner of German critic August Wilhelm Schlegel, and, with the work of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, {{paved the way for the}} increased appreciation of Shakespeare's genius that was characteristic of later nineteenth-century criticism. It was also the first book to cover all of Shakespeare's plays, intended as a guide for the general reader.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, the Boston {{architectural}} firm Cram, Goodhue, and Ferguson {{was awarded a}} major construction contract that set the predominantly neogothic architectural style still seen today. Most of the buildings of the central cadet area are in this style, as <b>typified</b> <b>by</b> the Cadet Chapel, completed in 1910. These buildings are nearly all constructed from granite that has a predominantly gray and black hue. The barracks that {{were built in the}} 1960s were designed to mimic this style. Other buildings on post, notably the oldest private residences for the faculty, are built in the Federal, Georgian, or English Tudor styles. A few buildings, such as Cullum Hall and the Old Cadet Chapel, are built in the Neoclassical style.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{architecture}} {{is a combination}} between local and other influences. It has traditionally been <b>typified</b> <b>by</b> wooden structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs. Sliding doors (fusuma) were used in place of walls, allowing the internal configuration of a space to be customized for different occasions. People usually sat on cushions or otherwise on the floor, traditionally; chairs and high tables were not widely used until the 20th century. Since the 19th century, however, Japan has incorporated much of Western, modern, and post-modern architecture into construction and design, and is today a leader in cutting-edge architectural design and technology.|$|E
40|$|Nucleotide {{modification}} is a {{major source}} of structural and biochemical diversity of RNAs, particularly of rRNAs and tRNAs (Rozenski et al., 1999). Base-specific methylation is one of the prevalent modes of post-transcriptional modification along with pseudo-uridylation and thio-uridylation. The catalytic domains of the majority of RNA methylases belong to the vast la rge superc lass o f Rossman- fo ld enzymes (Lo Conte et al., 2000). These Rossman-fold methy-lases (RFM) bind S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) via the nucleotide-binding loop typical of this fold and catalyze the transfer of its methyl group to substrates such as DNA, RNA, proteins or small molecules. However, two families of RNA methylases, <b>typified,</b> respectively, <b>by</b> Escherichia coli proteins SpoU (TrmH...|$|R
50|$|Informed by improvisational {{practices}} that celebrate the chaotic and polyvocal and {{driven by a}} deep interest in materials and what {{they might be able}} to do, Anne Bean's practice has been influenced by Joseph Beuys’ concept of social sculpture (soziale Plastik) as well as the strange humour associated with the 1970s English performance art scene, <b>typified</b> perhaps <b>by</b> her extensive collaborations with the Kipper Kids. Bean's interest in collaborative processes began with her work with the pioneering performance art group Bernsteins, with Jonathan Harvey, Malcolm Jones, and the Kipper Kids , and continued to develop during her longterm working relationship with the drummer-artist Paul Burwell, and sculptor Richard Wilson. Together they formed the performance group, the Bow Gamelan Ensemble (1983-90).|$|R
50|$|Self-taught, {{he began}} his career as a {{decorator}} in the Netherlands, and then pursued painting full-time. He achieved some note when the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam purchased one of his early pictures. He arrived in South Africa in 1921, practicing a sober style within the Dutch tradition, <b>typified</b> there <b>by</b> Still Life with Birds and Hare. The light and landscape of South Africa soon caused him to abandon his muted palette in favour of more saturated colours. His formulaic approach to painting Cape landscapes with gabled farmhouses created such a demand that he abandoned his considered brushwork in favour of a broader palette knife technique. His etchings sold in the hundreds through his dealer Louis Woolf.|$|R
5|$|Sculptural figuration was {{to become}} a {{hallmark}} of van der Weyden's mature work, and is best <b>typified</b> <b>by</b> the Madrid Descent, where the mourning figures are shaped and take on poses more usually seen in sculpture. Erwin Panofsky identified this work and The Madonna Standing as van der Weyden's earliest extant work; they are also his smallest panels. Panofsky dated both panels as 1432–34, and believed them to be early works based on stylistic reasons, their near miniature scale, and because of the evident influences of both Campin and van Eyck.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} music are {{traditionally}} associated with Marrakesh. Berber music is influenced by Andalusian classical music and <b>typified</b> <b>by</b> its oud accompaniment. By contrast, Gnaoua music is loud and funky with a sound reminiscent of the Blues. It is performed on handmade instruments such as castanets, ribabs (three-stringed banjos) and deffs (handheld drums). Gnaoua music's rhythm and crescendo take the audience into a mood of trance; the style {{is said to have}} emerged in Marrakesh and Essaouira as a ritual of deliverance from slavery. More recently, several Marrakesh female music groups have also risen to popularity.|$|E
5|$|By {{the reign}} of ArchelausI in the 5th century BC, the ancient Macedonian elite was {{importing}} customs and artistic traditions from other regions of Greece while retaining more archaic, perhaps Homeric, funerary rites connected with the symposium that were <b>typified</b> <b>by</b> items such as the decorative metal kraters that held the ashes of deceased Macedonian nobility in their tombs. Among these is the large bronze Derveni Krater from a 4th-centuryBC tomb of Thessaloniki, decorated with scenes of the Greek god Dionysus and his entourage and belonging to an aristocrat who had had a military career. Macedonian metalwork usually followed Athenian styles of vase shapes from the 6thcenturyBC onward, with drinking vessels, jewellery, containers, crowns, diadems, and coins among the many metal objects found in Macedonian tombs.|$|E
