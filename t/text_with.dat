Research {{completed}} at Department of Psychology, Fairmount College of Liberal Arts and SciencesTexting while driving is risky, yet common. Smartphones {{are not the only}} devices though which are capable of texting. Google Glass is an upcoming head-mounted display (HMD) that allows users to text via a voice-based interface. This study investigated the effects of <b>texting</b> <b>with</b> Google Glass on driving performance compared to <b>texting</b> <b>with</b> a smartphone. Participants completed a standard car-following task in a driving simulator. There were three possible texting methods: manual <b>texting</b> <b>with</b> a smartphone, voice-based <b>texting</b> <b>with</b> a smartphone, and voice-based <b>texting</b> <b>with</b> Google Glass. All texting methods impaired driving performance compared to the drive-only condition. <b>Texting</b> <b>with</b> Google Glass, however, was less disruptive to driving performance compared to <b>texting</b> <b>with</b> the smartphone for both manual and voice-based texting. The results suggest that the Google Glass configuration may be beneficial to driving performance. However, Google Glass may still be harmful to driving safety.

5|$|As the 18th century dawned, Sicilian architects were {{employed}} to create the new palazzi and churches.

Their work inspired less-travelled Sicilian designers. Very importantly, these architects were also assisted by the books of engravings by Domenico de' Rossi, who for the first time wrote down <b>text</b> <b>with</b> his engravings, giving the precise dimensions and measurements of many of the principal Renaissance and Baroque façades in Rome. In this way, the Renaissance finally came late to Sicily by proxy.|$|E

He continually revised the manuscript, and it remained in an unfinished state on his death.

5|$|Li Shizhen (1518–93) – one of {{the most}} renowned pharmacologists and {{physicians}} in Chinese history – belonged to the late Ming period. His Bencao Gangmu is a medical <b>text</b> <b>with</b> 1,892 entries, each entry with its own name called a gang. The mu in the title refers to the synonyms of each name. Inoculation, although it can be traced to earlier Chinese folk medicine, was detailed in Chinese texts by the sixteenth century. Throughout the Ming dynasty, around fifty texts were published on the treatment of smallpox. In regards to oral hygiene, the ancient Egyptians had a primitive toothbrush of a twig frayed at the end, but the Chinese were the first to invent the modern bristle toothbrush in 1498, although it used stiff pig hair.|$|E

5|$|In November 2009 Cameron {{and others}} {{distributed}} free copies of an altered version of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species {{on college campuses}} in the United States. The book consisted of Darwin's <b>text</b> <b>with</b> chapters of the book removed, and with an added introduction by Ray Comfort reiterating common creationist assertions about Darwin and evolution. The book was criticized by scientists and Darwin biographers who criticized the omission of key chapters of the book, and who stated that its introduction contains misinformation about Darwin, and long-refuted creationist arguments about the science of evolution, such as the linking of Nazi racial theories to Darwinist ideas. Comfort later said that the four chapters were chosen at random to be omitted {{in order to make}} the book small enough to be affordable as a giveaway, with the absent chapters available for download, but that the missing chapters were included in the second edition, which had a smaller text size that made printing the entire book as a giveaway affordable. The second edition still lacks Darwin's preface and glossary of terms. The National Center for Science Education arranged a campaign to distribute an analysis of the Comfort introduction and a banana bookmark at colleges across the U.S., a reference to Comfort's presentation of the banana as an argument for the existence of God.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{postulated}} {{that at one}} time the manuscript was in the possession of Cardinal Bessarion, because the minuscule supplement has a text similar to one of Bessarion's manuscripts. T. C. Skeat believes that Bessarion's mentor, the patriarchal notary in Constantinople John Chortasmenos, had the book brought to Rome from Constantinople {{around the time of the}} fall of the Byzantine Empire. According to Paul Canart, the decorative initials added to the manuscript in the Middle Ages are reminiscent of Constantinopolitan decoration of the 10th century, but the poor execution gives the impression they were added in the 11th or 12th century, and likely not before the 12th century in light of the way they appear in connection with notes in a minuscule hand at the beginning of the book of Daniel. T. C. Skeat, a paleographer at the British Museum, first argued that Codex Vaticanus was among the 50 Bibles that the Emperor Constantine I ordered Eusebius of Caesarea to produce. The similarity of the <b>text</b> <b>with</b> the papyri and Coptic version (including some letter formation), parallels with Athanasius' canon of 367 suggest an Egyptian or Alexandrian origin.|$|E
5|$|Josquin likely {{learned his}} craft {{in his home}} region in the North, in France, and then in Italy {{when he went to}} Milan and Rome. His early sacred works emulate the contrapuntal {{complexity}} and ornamented, melismatic lines of Ockeghem and his contemporaries, {{but at the same time}} he was learning his contrapuntal technique he was acquiring an Italianate idiom for his secular music: after all, he was surrounded by Italian popular music in Milan. By the end of his long creative career, which spanned approximately 50 productive years, he had developed a simplified style in which each voice of a polyphonic composition exhibited free and smooth motion, and close attention was paid to clear setting of text as well as clear alignment of <b>text</b> <b>with</b> musical motifs. While other composers were influential on the development of Josquin's style, especially in the late 15th century, he himself became the most influential composer in Europe, especially after the development of music printing, which was concurrent with the years of his maturity and peak output. This event made his influence even more decisive than it might otherwise have been.|$|E
5|$|Stela 4 {{was found}} in the {{northern}} part of the East Plaza. It was the only monument at El Chal to have been sculpted on both sides and had been moved from its original location. Due to its sculptural style and its location, it is believed to have been associated with Altars 3 and 4. The upper portion of the front of the stela bears a hieroglyphic <b>text</b> <b>with</b> a calendrical date that has been interpreted as 9.16.10.0.0. 1 Ahau 3 Zip (17 March 761) together with the site's Emblem Glyph. This side of the stela depicts a Maya bloodletting ritual with a richly dressed person standing with legs apart standing on top of three sitting prisoners, the middle of which bears his own name written upon his left leg. The principal figure bears a spear topped by a serpent head with a flint spearhead emerging from it. This spear is very similar in style to one depicted on Stela 8 at Naranjo. The reverse of the stela depicts three individuals standing upon a monster mask seen in profile. A child or youth is seated before two adult figures. All of them wear rectangular headdresses and hold something in their hands that cannot now be distinguished. Hieroglyphic texts are carved above the heads of the two standing figures and probably represent their names. The sculptural style of the two sides is different, and the foot-level of the standing figures on each side is different, with the figures on the reverse being positioned higher up the shaft than the figure on the front. This probably indicates that both sides were sculpted in situ at different times, with the reverse of the stela being crafted after the floor level of the plaza had risen to cover the base of the front side.|$|E
