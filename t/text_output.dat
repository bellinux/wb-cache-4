2500|$|As with Unix {{pipelines}}, PowerShell pipelines can construct complex commands, {{using the}} | operator to connect stages. However, the PowerShell pipeline differs from Unix pipelines in that stages execute within the PowerShell runtime {{rather than as}} a set of processes coordinated by the operating system, and structured [...]NET objects, rather than byte streams, are passed from one stage to the next. Using objects and executing stages within the PowerShell runtime eliminates the need to serialize data structures, or to extract them by explicitly parsing <b>text</b> <b>output.</b> An object can also encapsulate certain functions that work on the contained data, which become available to the recipient command for use. For the last cmdlet in a pipeline, PowerShell automatically pipes its output object to the Out-Default cmdlet, which transforms the objects into a stream of format objects and then renders those to the screen.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{recent years}} the use of {{statistical}} language models (SLMs) has become widespread in most NLP fields. In this work we introduce jNina, a basic language modelling tool to aid the development of Machine Translation systems and many other text-generating applications. The tool allows for the quick comparison of multiple <b>text</b> <b>outputs</b> (e. g., alternative translations of a single source) based on a given SLM, and enables the user to build and evaluate her own SLMs from any corpora provided. 1...|$|R

Many {{examples}} use the print function instead of the echo function. Both functions are nearly identical; the major difference being that print is slower than echo because the former will return a status indicating if it was successful or not in addition to <b>text</b> to <b>output,</b> whereas the latter does not return a status and only returns the <b>text</b> for <b>output.</b>|$|R

RIPscrip used separate text and graphics displays, one each, and although it could draw text into the graphics screen, the speed of doing so was such {{that it was not}} useful for general <b>text</b> <b>output</b> or editing. Generally, a system using RIPscrip would use the graphics screen for presenting menus, with conventional editing and input taking place in the text screen. RIPscrip would not normally be used to build a conventional GUI with multiple windows or mouse-driven text editing, for instance.|$|E
