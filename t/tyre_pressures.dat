25|$|At {{the start}} of the Grand Prix, Senna {{retained}} the lead from Schumacher, but proceedings soon became interrupted by a startline accident. JJ Lehto's Benetton-Ford had stalled and was hit by the Lotus-Mugen Honda of Pedro Lamy. A wheel and debris landed in the main grandstand, injuring eight fans and a police officer. The safety car, a sporty version of the Opel Vectra medium family saloon, was deployed for several laps. The Vectra's slow pace was later questioned because of the consequential drop in <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> on the Formula One cars. Senna had pulled alongside the Vectra and gestured to the driver, Max Angelelli, to increase his speed. On lap 6, the race resumed and Senna immediately set a quick pace with the third-quickest lap of the race, followed by Schumacher.|$|E
25|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of the Australian motoring community regarded the device as pseudoscience, and Brock's promotion of it drove away HDT drivers like John Harvey, Allan Moffat and Larry Perkins. Brock also recommended <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> of 22psi (150kPa) for his polariser-equipped vehicles, a level which many regarded as near-dangerously low. Holden, fearing the consequences of being associated with the device and a resulting breakdown in communications over Brock's plans for new models, cut ties with Brock and set up an alternative racing/modification operation, Holden Special Vehicles. During this period, Brock also became involved in the importation and even the modification of the Lada Samara, a cheap Soviet-built hatchback a world away from the high-performance V8-powered Commodores he was famous for. The Lada deal came at the right time for the Brock organisation as it saved the struggling outfit from potential bankruptcy.|$|E
25|$|Some drivers {{elected to}} make pit stops {{for the change}} to the soft {{compound}} tyres; Ferrari brought both their drivers in {{to enable them to}} reach the end of the race without making another pit stop. Hamilton's race engineer Peter Bonnington warned him about the debris but Hamilton did not receive the warning fast enough and drove over shards of wing. He asked his team about <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> and was told no issues had been discovered. Sutil was issued with a five-second stop-and-go penalty for the collision with Pérez. The safety car was withdrawn {{at the end of the}} 37th lap and racing resumed with Hamilton leading the field back up to speed. Hamilton set the fastest lap of the race at one minute and 50.417 seconds on lap 39 to pull out a 5.8 second advantage over Vettel. Sutil's car developed a water leak and retired two laps later to prevent the risk of his engine failing. Button drew closer to Bottas while Hülkenberg moved ahead of Kvyat for 11th position. Pérez took advantage of a battle between Ericsson and Kvyat and overtook both drivers for 14th on lap 49.|$|E

40|$|Tyres are a {{final output}} torque {{of the vehicle}} before all the forces are {{distributed}} to the road surface as a tractive force. When the <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> changed, it had a direct effect on rolling resistance force of the vehicle and reduced the tractive force. Moreover, it {{had an effect on}} a rate of fuel consumption and driving comfort. This research had tested the effect of <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> of 25 psi and 45 psi to determine the total resistance force between the vehicle speed from 40 km/hr to 100 km/hr and compare with the reference <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> of 35 psi by using the “coast-down technique”. The results from calculation showed the total resistance force when the vehicle speed was zero from <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> of 25 psi increased by 48. 52 % from reference value and the total resistance force from <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> of 45 psi decreased by 13. 46 % from the reference <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure.</b> The different resistance force from <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> of 35 psi with the other 2 values of <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> in the research were called the different rolling resistance force because the vehicle changed only <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> which had no effect on aerodynamics drag. The relationship of the different rolling resistance force along the test speed from <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> of 25 psi and 45 psi decreased while the vehicle speed increased. The relationship can be fitted with a linear equation. The slope from <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> of 25 psi was 0. 2358 which was steeper than the slope of 0. 0828 from 45 psi <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure.</b> These were the effect of tyre characteristic that made from rubber. When the vehicle speed was low, the frequency of tyre deformation was also low and resulted in high energy loss from hysteresis phenomena. Therefore high rolling resistance force was generated. Considering the effect of tyre under high vehicle speed, the frequency of tyre deformation increased and made the molecule of rubber vibrate more than low vehicle speed. These effects made the tyre stiffer than low frequency and resulted in decreasing the rolling resistance force. In additional, high frequency that caused by high <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> had effected on driving comfort in a real driving condition...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{understood}} that fuel economy directly influences the CO 2 emissions in vehicles. Thus, a straightforward approach {{to reduce the}} tailpipe CO 2 emissions {{is to reduce the}} overall fuel consumption of the vehicle. In this thesis work the role of <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> on the fuel economy is investigated. Apart from the benefits of reduced fuel consumption, <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> also {{plays an important role in}} deciding vehicle handling and passenger comfort. Three mathematical vehicle models have been developed in the Matlab/Simulink® interface, to capture and represent the influence of <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> on fuel consumption, vehicle handling and ride characteristics. The first model is a full-vehicle model developed to enable quick and reliable estimation of fuel consumption with the change in <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure.</b> The second model is a two-track vehicle model developed to study the changes in vehicle lateral behaviour when the <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> is changed. The third model is a half-car model that is designed to evaluate the changes in vertical acceleration response of the vehicle with change in <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure.</b> When the full-vehicle model was simulated for the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC city cycle), fuel consumption reduction up to 5 % was observed simply by increasing the <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressures</b> from 2 bar to 3 bar. The vehicle handling also improved considerably especially when <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> was maintained higher on the outer wheels and lower on the inner wheels of the vehicle in a turn. For smooth roads found within city limits, it was observed that the <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> affected the ride comfort only marginally. However as road roughness increased, the impact of <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> on ride comfort also increased. Through these findings, a foundation is established for the development of a dynamic <b>Tyre</b> <b>Pressure</b> Regulating System (TPRS) that is capable of regulating the <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> in all four wheels, independently and continuously...|$|R
500|$|Engel was {{the quickest}} {{driver in the}} fourth group, and {{finished}} ahead of d'Ambrosio and Rosenqvist who struggled for decent pace. Gutiérrez and Adam Carroll were the fourth group's slowest two drivers, and at the group qualifying's conclusion, the lap times set by Abt, Engel, López, Turvey and Vergne were fast enough to enable them progression into the super pole round. Vergne was the first competitor to attempt to record a lap time in super pole; {{he was unable to}} achieve a rhythm and placed fifth. Engel was slower in the track's first sector, but went faster {{in the second part of}} the track by two-tenths of a second to clinch third. López went quicker in the circuit's first two sectors but was unable to go faster in the final sector and was restricted to qualifying fourth. Abt was two-tenths of a second quicker than the previous three drivers in the first sector. Although he lost a small amount of time in the second sector, Abt took provisional pole position with a time of one minute and 2.711 seconds. Turvey lost time while completing his lap and qualified in second. The result would have meant Abt securing his first pole position of the season, the second of his career, and his first since the 2015 Long Beach ePrix, but his car's <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> were found to have been below the mandated minimum pressure of [...] Abt was consequently demoted to 18th. Further grid penalties were applied when Engel and his teammate Sarrazin dropped ten places because of them changing their gearboxes. The application of Abt's penalty meant Turvey secured the first pole position of his career.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn road cycling, <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> has an {{influence}} on both performance and comfort of the cyclist. In this paper, the relationship between <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> and shock perception at the cyclist's hands was quantitatively analysed by measuring the Just Noticeable Difference in Level (JNDL) of <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure.</b> The JNDL was determined by using a three-alternative forced-choice (3 -AFC) method. The measurement was carried out on seven healthy subjects exposed to shock-type excitation on a laboratory bicycle treadmill. The dispersion of the measured <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> JNDL (69 to 241 kPa; mean 155 kPa; SD 73 kPa) shows a large variability in the hands’ perception of shock in the cyclists tested. This suggests that some cyclists have a better capacity than others to differentiate impact sensory inputs at the hands, making them more likely to discern subtle differences in bicycle response dynamics...|$|R
