2500|$|The {{average of}} the <b>true</b> <b>solar</b> <b>day</b> {{during the course of}} an entire year is the mean solar day, which {{contains}} [...] solar seconds. Currently, each of these seconds is slightly longer than an SI second because Earth's mean solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal friction. The average length of the mean solar day since the introduction of the leap second in 1972 has been about 0 to 2 ms longer than 86,400 SI seconds. Random fluctuations due to core-mantle coupling have an amplitude of about 5 ms. The mean solar second between 1750 and 1892 was chosen in 1895 by Simon Newcomb as the independent unit of time in his Tables of the Sun. These tables were used to calculate the world's ephemerides between 1900 and 1983, so this second became known as the ephemeris second. In 1967 the SI second was made equal to the ephemeris second.|$|E
2500|$|About 140 AD, Ptolemy, the Alexandrian astronomer, sexagesimally {{subdivided}} {{both the}} {{mean solar day}} and the <b>true</b> <b>solar</b> <b>day</b> to at least six places after the sexagesimal point, and he used simple fractions of both the equinoctial hour and the seasonal hour, none of which resemble the modern second.

With this definition, the second was proposed in 1874 as the base unit {{of time in the}} CGS system of units. Soon afterwards Simon Newcomb and others discovered that Earth's rotation period varied irregularly, so in 1952, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) defined the second as a fraction of the sidereal year. Because the tropical year was considered more fundamental than the sidereal year, in 1955, the IAU redefined the second as the fraction [...] of the 1900.0 mean tropical year, which was adopted in 1956 by the International Committee for Weights and Measures and in 1960 by the General Conference on Weights and Measures, becoming a part of the International System of Units (SI).|$|E

5000|$|In {{recent decades}} {{the average length}} of a <b>solar</b> <b>day</b> on Earth has been about 86 400.002 seconds (24.000 000 6 hours) and there are about 365.242 2 <b>solar</b> <b>days</b> in one mean {{tropical}} year. Because celestial orbits are not perfectly circular, and thus objects travel at different speeds at various positions in their orbit, a <b>solar</b> <b>day</b> is not the same length of time throughout the orbital year. A day, understood as the span of time it takes for the Earth to make one entire rotationwith respect to the celestial background or a distant star (assumed to be fixed), is called a stellar day. This period of rotation is about 4 minutes less than 24 hours (23 hours 56 minutes and 4.1 seconds) and there are about 366.242 2 stellar days in one mean tropical year (one stellar day more than the number of <b>solar</b> <b>days).</b> Mainly due to tidal effects, the Earth's rotational period is not constant, resulting in further minor variations for both <b>solar</b> <b>days</b> and stellar [...] "days". Other planets and moons have stellar and <b>solar</b> <b>days</b> of different lengths to Earth's.|$|R
5000|$|Earth's {{rotational}} speed is very slowly decreasing because of tidal deceleration; this increases {{the length of}} the mean <b>solar</b> <b>day.</b> The length of the SI second was calibrated {{on the basis of the}} second of ephemeris time and can now be seen to have a relationship with the mean <b>solar</b> <b>day</b> observed between 1750 and 1892, analysed by Simon Newcomb. As a result, the SI second is close to 1/86400 of a mean <b>solar</b> <b>day</b> in the mid‑19th century. In earlier centuries, the mean <b>solar</b> <b>day</b> was shorter than 86,400 SI seconds, and in more recent centuries it is longer than 86,400 seconds. Near the end of the 20th century, {{the length of the}} mean <b>solar</b> <b>day</b> (also known simply as [...] "length of day" [...] or [...] "LOD") was approximately 86,400.0013 s. For this reason, UT is now [...] "slower" [...] than TAI by the difference (or [...] "excess" [...] LOD) of 1.3 ms/day.|$|R
25|$|However, for {{the past}} several centuries, the length of the mean <b>solar</b> <b>day</b> has been {{increasing}} by about 1.4–1.7 ms per century, depending on the averaging time. By 1961, the mean <b>solar</b> <b>day</b> was already a millisecond or two longer than 86,400 SI seconds. Therefore, time standards that change the date after precisely 86,400 SI seconds, such as the International Atomic Time (TAI), will get increasingly ahead of time standards tied to the mean <b>solar</b> <b>day,</b> such as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).|$|R
