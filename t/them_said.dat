5|$|Despite Malawi's limited {{health and}} {{educational}} infrastructure, knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS is high among many {{people living in}} both urban and rural Malawi. According to a 2004 study by Barden-O'Fallon et al. involving 100 households, women in Malawi {{are most likely to}} learn about HIV/AIDS through radio and television, health workers at local clinics, and female members of their social networks. Men are also likely to access information about HIV/AIDS through radio and television; however, unlike women, they are not likely to gain information about HIV/AIDS from their male friends. When 57 Malawian men were interviewed in 2003, 100% of <b>them</b> <b>said</b> they had heard about the HIV/AIDS epidemic on the radio, and 84.2% of <b>them</b> <b>said</b> they had learned about HIV/AIDS during their visits to local health facilities; this supports the fact that many people in Malawi have access to information about the epidemic, both through the radio and other sources.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} legends {{to how the}} town of Modoc got its name. One of <b>them</b> <b>said</b> that a man {{travelling}} on the train threw out a cigar box containing the name Modoc, and that Henry Conley, {{one of the first}} settlers of the town, picked it up and suggested to bystanders {{that it would be a}} good name for the town. Another theory is that Modoc was named after the Modoc people who were traditionally located in northern California. They became noted for their resistance to the US Army during the Modoc War, ending in 1873.|$|E

Their black Flag, under which they had committed abundance of Pyracies and Murders, was affix'd to one Corner of the Gallows. It had in it the Portraiture of Death, with an Hour-Glass in one Hand, and a Dart in the other, striking into a Heart, and three Drops of Blood delineated as falling from it.

25|$|It {{was only}} after {{the advent of the}} Portuguese in the region that Christianity began to be propagated. In 1498, the Portuguese {{explorer}} Vasco Da Gama landed on a group of islands in South Canara on his voyage from Portugal to India. He named them El Padron de Santa Maria, which later {{came to be known as}} St Mary's Islands. In 1500, Pedro Álvares Cabral, a Portuguese explorer, arrived at Anjediva with eight Franciscan missionaries. These missionaries under the leadership of Henrique Soares de Coimbra converted 22 or 23 natives to Christianity in the Mangalore region. On 19 November 1502, some Christians of Mangalore and other interior places went with presents to meet Vasco da Gama, who was in Cochin. These Christian ambassadors told da Gama that they had their bishops and all of <b>them</b> <b>said</b> mass. They also told him that they undertook pilgrimages to the sepulcher of St. Thomas. Even prior to Alfonso de Albuquerque's conquest of Goa in 1510, the Portuguese had some settlements in Canara. It was easy for the Portuguese to send re-inforcements of missionaries to the existing stations in Canara and also to advance the work of evangelization. During the early part of the 16th century, Canara was ruled by Krishnadevaraya (1509–1529), the ruler of the Vijayanagara Empire of Deccan. As it was not possible for the Portuguese to enter Canara with Krishnadevaraya as ruler, a Portuguese alliance with Krishnadevaraya was the only way to enter Canara. Krishnadevaraya granted commercial privileges to the Portuguese on the Canara coast and there was complete freedom of worship, belief and propagation of religious tenets in the Vijaynagara Empire.|$|E

Actually I feel like I am an advocate for the riders. I look at them as being treated like lab rats that are test vehicles for the doctors.

On the preceding tour of Pakistan a few months earlier, Waugh had appeared before a Pakistan Cricket Board judicial inquiry in Lahore to present his claims against Malik; the inquiry questioned the credibility of both Australian players and asked them to return to Pakistan to re-present their accounts of the events.|$|E

Several prisoners told the court that it contained no bed, so that prisoners had to lie on the damp floor, possibly next to corpses awaiting burial. But a group of favoured prisoners Acton had paid to police the jail told the hearing there was indeed a bed. One of <b>them</b> <b>said</b> he often chose to lie in there himself, because the strong room was so clean; the [...] "best room on the Common side of the jail", said another.

Subsequently, Antoinists were allowed to move the body, initially in the pauper's grave, to the town cemetery. In 1920, Antoine's widow asked the country's Queen to allow her the carry the body in the temple garden of Jemeppe where a chapel would be erected, but this request failed.|$|E
500|$|Complex {{named it}} the second best {{song of the}} first half of 2014. Writer Justin Charity commented saying, [...] "While hardly their strongest verses of even the past couple years, Ross, Kanye, and Sean all come correct with the quotables here, from Sean's opening mantra to Kanye's {{aggressive}} confessional to post-sex grilled cheese. The song's weary gospel build-up makes way for the minimal, rarefied ecstasy of that spaceship hangover melody. An arena confession I need to be shouting at the livest of live shows by year's end: [...] "All I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch!" [...] Verdict: We need another Yeezus." [...] MySpace also named the song one of the 50 best songs of the same time period.

Middleton {{was in the hospital}} undergoing testing for some heart irregularity when the telegram arrived, and he showed it to two other lieutenant colonels who were visiting him. One of <b>them</b> <b>said</b> he should take the offer, the salary being excellent. The other lieutenant colonel, Dwight Eisenhower, said he should stay in the army. Eisenhower had spent three years in Panama as an aide to General Fox Conner, who knew that the terms of the Treaty of Versailles were being ignored by Adolf Hitler and the Nazis, and who was certain another war was coming soon. Eisenhower reasoned that this was no time for an officer with Middleton's combat experience to be getting out of the Army.|$|E
500|$|Opinions on the game's visual style varied. Walton {{called the}} game's visuals [...] "some {{of the best}} ever seen on the Wii", which was echoed to a degree by MacDonald.

Edge was fairly mixed, saying that well-done environmental effects or the world-building through character banter were spoiled by low-quality textures and stilted character animations. Juba praised the character models, but found environments to be [...] "ugly and muddy in comparison"; Fuller, while not actively criticizing <b>them,</b> <b>said</b> that players used to high-definition consoles would be disappointed.

Nintendo Power said that the graphics gave the game's setting an [...] "authentic" [...] appearance despite some low-resolution textures, while Eurogamer praised them for their [...] "sepia tone". Frame rate drops during moments of high activity were generally noted by reviewers. Uematsu's incidental scoring also received praise from multiple critics.|$|E

[...] Marcus goes on to say, [...] "Now, how did it enter their lives? We're talking about an album that was recorded well before they were born, and yet it spoke to them.

And he put on Van Morrison's Astral Weeks. And it stirred me. I'd never heard anything like it."
