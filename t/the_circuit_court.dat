5|$|An 1872 statute {{modified}} the certificate of division procedure to require {{waiting for a}} final decision in <b>the</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>court</b> case first.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Circuit</b> <b>Courts</b> are {{courts of}} general jurisdiction, {{meaning that they}} can hear all manner of civil and {{criminal}} matters, with limited exceptions. The original jurisdiction of <b>the</b> <b>Circuit</b> <b>Courts</b> over civil matters extends only to those matters valued at over $4,500. For actions alleging a lower amount in controversy, jurisdiction lies with the Virginia General District <b>Court</b> (GDC). However, <b>the</b> <b>Circuit</b> <b>Courts</b> can hear appeals from the GDC for matters valued over $50. Such appeals are heard de novo. <b>The</b> <b>Circuit</b> <b>Courts</b> do not, however, have jurisdiction over rate cases or workers' compensation cases. The former {{are committed to the}} jurisdiction of the State Corporation Commission, the latter by the Virginia Workers' Compensation Commission. <b>The</b> <b>Circuit</b> <b>Courts</b> have exclusive original jurisdiction in domestic relations matters (such as divorce, annulment, and child custody), and over the probate of wills.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Alabama <b>Circuit</b> <b>Courts</b> are <b>the</b> state trial {{courts of}} general {{jurisdiction}} in the State of Alabama. <b>The</b> <b>Circuit</b> <b>Courts</b> have jurisdiction to hear {{civil and criminal}} cases.

5000|$|By rule, each of <b>the</b> <b>Circuit</b> <b>Courts</b> is {{required}} to have a differentiated case management plan “for the prompt and efficient scheduling and disposition of actions.” [...] Such plans vary by jurisdiction, but include the classification of cases by complexity and priority, to be assigned to particular scheduling “tracks” based on that classification. [...] Consistent with applicable <b>court</b> rule, <b>the</b> <b>Circuit</b> <b>Courts</b> have endeavored to make their differentiated case management plans as similar as possible; in practice, however, the plans do vary somewhat among <b>the</b> <b>Circuit</b> <b>Courts.</b>|$|R
5|$|Citizens of Virginia Beach also elect five {{constitutional}} officers, {{and candidates}} for these offices {{are permitted to}} run with an affiliated political party.

5|$|In United States v. Hamilton (1883), the Court reaffirmed {{its earlier}} {{holdings}} that certificates could not issue from motions to quash an indictment. And, in United States v.

5|$|The Supreme Court granted certiorari in January 1987, and {{the case}} was argued on October 13, 1987.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Circuit</b> <b>Courts</b> of Maryland are {{the state}} trial courts of general {{jurisdiction}} in Maryland. They are Maryland's highest courts of record exercising original jurisdiction at law and in equity in all {{civil and criminal}} matters, and have such additional powers and jurisdiction as conferred by the Maryland Constitution of 1867 as amended, or by law. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Circuit</b> <b>Courts</b> also preside over divorce and most family law matters.

500|$|The {{second of}} forty-one {{criminal}} cases {{heard by the}} Marshall Court, More ensured that the Court's criminal jurisprudence {{would be limited to}} writs of error from the state (and later, territorial) courts, original habeas petitions and writs of error from habeas petitions in <b>the</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>courts,</b> and certificates of division and mandamus from <b>the</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>courts.</b> Congress did not grant the Court jurisdiction to hear writs of error from <b>the</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>courts</b> in criminal cases until 1889, for capital crimes, and 1891, for other [...] "infamous" [...] crimes. The Judicial Code of 1911 abolished <b>the</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>courts,</b> transferred <b>the</b> trial of crimes to the district courts, and extended the Court's appellate jurisdiction to all crimes. But, these statutory grants were construed not to permit writs of error filed by the prosecution, as in More.|$|R
5|$|The {{first two}} years of Garrard's second term were {{relatively}} uneventful, but in the 1802 General Assembly, legislators approved two bills related to <b>the</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>court</b> system that Garrard vetoed. The first bill expanded the number of courts and provided that untrained citizens could sit as judges in the court system. Garrard questioned the cost of the additional courts and the wisdom of allowing untrained judges on the bench; he also objected to the bill's circumvention of the governor's authority to appoint judges. The second bill allowed attorneys and judges in <b>the</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>court</b> system to reside outside the districts they served. The General Assembly overrode Garrard's second veto, marking the first time in Kentucky history that a gubernatorial veto was overridden and the only time during Garrard's eight-year tenure.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecutors}} {{assigned to}} the case were originally Assistant United States Attorneys Steven Block and Carrie Hamilton.

5|$|When Dowling's {{attorneys}} {{learned about}} the retainer to DLA Piper they {{asked the court to}} order the return of the retainer to the plaintiff, and <b>the</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>court</b> ruled in favor of Dowling. On appeal, the decision was upheld. The Illinois Supreme Court reversed the circuit-court decision, ruling that the retainer was the property of DLA Piper and not Dowling.|$|E
50|$|Lower {{courts are}} bound by the {{precedent}} set by higher courts within their region. Thus, a federal district court that falls within the geographic boundaries of <b>the</b> Third <b>Circuit</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeals (<b>the</b> mid-level appeals court that hears appeals from district court decisions from Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and the Virgin Islands) is bound by rulings of <b>the</b> Third <b>Circuit</b> <b>Court,</b> but not by rulings in <b>the</b> Ninth <b>Circuit</b> (Alaska, Arizona, California, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Northern Mariana Islands, Oregon, and Washington), since <b>the</b> <b>Circuit</b> <b>Courts</b> of Appeals have jurisdiction defined by geography. <b>The</b> <b>Circuit</b> <b>Courts</b> of Appeals can interpret the law how they want, {{so long as there}} is no binding Supreme Court precedent. One of the common reasons the Supreme Court grants certiorari (that is, they agree to hear a case) is if there is a conflict among <b>the</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>courts</b> as to <b>the</b> meaning of a federal law.|$|R

5|$|Emanuel's {{eligibility}} for office was challenged {{on the basis}} of his lack of residency in Chicago for one year prior to the election. The Board of Elections and the Cook County Circuit Court affirmed his eligibility. A divided Court of Appeals reversed <b>the</b> <b>Circuit</b> <b>Court,</b> holding on January 24, 2011, that residency for purposes of a candidate is different from residency for purposes of being a voter. A further appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court resulted in a unanimous decision reversing the Court of Appeals and affirming Emanuel's eligibility.|$|E
5|$|Hastings {{began to}} study law with Charles Thorpe, Esq., of Norwich. After {{a few months of}} study, he decided to move to Lawrenceburg, Indiana. He {{completed}} his legal studies there with Daniel S. Majors, Esq. He did not immediately enter the practice of law and instead became an editor of the Indiana Signal, where he supported Martin Van Buren in his presidential campaign. He moved to Terre Haute, Indiana, in December 1836 and underwent a legal examination by Judge Porters of <b>the</b> <b>Circuit</b> <b>Court.</b>|$|E

50|$|In 1911, the United States Congress {{created a}} single code {{encompassing}} all statutes {{related to the}} judiciary and {{took the opportunity to}} revise and unify existing laws. At the same time, Congress abolished <b>the</b> U.S. <b>circuit</b> <b>courts</b> as of January 1, 1912, the effective date of the statute. Established by the Judiciary Act of 1789, <b>the</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>courts</b> served as <b>the</b> most important trial courts of the federal judiciary for over a century. <b>The</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>courts</b> lost their limited appellate jurisdiction in the Judiciary Act of 1891, which created the U.S. courts of appeals, but as part of the political compromise behind the 1891 Act, <b>the</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>courts</b> continued to serve as trial courts alongside the district courts for the next 20 years. By abolishing <b>the</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>courts</b> and transferring their jurisdiction and pending business to the district courts, Congress instituted a judicial system with a single type of trial court and eliminated the inefficiencies associated with administering two types of court that were often presided over by the same judge.|$|R
