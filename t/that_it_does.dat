5|$|Lower {{courts are}} split {{on whether the}} Clause {{requires}} that the defendant be tried in a judicial district that was in existence {{at the time the}} crime was committed. Some courts have held <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does.</b> Others have held <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not and that the district need only be ascertained prior to trial. Even proponents of the former view have found no infirmity when Congress prospectively divides a judicial district, but retains the former configuration for past offenses.|$|E
5|$|After {{claims in}} the media that the hashtags #wikileaks and #occupywallstreet were being censored {{because they did not}} show up on the site's list of {{trending}} topics, Twitter responded by stating <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not censor hashtags unless they contain obscenities.|$|E

5|$|Some of Churchill's Native American critics, such as Vernon Bellecourt (White Earth Ojibwe) and Suzan Shown Harjo (Southern Cheyenne-Muscogee Creek), {{argue that}} his {{assertion}} of Native American ancestry without {{the ability to}} prove it might constitute misrepresentation and grounds for termination. The University has said <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not hire {{on the basis of}} ethnicity.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{criticisms of the}} three-tiered {{scrutiny}} analysis, the most compelling reason against its adoption arguably being <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not control judicial discretion: the identification of classifications as suspect, quasi-suspect or non-suspect involves unconstrained balancing {{of public and private}} interests, and political and social interests.|$|E
5|$|A {{road from}} New Albany to north of Center Village first {{appeared}} on maps in 1924. In 1929, the road was extended to connect to Condit. SR 605 was designated in 1937, following the alignment from US 62, to a junction with the US 36/SR 3 concurrency in Condit. By 1994, jurisdiction of the portion of SR 605 between SR 37 and the US 36/SR 3 concurrency was transferred from the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) to Delaware County, who renamed the road to County Road 605. As {{a result of this}} move, SR 605 took on the routing <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> today.|$|E
5|$|A {{somewhat}} different design of cutting tool that can achieve the irregular hole or outer {{profile of a}} broach is called a rotary broach or wobble broach. One of the biggest advantages {{to this type of}} broaching is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not require a broaching machine, but instead is used on lathes, milling machines, screw machines or Swiss lathes.|$|E

5|$|In modern versions, Caerphilly {{cheese is}} used, {{which is a}} {{descendant}} of the old traditional Glamorgan cheese recipe and lends the same general texture and flavour. The basic recipe calls for a mixture of cheese, leeks and breadcrumbs, although some recipes swap the leeks for onions or spring onions and may add herbs such as parsley or further flavourings such as mustard. The mixture is then rolled into sausage shapes, and then fried. There is no sausage casing used, although egg is used to bind the mixture so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not fall apart during the cooking process.|$|E

5|$|Since 2012, Federal Cartridge Company {{produces}} a 5.7×28mm round under their American Eagle brand. Designated the AE5728A, this cartridge uses a 40-grain total metal jacket (TMJ) projectile, that is atypical in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> {{not use a}} copper plated bullet; sectioned pictures show a very thick full copper jacket. The AE5728A casings are of FN manufacture, and the muzzle velocity is slightly {{lower than that of}} the SS197SR.|$|E
5|$|The Ramayana further adds: Kabandha {{spent his}} days near the hermitage of the sage Matanga in the Krauncha forest. There, he spent his time scaring sages. Once, Kabandha {{attacked}} the sage Stulashira, who cursed him to remain in his hideous form for eternity. Upon Kabandha's pleading, the sage reduced his curse and said that Kabandha would be freed of his form, once Rama and Lakshmana sever his arms. So Kabandha waited in that forest for Rama's arrival. Growse suspected the tale to be a later interpolation arguing <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not appear in all versions/translations of the original Ramayana.|$|E

5|$|The amendment's {{first section}} {{includes}} several clauses: the Citizenship Clause, Privileges or Immunities Clause, Due Process Clause, and Equal Protection Clause. The Citizenship Clause provides a broad definition of citizenship, nullifying the Supreme Court's decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), which had held that Americans descended from African slaves {{could not be}} citizens of the United States. The Privileges or Immunities Clause has been interpreted {{in such a way}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> very little.|$|E
5|$|The {{calendar}} for the ELCA {{is similar}} to many other Western Calendars in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not commemorate any persons from the Old Testament. The calendars of the Orthodox Churches have Old Testament individuals, and the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod has done the same. At one point there was a proposal to include {{a day on the}} Episcopal Church calendar (which was taken into consideration by the Inter-Lutheran Commission on Worship in developing the Lutheran Book of Worship) for Old Testament saints following the octave of All Saints (November 8), but this idea was ultimately rejected as tokenism.|$|E

Although it is considered a violation of such laws for companies to agree to divide up geographic territories {{for the sale of}} goods, concurrent use agreements dividing up trademark territories are specifically provided for by Congress. Furthermore, even with such an agreement in place, a company can still sell competing products in the trademark territory of another company, so long as the intruding party sells that product under a different mark.|$|E
