40|$|Cost, size, speed, and {{measurement}} range limitations make the resistance bridge not always suitable for temperature measurements with platinum resistance thermometers (PRTs) in industrial applications. However, high-accuracy resistance thermometer systems are often needed in many industrial applications, where measurement performances comparable to resistance bridges are often needed {{at a lower}} cost and size. A tiny, portable, ratiometric front-end exploiting a 24 -bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with Σ Δ modulator is described. It was designed to measure the resistance ratio between a 100 Ω industrial PRT (IPRT) and a reference resistor with repeatability to within a few parts in 106. Its small size makes it ideal for integration in the stem-handle assembly of a thermometric probe, enabling an early transmission of measurement data in digital form. The ADC-based system design, development, and performance testing are discussed. The system was investigated in the resistance ratio range from about 4 × 10 - 3 to 5 × 10 - 2. Furthermore, a comparison between the system performance and a commercial AC resistance bridge was carried out and the results reported in this paper. An accurate thermometer for industrial applications resulted from the above developments. The compactness of the devices enabled an implementation of the `smart sensor' concept in the measurement chain, where the front-end electronics was placed inside the IPRT handle together with an integrated memory <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>device</b> identification, calibration coefficients, and the associated uncertainty. All data are transmitted to the readout module and are available to the user at a 5 Hz update rate for further analysis...|$|E

30|$|We {{also wanted}} to allow users to use the {{technique}} while looking directly at the large display, without having {{to look at the}} device. During presentations, the presenter’s gaze guides the audience and if the presenter were to look at his device screen to manipulate it would create a disconnect with the audience. This also allows the presenter to interact in a natural standing pose, with their arms resting by their torso while the device is supported by both hands. <b>Holding</b> the <b>device</b> near the torso was a key design point for fatigue-free interaction. In contrast, many wand or gesture-based techniques require the user <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the <b>device</b> with the arms extended, which induces fatigue.

As an example, the standard error of the NIR model for N of PM fresh samples, was only twice to three-folds those reported for models developed with finely homogenized (ground, dried) samples. Even done on a small set, direct "on farm" characterization of PM with a portable apparatus after a rough homogenization of the samples showed promising performance.

40|$|Abstract. Biomimetic is {{the field}} of {{engineering}} in which biological creatures and their functions are investigated and are {{used as the basis}} for the design and manufacturing of machines. Ionic Polymer Metal Composite (IPMC) is a smart material which has demonstrated a meaningful bending and tip force after the application of a low voltage. It is light-weighted, flexible, easily actuated, multi-directional applicable and requires simple manufacturing. Resultantly, IPMC has attracted scientists and researchers to analyze it further and consider it for any industrial and biomimetic applications. Presently, the research on IPMC is bi-directional oriented. A few groups of researchers are busy to find out the causes for the weaknesses of the material and to find out any remedy for them. The second class of scientists is exploring new areas of applications where IPMC material can be used. Although, the application zone of IPMC is ranging from micropumps diaphragms <b>to</b> surgical <b>holding</b> <b>devices,</b> this paper provides an overview of the IPMC application in biomimetic and biomedical field. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes an {{audio-visual}} {{speech recognition}} method using lip movement extracted from side-face images {{to attempt to}} increase noise-robustness in mobile environments. Although most previous bimodal speech recognition methods use frontal face (lip) images, these methods are not easy for users since they need <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> a <b>device</b> with a camera {{in front of their}} face when talking. Our proposed method capturing lip movement using a small camera installed in a handset is more natural, easy and convenient. This method also effectively avoids a decrease of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of input speech. Visual features are extracted by optical-flow analysis and combined with audio features in the framework of HMM-based recognition. Phone HMMs are built by the multi-stream HMM technique. Experiments conducted using Japanese connected digit speech contaminated with white noise in various SNR conditions show effectiveness of the proposed method. Recognition accuracy is improved by using the visual information in all SNR conditions, and the best improvement is approximately 6 % at 5 dB SNR. 1...|$|R
