5|$|The radar {{contacts}} were, in fact, {{the approaching}} 31 Japanese torpedo bombers, who circled {{around to the}} south of TF18 so that they could attack from the east, with the black backdrop of <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>sky</b> behind them. From this direction, the Japanese bombers were hidden by the night sky, but Giffen's ships were silhouetted against the twilight of the western horizon. The 705AG aircraft attacked first, beginning at 19:19. Nakamura's aircraft missed with all of their torpedoes and one was shot down by anti-aircraft fire from Giffen's ships.|$|E
25|$|According to a legend, {{on a day}} in {{the year}} 834, the monk Sanshū, on a meditative walk along the western shore of Lake Biwa, would have seen purple clouds in <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>sky</b> across the lake. A {{dazzling}} light suddenly appeared. The monk, interpreting this phenomenon as a sign of celestial power, went to the spot where the brilliance of light had formed. There he found a pond on which he began to pray.|$|E
25|$|At 15:48, {{with the}} {{opposing}} forces roughly parallel at , with the British to the south-west of the Germans (i.e., {{on the right}} side), Hipper opened fire, followed by the British ships as their guns came to bear upon targets (position 2). Thus began the opening phase of the battlecruiser action, known as the Run to the South, in which the British chased the Germans, and Hipper intentionally led Beatty toward Scheer. During the first minutes of the ensuing battle, all the British ships except Princess Royal fired far over their German opponents, due to adverse visibility conditions, before finally getting the range. Only Lion and Princess Royal had settled into formation, so the other four ships were hampered in aiming by their own turning. Beatty was to windward of Hipper, and therefore funnel and gun smoke from his own ships tended to obscure his targets, while Hipper's smoke blew clear. Also, <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>sky</b> was overcast and the grey German ships were indistinct and difficult to range.|$|E

2500|$|Amongst {{the papers}} {{captured}} on the Abbas was the cipher key Gordon used to code his messages {{in and out}} of Khartoum, which meant he could no longer read the messages he received, leading him to write in his diary: [...] "I think cipher-messages are in some countries, like this, a mistake". During this period, Gordon was lionized by the British press, which portrayed him as a latter-day Christian [...] "knight", a [...] "crusader" [...] and a [...] "saint", a man of pure good, heroically battling the Mahdi, who was depicted as a man of pure evil. The Pall Mall Gazette in a front page leader wrote that Gordon stood [...] "out in clear relief against <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>sky.</b> Alone in a black continent, dauntless and unfaltering, he discharges his great trust, holding the capital of the Sudan against the beleaguering hordes". The defenses Gordon had built with lines of earthwork, mines, and barbed wire presented the Ansar with much difficulty and their attempts to storm Khartoum failed, but the Ansar made good use of their Krupp artillery to gradually batter down the defenses. To counter Gordon's armored streamers, the Mahdi built a series of forts along the Nile equipped with Krupp guns that over time proceeded to make it almost impossible for Gordon's navy to operate.|$|E
