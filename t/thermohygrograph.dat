40|$|For all {{our concern}} about the damage caused to art by the environment, there are no data which allow us to connect {{measured}} environmental variables with the rate of deterioration of the art in exhibition or storage. Recent proposals for rating the suitability of spaces and the vulnerability of individual objects require a durability of electronic data which is very unlikely to be achieved. This is {{a review of the}} state of the art of recording the environment around art. Figure 1 : The human readability of analog records produced by thermohygrographs gives many advantages. For quality control, rather than research, the <b>thermohygrograph</b> still has a role to play in museums...|$|E
40|$|Microclimate {{research}} of the Cave in Belejska komunada was conducted in the period from 1 February to 19 August 2007. In the analysis of temperature and air humidity measurement data recorded by electronic <b>thermohygrograph</b> were used. Measurement points were installed {{in the vicinity of}} the entrance and at the bottom of the cave. The research was carried out as a component of the geoecological evaluation of the cave for the purpose of planning its tourist use. The measurement was conducted during the warm part of the year when the majority of tourists would visit, therefore the period was particularly interesting since the cave visitors have an impact on changes in microclimatic parameters...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study Hedypathes betulinus behavior on erva-mate. Observations were conducted in a homogeneous eight years-old erva-mate population under 1. 5 m x 2. 0 m spacing layout in 15 ha and 20 ha fields in both Ilópolis, State of Rio Grande do Sul and Catanduvas, State of Santa Catarina, respectively. The observations were conducted hourly during six days, totalizing 144 observations in Ilópolis (RS) and three days, totalizing 72 observations in Catanduvas (SC), February and March, 2001, respectively. The environmental factors temperature (°C), relative humidity (%), wind speed (m/s) and light intensity (Klux) were evaluated using a <b>thermohygrograph,</b> an anemometer and a luximeter. The behavioral aspects observed were mating, oviposition, feeding, male keeping female, standing alone insect and insect in movement. Oviposition and feeding were the only behaviors affected by the periods {{of the day and}} environmental conditions. Considering other behaviors, Hedypathes betulinus presents no preference in relation to the periods or hours of the day they occur. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{meteorological}} observation of indoor air-temperatures and humidities of Omotegura (Dozo style old treasury) and Kyozo (wooden old treasury) in Koyasan {{was made by}} the aid of <b>thermohygrographs</b> and an Assman's aspiration psychrometer for the period extending from 1972 to 1974. The data show that Omotegura has the annual mean values of 9. 5 ゜C in temperature and 8 O% in humidity, and Kyozo has those of 9. 2 ゜C and 84 %. And these two treasuries have also the values of about 22 ゜C and 11 % in annual ranges of air-temperature and humidity...|$|R

40|$|The {{internship}} {{requirements for}} Master of Applied Science in Materials Conservation were {{completed in the}} Materials Conservation laboratory of the Australian Museum {{under the direction of}} Miss Sue Walston between November 30 th, 1981 and July 9 th, 1982. The work programme focused upon the preparation of artefacts for a permanent gallery display entitled "The Abelam, a people of Papua New Guinea". Wooden carvings, shell ornaments, bone implements, ceramic and coconut bowls, and wooden spears were the most common artefact types requiring treatment, prior to display. Many objects were decorated with pigments, shells, beads or feathers and were secured with plied fibre string. Artefacts were photographed, condition and proposed treatment reports were written, practical work was carried out and final treatment reports were finished. Upon completion of the gallery, the Materials Conservation laboratory staff reviewed their role in the overall gallery plan. As a group, the problems affecting the conservation and display of artefacts were identified and analysed. A flow chart of exhibition guidelines for Materials Conservation was prepared for use when planning future galleries. The relative humidity and temperature were monitored regularly in various areas throughout the museum. Accurate readings were obtained using a sling psychrometer and <b>thermohygrographs.</b> Each week the modes of the relative humidity charts were calculated, analysed and recorded. While treating objects for the Abelarn gallery, the need for specifically coloured support materials became evident. Dye types capable of permanently colouring a diverse range of cellulosic materials were investigated. Trichromatic colour cards were prepared for each material. A flood occurred in the Aboriginal gallery which required immediate action by the conservation staff. Affected artefacts were transported to the laboratory, stabilized and reports on their condition were written. A workshop on microscopic examination of cellulosic materials was organized by Mary-Lou Florian, Conservation Scientist with the British Columbia Provincial Museum, Canada. She also gave a lecture at the Forestry Commission of N. S. W. on Conservation of Aboriginal carved trees and Canadian totem poles. Dr. P. Casey presented information on fungi to the Australian Museum Conservation staff. A technical meeting on the topic of interlaboratory co-operation was attended at the conservation unit of the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences. The conservation facility at the Art Gallery of N. S. W. and the Nickleson Museum, University of Sydney, were viewed...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} was to study the leaf temperature (LT) and leaf diffusive vapor conductance (gs) responses to temperature, humidity and incident flux density of photosynthetically active photons (PPFD) of tomato plants grown without water restriction in a plastic greenhouse in Santa Maria, RS, Brazil. The plants were grown in substrate and irrigated daily. The gs was measured using a steady-state null-balance porometer on the abaxial face of the leaves during the daytime. Both leaf surfaces were measured in one day. The PPFD and LT were measured using the porometer. Leaf temperature was determined using an infrared thermometer, and air temperature and humidity were measured using a <b>thermohygrograph.</b> The leaves on the upper layer of the plants had higher gs than the lower layer. The relationship between the gs and PPFD was different for the two layers in the plants. A consistent relationship between the gs and atmospheric water demand was observed only in the lower layer. The LT tended to be lower than the air temperature. The mean value for the gs was 2. 88 times higher on the abaxial than adaxial leaf surface. Key words: controlled environment, stomatal behavior, air vapor pressure deficit, leaf-to-air vapor pressure defici...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the physiological behavior {{at different times of}} the day and the level of dependence between physiological variables and meteorological elements in Aleurites fordii seedlings. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse, using a completely randomized experimental design, in a uniform scheme composed of 10 evaluation times (from 8 am to 5 pm, with an interval of 1 h between evaluations) and three replications. Each replicate consisted of three evaluation plants, totaling nine seedlings, which were arranged on a double border. The following characteristics were evaluated: leaf temperature (ºC), photosynthetically active solar radiation ((mol S- 1 m- 2), stomatal resistance (S cm- 1), and transpiration (mmol H 2 O s- 1 m- 2) over a typical day, using a LI- 1600 LI-COR digital porometer. The temperature and relative humidity were measured inside the greenhouse, using a <b>thermohygrograph.</b> The evaluations were performed at 244 days after sowing, between 8 : 00 and 17 : 00, with an interval of 60 minutes, totaling 10 evaluations. The physiological changes of Aleurites fordii seedlings are affected by the time of day. In general, the physiological variables are highly dependent on meteorological elements. The temperature of the greenhouse and the relative humidity are the meteorological elements that most influence the physiological behavior of Aleurites fordii seedlings...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the post–embryonic development of Chrysomya putoria (Wiedemann 1818) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) reared on a diet of gizzard or gizzard/agar homogenate, with a diet of beef used as the control. Four replicates per treatment were performed (60 mL of each diet). The gizzard (60 %), distilled water, and agar homogenate were combined in a blender. Each replicate consisted of 40 newly hatched larvae of C. putoria (5 th generation). Each glass beaker containing a diet was inserted into a larger flask containing sawdust, which was covered with a nylon cloth held in place by an elastic band. The larvae were weighed and stored in test tubes sealed with a nylon cloth and an elastic band. The average temperature, measured with a <b>thermohygrograph,</b> was 20. 6 °C, and the average relative humidity was 67. 7 %. The variation in the mean weight of mature larvae and in the duration of the larval, pupal, and total stages (newly hatched larvae to imagoes) were analyzed by Student’s t–test (α = 5 %), while viability was compared by ANOVA. The sex ratio was evaluated by the chi–squared test. The average duration of the period from the larval to imago stage was 8. 868 days on the beef diet, 8. 676 on the gizzard diet, and 9. 067 on the gizzard/agar homogenate diet. Larval survival rates o...|$|E
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] The aim of {{the study}} was to seek for a {{possible}} association between the incidence of upper respiratory tract infections and air temperature and humidity in the home. DESIGN [...] Recordings of temperature and relative humidity were made in living rooms and children's bedrooms over a six month period and related to incidence of upper respiratory tract infection. SETTING [...] The study was carried out in one general practice of 10, 000 patients. PATIENTS [...] 297 children aged 24 - 59 months were studied, selected in random order from the practice age-sex register. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] Temperature and humidity recordings were made with <b>thermohygrograph</b> recorders over six days. Upper respiratory tract infections were recorded (a) retrospectively over the previous 12 months, and (b) during the study period. Past history of acute otitis media and recent family history of respiratory infection were also obtained. No significant association was found between the variables, although the bedrooms of children with reported upper respiratory tract infections were cooler overnight than those of non-infected children (mean difference 0. 8 degrees C, 95 % confidence limits 0. 7 degrees C). No association was found between reported or recorded upper respiratory tract infections and age or type of home, family size, level of occupancy, social class, or smoking habits. Only 15 children (5 %) were identified by their parents as having had asthma, but 58 (19. 5 %) had had a "wheezy chest". A greater proportion of children who wheezed slept in cooler bedrooms, had gas fires rather than central heating, and had more smokers in the house. CONCLUSIONS [...] No association between upper respiratory tract infection and domestic temperature or humidity levels could be shown in this study. Since dampness is repeatedly presented as a health risk, further study is required...|$|E
