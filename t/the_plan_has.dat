5|$|Paul Schneider as Mark Brendanawicz, a {{city planner}} with the Pawnee {{municipal}} government. He {{has long been}} disillusioned with government after being unable to achieve his career ambitions. Leslie harbors a strong crush on Mark due to a romantic encounter they had several years ago, but Mark does not return her feelings. Mark assists Leslie with her plan to turn the pit next to Ann's house into a park, despite believing that <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>has</b> no chance of success.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>has</b> been criticised by {{environmental}} associations and some local Sicilians and Calabrians, concerned with its environmental impact, economical sustainability and even possible infiltrations by organised crime.|$|E
25|$|A {{plan was}} {{announced}} in 2015 to allow all passengers to transit without a visa through the Vancouver International Airport. As of March 2017, <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>has</b> not been implemented.|$|E

25|$|In January 2009, Governor Palin {{introduced}} a new plan that would convert 50% of Alaska's energy resources to renewables. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>has</b> been hailed by some environmental activists as the most ambitious alternative energy project in the country.|$|E
25|$|In November 2007, Australian mining firm Frontier Resources {{announced}} plans to divert {{a section of the}} track {{to make way for a}} copper mine. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>has</b> the support of the local landowners and the Papua New Guinean government but has been criticized by trekking operators.|$|E
25|$|Another plan {{recently}} discussed is extending Interstate 565 {{west from}} its current terminus just outside Decatur, perhaps along Alabama 20/Alternate U.S. 72. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>has</b> received some support from Decatur officials, some of whom {{would like to see}} the Interstate eventually extend west of Decatur and at least into Lawrence County.|$|E

25|$|Tourism {{plays an}} {{increasing}} {{role in the}} island's economy. The Panglao Island International Airport is currently planned for Panglao, which houses the most-visited and accessible beaches in the province. Proponents of the scheme hope that the new airport will increase Bohol's reputation as an international tourist destination although <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>has</b> been dogged by ongoing criticism.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} much {{controversy}} over a large three-phase project that is due at Union Station. The plan calls for new parking garages, office space, more space in Union Station to be opened for retail and restaurants, and apartments. Currently, <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>has</b> had some problems, as {{there are not enough}} funds for this project to take place.|$|E
25|$|The plan emphasises {{speed and}} {{overwhelming}} firepower: armored formations and accompanying infantry would advance into eastern Pakistan with limited goals {{in terms of}} distance {{and in terms of}} duration. The plan reportedly has a significant air support component. From the Indian perspective, <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>has</b> the added virtue of accentuating Pakistani discomfiture and angst, which in theory may have some deterrent value.|$|E
5000|$|Those advocating {{suspension}} or {{cancellation of}} <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>have</b> often quoted {{one or more}} of these arguments: ...|$|R
25|$|Costs of {{continuing}} <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>have</b> become unreasonably burdensome {{solely because of}} {{a decline in the}} employer's workforce.|$|R

25|$|Due to the city's acute gridlock, the Jakarta {{administration}} {{has decided to}} implement electronic toll collection in 10 districts: Tanah Abang, Menteng, Setiabudi, Tebet, Matraman, Senen, Gambir, Tambora, Sawah Besar and Taman Sari. The ERP was planned to be implemented in the three-in-one zone and along Jl. Rasuna Said in Kuningan by {{the first quarter of}} 2014, although by September 2016 <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>has</b> not started. Vehicles passing through the ERP areas will be charged Rp 21,072.|$|E
25|$|According to Ardenti's theory, {{after the}} French monarchy and the Catholic Church disbanded the Templars {{on the grounds}} of heresy, some knights escaped and {{established}} cells throughout the world. These cells have been meeting at regular intervals in distinct places to pass on information about the Grail. Ultimately, these cells will reunite to rediscover the Grail's location and achieve world domination. According to Ardenti's calculations, the Templars should have taken over the world in 1944; evidently <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>has</b> been interrupted.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>has</b> two value chains {{to produce}} pulp. The first is {{thermomechanical}} process, which is fed chippings directly from external sources, {{as well as}} on-side chopping of lumber. The bark from the lumber is extracted and used in as on-site heating. The second source of pulp is from recycled paper, sourced both domestically and through import. The recycled paper goes through a deinking process before becoming usable deinkled pulp (DIP). A small portion of calcium carbonate {{is added to the}} pulp before processing.|$|E

25|$|Green dealt {{only with}} the plan for invasion, as no details on any subjugation of the {{population}} and eventual conquest of the entire island were included. Among the Irish population, however, there was an element of support for the Third Reich due to resentment of British rule. Sketchiness with regards to <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>has</b> contributed to an assessment that it was more a diversionary attack than actual attempt to take over the island, although once committed it may have been hard for the German forces to withdraw.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{investment}} {{was to create}} approximately 100,000 jobs. The stated reason for the decision is a $21.3 billion deficit in the 2010 provincial operating budget. Standard economic metrics, however, show that as stimulus, Transit City adds significantly to provincial tax revenues, and given the province's 50-year amortization, the plan overall reduces Ontario's annual budget deficit. This caused widespread debate, protests and criticism of premier Dalton McGuinty by politicians and local groups. As {{a result of the}} postponement, <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>has</b> since been scaled down and expected completion dates have been further pushed back.|$|E
25|$|The State Capitol {{is largely}} {{surrounded}} by state government buildings. The parks, walking trails, and monuments {{on the grounds}} give visitors information about the state's history, {{making it one of}} the city's tourist attractions. Six buildings exist on the grounds; all built during various time periods as the government grew. Not all state agencies are housed on the grounds, however: a large number are spread throughout the city in various facilities. Plans for a massive expansion and improvement of the grounds were developed in 2000, but very little of <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>has</b> been implemented as of 2012.|$|E
