5|$|Soon {{thereafter}} came {{new evidence}} on dinosaur social behavior, with nests of Maiasaura suggesting parental care. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> were {{reflected in the}} work {{of a new generation of}} paleoartists. One milestone was Sarah Landry's feathered dinosaur in Bakker's 1975 Scientific American article, Dinosaur Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|<b>These</b> <b>findings</b> are contested by Warnicke {{in several}} books and articles, and the {{evidence}} does not conclusively support either date.|$|E
30|$|However, current {{observations}} {{are based on}} (single-centre) studies with heterogeneous study designs and limited populations. Thus, <b>these</b> <b>finding</b> should be interpreted with these limitations in mind.|$|R
50|$|<b>These</b> <b>finding</b> further {{strengthened}} {{the conviction that}} Israel does suffer from a problem of concentration and pushed to Concentration Committee, which was yet to publish its interim report, to follow suit.|$|R
30|$|The primary {{finding of}} this study was that {{augmented}} EMG activity was observed during VH exercise, which was accompanied by muscle deoxygenation. <b>These</b> <b>finding</b> supports our hypothesis that VH during exercise enhances EMG responses.|$|R
5|$|A {{study in}} 1993 by Segawa et al. {{revealed}} that the population of S.lessoniana in Okinawa may actually be composed of three distinct species. This was confirmed in genetic studies by Izuka et al. in 1994. Triantafillos and Adams in 2005 also showed that S.lessoniana in Shark Bay, Australia is composed of two species. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> indicate that S.lessoniana may actually comprise several very similar and closely related species. It is now believed that S.lessoniana is a cryptic species complex.|$|E
5|$|Around {{one-third of}} people with {{psoriasis}} report {{a family history of}} the disease, and researchers have identified genetic loci associated with the condition. Identical twin studies suggest a 70% chance of a twin developing psoriasis if the other twin has the disorder. The risk is around 20% for nonidentical twins. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> suggest both a genetic susceptibility and an environmental response in developing psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|CTW {{conducted}} research in two ways: in-house formative research that informed and improved production, and independent summative evaluations {{conducted by the}} Educational Testing Service (ETS) during the show's first two seasons to measure the program's educational effectiveness. CTW researchers invented tools to measure young viewers' attention to the program. Based on <b>these</b> <b>findings,</b> the researchers compiled a body of data and the producers changed the show accordingly. The formative research on Sesame Street {{was the first time}} children's television viewing was studied scientifically.|$|E
50|$|<b>These</b> <b>finding</b> scenes can be {{identified}} several times throughout the epic including when Telemachus and Pisistratus find Menelaus when Calypso finds Odysseus on the beach, and when the suitor Amphimedon finds Agamemnon in Hades.|$|R
50|$|Remarkably, {{one-third of}} swingers flatly {{rejected}} the idea of changing their behaviors in response to HIV/AIDS. <b>These</b> <b>finding</b> suggest people involved in open marriages may indeed be at somewhat greater risk of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS.|$|R
30|$|Discussion: Essure 505 was {{successful}} at causing tubal occlusion within one hour post-placement {{as well as}} at 30, 60 and 90 days later. <b>These</b> <b>finding</b> suggest next generation Essure 505 will provide immediate and long term tubal occlusion.|$|R
5|$|However, , {{with the}} {{exception}} of Spiroplasma mirum strain SMCA causing spongiform microcystic encephalitis in suckling rats, other researchers have been unable to duplicate <b>these</b> <b>findings,</b> casting doubt on the Spiroplasma hypothesis. In defense of the Spiroplasma hypothesis, Bastian pointed out that Spiroplasma is hard to culture and that strain variation makes it hard to detect certain strains using PCR and other techniques, thus giving a false negative.|$|E
5|$|However, Psittacosaurus may {{not have}} been entirely bipedal for its entire lifespan. Taking {{sections}} from the limb bones of 16 specimens of Psittacosaurus, ranging in age from less than a year old to ten-year old adults, Qi Zhao from the University of Bristol found that Psittacosaurus was probably secondarily bipedal. The infants' front limbs grew at faster rates than the hind limbs at between birth and three years of age. At the age of between four and six years, arm growth slowed and leg growth accelerated as the animal became mature. At this stage, Psittacosaurs would switch to a bipedal stance. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> further reveal that the ancestor of Psittacosaurus was likely quadrupedal and eventually gained the ability to become bipedal as it evolved, with the young retaining the quadrupedal gait of the ancestor in question. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> also lead to the hypothesis that many such dinosaur families may have evolved along this path {{at some point in their}} evolution.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Singh and {{his colleagues}} {{discovered}} that a tiny portion of the short arm of sex-determining Y chromosome was necessary and sufficient to convert a female mouse to male. This fundamental discovery provided a new concept of Chromosomal translocation of sex-determining region from Y chromosome to X chromosomes causing sex reversal in mice. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> later became {{the foundation for the}} discovery of a similar phenomenon of sex reversal in humans.|$|E
30|$|The {{highest number}} of flower buds per plant and the {{highest number of}} flowers per plant were {{resulted}} with blue laser radiation for 20  min. <b>These</b> <b>finding</b> were in agreement with El-Tobgy et al. (2009) and Osman et al. (2009).|$|R
30|$|The above studies clearly {{indicate}} a powerful therapeutic capacity of targeting TAZ in human cancer. Further {{investigation of the}} regulation and function of TAZ will help us to uncover the mystery of this amazing protein and apply <b>these</b> <b>finding</b> to cancer therapy.|$|R
30|$|However, <b>these</b> <b>finding</b> are {{predicted}} {{to lose the}} effectiveness in the next decades due to development and transition of the world market, from activity based on industry and goods to activity based on services and knowledge (according to IPCC-B 1 scenario, 1992).|$|R
5|$|In May 2017, {{evidence}} of the earliest known life on land on Earth may {{have been found in}} 3.48-billion-year-old geyserite and other related mineral deposits (often found around hot springs and geysers) uncovered in the Pilbara Craton of Western Australia. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> may be helpful in deciding where best to search for early signs of life on the planet Mars.|$|E
5|$|In {{a series}} of 500 {{consecutive}} obstetric patients, Boisvert and Hudon observed vomiting in 12 (4.8%) patients during or after administration of methoxyflurane anesthesia. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> compared favorably with those reported for cyclopropane (42%), trichloroethylene (28%) and halothane (4.6%). In another study of 645 obstetric patients, Romagnoli and Korman observed 8 cases (1.2%) of postoperative vomiting, {{one of whom was}} retching before the administration of the anesthetic.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory (brown) rats {{may have}} the {{capacity}} for metacognition—to consider their own learning and then {{make decisions based on}} what they know, or do not know, as indicated by choices they make apparently trading off difficulty of tasks and expected rewards, making them the first animals other than primates to have this capacity, but <b>these</b> <b>findings</b> are disputed, since the rats may have been following simple operant conditioning principles, or a behavioral economic model.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} shown that S100A11 enhances the {{recombination}} activity of human RAD51 in vitro. A knock-down leads to diffuse distribution of RAD54B.

30|$|The study {{suggests}} that complicated unsaturated seepage behavior can be easily visualized. It was suggested that air may be trapped in the different layer border of soil.

5|$|Later {{morphological}} studies came to conflicting conclusions. A 1999 {{analysis of}} cranial measurements {{found that the}} quagga was as different from the plains zebra as the latter is from the mountain zebra. A 2004 study of skins and skulls instead suggested that the quagga was not a distinct species, but a subspecies of the plains zebra. In spite of <b>these</b> <b>findings,</b> many authors subsequently kept the plains zebra and the quagga as separate species.|$|E
5|$|The {{fundamental}} DNA-based research {{carried out}} by Singh and his colleagues on primitive tribes including the tribal population of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, provided critical insights into the evolution and migration of humans, suggesting the out of Africa route of modern humans about 60,000 years ago to the Andaman Islands. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> have furthered the scientific community's understanding {{of the origin of}} man in terms of evolution and migration from place to place.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} no {{scientific}} proof of any cause. However, diffusion weighted MRI studies taken from 12–24 hours following an episode has shown there to be small dot-like lesions in the hippocampus. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> have suggested a possible implication of CA1 neurons made vulnerable by metabolic stress.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Jaiswal {{studies the}} {{critical}} role of Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), typical for familial ALS, in the impairment of Ca2+mito handling and perturbation of Ca2+ homeostasis in SOD1G93A mice and cell culture models of ALS. <b>These</b> <b>finding,</b> reported in Molecular Pharmacology [...] and Neuroscience Journal.|$|R
30|$|Ultrasonography {{is useful}} for {{identifying}} haemobilia and potential underlying aetiologies. Haemobilia forms avascular tubular lesions of hyper reflectivity filling and expanding the biliary ducts and minimally mobile, hyper-reflective, avascular masses within the gallbladder. With <b>these</b> <b>finding,</b> serial ultrasound showing decreasing reflectivity over time is highly suggestive of haemobilia.|$|R
40|$|In 2000, annual mass {{administration}} of diethlycarbamazine and albendazole began in Leogane Commune, Haiti, to interrupt transmission of lymphatic filariasis (LF). After 5 years of treatment, microfilaremia, antigenemia, and mosquito infection rates were significantly reduced, but LF transmission was not interrupted. <b>These</b> <b>finding</b> {{have implications for}} other LF elimination programs...|$|R
5|$|In 1946, the {{historian}} Boris Rybakov, while analysing miniatures of ancient Russian chronicles, {{pointed out that}} most of them, from the thirteenth century onward, display churches with onion domes rather than helmet domes. Nikolay Voronin, the foremost authority on pre-Mongol Russian architecture, seconded his opinion that onion domes existed in Russia {{as early as the}} thirteenth century, although they presumably could not be widespread. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> demonstrated that Russian onion domes could not be imported from the Orient, where onion domes did not replace spherical domes until the fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|In June 1956 {{some more}} {{wreckage}} from G-ALYP was accidentally trawled up {{from an area}} about 15 miles south of where the original wreckage had been found. This wreckage was from the starboard side of the cabin just above the three front windows. Subsequent examination at Farnborough suggested that the primary failure was probably near to this area {{rather than at the}} rear automatic direction finding window {{on the roof of the}} cabin as had been previously thought. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> were kept secret until the details were published in 2015.|$|E
