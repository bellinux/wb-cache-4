5|$|Orangutans {{were known}} to the native people of Sumatra and Borneo for millennia. While some {{communities}} hunted them for food and decoration, others placed taboos on such practices. In central Borneo, some traditional folk beliefs consider it bad luck <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face of an orangutan. Some folk tales involve orangutans mating with and kidnapping humans. There are even stories of hunters being seduced by female orangutans.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the embassy}} had been tipped off {{that there was}} a spy {{operating}} in the facility in early 1944, Bazna found it increasingly difficult to gather intelligence. The British Field Office had warned the embassy of a security leak. Bazna forwarded the document to the Germans. The warning had come to Churchill from Roosevelt, who obtained the information given by a defector to the United States. A new alarm system in the British Embassy now required Bazna to remove a fuse whenever he wanted <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ambassador's safe.|$|E

25|$|During World War I, Commonwealth {{soldiers}} billeted in Stevenage {{are reported}} to have stolen the bones. It was rumoured that the soldiers could be persuaded to part with the bones for a fee but supplemented the supply {{with the help of}} a local butcher. A letter to a local newspaper revealed that in 1917, a resident went into the barn <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coffin and found horse bones. A nearby horse-riding school explained that copies of the will were still being sold and, if word got around that the coffin was empty, it could cause a drop in revenue. The coffin was temporarily removed in 1999 when the barn was refurbished. Some reports say that the coffin was found to be empty, though others state that the Letchworth undertakers who restored the coffin buried any remains. Trigg's plan had ultimately failed.|$|E
25|$|For {{things that}} may be {{considered}} as two-dimensional objects (like text), front-back reversal cannot usually explain the observed reversal. In {{the same way that}} text {{on a piece of paper}} appears reversed if held up to a light and viewed from behind, text held facing a mirror will appear reversed, because the observer is behind the text. Another way to understand the reversals observed in images of objects that are effectively two-dimensional is that the inversion of left and right in a mirror is due to the way human beings turn their bodies. To turn from viewing the side of the object facing the mirror to view the reflection in the mirror requires the observer <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite direction. To look in another direction, human beings turn their heads about a vertical axis. This causes a left-right reversal in the image but not an up-down reversal. If a person instead turns by bending over and looking at the mirror image between his/her legs, up-down will appear reversed but not left-right. This sort of reversal is simply a change relative to the observer and not a change intrinsic to the image itself, as with a three-dimensional object.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} hours of the morning on Wednesday, January 23, 1991, at {{approximately}} 1:20a.m., Lunsford spotted a suspicious vehicle travelling along U.S. Highway 59, a white 1981 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme with Maine license plates. Lunsford pulled the vehicle over to the side of the road and turned on his dashboard camera to record the traffic stop. He then got out of his cruiser and approached the vehicle. Inside the vehicle were three men, Baldemar Sambrano Villarreal, his younger half brother, Reynaldo Sambrano Villarreal, and their accomplice, Jesus Cortez Zambrano. Lunsford questioned the driver, Reynaldo Villarreal, and asked whether he had any ID on him, to which Villarreal replied no. He claimed that he had a driver's license but did not have it on him. He also said that he was helping his brother, Baldemar, drive the car. Unbeknownst to Lunsford, the three men had loaded the car with 31 pounds of marijuana, and were driving from Houston, Texas, to Chicago, Illinois, where they planned to sell it all. At 1:27a.m., Lunsford asked <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trunk of the vehicle and the men reluctantly agreed. Lunsford and Reynaldo opened the trunk and Lunsford could immediately smell the scent of marijuana.|$|E

Richard Kuipers of Variety commented that she is [...] "delightful as the sweet-natured girl who inspires everyone <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror and do something about it".

[...] According to Yelle, Malhotra's vision is a mirror image of Orientalism, namely Occidentalism. Robert A. Yelle also criticises Malhotra for his use of the term [...] "dharmic traditions". According to Yelle, Malhotra ignores the differences that exist among and within the various traditions of India. According to Yelle, Malhotra presents a thoroughly homogenized ideal of Hinduism, based on a limited choice of aspects from Vedanta philosophy and Yoga. Yelle ends his review with the remark {{that there has been a}} gradual improvement in Western scholars' knowledge of Indian traditions. To come to a real dialogue, Indians must also be willing <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror, and be open to self-criticism.|$|E
