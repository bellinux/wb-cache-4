This inheritance was challenged by his cousin, who argued that the re-registration was invalid; under this interpretation, Forbes would legally be considered a woman, and thus unable to inherit. The legal position was unclear, and it took three years before a ruling by the Court of Session was finally upheld by the Home Secretary, granting him the title. The case was held in great secrecy, with the effect that it was unable <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>in</b> other judgments on the legal recognition of gender variance, but has become more widely known since his death in 1991.|$|E

Chemical properties of americium were first studied with 241Am, but later shifted to 243Am, which is almost 20 times less radioactive.
