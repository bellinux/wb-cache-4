5|$|Despite the {{discovery}} of many hundreds of Iron Age sites in Scotland {{there is still a}} great deal <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> be explained {{about the nature of the}} Celtic life in the early Christian era. Unfortunately radiocarbon dating for this period is problematic and chronological sequences are poorly understood. For a variety of reasons much of the archaeological work to date in Scotland has concentrated on the islands of the west and north and both excavations and analysis of societal structures on the mainland are more limited in scope.|$|E
5|$|Sea snakes were {{at first}} {{regarded}} as a unified and separate family, the Hydrophiidae, that later came to comprise two subfamilies: the Hydrophiinae, or true/aquatic sea snakes (now 16genera with 57species), and the more primitive Laticaudinae, or sea kraits (one genus, Laticauda, with five species). Eventually, as it became clear just how closely related the sea snakes are to the elapids, the taxonomic situation became less well-defined. Some taxonomists responded by moving the sea snakes to the Elapidae, thereby creating the subfamilies Elapinae, Hydrophiinae, and Laticaudinae, although the latter may be omitted if Laticauda {{is included in the}} Hydrophiinae. No one has yet been able to convincingly work out the phylogenetic relationships between the various elapid subgroups, and the situation is still unclear. Therefore, others opted to either continue to work with the older traditional arrangements, if only for practical reasons, or to lump all of the genera together in the Elapidae, with no taxonomic subdivisions, to reflect the work <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> be done.|$|E

25|$|With the {{subdivision}} of the Amato territory, many residents became minor landowners. However many {{were unable to}} survive from these little farms and soon they sold their possessions to other landowners thus contributing to the consolidation of large territories under the ownership of few families, a fact <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> this day. While recent divisions among heirs has divided the large holdings, the lands remain, nonetheless, within the same families noted above.|$|E

With the Amur River Line north of the Chinese border being completed in 1916, there was a continuous railway from Petrograd to Vladivostok <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> this day the world's longest railway line. Electrification of the line, begun in 1929 and completed in 2002, allowed a doubling of train weights to 6,000 tonnes. There were expectations upon electrification that it would increase rail traffic on the line by 40 percent.|$|E
25|$|In 1814 the Governor {{called on}} a convict named Francis Greenway to design Macquarie Lighthouse. The {{lighthouse}} and its Classical design earned Greenway a pardon from Macquarie in 1818 and introduced {{a culture of}} refined architecture <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> this day. Greenway went on to design the Hyde Park Barracks in 1819 and the Georgian style St James's Church in 1824. Gothic-inspired architecture became more popular from the 1830s. John Verge's Elizabeth Bay House and St Philip's Church of 1856 were built in Gothic Revival style along with Edward Blore's Government House of 1845. Kirribilli House, completed in 1858, and St Andrew's Cathedral, Australia's oldest cathedral, are rare examples of Victorian Gothic construction.|$|E

25|$|In the 12th century, Nahua peoples {{migrated}} to the Valley of Puebla {{after the fall of}} Tula. Eventually, this group was able to displace the Oto-mangue speakers as the ruling class, pushing them to the area south of the Great Pyramid. Kaufman has proposed that the displacement of Mangue speakers to southern Mesoamerica happened at this point. However, the remaining in this area retained a certain amount of political autonomy, which would create division in the city <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> this day. The new lords, calling themselves the Chololtecs, shifted religious focus away from the Great Pyramid and to a new temple constructed to Quetzalcoatl. As part of this shift, some of the final construction phases of the Pyramid were destroyed. However, the Chololtecs would face continued hostilities from the previous inhabitants who dominated settlements around the city.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} question <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> be answered is what language or languages were spoken {{by the people}} and rulers of the empire of Teotihuacan. During {{the first part of}} the Classic period Teotihuacan achieved dominance over central Mexico and far into the Maya area. Possible candidates for the language of Teotihuacan have been Nahuatl, Totonac or Mixe–Zoque. Terrence Kaufman has argued that Nahuatl is an unlikely candidate because Proto-Nahuan did not enter Mesoamerica until around the time of the fall of Teotihuacan (c. 600 AD), and that Totonac or Mixe–Zoque are likely candidates because many Mesoamerican languages have borrowed from these two languages during the Classic period. Others find Mixe–Zoque an unlikely candidate because no current Mixe–Zoque settlements are found in central Mexico. Around 500–600 CE a new language family entered Mesoamerica when speakers of Proto-Nahuan, a southern Uto-Aztecan language, moved south into central Mexico. Their arrival, which coincides with the decline of Teotihuacan and a period of general turmoil and mass migration in Mesoamerica, has led scientists to speculate that they might have been involved somehow in the fall of the Teotihuacan empire.|$|E
500|$|Texas Tech (then {{known as}} Texas Technological College) fielded its first intercollegiate {{football}} team during the 1925 season. The team {{was known as}} the [...] "Matadors" [...] from 1925 to 1936, a name suggested by the wife of E. Y. Freeland, the first football coach, to reflect the influence of the Spanish Renaissance architecture on campus. In 1932, Texas Tech joined the Border Intercollegiate Athletic Association, also known as the Border Conference. The school's short-lived Matadors moniker was replaced officially in 1937 with [...] "Red Raiders", a nickname bestowed upon them by a sportswriter impressed by their bright scarlet uniforms <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> this today. That same year, the team won its first conference championship and was invited to the Sun Bowl. The game was played on January 1, 1938, and resulted in a 76 loss to the West Virginia Mountaineers. Texas Tech suffered four more bowl losses before their first postseason win in the 1952 Sun Bowl. Before withdrawing from the Border Conference in 1956, the Red Raiders won nine conference championships, the most held by a Border Conference member.|$|E

This church was destroyed by Sassanid Persians in 614. It was subsequently rebuilt, destroyed, and rebuilt again by the Crusaders. This final church was later destroyed by Muslims, leaving only a 12x12 meter octagonal structure (called a martyrium—"memorial"—or [...] "Edicule") <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> this day.

These revivals could last for weeks at a time.|$|E
2500|$|By the 1850s, many steam-powered {{railways}} {{had reached}} the fringes of built-up London (which was much smaller than now). But the new lines were not permitted to demolish enough property to penetrate the City or the West End, so passengers had to disembark at Paddington, Euston, King's Cross, Fenchurch Street, Charing Cross, Waterloo or Victoria and then make their own way via hackney carriage or on foot into the centre, thereby massively increasing congestion in the city. The Metropolitan Railway was built under the ground to connect several of these separate railway terminals. It opened in 1863, {{and was the first}} line of what was to become the London Underground.
