5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} {{come face to}} face with a lot of people that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they share with you what song <b>touched</b> <b>them</b> the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E

25|$|Ulla {{taught that}} the Rabbis ruled {{the skin of}} dead people contaminating so as to prevent people from {{fashioning}} their parents' skin into keepsakes. Similarly, the Mishnah taught that the Sadducees mocked the Pharisees, because the Pharisees taught that the Holy Scrolls rendered unclean the hands that <b>touched</b> <b>them,</b> but the books of Homer did not. In response, Rabban Johanan ben Zakkai noted that both the Pharisees and the Sadducees taught that a donkey's bones were clean, yet the bones of Johanan the High Priest were unclean. The Sadducees replied to Rabban Johanan that the uncleanness of human bones flowed from the love for them, so that people should not make keepsakes out of their parents' bones. Rabban Johanan replied that {{the same was true}} of the Holy Scriptures, for their uncleanness flowed from the love for them. Homer's books, which were not as precious, thus did not render unclean the hands that <b>touched</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

Forum, so I knew we were onto something with that one.|$|E
25|$|In 18 BC, Agrippa's {{powers were}} even further {{increased}} to almost match those of Augustus. That year his proconsular imperium was augmented {{to cover the}} provinces of the Senate. More than that, he was finally granted tribunicia potestas, or powers of a tribune of the plebeians. As {{was the case with}} Augustus, Agrippa’s grant of tribunician powers was conferred without his having to actually hold that office. These powers were considerable, giving him veto power over the acts of the Senate or other magistracies, including those of other tribunes, and the power to present laws for approval by the People. Just as important, a tribune’s person was sacred, meaning that any person who harmfully <b>touched</b> <b>them</b> or impeded their actions, including political acts, could lawfully be killed. After the grant of these powers Agrippa was, on paper, almost as powerful as Augustus was. However, there was no doubt that Augustus was the man in charge.|$|E

500|$|Followers of Norman {{held her}} in high regard: they {{occasionally}} fainted when she <b>touched</b> <b>them,</b> and some wept when allowed {{to meet with}} her. They painted several portraits of her, one of which they believed had healing powers. According to students, Norman healed them in their dreams [...] and sometimes reported seeing visions of her. Several times, group members chose to forgo cancer treatment, trusting in Norman to heal them. Tumminia says that Norman was a clear example of the German sociologist Max Weber's concept of charismatic authority. Norman sometimes had disagreements with students and excommunicated two senior assistants who questioned her, although she welcomed one back a few years later. If healing was unsuccessfully sought, the failure to receive it was sometimes attributed to disloyalty to leadership. Criticism of Norman was not tolerated by the group; Tumminia describes Norman's leadership style as [...] "benign authoritarian".|$|E
500|$|He took a boat {{to inspect}} the {{destruction}} around Pudding Lane at close range and describes a [...] "lamentable" [...] fire, [...] "everybody endeavouring to remove their goods, and flinging into the river or bringing them into lighters that lay off; poor people staying in their houses as long as till the very fire <b>touched</b> <b>them,</b> and then running into boats, or clambering from one pair of stairs by the water-side to another." [...] Pepys continued westward on the river to the court at Whitehall, [...] "where people come about me, and did give them an account dismayed them all, and word was carried in to the King. So I was called for, and did tell the King and Duke of Yorke what I saw, and that unless His Majesty did command houses to be pulled down nothing could stop the fire. They seemed much troubled, and the King commanded {{me to go to}} my Lord Mayor from him, and command him to spare no houses, but to pull down before the fire every way." [...] Charles' brother James, Duke of York offered the use of the Royal Life Guards to help fight the fire.|$|E

2500|$|Walter R. Hamilton {{was among}} those who {{completed}} the route. In his book The Yukon Story he describes the state of the trail thirty years after it was abandoned [...] "All evidence of the right-of-way and poles were gone, but in a few instances we found pieces of old telegraph wire imbedded several inches in the spruce, jack-pine and poplar trees that had long-since grown up and over the wires that <b>touched</b> <b>them.</b> [...] I found one of the old green glass insulators still attached to a galvanized wire. I kept it as a souvenir but lost it later with a camera and some clothing when a scow was nearly overturned on Lake Laberge." ...|$|E
2500|$|Polistes eythrocephalus is not {{commonly}} {{observed to}} tend or collect honeydew from aetalionids (treehoppers) {{or any other}} insect species. [...] Honeydew is {{a good source of}} carbohydrates, composed of a mixture of oligosaccharides. This mixture provides those that eat it with an energy source higher than that of floral nectar. [...] However, in one study done in Peru researchers observed a single female P. erythrocephalus among an aggregation of Aetalion reticulatum (treehoppers). [...] The female P. erythrocephalus stood among or below the treehoppers and <b>touched</b> <b>them</b> with her antennae. [...] Though they did not directly feed her, the honeydew accumulated below where the A. reticulatum were standing. P. erythrocephalus then collected the honeydew from the branch. This research provides the first bit of evidence that P. erythrocephalus may tend to aetalionids within its range.|$|E
2500|$|Cady Hansen (played by Jessica Stroup) - Sam's ex-girlfriend, and {{possible}} {{daughter of the}} Devil. Cady {{is the daughter of}} Mimi, the Devil's ex-girlfriend, but her true father is unknown. Although Sam is initially attracted to her, he suspects that she may be the Devil's daughter (a suspicion seemingly put to rest by Sock and Ben in [...] "Cash Out"). Despite his general calm to the situation, Sam's suspicions re-surface later on, due to her reportedly strange behavior around Andi and the manifestation of strange phenomena around her, such as breaking glass spurred by a kiss, and flowers wilting and dying several moments after she has <b>touched</b> <b>them.</b> At the end of [...] "Unseen", Cady, upset by the fact that Sam still has been distant and in her eyes deceitful, goes to New Mexico to stay with her mother and sort things out. If the Devil truly were her biological father as well as Sam's, that would make them paternal half-siblings.|$|E

[...] Clinton Kelly said, [...] "When I got the job, I told everyone I knew that we’d probably do 10 episodes, get canceled and I’d go crawling back to my old job in magazine publishing. So, I’m more surprised than anyone that we’ve lasted this long. At first I thought the essence of the show was making snarky remarks about people’s outfits, but as it turns out, 'WNTW' is about taking stock of who you are and communicating that non-verbally {{to the rest of the}} world. That’s incredibly empowering." ...|$|E
