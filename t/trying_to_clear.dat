5|$|Atlético de Kolkata had {{the first}} major {{opportunity}} {{of the second half}} when Jakub Podaný crossed the ball into the box with both Baljit Sahni and Arnal looking to head it in before David James came out to catch the ball. The Kerala Blasters soon had three chances in three minutes but could not convert any of those into goals. Just after the 60th minute, Kerala Blasters defender Sandesh Jhingan almost headed the ball into his own net while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> it. The Kerala Blasters continued to have the most chances throughout the match, which was compounded in the last minute of regulation time when Michael Chopra had his point blank range shot saved by Apoula Edel.

25|$|The {{university}} built sand volleyball courts at {{the south}} end of the park in 1991, which set off demonstrations. After the university police began <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> the park of protesters and arrested some demonstrators, riots began. Opponents saw the building of volleyball courts as yet another attempt by the university to transform the park's open space into eventual housing, parking, or other projects. The courts were dismantled in 1997. There had been little use by the public, and the maintenance costs were very high.|$|E

25|$|Many Aboriginal {{groups had}} become nomadic bison hunters in {{response}} to Euroamerican westward expansion and economic development, which had made the robe trade highly lucrative. The collapse of the bison population on the Great Plains eliminated {{the primary source of}} wealth of these groups in addition to destroying their lands and livelihoods. While white and indigenous hunters both contributed to the culling of the bison population, white hunters tended to be far more destructive in their hunting techniques. While Aboriginal hunting groups participated in the bison hunt in order to support themselves, Euroamericans were actively <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> the plains of bison populations to make way for settlers and domesticated animals.|$|E

500|$|The castle {{remained}} with the Percy family until the mid-18th century when it {{passed to the}} earls of Egremont. The lands and castle were then inherited by Elizabeth Seymour who assumed the name Percy and was later Duchess of Northumberland. Wressle Castle was occupied by a tenant farmer who on 19 February 1796 caused a fire which gutted the castle’s remaining wing. He had been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> the chimney. A report three months later in The Gentleman's Magazine noted that “This loss was of truly national significance". The farm continued to be leased to tenants, and the farmhouse which still stands was built [...] By 1880 the castle was partially covered in ivy. In 1957 the castle and farm were sold to the Falkingham family who own the site today.|$|E

The radio operator, Jack Phillips, may have failed to grasp its significance because he was preoccupied with transmitting messages for passengers via the relay station at Cape Race, Newfoundland; the radio set had broken down the day before, resulting in a backlog of messages that the two operators were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>clear.</b> A final warning was received at 22:30 from operator Cyril Evans of Californian, which had halted for the night in an ice field some miles away, but Phillips cut it off and signalled back: [...] "Shut up!

500|$|MacMillan {{himself had}} been {{involved}} in the National Council for Canadian-Soviet Friendship in the 1940s, though he had since quit that organization. In 1950, with an eye to taking the orchestra on international tours, he had written a letter to the American consul in Toronto admitting his former affiliation. He received his visa in November 1951 without any difficulties. After the six musicians were denied entry and before the orchestra had left for the United States, MacMillan solicited help for them from the Canadian ambassador in Washington, but his plea was unsuccessful. In January 1952 he wrote to US immigration officials <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> Staryk's name, lauding him as [...] "an exceptionally talented violinist and valuable member of the orchestra. I have no reason to doubt that he has no Communist affiliations other than that he played from ages twelve to fourteen with a Ukrainian orchestra that is under some suspicion". [...] His entreaties on behalf of Staryk did not help to exonerate the musician.|$|E
500|$|The 2008 Beijing Olympics caused {{traditional}} Hutong {{neighborhoods to}} be cleared {{for the construction of}} modern Olympic stadiums. In an effort to ensure success for the games, the government invested billions in building new infrastructure, although clearance to tiny, outdated neighborhoods in Beijing called hutongs resulted (Petrun). Jim Yardley, a New York Times reporter interviews Pan Jinyu, a 64-year-old local resident: [...] "They [...] don’t want foreigners to see this scarred old face". Feng Shuqin and her husband, Zheng Zhanlin have lived in their house for 50 years and the family has owned the property before the Communists took control in 1949. The government, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> the area, has offered them to move with a compensatory sum of $175,000 USD, but the family insists the land is worth $1.4 million USD (Yardley). Michael Meyer, an American who lives in the hutongs reported that a total of 500,000 residents were relocated from their homes before the Olympics began (Meyer).|$|E
500|$|In southeastern Pakistan, an {{estimated}} 6,000 people were evacuated from coastal regions prior to Cyclone Onil's arrival.

Two people were killed after being electrocuted by a downed power line outside their home. Many streets in the city were flooded and power lines were downed. Another one of these people died while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> a drain near her house when a wall collapsed on her. Offshore, 163 fishermen were reported to be missing after being caught in the storm. However, reports from Pakistani officials stated that at least 300 fishermen were missing.

500|$|On February 17, 2009, Brunner {{announced}} {{that she would be}} a candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2010. She ran against Fisher for the Democratic nomination. In September 2009, DSCC Chairman Bob Menendez, who supported Fisher and had been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> the field for him, stated he would actively work against any underfunded candidate, in which Brunner eventually responded [...] "I'm not scared of you" [...] at a fundraiser in Washington D.C. in December of that year. By February 2010, she had significantly less cash on hand than Fisher or likely general election opponent Rob Portman (who would eventually win the seat), but claimed, [...] "I only need enough money to win," [...] adding, [...] "And frankly, in this economic environment, it's rather obscene when people start crowing about how many millions they have on hand." [...] Polling in late 2009 and January 2010 showed Brunner to be more competitive than Fisher in a general election matchup against Portman, while Fisher and Brunner were deadlocked in Democratic primary polling. Her budget-spirited campaign employed [...] "Rosie the Riveter" [...] imagery and the use of an old school bus called [...] "The Courage Express" [...] to travel across the state. During the campaign Fisher faced accusations of being afraid of Fox News and being too staged and not genuine. The final Quinnipiac Poll released at the end of April showed Brunner leading Fisher among men 38-24% and defeating Portman 40-36%.|$|E
500|$|Now {{clear of}} the {{immediate}} danger of the ice, Riou {{found himself in a}} desperate situation. There was two feet of water in the hold and more was rushing in, while the sea was rising and a gale had sprung up. The pumps were manned, but could not keep up with the influx of water, and by midnight there was 6 feet of water in the hold. At dawn on Christmas Day, an attempt was made to fother the hull, which involved lowering an oakum-packed studding sail over the side to cover the gash in the hull and slow the flooding. This was temporarily successful and by 11 o'clock the pumps had been able to reduce the water to a level of 19inches. The respite was short-lived, as the sail split under the pressure of the water and the water level began to rise again. [...] A number of seaman requested permission to take to the ship's boats. Riou convinced them to stay, but another attempt to fother the hull with another sail failed when the sail immediately ripped. By nightfall on 25 December, the water in the hold had risen to 7 feet, and the ship was rolling violently, allowing water to pour over the ship's side. Riou ordered the stores, guns and livestock to be thrown overboard in an attempt to lighten the ship, but was injured when his hand was crushed by a falling cask while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> the bread-room. By morning the next day, the ship was settling by the stern, while the sails had been torn away in the gale. Again the seamen, this time joined by the convicts, requested to be allowed to take to the boats. Riou at last agreed to this, well aware that there were not enough boats for everyone, and announced 'As for me, I have determined to remain in the ship, and shall endeavour to make my presence useful {{as long as there is}} any occasion for it.' ...|$|E
500|$|Initially, Seltmann and Chater {{were not}} {{planning}} {{for an international}} release. They were not concerned with copyright restrictions and so did not keep a list of which tracks were being sampled. According to Chater they [...] "were really unorganised and were just sampling on the fly as tracks progressed... We had no idea the record would get such a wide-scale release so we saw no need {{to keep track of}} what we were using – we were definitely guilty of harbouring a 'No-one's going to listen to it anyway' sort of attitude." [...] The sources spanned many different styles of music and sampled artists include: Françoise Hardy, Blowfly, Sérgio Mendes, Raekwon, Wayne and Shuster and Madonna. Seltmann felt that [...] "he more rejected and unwanted the record that a sample comes from, the more appealing it is, I guess it's almost a reaction to rare record finding, but occasionally things like 'Holiday' come up". He described how making sample tapes for each other created some samples which were intended as [...] "funny samples" [...] that they had no original intention to get clearance for. In particular, Madonna's song [...] "'Holiday' was one of those where we put something together, ended it with 'Holiday' and all had a big laugh. It ended up where we couldn't live without it so I guess we just had to make that one work". Later, Seltmann and Chater had a few problems when <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> all the samples. One sample that had to be removed was from Rodgers and Hammerstein in the intro that featured harps and girls singing. After checking clearances, [...] "he album is slightly different to its original form in that it had a whole new introduction, which apparently was really recognisable, so we had to take that off straight away". The group played their songs to flatmates to get input on which tracks were worth including on the album. [...] "Electricity" [...] was the first song the group felt that worked; it was a last-minute addition to the album as the Avalanches felt the song [...] "still sounds good". In early 2000, Seltmann (as Dazzler) and Chater (as Bobby C) finished production on the album, using the pseudonym Bobbydazzler. It had received the official title, Since I Left You in March 2000.|$|E
