40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{morbidity}} and {{success rate of}} percutaneous treatment of the postoperative ureteric strictures in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 1994 and December 2003, 12 children were treated by antegrade percutaneous balloon dilation for postoperative ureteric strictures. Stenosis occurred at the pelviureteric junction in 5 cases and ureterovesical junction in 7 cases. The 10 boys and 2 girls were between 3 months and 14 years old (mean, 5 years +/- 4. 7 years). General anesthesia was used in 10 cases <b>for</b> <b>nephrostomy</b> catheter placement. Five ureteral stents were used additionally <b>for</b> <b>nephrostomy</b> drainage with a 6 -F catheter. Both nephrostomy and ureteric stents were in place for 28. 5 +/- 12 days, then removed after control antegrade pyelography. RESULTS: Dilation was technically successful in 9 of our patients. Two peroperative complications occurred. Postoperative results were evaluated by ultrasonography, intravenous urography, antegrade pyelography, and {{diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid}} renography that confirmed no obstacle in all 5 cases of pelviureteric stricture with a follow-up of 4 +/- 2. 9 years and in 4 cases of ureterovesical junction with a follow-up of 4. 7 +/- 2. 8 years. Three unsuccessful results were reported: in 2 cases, the guide wire could not be advanced over the stenotic ureterovesical junction and in 1 case an early restenosis occurred that eventually required surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Although the main treatment of the postoperative ureteral strictures is surgical, the percutaneous antegrade balloon dilation seems to be an alternative to surgery with a low morbidity rate and short hospitalization period...|$|R
