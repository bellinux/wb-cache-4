500|$|Mark Kirkland, who {{had visited}} Africa before, {{served as the}} {{director}} for [...] "Simpson Safari". When he was sixteen years old, Kirkland spent six weeks in Kenya with a film crew that was making a documentary film called A Visit to a Chief's Son. When he first read the script, {{he found that the}} episode was [...] "all over the place" [...] geographically. [...] "It would be like in the United States, saying: 'I walked out of Grand Central Station and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> left and was standing on the south rim of the Grand Canyon.' The locations are just all over the place" [...] he said in the episode's DVD commentary. Still, Kirkland strove to make the episode look as realistic as possible by drawing influence from his experience in Kenya.|$|E
500|$|On 30 August 2013, Tasci {{moved to}} Russian Premier League side Spartak Moscow for an {{undisclosed}} fee. Upon leaving Stuttgart, he told the press, [...] "It {{was not an easy}} decision. The present decision is not a decision against VfB, but for the new task. I had an incredibly great time at VfB, have played in the youth here, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> pro and recently been the captain. I have always said that I am a VfBler and that I will remain." [...] Immediately after joining the club, his debut was delayed by the injuries he sustained while at Stuttgart and he did not play for three weeks. He made his first appearance with the club on 2 October 2013 when he appeared in training. After damaging his meniscus, Tasci announced he would return in January following an operation. He made his debut for the club on 17 March 2014 in a 2–2 draw against Anzhi Makhachkala. He made three more appearances that season.|$|E
60|$|We {{heard him}} close the outer door and depart. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> to Louis.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Come on, officer,' says I, dignified. 'I {{may as well}} {{make the}} best of it.' And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>turns</b> to old Banks and rattles my chains.|$|R
6000|$|... "I nods at Mr. Biddle {{and sets}} {{down by the}} bed and feels the mayor's pulse. 'Let me see your liver--your tongue, I mean,' says <b>I.</b> <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>turns</b> up the lids of his eyes and looks close that the pupils of 'em.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> as <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> {{to inquire}} for Michelot, I espied him leaning stolidly against the porte­cochère.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> {{and went}} back to the wagons even more quietly than I had come.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good evening, Lady Silchester," [...] I answered, {{with all}} the dignity I could command. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> away and left the Castle.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> and bade the shopman command Kari to come hither {{and bring}} {{with him the}} choicest of our cups and jewels.|$|E
40|$|Flies, {{those little}} gray {{ones with the}} waxy. yellow abdomens, are everywhere, {{crawling}} across my legs {{on their way to}} the muskmelon rind on the porch railing; a few of them stop long enough to bite. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> and—WHACK!—slap the spot where a half-second before one ripped out a tiny piece of my flesh, ripped it out [...] . ...|$|R
60|$|Next my {{feet were}} bound. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> was <b>turned</b> over upon {{my back to}} look up into the faces of my captors.|$|R
60|$|The grave {{face of a}} not too {{recently}} washed angel peeps shyly at {{me through}} the railings, <b>then,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> my head, darts back and disappears.|$|R
60|$|I stood {{watching}} her litter till it vanished {{in the evening}} haze. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> to go to find myself {{face to face with}} Huaracha.|$|E
60|$|When he {{had gone}} I shut the door carefully. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> to Jeeves. The man was putting my evening things out on a chair.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked at}} him a moment open-mouthed. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> and {{looked again at the}} grey desolation of the street with the {{asbestos}} figures moving here and there.|$|E
40|$|This is {{a survey}} of the {{literature}} on liquidity provision through banks. I first formulate the basic model underlying the modern literature on liquidity provision for households and then introduce the more recent literature on liquidity provision through banks and markets. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> to liquidity provision on the asset side of banks' balance sheets and conclude with a brief discussion of how {{the two sides of the}} balance sheet interact. liquidity; banks; markets...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite," [...] I said absently, {{skimming}} p. l. And <b>then,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> over, a sharp howl {{broke from}} my lips, causing Aunt Dahlia to shy like a startled mustang.|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw {{as it was}} all up; {{the redskins}} war but fifty yards behind, and were gainin' fast upon us. So I says, 'Thar's your father, Miss, ride on for his sake,' <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>turns</b> my horse, and, with a pistol in each hand, I rides back at the redskins. The gal told me {{afterwards}} {{that she did not}} hear me speak, that she didn't know <b>I</b> had <b>turned,</b> and that all that time after she had first caught sight of the sojers seemed a dream to her.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> {{and went}} {{my way through}} the crowded streets, where the people made place for me, the {{astronomer}} of Cleopatra, for my fame had spread abroad.|$|E
6000|$|I {{looked and}} looked again till {{presently}} the vast loop {{vanished into the}} blue of heaven. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> and said--"I will come with you to Central Asia, Leo." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{watched the}} cab until it {{vanished}} round {{the curve of}} the road. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> about to a world that had become very large and empty and meaningless.|$|E
6000|$|That held me perplexed for a space. [...] . Well, anyhow I {{was leaving}} it all! Thank God I was leaving it all! <b>Then,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> to go on, I {{thought of my}} mother.|$|R
60|$|I hung my head. I had now {{no longer}} {{difficulty}} in collecting my thoughts--they circled round that point until I thought that remorse {{would have killed}} me. <b>Then</b> suddenly <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> {{with a look of}} gladness to my friend.|$|R
60|$|I {{stood looking}} at them, bewildered and {{astonished}} by Mademoiselle's loyalty. She seemed to have forgotten Nick, as had <b>I,</b> and <b>then</b> as <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> to him he came towards them. Almost roughly he took Antoinette by the arm.|$|R
60|$|I {{gave him}} a nod, as much {{as to say that}} it would all come right in the future, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> to Charlie again. He was {{beginning}} to pick up.|$|E
60|$|Our {{eyes met}} perplexed for an {{extraordinary}} moment. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> back and addressed myself a little stiffly to {{the substance of}} her intervention. For some time I couldn't look at her again.|$|E
60|$|I {{kissed her}} hand again lest she should doubt my intentions. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> upon the crew {{with such an}} {{expression}} as I know how to assume. In an instant the hall was empty.|$|E
6000|$|... "He! He!" [...] he cried. <b>Then,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> away, he put {{his head}} from behind the clock-case and tapped his {{forehead}} with his forefinger. So also did {{the man with the}} shiny coat, who stood before the empty fireplace.|$|R
6000|$|... "I might march north, colonel, {{as if to}} join General Goeben. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> could <b>turn</b> {{down this}} road which I see upon your map, and get to Chateau Noir before they could hear of us. In that case, with twenty men--" ...|$|R
40|$|I {{selectively}} survey {{several key}} strands {{of literature on}} financial risk measurement and management. I begin by showing why the need for financial risk measurement and management exists, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> to relevant aspects of return distributions and volatility fluctuations, with implicit emphasis on market risk for equities. <b>I</b> <b>then</b> treat market risk for bonds, focusing on the yield curve, with its nuances and special structure. In addition to market risk measurement and management, I also discuss aspects of measuring credit risk, operational risk, systemic risk, and underlying business-cycle risk. I nevertheless also stress the limits of statistical analysis, and the associated importance of respecting the unknown and the unknowable...|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> my eyes {{once more}} toward the flier. She was moving rapidly toward the city, and when she had come close enough I was {{surprised}} to see that her propellers were idle.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> to {{meet the}} renewed attack of the savage foe. One lion fell in his tracks, another {{stumbled}} to my very feet, and then I leaped within and slammed the portal to.|$|E
60|$|I {{did as she}} bid. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> {{toward the}} distasteful work that lay before me. This {{was no time for}} fine compunctions, nor for a chivalry that these cruel demons would neither {{appreciate}} nor reciprocate.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I do I shall upset," [...] {{answered}} the Gump. [...] "I'm {{not at all}} used to flying, and the best plan would be for me to alight in some place, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> can <b>turn</b> around and take a fresh start." ...|$|R
40|$|Most {{scholarship}} in modern Organisation Theory maintains a near-exclusive focus on privatesector settings. In contrast, this article argues that complex public-sector organisational systems – {{such as the}} European Union (EU) – can provide a very relevant laboratory to both fine-tune organisation theoretical propositions and test them empirically. I thereby first {{draw attention to the}} value-added of Organisation Theory for the study of EU institutions. <b>Then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> to these institutions’ capacity to present a springboard for theoretical development in Organisation Theory, and bring forward a number of avenues for further research on the intersection of EU studies and Organisation Theory that can push forward both research fields...|$|R
40|$|First, I briefly {{review the}} {{different}} conceptions of time held by three rival interpretations of quantum theory: {{the collapse of}} the wave-packet, the pilot-wave interpretation, and the Everett interpretation (Section 2). <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> to a much less controversial task: to expound the recent understanding of the time-energy uncertainty principle, and indeed of uncertainty principles in general, that has been established by such authors as Busch, Hilgevoord and Uffink. Although this may at first seem a narrow topic, I point out connections to other conceptual topics about time in quantum theory: for example, the question under what circumstances there is a time operator (Section 4. 3). ...|$|R
