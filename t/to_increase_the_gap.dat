500|$|By lap 39, Alonso {{had reduced}} the time deficit {{between himself and}} Massa as the latter was lapping the two Virgin cars. At the start of lap 40, Massa held a 1.2 second lead over Alonso, who in turn, was 5.2 seconds in front of Vettel. Hamilton in fourth place was 18.1 seconds behind the race, but was {{maintaining}} a steady gap to teammate Button in fifth. Webber was told by Red Bull over the radio <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> to Button, because his car was suffering from an issue with its oil consumption, {{and was told that}} braking harder into the track's turns would possibly assist in moving some oil around the inside of his car. Petrov made an error which allowed Kobayashi to take advantage but Petrov held off the challenge. A radio transmission from Massa's race engineer Rob Smedley was intercepted on lap 48, with Smedley telling Massa, [...] "OK, so, Fernando (Alonso) is faster than you. Can you confirm you understood that message?" [...] Based on Smedley's tone, commentators surmised that it had been a coded message from engineer to driver telling Massa to move over and allow Alonso through.|$|E
500|$|Massa {{responded to}} Alonso's quick pace with his fastest lap time <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> by four-tenths of a second. Button ran wide {{at the first}} corner and fell further [...] behind sixth-place driver Webber. Hamilton set a slow time which allowed Webber {{to close the gap}} to the former. Vettel became the first driver to make a {{scheduled}} pit stop for the hard-compound tyres on the 12th lap, and rejoined in sixth in front of Kubica. It was part of a strategy by Red Bull to place him into clear air in the hopes that he could make up some time on the leading Ferrari cars. Alguersuari drove alongside Yamamoto over the start/finish line and the Alguersuari passed Yamamoto for 19th entering the first corner on the same lap. Ferrari responded to Red Bull's decision by bringing Alonso and Massa in for their stops in quick succession, handing the lead to Button. Alonso rejoined ahead of Vettel, and was followed by Webber, but he exited the pit lane among a pack of slower cars and was immediately challenged by Kobayashi. Massa began to struggle with tyre temperatures and locked-up at turn two, and lost the balance of his car at the turn six hairpin.|$|E

As {{a part of the}} study we have formulated the concept of so-called "other" society under the social-humanistic paradigm. As it was mentioned earlier, social systems can be described as open-end ones, which implies their constant interaction with environment expressed via matter, energy, and information exchange. Because of that, the functional and developmental regulations are characterized by the presence of constant alteration as well, which stipulates the high complexity of structuring valid prognoses. Subject vs. object feedback determines special peculiarities of social prognosis, namely, the ones that are capable of either self-fulfillment of self-destruction of prognostic model. In other words, the predicted future influences the actual future.

The results from the study show that more than half of the respondents have a positive attitude towards ze. It is primarily in writing that the gender neutral pronoun is used; almost half of the respondents state that they prefer the word in writing situations. Language usage in general affects a persons attitude to the word ze, the more linguistic change someone has accepted, the more likely it is that they start using a future one. The conclusion is that linguistic changes take time, but despite that, ze have been established in the Swedish language and society as a gender neutral pronoun but not as a third gender category...|$|R
