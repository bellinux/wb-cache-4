500|$|In 1984, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation was {{planning}} to extend PA 145 and US 222. <b>Traffic</b> <b>engineer</b> Samuel D. Darrohh said that Allentown is one of few Pennsylvania cities without a traffic route going through it. After the plan was introduced, he said that motorists might be aided if US 222 is extended along Hamilton Boulevard {{to connect with the}} proposed PA 145 corridor. PennDOT originally planned the road as US 222 but AASHTO denied the extension, stating that the route [...] "is not the shortest or best available route between major control points on the system, and therefore, does not adhere to the policies established under AASHTO's 'Purpose and Policy Statement for U.S. Numbered Highways'". In addition, the route did not meet the criteria for a business route. In 1991, it was commissioned as PA 222. PA 145 was extended south of the US 22 freeway to the I-78/PA 309 overlap near Lanark.|$|E
2500|$|More recently, Georgia <b>Traffic</b> <b>Engineer</b> Martin Bretherton Jr. {{reviewed}} over 70 {{technical papers}} {{to find that}} multi-way stop signs do not typically control traffic speeds, and can create a variety of problems, including liability issues, traffic noise, pollution, enforcement problems and poor stop compliance when drivers feel that the signs have no justification. Fifteen studies found that unwarranted multi-way stops actually increased speed away from intersections as motorists try to make up lost time spent at [...] "unnecessary" [...] stop signs. Multi-way stop signs impose high vehicle operating costs, longer than needed travel times, excessive fuel consumption and increased vehicle emissions.|$|E
2500|$|Variations on Serrell's {{plan would}} be floated over the years. [...] A pseudonymous [...] "Terra Firma" [...] brought up filling in the East River again in the Evening Post and Scientific American in 1904, and Thomas Alva Edison took it up in 1906. [...] Then Thomas Kennard Thompson, a bridge and railway engineer, {{proposed}} in 1913 {{to fill in the}} river from Hell Gate to the tip of Manhattan and, as Serrell had suggested, make a new canalized East River, only this time from Flushing Bay to Jamaica Bay. He would also expand Brooklyn into the Upper Harbor, put up a dam from Brooklyn to Staten Island, and make extensive landfill in the Lower Bay. [...] At around the same time, in the 1920s, Dr. John A. Harriss, New York City's chief <b>traffic</b> <b>engineer,</b> who had developed the first traffic signals in the city, also had plans for the river. [...] Harriss wanted to dam the East River at Hell Gate and the Williamsburg Bridge, then remove the water, put a roof over it on stilts, and build boulevards and pedestrian lanes on the roof along with [...] "majestic structures", with transportation services below. [...] The East River's course would, once again, be shifted to run through Queens, and this time Brooklyn as well, to channel it to the Harbor.|$|E
30|$|<b>Traffic</b> <b>engineers,</b> <b>traffic</b> safety <b>engineers</b> and {{strategic}} planners within the regional {{office of the}} Swedish Road Administration, SRA (now part of the National Transport Administration). <b>Traffic</b> <b>engineers</b> are responsible for handling possible changes in speed limits on specific stretches of roads, while <b>traffic</b> safety <b>engineers</b> work in the broad field of road safety {{and strategic}} infrastructure planners are involved in planning {{the development of the}} region’s road networks with the focus on new investments.|$|R
30|$|Numerous {{planners}} {{within the}} Regional Development Council, municipal politicians, and <b>traffic</b> <b>engineers</b> {{at the former}} SRA emphasized that they prioritized mobility on the major roads, {{as well as that}} they strongly supported municipal politicians’ arguments on this issue. Some <b>traffic</b> <b>engineers</b> maintained in interviews that other colleagues, specifically <b>traffic</b> safety <b>engineers,</b> occasionally “run road safety issues too hard” and do not take sufficient account of the mobility-promoting dimensions of high speed limits.|$|R
30|$|Politicians, {{town and}} traffic {{planners}} and <b>traffic</b> <b>engineers</b> in municipalities. Municipalities have responsibility for implementing spatial plans, traffic safety strategies and local traffic regulations. In small municipalities, the leading politician (chief operating officer) often has direct responsibility for {{issues related to}} communications, infrastructure and investment in road transport, while in large municipalities, the responsibility for these issues is shared among two or more politicians. The municipalities’ ongoing work on speed and speed limits is implemented on a day-by-day basis by <b>traffic</b> <b>engineers</b> and town planners, where <b>traffic</b> <b>engineers</b> in managerial positions often have decision-making power as delegated by the municipality’s political leadership.|$|R

30|$|It is {{important}} to note that these organizations thus encompass heterogeneous actors—e.g. town planners, <b>traffic</b> <b>engineers,</b> <b>traffic</b> safety <b>engineers,</b> politicians and others—who typically have different professional backgrounds, different roles with regard to the setting and implementing of speed limits, and different knowledge in relation to these issues. Also, differences in professional profiles do not always follow organizational lines, i.e. <b>traffic</b> safety <b>engineers</b> are situated in both the former SRA and in municipalities, while strategic/town/regional planners are found in the Regional Development Council, the County Administrative Board and all municipalities.|$|R

5000|$|Most <b>traffic</b> <b>engineers</b> {{consider}} the street hierarchy to be optimal, since it eliminates through traffic on all streets except arterials. However, some have contended {{that it actually}} exacerbates traffic congestion, leading to air pollution and other undesirable outcomes. An alternative to street hierarchy, Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND) networks, recommended by the Institute of <b>Traffic</b> <b>Engineers,</b> implies that a type of hierarchy is desirable nonetheless. It suggests that [...] "While TND street networks do not follow the same rigid functional classification of conventional neighborhoods with local, collector, arterial and other streets, TND streets are hierarchical to facilitate necessary movements." ...|$|R
