25|$|The Punto was {{designed}} by Giorgetto Giugiaro and was available as a three-door or five door hatchback, and a two-door cabriolet. As {{the majority of the}} new Fiat group models, suspension was all independent, composed of MacPherson struts at the front and <b>trailing</b> <b>arms</b> at the rear.|$|E
25|$|Front {{suspension}} was by upper A-arms {{and lower}} lateral links triangulated by the anti-roll bar. Rear suspension was by tapering box-section <b>trailing</b> <b>arms</b> and lower lateral links. The half-shafts had {{no provision for}} plunge and handled some of the lateral forces. There were coil-over shock absorbers and disc brakes at all four corners. Steering was by an unassisted rack and pinion.|$|E
25|$|For the suspension, the B31 {{featured}} double wishbones, {{coil springs}} over dampers with an anti-roll {{bar at the}} front, and single top links, twin lower links, twin <b>trailing</b> <b>arms,</b> coil springs over dampers with an anti-roll bar at the rear. The brakes were ventilated discs all round, and the car had rack-and-pinion steering. As the car weighed , it had a power-to-weight ratio of exactly 0.5hp/kg.|$|E

25|$|The Riviera's {{suspension}} used Buick's standard design, {{with double}} wishbones {{up front and}} a live axle located by <b>trailing</b> <b>arms</b> and a lateral track bar in the rear, but the roll centers were raised to reduce body lean. Although its coil springs were actually slightly softer than other Buicks, the Riviera's lighter weight made its ride somewhat firmer. While still biased towards understeer, contemporary testers considered {{it one of the}} most driveable American cars, with an excellent balance of comfort and agility.|$|E
25|$|The Ibec design, while bespoke, was not adventurous. The main chassis {{was formed}} by a riveted and bonded {{aluminium}} monocoque, behind which the DFV engine and Hewland FG400 gearbox were bolted as stressed chassis members. Suspension was by double wishbones at the front, with twin <b>trailing</b> <b>arms,</b> parallel lower links and single top links at the rear. The car was clothed in fibreglass bodywork which had been properly wind tunnel tested, and which proved highly effective at generating both downforce in corners and stability at high speed. The total cost of designing and building the 308LM was less than £100,000, approximately £0.5 million at 2005 prices, more than most privateer teams, but far lower than many contemporary factory race programs.|$|E
25|$|By 1939 the TPV {{was deemed}} ready, after 47 {{technically}} different and incrementally improved experimental prototypes {{had been built}} and tested. These prototypes used aluminium and magnesium parts and had water-cooled flat twin engines with front-wheel drive. The seats were hammocks hung from the roof by wires. The suspension system, designed by Alphonse Forceau, used front leading arms and rear <b>trailing</b> <b>arms,</b> connected to eight torsion bars beneath the rear seat: a bar for the front axle, one for the rear axle, an intermediate bar for each side, and an overload bar for each side. The front axle was connected to its torsion bars by cable. The overload bar came into play when the car had three people on board, two {{in the front and}} one in the rear, to support the extra load of a fourth passenger and fifty kilograms of luggage.|$|E

500|$|Since the Andromeda Galaxy is seen {{close to}} edge-on, it is {{difficult}} to study its spiral structure. Rectified images of the galaxy seem to show a fairly normal spiral galaxy, exhibiting two continuous <b>trailing</b> <b>arms</b> that are separated from each other by a minimum of about [...] and that can be followed outward from a distance of roughly [...] from the core. Alternative spiral structures have been proposed such as a single spiral arm or a flocculent pattern of long, filamentary, and thick spiral arms.|$|E

2500|$|Like its predecessor, it had {{the engine}} mounted {{directly}} in front of the leading edge of the wing and the main undercarriage was also like that of the Type VIII, with the wheels [...] mounted in castering <b>trailing</b> <b>arms</b> which could slide up and down steel tubes, the movement being sprung by bungee cords. This simple and ingenious design allowed crosswind landings with less risk of damage. A sprung tailwheel was fitted to the rear fuselage in front of the tailplane, with a similar castering arrangement.|$|E

5000|$|The Weissach axle is {{a variant}} of the {{semi-trailing}} arm suspension. The tendency of a vehicle to oversteer when decelerating is compounded by the compliant bushings found in most <b>trailing</b> <b>arm</b> suspensions. When the vehicle is decelerating, the <b>trailing</b> <b>arm</b> pivots towards the rear as the wheel is [...] "pulled" [...] backwards relative to the chassis. This results in toe out, which makes the vehicle unstable.|$|R
2500|$|As Australian Moke {{production}} wound down, manufacturing {{was transferred}} to British Leyland's subsidiary in Portugal, which made 8,500 of the [...] "Californian" [...] Mokes in the Setúbal IMA plant between 1980 and 1984. In 1984 production {{was transferred to}} the Vendas Novas plant. Initially these Mokes were identical to late-model Australian Mokes; very soon, however, they were altered to use then-current British production Mini saloon components, including the standard-length Mini rear <b>trailing</b> <b>arms</b> and the 12–in wheels with modern low-profile tyres, which the saloon had acquired during the Moke's absence from Europe.|$|E
2500|$|Power {{went through}} either a four-or {{five-speed}} manual, or a three-speed automatic transaxle. The base engine produced [...] {{to accelerate the}} [...] Alliance from 0 to 60 mph in 14.3 seconds, and gave it an [...] top speed. Steering was rack and pinion. The suspension system was fully independent via MacPherson struts in front, while the rear had a compact and ingenious system of transverse torsion bars and <b>trailing</b> <b>arms.</b> At just under [...] for the base model, the Alliance was also the lightest car assembled in the U.S. in its time.|$|E
2500|$|Half-width torsion bars (full-width {{on higher}} spec models) with <b>trailing</b> <b>arms</b> at the rear, [...] and coil sprung MacPherson struts, {{attached}} to a thick pressed steel subframe at the front.

2500|$|Station wagons {{now used}} a unique [...] {{wheelbase}} and were larger than ever before. Station wagons {{continued to use}} unique model names. The Kingswood Estate wagon {{was considered to be}} equivalent to the Chevrolet Caprice being the top level wagon. Unlike previous years, station wagons used unique rear suspension using a solid axle with leaf springs as opposed to coil springs and <b>trailing</b> <b>arms</b> on sedans and coupes. Also new was the [...] "Glide-Away" [...] clam shell style disappearing tailgate. This design had the glass upper portion of the tailgate slide into the roof, and the lower steel portion slide into a compartment under the floor, providing a completely open space with no tailgate in sight.|$|E
2500|$|The Moke {{was built}} in Australia from 1966 to 1981 where it was {{originally}} marketed as the Morris Mini Moke and from 1973 as the Leyland Moke. Initially Australian Mokes had the same 10-inch wheels as British Mokes and Mini saloons but in 1968 these were replaced by 13-inch wheels with longer rear <b>trailing</b> <b>arms,</b> which made them more practical for gentle off-road or beach use than the British version. There was also a widening piece welded to the wheel arches, front and rear to allow for wider tyres and rims. [...] The solid metal seats of the British Mokes were replaced with tubular-framed [...] "deck-chair" [...] seats. This variant started with a 998cc engine, which was switched mid-production to 1,098cc. In 1976, {{with the advent of}} new anti-pollution requirements (Australian Design Rule 27A), the locally manufactured 1,098cc motor was replaced by an imported version of the 998cc motor with an air pump and exhaust gas recirculation, which had been developed to meet UK (US?) anti-pollution requirements.|$|E
2500|$|The Triumph Spitfire {{is a small}} British two-seat sports car, {{introduced}} at the London Motor Show in 1962. The vehicle {{was based on a}} design produced for Standard-Triumph in 1957 by Italian designer Giovanni Michelotti. The platform for the car was largely based upon the chassis, engine, and running gear of the Triumph Herald saloon, [...] but [...] shortened [...] and [...] minus [...] the Herald's [...] outrigger [...] sections, and was manufactured at the Standard-Triumph works at Canley, in Coventry. Unusually for cars of this era, the bodywork was fitted onto a separate structural chassis, but for the Spitfire, which was designed as an open top or convertible sports car from the outset, the backbone chassis was reinforced for additional rigidity by the use of structural components within the bodywork [...] (the [...] rear [...] <b>trailing</b> <b>arms</b> [...] bolted [...] to [...] the body rather [...] than the chassis). The Spitfire was provided with a manual soft-top for weather protection, the design improving to a folding hood for later models. Factory-manufactured hard-tops were also available.|$|E

50|$|At high mileages, this {{is prone}} to wear of the axle {{mounting}} bushes which is easily fixed. It is also prone to wear in the rear axle <b>trailing</b> <b>arm</b> bearings, which then wear the <b>trailing</b> <b>arm</b> axle tubes, requiring an expensive rebuild or a replacement axle assembly. The diesel and larger capacity petrol engines are canted {{as far back as}} possible in the engine bay, in an effort to put as much weight as possible behind the front axle line, also reducing the centre of gravity, while improving weight distribution and minimising understeer.|$|R
50|$|Front {{suspension}} of the Kabinenroller was by a transverse lower arm sprung by a torsional 3-element rubber spring at the inside end. Front suspension travel was limited by rubber buffers. Rear suspension was by a <b>trailing</b> <b>arm</b> similar to a single-sided motorcycle swingarm which also formed the enclosure for the chain drive to the rear wheel. The <b>trailing</b> <b>arm</b> was suspended by another torsional rubber spring. Hydraulic dampers {{were added to the}} design with the introduction of the KR200 in 1955; also the front track was increased at that time.|$|R
2500|$|The {{swinging}} {{arms are}} mounted with large bearings to [...] "cross tubes" [...] that run {{side to side}} across the chassis; combined {{with the effects of}} all-independent soft springing and excellent damping, keeps the road wheels in contact with the road surface and parallel to each other across the axles at high angles of body roll. A larger than conventional steering castor angle, ensures that the front wheels are closer to vertical than the rears, when cornering hard with a lot of body roll. The soft springing, long suspension travel and the use of leading and <b>trailing</b> <b>arms</b> means that as the body rolls during cornering the wheelbase {{on the inside of the}} corner increases while the wheelbase on the outside of the corner decreases. As the corning forces put more of the car's weight on the inside pair of wheels the wheelbase extends in proportion, keeping the car's weight balance and centre of grip constant. promoting excellent road holding. The other key factor in the quality of its road holding is the very low and forward centre of gravity, provided by the position of the engine and transmission.|$|E
