By "smart-scheduling" the electricity and domestic hot water demand of the dishwasher, clothes washer, dryer, sinks and showers solely to off-peak periods, the peak demand is reduced by 18 %, the part-peak demand by 32 % and the off-peak demand increased by 12 %. With this shifted schedule customers accrue twice as many credits as they would receive under a non-shifted schedule with the same <b>time-of-use</b> <b>rate,</b> totaling to $ 2975 of "free" electricity per year for one 12. unit building. But, under current rates smart-scheduling {{is found to be}} worthwhile only during the months from May through October, when 96 % of the credits are accumulated. If the rate schedule is altered to include peak-periods during the winter months, the credit savings will double again in value.

In 2008, Connecticut Light & Power implemented Variable Peak Pricing (VPP), a rate option that allows <b>time-of-use</b> <b>rate</b> customers to purchase on-peak electricity at daily-varying prices linked to the clearing of New England’s day-ahead wholesale electricity market. This study uses regression analysis to estimate the hourly price elasticity of demand for electricity of the 24 residential VPP customers. Using average hourly load data from 2008 to 2011, hourly electricity demand is modeled {{as a function of}} price, temperature, relative humidity, and hourly, weekday and household effects. A modified difference in differences estimation technique is also employed to in an attempt to make causal inference about the “treatment effect” of variable on-peak prices using a larger control group of residential <b>time-of-use</b> <b>rate</b> customers. The fully-specified demand models for the VPP subset indicate that consumers increase their hourly demand when prices increase; in contrast, the difference in differences technique produces a small but statistically significant hourly price elasticity of demand of - 0. 1. In other words, a 10 % increase in hourly price results in an approximately 1 % reduction in hourly consumption. This estimate compares favorably with the larger control group, with an estimated price elasticity of demand between -. 05 and - 0. 1. Low observed price elasticities of demand comport with previous research on dynamic pricing pilots indicating that large on- and off-peak price differentials are necessary to encourage load shifting.

40|$|This paper explores many of {{the changes}} in typical {{industrial}} assessment recommendations, which have resulted from deregulation of the electric and gas industries. While anticipating that energy efficiency would almost always be a good idea, changes in rate structures and indeed the very nature of how energy is purchased can put some energy efficiency technologies outside of normal economically acceptable ranges. A major focus will be changes in and the elimination of <b>time-of-use</b> <b>rates</b> for electricity. An entire generation of DSM'ers (people working in "Demand-Side Management") worked under the principle that there was economic benefit to load leveling. <b>Time-of-use</b> <b>rates</b> are changing throughout the country and in many cases disappearing. Bulk purchase of electricity has even resulted in cases where, with minimum consumption requirements, industrial plants need to find ways to increase their electrical use to avoid penalties. Energy storage devices including thermal energy storage must be re-examined in terms of this new paradigm. There are applications where they are advisable, but for different reasons then demand management. Another area of particular interest is fuel selection, multiply fuel capability, and contracting. An industrial assessment at two neighboring plants can result in entirely different recommendations based on how energy is purchased and billed. In many cases, an industrial plant may be better off spending resources on energy purchasing agents as opposed to anything like an energy efficiency project. Onsite generation of power and the changing rationales for its adoption has also experienced big changes. Energy security is becoming a strong motivation for industrial plants, options are increased, and third party funding is also starting to appear. Intermediate solutions like gas driven compressors bring these two areas together and leave industrial clients with more options but often more confusion than ever before. Finally, the paper discusses some of the new challenges facing an industrial assessment team in terms of information gathering. It is becoming necessary to examine many possible energy purchase options and each has ramifications on energy efficiency projects.

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} how {{public utility}} prices {{should be changed}} over time and space. Earlier static and non spatial models of public utility pricing emerge as special cases of the theory developed here. Electricity is emphasized although the models {{can be used for}} natural gas and other public utilities. If the transactions costs of price changes were zero, optimal prices should be changed continuously as supply and demand conditions change. Such prices are referred to as "full spot" prices. The full spot price of electricity at any point and time depends on total demand, availability of generating units, short run marginal operating costs of generators, the spatial locations of all supplies and demands, and the configuration of the transmission and distribution system. Since all of these are stochastic, so are full spot prices. Optimal "wheeling charges", i. e. price differences between points, also vary stochastically. In practise actual prices must be changed discreetly, and are therefore only approximations to full spot prices. Price changes are of two basic types. Predetermined price changes are adequate to respond to anticipated changes in conditions. Price recalculations are needed to respond to unanticipated changes. The optimal timing and mix of recalculations and predetermined changes depend on: the transactions costs of each type of change; the stochastic and deterministic rates of change of full spot prices; and the ability of customers and suppliers to change behavior in response to different price patterns. Conventional <b>time-of-use</b> <b>rates</b> recalculate prices systematically only at occasional rate hearings, and change them only a few times a day. Such prices deviate greatly from full spot prices, for many utilities. The thesis models customer behavior under full spot and other time varying prices, and discusses the types of customers likely to get the largest benefits from full spot pricing. The final chapter simulates behavior by four customers under six rates, from flat prices calculated a year in advance, to full spot pricing. The gross social welfare benefits of full spot pricing, before transactions costs, are three to ten times the benefits of conventional time-of-use pricing. The gross benefits of full spot pricing are less than ten percent of the customers' total energy costs. For small customers this {{may not be enough to}} counterbalance higher :ransactions costs from spot pricing. The thesis calculates "breakeven sizes" for each customer type such that larger customers should be on full spot pricing. These are on the order of one megawatt, for the customers and utility system modeled.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an assessment of}} the large-scale implementation of distributed solar photovoltaics in Wisconsin with regard to its interaction with the utility grid, economics of varying levels of high penetration, and displaced emissions. These assessment factors are quantified using simulations with measured hourly solar radiation and weather data from the National Solar Radiation Database as primary inputs. Hourly utility load data for each electric utility in Wisconsin for a complete year were used in combination with the simulated PV output to quantify the impacts of high penetration of distributed PV on the aggregate Wisconsin electric utility load. As the penetration rate of distributed PV systems increases, both economic and environmental benefits experience diminishing returns. At penetration rates exceeding 15 - 20 % of the aggregate utility load peak, less of the PV-energy is utilized and the contribution of the aggregate electricity generated from PV approaches a practical limit. The limit is not affected by costs, but rather by the time-distribution of available solar radiation and mismatch with the coincidence of aggregate utility electrical loads. The unsubsidized levelized cost of electricity from PV is more than four times greater than the current market price for electricity, based on <b>time-of-use</b> <b>rates,</b> in Wisconsin.

40|$|Adoption of {{real-time}} electricity pricing — {{retail prices}} that vary hourly to reflect changing wholesale prices — removes existing cross-subsidies to those customers that consume disproportionately more when wholesale prices are highest. If their losses are substantial, these customers {{are likely to}} oppose RTP initiatives {{unless there is a}} supplemental program to offset their loss. Using data on a sample of 1142 large industrial and commercial customers in northern California, I show that RTP adoption would result in significant transfers compared to a flat-rate tariff. When compared to the <b>time-of-use</b> <b>rates</b> (simple peak/offpeak tariffs) that these customers already face, however, the transfers drop by 29 %; even under the more extreme price volatility scenario that I examine, 90 % of customers would see changes of between a 4 % bill reduction and an 8 % bill increase. Though customer price responsiveness reduces the loss incurred by those with high-cost demand profiles, I also demonstrate that this offsetting effect is unlikely to be large enough for most customers with costly demand patterns to completely offset their lost cross-subsidy. The analysis suggests that adoption of real-time pricing may be difficult without a supplemental program that compensates the customers who are made worse off by the change.
