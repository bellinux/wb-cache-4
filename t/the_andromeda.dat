5|$|Apparently, by late 1968, no X-rays {{had been}} {{detected}} from <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> Galaxy. A balloon flight on October 20, 1970, set an upper limit for detectable hard X-rays from <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, radio {{emission}} from <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> Galaxy {{was detected by}} Hanbury Brown and Cyril Hazard at Jodrell Bank Observatory. The first radio maps of the galaxy {{were made in the}} 1950s by John Baldwin and collaborators at the Cambridge Radio Astronomy Group. The core of <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> Galaxy is called 2C 56 in the 2C radio astronomy catalog. In 2009, the first planet may have been discovered in <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> Galaxy. This was detected using a technique called microlensing, which is caused by the deflection of light by a massive object.|$|E

5|$|Close {{examination}} of the inner region of <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> Galaxy with the same telescope also showed a smaller dust ring that {{is believed to have}} been caused by the interaction with M32 more than 200 million years ago. Simulations show that the smaller galaxy passed through the disk of <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> Galaxy along the latter's polar axis. This collision stripped more than half the mass from the smaller M32 and created the ring structures in Andromeda.|$|E
5|$|Like the Milky Way, <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> Galaxy has {{satellite}} galaxies, {{consisting of}} 14 known dwarf galaxies. The best known and most readily observed satellite galaxies are M32 and M110. Based on current evidence, {{it appears that}} M32 underwent a close encounter with <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> Galaxy in the past. M32 may once have been a larger galaxy that had its stellar disk removed by M31, and underwent a sharp increase of star formation in the core region, which lasted until the relatively recent past.|$|E
5|$|Although {{globular}} clusters generally appear spherical in form, ellipticities can occur due to tidal interactions. Clusters within the Milky Way and <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> Galaxy are typically oblate spheroids in shape, while {{those in the}} Large Magellanic Cloud are more elliptical.|$|E

5|$|Another massive {{globular}} cluster, named 037-B327 {{and discovered}} in 2006 as is heavily reddened by <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> Galaxy's interstellar dust, {{was thought to}} be more massive than G1 and the largest cluster of the Local Group; however, other studies have shown it is actually similar in properties to G1.|$|E
5|$|Compared to the Milky Way, <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> Galaxy {{appears to}} have {{predominantly}} more old stars with ages >7 years. The estimated luminosity of Andromeda Galaxy, , is about 25% {{higher than that of}} our own galaxy. However, the galaxy has a high inclination as seen from Earth and its interstellar dust absorbs an unknown amount of light, so it is difficult to estimate its actual brightness and other authors have given other values for the luminosity of <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> Galaxy (including to propose it is the second-brightest galaxy within a radius of 10 mega-parsecs of the Milky Way, after the Sombrero Galaxy, with an absolute magnitude of around -22.21 or close).|$|E
5|$|In 1885, a nova-like {{outburst}} {{was observed}} {{in the direction of}} <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> galaxy by Ernst Hartwig in Estonia. S Andromedae increased to 6th magnitude, outshining the entire nucleus of the galaxy, then faded in a manner much like a nova. In 1917, George W. Ritchey measured the distance to <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> Galaxy and discovered it lay much farther than had previously been thought. This meant that S Andromedae, which did not just lie along the line of sight to the galaxy but had actually resided in the nucleus, released a much greater amount of energy than was typical for a nova.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, it was {{discovered}} that nine of the satellite galaxies lie in a plane that intersects the core of <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> Galaxy; they are not randomly arranged as would be expected from independent interactions. This may indicate a common tidal origin for the satellites.|$|E
5|$|M110 {{also appears}} to be {{interacting}} with <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> Galaxy, and astronomers have found in the halo of the latter a stream of metal-rich stars that appear to have been stripped from these satellite galaxies. M110 does contain a dusty lane, which may indicate recent or ongoing star formation.|$|E
5|$|The first {{professional}} astronomer {{to support the}} concept of an infinite Universe was the Englishman Thomas Digges in 1576. But the scale of the Universe remained unknown until the first successful measurement of the distance to a nearby star in 1838 by the German astronomer Friedrich Bessel. He showed that the star 61 Cygni had a parallax of just 0.31arcseconds (compared to the modern value of 0.287″). This corresponds to a distance of over 10 light years. The distance to <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> Galaxy was determined in 1923 by American astronomer Edwin Hubble by measuring the brightness of cepheid variables in that galaxy, a new technique discovered by Henrietta Leavitt. This established that <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> galaxy, and by extension all galaxies, lay well outside the Milky Way.|$|E

5|$|The {{future of}} <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> and Milky Way galaxies may be interlinked: {{in about five}} billion years, the two could {{potentially}} begin an Andromeda–Milky Way collision that would spark extensive new star formation.|$|E
5|$|While earlier {{findings}} {{suggested that}} the Milky Way galaxy contained more dark matter than Andromeda, {{and that it could}} be the largest in the Local Group - the 2006 observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope led to the revelation that <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> galaxy contains one trillion stars; at least twice the amount of the Milky Way’s stars, with the figure being estimated at 200-400 billion. It is also now evident that spanning approximately 220,000 light years across, Andromeda is the largest galaxy in our Local Group, which is also home to the Triangulum Galaxy and other minor galaxies. The mass of <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> Galaxy is estimated to be 1.5 solar masses, whereas the Milky Way's mass is estimated to be 8.5 solar masses.|$|E

5|$|A {{spiral galaxy}} is {{organized}} into a flat, rotating disk, usually with a prominent bulge or {{bar at the}} center, and trailing bright arms that spiral outward. The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a blue tint. Spiral galaxies are typically surrounded by a halo of older stars. Both the Milky Way {{and one of our}} nearest galaxy neighbors, <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> Galaxy, are spiral galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Based on its {{appearance}} in visible light, <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> Galaxy {{is classified as}} an SA(s)b galaxy in the de Vaucouleurs–Sandage extended classification system of spiral galaxies. However, data from the 2MASS survey showed that Andromeda is actually a barred spiral galaxy, like the Milky Way, with Andromeda's bar oriented along its long axis.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, astronomers {{discovered}} {{a completely new}} type of star cluster in <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> Galaxy. The new-found clusters contain {{hundreds of thousands of}} stars, a similar number of stars that can be found in globular clusters. What distinguishes them from the globular clusters is that they are much larger—several hundred light-years across—and hundreds of times less dense. The distances between the stars are, therefore, much greater within the newly discovered extended clusters.|$|E
