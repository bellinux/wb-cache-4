5000|$|A {{worn out}} man's buckle shoe was {{recently}} found in wainscoting of the Combination Room, St John's College, Cambridge, that {{dates from the}} mid to late 18th century. This was placed in the wall [...] "...as an apotropaic item intended to ward off evil and bad luck." [...] The discovery was exciting because this kind of magic is a silent tradition in England. After the repairs were done to the wall, the shoe was re-interred along with some current coins, a custom when dealing with finds like <b>this.</b> <b>Replacing</b> the shoe and concealing it respects the original desire of the owner.|$|E

In the North American 60GB models, original PS2 hardware is present to run PS2 titles, however the PAL and later models removed <b>this,</b> <b>replacing</b> it with software emulation working alongside the video hardware to achieve partial hardware/software emulation.

5000|$|Vertical lizard {{patterns}} in different colorways were apparently developed in Portugal {{from the original}} French patterns. The lizard pattern had been in use in Portugal since 1956 with the Air Force's Paratroopers, being extended to the Army's Special Rifles units in 1960. With the Portuguese Military engaged in the Overseas Wars mainly fought in the African jungles, the camouflaged uniform was issued throughout the Army and some units of the Navy and Air Force. In 1963, a vertical lizard pattern was developed, <b>this</b> <b>replacing</b> the French horizontal pattern. Paradoxically, the Portuguese vertical lizard pattern become popular amongst some of the guerrillas that opposed Portugal in the Overseas Wars and was latter adopted by {{the armed forces of}} some of the former Portuguese African colonies after their independence. The Portuguese vertical lizard pattern was adopted by Brazil, which developed a range of colorways for each of its armed services. Egypt, Greece, India, Lebanese Palestinians and Syria have all used variants of the vertical lizard pattern. SWAPO guerrillas in Namibia wore a wide variety of camouflage, including Portuguese lizard.|$|E
5000|$|The second suite {{begins with}} an {{introduction}} by the wind section, followed by the melody in the strings. The melodies are repeated by various sections throughout the first movement. In the suite, the opening section returns and concludes the piece. In the original version, the [...] "central" [...] section, which was a wordless chorus sung by women, ends the piece. The second movement intermezzo features utilization of low tones and begins with the wind section. Guiraud adds twelve additional bars to the concluding section. Sometime after this second suite was prepared from the L'Arlesienne music, Guirard extracted the Intermezzo movement, added the Latin sacred text of the Agnus Dei to it, and published it as yet another [...] "new" [...] work of Bizet. The menuet, which is not from L'Arlésienne, but from Bizet's 1866 opera The Fair Maid of Perth, features solos by harp, flute, and, later, saxophone (<b>this</b> <b>replacing</b> the vocal parts of the original); {{it is the most}} subdued and emotional movement. The finale, the farandole, incorporates the theme of the March of the Kings once again. This is an expanded combination of numbers 21 and 23-24 of the original incidental music, in which the farandole appears first on its own. It is afterwards briefly combined with the march.|$|E
50|$|Helen Dewitt {{plays with}} the {{language}} used and the visual effects created by {{the structure of the}} letters, making the novel feel more conversational rather than formal, and thus forcing the readers to sense with Sibylla’s perception and feelings. The story starts out with Sibylla trying to decipher a line of German, to which she translates to “It is truly something and something which the something with the something of this something....”(17). Repetition is a common literary device used to put emphasis on phrases and/or ideas; however, since Dewitt repeats the word “something” over and over again, specifically eleven times, this sentence feels rather unconventional. It still serves the original purpose: it emphasizes that Sibylla has forgotten much of German; but <b>this</b> <b>replacing</b> words one doesn’t recognize with “something”s is much more relatable than more formal novels. This repetition also presents itself in Ludo and Sibylla’s conversations: “Why are they fighting?WHY ARE THEY FIGHTING? WHY ARE THEY FIGHTING?”(26-7). This emphasizes that Ludo is a very curious child and often won’t stop asking until he gets an answer. In fact, Dewitt even uses capitalization to convey an eager tone. It’s as if Ludo is screaming at the readers for the answer, and compels the readers to imagine themselves in Sibylla’s position. In the same conversation, a very interesting repetition appears:”I know that” versus two lines later”I know THAT” and versus a few lines after that, “I KNOW that”(27). The phrases are identical, yet the capitalization emphasis puts different tones on them. They are all basically Ludo asking Sibylla for a different answer, yet the first one is just informative, second one is slightly impolite, and the third one conveys annoyance. In a later conversation, Dewitt adds another element to this play on language-the visual effects of the structure of words on a page. It is Ludo again asking his questions: “HOW MUCH MORE? HOW MUCH MORE? HOW, MUCH, MORE?”(34), and Dewitt this time uses italicization, bolding, commas, and a font size change, in addition to the all caps. First of, these three lines are right there when one turns the page from the previous one, and it creates a quite shocking impression. This shocking effect again relates to how Sibylla at the moment must’ve felt. Second, it emphasis even further how crazy and obsessive Ludo can get if he doesn’t get his questions answers, thus illustrating his curiosity at such a young age. Dewitt’s play with language and the visual structure of the words is definitely different from a typical novel with typical literary devices such as metaphors and such. Through using more relatable language and creating shocking images, she is able to not only do what typical literary devices could do, which is emphasis the important ideas, but also force the readers to experience with Sibylla and follow her feelings through the story. Her style of writing is very unconventional, yet very interesting, as new surprises, just like the huge “HOW, MUCH, MORE?”, unravel, as readers follow through the book.|$|E

This study investigates {{the potential for}} combining carbon dioxide (CO 2) sequestration with geothermal power production in areas with low geothermal resource temperatures. Using sequestered CO 2 as the working fluid or heat transfer fluid, power production of a Direct Single-Loop System and Binary Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) System were simulated using Engineering Equation Solver (EES) and the ASHRAE reference state for thermophysical properties. The two power plants were simulated {{under a variety of}} operating conditions, with the main variables being the reservoir temperature (100 ºC- 150 ºC), the mass flow rate of the CO 2 (70 kg/s, 90 kg/s, 120 kg/s, 140 kg/s), the reservoir depth (2. 5 km, 3. 1 km, 3. 6 km), and the condensing temperature. The condensing temperature was taken as the monthly average ambient wet-bulb temperature for the summer months of April through September and dry-bulb temperature for the remaining months of the year at Minneapolis, Minnesota. Results showed that using CO 2 for geothermal power production is a viable possibility. Power production from the simulations matched or surpassed the power production of currently installed low-temperature water-based geothermal plants. A second-law analysis showed that for the Direct Single-Loop System the largest considerations needed to be put into turbine design, while for the Binary ORC System the CO 2 heat exchanger should receive the most attention. In addition to <b>this,</b> <b>replacing</b> the expansion valve in the Binary ORC System with a supplemental power-generating device, such as a screw or scroll expander, has the potential for additional power production...|$|E
