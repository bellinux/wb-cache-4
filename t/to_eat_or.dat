5|$|Carrion, fungi, fruits such as chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), {{and seeds}} are also eaten. Two grey jays were seen eating slime mold (Fuligo septica) near Kennedy Hot Springs in the Glacier Peak Wilderness, Washington. This {{was the first}} report of any bird {{consuming}} slime mold in the field. Risk and energy expenditure are factors in food selection for the grey jay, which selects food {{on the basis of}} profitability to maximize caloric intake. Increased handling, searching, or recognition times for a preferred food item lowers its profitability. Grey jays wrench, twist, and tug food apart, unlike other birds known as jays (such as the blue jay, Cyanocitta cristata), which grasp and hammer their food. Grey jays commonly carry large food items to nearby trees <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> process for storage, possibly as defense against large scavengers.|$|E
5|$|Dayton Project {{employees}} {{were not allowed}} <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> smoke in processing areas, and had to scrub their hands before leaving these areas. They also had to shower {{at the end of}} each day's work, and were subjected to weekly urine tests. Employees with elevated levels of polonium were not allowed in the processing areas. Working with polonium without spreading contamination proved to be almost impossible. Fortunately, it was not a bone-seeker like radium or plutonium, and was readily excreted in urine. Detection methods had already been developed, making it easy to track. The employee at Unit IV with the highest levels of polonium in her urine had contaminated her hair, and often held bobby pins in her mouth.|$|E
5|$|Domestic cats select food {{based on}} its temperature, smell and texture; they dislike chilled foods and respond most {{strongly}} to moist foods rich in amino acids, which are similar to meat. Cats may reject novel flavors (a response termed neophobia) and learn quickly to avoid foods that have tasted unpleasant in the past. They may also avoid sugary foods and milk. Most adult cats are lactose intolerant; the sugars in milk are not easily digested and may cause soft stools or diarrhea. They can also develop odd eating habits. Some cats like <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> chew on other things, most commonly wool, but also plastic, cables, paper, string, aluminum foil, or even coal. This condition, pica, can threaten their health, depending on the amount and toxicity of the items eaten.|$|E

5|$|In {{people with}} AD, the {{increasing}} impairment {{of learning and}} memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small percentage, difficulties with language, executive functions, perception (agnosia), or execution of movements (apraxia) are more prominent than memory problems. AD does not affect all memory capacities equally. Older memories of the person's life (episodic memory), facts learned (semantic memory), and implicit memory (the memory of the body {{on how to do}} things, such as using a fork <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> how to drink from a glass) are affected to a lesser degree than new facts or memories.|$|E
5|$|Since then, Jackson {{has further}} {{clarified}} {{the origins and}} the nature of the bad blood between the two. According to Jackson, the rivalry exists because he was one of the few fighters in Japan who was not afraid of Silva outside of the ring. Jackson stated that fighters were afraid <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> be in an elevator with Silva, but he was not one of them. He added that the bad blood is only coming from Silva's end. Silva, on the other hand, cited Jackson's apparent insults towards him on the internet to account for the bad blood in an interview prior to the UFC 92 fight.|$|E

This ban was supposedly because beans resembled male genitalia, but it is possible that this was because of a belief that beans and humans were created from the same material.|$|E

25|$|Maintaining {{the balance}} of humors within a patient {{occurred}} in several ways. An initial examination took place as standard for a physician to properly evaluate the patient. The patient's home climate, their normal diet, and astrological charts were regarded during consultation. The heavens influenced every person in different ways by influencing elements connected to certain humors, important information in reaching a diagnosis. The physician could determine which humor was unbalanced in the patient and prescribe a new diet to restore that balance. Diet not only included food <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> avoid but also an exercise regimen and medication.|$|E

When he finally returned to Taiwan, five months had passed. The trip took a heavy toll on his health. He barely had the strength <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> talk. However, when people came to him with questions on Buddhism, he would summon his strength and answer spiritedly.|$|E

Huerta saw that her students, many of them children of farm workers, were living in poverty without enough food <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> other basic necessities.

On the rare occasions that they do manage to find something <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> drink, the food or water burns their neck as it goes down to their belly, causing them intense agony.|$|E
25|$|Methods of fasting also {{vary widely}} and cover a broad spectrum. If {{followed}} strictly, the person fasting does not partake any {{food or water}} from the previous day's sunset until 48 minutes after the following day's sunrise. Fasting can also mean limiting oneself to one meal during the day, abstaining from eating certain food types or eating only certain food types. In any case, the fasting person is not supposed <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> even touch any animal products (i.e., meat, eggs) except dairy products. Amongst Hindus during fasting, starchy items such as Potatoes, Sago and Sweet potatoes are allowed. The other allowed food items include milk products, peanuts and fruits. It {{should be noted that}} peanuts and the starchy items mentioned above originate outside India.|$|E
