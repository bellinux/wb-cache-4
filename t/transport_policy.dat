(JAZ), an 80 percent-owned low-cost charter subsidiary of Japan Airlines (JAL), to operate leisure flights to Asia-Pacific resort destinations from regional airports in Japan; {{in response to}} a Ministry of <b>Transport</b> <b>policy.</b> JAZ obtained its aircraft from JAL; its cockpit crews were American contract pilots based in Hawaii and its cabin crews were hired and based in Bangkok, where it operates a cabin crew training centre. JAZ obtained license to operate non-scheduled services on February 22, 1991 and operated its first charter flight from Fukuoka to Honolulu with a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 on July 1. The airline celebrated its 100,000th passenger on July 9, 1993, in a ceremony held in Sendai.|$|E
5|$|The Greater London Labour Manifesto for the 1981 elections, {{although}} written under McIntosh's leadership, {{had been}} {{determined by a}} special conference of the London Labour Party in October 1980 in which Livingstone's speech had been decisive on <b>transport</b> <b>policy.</b> The manifesto focused on job creation schemes and cutting London Transport fares, and it was to these issues that Livingstone's administration turned. One primary manifesto focus had been a pledge known as Fares Fair, which focused on reducing London Underground fares and freezing them at that lower rate. Based on a fare freeze implemented by the South Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council in 1975, it was widely {{considered to be a}} moderate and mainstream policy by Labour, which it was hoped would get more Londoners using public transport, thereby reducing congestion. In October 1981, the GLC implemented their policy, cutting London Transport fares by 32%; to fund the move, the GLC planned to increase the London rates.|$|E

25|$|With the <b>transport</b> <b>policy</b> {{pursued by}} the government, and more general changes in {{lifestyle}} favouring travel by road, the Big Four railways never ran a healthy profit. Indeed, the LNER never made a profit at all. However, they were still able to produce the world-leading services on the East Coast Main Line, running trains at speeds of up to 110mph, a remarkable achievement. Also the SR invested heavily in electrification of all its lines, and this electrification was done at a far faster rate {{than at any time}} under BR.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{entities}} {{are involved in}} transport infrastructure in Auckland (road, rail, public transport). Central government agencies involved in planning and funding road and rail infrastructure include the Ministry of Transport (<b>transport</b> <b>policy),</b> Land Transport New Zealand (funding and safety management), Transit New Zealand (management and development of State highways), and ONTRACK (management {{and development of the}} rail network). Land Transport New Zealand and Transit will be replaced by the New Zealand Transport Agency from 1 July 2008. Regional entities involved in transport planning and public transport include the ARC, the Regional Land Transport Committee, and the Auckland Regional Transport Authority. In addition local councils own, build, and manage local roads (all roads that are not State highways).|$|E
25|$|The {{competition}} from road transport during the 1920s and 1930s greatly reduced the revenue {{available to the}} railways, even though the needs for maintenance on the network had never been higher, as investment had been deferred over the past decade. Rail companies accused the government of favouring road haulage {{through the construction of}} roads subsidised by the taxpayer, while restricting the rail industry's ability to use flexible pricing because it was held to nationally agreed rate cards. The government response was to commission several inconclusive reports; the Salter Report of 1933 finally recommended that road transport should be taxed directly to fund the roads and increased Vehicle Excise Duty and fuel duties were introduced. It also noted that many small lines would never be likely to compete with road haulage. Although these road pricing changes helped their survival, the railways entered a period of slow decline, owing to a lack of investment and changes in <b>transport</b> <b>policy</b> and lifestyles.|$|E

30|$|Many <b>transport</b> <b>policies</b> {{can have}} an impact on {{constraining}} rates of car ownerships. For example, in Buehler’s comparative study between Germany and the United States (U.S.) suggested that built environment and demographic factors have no effect on car ownership but have an impact in making <b>transport</b> <b>policies</b> [44]. This study suggests that the higher rate of car ownership in the U.S. is attributable to the relatively low cost of driving. Similar findings are evidenced by the policies of license auction and parking pricing in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Singapore [11, 45, 46, 47]. In addition, recent car sharing programs have also demonstrated effectiveness in reducing rates of car ownership [48]. In sum, <b>transport</b> <b>policies</b> are more effective in reducing cars than planning strategies.|$|R
