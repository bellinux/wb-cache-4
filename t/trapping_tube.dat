40|$|The studies {{described}} in this thesis were conducted to evaluate field application of the antigen-detection tube Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit developed by Nantulya (1989) for diagnosis of Trypanosoma evansi infections in camels. The study was carried out on a herd of 100 camels in a T. evansi endemic area of Marsabit District, Northern Kenya. Blood samples were collected from each camel on four occasions; twice in the dry season and twice in the wet season. A total of 394 samples were collected. The results obtained using the tube-ELISA kit were {{compared with those of}} antigen trapping microplate ELISA, packed cell volume (PCY), the buffy coat technique (BCT), and antibody ELISA. From each camel 3 ml of blood was collected by jugular venipuncture into a vacutainer tube containing ethylene diamine tetra acetate (EDTA) as anticoagulant, mixed and stored in a cool place. The EDT A blood was used for the following tests in the field: Packed cell volume (PCY) determination, buffy coat smear and antigen <b>trapping</b> <b>tube</b> ELISA. Simultaneously, lOml blood was collected from each camel into a silicon coated vacutainer tube for serum separation. The serum was separated 12 hours after collection, transported to the laboratory and stored at - 200 C until required for tube and microplate antigen trapping ELISA, and antibody ELISA. For tube ELISA, 500,LLI of whole blood or serum were used per tube and each sample was tested in duplicate. Fifty microlitres of serum were used per well in the antigen trapping microplate-ELISA, while 10 - 20,LLI were used in antibody ELISA. An optical density greater than twice that of the negative control serum was regarded as positive in the case of microplate ELISA. The criterion for positivity in tube ELISA was development of a visible green colour in the tube. Anaemia was the only presenting clinical sign: PCV values below 25 % were recorded in 7 % of the blood samples examined. However, anaemia did not correlate well with other findings and was thought to have been due to factors other than trypanosomiasis. Trypanosomes were observed in the buffy coat in 1 % of the samples examined, while antigens were detected in 10 % of the samples by tube ELISA both in the field and in the laboratory, and in 5 % by microplate ELISA. Antibodies were detected in 45 % of the samples by antibody ELISA. The differences in the ability to detect infection of antigen trapping tube-ELISA, the microplate ELISA, the BCT and antibody ELISA were all statistically significant. These findings indicated that of all the tests carried out, antibody ELISA obtained the highest prevalence rates of infection. However, the presence of antibodies in the blood does not necessarily indicate that the animal has an active infection. Thus, the high prevalence rates of infection detected by antibody ELISA could be due to persistence of antibodies in cured animals. Of all the tests that detect active infections, the antigen trapping tube- ELISA, whether performed in the field using whole blood or in the laboratory using serum, obtained higher prevalence rates of infection than the microplate antigen trapping ELISA and the BeT. The tube ELISA was easy to perform in the field and the results were obtained within three hours after sampling all the animals. Thus, it would be possible, using this test, to treat the positive animals before they are released from the "boma". Regarding sensitivity and specificity of the three field applicable tests, namely; tube-ELISA using both whole blood and serum, and the BCT, tube-ELISA using whole blood was the most sensitive and ranked second after the BeT in specificity. The BeT was, however, the least sensitive. These findings support the use of tube-ELISA and BCT as complementary tests in the field diagnosis of camel trypanosomiasis...|$|E

Timelike evolutions occur when (ρ - P) is greater than this cut-off and so would be expected to be more common for large black holes.

40|$|Abstract To date, neither {{primates}} nor {{birds have}} shown {{clear evidence of}} causal knowledge when attempting to solve the <b>trap</b> <b>tube</b> task. One factor that may have con-tributed to mask the knowledge that subjects may have about the task is that subjects were only allowed to push the reward away from them, which is a particularly difficult ac-tion for primates in certain problem solving situations. We presented five orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), two chim-panzees (Pan troglodytes), two bonobos (Pan paniscus), and one gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) with a modified <b>trap</b> <b>tube</b> that allowed subjects to push or rake the reward with the tool. In two additional follow-up tests, we inverted the tube 180 ◦ rendering the trap nonfunctional and also presented subjects with the original task {{in which they were}} required to push the reward out of the tube. Results showed that {{all but one of the}} subjects preferred to rake the reward. Two orangutans and one chimpanzee (all of whom preferred to rake the reward), consistently avoided the trap only when it was functional but failed the original task. These find-ings suggest that some great apes may have some causal knowledge about the trap-tube task. Their success, how-ever, depended on whether they were allowed to choose certain tool-using actions...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} a geometric horizon, which is a surface distinguished by the vanishing of certain curvature invariants which characterize its special algebraic character. We motivate its use for the detection of the event horizon of a stationary black hole by providing a set of appropriate scalar polynomial curvature invariants that vanish on this surface. We extend this result by proving that a non-expanding horizon, which generalizes a Killing horizon, coincides with the geometric horizon. Finally, we consider the imploding spherically symmetric metrics and show that the geometric horizon identifies a unique quasi-local surface corresponding to the unique spherically symmetric marginally <b>trapped</b> <b>tube,</b> implying that the spherically symmetric dynamical black holes admit a geometric horizon. Based on these results, we propose a suite of conjectures concerning the application of geometric horizons to more general dynamical black hole scenarios. Comment: 52 page...|$|R

40|$|A dual {{foliation}} {{treatment of}} General Relativity is presented. The basic {{idea of the}} construction is to consider two foliations of a spacetime by spacelike hypersurfaces and relate the two geometries. The treatment {{is expected to be}} useful in various situations, and in particular whenever one would like to compare objects represented in different coordinates. Potential examples include the construction of initial data and the study of <b>trapped</b> <b>tubes.</b> It is common for studies in mathematical relativity to employ a double-null gauge. In such studies local well-posedness is treated by referring back, for example, to the generalized harmonic formulation, global properties of solutions being treated in a separate formalism. As a first application of the dual foliation formulation we find that one can in fact obtain local well-posedness in the double-null coordinates directly, which should allow their use in numerical relativity with standard methods. With due care it is expected that practically any coordinates can be used with this approach. Comment: 14 page...|$|R

We describe a situation where the evolving outermost MOTS must jump during the coalescence of two seperate MOTSs. We furthermore characterize the behavior of MOTSs in the case that the principal eigenvalue vanishes under a genericity assumption. This leads to a regularity result for the tube of outermost MOTSs under the genericity assumption. This tube is then smooth up to finitely many jump times.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} recurrence-time {{statistics}} (RTS) in three-dimensional non-Hamiltonian volume preserving systems (VPS) : an extended standard map, and a fluid model. The extended map {{is a standard}} map weakly coupled to an extra-dimension which contains a deterministic regular, mixed (regular and chaotic) or chaotic motion. The extra-dimension strongly enhances the trapping times inducing plateaus and distinct algebraic and exponential decays in the RTS plots. The combined analysis of the RTS with the classification of ordered and chaotic regimes and scaling properties, allows us to describe the intricate way trajectories penetrate the before impenetrable regular islands from the uncoupled case. Essentially the plateaus found in the RTS are related to trajectories that stay long times inside <b>trapping</b> <b>tubes,</b> not allowing recurrences, and then penetrates diffusively the islands (from the uncoupled case) by a diffusive motion along such tubes in the extra-dimension. All asymptotic exponential decays for the RTS are related to an ordered regime (quasi-regular motion) and a mixing dynamics is conjectured for the model. These results are compared to the RTS of the standard map with dissipation or noise, showing the peculiarities obtained by using three-dimensional VPS. We also analyze the RTS for a fluid model and show remarkable similarities to the RTS in the extended standard map problem. Comment: 10 pages and 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|To exhibit {{intelligent}} behavior, cognitive robots {{must have}} some knowledge {{about the consequences of}} their actions and their value {{in the context of the}} goal being realized. We present a neural framework using which explorative sensorimotor experiences of cognitive robots can be efficiently ‘internalized’ using growing sensorimotor maps and planning realized using goal induced quasi-stationary value fields. Further, if there are no predefined reward functions (or the case when they are not good enough in a slightly modified world), the robot will have to try and realize its goal by exploration after which reward/penalty is given at the end. This paper proposes three simple rules for distribution of the received end reward among the contributing neurons in a high dimensional sensorimotor map. Importantly, reward/penalty distribution over hundreds of neurons in the sensorimotor map is computed one shot. This resulting reward distribution can be visualized as an additional value field, representing the new learnt experience and can be combined with other such fields in a context dependent fashion to plan/compose novel emergent behavior. The simplicity and efficiency of the approach is illustrated through the resulting behaviors of the GNOSYS robot in two different scenarios (a) learning ‘when’ to optimize ‘what constraint’ while realizing spatial goals and (b) learning to push a ball intelligently to the corners of a table, while avoiding traps randomly placed by the teacher (this scenario replicates the famous <b>trap</b> <b>tube</b> paradigm from animal reasoning carried out on chimpanzees, capuchins and infants) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} near-horizon spacetime for {{isolated}} and dynamical trapping horizons (equivalently marginally outer <b>trapped</b> <b>tubes).</b> The metric is expanded relative to an ingoing Gaussian null coordinate and {{the terms of}} that expansion are explicitly calculated to second order. For the spacelike case, knowledge of the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of the (dynamical) horizon is sufficient to determine the near-horizon spacetime, while for the null case (an isolated horizon) more information is needed. In both cases spacetime is allowed to be of arbitrary dimension and the formalism accomodates both general relativity {{as well as more}} general field equations. The formalism is demonstrated for two applications. First, spacetime is considered near an isolated horizon and the construction is both checked against the Kerr-Newman solution and compared to the well-known near-horizon limit for stationary extremal black hole spacetimes. Second, spacetime is examined in the vicinity of a slowly evolving horizon and it is demonstrated that there is always an event horizon candidate in this region. The geometry and other properties of this null surface match those of the slowly evolving horizon to leading order and in this approximation the candidate evolves in a locally determined way. This generalizes known results for Vaidya as well as certain spacetimes known from studies of the fluid-gravity correspondence.

40|$|Motivated by {{the goal}} for high {{accuracy}} modeling of gravitational radiation emitted by isolated systems, recently, there has been renewed interest in the numerical solution of the hyperboloidal initial value problem for Einstein's field equations in which the outer boundary of the numerical grid is placed at null infinity. In this article, we numerically implement the tetrad-based approach presented in [J. M. Bardeen, O. Sarbach, and L. T. Buchman, Phys. Rev. D 83, 104045 (2011) ] for a spherically symmetric, minimally coupled, self-gravitating scalar field. When this field is massless, the evolution system reduces to a regular, first-order symmetric hyperbolic system of equations for the conformally rescaled scalar field which is coupled {{to a set of}} singular elliptic constraints for the metric coefficients. We show how to solve this system based on a numerical finite-difference approximation, obtaining stable numerical evolutions for initial black hole configurations which are surrounded by a spherical shell of scalar field, part of which disperses to infinity and part of which is accreted by the black hole. As a non-trivial test, we study the tail decay of the scalar field along different curves, including one along the marginally <b>trapped</b> <b>tube,</b> one describing the world line of a timelike observer at a finite radius outside the horizon, and one corresponding to a generator of null infinity. Our results are in perfect agreement with the usual power-law decay discussed in previous work. This article also contains a detailed analysis for the asymptotic behavior and regularity of the lapse, conformal factor, extrinsic curvature and the Misner-Sharp mass function along constant mean curvature slices.

40|$|Natural/Artificial {{systems that}} are capable of {{utilizing}} thoughts at the service of their actions are gifted with the profound opportunity to mentally manipulate the causal structure of their physical interactions with the environment. A cognitive robot can in this way virtually reason about how an unstructured world should “change,” such that it becomes a little bit more conducive towards realization of its internal goals. In this article, we describe the various internal models for real/mental action generation developed in the GNOSYS Cognitive architecture and demonstrate how their coupled interactions can endow the GNOSYS robot with a preliminary ability to virtually manipulate neural activity in its mental space in order to initiate flexible goal-directed behavior in its physical space. Making things more interesting (and computationally challenging) {{is the fact that the}} environment in which the robot seeks to achieve its goals consists of specially crafted “stick and ball” versions of real experimental scenarios from animal reasoning (like tool use in chimps, novel tool construction in Caledonian crows, the classic <b>trap</b> <b>tube</b> paradigm, and their possible combinations). We specifically focus on the progressive creation of the following internal models in the behavioral repertoire of the robot: (a) a passive motion paradigm based forward inverse model for mental simulation/real execution of goal-directed arm (and armC tool) movements; (b) a spatial mental map of the playground; and (c) an internal model representing the causality of pushing objects and further learning to push intelligently in order to avoid randomly placed traps in the trapping groove. After presenting the computational architecture for the internal models, we demonstrate how the robot can use them to mentally compose a sequence of “Push–Move–Reach” in order to Grasp (an otherwise unreachable) ball in its playground...|$|R
5000|$|The rest of 1998 {{included}} more {{growth for the}} young promotion. [...] "We guarantee excitement" [...] and [...] "blood is better" [...] quickly became two trademark slogans for the up-and-coming promotion. Charity Hall continued to sell out crowds for each and every show JAPW put on there. Along with the sell out crowd, JAPW brought in top talent and showcased local undiscovered talent that became stars. Also during that time, the shows became increasingly more violent in nature with more blood and weapons. Death matches became commonplace in JAPW with every show featuring such weapons as barbed wire, thumbtacks, fire, mouse <b>traps,</b> light <b>tubes,</b> and other weapons became standard. Glenn [...] "The Maniac" [...] Strange, [...] "Lightning" [...] Lou Diamond, Kane [...] "D", Homicide, Jay Lover, and Low Life Louie led the way with their extreme, hardcore, and brutal style.|$|R
