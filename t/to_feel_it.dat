5|$|Furious {{that her}} ploy has failed, Kundry tells Parsifal {{that if he}} can feel {{compassion}} for Amfortas, then {{he should be able}} <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> for her as well. She has been cursed for centuries, unable to rest, because she saw Christ on the cross and laughed at His pains. Now she can never weep, only jeer, and she is enslaved to Klingsor as well. Parsifal rejects her again but then asks her to lead him to Amfortas. She begs him to stay with her for just one hour, and then she will take him to Amfortas. When he still refuses, she curses him to wander without ever finding the Kingdom of the Grail, and finally calls on her master Klingsor to help her.|$|E

Once in a while I would have to rise up and offer myself for an {{interview}} so they wouldn't beat the door down.

500|$|An early draft had Hess {{surrounded}} by others sitting squarely around him. Hess felt the depiction {{had a more}} natural look, Rockwell objected, [...] "It was too diverse, it went every which way and didn't settle anywhere or say anything." [...] He felt the upward view from the bench level was more dramatic. Rockwell explained to Yates at The Post {{that he had to}} start Freedom of Speech from scratch after an early attempt because he had overworked it. Twice he almost completed the work only <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> was lacking. Eventually, he was able to produce the final version with the speaker as the subject rather than the assembly. For the accompanying essay, Post editor Ben Hibbs chose novelist and dramatist Tarkington who was a Pulitzer Prize winner. People who purchased war bonds during the Second War Bond Drive received a full-color set of reproductions of the Four Freedoms that had a commemorative cover with Freedom of Speech on it.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Goodlife, a {{professor}} of geological sciences at the University of Alabama, believes the state is at [...] "high" [...] risk from earthquakes. He claims that [...] "If there is an earthquake {{in one of the}} zone areas, North Alabama is certainly going <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it.</b> There's going to be damage and some perhaps major. If one occurred in the zone close to Memphis, it would be devastating because buildings are not made to withstand earthquakes. Places like San Francisco are aware of earthquake risks and structures are built to withstand them." [...] By his definition, the state's earthquakes are [...] "insignificant". Emergency planner Bill Thomison feels skeptical about a major earthquake, stating, [...] "I don't believe there are any major faults (interface of rocks) here. It depends on the magnitude of the earthquake and the Richter scale. You could have a No. 4 (magnitude) earthquake in California and not damage anything, but the same type in New York could be devastating because the building codes don't factor in earthquakes." ...|$|E
500|$|The idea to {{construct}} a bridge in the area did not arise until the 20th Century. In 1900 and 1901, politicians started <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> was appropriate to build a bridge in the area. A firm, run by Milton L. Skinner, first opened in 1901 to help sell stock, construct the bridge, and then follow it by operating it for the general public. The firm, named the Milanville Bridge Company, was located {{in the community of}} Milanville on the Pennsylvania side. At the time the name of the bridge was referred to as the Milanville Bridge, but eventually, locals referred it as the [...] "Skinners Falls Bridge". [...] The corporation received the charter from the state of Pennsylvania {{to construct}} the bridge in the later months of 1901. The firm hired the American Bridge Company to construct the bridge. Construction did not get far, before an ice flood raised the river to the second story level of Milanville homes. This, along with local opposition, caused a short delay in construction.|$|E

500|$|Uematsu was {{personally}} {{very pleased with}} the way that the soundtrack for Final Fantasy VI turned out, and has said in interviews that he felt that [...] "with the satisfaction and excitement I felt after finishing that project, I thought I had reached my primary goal, and could quit doing game music with no regrets." [...] He stated in the liner notes for Piano Collections Final Fantasy VI that he intended the music to be emotionally moving, and entreated the listener {{not to think about the}} music, but <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it.</b> He also feels that the title track for Final Fantasy VI was the most challenging track he has ever made. As for Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale, on the other hand, Uematsu has said that he was [...] "not satisfied with this album at all", due to the deviation it took from his original visions for the music due to his lack of personal involvement in the arrangements. Although he did not feel that the album was a poor one, saying that if he said nothing no one would ever know of his dissatisfaction, he felt that it was not what he would have created if he had [...] "defend the image of each piece".|$|E
500|$|Following its release, {{multiple}} critics {{found that}} the lyrics alluded to her turbulent high profile relationship with Canadian recording artist Justin Bieber. However, Gomez insisted that the song wasn't about [...] "one specific person". During an interview with Nicole Mastrogiannis of iHeartRadio, the singer explained {{the meaning of the}} album track-by-track, saying that [...] "Sober" [...] was about being blinded by love in an unhealthy relationship: [...] "It's easy to run away from your feelings, but I have to understand, and people need to understand, that {{you have to go through}} everything. You have <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it.</b> You gotta get through the other side as best as you can, and everyone has been in that situation where you can't help it. Even if it's not even that, it's like love drunk in a way." [...] In her analysis of the song, Alexis Rhiannon of Bustle wrote that [...] "as soon as [...] heard those lyrics, my brain started racing through the options of who this could be? Could it be about Justin Bieber, like I'm almost sure [...] "Camouflage" [...] is?" [...] Richard Braxter of Popology Now expressed doubt over Gomez's claims that the song wasn't about someone specific, saying: [...] "We’re sure there’s some weight to that, but we can’t help but think there’s some hints of Justin Bieber in this track." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{managing}} editor, Sam Moskowitz, {{also had}} a long history in the field, having helped organize the First World Science Fiction Convention in 1939. [...] He too had strong views about what constituted good science fiction, though his views did not always coincide with those of his publisher: Gernsback's focus was on the educational potential of sf, while Moskowitz was a fan of the early writers in the field, from before the Golden Age. [...] Moskowitz was the one in charge of obtaining stories, and he succeeded in acquiring work by many of the best-known names in sf, including Clifford Simak, Murray Leinster, Robert Bloch, James H. Schmitz, and Philip José Farmer, but he also bought many stories by writers from {{the early years of the}} genre, such as Raymond Gallun, Eando Binder, and Harry Bates. [...] The result was a magazine that both Ashley and fellow sf historian Donald Lawler describe as old-fashioned, despite its smart appearance: in Ashley's words, Science-Fiction Plus had [...] "a feeling of archaism", and he adds [...] "for a magazine to be 'slick', it didn't just have to look slick, it had <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it,</b> but in the case of Science-Fiction Plus all that glittered clearly was not gold". [...] Lawler agrees, describing the magazine as [...] "an anachronism", and [...] "dull from first to last". [...] As part of Gernsback's attempt to encourage stories that contained plausible scientific predictions, he created a symbol made up of a sphere labeled [...] "SF", with a five-pointed star atop it. [...] He placed the first of these awards on a story of his own, [...] "Exploration of Mars", in the first issue, in what Lawler describes as [...] "a characteristic self-tribute".|$|E

2500|$|Critics {{have argued}} that {{forgiveness}} interventions may actually cause an increase in negative affect because {{it is trying to}} inhibit the individual's own personal [...] feelings towards the offender. This can result in the individual feeling negatively towards themselves. This approach is categorizing the individual's feelings by implying that the negative emotions the individual is feeling are unacceptable and feelings of forgiveness is the correct and acceptable way <b>to</b> <b>feel.</b> <b>It</b> might inadvertently promote feelings of shame and contrition within the individual.|$|E

2500|$|At age eight, Clarkson {{was first}} {{inspired}} {{to venture into}} music {{during a visit to}} an African-American church in Fort Worth.

She cited soul singer Aretha Franklin as her major influence.

Other soul acts who influenced Clarkson were Mariah Carey, Etta James, Stevie Wonder, and Whitney Houston. Clarkson was also influenced by rock acts such as Radiohead, Garbage, Aerosmith, and Jimi Hendrix as her influences. She has also listed Reba McEntire, Bette Midler, and Rosemary Clooney.

2500|$|Krauthammer {{has said}} of his writing {{in support of the}} Reagan Doctrine, [...] "I {{basically}} came to the conclusion ... the Soviets had overextended their empire, and they were getting what the West had gotten with its overextended empire decades before a reaction, they got a rebellion, they got resistance. And the Soviets were now beginning <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it,</b> and the genius of Reagan, although I don’t think they had a plan in doing this is he instinctively realized that one of the ways to go after the Soviets was indirect, and that is you go after their proxies, you go after their allies, you go after their clients, or even in Afghanistan you go after them directly. So that’s what I called the Reagan Doctrine, it was sort of the opposite of the Brezhnev Doctrine, which was whatever we control we keep. And Reagan was saying, no you don’t." ...|$|E
