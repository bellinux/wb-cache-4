50|$|The {{aromatic}} polyurethane and urea type crosslinker {{is one of}} {{the significant}} reasons why many cathodic electrocoats show high levels of protection against corrosion. Of course {{it is not the only}} reason, but if one compares electrocoating compositions with aromatic urethane crosslinkers to analogous systems containing aliphatic urethane crosslinkers, consistently systems with aromatic urethane crosslinkers perform significantly better. However, coatings containing aromatic urethane crosslinkers generally do not perform well in terms of UV light resistance. If the resulting coating contains aromatic urea crosslinks, the UV resistance will be considerably worse than if only urethane crosslinks can occur. A disadvantage of aromatic urethanes is that they can also cause yellowing of the coating itself as well as cause yellowing in subsequent topcoat layers. A significant undesired side reaction which occurs during the baking process produces aromatic polyamines. Urethane crosslinkers based on toluene diisocyanate (TDI) can be expected to produce <b>toluene</b> <b>diamine</b> as a side reaction, whereas those based on Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate produce diaminodiphenylmethane and higher order aromatic polyamines. The undesired aromatic polyamines can inhibit the cure of subsequent acid catalysed topcoat layers, and can cause delamination of the subsequent topcoat layers after exposure to sunlight. Although the industry has never acknowledged this problem, many of these undesired aromatic polyamines are known or suspected carcinogens.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA {{reactive}} solvent {{composed of}} an epoxy resin and a liquid amine hardener {{was used to}} dissolve thermoplastic films in situ and produce composites modified by thermoplastics via resin transfer moulding (RTM). In order to overcome the high viscosity of the thermoplastic/resin solution, the thermoplastic, {{in the form of}} films, was placed between layers of fiber glass in the mould. It was intended that a thermoplastic/thermo set blend be generated in the interply regions after the following events had taken place: impregnation, dissolution of the films and a reaction induced phase separation of the thermoplastic (namely, polyether imide, PEI).

Despite curing above the melting point of EMAA (Tm = 85 °C), healing was facilitated by incorporating a preliminary low temperature curing step of 5 h at 80 °C, prior to epoxy cure at 150 °C. Healing was subsequently shown to occur at 130 °C, 150 °C and 200 °C via a pressure delivery mechanism derived from a condensation reaction between EMAA and the residual hydroxyl groups formed during epoxy cure. Healing was repeatable over 5 healing cycles despite a gradual reduction in efficiency, while efficiency increased with increasing healing temperature. Importantly, healing was evident at 130 °C, despite the epoxy network remaining in the glassy state at this temperature (Tg = 150 - 158 °C).

40|$|Asthma and allergy are a {{worldwide}} health problem {{and especially in}} industrialized countries their incidence has increased substantially. Allergic asthma is a chronic airway disease characterized by a reversible allergen-specific airway obstruction, airway inflammation and non-specific airway hyper-reactivity. In adults, 9 - 15 % of asthma cases {{can be attributed to}} occupational exposures and this makes occupational asthma the most frequent work-related lung disease. Occupational asthma can be caused by high molecular weight (pollen, flour, enzymes, ) as well as low molecular weight (chemicals, metals, resins, ) agents. Diisocyanates are chemical agents, used in isolation material, varnishes, spray paints, rubbers, etc., that frequently cause occupational asthma. The research unit of Lung Toxicology has succeeded in developing a mouse model that reflects several characteristics of chemical-induced asthma. Two dermal sensitizations followed by a single airway challenge with toluene diisocyanate resultedin a specific early airway response, followed by an airway inflammationwith an influx of neutrophils and a non-specific airway hyper-reactivity. Furthermore, we found an increase in T-helper, T-cytotoxicand B-lymphocytes in the draining lymph nodes as well as an increased in vitro production of the cytokines IL- 4, IFN-γ and an increase in total serum IgE. In this doctoral thesis we focused on: a/ Optimization of the mouse model b/ Validation of the mouse model c/ Unravel the mechanisms of chemical-induced asthma To optimize the mouse model, we attempted to obtain a chronic asthma modelby exposing the mice to repeated airway challenges. However,the multiple challenges did not result in a more chronic phenotype but induced instead a state of tolerance. Multiple intranasal instillations with toluene diisocyanate led to a full waning of the airway response and airway inflammation as well as a disappearance of immunologic parameters. Nevertheless, the humoral response was still increased after multiple challenges. Next, a further optimization was obtained by changing the challenge technique from intranasal instillation to oropharyngeal aspiration. Using the latter technique, wewere able to achieve a better exposure of the lower airways while bypassing the nose. Oropharyngeal aspiration appeared to be a goodalternative for intratracheal instillation without the drawbacks of thelatter. The use of this technique yielded, besides neutrophils, also an influx of eosinophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage. In alast step of the optimization we tested besides BALB/c mice, six other mouse strains in our mouse model. We concluded that BALB/c mice reproduce the characteristics of chemical-induced asthma most closely. Large differences could be found in bronchial reactivity, immunologic and humoral responses between the different mouse strains. Furthermore, no clear distinction can be made between more T-helper 1 or T-helper 2 prone mouse strains. The mouse model was validated by testing the potential dermal sensitization capacity and subsequent response to an airway challenge of <b>toluene</b> <b>diamine</b> and ammonium persulfate. We found that <b>toluene</b> <b>diamine,</b> produced when toluene diisocyanate reacts with water, is a weak dermal sensitizer and weak asthmogen and that there is no cross-reactivity between <b>toluene</b> <b>diamine</b> and toluene diisocyanate in our asthma model. Ammonium persulfate, a known cause of occupational asthma among hairdressers, appeared to be a moderate dermal sensitizer and to produce a robust response in our asthma model. These validation studies proved that our mouse model can be used to test less potent and even weak airway sensitizers. The mechanisms of chemical-induced asthma are still unclear. In an attempt to understand the mechanisms of this disease we developed an adoptive transfer protocol focusing on cellular responsesand used this to investigate the antibody-independent role of B-lymphocytes in chemical-induced asthma. The transfer of 0. 5 x 106 lymphocytes obtained from auricular lymph nodes of toluene diisocyanate sensitizedmice was sufficient to produce an asthma-like response in naïve mice after an airway challenge with toluene diisocyanate. Adoptive transfer experiments with B-lymphocytes into wild type, B knock-out and SCID miceresulted in airway hyper-reactivity and airway inflammation upon challenge with toluene diisocyanate. These data suggest an important antibody-independent role for B-lymphocytes in chemical-induced asthma. The optimization and validation of our mouse model of chemical-induced asthma has led to a better model that, in the future, could be used to identify potential asthmogens and to understand the mechanisms of action. A possibly important role for B-lymphocytes can bring a new insight into the mechanisms of non-atopic asthma. status: publishe...|$|E

The processed mixture was cured with diethyl <b>toluene</b> <b>diamine.</b> Three complimentary techniques were used to characterize the dispersion of the MWCNTs in cured composite samples: optical microscopy, micro Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). For sample MF þ PSM, optical micrographs and Raman images showed reduced agglomeration and a homogeneous distribution of MWCNTs in the epoxy matrix. SEM analysis of fractured specimen after tensile testing revealed breakage of nanotubes along the fracture surface of the composite. A comparison of the MWCNT dispersion in the epoxy samples processed using different methods showed that a combination of MF and PSM processing yields a more homogeneous sample than the PSM or US þ PSM processed samples. Mechanical testing of the composites showed about 15 % improvement in the tensile strength of samples processed by the MF þ PSM method over other methods. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results showed a small decrease in the onset degradation temperature for poorly dispersed samples produced by PSM compared with the well-mixed samples (MF þ PSM).

40|$|Isocyanates are {{reactive}} {{chemicals and}} thousands of workers may be exposed to them during their manufacture and use {{in a wide range}} of products. They are classed as sensitizers and are a major cause of occupational asthma in the UK. Workplace exposure limits are low and con-trol of exposure often depends on personal respiratory protection. Biological monitoring is in-creasingly used to assess exposure and the efficacy of control measures, including the behavioural aspects of controls. Biological monitoring methods are available for the most com-mon isocyanates hexamethylene diisocyanate, toluene diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, and methylenediphenyl diisocyanate. They are based on the analysis of hexamethylene di-amine, <b>toluene</b> <b>diamine,</b> isopherone diamine, and methylenediamine released after hydrolysis of isocyanate–protein adducts in urine or blood. Volunteer and occupational studies show good correlations between inhalation exposure to isocyanate monomers and isocyanate-derived di-amines in urine or blood. However, occupational exposure to isocyanates is often to a mixture of monomers and oligomers so there is some uncertainty comparing biological monitoring re-sults with airborne exposure to ‘total NCO’. Nevertheless, there is a substantial body of work demonstrating the utility of biological monitoring as a tool to assess exposure and the efficacy of controls, including how they are used in practice.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Toluene di-isocyanate (TDI) {{is widely}} used in the {{production}} of polyurethane foams and paints. As TDI causes respiratory disease in only a fraction of exposed workers, genetic factors may {{play a key role in}} disease susceptibility. Polymorphisms in TDI metabolising genes may affect elimination kinetics, resulting in differences in body retention, and in its turn differences in adverse effects. OBJECTIVES: To analyze how genotype modifies the associations between (i) TDI in air (2, 4 -TDI and 2, 6 -TDI) and its metabolites <b>toluene</b> <b>diamine</b> (TDA; 2, 4 -TDA and 2, 6 -TDA) in hydrolyzed urine; and (ii) 2, 4 -TDA and 2, 6 -TDA in hydrolyzed plasma and 2, 4 -TDA and 2, 6 -TDA in urine. METHODS: Workers exposed to TDI were analyzed for 2, 4 -TDI and 2, 6 -TDI in air (N= 70), 2, 4 -TDA and 2, 6 -TDA in hydrolyzed urine (N= 124) and in plasma (N= 128), and genotype: CYP 1 A 1 * 2 A, CYP 1 A 1 * 2 B, GSTA 1 - 52, GSTM 1 O, GSTM 3 B, GSTP 1 I 105 V, GSTP 1 A 114 V, GSTT 1 O, MPO- 463, NAT 1 * 3, * 4, * 10, * 11, * 14, * 15, NAT 2 * 5, * 6, * 7, and SULT 1 A 1 R 213 H. RESULTS: GSTP 1 105 strongly modified the relationship between 2, 4 -TDA in plasma and in urine: ValVal carriers had about twice as steep regression slope than IleIle carriers. A similar pattern was found for 2, 6 -TDA. CYP 1 A 1 * 2 A, GSTM 1, GSTP 1, GSTT 1, and MPO possibly influenced the relationship between TDA in plasma and urine. CONCLUSION: Our results show, for the first time, genetic modification on the human TDI metabolism. The findings suggest that GSTP 1 genotype should be considered when evaluating biomarkers of TDI exposure in urine and plasma.

40|$|This thesis covers {{sampling}} and analytical procedures for isocyanates (R-NCO) and amines (R-NH 2), {{two kinds of}} chemicals frequently used {{in association with the}} polymeric material polyurethane (PUR). Exposure to isocyanates may result in respiratory disorders and dermal sensitisation, and they are one of the main causes of occupational asthma. Several of the aromatic diamines associated with PUR production are classified as suspected carcinogens. Hence, the presence of these chemicals in different exposure situations must be monitored. In the context of determining isocyanates in air, the methodologies included derivatisation with the reagent di-n-butylamine (DBA) upon collection and subsequent determination using liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectrometric detection (MS). A user-friendly solvent-free sampler for collection of airborne isocyanates was developed as an alternative to a more cumbersome impinger-filter sampling technique. The combination of the DBA reagent together with MS detection techniques revealed several new exposure situations for isocyanates, such as isocyanic acid during thermal degradation of PUR and urea-based resins. Further, a method for characterising isocyanates in technical products used in the production of PUR was developed. This enabled determination of isocyanates in air for which pure analytical standards are missing. Tandem MS (MS/MS) determination of isocyanates in air below 10 - 6 of the threshold limit values was achieved. As for the determination of amines, the analytical methods included derivatisation into pentafluoropropionic amide or ethyl carbamate ester derivatives and subsequent MS analysis. Several amines in biological fluids, as markers of exposure for either the amines themselves or the corresponding isocyanates, were determined by LC-MS/MS at amol level. In aqueous extraction solutions of flexible PUR foam products, <b>toluene</b> <b>diamine</b> and related compounds were found. In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates the usefulness of well characterised analytical procedures and techniques for determination of hazardous compounds. Without reliable and robust methodologies there is a risk that exposure levels will be underestimated or, even worse, that relevant compounds will be completely missed...|$|E
