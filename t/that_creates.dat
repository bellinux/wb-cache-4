5|$|Electromagnetic articulography (EMA) is {{a method}} of {{measuring}} the position of parts of the mouth. EMA uses sensor coils placed on the tongue {{and other parts of}} the mouth to measure their position and movement over time during speech and swallowing. Induction coils around the head produce an electromagnetic field <b>that</b> <b>creates,</b> or induces, a current in the sensors in the mouth. Because the current induced is inversely proportional to the cube of the distance, a computer is able to analyse the current produced and determine the sensor coil's location in space.|$|E
5|$|If two {{disjoint}} smooth simple closed curves {{undergo the}} curve-shortening flow simultaneously, they remain disjoint as the flow progresses. The reason is that, if two smooth curves {{move in a}} way <b>that</b> <b>creates</b> a crossing, then {{at the time of}} first crossing the curves would necessarily be tangent to each other, without crossing. But, in such a situation, the two curves' curvatures at the point of tangency would necessarily pull them apart rather than pushing them together into a crossing. For the same reason, a single simple closed curve can never evolve to cross itself. This phenomenon is known as the avoidance principle.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two basic}} {{aerodynamic}} models of insect flight. Most insects use a method <b>that</b> <b>creates</b> a spiralling leading edge vortex. Some very small insects use the fling and clap or Weis-Fogh mechanism in which the wings clap together above the insect's body and then fling apart. As they fling open, the air gets sucked in and creates a vortex over each wing. This bound vortex then moves across the wing and, in the clap, acts as the starting vortex for the other wing. Circulation and lift are increased, {{at the price of}} wear and tear on the wings.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{structures}} of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are very different, at least some functions are interrelated. The proteins made by both genes are essential for repairing damaged DNA (see Figure of recombinational repair steps). BRCA2 binds the single strand DNA and directly interacts with the recombinase RAD51 to stimulate strand invasion a vital step of homologous recombination. The localization of RAD51 to the DNA double-strand break requires the formation of BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 complex. PALB2 (Partner and localizer of BRCA2) can function synergistically with a BRCA2 chimera (termed piccolo, or piBRCA2) to further promote strand invasion. These breaks {{can be caused by}} natural and medical radiation or other environmental exposures, but also occur when chromosomes exchange genetic material during a special type of cell division <b>that</b> <b>creates</b> sperm and eggs (meiosis). Double strand breaks are also generated during repair of DNA cross links. By repairing DNA, these proteins play a role in maintaining the stability of the human genome and prevent dangerous gene rearrangements that can lead to hematologic and other cancers.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the various}} {{patterns}} and motifs found in Delian mosaics is the triple-colored lozenge <b>that</b> <b>creates</b> a three-dimensional illusion of cubes in perspective for the viewer. This pattern appears in fifteen different locations, {{making it one}} of the most common. Other motifs include waves and stepped triangles, while major themes include maritime, theatrical, natural, or mythological objects and figures. The single wave pattern, a common motif in Hellenistic art, is the most predominant type of border design for mosaics at Delos and appear in mosaics of Arsameia (albeit arranged in the opposite direction). The rosette motif, which is found in the mosaics of various Hellenistic sites across the Mediterranean, is often coupled with single-wave borders in Delian mosaics. The typical Hellenistic palmette motif is used in a mosaic of Delos to fill the four corners around a central rosette motif. The illusion of three-dimensional relief in the figured scenes of Delian mosaics was usually achieved by the use of polychrome, with white, black, yellow, red, blue and green hues.|$|E
5|$|Michael Tolkin and David Hayter rewrote {{the script}} afterwards, despite {{positive}} {{response from the}} producers over France's script. Tolkin was brought in January 2000, while Hayter was brought in September of that year. Hayter's draft featured The Leader, Zzzax, and the Absorbing Man as the villains, who are depicted as colleagues of Banner and {{get caught in the}} same accident <b>that</b> <b>creates</b> the Hulk. Director Ang Lee and his producing partner James Schamus became involved with the film in January 20, 2001. Lee was dissatisfied with Hayter's script, and commissioned Schamus for a rewrite, merging Banner's father with the Absorbing Man. Lee cited influences from King Kong, Frankenstein, Jekyll and Hyde, Beauty and the Beast, Faust, and Greek mythology for his interpretation of the story. Schamus said he had found the storyline that introduced Brian Banner, thus allowing Lee to write a drama that again explored father-son themes.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} viral capsid enters the cell, an enzyme called reverse {{transcriptase}} liberates the single-stranded (+)RNA genome from the attached viral proteins and copies {{it into a}} complementary DNA (cDNA) molecule. The process of reverse transcription is extremely error-prone, and the resulting mutations may cause drug resistance or allow the virus to evade the body's immune system. The reverse transcriptase also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity <b>that</b> <b>creates</b> a sense DNA from the antisense cDNA. Together, the cDNA and its complement form a double-stranded viral DNA that is then transported into the cell nucleus. The integration of the viral DNA into the host cell's genome is carried out by another viral enzyme called integrase.|$|E
5|$|As {{a form of}} express trust, {{charitable}} trusts {{are subject}} to certain formalities, {{as well as the}} requirements of the three certainties, when being created. These vary depending on whether the gift <b>that</b> <b>creates</b> the trust is given in life, given after death, or includes land. If the gift is given after death through a will, the will must comply with Section 9 of the Wills Act 1837, which requires that the will be in writing and signed by the testator (or somebody else present, at the testator's instruction), {{it is clear that the}} testator intended to give effect to the will, and the signature is made or noted by two or more witnesses. If these are all carried out, the will is a valid document, and the gift made as part of it can create a charitable trust. If the gift is of land and made during the donor's lifetime, it must comply with Section 53(1)(b) of the Law of Property Act 1925, which requires that the agreement be a written document signed by the person giving it. If the gift is of personal property and made inter vivos, there are no formal requirements; it is enough that an oral declaration is made creating the trust. Once constituted properly, a charitable trust, like all express trusts, cannot be undone unless there is something allowing that within the trust instrument.|$|E
