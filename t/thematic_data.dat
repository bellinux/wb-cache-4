5000|$|Although {{thematic}} mapping first {{arose in the}} late 17th century, Borden Dent felt that “the significant, formative years {{in the development of}} portrayal techniques in thematic cartography were the first six decades of the nineteenth century.” [...] During this golden age of {{thematic mapping}}, the great majority of techniques used to depict <b>thematic</b> <b>data</b> were developed. These included “proportional point symbols, the line of equal value (isoline), the choropleth and shading, the dot method, class intervals, and flow lines.” [...] As the main cartographic tools for depicting <b>thematic</b> <b>data</b> had already been developed, much of Dent’s career was spent researching and examining ways in which the cartographer could better communicate with the map reader.|$|E

Any GAUL code is independent from the codes of its higher administrative levels. GAUL codes assigned to administrative units of a given country are not necessarily sequential numbers. The main benefit of the GAUL Coding System is that changing in the codes of an administrative unit might not imply a change of codes of the correspondent units at lower levels. This means that the effort to maintain the links between <b>thematic</b> <b>data</b> and associated administrative units is reduced to a minimum.|$|E

The increasing availability of massive <b>thematic</b> <b>data</b> related to urban {{areas such as}} socio-demographic data, traffic data, or real-estate data, raises the question how to get insight and how to effectively visualize contained information.

In particular, a rendering technique is explained that can efficiently represent and reconfigure the scene graph of a 3 D city model even for large-scale models. The resulting dynamic 3 D city models serve as general geovisualization tools to effectively analyze, explore, and present geometric and related thematic information of urban areas.

40|$|Since {{each of us}} is born somewhere, lives his/her {{adult life}} somewhere, and dies somewhere, genealogical data has a {{built-in}} spatial component. It is this spatial component that makes it possible to map the location/residence of an individual during his/her lifetime.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a national analysis of coastal land use change in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It compares {{a survey conducted}} by volunteers in 1965 with the 2014 update created using digital topographic data and aerial photography in an open source GIS. The paper reviews the origins and impacts of differences {{in the way that}} land use classes are measured and reported, and highlights a generic issue when comparing <b>thematic</b> <b>data.</b> This is, that <b>thematic</b> <b>data</b> are frequently subject to changes in the way that classes are conceived, measured and classified with the result that similarly named classes in different datasets may have very different spatial extents with very different meanings and underlying semantics, even when there is little difference in reality. The sources and nature of such variation in landscape conceptualisations are discussed and placed into the context of historical GIS (HGIS) analyses of thematic change. The critical issue is the need to separate actual differences on the ground from artefactual differences arising from methodological inconsistencies to support robust statistical analyses. A set of rubrics for updating historical <b>thematic</b> <b>data</b> is suggested to minimise the potential for such inconsistencies. These are applied to the National Trust's 1965 Neptune coastal land use survey and its 2014 update to quantify land use changes. The results describe the magnitude and direction of change, provide insights into the developmental pressures experienced at the coast and demonstrate the positive impacts of the Trust's management. Of potentially wider research interest to the HGIS and related research communities is the consideration of methods for mapping and quantifying thematic and areal changes. This is an underdeveloped research area in HGIS, when compared with the extensive methods for dealing with counts and boundary changes (e. g. census areas), but one that is critical for robust analysis of historical cartographic data...|$|E

40|$|Field {{studies and}} {{analysis}} of LANDSAT <b>Thematic</b> Mapper <b>data</b> in the Gran Desierto, Mexico may shed light on a technique to distinguish active from inactive (relict) sand surfaces.

The reasons for the albedo difference between active and inactive sands are reviewed and the mixing model of Johnson et al. is examined for tracing the provenance of sands based on albedo and spectral variations. Portions of the wavelengths covered by the Mars Orbiter correspond to the <b>Thematic</b> Mapper <b>data.</b> The identification of active sands on Earth, with a priori knowledge of bulk composition and grain size distribution, may allow the remote mapping of active sand surfaces on Mars.
