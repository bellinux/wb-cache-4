5|$|In {{his final}} period, Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and {{completed}} three more major plays: Cymbeline, The Winter's Tale, and The Tempest, {{as well as}} the collaboration, Pericles, Prince of Tyre.

Some commentators have seen this change in mood as evidence of a more serene view of life on Shakespeare's part, but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day.

5|$|Krichell is {{considered}} one of the greatest scouts in baseball history.
