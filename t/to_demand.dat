30|$|If {{it holds}} {{for a single}} country i that s_Z_i^·,OUT/s_F_i^·,OUT> 1 then a {{relatively}} larger proportion of its C&T-outflows is directed toward the intermediate <b>demand</b> sector than <b>to</b> final <b>demand,</b> which means a country {{is expected to be}} closer to the production of intermediate <b>demand</b> than <b>to</b> final <b>demand</b> C&T-goods. On the contrary, if s_Z_i^·,OUT/s_F_i^·,OUT< 1 and hence, C&T-outflows are to a larger extent final demand C&T-goods then a country’s distance <b>to</b> final <b>demand</b> is smaller than <b>to</b> intermediate <b>demand.</b> Similar <b>to</b> an idea put forth by De Backer and Miroudot (2013), the higher the distance <b>to</b> final <b>demand,</b> the more a country i is involved in C&T-production activities which are located upstream; whereas the closer a country i is <b>to</b> final <b>demand</b> the more it is specialized on downstream C&T-production activities. Changes in values of partial out-strength centralities over time then indicate shifts in the distance to final demand: If the gap <b>to</b> final <b>demand</b> shrinks then a country moves into a downstream direction, and vice versa this indicates a move into an upstream direction.|$|R
