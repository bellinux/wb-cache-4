25|$|Commercial egg substitutes, such as Bob's Red Mill egg {{replacer}} and Ener-G egg replacer, {{are available}} for cooking and baking. The protein in eggs thickens when heated and binds other ingredients together. Flaxseeds will do the same: replace each egg with one tablespoon of flaxseed meal mixed with three tablespoons of water. For pancakes a tablespoon of baking powder can be used instead of eggs. Other ingredients include (to replace one egg): one tablespoon of soy flour and one tablespoon of water; a quarter cup of mashed bananas, mashed prunes or apple sauce; or in batter two tablespoons of white flour, half a <b>tablespoon</b> of vegetable <b>oil,</b> two <b>tablespoons</b> of water, and half a tablespoon of baking powder. Silken (soft) tofu and mashed potato can also be used. Recently, aquafaba has come into use as a popular egg replacement, it can even be whipped up like egg whites.|$|R
50|$|A basic cacciatore recipe usually {{begins with}} a couple of <b>tablespoons</b> of olive <b>oil</b> heated in a large frying pan. Chicken parts, dusted with salt and pepper, are seared in the oil for three to four minutes on each side. The chicken is removed from the pan, and most of the fat poured off. The {{remaining}} fat is used to fry the onions, peppers or other vegetables for several minutes. A small can of peeled tomatoes (drained of liquid and chopped coarsely) is typically added to the pan along with rosemary and a half cup of dry red wine. Bay leaf may be used, along with chopped carrot to give extra sweetness. The seared chicken parts are returned to the pan which is then covered. The dish is done after about an hour at a very low simmer. Cacciatore is often served with a rustic bread or pasta on the side.|$|R
40|$|Maize or corn (Zea mays L.) is an {{important}} cereal crop of the world. It {{is a source of}} nutrition as well as phytochemical compounds. Phytochemicals play {{an important}} role in preventing chronic diseases. It contains various major phytochemicals such as carotenoids, phenolic compounds, and phytosterols. It is believed to have potential anti-HIV activity due to the presence of Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) lectin or GNA-maize. A <b>tablespoon</b> of maize <b>oil</b> satisfies the requirements for essential fatty acids for a healthy child or adult. Decoction of maize silk, roots, leaves, and cob are used for bladder problems, nausea, vomiting, and stomach complaints. Zein an alcohol-soluble prolamine found in maize endosperm has unique novel applications in pharmaceutical and nutraceutical areas. Resistant starch (RS) from maize reduces the risk of cecal cancer, atherosclerosis, and obesity-related complications.

50|$|Early {{pressure}} cookers {{equipped with}} only a primary safety valve risked explosion from food blocking the release valve. On modern pressure cookers, food residues blocking the steam vent or the liquid boiling dry will trigger additional safety devices. Modern pressure cookers sold from reputable manufacturers have sufficient safety features to prevent the pressure cooker itself from exploding. When excess pressure is released by a safety mechanism, debris of food being cooked may also be ejected with the steam—which is loud and forceful. This can be avoided if the pressure cooker is regularly cleaned and maintained {{in accordance with the}} manufacturer's instructions and never overfilled with food and/or liquid: a pressure cooker should never be filled more than two-thirds full with solid food, half full for liquids and foods that foam and froth (e.g., rice, pasta), and no more than one-third full for pulses (e.g., lentils). Adding a <b>tablespoon</b> of cooking <b>oil</b> minimises foaming.|$|R
5000|$|In Sri Lanka, {{probably}} the most popular type of roti is pol roti (coconut roti), made of wheat flour, kurakkan flour, or a mixture of both, and scraped coconut. Sometimes, chopped green chillies and onion {{are added to the}} mixture before cooking. These are usually thicker and harder than other roti types. They are usually eaten with curries, or some types of sambol or lunu miris and considered a main meal rather than a supplement.Another variety of roti popular in Sri Lanka is Kottu roti. Kottu roti is made up of paratha or godamba roti [...] Paratha/godamba roti is cut into small pieces. These pieces are small in size and rectangular or square in shape. Then on a square heating pan, vegetables, onions are allowed to be fried. Then eggs, cooked meat or fish are added to fried vegetables and allowed to be heated for a few minutes. Finally the pieces of cut paratha is added. All these ingredients are mixed using two square pieces of steel. A peculiar sound is deliberately made while the mixing is done. It is said that the first person who innovated kottu roti to save the remaining paratha at his restaurant made this noise to attract patrons to make them aware of the new delicacy. Depending upon what ingredients are used, there are vegetable, egg, chicken, beef, mutton and fish kottu roti.Godamba roti is another variety of roti that is found in many restaurants in Sri Lanka.

40|$|Most {{rural areas}} in {{developing}} countries these days are subjected to increasing population densities. The extra food requirement strains still further the already depleted fertility of the soil. As incomes fall demand for cheap staples rises. More and more farmers are cultivating cassava in increasing quantities because it can grow even under harsh agronomic conditions. However, on its own cassava flour provides little or no protein; {{it needs to be}} enriched by the addition of some protein source. In Cameroon, trials conducted at the Rural Training Centre, Mfonta, have succeeded in creating a recipe integrating soyabean-flour into gari and make-banana, whilst still maintaining the original taste. To prepare the improved gari 10 kg of grated cassava is mixed with 1 to 1. 2 ka of fine soyabean flour. First the soyaflour is mixed with 2, 5 litres of water and a teaspoon of palm-oil, brought slowly to the boil and simmered for about 10 minutes (care should be taken to avoid burning). The thick mixture should then be covered and cooled to hand heat, after which the grated cassava can be added. Six <b>tablespoons</b> of palm <b>oil</b> can also be added to give it a good colour. This mixture should then be allowed to ferment for between 12 - 24 hours, after which it can be cooked according to choice. The enriched Mfonta-Gari contains 8 - 10 % protein. Hans Schar Presby.
