5|$|Just before 05:00, as his rebels {{continued}} their search, Major Hatanaka {{went to the}} NHK studios, and, brandishing a pistol, <b>tried</b> <b>desperately</b> <b>to</b> get some airtime to explain his actions.

5|$|On this occasion, {{an unknown}} number of fire engines were either wheeled or dragged through the streets, some from across the City. The piped water had already failed which they were {{designed}} to use, but parts of the river bank could still be reached. Gangs of men <b>tried</b> <b>desperately</b> <b>to</b> manoeuvre the engines right up to the river to fill their reservoirs, and several of the engines toppled into the Thames. The heat from the flames by then was too great for the remaining engines to get within a useful distance; they could not even get into Pudding Lane.|$|E

25|$|In {{the decades}} after 1868, {{escalating}} economic difficulties weakened the state's dominance over the coastal indigenous population.

25|$|There were 36 {{people from}} North Albania who {{traveled}} from Shkodër to Vlorë {{carried in a}} closed van to Dhërmi. Each of them had paid 1500 euros to the traffickers in order to pass illegally to Italy's southern coasts. They embarked with two dinghy drivers and one trafficker, setting out at around 17:30 from the northern coasts of Dhërmi village on the stormy afternoon of 9 January, after it became completely dark. Half an hour after their departure both of the boat's motors stopped, possibly because of the over-load of passengers, {{as well as the}} difficult sea conditions. Returning was impossible. They were trapped by the sea that had a force of 6 on the Beaufort scale, despite being just 3 miles from Karaburun Peninsula's western shores. One of the motors started leaking fuel, burning some passengers. The people on board <b>tried</b> <b>desperately</b> <b>to</b> call their relatives and the police for help, and at 21:30 one of the dinghy drivers called Top-Channel TV. The boat filled with water but did not sink. Some passengers could not endure the cold and the burns and eventually died.|$|E
25|$|In {{the seventeenth}} year of Agrippa's reign (corresponding with the 12th year of Nero's reign), Agrippa <b>tried</b> <b>desperately</b> <b>to</b> avert {{a war with}} Rome, when he saw his countrymen {{generally}} disposed to fight against Rome, because of certain insults and abuses they had had under the Roman procurator, Gessius Florus. At this time, they had broken-off the cloisters leading from Antonia Fortress to the Temple Mount where Roman soldiers were wont to keep guard during the Jewish holidays, and they refused to pay the tribute which was due to Caesar. Agrippa convened the people and urged instead that they tolerate the temporary injustices done to them and submit themselves to Roman hegemony. At length, Agrippa failed to prevent his subjects from rebelling, whereas, during a certain holiday when the Roman governor of Syria, Cestius Gallus, had passed through Judea to quell the rebellion, he was routed by Jewish forces. By 66 the citizenry of Jerusalem expelled their king, Agrippa, and his sister, Berenice, from Jerusalem. During the First Jewish-Roman War of 66–73, he sent 2,000 men, archers and cavalry, to support Vespasian, showing that, although a Jew in religion, he was entirely devoted to the Roman Empire. He accompanied Titus on some campaigns, and was wounded at the siege of Gamla. After the capture of Jerusalem, he went with his sister Berenice to Rome, where he was invested with the dignity of praetor and rewarded with additional territory.|$|E
25|$|The months {{following}} {{the acceptance of the}} Treaty saw a gradual progression to civil war. The split in Sinn Féin gradually deepened and the majority of the IRA hardened against accepting anything less than a full republic. Collins and de Valera <b>tried</b> <b>desperately</b> <b>to</b> find a middle course and formed a pact whereby Sinn Féin fought a General Election in June with a common slate of candidates. Despite this pact, the electorate voted heavily in favour of pro-Treaty candidates. On the day of the election, the draft Free State Constitution was published and rejected by the Anti-Treatyites as it was clearly not a republican document. Collins, forced to a decision, opted to maintain the Treaty position and the support of the British Government, and moved to suppress the Republican opposition that had seized the Four Courts in Dublin. The Civil War started on 28 June 1922, and the IRA was decisively defeated in the field over the following two months, being largely pinned back to Munster. In August 1922, both Griffith and Collins died in quick succession; the former of natural causes, the latter a few days later when ambushed by Republicans at Béal na Bláth. With de Valera now on the fringes as the nominal leader of the Anti-Treaty forces in the Civil War, the new dominion (which {{was in the process of}} being created but which would not legally come into being until December 1922) had lost all its most senior figures.|$|E

500|$|Sheriff Walker {{pleaded with}} news reporters {{covering}} the violence {{to send a}} message to the Alachua County Sheriff P. G. Ramsey to send assistance. Carloads of men came from Gainesville to assist Walker; many of them had probably participated in the Klan rally earlier in the week. W. H. Pillsbury <b>tried</b> <b>desperately</b> <b>to</b> keep black workers in the Sumner mill, and worked with his assistant, a man named Johnson, to dissuade the white workers from joining others using extra-legal violence. Armed guards sent by Sheriff Walker turned away black people who emerged from the swamps and tried to go home. W. H. Pillsbury's wife secretly helped smuggle people out of the area. Several white men declined to join the mobs, including the town barber who also refused to lend his gun to anyone. He said he did not want his [...] "hands wet with blood".|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{featurette}} {{published by}} HBO {{shortly after the}} airing of [...] "The Broken Man", series co-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss spoke {{about some of the}} thought process behind the motivations of the characters that were featured prominently in the episode. David Benioff began by speaking about Sandor [...] "the Hound" [...] Clegane, saying [...] "I think suffering a near death experience probably changes anyone, and that certainly has changed Sandor Clegane. He's a more thoughtful person than he was when we last saw him, he's probably more aware of his vulnerabilities, he knows how close he came to dying, and he's really thinking about his past in a way that he never had before." [...] Weiss continued, [...] "The unfortunate, ugly reality of the kind of pacifism that Ray is preaching is often suicidal when you're {{in the middle of the}} kind of world that they're all in. Something sad about the fact that this person who <b>tried</b> <b>desperately</b> <b>to</b> walk away from what he was is being given no real choice but to go full throttle back in the direction of what he really is, which is a killer." ...|$|E

2500|$|The unifying {{actions of}} the last Dacian king Decebalus (ruled 87–106 AD) were seen as {{dangerous}} by Rome. Despite {{the fact that the}} Dacian army could now gather only some 40,000 soldiers, Decebalus' raids south of the Danube proved unstopable and costly. In the Romans' eyes, the situation at the border with Dacia was out of control, and Emperor Domitian (ruled 81 to 96 AD) <b>tried</b> <b>desperately</b> <b>to</b> deal with the danger through military action. [...] But the outcome of Rome's disastrous campaigns into Dacia in AD 86 and AD 88 pushed Domitian to settle the situation through diplomacy.|$|E

2500|$|After he {{left the}} Disney studios, Driscoll's parents withdrew him from the Hollywood Professional School which served child movie actors, and {{sent him to the}} public Westwood University High School instead. There his grades dropped substantially, he was the target of ridicule for his {{previous}} film career, and he began to take drugs. He said later, [...] "The other kids didn't accept me. They treated me as one apart. I <b>tried</b> <b>desperately</b> <b>to</b> be one of the gang. When they rejected me, I fought back, became belligerent and cocky— and was afraid all the time."

2500|$|In 1938, Hutton {{had a brief}} {{affair with}} Howard Hughes in London at the Savoy Hotel, where Hughes spent several afternoons in Hutton's round satin bed.

Hutton later recalled that [...] "he saw I had difficulty reaching orgasm and <b>tried</b> <b>desperately</b> <b>to</b> make me do so the first time [...] [...] [...] thereafter pleasing himself and saying that I would not have one anyway.

2500|$|In 1895 Bunin {{visited the}} Russian capital {{for the first}} time. There he was to meet the Narodniks Nikolay Mikhaylovsky and Sergey Krivenko, Anton Chekhov (with whom he began a {{correspondence}} and became close friends), Alexander Ertel, and the poets Konstantin Balmont and Valery Bryusov. 1899 saw the beginning of Bunin's friendship with Maxim Gorky, to whom he dedicated his Falling Leaves (1901) collection of poetry and whom he later visited at Capri. Bunin became involved with Gorky's Znanie (Knowledge) group. [...] Another influence and inspiration was Leo Tolstoy whom he met in Moscow in January 1894. Admittedly infatuated with the latter's prose, Bunin <b>tried</b> <b>desperately</b> <b>to</b> follow the great man's lifestyle too, visiting sectarian settlements and {{doing a lot of}} hard work. He was even sentenced to three months in prison for illegally distributing Tolstoyan literature in the autumn of 1894, but avoided jail due to a general amnesty proclaimed {{on the occasion of the}} succession to the throne of Nicholas II. Tellingly, it was Tolstoy himself who discouraged Bunin from slipping into what he called [...] "total peasantification." [...] Several years later, while still admiring Tolstoy's prose, Bunin changed his views regarding his philosophy which he now saw as utopian.|$|E
