5|$|From {{the start}} of the production, Atlus staff saw Shin Megami Tensei as a chance to create a game with the company's brand on it. The staff saw it as a remake of the {{previous}} Megami Tensei game; because of this, they knew what was going <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> story, and the development went smoothly. The story went through multiple revisions, and many settings were inspired by the staff's personal lives. The character and demon designs were done by Kazuma Kaneko, who used mythical figures and multiple clothing styles in his designs. Reception and sales for the game have been highly positive, and its success helped launch Atlus as a developer and publisher, along with popularizing the Megami Tensei series.|$|E

25|$|Compared {{to other}} countries, the United Kingdom {{definition}} of a drought is much less severe. In Libya in the Sahel region, a drought is usually only recognized after two years without any measurable rainfall.

25|$|While {{peak demand}} in 2006 was below total {{installed}} capacity, it lay slightly above firm capacity. According to {{supply and demand}} projections by the World Bank, new generation capacity to be commissioned in the period 2007-2010 {{will not be enough}} to meet demand growth, which means that an energy shortfall is likely <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> near future.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, as the city's crime rates reached an all-time high, {{the station was}} {{considered}} very dangerous, with 11 crimes having taken place there in the year 1990, {{many of which were}} suspected <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tunnel. The tunnel was dimly lit, covered with graffiti, and strewn with garbage at the time. In September 2014, improvements started on the tunnel, which area residents had complained about. The tunnel, which had graffiti and was frequented by cyclists riding bikes illegally, was slated to get several murals and some new LED lighting.|$|E

25|$|The {{boundaries}} of the Brussels-Capital Region were determined from the 1947 language census data. This {{was the last time}} that some municipalities were converted from a monolingual Dutch into a bilingual municipality, and were joined with the Brussels agglomeration. The suggestive nature of the questions led massive protest in Flanders (especially around Brussels), causing it to be unlikely to ever have language-related census data again in Belgium. The result is that the Brussels-Capital region is now a lot smaller than the French influence around the capital, and that there's no place in Brussels for important infrastructure. Enlarging the territory of Brussels could potentially give it around 1.5million inhabitants, an airport, a bigger forest, and bring the Brussels Ringroad on Brussels territory. A large and independent status may help Brussels in its claim as the capital of the EU. However, this is highly unlikely <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> near future.|$|E
25|$|Concerns about The Barrier's {{instability}} due to volcanic, tectonic {{or heavy}} rainfall activity prompted {{the provincial government}} to declare the area immediately below it unsafe for human habitation in 1980. This led to the evacuation of the small resort village of Garibaldi nearby and the relocation of residents to new recreational subdivisions away from the hazard zone. Should The Barrier completely collapse, Garibaldi Lake would be entirely released and downstream damage in the Cheakamus and Squamish rivers would be considerable, including major damage {{to the town of}} Squamish and possibly an impact-wave on the waters of Howe Sound that would reach Vancouver Island. The landslide area {{is referred to as the}} Barrier Civil Defence Zone. Although landslides are unlikely <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> near future, warning signs are posted at the zone to make visitors aware of the potential danger and to minimize the chance of fatalities in the event of a slide. For safety reasons, BC Parks recommends visitors not to camp, stop or linger in the Barrier Civil Defence Zone.|$|E
25|$|Little {{is known}} about the mating habits and {{reproductive}} timing of the banded tunnelweb spider, as it has proven difficult to observe them mating inside their silk tunnel constructs. It is assumed that mating takes place inside the burrow of the female spider, although there are no reported sightings of the actual mating taking place. The actual mating of the spiders is assumed <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same fashion as it does with other closely related mygalomorphs. There has been one recorded sighting of the behaviors leading up to mating, although the actual mating was unsuccessful; it was observed that as the male approached the female’s burrow he outstretched his front pair of legs, exposing his reproductive organs, then whilst vibrating his outstretched legs he moved toward the female. In this instance the female was unresponsive to the male’s advances, and nothing eventuated from the encounter. When a female is impregnated she lays her eggs in early to mid summer, wrapping them in a loose silk egg sack that is stored near the entrance of her burrow. In approximately thirty days the spiderlings hatch and stay nearby in the mother's web before leaving to construct their own silky tunnel web close by. There is a lack of information on the actual lifespan of the spiders, although the lifespan of the males and females differ greatly. Once leaving their mother the males only have a matter of months to find a mate before they die, but females have been known to live up to six years in captivity, being able to moult their skin and reproduce multiple times.|$|E

500|$|The {{vitality}} of the empire at this point was such {{that the use of}} native auxilia in the Roman army did not apparently barbarise the military as some scholars claim was <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late empire. On the contrary, those serving in the auxilia [...] during this period frequently strove to Romanise themselves. They were granted Roman citizenship on retirement, granting them several social advantages, and their sons became eligible for service in the legions.|$|E

The age of small kingdoms had given way to large empires in this region. The Chalukya dynasty was established by PulakeshinI in 543. PulakeshinI took Vatapi (modern Badami in Bagalkot district, Karnataka) under his control and made it his capital. PulakeshinI and his descendants are referred to as [...] "Chalukyas of Badami". They ruled over an empire that comprised the entire state of Karnataka and most of Andhra Pradesh in the Deccan.|$|E

In particular, under oceanic plates the temperature rises more quickly with depth, beyond the range required for diamond formation at the depth required. The correct combination of temperature and pressure is only found in the thick, ancient, and stable parts of continental plates where regions of lithosphere known as cratons exist. Long residence in the cratonic lithosphere allows diamond crystals to grow larger.|$|E

Its porting to the PlayStation 2 was speculated in late August, with release date set to autumn in Japan, which was later confirmed by Sammy in the same month.
