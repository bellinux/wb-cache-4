25|$|Simpson now {{announced}} that his target {{would be a}} run a minute, an ordinary rate maybe in days gone, but a breakneck almost in the sixties, what with slow over-rates and so much accent on defence. Yet Australia, give or <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> achieved it, their captain leading the way with the highest opening stand ever, in a partnership with Lawry, for Australia against England: 244. I never remember seeing better running between wickets than of these two – and found myself comparing them, in fact, with Hobbs and Sutcliffe. With the field constantly changing over as right- and left-hander alternated, England, in much heat, sweated and chased unavailingly.|$|E

In a minute the {{faithful}} Jacques will escort Monsieur Tarzan into her presence without announcing him. It will <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> for explanations. Olga will look very alluring in the filmy creation that is her night-dress, and the clinging robe which but half conceals the charms that the former does not conceal at all. Olga will be surprised, but not displeased.|$|E
60|$|ANDERSON. That's well said. On those terms, sir, I {{will accept}} your enmity or any man's. Judith: Mr. Dudgeon will stay to tea. Sit down: it will <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> to draw by the fire. (Richard glances {{at him with}} a troubled face; then sits down with his head bent, to hide a convulsive {{swelling}} of his throat.) I was just saying to my wife, Mr. Dudgeon, that enmity-- (she grasps his hand and looks imploringly at him, doing both with an intensity that checks him at once) Well, well, I mustn't tell you, I see; but it was nothing that need leave us worse friend--enemies, I mean. Judith is a great enemy of yours.|$|E

50|$|A double-CD set, XX Years Live was {{recorded}} in March of that same year at the Copernicus Center Theatre in Chicago, to celebrate 20 years of music ministry. The concert features at least one song from every REZ release, and in addition, Glenn Kaiser {{and his wife and}} co-lead singer, Wendi Kaiser, <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> each to speak to the audience.|$|E
50|$|NC 901 is {{a viable}} {{alternate}} route between Mocksville and Wilkesboro; it is shorter in mileage, though <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> longer than via US 601 and US 421.|$|R
50|$|Stripping the {{membranes}}: Stripping the membranes only <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> {{and causes}} <b>a</b> <b>few</b> intense cramps. Many women report a feeling similar to urination, others report {{it to be}} quite painful.|$|R

50|$|The Simcoach Skill Arcade is Simcoach's {{most recent}} project {{and it is}} aimed at {{bringing}} engaging, consistent and practical game-based learning to the workforce {{through the use of}} mobile devices. By utilizing mobile devices in training, employees can <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> during slow periods at work or just before or after a break to freshen up on skills that are essential to their jobs.|$|E
50|$|Coin {{manipulation}} {{is the art}} of manipulating {{coins in}} skillful flourishes, usually on or around the hands. Although not always considered coin magic, the tricks are sometimes used in magic shows. The difficulty of the trick ranges greatly, from some that <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> to accomplish, to much more complex ones that can take months, even years, to master. One of the best-known tricks is the relatively advanced coin walk.|$|E
50|$|These {{batteries}} {{could allow}} electric cars to travel 500 miles before recharging. Replacing the liquid electrodes could only <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> while recharging batteries takes much longer. These batteries don't have {{the problems of}} short circuits and overheating. The downsides are that nanoparticles degrade quickly, the technology is new and needs more development, they {{need to focus on}} cheaper production, and refilling stations would cost a lot to build.|$|E
50|$|The S-125 is {{somewhat}} mobile, {{an improvement over}} the S-75 system. The missiles are typically deployed on fixed turrets containing two or four but can be carried ready-to-fire on ZIL trucks in pairs. Reloading the fixed launchers <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Scenes were {{filmed in}} {{sequence}} during the crew's personal time {{so as not}} to impact their work schedule in any way. The scenes were filmed over several days and thereby only <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> to set up and shoot sequences on any given day.|$|R

50|$|Schein {{describes}} the Process Consultant Role where the helper {{focuses on the}} communication process from the very beginning. Before help can start, {{there needs to be}} an establishment of trust between the helper and the client. For example, in order for a tech consultant to be effective, he or she has to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> to discuss what the situation is, how often the problem occurs, what has been tried before, etc. before transitioning into the expert role or the doctor role.|$|E
50|$|The game {{is divided}} into larger areas that are {{subdivided}} into multiple levels. Levels are short and generally only <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> to complete. The goal often involves defeating a set of enemies and activating switches {{in order to gain}} access to the level's exit. The puzzle elements in the first few levels combine to form more complex puzzles as the game progresses. There is also a level editor feature to allow players to create their own puzzles and share them on the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection network.|$|E
5000|$|On one {{business}} trip, {{she arrives}} at a town where the only available place to sleep is a bungalow reserved for married couples. When she is mistaken for the war bride of a lieutenant, she goes along. To register at the Colonial Auto Court, however, she has to produce her [...] "husband". She persuades a very reluctant Lieutenant Don Mallory (William Prince) to help her out, promising it will only <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> of his day off. The couple become trapped in their masquerade as newlyweds when they run into Don's commanding officer, Colonel Michael Otley (Sydney Greenstreet), who lives just {{a few doors down}} with his wife.|$|E
6000|$|She put {{out to him}} on {{this the}} hand he had <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> before, and he clasped it now only with the {{firmness}} it seemed to give and to ask for. [...] "Oh it will do for that!" [...] she said as they went out together.|$|R
50|$|One common {{method to}} avoid {{transshipment}} {{is to build}} cars to the smaller of the two systems' loading gauges with bogies that are easily removed and replaced, with other bogies at an interchange location on the border. This <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> per car, but is quicker than transshipment of goods.|$|R
50|$|It is used {{to clear}} plant or animal tissue samples of color, and as such is useful for {{microscopy}} and immunohistochemistry when excess pigments obscure structures or block light in the tissue being examined. This clearing generally only <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> but the tissue must first be dehydrated in alcohol.|$|R

50|$|After {{dinner is}} the Junior High Awards Ceremony. Since the 2013 State Meet onward, PJAS has stopped holding one massive Junior High Awards Ceremony in Eisenhower Auditorium due to time {{constraints}} with {{preparing for the}} Special Awards Ceremony. The large ceremony followed exactly the same process as the Senior High Awards Ceremony. Now, each region’s Junior High Award Ceremony in held different lecture halls across campus at the same time. Depending {{on the number of}} middle school students, this awards ceremony could <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> or could be over an hour long; it is less formal and much quicker than the senior high awards. Each middle school student’s name is called along with his/her award just like the senior high awards ceremony. Students receive a corresponding pin for their award and a certificate.|$|E
50|$|Leveling ends {{automatically}} {{when the}} computer decides that the platform stable element is exactly locally level, which may <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> If level, {{the final phase}} of alignment is switched on; gyrocompassing.The stable element is exactly level and Schuler-tuned but the gyros are not yet aligned with the earth rotation axis. Therefore the stable element tends to turn off-level, which is sensed by the Y accelerometer which signal is fed to the gyro torquer to rotate the azimuth axis of the stable element. This process continues for a few minutes until the correction signal is getting smaller and can be kept almost zero for 50 seconds, which gives confidence that the system is level and aligned. This is visible for the pilot because the green Nav light flashes.|$|E
5000|$|The Swift Glider: The Swift {{satellite}} {{is named}} for an agile bird that catches its food on the fly. This is a paper airplane designed {{to look like a}} Swift that you can build yourself.

50|$|In {{scheduled}} transportation, a layover (also way station, or connection) is a {{point where}} a vehicle stops, with passengers possibly changing vehicle. In public transit, this typically <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> at <b>a</b> trip terminal. For air travel, where layovers are longer, passengers will exit the vehicle and wait in the terminal.|$|R
50|$|Adult moths {{normally}} {{emerge from}} their cocoons in late morning or early afternoon. Eclosion (emergence from the cocoon) only <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> After eclosing, the moths climb and hang on plants {{so that their}} furled wings can be inflated with fluid (hemolymph) pumped from the body. This inflation process takes about twenty minutes.|$|R
