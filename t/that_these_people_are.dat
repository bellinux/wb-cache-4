500|$|In 1998, writer Tony Ortega wrote {{a lengthy}} investigative {{article for the}} Phoenix New Times for which he interviewed Boyer. Boyer {{said that he was}} uninterested in what others thought of the {{accuracy}} of what he had written. [...] "This is an artistic effort. I don't have to adhere to the kind of jacket <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> putting on me. I am not a historian. I'm a storyteller."Boyer admitted that the book is [...] "100 percent Boyer". He said the book was not really a first-person account, that he had interpreted Wyatt Earp in Josephine's voice, and admitted that he could not produce any documents to vindicate his methods.|$|E
500|$|... "Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over)" [...] was {{released}} {{as the lead}} single from the group's third studio album, On Top (1966), in February 1966. The album {{was a combination of}} [...] "current hits" [...] and [...] "crossover material" [...] to attract a larger audience for Four Tops. The song was written and produced by Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier, and Eddie Holland, who had collaborated with Four Tops on various occasions in the past. It is written in the key of C major with the quartet's vocals ranging from G4 to D6. Set in a gospel rock tempo, lead single Levi Stubbs begins stating, [...] "All through this long and sleepless night / I hear my neighbors talking"; after losing the love of someone else, he claims <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> [...] "Saying that, out of my life, into another's arms / You'll soon be walking," [...] before entering the chorus. The American female group the Andantes provide background vocals for the track.|$|E
500|$|The Government of Canada {{disagreed}} with Ontario's ruling {{and announced that}} the decision would be appealed. Falle helped the Crown formulate their case. That November, Falle was a panelist at a debate about the case. At the debate, which was hosted by the Queen's Law and Public Policy Club at Queen's University, Falle said that, whatever {{the outcome of the}} appeal, she was glad that the case was removing the taboos surrounding talking about prostitution. The following June, Falle and more than twelve others intervened in the case, arguing that the laws should be reinstated to protect women from pimps. As part of this anti-prostitution coalition, Falle said that all areas of the sex industry are unsafe, including escort agencies and strip clubs. Falle testified in the lower courts, saying that [...] "the more they say the women are there by choice, the harder it is for us to convince police, social workers and everyone else <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> vulnerable." [...] She also said that striking down anti-prostitution laws sends a message to men that it is acceptable to harass women. Falle said that all the applicants in Bedford v. Canadaincluding Terri-Jean Bedford, the dominatrix seeking to have the anti-brothel law struck downentered the sex industry as children. For this reason, Falle argued that neither of these women chose a life of prostitution as a consenting adult; that life had already been chosen for them by the time that they had reached the age of consent. Falle encouraged Canadians to take an interest in Bedford v. Canada because any Canadian girl can become a victim of prostitution.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "If there's {{anything}} that settles it firm {{in my mind}} <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>is</b> Christians, it's this bed of grass. I don't believe there ever was heathens that growed grass." ...|$|R
60|$|Now I {{went out}} and spoke to Mavovo, telling him to keep a good watch and {{to be sure that}} every man had his gun ready, as I thought <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> slave-traders and might attack us in the night.|$|R
2500|$|Section II, IV:12b-VII:9 it {{outlines}} {{the views of}} people in and outside the community, and discusses <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> straying from the real law. Meanwhile {{the people in this}} community are drawn together by the covenant, and strict laws they follow together. [...] It is said that people who follow this law will attain salvation.|$|E
2500|$|Boyer has {{admitted}} that the book is [...] "100 percent Boyer." [...] He {{said that he is}} uninterested in what others think of the accuracy of what he has written. [...] "This is an artistic effort. I don't have to adhere to the kind of jacket <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> putting on me. I am not a historian. I'm a storyteller."

2500|$|Sheeran {{performed}} a gig in Bristol, which raised £40,000 for a charity that {{reaches out to}} street sex workers. [...] "It's good to show insight <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> real people with real emotions and they deserve the same charity work as anyone else," [...] Sheeran said. [...] "There's a lot more popular charities that {{get a lot of}} attention. And with certain subjects like this they're often washed over and people don't necessarily give them the attention they deserve." [...] Tickets were available to those taking part in the charity's Give it up for One25 campaign by giving something up for 125 hours and hitting the £40,000 fundraising mark.|$|E
500|$|The Hebrew Bible {{mentions}} the Avvites occupying {{an area that}} extended as far as Gaza, and <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> dispossessed by the [...] Caphtorites from the island of Caphtor (modern Crete). Some scholars speculate that the Philistines were descendants of the Caphtorites.|$|R
60|$|Again Tommy {{felt that}} cold chill of uncertainty. It seemed {{impossible}} to believe <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> other than they seemed. Had he been fooled once more? The fair-bearded, spectacled gentleman who {{sat at the}} head of the table looked singularly honest and normal.|$|R
60|$|He departed. And Stephen glanced absently at the group. They {{were picking}} their {{way over the}} muddy {{crossing}} toward him.

2500|$|The film {{significantly}} {{differs from}} all other adaptations of Ramayana in the characterisation of the central characters, including Rama and Lakshmana. The characters are humanised, contrary to the way divine characters from Indian mythology are usually depicted in visual media. Rama has a pot belly, while Lakshmana has pockmarks on his face. In an interview, Aravindan stated, [...] "Our sculptures are large in size and exude strength and vitality, which is absent in murals. The Rama of Kanchana Sita exudes the strength and vitality of our sculptures. He {{is not just a}} plain frontal image. The wandering tribals we encounter here and there with their medicines also share this quality. I enquired and found <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> settled in villages near the Godavari River. Apart from this they also believe that they belong to the same race. That is why I cast two of them in my film." ...|$|E
2500|$|Orzack's {{continued}} {{research into}} computer game addiction started {{to focus on}} multiplayer computer games, such as The Sims, EverQuest and World of Warcraft. Describing one of her patients who was regularly missing college lessons and becoming violent, she said [...] "Something {{is going on in}} his life that he is escaping. In the game, he finds a sense of belonging. Some say escape and some say fun, but most {{want to be part of}} an organization." [...] Orzack then went on to say <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> roleplaying and feel part of an organisation, something they may lack outside of the game. She also stated that some patients have been known to take drugs in order to continue playing, making her feel that the addiction is worse than that of drink or drugs. Withdrawal from gaming is not something Orzack recommended, as she felt this could lead to depression and violence.|$|E

25|$|Part of the {{cemetery}} space has been surrounded with a dry-stone wall. Some tumuli were built beyond that wall; 8 corpses were found there.

"But I don't {{know that}} there is," [...] he went on remorselessly, [...] "and I do know <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> being robbed of {{something}} more than money, of all that makes life worth living.

"Excuse her," [...] he said; [...] "judge her indulgently; {{the glitter}} of fashion misleads her, {{but she will}} soon find out <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> hollow, and will return to you with {{augmented}} attachment and confirmed trust.

25|$|Believing <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> {{descendants}} of Israelites, Avichail named the group Bnei Menashe. He began {{to teach them}} normative Orthodox Judaism.

The Israeli government did not recognize the Messianic groups in India as candidates for aliyah.|$|R
60|$|Then King Arthur {{and those}} who were with him beheld that, at some {{distance}} away upon {{the other side of the}} meadow, there <b>were</b> three <b>people</b> sitting under a crab-apple tree upon a couch especially prepared for them, and they <b>were</b> aware <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> the chief of all that company.|$|R
5000|$|A Ukrainian {{historian}} argues <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> {{punished for}} {{their loyalty to}} the Russian language and culture, saying {{that the people who}} had renounced the Russian language and identified themselves as Ukrainians were released from the camp.

6000|$|... "There are {{hundreds}} of different ways. But, of course, if a sect doesn't tell it doesn't pay. Worship has moved with the times. There are high class sects with quieter ways--costly incense and personal attentions and all <b>that.</b> <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> extremely popular and prosperous. They pay several dozen lions for those apartments to the Council--to you, I should say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes." [...] Matt took a fresh grip of his friend's arm, {{and walked}} him {{steadily}} forward, and kept him walking {{in spite of}} his involuntary tendency to come to a halt every few steps, and try to urge something that he never quite got from his tongue, against the probability of what Matt was saying. [...] "I mean <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> right in their suspicions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{the thing}} is ridiculous!" [...] Mr. Tyritt declared. [...] "There are names here of princes, of bankers, of society women, many of them wholly and entirely English, some of them {{household}} names.

5000|$|AllMusic critic Andy Kellman, while {{noting the}} {{apparent}} {{influence of the}} Stooges, MC5 and Roxy Music, said, [...] "Despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> just getting used to playing with each other, most everything sounds assured, tight, and nearly professional.

60|$|For half {{a minute}} the ape-man stood noting distant {{landmarks}} that he judged {{might be in the}} vicinity of the fallen plane, for no sooner had he realized <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> again in trouble than his inherent sense of duty to his own kind impelled him once more to forego his plans and seek to aid them.|$|R
60|$|CAPTAIN SHOTOVER [throwing {{down his}} brush {{and coming to}} the end of the sofa]. Do not deceive yourself: they do use it. We kill the better half of {{ourselves}} every day to propitiate them. The knowledge <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> there to render all our aspirations barren prevents us having the aspirations. And when we are tempted to seek their destruction they bring forth demons to delude us, disguised as pretty daughters, and singers and poets and the like, for whose sake we spare them.|$|E
6000|$|Not <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> {{not doing}} {{all they can}} for me. I know that. I admit it.

5000|$|I {{found the}} town in great excitement; un-uniformed militia were parading the streets, both white and colored.
