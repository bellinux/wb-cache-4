5|$|At Production I.G, Hiroyuki Kitakubo {{directed}} the animation scenes, wrote the screenplay {{and did the}} storyboards; Toshihiro Kawamoto was animation supervisor and a character designer. The scenes are noticeably different {{when compared to the}} film namesake directed by Mamoru Oshii, because the game is colored using a full digital technique. The scenes are a combination of cel animation and backgrounds that were rendered in three dimensions to ensure smooth transitions for the camera movement.

5|$|Fearing {{a future}} {{government}} may overturn the statute enforcing property tax rate caps, Daniels {{and other state}} Republican leaders pressed for an amendment <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>the</b> new tax limits to the state constitution.

In November 2010, voters elected to adopt the tax caps into the Indiana Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Illinois {{initially}} {{applied for}} the new freeway to be designated Interstate37, but on December 7,1990, the request was deferred by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), pending approval by the Federal Highway Administration <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>the</b> freeway into the Interstate System. In addition, AASHTO suggested using a 3-digit number when the application was resubmitted. Later, the state submitted another application to AASHTO for the freeway to be named Interstate155. On June 9,1991, the AASHTO application was approved and granted when Interstate 155 was completed.|$|E

5|$|In 1880 the Burne-Joneses bought Prospect House in Rottingdean, near Brighton in Sussex, {{as their}} holiday home, {{and soon after}} the next door Aubrey Cottage to create North End House, {{reflecting}} {{the fact that their}} Fulham home was in North End Road. (Years later, in 1923, Sir Roderick Jones, head of Reuters, and his wife, playwright and novelist Enid Bagnold, were <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>the</b> adjacent Gothic House to the property, which became the inspiration and setting for her play The Chalk Garden).|$|E
5|$|In October 2008 President Fernández de Kirchner nationalised private {{pension funds}} for almost $30 billion, ostensibly {{to protect the}} {{pensions}} from falling stock prices around the world, although critics said the government simply wanted <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>the</b> money to its budget. Private pension funds, which were first licensed in 1994, suffered large losses during the 19982002 crisis and by 2008, the state subsidized 77% of the funds' beneficiaries.|$|E
5|$|Pirates of the Caribbean was {{the first}} film {{released}} under the Walt Disney Pictures banner to be rated PG-13 by the MPAA; one executive noted that she found the film too intense for her five-year-old child. Nonetheless, the studio was confident enough <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>The</b> Curse of the Black Pearl subtitle to the film in case sequels were made, and to attract older children. Verbinski disliked the new title {{because it is the}} Aztec gold rather than the ship that is cursed, so he requested the title to be unreadable on the poster.|$|E

5|$|The Norfolk and Western Railway {{was one of}} {{the twenty}} railroads which joined Amtrak in 1971 but in the first four years hosted no {{passenger}} service over its route, the centerpiece of which was its main line between Norfolk and Cincinnati which passed through the state of West Virginia. The main driving force behind the establishment of the Mountaineer was then-United States Senator Robert Byrd (D-West Virginia), who wanted additional rail service for his constituents and pressured the Department of Transportation <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>the</b> route.|$|E
5|$|After {{a trip to}} Singapore and Java, in the East Indies (present day Indonesia) in 1875, King Rama V {{brought back}} with him two Englishmen, the {{architect}} John Clunich and his helper Henry C. Rose to design and construct the Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall. Construction began on the 7 May 1876. At first the King wanted an entirely European structure with domes. However {{at the insistence of}} Chao Phraya Si Suriyawongse (Chuang Bunnag), his Chief Minister, the King decided <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>the</b> gilded spires and Thai roofs. In 1878 the King personally supervised the raising of the final central spire of the building. The throne hall was completed in 1882, on the centenary of the House of Chakri and the Grand Palace. Thus the new throne hall was given the name Phra Thinang Chakri, meaning literally 'the seat of the Chakris'.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the firm}} {{intention}} of Sandy Pearlman and Albert Bouchard {{to salvage the}} project, the recordings remained unfinished and untouched {{for more than two}} years due to lack of funding. While struggling with the long, complex and expensive production of the Blue Öyster Cult's album Club Ninja, Pearlman associated himself with Daniel J. Levitin, A director of the local punk label 415 Records, with whom shared academic interests in neuroscience. In 1986, Pearlman leased Studio C of San Francisco's Hyde Street Recording Studios, and dubbed it Alpha & Omega Studios. Pearlman and Levitin produced various bands there, and Pearlman sub-leased the studio to other producers. In September 1986, when the poor sales of Club Ninja resulted in a commercial failure and the group disbanded, the lack of new material from the band for the foreseeable future prompted Pearlman to propose Imaginos to Columbia Records as a new Blue Öyster Cult album. He obtained a small budget from the record label to remix the album and <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>the</b> vocals of Roeser and Bloom, singers of all the hits produced by Blue Öyster Cult.|$|E

5|$|In 1966, a {{small change}} {{was made to}} the design <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>the</b> {{initials}} of the designer (FS) to the obverse, underneath Jefferson's portrait. In commemoration of that change, two specimen 1966 nickels with the initials were struck and presented to him. Coins struck at any mint between 1965 and 1967 lack mint marks, which were omitted as the Mint replaced the silver circulating coins with copper-nickel. Beginning in 1968, mint marks were again used, and on the nickel were moved to {{the lower part of}} the obverse, to the right of Jefferson's bust. From 1971, no nickels were struck for circulation in San Francisco—the 1971-S was the first nickel struck in proof only since 1878.|$|E
5|$|In September 2008, Valve {{added support}} for Steam Cloud, {{a service that}} can {{automatically}} store saved game and related custom files on Valve's servers; users can access this data from any machine running the Steam client. Games must use the appropriate features of Steamworks for Steam Cloud to work. Users can disable this feature on a per-game and per-account basis. In May 2012, the service added the ability for users to manage their game libraries from remote clients, including computers and mobile devices; users can instruct Steam to download and install games they own through this service if their Steam client is currently active and running. Some games sold through retail channels can be redeemed as titles for users' libraries within Steam by entering a product code within the software. For games that incorporate Steamworks, users can buy redemption codes from other vendors and redeem these in the Steam client <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>the</b> title to their libraries. Steam also offers a framework for selling and distributing downloadable content (DLC) for games.|$|E
5|$|The Steam overlay {{shows the}} player's friends on both Steam and the PlayStation Network, with {{achievements}} rewarded for both Steam and PlayStation Network Trophies. Players can unlock {{the game on}} Steam for Windows and OS X for no additional charge. The integration of Steamworks on the PlayStation 3 allows Valve to collect data about problems that arise after shipping and push appropriate updates. Valve has stated they do not plan on integrating other PlayStation 3 features, such as 3D television or PlayStation Move support. In June 2012, Valve announced that the PlayStation 3 version would be patched later that year to include support for the PlayStation Move motion controller, and <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>the</b> additional content that was previously provided with the Hydra, under the name Portal 2 In Motion. The patch was released in early November 2012. A free co-op add-on for the Portal 2 In Motion content was added in June 2013. Valve said that despite additional support for PlayStation 3 over Xbox 360, the core game is the same on both platforms.|$|E

5|$|The first list {{fragment}} {{is followed}} by the canon tables of Eusebius of Caesarea. These tables, which predate the text of the Vulgate, were developed to cross-reference the Gospels. Eusebius divided the Gospel into chapters and then created tables that allowed readers to find where a given episode in the life of Christ was located in each of the Gospels. The canon tables were traditionally included in the prefatory material in most mediaeval copies of the Vulgate text of the Gospels. The tables in the Book of Kells, however, are almost unusable because the scribe condensed the tables {{in such a way as}} to make them confused. In addition, the corresponding chapter numbers were never inserted into the margins of the text, making it impossible to find the sections to which the canon tables refer. The reason for the omission remains unclear: the scribe may have planned <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>the</b> references upon the manuscript's completion, or he may have deliberately left them out so as not to spoil the appearance of pages.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the old {{characters}} in the Pokémon franchise, Mew's development was not overseen by Ken Sugimori, but by Game Freak programmer Shigeki Morimoto. Morimoto programmed Mew into the game secretly, as a prank amongst the staff just prior to its release in Japan, intending {{it to be a}} Pokémon only Game Freak staff members would know about and be able to obtain. Mew was added {{at the very end of}} the development of Pokémon Red and Blue after the removal of debug features, freeing up just enough space <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>the</b> character despite being told not to alter the game any further at this point. Though not intended by the developers to be obtainable, due to a glitch, players were able to encounter it.|$|E
