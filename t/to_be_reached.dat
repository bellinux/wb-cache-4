5|$|Behind {{the votes}} in {{parliament}} was a personal antagonism between Hall and Ren DeGaris, {{the leader of the}} LCL in the Legislative Council. DeGaris, who was elected to the council in 1962, was a staunch defender of its franchise and electoral boundaries. The two were the de facto leaders of the party's two factions; Hall represented the urban-based progressives, and DeGaris the rural-based conservatives. The conflict between the two extended beyond politics and on to a personal level, contributing to the polarisation of views within the LCL and making it difficult for an internal compromise <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> on the issue of electoral reform.|$|E

5|$|To sum up: The {{lines of}} {{cleavage}} between Pablo's revisionism and orthodox Trotskyism are {{so deep that}} no compromise is possible either politically or organizationally. The Pablo faction has demonstrated {{that it will not}} permit democratic decisions truly reflecting majority opinion <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reached.</b> They demand complete submission to their criminal policy.

5|$|After Babs {{passed the}} hardest hit areas, workers were {{initially}} unable to distribute food and medicine due to ferry service being halted. Many provinces and islands were isolated after the storm, necessitating helicopter travel <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> by national aid workers. The Department of Public Works and Highways worked quickly to clear the landslides and reopen closed roads. The country's National Food Authority provided about 73,000sacks of rice to storm victims, and the country planned to import 300,000tonnes of rice to overcome the lost crops. The Philippine Red Cross deployed search and rescue teams, as well as distributing food and coffee to 35,500people. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement launched a global request for assistance worth about $2.2million to help 240,000people.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Edward N. Hall was {{responsible}} for making the arrangements for the deployment. Two alternative plans were presented to Quarles, now the United States Deputy Secretary of Defense. One was for the United States to shoulder the cost, which would facilitate the fastest possible deployment. The other was for an agreement <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> on sharing costs with the British, which would take longer. Quarles shared the plans with Eisenhower and Macmillan in Bermuda, and directed Hall {{to proceed with the}} deployment as fast as the first plan, but with the costs of the second. The result was a slower, more costly deployment. A formal agreement was drawn up on 17 December 1957, although {{it was not until the}} end of the month that it was definitely determined that Britain would receive Thor and not Jupiter missiles. The deployment of Thor missiles was codenamed Project Emily.|$|E

5|$|During the 1991 Yugoslav {{campaign}} in Croatia, the 5th (Banja Luka) Corps of the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija, or JNA) was tasked with advancing north through western Slavonia from Okučani to Daruvar and Virovitica {{and with a}} secondary drive from Okučani towards Kutina. This was essentially consistent with the line expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> by {{the main thrust of}} the JNA, advancing from eastern Slavonia in about a week. The link was designed to facilitate a further advance west, to Zagreb and Varaždin. The corps had deployed a battlegroup of the 265th Mechanised Brigade near Okučani, supporting an advance which began on 21 September and reached the Papuk Mountains. The corps received one artillery and two motorised brigades as reinforcements during the advance, but the desertion and morale problems experienced by the JNA elsewhere also existed in the Banja Luka Corps.|$|E
5|$|German philosopher Jürgen Habermas has {{proposed}} a theory of discourse ethics that he claims is a descendant of Kantian ethics. He proposes that action {{should be based on}} communication between those involved, in which their interests and intentions are discussed so they can be understood by all. Rejecting any form of coercion or manipulation, Habermas believes that agreement between the parties is crucial for a moral decision <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reached.</b> Like Kantian ethics, discourse ethics is a cognitive ethical theory, in that it supposes that truth and falsity can be attributed to ethical propositions. It also formulates a rule by which ethical actions can be determined and proposes that ethical actions should be universalisable, in a similar way to Kant's ethics.|$|E

The vote in the state constitution was ratified 30 to 27, on July 26, 1788.|$|E

5|$|In acidic aqueous solution, thorium {{occurs as}} the tetrapositive aqua ion 4+, which has tricapped {{trigonal}} prismatic molecular geometry: at pH<3, the solutions of thorium salts {{are dominated by}} this cation. The Th4+ ion is {{the largest of the}} tetrapositive actinide ions, and depending on the coordination number can have a radius between 0.95and1.14Å. It is quite acidic due to its high charge, slightly stronger than sulfurous acid: thus it tends to undergo hydrolysis and polymerisation (though to a lesser extent than Fe3+), predominantly to 6+ in solutions with pH 3 or below, but in more alkaline solution polymerisation continues until the gelatinous hydroxide Th(OH)4 forms and precipitates out (though equilibrium may take weeks <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reached,</b> because the polymerisation usually slows down before the precipitation). As a hard Lewis acid, Th4+ favours hard ligands with oxygen atoms as donors: complexes with sulfur atoms as donors are less stable and are more prone to hydrolysis.|$|E
5|$|Rovelizumab, trade-named LeukArrest {{and also}} known as Hu23F2G, was {{developed}} to treat patients suffering from hemorrhagic shock, which is caused by massive blood loss. The drug is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the recruitment of white blood cells {{to the site of}} inflammation. During testing, few patients were given the drug, because LeukArrest had to be administered within four hours of the injury and informed consent was required; patients were often unconscious, and relatives had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> to give consent. In June1998, Icos and many medical centers asked the FDA to waive consent requirements in situations where the patient was at high risk of dying and relatives could not be reached. While some medical ethicists opposed waiving consent, the FDA approved the proposal in August1998 for five medical centers. Development of LeukArrest was halted in April2000 when interim data from phaseIII clinical trials did not meet Icos's goals of significantly reducing the chance of multiple organ failure and reducing the death rate from shock at 28days. LeukArrest was also tested unsuccessfully for treatment of heart attack, multiple sclerosis, and stroke.|$|E

The Corps received two motorised brigades and one artillery brigade as reinforcements during the advance, but the problems with morale and desertions experienced in eastern Slavonia were also present in the Banja Luka Corps. In one such instance, the 130th Mechanised Brigade, sent as a reinforcement, had been reduced to a 280-strong battalion by 29 September. The JNA was stopped by the ZNG between Novska, Nova Gradiška and Pakrac, even though some Croatian Serb militia units took positions on the Bilogora and Papuk north of Pakrac near Virovitica, and Slatina, with no JNA support.|$|E

It was during this period that he began to participate in the discussions of the Anglican–Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC); {{he was a member of}} the commission 1969–81 and again 1983–90. his early Evangelical sympathies having been tempered over time, helped by his friendship with Edward Yarnold, Master of Campion Hall. He was a master of the Anglican approach of producing statements capable of a range of interpretations to enable common ground <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reached,</b> this worked well for simpler historical differences, but did not always impress the Roman Catholic members of the commission when it came to questions of ecclesiology and church authority. He was also able to use his historical background to put forward summaries of early church positions on a variety of subjects, and he had a true desire to establish consensus on the basis of the principles revealed by this research. Although his scholarly output suffered from the pressures on his time, he was editor of Oxford Early Christian Texts (from 1970), and was able to work on two major monographs, Priscillian of Avila: the occult and the charismatic in the early Church (published 1976) and Boethius: the consolations of music, logic, theology and philosophy (published 1981).
