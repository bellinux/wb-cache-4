5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} is {{a technique}} used for determining the atomic and molecular structure of a crystal, in which the crystalline atoms cause a beam of incident X-rays <b>to</b> <b>diffract</b> into many specific directions. By measuring the angles and intensities of these diffracted beams, a crystallographer can produce a three-dimensional picture of the density of electrons within the crystal. From this electron density, the mean positions of the atoms in the crystal can be determined, {{as well as their}} chemical bonds, their disorder, and various other information.|$|E

50|$|Neutrons and X-rays {{interact}} with matter differently. X-rays interact primarily with the electron cloud surrounding each atom. The contribution <b>to</b> the <b>diffracted</b> x-ray intensity is therefore larger for atoms with larger atomic number (Z). On the other hand, neutrons interact {{directly with the}} nucleus of the atom, and the contribution <b>to</b> the <b>diffracted</b> intensity depends on each isotope; for example, regular hydrogen and deuterium contribute differently. It is also often the case that light (low Z) atoms contribute strongly <b>to</b> the <b>diffracted</b> intensity even in the presence of large Z atoms. The scattering length varies from isotope to isotope rather than linearly with the atomic number. An element like vanadium is a strong scatterer of X-rays, but its nuclei hardly scatter neutrons, which is why it is often used as a container material. Non-magnetic neutron diffraction is directly sensitive to the positions of the nuclei of the atoms.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe theory for {{the generation of}} a scattered acoustic boundary wave over a slightly rough planar surface has been developed by I. Tolstoy [J. Acoust. Soc. Am., _ 66 _ 1135 - 1144 (1979) ] and experimentally verified by Medwin et al., [J. Acoust. Soc. Am., 6 _ 6 1131 - 1134 (1979) ]. In the present experiment the propagation of the boundary wave over a wedge is studied. It is found that the boundary wave and the geometrically spreading volume wave diffract from the crest in the same manner. The amplitude ratio of the boundary wave <b>to</b> the <b>diffracted</b> volume wave, where {{the growth of the}} boundary wave from the crest is due to a phased line source at the crest caused by the diffracting volume wave, was found to have an average frequency dependence, f², and an average range dependence, R⁺⁰˙⁵. The amplitude ratio of boundary wave <b>to</b> <b>diffracted</b> volume wave due to propagation over the rough wedge gave an average frequency dependence of f² and an average range dependence of R⁰˙³.

40|$|We present {{measurements}} of iso-frequency dispersion surfaces of light scattered from metallic micro-gratings with different periods. The dispersion surfaces, obtained using an infinity-corrected microscope objective, exhibit maxima attributed <b>to</b> <b>diffracted</b> orders {{as they become}} evanescent and pronounced minima due to the resonant excitation of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). We have also measured the enhanced photoluminescence of {{a thin layer of}} dye molecules on top of the grating. This enhanced luminescence is attributed to the local field enhancement close to the surface due to the coupling of the excitation frequency to SPPs. Moreover, we obtain a directional emission of the luminescence, which is attributed to the grating-assisted coupling of SPPs excited by the dye to free space light.
