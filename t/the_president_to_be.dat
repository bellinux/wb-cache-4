5|$|McCain {{was born}} in the Panama Canal Zone. Had he been elected, he would have become the first {{president}} who was born outside the contiguous forty-eight states. This raised a potential legal issue, since the United States Constitution requires <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a natural-born citizen of the United States. A bipartisan legal review, and a unanimous but non-binding Senate resolution, both concluded that he is a natural-born citizen. Also, if inaugurated in 2009 at age 72years and 144days, he would have been the oldest U.S. president upon ascension to the presidency, and the second-oldest president to be inaugurated.|$|E
5|$|Before {{a person}} can be {{detained}} under the ISA by the Minister for Home Affairs, the President must be satisfied that such detention {{is necessary for the}} purposes of national security or public order. In the landmark case of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the Court of Appeal sought to impose legal limits on the power of preventive detention by requiring the Government to adduce objective facts which justified the President's satisfaction. Two months after the decision, a series of legislative and constitutional amendments was enacted that effectively reversed the Chng Suan Tze decision. These amendments were subsequently confirmed to be valid by the High Court and Court of Appeal in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1989–1990), which held it is sufficient for <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> subjectively satisfied that a detainee is a threat to national security in order for a detention order to be issued under the ISA. Notable ISA cases include Operation Coldstore in 1963 which led to the arrest of some 100 left-wing politicians and trade unionists, including members of the socialist opposition party, the Barisan Sosialis. Chia Thye Poh, an alleged Communist, was detained and subject to other restrictions on his liberty under the ISA from 1966 to 1998. The Chng Suan Tze and Teo Soh Lung cases resulted from a 1987 security operation called Operation Spectrum in which 22 Roman Catholic church and social activists and professionals accused of being members of a Marxist conspiracy were detained under the ISA.|$|E

25|$|In September 1962, de Gaulle {{sought a}} {{constitutional}} amendment to allow <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> directly elected by the people and issued another referendum to this end. After a motion of censure voted by the parliament on 4 October 1962, de Gaulle dissolved the National Assembly and held new elections. Although the left progressed, the Gaullists won an increased majority—this despite opposition from the Christian democratic Popular Republican Movement (MRP) and the National Centre of Independents and Peasants (CNIP) who criticised de Gaulle's euroscepticism and presidentialism.|$|E
25|$|Sirisena {{was sworn}} in as Sri Lanka's sixth {{executive}} president before Supreme Court judge K. Sripavan in Independence Square, Colombo at 6.20pm on 9 January 2015.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{selected}} by an electoral college composed {{of members of}} Parliament, members from every provincial assembly, and several delegates from the capital {{with the number of}} them being determined by how much representation they would <b>be</b> accorded <b>to</b> in Parliament based on population. The capital delegates and parliamentary delegates would meet in the capital to cast their vote, while the provincial assembly electors would do the same from their respective provincial capitals. All presidential candidates had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at least 40 years of age. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> chosen by the candidate with a simple majority.

25|$|There {{have been}} many {{suggestions}} for reforming the office of President over the years. In 1996, the Constitutional Review Group recommended that the office of President should remain largely unchanged. However, it suggested that the Constitution should be amended to explicitly declare <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> head of state (at present that term {{does not appear in}} the text), and that consideration be given to the introduction of a constructive vote of no confidence system in the Dáil, along the lines of that in Germany. If this system were introduced then the power of the President to refuse a Dáil dissolution would be largely redundant and could be taken away. The All-party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution's 1998 Report made similar recommendations.|$|E
25|$|By 1990 {{the revelation}} of Midnight Jackal lessened President Khan's {{influence}} in national politics, government and the military. Bhutto was thought by <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a young and inexperienced figure in politics, though highly educated. But he miscalculated her capabilities; she emerged as a 'power player' in international politics. Bhutto's authoritative actions frustrated the president; he was not taken in confidence when decisions were made. By 1990 a power struggle between {{the prime minister and}} president ensued. Because of the semi-presidential system, Bhutto needed permission from Khan to impose new policies. Khan vetoed many, as he felt they contradicted his point of view. Bhutto, through her legislators, also attempted to shift to a parliamentary democracy from the semi-presidential system, but Khan always used his constitutional powers to veto Bhutto's attempts.|$|E
25|$|However, it was {{not until}} the 1960s that the Syrian Brotherhood came to play a major role in politics, as part of a broad-based {{resistance}} movement, which developed into armed struggle, against the secular government. After the secular Ba'athist military coup of 8 March 1963, the new administration drastically restricted political freedoms, and concentrated power in the hands of the military and awarded prominent positions to the country's Alawite minority. Sunni Syrian Islamists – from the majority faith – did not have representation in the government. From the start, Islamic political groups, of which the Brotherhood was the most prominent, represented the strongest opposition to the government. The outlawing of Brotherhood in 1964 resulted in its radicalisation. In 1964 and 1965, strikes and mass demonstrations spread throughout Syria's major cities, especially in Hama, and were crushed by the military. In 1971, General Hafez al-Assad, an Alawite, seized power; in 1973 violent demonstrations broke out again in response to a proposed constitution that did not require <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a Muslim. Syria's intervention in the Lebanese civil war in 1976 on the side of the Maronites sparked renewed agitation in Syria, and assassinations began to target members of the Syrian government and prominent Alawites; the Muslim Brotherhood later claimed responsibility for most of these.|$|E
50|$|In 1994, {{amendments}} to the unity constitution eliminated <b>the</b> presidential council. <b>President</b> Ali Abdallah Saleh was elected by Parliament on 1 October 1994 to a 5-year term.

500|$|Norma Lois Peterson, in {{her book}} on Tyler's presidency, {{suggested}} that Tyler's general lack of success as president was due to external factors that would have affected whoever was in the White House. Chief among them was Henry Clay, who was determined to realize the vision he had for America, and who would brook no opposition. In the aftermath of Jackson's determined use of {{the powers of the}} Executive Branch, the Whigs wanted <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dominated by Congress, and Clay treated Tyler as a subordinate. [...] Tyler resented this, leading to the conflict between the branches that dominated his presidency. Pointing to Tyler's advances in foreign policy, she deemed Tyler's presidency [...] "flawed... but... not a failure".|$|E

The excavation of this tunnel, called [...] "Project ZP", was undertaken in 1987 to provide a route for <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> quickly and privately moved to the Presidential Emergency Operations Center {{in the event of an}} emergency.

500|$|The Court {{decided that}} both {{sections}} 8 and 10 of the ISA fell outside the precedent fact category. Section 8(1) expressly stated, [...] "in plain and unequivocal terms, {{that it is}} for <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> satisfied that detention is necessary {{with a view to}} preventing the detainee from acting in any manner prejudicial to national security and the decision had been entrusted to the President". Similarly, the decision whether there was evidence to revoke an order under section 10 in the public interest had expressly been entrusted to the Minister by the Act. In addition, since the Court was of the view that the judicial process was not suitable for determining issues involving national security, it did not think that Parliament could have intended for a court of law to determine whether, on the evidence, a detainee was likely to pose a security risk. Consequently, the Court could not go beyond determining if the detention decisions violated administrative law rules relating to illegality, irrationality or procedural impropriety.|$|E
