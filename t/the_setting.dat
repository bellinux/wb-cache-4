5|$|Many LARPs have game {{rules that}} {{determine}} how characters can affect {{each other and}} <b>the</b> <b>setting.</b> The rules may be defined in a publication or created by the gamemasters. These rules may define characters' capabilities, {{what can be done}} with various objects that exist in <b>the</b> <b>setting,</b> and what characters can do during the downtime between LARP events. Because referees are often not available to mediate all character actions, players are relied upon to be honest in their application of the rules.|$|E

5|$|Much of play {{consists}} of interactions between characters. Some LARP scenarios primarily feature interaction between PCs. Other scenarios focus on interaction between PCs and aspects of <b>the</b> <b>setting,</b> including NPCs, {{that are under}} the direction of the GMs.|$|E
5|$|Participants {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the crew may help the GMs {{to set up and}} maintain the environment of the LARP during play by acting as stagehands or playing non-player characters (NPCs) who fill out <b>the</b> <b>setting.</b> Crew typically receive more information about <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> and more direction from the GMs than players do. In a tabletop role-playing game, a GM usually plays all the NPCs, whereas in a LARP, each NPC is typically played by a separate crew member. Sometimes players are asked to play NPCs for periods of an event.|$|E
