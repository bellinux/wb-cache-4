5|$|Since then, {{the hospice}} {{industry}} has rapidly expanded. This growth has accompanied the AIDS epidemic and {{the aging of}} the population, with related illnesses. By 1995, hospices were a $2.8 billion industry, with $1.9 billion from Medicare alone funding patients in 1,857 hospice programs with Medicare certification. In that year, 72% of hospice providers were non-profit. By 1998, there were 3,200 hospices either in operation or under development throughout the United States and Puerto Rico, according to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO). According to 2007's Last Rights: Rescuing the End of Life from <b>the</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>System,</b> hospice sites are expanding at a national rate of about 3.5% per year. In 2007, 1.4 million people in the United States used hospice, with more than one-third of dying Americans using the service, approximately 39%. In 2008, Medicare alone, which pays for 80% of hospice treatment, paid $10 billion to the 4,000 Medicare-certified providers in the United States.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the analysis of patterns of transcultural health care utilisation behaviour of {{the inhabitants of the}} communities Pirgos and Praitoria in Crete, Greece. In this way, this study pays specific attention to the people's indigenous knowledge of Medicinal, Aromatic and Cosmetic (MAC) plants in relation to their utilisation of <b>the</b> plural <b>medical</b> <b>system</b> available in <b>the</b> research area, particularly <b>the</b> traditional <b>medical</b> <b>system.</b> Apart from <b>the</b> traditional <b>medical</b> <b>system</b> available in this part of Crete, which comprises not only MAC plants but also other traditional home remedies as well as religious and spiritual forms of medicine, the community members seek <b>medical</b> treatment from <b>the</b> transitional <b>medical</b> <b>system</b> in <b>the</b> form of pharmaceutical medicines and from <b>the</b> modern <b>medical</b> <b>system</b> in <b>the</b> form of consultation with a modern health care provider.

25|$|Between 2001 and 2003, Cristi Puiu {{suffered}} from stress and an exaggerated fear of relatively minor ailments; {{as a result}} of his hypochondria, he frequently sought medical help. Although he learned that he was suffering from stress and a common form of colitis, Puiu became convinced that he had a terminal disease. The resulting fear of dying made him obsessively collect information on diseases and medication, and he spent much time in doctors' offices and emergency rooms. This period informed his portrayal of <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>system</b> in this film.|$|E
25|$|The {{campaign}} {{addresses the}} problem of patients receiving unnecessary health care, reasoning that this results in poor outcomes for the patient and could create significant waste in the United States healthcare system. To conduct the campaign, a coordinator from ABIM Foundation asks medical specialty professional organizations to make five recommendations for preventing overuse of a treatment in their field. Distributors then share this information with community groups nationwide, and the medical specialty societies disseminate it to their members. The intent is that patients and doctors will discuss the recommendations in these lists, believing that if patients and doctors {{communicate with each other}} more effectively when making health decisions patients will have better outcomes and <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>system</b> itself will benefit.|$|E

He, however, helped to raise the status of surgery in Christian Europe; in his book on fractures and luxations, he states that ‘this part of surgery has passed {{into the hands of}} vulgar and uncultivated minds, for which reason it has fallen into contempt.’ The surgery of Albucasis became firmly grafted on Europe after the time of Guy de Chauliac (d.1368).|$|E

2500|$|Usually, triage {{refers to}} prioritising admission. [...] A similar {{process can be}} applied to {{discharging}} patients early when <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>system</b> is stressed. [...] This process has been called [...] "reverse triage". [...] During a [...] "surge" [...] in demand, such as immediately after a natural disaster, many hospital beds will be occupied by regular non-critical patients. [...] In order to accommodate a greater number of the new critical patients, the existing patients may be triaged, and those who will not need immediate care can be discharged until the surge has dissipated, for example through the establishment of temporary medical facilities in the region.|$|E

2500|$|For example, {{some believe}} that livers should not be given to alcoholics in danger of reversion, while others view {{alcoholism}} as a medical condition like diabetes. Faith in <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>system</b> {{is important to the}} success of organ donation. Brazil switched to an opt-out system and ultimately had to withdraw it because it further alienated patients who already distrusted the country's medical system. Adequate funding, strong political will to see transplant outcomes improve, and the existence of specialized training, care and facilities also increase donation rates. Expansive legal definitions of death, such as Spain uses, also increase the pool of eligible donors by allowing physicians to declare a patient to be dead at an earlier stage, when the organs are still in good physical condition.Allowing or forbidding payment for organs affects the availability of organs. Generally, where organs cannot be bought or sold, quality and safety are high, but supply is not adequate to the demand. Where organs can be purchased, the supply increases.|$|E
2500|$|Dark Before Dawn was {{the first}} album to not feature former members Aaron Fink (guitar) and Mark Klepaski (bass).

The two musicians were subsequently fired from the band and sued for punitive and compensatory damages. Fink and Klepaski's attorneys asserted that at issue was a 2009 agreement allowing Burnley to dismiss them for [...] "cause", asserting it was no longer valid due to Burnley's status of indefinite hiatus while he was too ill to perform. After being ordered by a judge to arbitration, the issues were settled, announced in April 2013, as Burnley reserved the exclusive right to continue under the band name Breaking Benjamin. Shortly thereafter, drummer Chad Szeliga announced his departure from the band, citing creative differences.|$|E
2500|$|The Citadel (1937), {{a tale of}} {{a mining}} company doctor's {{struggle}} to balance scientific integrity with social obligations, helped to incite {{the establishment of the}} National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom by exposing the inequity and incompetence of medical practice at the time. In the novel Cronin advocated a free public health service in order to defeat the wiles of those doctors who [...] "raised guinea-snatching and the bamboozling of patients to an art form." [...] Dr Cronin and Aneurin Bevan had both worked at the Tredegar Cottage Hospital in Wales, which served as one of the bases for the NHS. The author quickly made enemies in the medical profession, and there was a concerted effort by one group of specialists to get The Citadel banned. Cronin's novel, which was the highest-selling book ever published by Victor Gollancz, informed the public about corruption within <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>system,</b> planting a seed that eventually led to reform. Not only were the author's pioneering ideas instrumental {{in the creation of the}} NHS, but the historian Raphael Samuel asserted in 1995 that the popularity of Cronin's novels played a substantial role in the Labour Party's landslide victory in 1945.|$|E

In the winter frostbite often sent soldiers to <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>system</b> while {{in the spring and}} fall rains made trench foot a common aliment. The frontovik were paid once every month, but often did not receive their wages. All soldiers were exempt from taxes. In 1943, a private was paid 600 roubles per month, a corporal 1,000 roubles, a junior sergeant 2,000 roubles and a sergeant 3,000 roubles. There was special pay for those serving in guards units, paratroopers, tank, anti-tank and those decorated for bravery in combat. Those units that greatly distinguished in combat had the prefix Guards attached to their unit title, a title of great respect and honor that brought better pay and rations. In the Imperial Russian Army, the elite was always the Imperial Guards Regiments, and the title Guards when applied to a military unit in Russia still has elitist connotations.|$|E
