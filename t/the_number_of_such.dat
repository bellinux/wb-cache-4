In {{the second half of}} the 20th century and in the 21st century <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> games increased enormously, providing a wide variety of entertainment to players around the world.

5|$|Examples {{of liquid}} {{crystals}} {{can also be}} found in the mineral world, most of them being lyotropics. The first discovered was Vanadium(V) oxide, by Zocher in 1925. Since then, few others have been discovered and studied in detail. The existence of a true nematic phase {{in the case of the}} smectite clays family was raised by Langmuir in 1938, but remained open for a very long time and was only solved recently. With the rapid development of nanosciences, and the synthesis of many new anisotropic nanoparticles, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> mineral liquid crystals is quickly increasing, with, for example, carbon nanotubes and graphene.|$|E
5|$|Numerous climatological factors {{influence}} {{the formation of}} hurricanes in the Pacific basins. The North Pacific High and Aleutian Low, usually present between January and April, cause strong wind shear and unfavorable conditions {{for the development of}} hurricanes. During its presence, El Niño results in increased numbers of powerful hurricanes through weaker wind shear, while La Niña reduces <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> hurricanes through the opposite. Global warming may also {{influence the}} formation of tropical cyclones in the Pacific basin. During a thirty-year period with two sub-periods, the first between 1975 and 1989 and the second between 1990 and 2004, an increase of thirteenCategory4 or 5 storms was observed from the first sub-period.|$|E

40|$|Most of the {{constructions of}} {{pseudorandom}} graphs {{are based on}} additive or multiplicative groups of elements of finite fields. As a result <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> vertices <b>of</b> <b>such</b> graphs is limited to values of prime powers or some simple polynomial expressions involving prime powers.

5|$|On Independence Day and Republic Day, {{patriotic}} {{songs in}} regional languages are broadcast {{on television and}} radio channels. They are also played alongside flag hoisting ceremonies. Patriotic films are broadcast. Over the decades, according to The Times of India, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> films broadcast has decreased as channels report that audiences are oversaturated with patriotic films. The population cohort that belong to the Generation Next often combine nationalism with popular culture during the celebrations. This mixture is exemplified by outfits and savouries dyed with the tricolour and designer garments that represent India's various cultural traditions. Retail stores offer Independence Day sales promotions. Some news reports have decried the commercialism. Indian Postal Service publishes commemorative stamps depicting independence movement leaders, nationalistic themes and defence-related themes on 15 August.|$|E
5|$|Stone keep {{construction}} required skilled craftsmen. Unlike {{timber and}} earthworks, {{which could be}} built using unfree labour or serfs, these craftsmen had to be paid and stone keeps were therefore expensive. They were also relatively slow to erect, due to {{the limitations of the}} lime mortar used during the period – a keep's walls could usually be raised by a maximum of only 12 feet (3.6 metres) a year; the keep at Scarborough was not atypical in taking ten years to build. <b>The</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> keeps remained relatively low: in England, for example, although several early stone keeps had been built after the conquest, there were only somewhere between ten and fifteen in existence by 1100, and only around a hundred had been built by 1216.|$|E
5|$|The {{district}} is generally rural, with no towns approaching {{the size of}} Hull. There are a few market towns such as Beverley, Driffield, Goole, Market Weighton and Pocklington, and the coastal towns of Bridlington, Hornsea and Withernsea. In the south the district contains areas such as Hessle which {{are part of the}} Hull urban area but outside the city boundaries. Rural areas tend to have a greater business stock than urban areas, reflecting the number of agricultural businesses and small businesses in rural areas. 20% of all VAT registered businesses in the East Riding are in agriculture and related sectors, although <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> businesses fell by 40% between 1997 and 2003.|$|E

In addition to Liberal Arts courses, students can take advanced placement biology, chemistry, physics, anatomy & physiology, forensic science, robotics, geometry, algebra 2, and calculus at the AEA. Students preparing for civil engineering and architecture careers can take pre-engineering, computer networking and computer aided design (CAD) at the AEA. The AEA offers a course in Mandarin Chinese added in 2016, {{making it one of}} the few high schools in New Jersey to do so. The Advanced Placement participation rate in the school was 13%.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War in 1861 between {{the northern and southern}} states also contributed to the trend. The war disrupted the sale of northern ice to the south, and Maine merchants instead turned to supplying the Union Army, whose forces used ice in their more southern campaigns. James L. Cheeseman had responded to the 1860 ice famine by moving his ice trading business from the Hudson northwards into Maine, bringing with him the latest technology and techniques; Cheeseman went on to win valuable contracts with the Union Army during the war years. Carré ice machines were brought into New Orleans to make up the shortfall in the south, focusing in particular on supplying southern hospitals. In the post-war years, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> plants increased, but once competition from the north recommenced, cheaper natural ice initially made it hard for the manufacturers to make a profit. By the late 1870s, however, efficiency improvements were allowing them to squeeze natural ice out of the marketplace in the south.|$|E

40|$|A {{significant}} increase in titre of human heterophil antibodies against rat erythrocytes was demonstrated in eighteen of twenty-eight patients after renal transplantation. Although this rise in titre preceded an acute rejection episode in the renal graft in some instances, it is considered that this relationship was coincidental.

50|$|However, {{immunosuppression}} {{has many}} other potential causes. Individuals who take glucocorticoids or immunosuppressive drugs to prevent transplant rejection or to treat autoimmune diseases can have increased susceptibility to unusual infections, as do individuals with certain genetic conditions, severe malnutrition and {{certain kinds of}} cancers. There is no evidence suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> cases have risen, while abundant epidemiologic evidence shows a very large rise in cases of immunosuppression among individuals who share one characteristic: HIV infection.|$|R
