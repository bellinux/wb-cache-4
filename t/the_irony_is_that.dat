25|$|<b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Nately {{actually}} {{sees his}} friends as Yossarian, Orr, Hungry Joe and Dunbar whom his parents {{would not be}} impressed with, but equally his parents would not like Aarfy whom they would see as a “climber”.|$|E
25|$|Both tickets offer All-Star Game goers {{unmatched}} {{vantage points}} in Busch Stadium at prices that are significantly discounted {{from the market}} value of a professional game. The opportunity to get an autograph from a Hall of Famer is a complimentary bonus. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Lou Brock was asked to participate in the event long before the connection was made between the Lewis & Clark Baseball League and the St. Louis great's full name: Louis Clark Brock.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Hillenburg {{enrolled}} in the Experimental Animation Program at CalArts: [...] "Changing careers like that is scary, but <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> animation is a pretty healthy career right now and science education {{is more of a}} struggle," [...] he admitted. He studied under Jules Engel, the founding director of the program, whom he considers his [...] "Art Dad" [...] and mentor. Engel accepted him into the program impressed by The Intertidal Zone. Hillenburg posited further, [...] " [...] also was a painter, so I think he saw my paintings and could easily say, 'Oh, this guy could fit in to this program.' I don't have any [...] animation really." [...] He graduated in 1992, earning a Master of Fine Arts in experimental animation.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> by <b>the</b> {{time the}} story was published, the Bikini Club had been gone for over a year.|$|R
5000|$|Townshend {{stated in}} an {{interview}} <b>that</b> Baba O'Riley' <b>is</b> about the absolute desolation of teenagers at Woodstock, where audience members were strung out on acid and 20 people had brain damage. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> some listeners took the song to be a teenage celebration: 'Teenage Wasteland, yes! We're all wasted! ...|$|R
50|$|In 2002, {{however, the}} Anti-Sec {{community}} published {{use of the}} term to refer to people who work in the security industry by day, but engage in black hat activities by night. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> for black hats, this interpretation was seen as a derogatory term; whereas amongst white hats it <b>was</b> a term <b>that</b> lent a sense of popular notoriety.|$|R
2500|$|The {{story is}} told by [...] "Thérèse" [...] in an inn, to Madame de Lorsagne. It is finally {{revealed}} that Madame de Lorsagne is her long-lost sister. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> her sister submitted to {{a brief period of}} vice and found herself a comfortable existence where she could exercise good, while Justine refused to make concessions for the greater good and was plunged further into vice than those who would go willingly.|$|E
2500|$|Within London, {{the desire}} for banks to be there put {{pressure}} on the City of London's ability to accommodate them. [...] In the mid-1980s a crisis point was reached and, although the City was able to expand its stock of modern office space, this did not happen before Canary Wharf had been set up as a competitor. [...] <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Canary Wharf was built in the London Docklands that had, until 1970, been among the largest docks in the world. All manner of goods had been shipped from the factories of east London to the world; between 1961 and 1993 manufacturing employment in London fell from 1.6million to 328,000.|$|E
2500|$|The ill-feeling {{seems to}} have spread into the next {{generation}} for James records that John has cut 'march' trees down {{in the past and}} has thrown thorns and brambles from the march into the High Chapeltoun's hayfields. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> John of Laigh Chapelton is suing James for cutting down trees from the march dyke and requires money to plant new trees and to compensate for the inconvenience he has been put through. We do not know the outcome, however the action is described as [...] "trifling and frivolous". The clue to the ill-feeling may be in the term 'straightening' which may imply that John's father agreed to a new march which may have resulted in some small loss of his lands.|$|E
25|$|The governor's {{race that}} year between Treen and Edwin Washington Edwards, making his third-term comeback, had been {{decided in the}} jungle primary in favor of Edwards by a wide margin. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Fitzmorris had won twice as {{lieutenant}} governor with Edwards {{at the top of}} the ballot. This time Edwards supported Freeman. It was a political oddity <b>that</b> <b>was</b> devastating to Fitzmorris. He never politically recovered from the defeat.|$|R
25|$|Prior to {{the hearing}} {{there had been}} a spate of {{criticism}} of the South African Judiciary by Zuma supporters, amongst whom were some prominent legal minds, such as Paul Ngobeni. In <b>that</b> context, <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> third time the South African Judiciary had found in his favour, including Zuma's acquittal of the rape charge brought against him. The NDPP soon announced its intention to appeal the decision.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> McNaughton's {{scheme for}} staving off {{revolution}} had {{the seeds of}} revolution inherent in it. Within two years the camps <b>that</b> had <b>been</b> greeted with such applause would be known throughout the country as slave camps. The [...] "volunteer inmates" [...] were not allowed newspapers, magazines or radios. Any man who left a camp, even for a visit to his family, was subsequently refused re-entry and the [...] "dole" [...] was denied to him.|$|R
2500|$|One year later, Out of Here {{was shown}} at Galerie Lelong in New York City. This second {{iteration}} contained {{an excerpt from}} a different speech by the President, and mentioned {{the end of the}} war and the gradual withdrawal of troops. Speaking on the changes, the artist commented, “It made the work more up to date…but <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this project didn’t have to change much.” [...] Wodiczko cited the locations, Boston and New York, as sufficient to garner different readings of the work. “The works in Boston and New York have different publics. New York’s character and the [...] shows gave Out of Here a big international audience as opposed to the more local audience in Boston.” Collectively, these narratives paint a picture of the individual veterans who told them, the larger picture of the Iraq War, and the more subtle clues to the war’s repercussions.|$|E
5000|$|According to Dreyfus, <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Shuk-den is {{presented}} by his followers as the {{protector of the}} Ge-luk (dge lugs) school, of which the Dalai Lama is the (de facto) leader.|$|E
50|$|Mohun Biswas, in {{the novel}} A House for Mr Biswas (1961), by V.S. Naipaul, is pleased to think himself a {{follower}} of Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius; <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he never actually behaves as a Stoic.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> great <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> victorious {{general of}} Isandlwana was himself {{killed by a}} fellow veteran of the battle. Today Ntshingwayo is {{traditionally}} regarded as a Zulu hero.|$|R
50|$|This {{inductive}} {{system was}} prone to frequent damage to the underground feeder cables, overhead cables, and the loops themselves. Later the MW transmitter {{was replaced by a}} freely radiating, low-power FM transmitter. But the last time I tuned in, an audio signal ground had dropped off somewhere, so you could only hear the difference between the left and right channel (i.e. the stereo bit, on <b>the</b> music). <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> presenter <b>was</b> in mono, and was therefore completely inaudible on the broadcast.|$|R
30|$|The day {{cancellation}} rate of 5.44 % in {{this study}} is similar to the national mean reported 7  years ago by the Audit Commission [1] but <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> two of <b>the</b> four cancellations were due to theatre overrunning. Cancelled cases have financial implications as national contracts require trusts to rebook cancelled patients within 28  days, thus creating extra pressure on existing scheduled lists. It is equally important to recognize socioeconomic impact on patients who have undoubtedly arranged their work and family commitment around operation dates [11].|$|R
50|$|Mhow was a meter gauge railway {{district}} headquarters {{during the}} British Raj {{and even after}} 1947. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Mhow finally has a broad gauge connection with Indore but regular train services are yet to commence.|$|E
50|$|According to the poem, {{the rulers}} of Europe {{believed}} that sacrificing their nations' (Ram of) Pride was too high a price, yet <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the real cost of this Pride was millions of dead—the seed of Europe.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Nately {{actually}} {{sees his}} friends as Yossarian, Orr, Hungry Joe and Dunbar whom his parents {{would not be}} impressed with, but equally his parents would not like Aarfy whom they would see as a “climber”.|$|E
50|$|The {{story was}} {{told of the}} General sucking snake venom from James Spratt, son of Kanawha Spartt, that saved James' life. The General gave the Spratts the land on the {{reservation}}. (This is just one version of who gave the land on the reservation to the Spratts.) General New River even borrowed Thomas Spartt's horse at one time. The General rode the horse hard and Spratt beat him for this infraction. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> later Spratt killed the same horse, doing exactly what he had beaten General New River for doing.|$|R
5000|$|In the UK, a brief {{excursion}} from standards, GPO telecoms {{introduced in}} 1967 their first push-button telephone, the GPO 726 (Ericsson N2000 series [...] ), that used neither pulse dialing nor DTMF tones. It used a DC signalling system comprising {{a number of}} rectifier diodes arranged in different polarity configuration according to the button pressed. The 726 also required an ground wire {{as well as the}} usual A and B wires. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dial signal still had to be converted to pulses in the host PABX.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> other Russian commanders did {{not realize}} the {{potential}} of the tactics that Brusilov had devised. Similar tactics had also been used on the Western Front, most notably at Verdun earlier in the year, and would henceforth be used to an even greater degree by the French and Germans - who utilized [...] "storm troopers" [...] to great effect in the 1918 offensive - and slightly later the British, although given the higher force-space ratio in the West, much greater concentration of artillery fire was needed to make progress.|$|R
50|$|The lust song. Amos, {{thinking}} {{that he is in}} love, recounts the excitement he feels for his new relationship. And for Amos, every night with Shelby truly is Heaven sent. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this relationship is the best AND worst thing that has ever happened to Amos.|$|E
5000|$|... “What {{is already}} known {{is that there}} will be no winners or losers. Legal fees have been eye watering, {{diverting}} valuable resources that could otherwise have been used to fund research and teaching. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the legal fees dwarf the budget savings that the Warburg were originally asked to find.” ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I've {{really come}} full circle. The more science I studied, the more I saw that physics becomes metaphysics and numbers become {{imaginary}} numbers. The farther {{you go into}} science, the mushier the ground gets. You start to say, 'Oh, there is an order and a spiritual aspect to science.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Ironically, {{the regular}} news reports during Lassiter's show {{featured}} {{the story of}} a car that had backed full speed into a large propane tank at a gas station in nearby Brandon, Florida, killing the heretofore unknown driver in a fiery crash. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> driver <b>was</b> Dick Norman. When he was informed of Norman's death several minutes into the show, Lassiter immediately issued a very emotional, repentant, on-air apology and filled in for the rest of Norman's timeslot, inviting listeners to call in and share their reminiscences of [...] "Uncle Dickie." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} story, <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> men <b>were</b> {{in orbit around}} Vesta with no source of motive power and limited food and air but a year's supply of water. They {{find a way to}} use the water as a {{makeshift}} rocket in order to reach Vesta, and on the way down they make a toast: [...] "Here's to the year's supply of water we used to have." [...] At the end of this story, they change the toast to [...] "Here's to the Silver Queen souvenirs we used to have." ...|$|R
50|$|The verdict dealt {{a blow to}} {{the notion}} of {{parliamentary}} supremacy in Pakistan. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Pakistan <b>was</b> an independent dominion created by the Indian Independence Act 1947. The British parliament enjoyed parliamentary supremacy in its own realm. But the Federal Court's verdict stripped Pakistan's parliamentary supremacy, even though Pakistan itself was an independent realm of the British monarchy. The verdict paved way for the future judiciary to support unconstitutional and undemocratic actions, such as military coups. The doctrine of necessity was applied by successive Pakistani and Bangladeshi courts to validate the actions of marital law authorities.|$|R
50|$|There is {{irony in}} the story. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they brought the ghost with them. The ghost appears to the house’s {{inhabitants}} {{but they do not}} realize it until long after the damage is done. The Boyne’s bought the house because of the ghost and the ghost took Ned away, in effect wrecking their idyllic life.|$|E
5000|$|The {{motto of}} the academy [...] "Camaraderie" [...] (...) was proclaimed by Sun Yat-sen at the opening ceremonies. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> during the Chinese Civil War both the commanders from KMT and CCP were trained and educated in Whampoa. They fought for {{different}} beliefs and ideals although they used to live and study together like brothers in arms.|$|E
5000|$|Early on, Deogratias {{stops the}} Frenchman from {{swatting}} a cockroach; regarding the [...] "cockroach" [...] slur used by Hutu extremists to describe Tutsis, {{this shows that}} he regrets his actions during the conflict and wants to preserve what's left. Adding to <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Benina and Apollinaria, both Tutsis, were like sisters to him, yet he aided in their deaths.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> on December 7, 1969, exactly 36 years before, Venforet Kofu's forerunner the Kofu Club, {{played and}} lost in Promotion/Relegation Series (JSL, {{at the time a}} single division, against the two finalists of the Shakaijin Cup; Kofu had been runner-up) against the Hitachi Club (Kashiwa Reysol's {{previous}} affiliation), who had finished 7th of 8 in the old league. Before the 2005 series, and excepting the 1973 season when as JSL Division 2 runners-up they lost another series at the hands of now-defunct Nippon Kokan, this had been the closest Kofu came to competing in the top division.|$|R
5000|$|In the UK, a brief {{excursion}} from standards, GPO telecoms {{introduced in}} 1968 their first push-button telephone, the GPO 726 (Ericsson N2000 series [...] ), that used neither pulse dialing nor DTMF tones. It used a DC signalling system comprising {{a number of}} rectifier diodes arranged in different polarity configuration according to the button pressed. The 726 also requires a ground wire {{as well as the}} usual A and B wires. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> with <b>the</b> few installations, the dial signal still had to be converted to pulses in the host PABX. It is now a rare device.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{ultimate}} <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> judge {{finds the}} security forces didn't act punitively, that Lily and Michael were armed according to non-existent witnesses and <b>that</b> Skinner <b>was</b> the innocent instead of the angry young man who despite his background wanted a free Ireland.|$|R
