5|$|Candidates for Freemasonry {{will have}} met most active members of <b>the</b> <b>Lodge</b> they are joining {{before they are}} initiated. The process varies between jurisdictions, but the {{candidate}} will typically have been introduced by a friend at a Lodge social function, or at some form of open evening in <b>the</b> <b>Lodge.</b> In modern times, interested people often track down a local Lodge through the Internet. The onus is on candidates to ask to join; while candidates may be encouraged to ask, they are never invited. Once the initial inquiry is made, an interview usually follows to determine the candidate's suitability. If the candidate decides to proceed from here, <b>the</b> <b>Lodge</b> ballots on the application before he (or she, depending on the Masonic Jurisdiction) can be accepted.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the next}} few years <b>the</b> Grand <b>Lodge</b> went about petitioning <b>the</b> <b>lodges</b> of Canada West to come under the fold of their newly created Grand Lodge. Within a few years, not only were almost all <b>the</b> masonic <b>lodges</b> of Canada West under the {{jurisdiction}} of the GLC, but, since 1859, so were most of <b>the</b> <b>lodges</b> of Canada East. However, in 1869, sixteen of <b>the</b> <b>lodges</b> in Quebec (formerly Canada East) formed their own Grand Lodge, and in 1874 <b>the</b> Grand <b>Lodge</b> of Canada completely withdrew from the province of Québec, and twenty-four more <b>lodges</b> moved from <b>the</b> Grand <b>Lodge</b> of Canada to <b>the</b> Grand <b>Lodge</b> of Quebec. In 1887 the name of <b>the</b> Grand <b>Lodge</b> was changed to <b>the</b> Grand <b>Lodge</b> of Canada in the Province of Ontario, a compromise name which reflects both the Ontario-only jurisdiction of <b>the</b> Grand <b>Lodge</b> as well as its history of being <b>the</b> first Grand <b>Lodge</b> in Canada.|$|R

5|$|In {{the sixteenth}} and seventeenth centuries, {{the status of}} women amongst masons in Britain is likely to be similar to that codified in the minutes of <b>the</b> <b>lodge</b> at St. Mary's Chapel in Edinburgh. A burgess could pay for the Freedom to employ and {{instruct}} masons. The widow of a master mason could accept commissions from his old clients, provided that she employed a journeyman of <b>the</b> <b>lodge</b> to supervise the work.|$|E

The non-freeway Northwestern Highway, until then designated M-4, was also renumbered as M-10. The southernmost portion of <b>the</b> <b>Lodge</b> Freeway was also initially redesignated as a portion of BS I-375 from I-75 south. By the next year however, {{the southern end of}} M-10 was moved to the corner of Jefferson and Randolph, placing all of <b>the</b> <b>Lodge</b> Freeway as part of M-10.|$|E

It is plain from Gould's obituary that the rest of <b>the</b> <b>lodge</b> looked on him as a mentor.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} sets of {{greenhouses}} near the property; one set behind Law's home produced decorations for Law's Briarcliff Farms, his house, <b>the</b> <b>lodge,</b> and workers' houses. The other set, the Pierson Greenhouses, were used for growing the American Beauty rose and rare carnations, producing between 5,000 and 8,000 per week.

5|$|After {{moving to}} London, his editorship of the Freemason ignited an {{interest}} in the study of Masonic history, and led to the establishment of Quatuor Coronati Lodge, dedicated to masonic research.

Just before his death, towards the end of 1887, he passed on a set of coded papers which resulted in the establishment of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>lodge</b> was completed, it {{was decided}} to build a {{restaurant}} and breezeway onto <b>the</b> <b>lodge</b> building.

The CCC project also completed sixteen one-room log cabins and three four-bedroom cabins. The work crews also built picnic shelters, trail shelters, and foot bridges. Only the logs for the cabins came from another source. They were purchased from a salvage company that had purchased utility poles from a defunct utility company at the price of 30 cents a piece.|$|E
