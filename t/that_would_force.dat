5|$|The Quincy Convention of October 1845 passed resolutions {{demanding}} that the Latter-day Saints withdraw from Nauvoo by May 1846. A few days later, the Carthage Convention called for establishment of a militia <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>force</b> them out if they {{failed to meet the}} May deadline. To try to meet this deadline and to get an early start on the trek to the Great Basin, the Latter-day Saints began leaving Nauvoo in February 1846.|$|E
5|$|During the Kerch-Feodosiya Operation, Krasnyi Krym sailed {{into the}} harbor of Feodosiya on 29 December 1941 and disembarked {{reinforcements}} and provided gunfire support for Soviet troops already ashore. She was hit eleven times by Axis artillery and mortar fire in retaliation. Between 15 and 21 January 1942 she landed {{the bulk of the}} 266th Mountain Regiment at Sudak and reinforced them with 1576 troops of the 544th Rifle Regiment between 23 and 26 January. During the following months Krasnyi Krym brought in reinforcements for the garrison of Sevastopol and evacuated the wounded, sometimes bombarding German positions en route, her last such mission being on 3 June 1942, after the Germans had already launched the attack <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>force</b> the city to surrender in July. She was awarded the Guards title on 18 June in recognition of her performance.|$|E
5|$|The club {{went public}} in 1990 and {{was the subject of}} {{takeover}} bids from property trader Michael Knighton and Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB corporation before Malcolm Glazer's stake was announced in September 2003. By the end of the year, Glazer had increased his shareholding from 3.17% to around 15%, which he almost doubled in the year up to October 2004. His acquisition of John Magnier and J. P. McManus's 28.7% stake in May 2005 pushed his own up to around 57%, well over the 30% threshold <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>force</b> him to launch a takeover bid. A few days later, he took control of 75% of the club's shares, allowing him to delist the company from the stock exchange, and within a month, the Glazers took 98% ownership of the club via their Red Football parent company, forcing a squeeze out of the remaining 2%. The final purchase price of the club totalled almost £800million.|$|E

5|$|Jack is {{contacted}} by Atlas via radio, and is guided to safety from the Splicers and {{the perils of}} the run down city. Atlas requests Jack's help in stopping Ryan, directing him to a docked bathysphere where he claims Ryan has trapped his family. When Jack encounters a wandering Little Sister and its fallen Big Daddy, Atlas urges Jack to kill the Little Sister to harvest her ADAM for himself; Dr. Tenenbaum overhears this and intercepts Jack before he harms the Little Sister, urging him to spare the child and any other Little Sisters he encounters, providing him with a plasmid <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>force</b> the sea slug out of her body. Jack eventually works {{his way to the}} bathysphere, but Ryan destroys it before Jack can reach it. Enraged, Atlas directs Jack towards Ryan's mansion through Ryan's army of Splicers and Big Daddies. At times, Jack is forced to travel through areas controlled by Ryan's allies that have now become deranged, such as Sander Cohen, a former musician that now takes enjoyment in watching the death and misery of others.|$|E

25|$|November 21, 2006 – Lebanon's Industry Minister Pierre Amine Gemayel {{was assassinated}} in his car by gunmen in Jdeideh, a Christian {{neighborhood}} {{on the outskirts of}} Beirut, bringing the Cabinet one seat closer to the nine empty seats <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>force</b> it to collapse. He was a young, outspoken opponent of Syria's occupation of Lebanon and its influence in the country. Analysts said Gemayel's death was likely to worsen tensions in the already divided country. Hours after the assassination, the Security Council approved the draft accord for the creation of the Hariri tribunal, sending it to the Lebanese government for final approval.|$|E
25|$|Though the Confederacy {{hoped that}} Britain and France would join {{them against the}} Union, this was never likely, and so they instead tried to bring Britain and France in as mediators. The Union, under Lincoln and Secretary of State William H. Seward worked to block this, and {{threatened}} war if any country officially recognized {{the existence of the}} Confederate States of America. In 1861, Southerners voluntarily embargoed cotton shipments, hoping to start an economic depression in Europe <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>force</b> Britain to enter the war to get cotton, but this did not work. Worse, Europe developed other cotton suppliers, which they found superior, hindering the South's recovery after the war.|$|E

25|$|Pitt {{wanted a}} bold stroke <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>force</b> the French to detach {{large numbers of}} troops, planned {{to be used in}} their {{invasion}} of Germany, to protect the French coast against further raids. He also hoped to satisfy the public who clamoured for such a campaign. An urgent demand for such an expedition came from Britain's only major ally Frederick the Great who saw it as vital to relieve pressure from an anticipated French offensive against Prussia. Frederick had suggested attacks on the French coast in the hope that it would provide immediate relief to both his own armies and the Army of Observation under the Duke of Cumberland.|$|E
25|$|Miller has {{collected}} two Turkish traditions about {{the fall of}} Trebizond. One tells how {{the citizens of the}} city, expecting an army to arrive before dawn <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>force</b> the Sultan to lift the siege, agreed to surrender at cock-crow. However, on that occasion the roosters crowed in the small hours of the night, whereupon the Turks forced the city-dwellers to keep their word. The other describes how a girl, dressed in black, held out in the tower of the palace, and when all was lost, leaped to her death from its heights; consequently that tower was called Kara kızın saray ("The Black Girl's palace").|$|E
25|$|California's {{state budget}} woes are {{expected}} to put more pressure on cities such as Burbank. State lawmakers have proposed eliminating the individual redevelopment agencies, a move <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>force</b> cities such as Burbank to eliminate much needed infrastructure projects. Local redevelopment agencies also {{may be forced to}} reimburse the state. For example, Burbank Redevelopment Agency might have pay the state nearly $20 million. But the city is fighting the return of at least $15 million in redevelopment funds, including money that was slated for the Lundigan Community Center and improvements to Johnny Carson Park. Whether Burbank will ultimately prevail is unclear, as the state's budget hole is getting worse due to the slow economy and lower than expected state revenues.|$|E

25|$|During {{the night}} two events {{occurred}} <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>force</b> Pope {{to change his}} mind. A staff officer arrived from the Germantown position to report that a heavy force of cavalry had shelled the intersection before retreating. Fortunately for Lee and Stuart, Pope dismissed the cavalry {{as little more than}} a patrol. But when, hours later, two Union cavalrymen reported seeing a large mass of infantry marching east down the Little River Turnpike, Pope realized that his army was in danger. He countermanded actions preparing for an attack and directed the army to retreat from Centreville to Washington; he also sent out a series of infantry probes up the roads that Lee might use to reach his troops as they pulled back.|$|E
25|$|By March 1865, Lee's {{army was}} {{weakened}} by desertion, disease, and {{shortage of supplies}} and he was outnumbered by Grant by about 125,000 to 50,000. Lee knew that an additional 50,000 men under Sheridan would be returning soon from the Shenandoah Valley and Sherman was marching north through the Carolinas to join Grant as well. Lee had Maj. Gen. John B. Gordon plan a surprise attack on the Union lines <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>force</b> Grant to contract his lines and disrupt his plans to assault the Confederate works (which, unbeknownst to Lee and Gordon, Grant had already ordered for March 29). The attack would be launched with almost half of Lee's infantry from Colquitt's Salient against Fort Stedman, and Gordon had hopes that he could drive into the Union rear area as far as City Point.|$|E
25|$|The Big Week (Sunday, 20–Friday, 25 February 1944) {{heavy bomber}} {{offensive}} began {{shortly after the}} Eighth Air Force commander, Maj. Gen. Jimmy Doolittle, had implemented {{a major change in}} fighter defense of USAAF strategic bomber formations that had bolstered the confidence of U.S. strategic bombing crews. Until that time, Allied bombers avoided contact with the Luftwaffe; now, the Americans used any method <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>force</b> the Luftwaffe into combat. Implementing this policy, the United States looked toward Berlin. Raiding the German capital, the USAAF reasoned, would force the Luftwaffe into battle. Consequently, on 4 March, the USSTAF launched the first of several attacks against Berlin. Fierce battles raged and resulted in heavy losses for both sides; 69 B-17s were lost on March 6 but the Luftwaffe lost 160 aircraft. The Allies replaced their losses; the Luftwaffe could not.|$|E

25|$|Opposition members led by Liberal MP Pablo Rodriguez tabled bill C-288 <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>force</b> the {{government}} to respect the measures of the Kyoto Accord and forced it to present its measures within 60 days. The bill passed third reading on February 14, 2007, 161-113. The Conservatives had appealed the Speaker of the House, Peter Milliken to make the bill invalid citing it was forcing them to spend money against its will, which was denied. While criticizing the Opposition bill as an empty law without any action plans and not giving authority to spend, Harper {{announced that he would}} respect the law, despite earlier threats by {{the government}} not to respect it. Toronto-Dominion Bank chief economist Don Drummond dismissed bill C-288 as unworkable. On April 19, 2007, Baird told the Canadian Senate environmental committee that respecting the Kyoto Accord would {{have a negative impact on}} the economic citing that Canada would return to a recession similar to the early 1980s while gas and natural gas prices would skyrocket despite a United Nations report that said that the impact would be minimal.|$|E
25|$|RCA began TV {{development}} in early 1929, after an overly optimistic Vladimir K. Zworykin convinced Sarnoff that a commercial {{version of his}} prototype system could be produced {{in a relatively short}} time for $100,000. Following what would actually be many years of additional research and millions of dollars, RCA demonstrated an all-electronic black-and-white television system at the 1939 New York World's Fair. RCA began regular experimental television broadcasting from the NBC studios to the New York metropolitan area on April 30, 1939 via station W2XBS, channel 1 (which evolved into WNBC channel 4) from a transmitter atop the Empire State Building. At the same time, RCA began selling its first television set models in various New York stores. However, the FCC had not approved the start of commercial television operations, because technical standards had not been yet been finalized. Concerned that RCA's broadcasts were an attempt to flood the market with sets <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>force</b> it to adopt RCA's current technology, the FCC stepped in to limit its broadcasts.|$|E
25|$|The Conservatives made a {{detailed}} and revised plan on April 25, 2007, after leaks {{of a speech}} {{which was supposed to}} be made by John Baird on April 26 were discovered after some Liberal MPs received a fax of the speech. The new plan seeks to stop the increase of greenhouse gas emissions before 2012 and reduce the amount as much as 20% by 2020. Targets would be imposed to industries before 2015, while home appliances would need to be more energy efficient. There were also rewards for companies that reduced the amount of emissions since 2006. On the next day, Baird announced additional measures including one <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>force</b> industries to reduce greenhouse emissions by 18 percent by 2010 while auto industries would have a mandatory fuel-efficient standard by 2011. Later in 2007, Baird revealed other plans and deadlines that industries must meet. The plan mentioned that over 700 big-polluter companies, including oil and gas, pulp and paper, electricity and iron and steel companies, will have to reduce green-house emissions by six percent from 2008 to 2010 and will have to report data on their emissions on every May 31.|$|E
