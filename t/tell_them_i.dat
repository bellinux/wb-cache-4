500|$|Mason {{has said}} he was nervous about filming Chris's coming out. Describing the scene, he said [...] "I did {{have to stand up}} in front a group of people and <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> , <b>I</b> was gay. That was a little intimidating". The actor felt that the storyline had been handled in a {{realistic}} manner and said that it shows that coming out is a difficult thing to do. Mason also spoke to a friend about his coming out experience to gain information about how long it took him to come out and how people reacted. The storyline follows Chris's struggle with his sexuality and depicts the reactions of his friends and family. It also deals with the issue of homophobia in sport. The Australian gay and lesbian newspaper, SX News said [...] "Chris is the captain of the school basketball team, but once word he's gay gets out to the other teams it turns nasty for him".|$|E
500|$|At 4:30pm Pacific Time, Nixon, Chotiner, and Rogers were {{discussing}} where {{the public should}} be told to send their responses to the speech, when a Dewey aide telephoned for Nixon. Reluctantly, suspecting {{the reason for the}} call, Chotiner brought Nixon to the phone to speak with the New York governor. Dewey told Nixon that Eisenhower's aides were unanimous that Nixon must resign, though Dewey did not agree, and that Nixon was to so state {{at the end of his}} telecast. Nixon asked what the general wanted him to do. Dewey hedged, stating that he had not spoken with the presidential candidate himself, but that the word had come from such close aides to Eisenhower that the demand had to represent the general's view. The candidate replied that it was very late for him to change his remarks; Dewey assured him he need not do so, but simply add at the end his resignation from the ticket and his insistence that Eisenhower accept it. The governor suggested he even announce his resignation from the Senate and his intent to run in the special election which would follow—the two-time losing presidential candidate was sure Nixon would be returned with a huge majority, thus vindicating him. Nixon remained silent for some time, and when Dewey asked him what he would do, the senator told him that he did not know, and if Eisenhower's aides wanted to find out, they could watch just like everyone else. Before slamming down the receiver, Nixon added, [...] "And <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> know something about politics, too!" ...|$|E

2500|$|... "The Leander {{paid off}} at Chatham {{after many years}} in China [...] Naturally {{she was in a}} bad state, and the Dockyard {{officers}} reported her as only fit for C Division of the Reserve; that is to say, she required an extensive refit, which meant landing all her stores and stripping her. This was reported to the Controller , and he wired back that the Leander was to be paid off into the A Division, meaning that no repairs were to be taken in hand, and that her name would appear in the list of ships ready for sea at forty-eight hours notice. As this was contrary to Regulations, besides being false, a further report was made to the Admiralty. Fisher replied: 'If the dockyard offers will not do as I <b>tell</b> <b>them,</b> <b>I</b> will replace them by others who will.' The Leander paid off all standing, and I was ordered to keep her defect lists and reports of the survey until the Admiralty should be pleased to order them to be taken in hand. After some months [...] Admiralty orders were received for the Leander to be commissioned by Captain Fegen for the Pacific. We reported that she was unfit to go to sea until refitted. The reply was that the Admiralty orders were to be obeyed. The Leander did commission at Chatham. She got as far as Portsmouth, where Sir Nowel Salmon was Commander-in-Chief, whom Fisher could not bully. the result was that the Leander was detained at Portsmouth to have her necessary defects made good. If anything had happened to her owing to her unseaworthy state, it would have been scandalous." ...|$|E
