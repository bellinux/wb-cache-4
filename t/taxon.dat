They were {{formerly}} grouped in the superorder Archonta, {{along with}} the treeshrews (Scandentia), colugos (Dermoptera), and the primates, because of the apparent similarities between Megachiroptera and such mammals.

5|$|Venom that is toxic only to {{a certain}} <b>taxon,</b> or {{strongly}} toxic {{only to a}} certain <b>taxon,</b> {{has been found in}} a number of snakes, suggesting that these venoms have evolved via natural selection to subdue preferred prey species. Examples of this phenomenon have been found in the Mangrove snake Boiga dendrophila, which has a venom specifically toxic to birds, {{as well as in the}} genera Echis and Sistrurus, and in sea snakes. However, while several snakes possess venom that is highly toxic to their preferred prey species, the reverse correlation is not necessarily true: the venoms of several snakes are toxic to taxa that they do not consume in high proportions. Most snake venom, for instance, is highly toxic to lizards, although the proportion of lizard prey varies among snake species. This has led researchers to suggest that toxicity to a certain <b>taxon</b> is nearly independent of toxicity to another distantly related <b>taxon.</b>|$|E

40|$|Investigations {{were carried}} out for the {{composition}} and occurrence of rotifer taxa of different forms and sizes during two distinct hydrological periods, in two environments (river and lake). Two sampling stations were established in open water of each environments. Surface samples were taken daily for 14 days. The faunistic similarity between the environments was established using Jaccard's index. One hundred and fourty three taxa were identified. The largest number of taxa was recorded in the river. Faunistic similarity between these environments was greater during high water. The planktonic taxa predominated and the difference for the non-planktonic ones was not marked. Non-planktonic taxa predominated in the river, while both types were numerous in the lake. We observed {{a larger number of}} smaller-sized taxa in both environments (> 200 µm to 600 µm in length). This was related to the shallowest depths and to current velocity, which moved benthic and periphytic taxa from the bottom and littoral zone into the water column. A composição e ocorrência dos rotíferos foi investigada during dois períodos hidrológicos distintos em dois ambientes (rio e lagoa). As coletas foram realizadas diariamente (14 dias) à superfície na região pelágica de cada ambiente. A similaridade faunística entre os ambientes foi avaliada através do índice de Jaccard.

5|$|From 1983 to 1985, Cathy A. Paris, then a {{graduate}} student, gathered specimens of A.pedatum from non-serpentine soils in the Midwest and Vermont, and from serpentine soils in New England and Canada, for biosystematic analysis. In 1988, Paris and Michael D. Windham published {{the results of}} this analysis, revealing A.pedatum in North America to be a cryptic species complex. They showed that A.pedatum sensu lato included two well-distinguished diploid taxa, one found in the Eastern woodlands, and the other found both in the Western mountains and as a disjunct on serpentine in the East. However, not all of the serpentine disjuncts proved to belong to the Western <b>taxon.</b> Several of them, including most of the specimens in Vermont, were found to be tetraploid, forming a <b>taxon</b> distinguishable from the two diploids. Isozyme banding patterns suggested that the tetraploid had arisen by hybridization between the eastern subspecies of non-serpentine woodlands and the western and serpentine <b>taxon,</b> followed by a duplication of the hybrid genome through polyploidy (allowing the chromosomes to pair and restoring sexual fertility). This allotetraploid was also morphologically intermediate between the two taxa, although it more closely resembled the serpentine <b>taxon</b> (hence its referral to var.aleuticum before Paris's work). Paris formally described the tetraploid as a new species, A.viridimontanum, in 1991, and also separated the western and serpentine <b>taxon</b> from A.pedatum as the species A.aleuticum. The type specimen of A.viridimontanum was collected from a talus slope at the old asbestos mine on Belvidere Mountain on August 28, 1985. The sequencing of several chloroplast DNA loci has revealed that the A.viridimontanum chloroplast genome most closely resembles that of A.aleuticum, suggesting that A.aleuticum was the maternal parent of A.viridimontanum.|$|E
