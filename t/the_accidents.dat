5|$|Seven of the 28 F-111Cs {{and one of}} the 15 F-111Gs were {{destroyed}} in accidents during their service with the RAAF. These accidents took the lives of 10 air crew. <b>The</b> <b>accidents</b> occurred from 1977 to 1999.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Thordendal, who {{was working}} as a carpenter, severed the tip of his left middle finger, while Haake injured his hand in a router accident. As a result, the band was unable to perform for several months. Thordendal's {{fingertip}} was later reattached, and he went on to make a full recovery. The Selfcaged EP was recorded in April and May 1994, but its release was delayed to later in 1995 due to <b>the</b> <b>accidents.</b>|$|E
5|$|In July 2009, {{more than}} 40 {{people were killed}} in a fire {{accident}} in a firecracker unit. The police traced out unregistered units and irregularities that led to the accident. In a fire accident in August 2011, seven people were killed and five were seriously injured. A similar fire accident and blast in a private unit in September 2012 killed 40 people and injured 38 others. The common reasons cited for <b>the</b> <b>accidents</b> are inadequate training of workers and supervisors involved in different stages of production and marketing of firecracker items. Other reasons are found to be overstocking of explosives, raw material and finished goods, and employment of workers in excess of the permitted strength.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>accident</b> {{remained}} a classified military secret for many years. At the time, the French military enforced {{silence on the}} French press, which reported little or nothing about <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> because it implicated French officers. The daily 'Le Figaro' devoted only 21 lines to <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> on December 17, four days after <b>the</b> <b>accident.</b>|$|R
5|$|As {{the result}} of <b>the</b> <b>accidents</b> in the 1970s and 1980s, most notably {{following}} the 1985 crash of Delta Air Lines Flight 191, in 1988 the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration mandated that all commercial aircraft have on-board wind shear detection systems by 1993. Between 1964 and 1985, wind shear directly caused or contributed to 26 major civil transport aircraft accidents in the U.S. that led to 620 deaths and 200 injuries. Since 1995, the number of major civil aircraft accidents caused by wind shear has dropped to approximately one every ten years, due to the mandated on-board detection {{as well as the}} addition of Doppler weather radar units on the ground (NEXRAD). The installation of high-resolution Terminal Doppler Weather Radar stations at many U.S. airports that are commonly affected by wind shear has further aided the ability of pilots and ground controllers to avoid wind shear conditions.|$|E
5|$|Prost {{began his}} career with McLaren (being run by Teddy Mayer) in 1980 {{alongside}} Ulsterman John Watson. On his debut in Buenos Aires he finished in sixth place earning one point, something achieved by {{only a handful of}} drivers. Prost added four more points to his tally during the season, scoring points at Interlagos, Brands Hatch and Zandvoort. Prost finished the year 15th in the Drivers' Championship, equalling points with former world champion Emerson Fittipaldi. Despite the encouraging debut season, Prost had several accidents, breaking his wrist during practice at Kyalami and suffering a concussion during practice at Watkins Glen. He also retired from the Canadian round in Montreal a week earlier because of rear suspension failure. At the end of the season, despite having two years remaining on his contract, he left McLaren and signed with Renault. Prost has said that he left because of the large number of breakages on the car and because he felt the team blamed him for some of <b>the</b> <b>accidents.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Comet {{is widely}} {{regarded}} both as an adventurous step forward and a supreme tragedy; nevertheless, the aircraft's legacy does include numerous advances in aircraft design and in accident investigations. The inquiries into <b>the</b> <b>accidents</b> that plagued the Comet 1 were {{perhaps some of the}} most extensive and revolutionary that have ever taken place, establishing precedents in accident investigation; many of the deep-sea salvage and aircraft reconstruction techniques employed have remained in use within the aviation industry. In spite of the Comet being subjected to what was then the most rigorous testing of any contemporary airliner, pressurisation and the dynamic stresses involved were not thoroughly understood {{at the time of the}} aircraft's development, nor was the concept of metal fatigue. While these lessons could be implemented on the drawing board for future aircraft, corrections could only be retroactively applied to the Comet.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>The</b> <b>accident</b> {{reporting}} {{computerized system}} {{was developed in}} this study. Prior to develop this accident computer package, this study examines <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> situation in Thailand in two parts with two scales. <b>The</b> <b>accident</b> reporting was analyzed with a macro scale, represents accident situation for a whole country, and an intermediate scale, referred to community scale. By reviewing natures of data, tasks, and related issues, the computerized system was developed as a supplementary tool for assess <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> situation in Thailand. <b>The</b> <b>accident</b> under-reporting, accident reported matching, and accident during holiday festivals can be performed to present more precisely about <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> situation in Thailand...|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>accidents</b> on {{its opening}} day gave the Liverpool and Manchester Railway {{huge amounts of}} publicity, and greatly {{increased}} {{public awareness of the}} potential of rapid transport. The L's passenger service proved immediately successful. In October the Duke of Wellington's special train was put into use as a dedicated first-class train, making four journeys each day between Liverpool and Manchester in each direction. On 4 December 1830 goods operations on the L began, with Planet hauling 75 tons of freight from Liverpool to Manchester. In {{the first six months of}} 1831 the L carried 188,726 passengers and 35,800tons of goods; in the year from the opening in September 1830 to September 1831, almost 500,000 passengers were carried. At George Stephenson's insistence new locomotives bought by the L were fitted with handbrakes from 1831.|$|E
5|$|No.82 Wing {{accepted}} {{its first}} F-111Cs in June 1973. The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Charles Read, ordered {{that the new}} aircraft be flown with great caution initially, well within operational limits, to minimise the possibility of further damage to its reputation through early attrition. No.1 Squadron was assigned 12 of the initial 24 aircraft delivered. It was No.82 Wing's lead strike force, while No.6 Squadron was primarily tasked with crew conversion training. The wing employed a centralised servicing regime, whereby all aircraft and maintenance personnel were held by No.482 Squadron, which released the F-111s in line with Nos.1 and 6Squadrons' joint flying program. In February 1981, responsibility for operating-level servicing of the F-111s {{was transferred to the}} flying squadrons, which for the first time took direct control of their F-111s. No.482 Squadron continued to provide intermediate-level servicing, while major upgrades and complex maintenance were carried out by No.3 Aircraft Depot. These two organisations merged in 1992 to form No.501 Wing, which handed over heavy maintenance of the F-111 to Boeing Australia in 2001. Between 1977 and 1993, the RAAF lost seven F-111Cs in crashes. Three of <b>the</b> <b>accidents</b> involved aircraft flown by No.1 Squadron: in August 1979, January 1986 and September 1993, the last two killing both crew members. In July 1996, No.1 Squadron took responsibility for aerial reconnaissance using specially modified RF-111Cs previously operated by No.6 Squadron. This gave No.1 Squadron five mission types: land strike, maritime strike, close air support, long-range air defence, and reconnaissance. In May 1999 the unit was again awarded the Gloucester Cup for proficiency.|$|E
25|$|A {{spate of}} {{accidents}} involving these boats occurred from late 2009 to early 2010, claiming {{the lives of}} six tourists and hurt sixty two others. <b>The</b> <b>accidents</b> occurred on decrepit boats, {{many of which were}} operating without permission with underage or unlicensed crew members. There were no ambulance boats and no first aid services on shore. Two of the cooperatives, Ángel Albino Corzo and Nandiume were suspended and fined for <b>the</b> <b>accidents,</b> taking about sixty boats out of operation. These boating accidents caused significant problems for the tourism industry.|$|E
