25|$|By 1632, Barebone {{had joined}} the semi-separatist {{congregation}} founded in 1616 by Henry Jacob, later to be led by John Lathrop and then, from 1637, by Henry Jessey. By December 1641 he had begun preaching to audiences at his premises at the Lock and Key, {{at the lower end}} of Fleet Street near Fetter Lane. On 19 December of that year, his sermon against bishops and the Book of Common Prayer attracted hostile attention from apprentices, who smashed the premises's windows. Some of Barebone's congregation were taken <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bridewell prison, others <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Counters,</b> <b>and</b> still others made their escape over the roof-tops, while the crowd was left to destroy his shop-sign.|$|R

60|$|The Jew, {{placing the}} candle on the counter, drew back the heavy bolts and {{cautiously}} opened the door. The seaman stepped in, and, {{as the other}} closed the door, vaulted on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>and</b> sat there with his legs dangling.|$|E

6000|$|One day {{early in}} the {{eighteen}} hundred and sixties, I, being then a small boy, was with my nurse, buying something in the shop of a petty newsagent, bookseller, and stationer in Camden Street, Dublin, when there entered an elderly man, weighty and solemn, who advanced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> <b>and</b> said pompously, 'Have you {{the works of the}} celebrated Buffoon?' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{three men}} left {{the bar and}} the crowd sifted through the doors in to the laneway. The manager brought the constable to the stairs to inspect {{the scene of the}} accident.

60|$|The life of Smith {{never seemed}} {{to bring him to}} any of those great turning-points that {{occurred}} {{in the lives of the}} great. True, the passing years brought some change of fortune. He was moved up in his dry-goods establishment from <b>the</b> ribbon <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> collar <b>counter,</b> from <b>the</b> collar <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gents' panting <b>counter,</b> <b>and</b> from <b>the</b> gents' panting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gents' fancy shirting. Then, as he grew aged and inefficient, they moved him down again from the gents' fancy shirting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gents' panting, and so on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ribbon <b>counter.</b> <b>And</b> when he grew quite old they dismissed him and got a boy with a four-inch mouth and sandy-coloured hair, who did all Smith could do for half the money. That was John Smith's mercantile career: it won't stand comparison with Mr. Gladstone's, but it's not unlike your own.|$|R

6000|$|... "Here's {{the very}} man I'm waiting for, at last," [...] said Daly, when, from his {{position}} on the stool, he saw, through the two open doors, the bloated red face of Barry Lynch approaching; and, giving an impulse to his body by a shove against the wall behind him, he raised himself on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> <b>and,</b> assisting himself by a pull at the collar of the frieze coat of the farmer who {{was in the middle of}} his story, jumped to the ground, and met his client at the front door.|$|E
60|$|When {{he reached}} the shop, the hunchback was at the door, with the tin tobacco-box in his hand. On this occasion, not a single word was {{exchanged}} between the two. The squalid shopman, as the customer approached, rattled something significantly inside the box, and then handed it to Mat; and Mat put his finger and thumb into his waistcoat pocket, winked, nodded, and handed some money to the squalid shopman. The brief ceremony of giving and taking thus completed, these two originals turned {{away from each other}} without a word of farewell; the hunchback returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> <b>and</b> his customer proceeding to the shaving shop.|$|E
50|$|Ernest settled {{permanently}} in Glatz in 1556. He did not resume hist former economic and business activities. Although {{he no longer}} held an ecclesiastical office, he committed himself <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Counter</b> Reformation <b>and</b> in 1558, he and Emperor Ferdinand I, called a synod. The primary aim of this synod was <b>to</b> test <b>the</b> beliefs of the clergy. A questionnaire had been developed by the Cistercian abbots John of Grüssau and Leonhard of Fürstenfeld.|$|R

60|$|The referees at once gave it {{as their}} decided opinion that the {{business}} could not be legally proceeded with, under the letter W., and in all probability it would have stood over for one day at least, {{had it not been}} for the prompt, though, at first sight, undutiful behaviour of Sam, who, seizing his father by the skirt of the coat, dragged him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> <b>and</b> pinned him there, until he had affixed his signature to a couple of instruments; which, from Mr. Weller's habit of printing, was a work of so much labour and time, that the officiating clerk peeled and ate three Ribstone pippins while it was performing.|$|E
6000|$|We arrived, {{and pressed}} {{with the crowd}} into the immense custom-house, and the usual worries began; {{everybody}} crowding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>and</b> begging to have his baggage examined first, and all hands clattering and chattering at once. It {{seemed to me that}} I could do nothing; {{it would be better to}} give it all up and go away and leave the baggage. I couldn't speak the language; I should never accomplish anything. Just then a tall handsome man in a fine uniform was passing by and I knew he must be the station-master--and that reminded me of my letter. I ran to him and put it into his hands. He took it out of the envelope, and the moment his eye caught the royal coat of arms printed at its top, he took off his cap and made a beautiful bow to me, and said in English: ...|$|E
6000|$|MY DEAR HOWELLS,--..... Here's a secret. A most {{curious and}} pathetic romance, {{which has just}} come to light. Read these things, but don't mention them. Last fall, my old mother--then 82--took a notion to attend a {{convention}} of old settlers of the Mississippi Valley in an Iowa town. My brother's wife was astonished; and represented to her the hardships and fatigues of such a trip, and said my mother might possibly not even survive them; and said {{there could be no}} possible interest for her in such a meeting and such a crowd. But my mother insisted, and persisted; and finally gained her point. They started; and all the way my mother was young again with excitement, interest, eagerness, anticipation. They reached the town and the hotel. My mother strode with the same eagerness in her eye and her step, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> <b>and</b> said: ...|$|E

6000|$|Now {{the whole}} of this passage is admirably {{characteristic}} of the new journalism which Mr. Pearson represents, the new journalism which has just purchased the Standard. To take one instance out of hundreds, the incomparable man with the board and nails is described in the Pearson's article as calling out (as he smote the symbolic nail), [...] "Lie number one. Nailed to the Mast! Nailed to the Mast!" [...] In {{the whole of}}fice there was apparently no compositor or office-boy {{to point out that}} we speak of lies being nailed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> <b>and</b> not to the mast. Nobody in the office knew that Pearson's Magazine was falling into a stale Irish bull, which must be as old as St. Patrick. This is the real and essential tragedy of the sale of the Standard. It is not merely that journalism is victorious over literature. It is that bad journalism is victorious over good journalism.|$|E

I attracted my brother's attention by signs, pointed to the floating barrels that came near us, and did {{everything in my power}} to make him understand what I was about to do. I thought at length that he comprehended my design--but, whether this was the case or not, he shook his head despairingly, and refused to move from his station by the ring-bolt. It was impossible to reach him; the emergency admitted of no delay; and so, with a bitter struggle, I resigned him to his fate, fastened myself to the cask by means of the lashings which secured it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> <b>and</b> precipitated myself with it into the sea, without another moment's hesitation.|$|E
6000|$|Black Tom's, to the front, {{presented}} {{the appearance of}} a fourth-rate saloon, devoted to Kanaka seamen, dirt, negrohead tobacco, bad cigars, worse gin, and guitars and banjos in a state of decline. The proprietor, a powerful coloured man, was at once a publican, a ward politician, leader of some brigade of [...] "lambs" [...] or [...] "smashers," [...] at the wind of whose clubs the party bosses and the mayor were supposed to tremble, and (what hurt nothing) an active and reliable crimp. His front quarters, then, were noisy, disreputable, and not even safe. I have seen worse-frequented saloons where there were fewer scandals; for Tom was often drunk himself: and there is no doubt the Lambs must have been a useful body, or the place would have been closed. I remember one day, not long before an election, seeing a blind man, very well dressed, led up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>and</b> remain a long while in consultation with the negro. The pair looked so ill-assorted, and the awe with which the drinkers fell back and left them {{in the midst of an}} impromptu privacy was so unusual in such a place, that I turned to my next neighbour with a question. He told me the blind man was a distinguished party boss, called by some the King of San Francisco, but perhaps better known by his picturesque Chinese nickname of the Blind White Devil. [...] "The Lambs must be wanted pretty bad, I guess," [...] my informant added. I have here a sketch of the Blind White Devil leaning on the counter; on the next page, and taken the same hour, a jotting of Black Tom threatening a whole crowd of customers with a long Smith and Wesson--to such heights and depths we rose and fell in the front parts of the saloon! ...|$|E
