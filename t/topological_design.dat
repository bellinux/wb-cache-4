40|$|The elastic {{properties}} of mechanical metamaterials are direct functions of their <b>topological</b> <b>designs.</b> Rational design approaches based on computational models could, therefore, {{be used to}} devise <b>topological</b> <b>designs</b> that result in the desired properties. It is of particular importance to independently tailor the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of metamaterials. Here, we present patterned randomness as a strategy for independent tailoring of both properties. Soft mechanical metamaterials incorporating various types of patterned randomness were fabricated using an indirect additive manufacturing technique and mechanically tested. Computational models were also developed to predict the topology-property relationship {{in a wide range}} of proposed topologies. The results of this study show that patterned randomness allows for independent tailoring of the elastic properties and covering a broad area of the elastic modulus-Poisson's ratio plane.

40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} (AM) techniques enable {{fabrication of}} bone-mimicking meta-biomaterials with unprecedented combinations of topological, mechanical, and mass transport properties. The mechanical performance of AM meta-biomaterials {{is a direct}} function of their <b>topological</b> <b>design.</b> It is, however, not clear {{to what extent the}} material type is important in determining the fatigue behavior of such biomaterials. We therefore aimed to determine the isolated and modulated effects of <b>topological</b> <b>design</b> and material type on the fatigue response of metallic meta-biomaterials fabricated with selective laser melting. Towards that end, we designed and additively manufactured Co-Cr meta-biomaterials with three types of repeating unit cells and three to four porosities per type of repeating unit cell. The AM meta-biomaterials were then mechanically tested to obtain their normalized S-N curves. The obtained S-N curves of Co-Cr meta-biomaterials were compared to those of meta-biomaterials with same topological designs but made from other materials, i. e. Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, tantalum, and pure titanium, available from our previous studies. We found the material type to be far more important than the <b>topological</b> <b>design</b> in determining the normalized fatigue strength of our AM metallic meta-biomaterials. This is the opposite of what we have found for the quasi-static mechanical properties of the same meta-biomaterials. The effects of material type, manufacturing imperfections, and <b>topological</b> <b>design</b> were different in the high and low cycle fatigue regions. That is likely because the cyclic response of meta-biomaterials depends not only on the static and fatigue strengths of the bulk material but also on other factors that may include strut roughness, distribution of the micro-pores created inside the struts during the AM process, and plasticity. Statement of significance: Meta-biomaterials are a special class of metamaterials with unusual or unprecedented combinations of mechanical, physical (e. g. mass transport), and biological properties. Topologically complex and additively manufactured meta-biomaterials have been shown to improve bone regeneration and osseointegration. The mechanical properties of such biomaterials are directly related to their <b>topological</b> <b>design</b> and material type. However, previous studies of such biomaterials have largely neglected the effects of material type, instead focusing on <b>topological</b> <b>design.</b> We show here that neglecting the effects of material type is unjustified. We studied the isolated and combined effects of <b>topological</b> <b>design</b> and material type on the normalized S-N curves of metallic bone-mimicking biomaterials and found them to be more strongly dependent on the material type than <b>topological</b> <b>design.</b> Accepted Author ManuscriptMSE- 5 Biomaterials & Tissue BiomechanicsBT/BiocatalysisStructural Integrity & Composite...|$|E

40|$|A new {{approach}} for generating stress-constrained <b>topological</b> <b>designs</b> in continua is presented. The main novelty {{is in the}} use of elasto-plastic modeling and in optimizing the design such that it will exhibit a linear-elastic response. This is achieved by imposing a single global constraint on the total sum of equivalent plastic strains, providing accurate control over all local stress violations. The single constraint essentially replaces a large number of local stress constraints or an approximate aggregation of them [...] two common approaches in the literature. A classical rate-independent plasticity model is utilized, for which analytical adjoint sensitivity analysis is derived and verified. Several examples demonstrate the capability of the computational procedure to generate designs that challenge results from the literature, in terms of the obtained stiffness-strength-weight trade-offs. A full elasto-plastic analysis of the optimized designs shows that prior to the initial yielding, these designs can sustain significantly higher loads than minimum compliance topological layouts, with only a minor compromise on stiffness...|$|R

The problem is to interconnect (a subset of) the nodes such that there is a path between every pair of nodes while minimizing the total cost of selected edges. Originally, the Steiner tree problem was stated as a purely geometric problem: Given a set of points (terminals) in the plane, construct a tree interconnecting all terminals such that the total length of all line segments is minimized. In the Euclidean Steiner tree problem, the length of a line segment is the usual Euclidean (or L 2) distance between the endpoints of the segment.
