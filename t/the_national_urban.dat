5|$|In mid-1967, New York City mayor John Lindsay {{sought to}} develop closer ties {{with leaders of}} impoverished neighborhoods. Prompted in part by {{concerns}} voiced by the New York Police Department (NYPD), the mayor dispatched one of his aides, Barry Gottehrer, to meet with Clarence13X. Belying his fearsome reputation, Clarence13X had a congenial meeting with Gottehrer, during which he requested more bus routes and school funding. Clarence13X subsequently attended a meeting of black leaders at Gracie Mansion, the mayor's official residence. The city provided buses for Five Percenters to travel to a Long Island park, and with help from <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Urban</b> League, obtained an abandoned storefront {{for use as a}} school. It became known as the Allah School in Mecca and aimed to prepare young people for college preparatory schools. Tensions soon formed between the Five Percenters and the school's overseers; Clarence13X desired more control over the curriculum and had difficulty finding qualified teachers. Police regularly visited the school to ensure that the students were not being radicalized. In 1975, Gottehrer chronicled his friendship with Clarence13X in The Mayor's Man. The book was well received by some Five Percenters, who republished portions of it after it went out of print. They have not reprinted the entire book, owing to a passage in which Gottehrer relates that Clarence13X offered to allow him to sleep with his teenage daughter.|$|E
