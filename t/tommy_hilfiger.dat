40|$|The {{majority}} of contemporary fashion encompasses a vast middle ground comprised of popular and influential brands whose designs are neither haute couture nor trendy. These mass-market brands rely on intensive marketing and advertising to evoke ideals of an American {{national identity and}} lifestyle. In this article, we employ a holistic analysis of Ralph Lauren and <b>Tommy</b> <b>Hilfiger's</b> lifestyle branding strategies aimed at creating coherent American mythologies, Gap, J. Crew, Abercrombie & Fitch and Hollister's less coherent approach and American Apparel's new 'authenticity' in its portrayal of American ideals. In their respective branding strategies, each of the brands constructs a hyperreal American world based on appearances and associations, in which contradictory ideologies are conflated and consumed by global audiences. The companies produce coherent systems of signification through advertising and promotional strategies in which consumers are invited {{to become a part}} of their mythological constructs. Through the kaleidoscopic lens of the production-branding-consumption cycle, an examination of several mass-market brands exposes variations on American national identity and differing responses to broader cultural and political changes over the last four decades...|$|R
25|$|Seal skins {{have been}} used by {{aboriginal}} people for millennia to make waterproof jackets and boots, and seal fur to make fur coats. Pelts account for over half the processed value of a seal, selling at over C$100 each as of 2006. According to Paul Christian Rieber, of GC Rieber AS, the difficult ice conditions and low quotas in 2006 resulted in less access to seal pelts, which caused the commodity price to be pushed up. One high-end fashion designer, Donatella Versace, has begun to use seal pelts, while others, such as Calvin Klein, Stella McCartney, <b>Tommy</b> <b>Hilfiger,</b> and Ralph Lauren, refrain from using any kind of fur.|$|E

40|$|Organizations {{frequently}} {{find themselves}} in situations we would define as a crisis. Consider but a few examples: Union Carbide’s devastating chemical release in Bhopal; Carrefour suffering from protests at its stores in China because of French attacks on the Olympic torch relay; customers experiencing E. coli at Taco Bell; rumors about designer <b>Tommy</b> <b>Hilfiger’s</b> racist comments; Tyco executives steal-ing millions from the company; and Oxfam claiming Starbucks did not support coffee growers by opposing the branding of certain African coffees. We must accept that no organization is immune from a crisis {{anywhere in the world}} even if that organization is vigilant and actively seeks to prevent crises. The reality of crises leads to the need for preparation and readiness to respond – crisis management. The critical component in crisis management is communi-cation. Over the past decade, there has been a massive increase in crisis communi-cation research. As the field of crisis communication develops, it is important to develop parameters for that growth. This chapter and the Handbook of Crisis Communication are steps towards articulating the parameters and utility of crisis communication. The focus in this book is the research used to advance our under-standing of communication’s role in the crisis management process. To properly set the stage for this collection, it is important to define key terms in crisis manage-ment and overview key research on the central theme of crisis communication. By examining these fundamental elements, the parameters of crisis communication begin to emerge. Key Definitions for Crisis Because of the diversity of crisis research, it is important to present definitions of key crisis terms early to help set boundaries. The key terms for the Handbook include crisis, crisis management, and crisis communication. The three are inex-tricably interconnected and must be considered in a progression from crisis t...|$|R
