5|$|A Marvel One-Shot {{featuring}} Peggy Carter was in <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>for</b> {{some time}} before Atwell signed on to star in it, reprising her role from the Captain America films. D'Esposito, co-president of Marvel Studios and an executive producer on the feature films, aimed to replicate the period setting of Captain America: The First Avenger, while also giving the short a more modern, superhero feel. The film was a more ambitious production than previous One-Shots, with more action scenes and visual effects required than previously. Several other characters from Marvel Cinematic Universe films also appear, including Cooper reprising his role of Howard Stark.|$|E

5|$|In July 2010, it was {{confirmed}} that an IRIS graphic novel was in <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>for</b> a Fall 2011 release.

Launching first in Japan and later in Korea, the graphic novel retained the relationship between the male and female leads but deviates from the scenarios featured in the original story.|$|E
5|$|In February 1919, {{with the}} war over, the C {{submitted}} a new bill that included provisions for an extension of time for the tunnel enlargement works approved {{in the act of}} 1913. The resulting act was passed on 19 August 1919 as the City and South London Railway Act, 1919. In 1920, under special wartime provisions, the LER was granted an extension of time to carry out <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>for</b> its own 1913 act. Although the permissions to carry out the works had been renewed, the Underground companies were {{not in a position to}} raise the funds needed to pay for the works. Construction costs had increased considerably during the war years and the returns produced by the companies could not cover the cost of repaying borrowed capital.|$|E

25|$|Little {{is known}} of Schutz' last years. He appears to have survived the Frobisher debacle {{relatively}} unscathed, although investors, including a number of prominent courtiers, lost £20,000, and the lawsuits which followed ruined one of the scheme's principal proponents, Michael Lok. The Dartford furnace was eventually sold, and by 1586 had become England's first paper mill {{under the auspices of}} John Spilman. Schutz {{is said to have been}} employed by King James of Scotland as Master of <b>the</b> <b>Works</b> <b>for</b> Ores from Cathay and the North West Parts, and to have been replaced in that position by Act of the Scottish Parliament in 1593 by Bevis Bulmer.|$|E
25|$|The Baldwin Locomotive Works had {{a humble}} beginning. Matthias W. Baldwin, the founder, was a {{jeweller}} and whitesmith, who, in 1825, formed {{a partnership with}} a machinist, and engaged {{in the manufacture of}} bookbinders' tools and cylinders for calico printing. Baldwin then designed and constructed for his own use a small stationary engine, the workmanship of which was so excellent and its efficiency so great that he was solicited to build others like it for various parties, and thus led to turn his attention to steam engineering. The original engine was in use and powered many departments of <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>for</b> well over 60 years, and is currently on display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC.|$|E

25|$|The Fauvism of Matisse and Derain was {{practically}} {{over by the}} spring of the 1907 Salon des Indépendants. And by the Salon d'Automne in the fall of 1907 it had ended for many others as well. The shift from expressing bright pure colors loosely applied to the canvas gave way to a more calculated geometric approach. Simplified form began to overtake the representational aspect of <b>the</b> <b>works.</b> <b>For</b> Metzinger and Delaunay, too, representational form gave way to a new complexity; {{the subject matter of the}} paintings progressively became dominated by a network of interconnected geometric planes, the distinction between foreground and background no longer sharply delineated, and the depth of field limited. And Picasso had almost completed Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.|$|E
25|$|It was {{originally}} intended {{primarily for the}} transport of tobacco from the interior to the coast for export. The first line built was a 32kilometres track from Bukau River, north to Beaufort, and south to the port of Weston. This was then extended with a further 48kilometres route in 1903 to Tenom, <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>for</b> which was completed in 1905. The line was extended again in 1906 with a further 16kilometres from Tenom to Melalap with workers brought from China. At {{the same time as}} this, work began on another line from Beaufort to Jesselton (now known as Kota Kinabalu), which was completed in 1903, running mostly near or beside the coast. With the completion of these works the network routes covered some 193kilometres.|$|E
25|$|In July 1852 {{a public}} meeting {{took place in}} East Grinstead to discuss the {{setting-up}} of a railway company which would build a line to Three Bridges. The majority of landowners affected were in favour and a contractor, a Mr Hale, agreed to carry out <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>for</b> £40,000. Unfortunately, {{he was killed in}} accident shortly afterwards. A company, the East Grinstead Railway Company (EGR), was incorporated in November to promote a bill authorising a railway between Three Bridges and East Grinstead. The bill was not opposed by the LBR which was more than happy for a third party to bear the construction costs; furthermore, the LBR ensured that a provision was inserted in the bill allowing it to purchase the line at any time within ten years of construction, and until then to pay the EGR an annual rental of £2,000 while it worked the line on their behalf.|$|E
