40|$|The {{development}} of eight-node arbitrary quadrilateral membrane elements with drilling {{degrees of freedom}} is presented using the compatible displacement interpolation within the element. The element is considered to develop specifically for analysing the in-plane stiffness of <b>thick</b> <b>floor</b> <b>plates</b> in building systems, particularly the transfer plates in tall buildings as well as pile caps. With {{a new set of}} shape functions and following the displacement-based element procedure, the element stiffness and force vector are derived and nodal displacements are obtained after solving the simultaneous equations; the element stresses are then determined. A wide range of patch tests is conducted to evaluate the consistency and stability of the proposed element. The test results show very good agreement with the exact solutions of the beam theory. Numerical investigations are carried out, showing that the analyses using the proposed elements provide better results than those from the existing methods.

To elucidate the regulatory mechanisms underlying expression in the <b>floor</b> <b>plate,</b> we scanned the netrin 1 locus for regulatory regions and identified an enhancer that drives expression in the <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> and hypochord of transgenic embryos. The expression of the transgene is ectopically activated by Cyclops (Nodal) signals but does not respond to Hedgehog signals. The winged-helix transcription factor foxA 2 (also HNF 3 β, axial) is expressed in the notochord and <b>floor</b> <b>plate.</b> We show that knock-down of FoxA 2 leads to loss of <b>floor</b> <b>plate,</b> while notochord and hypochord development is unaffected, suggesting a specific requirement of FoxA 2 in the <b>floor</b> <b>plate.</b> The transgene is ectopically activated by FoxA 2, and expression of FoxA 2 leads to rescue of <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> differentiation in mutant embryos that are deficient in Cyclops signalling. Zebrafish and mouse use different signalling systems to specify <b>floor</b> <b>plate.</b> The zebrafish netrin 1 regulatory region also drives expression in the <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> of mouse and chicken embryos.

5000|$|Induction of the <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> during {{embryogenesis}} of vertebrate embryos {{has been}} studied extensively in chick and zebrafish and {{occurs as a result}} of a complex signaling network among tissues, the details of which have yet to be fully refined. Currently there are several competing lines of thought. First, <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> differentiation may be mediated by inductive signaling from the underlying notochord, an axial mesoderm derived signaling structure. This is supported experimentally in chick, in which <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> induction, as well as associative ventral nervous tissue differentiation, is mediated by the secreted signaling molecule Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Shh is expressed in a gradient with highest concentration localized in the notochord and <b>floor</b> <b>plate.</b> In vitro tissue grafting experiments show that removal of this molecule prevents differentiation of the <b>floor</b> <b>plate,</b> whereas its ectopic expression induces differentiation of <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells. [...] An alternative view proposes that neural tube <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells stem from precursor cells which migrate directly from axial mesoderm. Through chick - quail hybrid experiments as well as genetic interaction experiments in zebrafish, it appears that notochord and <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells originate from a common precursor. Furthermore, in zebrafish, Nodal signaling is required for differentiation of medial <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells whereas Shh is expendable. These data may indicate that the <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> induction mechanism in amniotes and anamniotes differs. [...] To reconcile these differences, a dual-mode induction model has been proposed in chick. In this model, exclusively ectodermal cells are induced to become medial <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> during gastrulation by prechordal mesoderm, possibly through Nodal signaling. Later in development during neurulation, extended contact and interaction between notochord and fated <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells causes differentiation, suggesting a cooperative effect between Nodal and Shh signaling.|$|R
40|$|To {{begin to}} {{reconcile}} models of <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> {{formation in the}} vertebrate neural tube, we have performed experiments aimed at understanding {{the development of the}} early <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> in the chick embryo. Using real-time analyses of cell behaviour, we provide evidence that the principal contributor to the early neural midline, the future anterior <b>floor</b> <b>plate,</b> exists as a separate population of <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> precursor cells in the epiblast of the gastrula stage embryo, and does not share a lineage with axial mesoderm. Analysis of the tissue interactions associated with differentiation of these cells to a <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> fate reveals a role for the nascent prechordal mesoderm, indicating that more than one inductive event is associated with <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> formation {{along the length of the}} neuraxis. We show that Nr 1, a chick nodal homologue, is expressed in the nascent prechordal mesoderm and we provide evidence that Nodal signalling can cooperate with Shh to induce the epiblast precursors to a floor-plate fate. These results indicate that a shared lineage with axial mesoderm cells is not a pre-requisite for <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> differentiation and suggest parallels between the development of the <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> in amniote and anamniote embryos...|$|R

Using human embryonic stem cells (hESC) as a model of neurogenesis, we sought to determine how <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells may be temporarily specified by SHH signaling during human embryogenesis. We found that inhibition of both GSK 3 β and activin/nodal pathways in hESC induces a cellular state of SOX 2 +/PAX 6 - expression, we describe as "pre-neuroepithelial. " Exposure of SHH during this pre-neuroepithelial period causes the expression of GLI transcription factors to function as activators and consequently upregulate expression of the <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> marker, FOXA 2, while also supressing PAX 6 expression to inhibit neuroepithelial fate.

40|$|By {{using the}} quail–chicken chimera system, we have {{previously}} shown that during {{development of the}} spinal cord, <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells are inserted between neural progenitors giving rise to the alar plates.

40|$|AbstractBackground: The {{differentiation}} of <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells and motor neurons in the vertebrate neural tube {{appears to be}} induced by signals from the notochord. The secreted protein encoded by the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) gene is expressed by axial midline cells and can induce <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells in vivo and in vitro. Motor neurons can also be induced in vitro by cells that synthesize Sonic hedgehog protein (Shh). It remains unclear, however, if the motor-neuron-inducing activity of Shh depends on the synthesis of a distinct signaling molecule by <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells. To resolve this issue, we have developed an in vitro assay which uncouples the notochord-mediated induction of motor neurons from <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> differentiation, and have used this assay to examine whether Shh induces motor neurons {{in the absence of}} <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> differentiation. Results <b>Floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells and motor neurons were induced in neural plate explants grown in contact with the notochord, but only motor neurons were induced when explants were separated from the notochord. COS cells transfected with Shh induced both <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells and motor neurons when grown in contact with neural plate explants, whereas only motor neurons were induced when the explants were grown at a distance from Shh-transfected COS cells. Direct transfection of neural plate cells with an Shh-expression construct induced both <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells and motor neurons, with motor neuron differentiation occurring prior to, or coincidentally with, <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> differentiation. The induction of motor neurons appears, therefore, not to depend on <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> differentiation. Conclusion The induction of motor neurons by Shh does not depend on distinct floor-plate-derived signaling molecules. Shh can, therefore, initiate the {{differentiation of}} two cell types that are generated in the ventral region of the neural tube. These results show that the early development of motor neurons involves the inductive action of Shh, whereas the survival of motor neurons at later stages of embryonic development requires neurotrophic factors...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of the vertebrate dorsal midline (<b>floor</b> <b>plate,</b> notochord, and hypochord) has been an area of classical research and debate. Previous studies in vertebrates have led to contrasting models for the roles of Shh and Notch signaling in specification of the <b>floor</b> <b>plate,</b> by late inductive or early allocation mechanisms, respectively. Here, we show that Notch signaling plays an integral role in cell fate decisions in the dorsal midline of Xenopus laevis, similar to that observed in zebrafish and chick. Notch signaling promotes <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> and hypochord fates over notochord, but has variable effects on Shh expression in the midline. In contrast to previous reports in frog, we find that Shh signaling is not required for <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> vs. notochord decisions and plays a minor role in <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> specification, where it acts in parallel to Notch signaling. As in zebrafish, Shh signaling is required for specification of the lateral <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> in the frog. We also find that the medial <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> in Xenopus comprises two distinct populations of cells, each dependent upon different signals for its specification. Using expression analysis of several midline markers, and dissection of functional relationships, we propose a revised allocation mechanism of dorsal midline specification in Xenopus. Our model is distinct from those proposed to date, and {{may serve as a}} guide for future studies in frog and other vertebrate organisms...|$|R

It {{has been shown that}} the <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> is conserved among vertebrates with homologous structures in invertebrates such as the fruit fly Drosophila and the nematode C. elegans. Functionally, the structure serves as an organizer to ventralize tissues in the embryo as well as to guide neuronal positioning and differentiation along the dorsoventral axis of the neural tube.|$|R
50|$|The ventral neural tube is {{patterned}} by Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) {{from the}} notochord, which {{acts as the}} inducing tissue. Notochord-derived Shh signals to the <b>floor</b> <b>plate,</b> and induces Shh expression in the <b>floor</b> <b>plate.</b> <b>Floor</b> plate-derived Shh subsequently signals to other cells in the neural tube, and is essential for proper specification of ventral neuron progenitor domains. Loss of Shh from the notochord and/or <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> prevents proper specification of these progenitor domains. Shh binds Patched1, relieving Patched-mediated inhibition of Smoothened, leading to activation of Gli family of transcription factors (Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3) transcription factors.|$|R
50|$|Slit: Slit is a {{secreted}} ligand {{expressed in}} the <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> and functions to inhibit axonal crossing of the neural tube. While netrins attract commissural neurons toward the midline, slit proteins repel and expel neurons from the midline. As axons not destined to cross the midline project through the neural tube they are repelled by the ligand slit which is {{expressed in the}} cells of the <b>floor</b> <b>plate.</b> Slit acts through its receptors Roundabout (Robo) 1 and 2. This interaction inhibits the chemotaxis provided by the Netrin/DCC pathway. However, Robo-3 (Rig-1) is upregulated during growth of commissural axons during migration toward the <b>floor</b> <b>plate,</b> which sequesters Robo-1/2 inside the cell within vesicles. Consequently, the Netrin/DCC attraction pathway dominates over the Slit/Robo repulsion pathway and the axon can grow toward the midline and enter the <b>floor</b> <b>plate.</b> Upon entering, through a mechanism not yet fully understood, Robo-3 becomes downregulated and this liberates and upregulates Robo-1/2, effectively repelling the neuron from the <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> midline. Through this complex cross talk of Slit, Robo-1/2, and Robo-3, commissural axons are guided toward the midline to cross the neural tube and prevented from crossing back.|$|R
50|$|Initially, {{the left}} and right sides of the basal plate are continuous, but during neurulation they become {{separated}} by the <b>floor</b> <b>plate,</b> and this process is directed by the notochord. Differentiation of neurons in the basal plate is {{under the influence of the}} protein Sonic hedgehog released by ventralizing structures, such as the notochord and <b>floor</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|R
25|$|Sonic {{hedgehog}} is the secreted protein which mediates signaling {{activities of}} the notochord and <b>floor</b> <b>plate.</b> Studies involving ectopic expression of SHH in vitro and in vivo result in <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> induction, and differentiation of motor neuron and ventral interneurons. On the other hand, mice mutant for SHH lack ventral spinal cord characteristics.In vitro blocking of SHH signaling using antibodies against it shows similar phenotypes. SHH exerts its effects in a concentration-dependent manner, so that {{a high concentration of}} SHH results in a local inhibition of cellular proliferation. This inhibition causes the <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> to become thin compared to the lateral regions of the neural tube. Lower concentration of SHH results in cellular proliferation and induction of various ventral neural cell types. Once the <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> is established, cells residing in this region will subsequently express SHH themselves generating a concentration gradient within the neural tube.|$|R
40|$|AbstractExtending axons {{are guided}} {{in part by}} diffusible chemoattractants that lure them to their targets and by diffusible chemorepellents that keep them away from nontarget regions. <b>Floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells at the ventral midline of the neural tube express a diffusible chemoattractant, netrin- 1, that attracts a group of ventrally {{directed}} axons. Here we report that <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells also have a long-range repulsive effect {{on a set of}} axons, trochlear motor axons, that grow dorsally away from the <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> in vivo. COS cells secreting recombinant netrin- 1 mimic this effect, suggesting that netrin- 1 is a bifunctional guidance cue that simultaneously attracts some axons to the <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> while steering others away. This bifunctionality of netrin- 1 in vertebrates mirrors the dual actions of UNC- 6, a C. elegans homolog of netrin- 1, which is involved in guiding both dorsal and ventral migrations in the nematode...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDeveloping axons {{are guided}} to their targets by {{attractive}} and repulsive guidance cues. In the embryonic spinal cord, the <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> chemoattractant Netrin- 1 {{is required to}} guide commissural neuron axons to the midline. However, genetic evidence suggests that other chemoattractant(s) are also involved. We show that the morphogen Sonic hedgehog (Shh) can mimic the additional chemoattractant activity of the <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> in vitro and can act directly as a chemoattractant on isolated axons. Cyclopamine-mediated inhibition of the Shh signaling mediator Smoothened (Smo) or conditional inactivation of Smo in commissural neurons indicate that Smo activity {{is important for the}} additional chemoattractant activity of the <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> in vitro and for the normal projection of commissural axons to the <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> in vivo. These results provide evidence that Shh, acting via Smo, is a midline-derived chemoattractant for commissural axons and show that a morphogen can also act as an axonal chemoattractant...|$|R
