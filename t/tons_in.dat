5|$|In 1996, Japan ranked {{fourth in}} the world in tonnage of fish caught. Japan {{captured}} 4,074,580 metric tons of fish in 2005, down from 4,987,703 <b>tons</b> <b>in</b> 2000, 9,558,615 <b>tons</b> <b>in</b> 1990, 9,864,422 <b>tons</b> <b>in</b> 1980, 8,520,397 <b>tons</b> <b>in</b> 1970, 5,583,796 <b>tons</b> <b>in</b> 1960 and 2,881,855 <b>tons</b> <b>in</b> 1950. In 2003, the total aquaculture production was predicted at 1,301,437 tonnes. In 2010, Japan's total fisheries production was 4,762,469 fish. Offshore fisheries accounted for an average of 50% of the nation's total fish catches in the late 1980s although they experienced repeated ups and downs during that period.|$|E
5|$|Intensive {{fishing for}} the {{porbeagle}} dates back the 1930s, when Norway {{and to a}} lesser extent Denmark began operating longline vessels in the Northeast Atlantic. The Norwegian annual catch rose from 279 <b>tons</b> <b>in</b> 1926 to 3,884 <b>tons</b> <b>in</b> 1933, and peaked at around 6,000 <b>tons</b> <b>in</b> 1947, with the resumption of fishing after World War II. Soon after the stock collapsed: Norwegian annual catches declined steadily to 1,200–1,900 tons from 1953 to 1960, 160–300 <b>tons</b> <b>in</b> the early 1970s, and 10–40 <b>tons</b> <b>in</b> the late 1980s to early 1990s. Similarly, Danish annual catches fell from 1,500 <b>tons</b> <b>in</b> the early 1950s to under 100 <b>tons</b> <b>in</b> the 1990s. France and Spain began to target porbeagles in the Northeast Atlantic in the 1970s. French fishers operate mainly in the Celtic Sea and the Bay of Biscay, and saw a decline from an annual catch of over 1,000 <b>tons</b> <b>in</b> 1979 to 300–400 <b>tons</b> <b>in</b> the late 1990s. Catches by Spanish fishers were highly variable, ranging from negligible to over 4,000 tons per year, which may reflect shifts of fishing effort into historically less-exploited waters. Since 2011, all fishing for the porbeagle has been illegal in waters of the European Union and EU-registered vessels are also prohibited from fishing for the species in international waters. In 2012, similar restriction came into effect in Norway.|$|E

Until {{the end of the}} 19th century the {{municipality}} of Givors held that the canal was essential to development of the town, and that barge traffic was still a viable industry, fighting against closure of the canal and demanding that it remain navigable for its entire length despite mounting evidence that it was obsolete. However, by 1881, {{it was clear that the}} canal was in poor shape. The natural shores were eroded and the sides of locks 1–32 needed to be completely rebuilt. From locks 32 to 35 the canal was mostly silted up and in some places had disappeared completely, taken over by vegetable gardens.|$|E

5|$|Mercury also {{enters into}} the {{environment}} through the improper disposal (e.g., land filling, incineration) of certain products. Products containing mercury include: auto parts, batteries, fluorescent bulbs, medical products, thermometers, and thermostats. Due to health concerns (see below), toxics use reduction efforts are cutting back or eliminating mercury in such products.

5|$|As the Allies {{advanced}} towards Japan, conditions became steadily {{worse for}} the Japanese people. Japan's merchant fleet declined from 5,250,000 gross <b>tons</b> <b>in</b> 1941 to 1,560,000 <b>tons</b> <b>in</b> March 1945, and 557,000 <b>tons</b> <b>in</b> August 1945. Lack of raw materials forced the Japanese war economy into a steep decline after the middle of 1944. The civilian economy, which had slowly deteriorated throughout the war, reached disastrous levels {{by the middle of}} 1945. The loss of shipping also affected the fishing fleet, and the 1945 catch was only 22% of that in 1941. The 1945 rice harvest was the worst since 1909, and hunger and malnutrition became widespread. U.S. industrial production was overwhelmingly superior to Japan's. By 1943, the U.S. produced almost 100,000 aircraft a year, compared to Japan's production of 70,000 for the entire war. By the middle of 1944, the U.S. had almost a hundred aircraft carriers in the Pacific, far more than Japan's twenty-five for the entire war. In February 1945, Prince Fumimaro Konoe advised the Emperor Hirohito that defeat was inevitable, and urged him to abdicate.|$|E
5|$|By 1972 FANK was decimated, {{the road}} and rail {{networks}} were smashed, and inflation was rampant. The rice harvest plunged from 3.8million <b>tons</b> <b>in</b> 1969 to 493,000 <b>tons</b> <b>in</b> 1973.

5|$|Fisheries {{operating}} off Portugal and Japan {{are responsible}} for most commercial landings of the kitefin shark, generally as bycatch in bottom trawls and on hook-and-line. Portugal reported a kitefin shark bycatch of 282 <b>tons</b> <b>in</b> 2000 and 119 <b>tons</b> <b>in</b> 2003. In {{other areas of the}} northeastern Atlantic this shark is rare and reported catches are likely confounded by misidentifications of other species; some are caught by mixed-species gillnet fisheries operating in deep water west of the British Isles, where surveys suggest that kitefin shark numbers may have declined by 94% since the 1970s. In the Mediterranean, this shark is caught incidentally by bottom trawl and gillnet fisheries. Although it is generally discarded alive, many are unable to return to deep water and do not survive. In the Southern Hemisphere, catches by the Australian South East Trawl Fishery are increasing following the relaxation of regulations regarding seafood mercury content; this species is not included under Australian fishery quotas. New Zealand kitefin shark catches peaked from 1986 to 1997. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the kitefin shark as Near Threatened worldwide, and as Vulnerable in the northeastern Atlantic in light of documented population declines.|$|E

5|$|In 1896, the British Moss Litter Company was formed, from an {{amalgamation}} of the Hatfield Chase Peat Moss Litter Company, the Griendtsveen Moss Litter Company, {{and most}} of the other companies working on the moors. They gained control of works at Creyke's Siding and Moorends to the west, Medge Hall to the south, Swinefleet to the east, and Old Goole in the north, together with the mill on Hatfield Moors. Old Goole mill closed in 1902, although peat was stored there for another twelve years. The new company did not have complete control of the moors, as there were several small independent peat works on Crowle Moor. The company was restructured in 1899, by winding up the original company and creating a new one with the same name but additional working capital. At the same time, Swinefleet Works was formally purchased, whereas it had been leased by the old company.

5|$|Once {{the canals}} were {{owned by the}} London and North Western Railway, {{restrictions}} were imposed on what they could carry, and the canals failed to make sufficient money to cover the interest on mortgages. However, they made a substantial operating profit for some years. Around 1850, the average annual income was £104,638, which yielded a surplus of £45,885. Most of the income was from carrying, and by 1870, income had risen to £143,976, although this only yielded a surplus of £11,727. Total traffic was 855,462 <b>tons</b> <b>in</b> 1858, but this had dropped to 742,315 <b>tons</b> <b>in</b> 1868. The carrying business was expanded in the 1870s, but although turnover increased, operating profits fell dramatically, to just £1,568 in 1876. By 1905, total traffic was 469,950 tons, nearly all of it in boats owned by the company, and between the 1870s and {{the onset of the}} First World War the company sometimes made a small operating profit and sometimes a loss. Following the end of the war, working hours were cut, wages increased, and the cost of materials increased. Losses escalated, to £153,318 on an income of £227,845 in 1920, and carriage by the company ceased in 1921, in an attempt to reduce losses. 433,230 tons of goods carried in 1929 had dropped to 151,144 <b>tons</b> <b>in</b> 1940, by which time income from tolls was £17,763, and total income was £40,985.|$|E

5|$|The {{black dogfish}} is {{harmless}} to humans and of little commercial value. Substantial numbers are caught incidentally by commercial deep-sea trawl, gillnet, and longline fisheries operating throughout the North Atlantic, including the Icelandic Greenland halibut fishery, the French mixed-species trawl fishery, and the Canadian Greenland halibut, crab, redfish, monkfish, and witch fisheries. Captured sharks are usually discarded, though {{in recent years}} this and other small deepwater sharks have been increasingly retained and used for fishmeal. Reported catches by European countries, of which France made the largest contribution, have followed a declining trend from 486 <b>tons</b> <b>in</b> 2001 to 35 <b>tons</b> <b>in</b> 2006. The average catch by Canadian fisheries was 68 tons per year from 1996 to 2005.

5|$|Until recently, Portugal was {{the only}} European country to utilize the Portuguese dogfish. An {{important}} bycatch of the black scabbardfish (Aphanops carbo) longline fishery, between 300 and 900 tons of this shark were landed annually from 1986 to 1999. Its per-weight value has been increasing since 1986, and thus exploitation is likely to continue. Around 1990, French bottom trawlers began to fish for Portuguese dogfish and leafscale gulper sharks (Centrophorus squamosus) west of the British Isles for meat and livers; these two species are together referred to as siki. The siki catch peaked at 3,284 <b>tons</b> <b>in</b> 1996 before declining to 1,939 <b>tons</b> <b>in</b> 1999. The French have since been joined by Norwegian, Irish, and Scottish longliners and trawlers, making the Portuguese dogfish a significant component of deepwater fisheries in the northwest Atlantic. While stocks off Portugal seem to be stable for now, stocks off the British Isles have diminished substantially in recent years; this may reflect the disparity between the less massified Portuguese fishery and the commercial French fishery. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened, because of its commercial value and low reproductive productivity.|$|E
