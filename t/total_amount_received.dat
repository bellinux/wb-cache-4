50|$|Mr. Waters, in a {{pamphlet}} which he published, gives the <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> <b>received</b> by {{her from the}} theatre in 1807, including benefits, at £5,000, and her total profits that year, with concerts, provincial tour, etc., at £16,700,—an immense sum to be received in such a period for {{the services of a}} single artist. That she sometimes found a difficulty in getting payment is not surprising, especially from such a manager as Taylor. Ebers relates that, on one occasion, she refused to sing unless a debt of £1,000 due to her was paid; and that he gave security for this, of which he had ultimately to pay every farthing. She received as much as 200 guineas for singing 'God save the King' and 'Rule Britannia,' and at a single festival £2,000. Had she practised the least economy she must have amassed a very great fortune; but this she did not do. It is said, for example, that the consumption of beer by her servants during a single year amounted to £103. More serious causes, however, contributed to dissipate these riches as fast as she gained them; for her husband was passionately addicted to gambling, and lost vast sums at play. She remained seven years in England, where she finally succeeded in becoming the only singer of eminence, and led in both lines; but one singer does not constitute an opera, though Valabrègue used to say 'Ma femme et quatre ou cinq poupées,—voilà tout ce qu'il faut.' Neither would her disposition endure the possibility of rivalry, nor the extravagance of her increasing demands allow any manager to engage other singers.|$|E

30|$|To fund it, he favoured taxing inheritance, and {{it seems}} {{important}} today to reconsider the role of inheritance taxation. Historically, the taxation of wealth transfers was {{an important source of}} tax revenues. In the United Kingdom, in the 1930 s, a higher proportion of the population were taxed on their estates at death than typically paid income tax on their incomes in any one year. The role of inheritance declined over the twentieth century, but there are signs that it is returning in importance. In France, we have seen a significant rise in the amount of wealth passing from one generation to another, with a particular role played by gifts inter vivos (Piketty 2011). This evidence of the return of inheritance points to the re-establishment of effective taxation on lifetime wealth transfers received, based on the (indexed) <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> <b>received</b> in bequests and gifts over the lifetime. Calling it a lifetime capital receipts tax, rather than a transfer tax, would emphasise the aspect at which the tax is directed – the transmission of unearned advantage.|$|E

40|$|An {{individual}} {{should be}} indifferent between a rebate subsidy of rate sr and a matching subsidy of rate sm = sr/(1 - sr), and the <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> <b>received</b> by the charity {{should be the}} same regardless of subsidy type. Recent laboratory and field experiments contradict these straightforward predictions of standard economic theory: subjects consistently make decisions that result in larger amounts going to the charity under a matching subsidy than under an equivalent rebate subsidy. This paper tests whether this result is due to rebate-aversion – a preference by donors for a match over a rebate subsidy. Consistent with theory we find no significant preference for one or the other subsidy scheme.

We find that 66 % of the investees send false messages with both under and over, statement being observed. Investors are naive and almost half of them believe the message received. We find greater lying when the distribution of the multiplier is unknown by the investors than when they know the distribution. Further, messages make beliefs about the multiplier more pessimistic when the investors know the distribution of the multiplier, while the opposite is true when they do not know the distribution...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{has attempted}} to investigate the involvement of women in rural areas ofthe Mbashe local municipality. This was investigated {{to find out if}} the government foodse curity programs in rural areas have been designed to address the issue of women empowerment in irrigated farming, how involved women are in terms of farm decision making and management. A structured questionnaire was used to collect information on demographic parameters, Irrigation and water use information, production information and market and marketing information. A total of 69 structured questionnaires were administered to identify gender roles in irrigated farming with special emphasis to the roles played by women in farm decision making and management in Ngxakaxha Administrative Area of Mbashe local municipality of the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Own food production has been found to be the main food acquisition strategy in rural areas; people involved in it farm for their own consumption and then sell the remaining produce. About 80 % of the farmers practise irrigated agriculture with or without the use of a formal irrigation system provided and managed by government departments. Descriptive statistics were generated using the Statistical Package for Social sciences (SPSS). Subsequently, the data were subjected to inferential analysis using the binomial logistic regression model. The perceptions influencing the predictor variable were defined and tested using the binomial logistic regression model. The statistically significant independent variables, at the level 5 % significant level are as follows; area and the number of years in farming. At the 10 % significant level; the total number of bags sold and the <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> <b>received</b> (revenue). Basically the area is negatively correlated with irrigation and own production in rural areas. The household head is the one that determines household own production. The number of years involvement in farming determine their experience in farming and the amount of yield he / she will get. Major constraints to sustainable irrigation, as revealed by the analysis, were lack of funding for the projects in terms of an rrigation system, lack of a source of water, lack of new information and workshops. Women were found to be fully involved in irrigated farming nowadays, but training is needed for both men and women in rural areas for their production and irrigation to be sustainable over time. It has been concluded that there are programmes which have been designed and are driven by the women and a number of these programmes are also addressing the issues of gender equality in rural areas...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study, which {{pertains}} to the public stockyards market located at Omaha and the marketing of hogs produced in Nebraska is: first, to determine the supply area of this market {{in relationship to the}} production of hogs in this state; second, to determine the cost of transportation and marketing; third, to show the relationship of transportation and marketing costs to the price of hogs; fourth, to show the trend in transportation and terminal market costs and the volume of shipments by rail, commercial truck, and “other” or farmer owned truck. The data used in this study were obtained from the John Clay Livestock Commission Company and the Farmers Union Livestock Commission Company of South Omaha, Nebraska. The Information obtained from the John Clay Livestock Commission Company pertained to transactions occurring on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday of each week for the years 1930 to 1935 inclusive. The Farmers Union Livestock Commission Company handles a larger volume of livestock and {{in order to reduce the}} size of the sample transactions occurring on Tuesday and Wednesday were recorded. Uniform charges are made for the services of the Union Stock Yards Company and the various livestock commission companies so there was no need to obtain a representative sample for each commission company for the purpose of making a comparison of services or costs. It was of greater importance to secure a sample representative of all sections of the supply area of this market. Records were obtained on 235, 547 head of hogs consigned from various counties in Nebraska to the Omaha Market. The number of sales was not determined but each record represented on consignment and included the following information: date, point of origin, number of head, total weight, <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> <b>received,</b> each item of expense, and the total expenses. In some instances supplementary information has been obtained from the U. S. Census, Nebraska Agricultural Statistics, and other publications. Although this study covers sales of livestock for every week for a six year period there are definite limitations to the uses that can be made of some of the data. No more than 3 per cent of the total movement of hogs from Nebraska to Omaha was included in the sample for any one year. A larger sample would provide better information on average weights and prices for counties contributing relatively few hogs to this market. Also, weights and prices vary over a wide range and a large number of records is required if reliable results are to be obtained. Advisor: L. F. Gare...|$|E
