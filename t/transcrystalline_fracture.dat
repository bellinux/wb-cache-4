(Tensile tests were carried out at strain rate of 2. 5 × 10 − 4 s− 1.) The evaluated mechanical properties show that ECAP has the highest effect on formability and mechanical properties of the aluminium alloy EN AW 2014. Severe plastic deformation by means of ECAP causes rapid increase of strength and only partial decrease of ductility was achieved.

The sintering temperature, main crystal phase, microstructure and fracture mode of the composites synthetized by sintering are different with change of ratio of Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 and content of Al 2 O 3 : (1) If the ratio of Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 and content of Al 2 O 3 is low, sintering temperature of the composites is high, the main crystal phase is mullite, microstructure shows interlocking network structure formed by columnar mullite, the fracture mode of composites shows that mullite appears in the pulled out state; (2) If the ratio of Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 content of Al 2 O 3 is high, sintering temperature of the composites is low, the main crystal phase is corundum, microstructure shows the skeleton structure formed by granulous corundumthe, the fracture mode of composites shows intergranular fracture formed by corundum, occasionally <b>transcrystalline</b> <b>fracture.</b> The major reason of different sintering temperature of the composites is concerned with mullitization degree and content of glass phase...|$|E

40|$|In the {{presented}} {{work the}} change in fracture for the Al- 12 Al 4 C 3 system was investigated and analysed at temperatures from 20 to 400 °C and strain rates from 2. 5 · 10 – 5 to 10 – 1 s– 1. At room temperature 20 °C, during tensile testing at strain rates in the tested region, the strain is first controlled by work hardening, expressed by the exponent n. In the second generally smaller part the deformation is limited by local straining and forming the neck. There is a marked decrease of plastic properties for the strain rate ε & = 2. 5 · 10 – 5 s– 1 {{with the growth of}} temperature in the investigated region. It is explained by changes in the micromechanism of deformation and fracture. Fracture surface shows the transition from ductile fracture with dimples at 20 °C, to intercrystalline fractures, with the growth of the temperature, an indication of exhausted grain boundary plasticity. The intercrystalline fracture initiation tends, it is supposed, to be localized in triple points. At temperatures 400 °C, and ε & = 10 – 1 s– 1 there is a marked growth of plastic properties. The first part of the strain characterized by work hardening is very short. After the short growth of the stress to maximum, a deformation mechanism, showing presence of thermally and mechanically activated dynamic recovery processes takes place.

40|$|Solid bitumen and oil {{inclusions}} in the Mesoproterozoic Roper Group of the Roper Superbasin indicate extensive {{oil migration}} during the Mesoproterozoic. Although most samples contain abundant bitumen, {{but very few}} oil-bearing fluid inclusions, one sample of the Bessie Creek Sandstone and one sample of a dolerite sill were found to contain sufficient oil-bearing fluid inclusions to warrant detailed microthermometric and molecular compositional analyses. In the Bessie Creek Sandstone, the oil inclusions are located within extensive transgranular fractures, which cut pervasive quartz overgrowths and a contact metamorphic fabric caused by the ca 1280 Ma intrusion event. Consequently, oil migration is interpreted {{to have taken place}} when the sandstone was well cemented, following extensive diagenesis and dolerite emplacement. Microthermometry of coeval oil and brine inclusions indicates 60 ± 5 °C as the minimum temperature of entrapment. Oil-bearing fluid inclusions in the dolerite sill occur as dense clusters within albitised zones of labradorite crystals and in <b>transcrystalline</b> <b>fractures</b> cutting vein calcite and rarely vein quartz. Microthermometry of coeval oil-bearing and aqueous fluid inclusions, combined with textural evidence, indicates that the oil was trapped at about 110 °C, after the dolerite had cooled significantly towards ambient diagenetic temperatures. Because the location, association, petrography and microthermometric behaviour of these inclusions are strikingly similar to those described for the underlying Bessie Creek Sandstone, they are interpreted to represent the same oil migration event. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of the inclusion oils reveals non-biodegraded oils, which are very mature in the Bessie Creek Sandstone and are an apparently pre-trapping mixture of a high-maturity gas-condensate and a lower-maturity oil in the dolerite sill. Biomarkers (mainly hopanes, monomethylalkanes, alkylcyclohexanes and traces of steranes) suggest a source rock dominated by prokaryotic cyanobacterial organic matter, with a small contribution from eukaryotes {{in the case of the}} dolerite sill oil. Based on its organic richness and proximity, the most likely source for the oils is the organic-rich marine Velkerri Formation, deposited at ca 1430 Ma, with a possible component in the mixed oil from the slightly older ca 1600 Ma Barney Creek Formation of the underlying McArthur Group. Although we cannot fully rule out the possibility of migration while the group was buried beneath Palaeozoic cover, the most likely timing of migration is interpreted to be before significant uplift, during structural inversion between 1300 – 1000 Ma. The case studies illustrate how oil inclusions can provide unique and often pristine compositional data on extant hydrocarbon fluids, the relative timing of their entrapment and the conditions under which they were trapped. 23 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Butt welds of {{friction}} stir welded dissimilar titanium alloys (near α: Ti- 6242 standard grain (SG) and α + β; Ti- 54 M) were produced for varying processing parameters (rotation speed: rpm and traverse speed; mm·min− 1). Microstructures, microhardness, and fractured surfaces were analyzed for three different rpms and mm·min− 1 with Ti- 6242 SG and Ti- 54 M {{kept on the}} advancing and retreating side, respectively. While constant traverse speed (varying rotation speed) has no significant effect on micrographic patterns in weld nugget, constant rotation speed (with increasing traverse speed) results in {{an increasing number of}} streaks with specified spacing (advances per revolution) (consisting of material migrating from retreating side) on the advancing side. Although, hardness variation within streaks (due to lower values of v ω; where v   and   ω are traverse and rotation speed) were challenging to evaluate, yet hardness maps imitated the micrographic morphology of the weld nugget. For varying rotation (225 – 325 rpm) and traverse speed (100 – 150 mm·min− 1), corresponding microstructure evolutions on the advancing and retreating side were related, with variations in evolving temperatures for corresponding welding parameters. Fractured surfaces revealed an appearance of a combination of <b>transcrystalline</b> and intercrystalline <b>fracture</b> for all the processing parameters.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 08 In {{the world}} of joining, {{riveting}} and additive manufacturing, weight reduction, and omission of defects (at both macro and micro level) remain of paramount. Therefore, {{in the wake of}} ubiquitous fusion welding (FW) and widely accepted approach of riveting using Inconel bolts to resist corrosion at higher temperature, friction stir welding (FSW) has emerged as a novice jewel in friction based additive manufacturing industry. With advancements in automation of welding process and tool material, FSW of materials with higher work hardening such as steel and titanium has also become probable. Process and property relations associated with FSW are inevitable in case of dissimilar titanium alloys, due to presence of heterogeneity (whether atrocious or advantageous) in and around the weld nugget. These process property relationships are needed to be studied and addressed properly in order to optimize the processing window for improved mechanical and metallurgical properties. In this study FSWed similar and dissimilar butt joints of α+β, and near α titanium, alloys have been produced for varying processing conditions in order to study the effect of rotation speed (rpm) and traverse speed (TS; mm-min- 1). The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the effect of tool geometry, tool rpm, TS on microstructure and mechanical properties of most widely used α+β titanium alloy, Ti- 6 Al- 4 V (Ti- 64), standard grain and fine grain in addition to α+β,Ti- 5 Al- 4 V (T- 54 M), standard grain, and near α, Ti- 6 Al- 2 Mo- 4 Zr- 2 Sn (Ti- 6242), standard grain (SG) and fine grain (FG). During FSW, a unique α+β fine-grained microstructure has been formed depending on whether or not the peak temperature in the weld nugget (WN) reached above or below β transus temperature. The resulting microstructure consists of acicular α+β, emanating from the prior β grain boundary as the weld cools off. The changes in the microstructure are observed by optical microscopy (OM). Later, a detailed analysis of material flow has been done by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Hardness profiles on the transverse cross section of the weld have been measured in order to relate the deformation of main constituents, α {hexagonal close packed (hcp) }, and β {body centered cubic (bcc) } that provides a new paradigm into grain refinement mechanism. Material flow and evolving microstructure along with distribution of corresponding elements distribution was characterized by SEM, and EDS respectively. For the case of dissimilar alloys (Ti- 6242 & Ti- 54 M, and Ti- 6242 & Ti- 64) a necklace shaped macrostructure has been observed in the WN consisting of untransformed α migrating from the side of Ti- 6242, and of basket-weave morphology (prior β grains transforming into α+β decorated with grain boundary α) of Ti- 54 M. Microhardness characterization undoubtedly reveals distinct boundaries between weld nugget and parent material. However, to understand the constitutive behavior of the thermo mechanically affected zone (TMAZ) on the advancing side (ADV), or retreating side (RET) and of WN, digital image correlation (DIC) technique has been adapted to develop strain maps in transverse tensile specimens. Improved mechanical properties of TMAZ on the ADV in comparison with RET TMAZ are in accordance with hardness values. Occurrence of fracture on the RET side, and morphology of the fractured surface have also been discussed. Based on the fractured morphology, it can be said that the presence of distinct and clustered island like morphologies in the form of <b>transcrystalline</b> and intercrystalline <b>fracture</b> is a results of microstructure that evolves due to difference in β transus temperature of two alloys. The mechanical properties are analyzed and discussed in that regard. Evolving volume fraction of phases along with their crystallographic orientation has also been elucidated. Evolution of texture has been discussed in terms of (100) _α,(002) _α,(110) _β,(101) _α and (102) _α. Main constituents of texture in friction stir welded dissimilar titanium alloys, (101) _α and (002) _α have been discussed for their strength and orientation at various rotation speed. It has been highlighted that for the FSW of dissimilar titanium alloys (near α,and α+β), center of the WN is stronger in texture in comparison with RET and ADV side. Furthermore, state-of-the-art FSW technique has been used to weld dissimilar titanium alloys for post weld heat treatment (PWHT) studies at 933 °C for 45 minutes. The processing parameters for welding are 225 rpm, and 125 mm-min- 1. In light of recent PWHT, conducted for FSWed Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, in order to achieve super plasticity, our study focuses on dissimilar titanium alloys, Ti- 54 M, and Ti- 6242 FG. A proper understanding of underlying material flow during FSW of dissimilar titanium alloys is essential in designing a monolithic structure operating under varying thermal and mechanical loading. Higher fraction of α with no pre-defined prior β grain boundaries has been observed in PWHTed condition. Uniform, rather lower values of hardness have been achieved in the PWHTed specimen. Furthermore, Spatial arrangement, whether on ADV or RET, can significantly affect the evolution of microstructure, and congruent mechanical properties. In this study, Ti- 54 M and Ti- 6242 FG have been joined by FSW with Ti- 6242 FG being on ADV side. X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique has been utilized for phase evaluation, pole figure analysis, and residual stress measurements. Finally, a wide range of weld surfaces, macrostructures, microstructures, microhardness profiles, phase evolution, pole figures, full field strain maps, material flow patterns, fractographs and development of residual stresses has been presented in corresponding appendices. The morphology of the fractured surfaces along with the residual stress distribution, rendered by different rpm and TS employed on different combination of similar and dissimilar joints of titanium alloys, provided an insight to correlate the material flow, hardness distributions, tensile properties; yield strength (YS), ultimate tensile strength (UTS), and percentage elongation (% Elong.) ...|$|R
