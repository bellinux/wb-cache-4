5|$|Although McKinley enjoyed {{meeting the}} public, Cortelyou was {{concerned}} with his security due to recent assassinations by anarchists in Europe, such as the assassination of King Umberto I of Italy the previous year, and twice tried to remove a public reception from the President's rescheduled visit to the Exposition. McKinley refused, and Cortelyou arranged for additional security for the <b>trip.</b> <b>On</b> September 5, the President delivered his address at the fairgrounds, before a crowd of some 50,000 people. In his final speech, McKinley urged reciprocity treaties with other nations to assure American manufacturers access to foreign markets. He intended the speech as a keynote to his plans for a second term.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Department of Recreational Sports, the BGSU Outdoor Program offers outdoor trips, {{an indoor}} {{climbing}} wall, team-building, and an outdoor equipment rental center to BGSU students, faculty, staff and surrounding community members. In August 2008 the program introduced the Freshman Wilderness Experience, which couples a week-long backpacking <b>trip</b> <b>on</b> the Appalachian Trail with a monthly class to assist students in transitioning {{from high school to}} college life. In 2009 The Outdoor Program won the David J Web Award by the Association of Outdoor Recreation and Education (AORE) as an outstanding non-profit outdoor program.|$|E
5|$|Beginning at Main Street, U.S.A. Station {{adjacent}} to the Magic Kingdom park's entrance, the trains of the Walt Disney World Railroad travel along its single track in a clockwise direction on its circular route. It takes about 20 minutes for each train to complete a round <b>trip</b> <b>on</b> the WDWRR's main line, and on any given day, either two or three trains run, with two running on a typical day. Each train is operated by an engineer and fireman in the locomotive, {{as well as a}} conductor {{at the rear of the}} train who supervises the passengers.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the newly formed Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) began subsidizing northside {{commuter}} rail operations in the late 1960s, both the Lexington Branch and the Central Mass Branch {{had been reduced to}} single rush hour round trips on poorly maintained track. The South Sudbury run on the Central Mass was terminated on November 26, 1971. The Bedford round <b>trip</b> <b>on</b> the Lexington Branch ended after a major snowstorm on January 10, 1977, leaving the Fitchburg Line (with multiple daily round trips) as the only rail service at Cambridge station.|$|E
5|$|During {{his stay}} in France, Day {{regularly}} corresponded with Edgeworth. He said that both girls were passionate about their studies, Sabrina more so. Day also related anecdotes, one concerning a <b>trip</b> <b>on</b> the Rhone where the boat overturned and he rescued both girls single-handedly as neither could swim. He described {{an incident in}} which he challenged a French Army officer to a duel, even producing a set of dueling pistols, simply as a manner of engaging or encouraging conversation with his young students; the officer apologised and explained he did not mean any offence, calming the situation.|$|E
5|$|No part of M-134 {{is listed}} on the National Highway System, a system of roadways {{important}} to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. In 2009, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) conducted a survey to determine the traffic volume along the highway, reported using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). The department determined that the highest count was the 3,595vehicles a day that used the highway west of the M-129 junction in Cedarville; the lowest counts were 608vehicles daily between the M-48 junction and the De Tour village limits. On the island, 667vehicles use M-134 daily. According to tourism officials in the area, over 100,000vehicles per year are transported round <b>trip</b> <b>on</b> the ferry with almost twice as many additional passengers.|$|E

5|$|Roland Morris was an {{experienced}} instructor {{with more than}} 2,000 hours. He was critical of Finucane's habit of trying to force the aircraft {{to do what he}} wanted instead of coaxing it. Despite a series of blunders, Finucane wanted to fly solo. At that time Finucane was five hours flight training behind the rest of his group, but he made a successful solo <b>trip</b> <b>on</b> 21 September after the completion of 14:05 hours piloting. The flight was not without fault; Finucane nearly stalled the aircraft after taking off.|$|E

5|$|She was not {{the first}} woman balloonist. On 20 May 1784, the Marchioness and Countess of Montalembert, the Countess of Podenas and a Miss de Lagarde had taken a <b>trip</b> <b>on</b> a {{tethered}} balloon in Paris. Neither was she the first woman to ascend in an untethered balloon: in Blanchard's time, Citoyenne Henri, who had made an ascent with André-Jacques Garnerin in 1798, was widely credited with that ballooning first, although the honour actually belonged to Elizabeth Thible. Thible, an opera singer, had made an ascent to entertain Gustav III of Sweden in Lyon on 4 June 1784, fourteen years before Citoyenne Henri. Blanchard was, however, the first woman to pilot her own balloon and the first to adopt ballooning as a career.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} a larger ferry on the Skarnsund service was also pressing. Cars often had to wait, and if the ferry sailed with full capacity, {{there was no room}} for {{passengers}} to leave their vehicles. Work to procure a new ferry to replace Skarnsund started in 1981. This resulted in the acquisition of the second-hand ferry Mosvik from Bergen, with a capacity of 24 cars, which entered service starting 9 December 1982. Skarnsund was leased to Namsos Trafikkselskap. In 1982, tickets for a single <b>trip</b> <b>on</b> the Skarnsund Ferry were NOK5 for an adult and NOK14 for a car with driver. On the Ytterøy service, it was NOK7 and 25, respectively. Discounts were available, up to 33% for cars and 50% for trucks and buses.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks after}} taking over service, Amtrak added the Boston-New Haven Bay State, which {{restored}} {{service on the}} B as far west as Springfield. Never successful, it was ended on March 1, 1975. The MBTA began subsidizing Penn Central commuter rail service between Boston and Framingham – but not the lone commuter trip to Worcester – in January 1973. Penn Central discontinued the Worcester <b>trip</b> <b>on</b> October 27, 1975; in response, Amtrak revived the dormant New York-Chicago Lake Shore Limited on October 31, with a new section running Boston-Albany and thus restoring service to Pittsfield. The Lake Shore Limited stopped at the east-of-downtown station {{that had been used}} from 1965 to 1971.|$|E

While tokens {{have been used in}} the past, at present, riders use contactless cards called SUBE, which are rechargeable with multiple forms of payment. Previously, single or multi-use paper cards with a magnetic strip (called Subtepass) were used, however, these were phased out of the system in May 2016, opting instead only to use the digital cards, with the exception of some retired, disabled and student cards. Trains run from 05:00 until 23:00, every 3–4minutes, for all lines except Line H which has a frequency of around 6minutes. Under modernisation plans commenced in 2013, service frequencies are set to increase to an average of one train every 2:20 by 2019.|$|E
5|$|However, it {{was soon}} {{revealed}} that the cannon had been appropriated by MIT {{in retaliation for the}} previous year's pranks, and relocated to Cambridge. The MIT team consisted of about 30 hackers, of which two flew to Pasadena and five drove cross-country. While acquiring the cannon disguised as construction contractors, the hackers had run-ins with a Caltech security guard and physical plant worker, to whom they explained that they were moving the cannon in preparation for the pouring of a concrete pedestal. Once off Caltech's campus, a local resident called in a noise complaint, and the Pasadena police arrived but did not recognize the then-disguised cannon. On the way to the shipping company, the trailer's hitch cracked, necessitating a slow <b>trip</b> <b>on</b> surface roads, and on arrival they were unable to physically remove the cannon from the trailer, causing them to spend an extra $1000 for the services of a company that specialized in moving large film props.|$|E
