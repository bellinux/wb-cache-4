50|$|The {{dual system}} did cause some problems. Failure <b>to</b> <b>retract</b> <b>the</b> shoes when {{entering}} France caused severe damage to trackside equipment, leading to SNCF installing {{a pair of}} concrete blocks at the Calais end of both tunnels to break off the third rail shoes {{if they had not}} been retracted.

50|$|The {{bolt handle}} {{on the right side}} is engaged only when the large, round knob is pushed in, and {{functions}} only <b>to</b> <b>retract</b> <b>the</b> bolt.

50|$|The left {{engine failure}} coincided with <b>the</b> co-pilot’s request <b>to</b> <b>retract</b> <b>the</b> landing gear and {{disrupted}} that action. <b>The</b> co-pilot mentioned <b>retracting</b> <b>the</b> gear again but, at that moment, the task-sharing had been reversed.
