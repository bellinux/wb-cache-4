Indeed, he ran the full gauntlet of emotions that all footballers run, but always retained a level head on the pitch, never losing his temper or allowing his emotions to affect his game.|$|E

It doesn’t breathe. So Brian was basically encased in a sixty-pound wet-suit. Every part of his body was covered. He had facial prosthetics, hands, full legs, feet. It was all glued down. It wasn’t like we could <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> between takes. He was in.|$|E
5|$|Susan meets Jim Dolan at the {{hospital}} and she asks him to talk about the Patient Advocacy Program for a news article. Jim reveals that he has cancer and Susan supports him during his treatments. Malcolm comes to visit his parents and detects all is not well between them. Susan becomes worried when Jim does not answer her calls and Karl confesses that he asked Jim to keep his distance, which angers Susan. She accuses Karl of being jealous. Karl invites Jim over for lunch and he notices the map and leaflets for Peru. Jim works out Susan is delaying the holiday for him. He then collapses and Susan begs Karl to save him. Susan comforts Jim when he realises he is going to die and she tries to <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of {{the hospital}}, so they can visit his childhood home, as promised. Karl stops her and when they step outside to talk, Jim dies. Susan is devastated and blames Karl for keeping her from Jim. She then leaves to arrange Jim's funeral.

Over 300 Municipal officers were stationed at City Hall, and Walling was stopped and thrown out into the street. He attempted several times to re-enter, arguing with Captain Abraham Ackerman, until the arrival of Captains Jacob Sebring and Coroner Perry, leading fifty Metropolitans, to serve the second warrant.|$|E

25|$|The {{other basic}} {{defensive}} play {{is called the}} bump or ride-off. It's similar to a body check in hockey. In a ride-off, a player rides his pony alongside an opponent's mount {{in order to move}} an opponent away from the ball or to <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of a play. It must be executed properly so that it does not endanger the horses or the players. The angle of contact must be safe and can not knock the horses off balance, or harm the horses in any way. Two players following the line of the ball and riding one another off have the right of way over a single man coming from any direction.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, Kirsten played flyhalf for Western Province under-20 in {{a curtain}} raiser {{to the first}} test between the Springboks and the British and Irish Lions at Newlands Stadium in Cape Town. In wet {{conditions}} his ball handling abilities so impressed journalist John Reason, that special mention of this was made in his book, The Unbeaten Lions. Kirsten, aged 19, was selected {{to play for the}} Quaggas against the touring Lions. He scored 12 points as his team was defeated by 16 – 20. Following the Lions-Quagga game, he was duly selected to play for the Western Province rugby team, but in only his third match, he severely damaged his knee. It would <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of rugby permanently.|$|E
25|$|The {{kidnapping}} problems, however, {{have been}} replaced with violence related to the drug trade, {{despite the fact that}} Morelos is far from the U.S. border. The 2009 slaying of kingpin Arturo Beltrán Leyva set of a turf war for his successor. It has increased the number of gun battles and gangland-style executions. Anonymous email threats succeed in keeping people away from Cuernavaca at night, with bars and nightclubs closing when such communications threaten drug violence. In 2004, Governor Sergio Estrada ordered the mass firing of all of the state police officers after top police commanders were arrested on charges that they were working with drug traffickers. This caused a major political battle for the governor, who then himself was accused of coperating with drug rings, with attempts to <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of office. The area around Lagunas de Zempoala National Park, on Morelos's border with Mexico City, is one of Mexico's 16 most dangerous regions, in part due to the narcotics trade.|$|E

25|$|On June 2, 1915, Bob Ashley {{attempted}} {{to break his}} brother John out of jail. Entering the jailer's house, Bob Ashley shot Deputy Sheriff Wilber W. Hendrickson at point-blank range and left with his jail keys. He then ran from {{the house to the}} garage where gang members had left him a getaway car. When he found he was unable to drive the particular car left for him, he {{attempted to}} force several men at gunpoint to drive the car for him. Each of the men claimed to not know how to drive the car either so Bob Ashley jumped on the running board of a passing truck and forced the driver, T.H. Duckett, to <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of town. A deputy, officer J.R. Riblet, spotted Ashley and gave chase. When the truck suddenly stalled {{in the middle of the}} street, a shootout occurred resulting in the deaths of both Bob Ashley and Riblet. Angered by Bob's killing spree, several thousand Miami residents threatened the jailhouse and talked of lynching John Ashley in his cell. It was only after police paraded the body of Bob Ashley though the streets that the mob dispersed.|$|E
25|$|Six {{days after}} North Carolina avenged their earlier loss at Duke in February with a 90-83 {{victory at the}} Dean Dome, the two teams would face off in the semifinals of the ACC Tournament, this time in Brooklyn, New York in the Barclays Center. This game was only the fifth time that Duke and North Carolina had played each other outside {{of the state of}} North Carolina. North Carolina {{controlled}} the first half by outscoring Duke in the paint 32-10, with North Carolina's Kennedy Meeks leading the charge. North Carolina led by as many as 13 points and threatened to turn the game into a blowout, but Duke's Grayson Allen made four 3-pointers to get Duke within 7 points at the half, with North Carolina leading 49-42. In the second half, with North Carolina leading Duke 56-48 with 15:04 left, North Carolina's Joel Berry II picked up his fourth foul, which forced North Carolina to <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of the game. Though North Carolina led by 13 points at 61-48 with 13:53 remaining, Duke used a 20-4 run over the next five minutes, thanks to steals and three-pointers from Duke's Jayson Tatum and Luke Kennard, to put Duke up 68-65 over North Carolina with 8:24 left. Duke then pulled away and won 93-83 to complete a 45-22 run over North Carolina in the final 14 minutes of the game.|$|E
25|$|The last {{murder to}} involve Gravano was {{the murder of}} Louie DiBono, the made man Gravano had {{threatened}} to kill earlier. Gravano described {{the reasons for the}} murder in Underboss: He was still robbing the family and I asked for permission to <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>out.</b> But John had a meeting with DiBono, and DiBono told John that he had a billion dollars of drywall work that was coming out of the World Trade Center. John bit, hook, line and sinker, and refused my request. John said he would handle DiBono personally and become his partner. But DiBono was up to his old tricks double-dealing. He had obviously been bullshitting John. So when John called Louie in for meetings to discuss their new partnership, DiBono didn't show up. John was humiliated. This meant an automatic death penalty. John gave the contract to DiBono's captain, Pat Conte. Conte botched an ideal opportunity to kill DiBono. Then, as Gotti grew increasingly impatient, Conte explained that the problem now was trying to corner DiBono again. Whenever a meeting with him was arranged, DiBono never appeared. It was a joke, what was going on. I couldn't help laughing to myself. I told John why didn't Pat simplify everything. Just call Louie up and tell him to hang himself. Ten months went by. John looks like an asshole. He was too embarrassed even to ask me for help.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, Harvick {{would spend}} the season concentrating on running the Cup Series and would only start four races in the Busch Series. He would only have one Top 10 in those four starts. Harvick began the 2002 season making his first Daytona 500 {{starting}} on the outside pole next to Jimmie Johnson, but his day ended after triggering an 18-car crash on lap 148, allowing him to finish 36th. Later in the season, he made a fine for a post-race incident with Greg Biffle at Bristol Motor Speedway. He was suspended for rough driving in a Truck race at Martinsville, in which he intentionally spun out driver Coy Gibbs, allowing NASCAR to immediately <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of the race. Even though it was {{heard on the radio}} that he actually did, Harvick lied in a post-race interview saying that he didn't purposely wreck Gibbs. Harvick was banned from the Cup Series race the next day, which meant that Kenny Wallace would replace him. Harvick scored his first career Winston Cup pole position in the Pepsi 400 at Daytona. Later in the season, he scored his third Winston Cup Victory at Chicagoland Speedway. He finished 21st in the 2002 points standings with one win, one pole, five Top 5's and eight Top 10's. Harvick became the 2002 IROC Champion in his first season in the Series, winning at California Speedway. In Trucks, Harvick began fielding his own No. 6 truck, driving himself in five races and winning at Phoenix.|$|E
25|$|In 'Nick', Matty is re-enlisted at Roundview, but his {{relationship}} with Liv causes a new love triangle to form—between him, Liv and Franky. Having lost both Mini and Liv, and now living in Matty's shadow, Nick has a nervous breakdown and smashes up his house with a golf club. Through Matty, however, Nick comes to see his father Leon (Dorian Lough) and his parenting in a more negative light and the two brothers take a stand. In his episode, Alo's parents <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of sixth form {{to work on the}} farm, and after he causes an explosion they sell all of his belongings. In protest, he throws a massive party and when he confronts his parents, his father suffers a heart attack. Rather than burden his friend Rich, who has just proudly had sex {{for the first time with}} Grace, he goes home and attempts to repair things with his parents. In 'Grace', Grace introduces Rich to her parents; Rich is shocked to discover that her father is headmaster David Blood (Addison). Blood schemes to have Grace's grades slip on her drama assessment, a staging of 'Twelfth Night', so that he can justify removing her from Roundview. Grace sees her dilemma, as peacemaker, through 'Hamlet's sea of troubles soliloquy; she uses 'Twelfth Night' to bring the love triangle between Matty, Liv and Franky to a head, and ultimately receives an A. After Blood still forces Grace to change schools, Rich is inspired by 'Romeo and Juliet' and proposes to her. In the series finale, the two attempt to marry in secret with the gang as witnesses, though Alo's van breaks down. Mini begins to recognise her attraction to Franky, and becomes very protective of her. After an attempt at sex with Matty, Franky has a panic attack, charges through a forest, and accidentally falls over a ledge. After being rescued by Mini, Matty and Liv, Franky reveals more to her friends about her insecurities. Though Blood intervenes and Grace and Rich do not marry, they are happily allowed to continue dating and the gang, solidified as friends, party together at a local fête.|$|E

The Celtics broke a league record by winning 52 games, and Russell's strong performance once again helped lead the Celtics through the post-season, as {{they returned to the}} NBA Finals. In the 1959 NBA Finals, the Celtics recaptured the NBA title, sweeping the Minneapolis Lakers 4–0. Lakers head coach John Kundla praised Russell, stating, [...] "We don't fear the Celtics without Bill Russell. <b>Take</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> and we can beat them...

At dawn on 19 April 1996, Martin was hanged in Changi Prison together with two Singaporean drug traffickers. On that day, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Royal Thai Police closed their files on the murders of Sheila and Darin Damude, declaring the case effectively solved.|$|E

She said later: [...] "I prayed all night long for my master till the first of March; and all the time he was bringing people to look at me, and trying to sell me." [...] When it appeared as though a sale was being concluded, [...] "I changed my prayer," [...] she said.
