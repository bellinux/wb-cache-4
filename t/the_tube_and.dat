5|$|Indium(III) oxide and indium {{tin oxide}} (ITO) are used as a {{transparent}} conductive coating on glass substrates in electroluminescent panels. Indium tin oxide {{is used as a}} light filter in low-pressure sodium-vapor lamps. The infrared radiation is reflected back into the lamp, which increases the temperature within <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> improves the performance of the lamp.|$|E
5|$|The {{lower than}} {{expected}} passenger numbers were {{partly due to}} competition between <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> sub-surface railway companies, but the introduction of electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, took {{a large number of}} passengers away from the trains. The problem was not limited to the UERL; all of London's seven tube lines and the sub-surface DR and Metropolitan Railway were affected to some degree. The reduced revenues generated from the lower passenger numbers made it difficult for the UERL and the other railways to pay back the capital borrowed, or to pay dividends to shareholders.|$|E
5|$|When the rarefication wave {{reaches the}} other (open) {{end of the}} tube, air rushes in to fill the slight vacuum. A {{little more than a}} 'neutral' amount of air enters <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> causes a {{compression}} wave to travel back up the tube (image 4). Once the compression wave reaches the mouthpiece end of the 'tube', it is reflected again back down the pipe. However at this time, either because the compression wave 'bumped' the reed or because of the natural vibration cycle of the reed, the gap opens and another 'puff' of air is sent down the pipe.|$|E

50|$|A {{tube ice}} {{generator}} is an ice generator {{in which the}} water is frozen in tubes that are extended vertically within a surrounding casing—the freezing chamber. At {{the bottom of the}} freezing chamber there is a distributor plate having apertures surrounding <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> <b>and</b> attached to <b>the</b> separate chamber into which a warm gas is passed to heat <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> <b>and</b> cause <b>the</b> ice rods to slide down.|$|R
5|$|Synthetic gem-quality diamond {{crystals}} {{were first}} produced in 1970 by GE, then reported in 1971. The first successes used a pyrophyllite tube seeded {{at each end}} with thin pieces of diamond. The graphite feed material {{was placed in the}} center and the metal solvent (nickel) between the graphite and the seeds. The container was heated and the pressure was raised to about 5.5GPa. The crystals grow as they flow from the center to the ends of <b>the</b> <b>tube,</b> <b>and</b> extending the length of the process produces larger crystals. Initially, a week-long growth process produced gem-quality stones of around 5mm (1 carat or 0.2 g), and the process conditions had to be as stable as possible. The graphite feed was soon replaced by diamond grit because that allowed much better control of the shape of the final crystal.|$|E
5|$|The {{bottom end}} {{of the body is}} an ampulla (a flask-like swelling), which anchors the animal in <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> enables it to retract its body very quickly when threatened. When the lophophore is {{extended}} {{at the top of the}} body, cilia (little hairs) on the sides of the tentacles draw food particles to the mouth, which is inside and slightly to one side of the base of the lophophore. Unwanted material can be excluded by closing a lid above the mouth or be rejected by the tentacles, whose cilia can switch into reverse. The food then moves down to the stomach, which is in the ampulla. Solid wastes are moved up the intestine and out through the anus, which is outside and slightly below the lophophore.|$|E
5|$|The {{case is a}} tubular {{structure}} made of silk, secreted from salivary glands {{near the mouth of}} the larva, and is started soon after the egg hatches. Various reinforcements may be incorporated into its structure, the nature of the materials and design depending on the larva's genetic makeup; this means that caddifly larvae can be recognised by their cases down to family, and even genus level. The materials used include grains of sand, larger fragments of rock, bark, sticks, leaves, seeds and mollusc shells. These are neatly arranged and stuck onto the outer surface of the silken tube. As the larva grows, more material is added at the front, and the larva can turn round in <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> trim the rear end so that it does not drag along the substrate.|$|E

50|$|To use smaller tubes {{instead of}} conventional-sized tubes in air conditioners, heat {{exchangers}} must be redesigned. This includes redesigning <b>the</b> fin <b>and</b> <b>tube</b> circuits. Design optimization requires {{the use of}} computational fluid dynamics to analyze airflow around <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> <b>and</b> fins, as well as computer simulations of refrigerant flow <b>and</b> temperatures inside <b>the</b> <b>tubes.</b> This is important because the overall heat transfer coefficient of a coil {{is a function of the}} convection of the refrigerant inside <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> to <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> wall, conduction through <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> wall, <b>and</b> dissipation through the fins.|$|R
5|$|The {{lower than}} {{expected}} passenger numbers were {{partly due to}} competition between <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> sub-surface railway companies, but the introduction of electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, took {{a large number of}} passengers away from the trains. The Daily Mirror noted at the end of April 1906 that the BS offered poor value for money compared to the equivalent motor bus service, which cost only 1d. per journey, and that passengers disliked the distances that they had to walk between the trains and the lifts. Such problems were not limited to the UERL; all of London's seven tube lines and the sub-surface DR and Metropolitan Railway were affected to some degree. The reduced revenue generated from the lower passenger numbers made it difficult for the UERL and the other railways to pay back the capital borrowed, or to pay dividends to shareholders.|$|E
5|$|Yūko later rebuilds Syaoran's and Sakura's bodies {{using the}} {{remnants}} left after their apparent deaths. As neither could properly die, Yūko grants their wishes to be reborn as normal humans, which Syaoran accepts because Sakura tells him {{she wants to}} stay with him. As both grow up as normal humans, they meet and live together. He and Sakura have a son, who is the original Syaoran, creating a time paradox. Because they realize that all the previous events would be repeated and their son {{would not be able}} to save the , they seal themselves inside a glass tube hidden in Yūko's shop.

5|$|During final testing, {{engineers}} detected {{that the}} spacecraft's X band (NATO H/I/J bands) communications antenna was transmitting {{only a tiny}} fraction of the power that it should. Thermal imaging showed that the waveguide to the antenna, deep inside the spacecraft, was very hot. Clearly that was where the missing power was being dissipated. The waveguide could not normally be inspected or repaired without major disassembly of the satellite, which would have required a return to the facilities in Europe and resulted in a major delay to the launch. To avoid doing this, a local surgeon was brought in to inspect the component with an endoscope. The surgeon, Tatiana Zykova, discovered that two pieces of ferrite were lodged in <b>the</b> <b>tube,</b> <b>and</b> was able to remove both of them. Engineers were able to assist the removal of the second one with a magnet. It was determined that the ferrite had come from an absorption load installed deep inside the antenna, which was intended to improve its performance. Some ferrite (the remaining stump of this load) was removed from inside the base of the antenna in order to prevent any further debris falling into the waveguide.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study has been to {{construct}} two accelerating tubes with small beam apertures for the Van de Graaff, modifying <b>the</b> prototype <b>tube</b> designed <b>and</b> tested by Wiley (20), to design and construct a vacuum system for evacuating <b>the</b> <b>tubes,</b> <b>and</b> to determine <b>the</b> characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> under operating conditions while installed in the generator...|$|R
5000|$|The {{equipment}} used in manufacturing Microgroove products expands <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> circumferentially (i.e., <b>the</b> circumference of <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> is increased without changing the length). This [...] "non-shrinkage" [...] expansion allows for better control of tube lengths {{in preparation for}} subsequent assembly operations. Tubes are inserted, or laced, into the holes in a stack of precisely spaced fins. Expanders are inserted into <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> diameters are increased slightly until mechanical contact is achieved between <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> <b>and</b> fins. <b>The</b> high ductility of copper allows for this process to be performed accurately and precisely.

25|$|A plasma is {{electrically}} conductive, and {{is subject}} to electric and magnetic fields. In a magnetic field, the electrons and nuclei orbit the magnetic field lines, confining them to the area defined by the field. A simple confinement system is a plasma-filled tube placed inside the open core of a solenoid. The plasma naturally tends to expand outwards to {{the walls of the}} tube, as well as move along it, towards the ends. The solenoid creates a magnetic field running down the centre of <b>the</b> <b>tube,</b> <b>and</b> prevents the plasma particles moving towards the sides. Unfortunately, this arrangement would not confine the plasma along the length of <b>the</b> <b>tube,</b> <b>and</b> the plasma would be free to flow out the ends.|$|E

50|$|Jorongmok is <b>the</b> round <b>tube</b> in <b>the</b> middle {{connecting}} {{the left and}} right side of the hourglass-shaped body. The size of the jorongmok determines the quality of the tone: <b>the</b> wider <b>the</b> <b>tube,</b> <b>the</b> deeper <b>and</b> huskier it sounds; <b>the</b> narrower <b>the</b> <b>tube,</b> <b>the</b> harder <b>and</b> snappier it sounds.|$|R
25|$|The {{thoracic}} {{region of}} the body consists of seven chaetigers (segments bearing chaetae). Chaetae are small appendages that aid the worm with mobility. The first of these segments is the collar segment (peristomium), to which the prostomium is attached. The peristomium bears an elaborate, delicate, membranous collar that overlaps {{the margins of the}} aperture of <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> covers the opening of the tube when the head is extended.|$|E
25|$|Another hazard is the {{resonance}} of the magnetron tube itself. If the microwave is run without an object {{to absorb the}} radiation, a standing wave will form. The energy is reflected {{back and forth between}} <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> the cooking chamber. This may cause the tube to overload and burn out. For the same reason, dehydrated food, or food wrapped in metal which does not arc, is problematic for overload reasons, without necessarily being a fire hazard.|$|E
25|$|A {{catastrophic failure}} is one which {{suddenly}} makes the vacuum tube unusable. A {{crack in the}} glass envelope will allow air into <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> destroy it. Cracks may result from stress in the glass, bent pins or impacts; tube sockets must allow for thermal expansion, to prevent stress in the glass at the pins. Stress may accumulate if a metal shield or other object presses on the tube envelope and causes differential heating of the glass. Glass may also be damaged by high-voltage arcing.|$|E

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} {{mathematical model}} with a free moving boundary was introduced to study viscous flow in stenotic elastic tubes subject to a prescribed external pressure at <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> wall <b>and</b> pulsatile pressure drop between <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> inlet <b>and</b> outlet. An iterative numerical method using boundary iteration, pseudocompressibility, and the ADI technique was developed to solve the model. Unsteady effects of stenosis severity and the imposed pressure conditions on <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> wall <b>and</b> flow are studied. Special {{attention was paid to}} tube contractions because they can be indications of <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> collapsing. It was found that stenosis can cause more severe <b>tube</b> expansion <b>and</b> contraction under unsteady conditions. The complicated unsteady wall motion can be understood as the superposition of <b>the</b> static <b>tube</b> expansion <b>and</b> contraction caused by the stenosis <b>and</b> as <b>the</b> unsteady <b>tube</b> expansion <b>and</b> contraction caused by the imposed, unsteady pressure conditions...|$|R
