Current conception of the Big Bang model assumes the existence of energy, time, and space, and does not comment about their origin or the cause of the dense and high temperature initial state of the universe.|$|E
5|$|The dorsal and pelvic fins are angular, {{with the}} first dorsal fin larger than the second. The {{pectoral}} fins are narrow, pointed, and falcate (sickle-shaped); their shape separates this species from the similar-looking nurse shark. <b>The</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first dorsal fin is about even with <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pelvic fins, while <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anal fin is even with or somewhat behind <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second dorsal fin. The caudal fin has a shallow upper lobe and barely present lower lobe, comprising {{about a quarter of}} the total length in adults. The dermal denticles are diamond-shaped, bearing 45 faint ridges radiating from a blunt point. Tawny nurse sharks are yellowish, reddish, or grayish brown above and off-white below, and are capable of slowly changing their color to better blend with the environment. Young sharks have starkly white lower eyelids.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> endomembrane {{system is}} linked to the origin of eukaryotes {{themselves}} and the origin of eukaryoties to the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria. Many models have been put forward to explain <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> endomembrane system (reviewed in). The most recent concept suggests that the endomembrane system evolved from outer membrane vesicles the endosymbiotic mitochondrion secreted. This OMV-based model for <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> endomembrane system is currently the one that requires the least amount of novel inventions at eukaryote origin and explains the many connections of mitochondria with other compartments of the cell.|$|E
