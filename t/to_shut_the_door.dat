25|$|Both teams swapped {{field goals}} {{for the first two}} periods. The third was scoreless, despite an {{opportunity}} for Arkansas <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> with a field goal attempt. Arkansas then scored on a Matt Jones run, but failed the two-point conversion, which is required versus an extra point in the third overtime or later. The Volunteers answered the call on their first play, a 25-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Tony Brown, but the Volunteers also failed the two, sending the game into a fifth extra period.|$|E
25|$|Bryant {{moved back}} to the buses where Janet Quin lay injured from the earlier shot. Bryant shot her in the back, then left; she later died from her wounds. Bryant then went onto one of the coaches and fired a shot at Elva Gaylard who was hiding inside, hitting her in the arm and chest and killing her. At an {{adjacent}} coach, Gordon Francis saw what happened and moved down the aisle to try <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the coach he was on. He was seen by Bryant and shot from the opposite coach. He survived, but needed four major operations.|$|E
25|$|In 1974–75, Dave Schultz topped {{his mark}} from the {{previous}} season by setting an NHL record for penalty minutes with 472. Clarke's efforts earned him his second Hart Trophy and Parent was the lone recipient of the Vezina Trophy. The Flyers as a team improved their record slightly with a mark of 51–18–11, {{the best record in}} the NHL. After a first-round bye, the Flyers easily swept the Toronto Maple Leafs and were presented with another New York-area team in the Semi-finals. The Flyers looked to be headed toward another sweep against the New York Islanders after winning the first three games. The Islanders, however, fought back by winning the next three games, setting up a deciding seventh game. The Flyers were finally able <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> on the Islanders, winning Game 7, 4–1.|$|E
50|$|In 1985, however, it {{was decided}} a new {{municipal}} use for Virreina and the Museum of Decorative Arts had <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> again. <b>The</b> collections were {{moved back to the}} Palace of Pedralbes and stored in this building reserves for a decade.|$|R
50|$|Hopper's crew have {{repaired}} the ship, and the Doctor rewires {{the controls}} {{to the station}} so they can't be used. He then sets up a circuit to electrify <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> again, along with the control panels and the hatch. The Controller, still alive, lurches for them. Everyone tries <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> outer <b>doors</b> using insulating poles, but the Controller is too strong. Toberman comes forward, pushes the others aside and uses his bare hands <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors.</b> He succeeds, completing the circuit, and both he and the Controller are electrocuted.|$|R

500|$|In January 1941, Berryman became Commander, Royal Artillery, in Arthur [...] "Tubby" [...] Allen's 7th Division, and was {{promoted}} to brigadier. During the Syria-Lebanon campaign, Berryman demonstrated {{that he was a}} thrusting commander who led from the front and repeatedly demonstrated his coolness under fire. When his headquarters came under shell fire for the first time, Berryman sat calmly eating his breakfast [...] "among the flying brick dust and bursting shells", simply telling the men <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> [...] "so they can eat breakfast without being covered in dust".|$|E
500|$|After making three {{separate}} returns in September 2013, September 2014 {{and another in}} February 2015 to commemorate 30 years of EastEnders in EastEnders Live Week, Windsor made an unannounced return to EastEnders in 2016, appearing in the episode broadcast on 15 January. After this, {{it was announced that}} the character was to be killed off, losing her battle with breast cancer. The scenes were filmed in secret in November 2015, following Windsor's personal decision for Peggy to be killed. She said: [...] "Peggy is a character close to my heart but I made the decision a while ago that I need to say goodbye to Peggy once and for all as otherwise she will always be there, urging me to go back and that is something I need <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> on. After thinking long and hard about it, I realised that it is time for me and the audience to say our final farewells to the lady who I have loved for many years and I thought that whilst , who I adore, is still in charge I want him {{to be the one to}} oversee it. I am grateful that Dominic has accepted my decision and together, since late last summer, we have been secretly plotting Peggy’s last scenes." [...] Treadwell-Collins said, [...] "when [...] told me her decision back in the summer , we both had a little cry before getting excited about how Peggy Mitchell, the matriarch to end all matriarchs could bid her final farewell to Albert Square. In Peggy Mitchell, Barbara has created one of the greatest ever characters on British television, someone who has become as synonymous with EastEnders as The Queen Vic itself. So this is the end of an EastEnders era. But it is also an opportunity to send Peggy Mitchell out in style in what will be one of the most heartbreaking, uplifting and epic exits an EastEnders character has ever had. We can't wait to have Barbara back at EastEnders, even if it is for the final time. The most professional of professionals on set and off, and a true friend, we have all been working harder than ever to make Barbara and Peggy Mitchell proud." [...] Windsor resumed filming on 21 March 2016.|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, Pullman {{supported}} the Let Books Be Books campaign to stop children’s books being labelled as ‘for girls’ or ‘for boys’, saying: [...] "I'm against anything, from age-ranging to pinking and blueing, whose effect is <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{in the face}} of children who might enjoy coming in. No publisher should announce on the cover of any book the sort of readers the book would prefer. Let the readers decide for themselves".|$|E

6000|$|... "Keep back!" [...] he shouted; [...] "we {{must wait}} until we are all up, and then drive them headlong before us and follow them into the castle. If they have once time <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> there we shall have a {{troublesome}} task." [...] As he spoke he yielded {{his place in the}} front rank to one of his followers, and turned to see how matters stood behind. [...] "Are they all up?" [...] he asked.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{he has an}} {{engagement}} at the hotel, but he will probably drop in later. Come in, Clemmy, I want to talk <b>to</b> you. <b>Shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and sit down." ...|$|R
2500|$|Aslan then {{commands}} Peter <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> on Narnia, and {{he leads}} {{them into his}} country, a platonic ideal of Narnia. He greets Emeth, a devout yet kind Tash-worshipping Calormene, telling him that [...] "I and Tash are of such different kinds that no service which is vile {{can be done to}} me, and none which is not vile can be done to him." [...] As they get [...] "further up and further in", the Narnians find Aslan's country getting bigger and better, eventually encompassing Earth as well. Digory, Polly, Peter, Edmund, Lucy, Eustace, and Jill learn that they have died, or rather, passed into Aslan's country, which is more real than the [...] "Shadowlands" [...] (to use Lewis's own word) from which they have come.|$|E
2500|$|Again, the Halos nearly {{reached the}} World Series in the [...] postseason. Baylor was gone, {{but among the}} new {{additions}} were American League Rookie of the Year runner-up Wally Joyner and pitcher Chuck Finley. Champions of the AL West for the third time, the Angels faced the AL East champions Boston Red Sox in the ALCS. Leading in the series 3 games to 1, the Angels were one out away from defeating Boston {{and going to the}} World Series {{for the first time in}} their history. Leading 5–2 in the top of the ninth inning of Game 5, starter Mike Witt surrendered a two-run home run to former Angel Don Baylor, cutting the Angels' lead to 5–4. After reliever Gary Lucas hit Rich Gedman with his first and only pitch, closer Donnie Moore came in <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Though twice the Angels were one strike away from the Series, Moore gave up a two-out, two-strike, two-run home run to Dave Henderson that put Boston ahead 6–5.|$|E

6000|$|... "'I won't say at present,' I answered, 'whether I doubt or not. Let me {{make sure}} that I {{understand}} you first. You propose, if I am not mistaken, <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of this place on Mr. Armadale, and not to let him out again until he has agreed to the terms which it is our interest to impose on him? May I ask, in that case, how you mean to make him walk into the trap that you have set for him here?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Take a seat. And {{would you}} please <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> street <b>door</b> first? I can't very well do it myself; because my back's so bad, and my legs are so queer.' ...|$|R

5000|$|By 1900, output was at {{an all-time}} low and the then owner James Smithwick was advised by {{auditors}} <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of <b>the</b> brewery. Instead, James reduced the range of beers they produced and set out to find new markets. He secured military contracts and soon after saw output increase again. James' son, Walter, took control in 1930 and steered the brewery to success through the hardships of both World War II and increasingly challenging weather conditions. [...] By January 1950, Smithwick's was exporting ale to Boston.|$|R
50|$|Support for {{immigration}} restrictions, which {{began at the}} turn of the century and had built steadily for twenty years, led to congressional passage of the National Origins Act. This legislation severely restricted the total number of foreigners who would be allowed to enter the United States legally in any given year. It also instituted a quota system intentionally designed to hit Asia and eastern and southern Europe the hardest. <b>The</b> impact was <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of <b>the</b> country to Asians altogether and slow the flood of Italians, Poles, and Russians to a bare trickle of what it had been.|$|R
60|$|Philip took it {{and inhaled}} the smoke with delight. It soothed him extraordinarily. When Sally had {{finished}} Athelny told her <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> after her.|$|E

50|$|Beyond Cologne the {{division}} swept up Paderborn in its advance, <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> back <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ruhr Pocket. In April, {{the division}} crossed the Saale River, north of Halle, and sped {{on toward the}} Elbe River.|$|R
60|$|Having {{got rid of}} the ladies, {{the fiery}} man of war led his victim--if we may so style him--into the {{apartment}} referred <b>to,</b> and <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Without asking Lawrence to be seated, he stalked {{into the middle of the}} room.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the company}} of Jonathan the lazar and Hugh the Hand, the two descend to the Chamber of the Damned, {{actually}} the Seventh Gate. Alfred opens <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to Death's Gate, entering a hallway and preparing <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> at both ends. Hugh the Hand takes {{a great deal of}} interest in it, and, when pressed by Haplo, he reverts to his normal appearance: Xar, Lord of the Nexus, come to finish what he has started: the collapse of the four realms back into one world, one he will rule. [...] "Do no violence," [...] intones the lazar Jonathan, but no one is listening.|$|R

60|$|The king, who {{delighted in}} music, had {{frequent}} concerts at court, to which I was sometimes carried, {{and set in}} my box on a table to hear them: but the noise {{was so great that}} I could hardly distinguish the tunes. I am confident that all the drums and trumpets of a royal army, beating and sounding together just at your ears, could not equal it. My practice was to have my box removed from the place where the performers sat, as far as I could, then <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> and windows of it, and draw the window curtains; after which I found their music not disagreeable.|$|R
