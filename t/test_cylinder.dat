40|$|It was endeavoured {{to measure}} the in-line and {{transverse}} forces that act on a cylinder placed near a plane boundary in oscillatory flow. The value of performing such work is that it provides information on the forces that may be exerted by surf ace waves on a pipeline or cable mounted near the sea bed. Investigations were carried out in a laboratory, using a water filled flume. The <b>test</b> <b>cylinder</b> was attached to a plywood surface which was fastened to an hydraulic ram which could oscillate horizontally in a sinusoidal mode.

40|$|Abstract. Multi-axial {{mechanical}} testing with servo-hydraulic cylinders is used {{as essential}} tool within the development and manufacturing process of mechanical components and structures, enabling the experimental validation of the fatigue behavior and related mechanical endurance limits. In this paper we derive the analytical model of servo-hydraulic cylinders feasible for fatigue tests to enable the incorporation of the derived actuator dynamics within multi-axis test control strategies. Our derived cylinder model includes the <b>test</b> <b>cylinder</b> with attached position sensor, and a state-of-the-art servo valve. Based on the obtained cylinder dynamics we propose a simplification to a low order cylinder model, highly desirable for reducing overall system complexity {{in order to develop}} ease-of-use controllers of high performance for multi-dimensional test rigs. We compare the simulated output of the derived actuator models with the measured data from a real world <b>test</b> <b>cylinder</b> system. The obtained results show that the obtained system model accurately describes the dynamic properties of a real world <b>test</b> <b>cylinder,</b> and furthermore validates the process of model simplification for efficient control of such cylinders as part of low-bandwidth multi input multi output servo-hydraulic test systems...|$|E

The merits of this technology are to get the minimum power required, and the highly dense energy for cutting using small jet diameters. But, it is hard for this technology to peel wide skins of relatively soft objects. In this report, plain water jet technology with low pressure, below 3 MPa, is investigated for peeling the skin of circular objects, such as vegetables. Eight flat nozzles 45 degrees apart are installed in a concentric circle. The axes of nozzles intersect {{at the center of the}} circle, and the plain water jets are on the same plane. A <b>test</b> <b>cylinder</b> is set among the nozzles, in order to measure static pressure on its surface.

Next, a burdock is set instead of a <b>test</b> <b>cylinder,</b> pulled up with constant velocity and peeled by plain water jets.

40|$|There is {{observed}} deviation of endurance in dynamic and static sealings in the hydrau-lic system {{of an airplane}} which is suspected {{to be caused by}} differences in material and quality between different manufacturers. In order to find out and verify these dif-ferences series of comparing tests were conducted on specifically made test equip-ment. The main goal of this Master’s Thesis was to perform the needed tests on the seals and to evaluate the test results. The test system consisted of a hydraulically driven <b>test</b> <b>cylinder</b> which was able to test both the dynamic and static seal. The <b>test</b> <b>cylinder</b> was designed {{in such a way that}} it could be used to test two sealing systems at the same time. The test was conducted in conditions that resembled real life usage. The main points were that pressure, tempera-ture and movement speed were the same as in the original application. Control logic was used to run the <b>test</b> <b>cylinder</b> continuously from one end to the other. During the test the force needed to move the cylinder was monitored. From this force the friction and the deviation of friction behavior in dynamic seal during the test were computed. Leakage was monitored both on the dynamic seal and on the static seal. Pressures, position and temperature were also used as survey measures. Speed of the <b>test</b> <b>cylinder</b> was calculated from position. The system allowed testing of two piston seals, two rod seals and two O-rings simultaneously. Both piston seal and rod seal were T-seals. T-seals consist of a T-shaped elastomer sealing element supported by back-up rings on both sides. The wearing of seals was determined by change of weight before and after the experiment. The possible effect of absorption of fluid on the mass and properties of the sealing was examined with separate tests. The properties of the seals between the two manufacturers differed in the present study and the seals of manufacturer 2 lasted wearing better than the seals of manufacturer 1.

In the case of steady flow, perfect resonance appears in the locked-in range, but in waves, it appears only close to ratios of wave frequency fw to the natural frequency fnw of the cylinder in still water in the sequence of fw/fnw = 1 / 2, 1 / 3, 1 / 4,…; elsewhere vortex coupling may occur for light damping in which the oscillation frequency is not a simple multiple of wave frequency. <br/...|$|E

Materials adopted for the tests were annealed S 45 C and SCM 21 steels (by JIS) which were typical gear materials, and two kinds of surface condition, as turned and as ground, were prepared in each steel.
