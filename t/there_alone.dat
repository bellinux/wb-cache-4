5|$|After tearfully reuniting {{with his}} son and new daughter-in-law, Walter discovers the device uses a unique {{radioactive}} signature that they can track. The strongest source points to a used campground, where Peter discovers a key. He recognizes the key as from Walter's old home near Reiden Lake and travels <b>there</b> <b>alone,</b> and finds his biological father, Walternate, present. Walternate admits to being behind the End of Dayers group, as his revenge for Peter activating the doomsday device and destroying the parallel world that was his home. Walternate promises that Peter will face the same pain and suffering he has faced since crossing to the prime universe on a mission of mercy, one piece at a time. Peter realizes that Walternate is implying a threat to Olivia, and finds that Walternate was speaking to him remotely through a holographic simulation. In Central Park, where Moreau has set off another breach to expose an existing wormhole, Olivia is helping to cordon off the breach when Walternate approaches and shoots her. Peter {{and the rest of}} Fringe division struggle with her death at her funeral.|$|E

25|$|Charles II Hayne {{was only}} 22 when he {{inherited}} Lupton in 1769 and he built Lupton House which largely survives today. He did not marry but lived <b>there</b> <b>alone</b> for about twenty years. In 1788 he sold Lupton to Judge Francis Buller and made Fuge House his principal residence. He died in 1821, having bequeathed Fuge House to his great-nephew Charles I Seale-Hayne (d.1842) (on condition he should adopt the additional surname of Hayne), the second son of Sir John Henry Seale, 1st Baronet (1780–1844), of Mount Boone, Dartmouth, {{the son of}} his sister Sarah Hayne.

25|$|Mr. Trowbridge {{returned}} from the school {{to say that the}} only hope for safety to any Americans seemed to be to return to the school, staying <b>there</b> <b>alone,</b> separated from the Armenians. He declared that we were powerless to save the Armenians. It seems that after we left the school, Miss Wallace, Mr. Chambers, and a young Armenian preacher attempted to cross the street from Miss Wallace's to the school. Just at this time a mob rushed around the corner. The infuriated Turks recognized the preacher as an Armenian, and although Mr. Chambers threw his arms about him and did all in his power to save the man's life, they shot him dead. Not a single Armenian would they leave alive, the assassins shouted, as Mr. Chambers dragged the murdered preacher into the building.|$|E

And I was dancin' on the rocks there... right on the rocks where the waves were, like, blowin' and splashin'. Really, it was so fantastic.

Shelby eventually arrives, and sets the place ablaze while Madison is still there. Madison may die in the blaze, or the player may manage to have her escape. If she escapes and has found Shaun's location, the player may have her phone and tell either Norman or Ethan it, or have her go <b>there</b> <b>alone.</b> If the player fails to find the address and/or dies, she will be removed from play for the final level where the killer is confronted.|$|E
25|$|Mr. Aikman, having pursued {{his studies}} {{for some time}} in Britain, found that to {{complete}} them {{it would be necessary}} to go into Italy, to form his taste on the fine models of antiquity, which <b>there</b> <b>alone</b> can be found in abundance. And as he perceived that the profession he was to follow, could not permit him to manage properly his paternal estate, situated in a remote place near Arbroath-in the county of Forfar in Scotland, he thought proper to sell it, and settle all family claims upon him, that he might be at full liberty to pursue his studies. In 1707, he went to Italy, and having resided chiefly at Rome for three years, and taken instructions from, and formed an acquaintance with the principal artists of that period, he chose to gratify his curiosity by travelling into Turkey. He went first to Istanbul (then known as Constantinople), and from thence to Smyrna. There he became acquainted with all the British gentlemen of the factory; who wished him to forsake the pencil, and to join them in the Turkey trade: but, that scheme not taking place, he went once more to Rome, and pursued his former studies there, till 1712, when he returned to his native country: he now followed his profession of painting for sometime, applauded by the discerning few; though the public, too poor at that period to be able to purchase valuable pictures, were unable to give adequate encouragement to his superior merit John Duke of Argyll, who equally admired the artist and esteemed the man, regretting that such talents should be lost, at length prevailed on Mr. Aikman to move with all his family to London, in 1723, thinking this the only theatre in Britain where his talents could be properly displayed. Under the auspices of this nobleman, he formed habits of intimacy with the first artists, particularly with Sir Godfrey Kneller, whose studies and dispositions of mind were very congenial to his own.|$|E

500|$|During its {{observed}} history, {{the volume}} of lava erupted by Kīlauea has varied widely. In 1823 Kīlauea's summit caldera was far deeper than it is today, but {{was in the process}} of filling up under nearly continuous summit eruption, with [...] of lava erupted <b>there</b> <b>alone</b> by 1840. The period between 1840 and 1920 saw approximately half that in eruptive volume, and in the thirty years between then and about 1950, the volcano was unusually quiet and exhibited very little activity; Kīlauea's eruptive volume has increased steadily since then, with present activity comparable to that of the early 1800s.|$|E
500|$|However, {{at times}} Rosebery's {{behaviour}} could be eccentric. Gladstone remarked that Rosebery was, perhaps, rather too concerned with his health. Early {{in the marriage}} Rosebery decided to renovate the small ruined Barnbougle Castle (the original Rosebery family seat), close to, and within sight of, Dalmeny House. Once renovation was complete in 1882, Rosebery {{used it as a}} private retreat from his family, and began to spend his nights <b>there</b> <b>alone.</b> Always an insomniac, he claimed that the [...] "stillness of the waters [...] were conducive to sleep." [...] Books were his passion, and he assembled a huge library in the small castle. Thus Rosebery was able to lead a life at Dalmeny with his wife, but also quite apart from her.|$|E

500|$|A {{read-through}} {{took place}} in Cardiff on Thursday, 8 July and production started on 12 July 2010 and lasted into August 2010. The episode marked the debut of Michael Pickwood as the new set designer. Pickwood and Haynes worked together to create the town, incorporating elements that would be needed {{in a society that}} shared its daily life with fish. Nearly all windows in the town are round, reminiscent of submarines. The structures were made out of metal, filmed at a local steel works. Kazran's study was designed to be very large, as Kazran spent several scenes in <b>there</b> <b>alone</b> and would feel [...] "dwarfed" [...] by it. The walls were intended to look like copper that had turned green, which when combined with the red drapes created the Christmas colours of red and green. The painting of Kazran's father was created by taking a picture of Gambon, lightly printing it on a canvas, and painting in the details. Kazran's controls were inspired by a church organ.|$|E
500|$|The {{regiment}} {{spent most}} of April on patrol and guard duties {{to the west of}} the River Jordan. The Rugby football team were presented, by Lieutenant-General Harry Chauvel, commanding the Desert Mounted Corps, with the division's cup for being the champion team. The second raid across the Jordan on Es Salt began on 29 April, with the brigade initially being held in reserve. The operation had similar problems as the first raid, and on 30 April the brigade was moved forward. The Wellington Mounted Rifles and Canterbury Mounted Rifles were ordered to support the assault by the infantry at Nimrin, while the regiment remained in reserve. At 09:30 the 4th Squadron was sent forward to support the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, but a Turkish artillery barrage, by at least four batteries, landed to their front, preventing them going forward. The artillery fire increased and the rest of the regiment had to retire to put the horses out of harm's way. Without making further progress that day, the regiment returned to the Ghoraniyeh bridgehead for the night. More Turkish reinforcements arrived overnight and opposition to any British advance was increasing. Eventually the regiment was ordered to gallop forward to the front line, deploying to cover [...] along the track from Es Salt. One of the first things they observed was a party of RHA artillerymen going back without their guns, which they had been forced to abandon. The 3rd and 4th Squadrons began digging trenches, as the regiment had to hold a position covering the only way back for the 4th Light Horse Brigade, to their front. On 2 May the Australians were ordered to withdraw, reaching the regiment's position the next day. That night the regiment withdrew to a ford at Auja, where engineers were constructing a pontoon bridge. The regiment remained <b>there</b> <b>alone</b> the next day while the rest of the NZMRB returned to their previous camp near Jericho. The regiment was relieved the next day and rejoined the brigade.|$|E
2500|$|The twins {{decided to}} sell their {{individual}} homes and purchase a joint property in 2011, {{with the goal of}} establishing a hub for their extended family and friends.

[...] Jonathan moved in first, living <b>there</b> <b>alone</b> for three years before they began improvements. With a renovation budget of $2 million, the project became the basis of a fourth television series, Property Brothers: At Home.
