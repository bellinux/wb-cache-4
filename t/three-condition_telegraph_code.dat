5000|$|In Western Australia a {{code book}} (Uniform and Supplementary <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Code)</b> was issued {{as late as}} 1967 by the Western Australian Government Railways, with a preface that {{included}} the wording:This <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Code</b> has been agreed to by the Railway Commissioners of Government Railways of the Commonwealth of Australia, and applied to the Western Australian RailwaysAs well as the indication ofThe code words printed in capitals are applicable throughout the Railways of the Commonwealth; those printed small type apply to the Western Australian Railways only ...|$|R

5000|$|The Chinese <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Code,</b> Chinese Telegraphic Code, or Chinese Commercial Code ( [...] or [...] ) is a four-digit decimal code (character encoding) for {{electrically}} telegraphing messages {{written with}} Chinese characters.|$|R
50|$|ASCII was {{developed}} from <b>telegraph</b> <b>code.</b> Its first commercial use {{was as a}} seven-bit teleprinter code promoted by Bell data services. Work on the ASCII standard began on October 6, 1960, with {{the first meeting of}} the American Standards Association's (ASA) (now the American National Standards Institute or ANSI) X3.2 subcommittee. The first edition of the standard was published in 1963, underwent a major revision during 1967, and experienced its most recent update during 1986. Compared to earlier <b>telegraph</b> <b>codes,</b> the proposed Bell code and ASCII were both ordered for more convenient sorting (i.e., alphabetization) of lists, and added features for devices other than teleprinters.|$|R
50|$|The codes were devised {{with many}} {{features}} {{common to all}} states, with states devising additional codes for their own use if required. The codes were listed either on a large poster or in a <b>telegraph</b> <b>code</b> book.|$|R
50|$|In late 1919, Tranow reconstructed Britain's {{enormous}} Government <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Code</b> {{which was}} used by the Admiralty to carry reports about warships. Later in the 1920s it used the broken code to enable the Germans to track British gunboat activity on the Yangtze.|$|R
50|$|The New South Wales telegraphic code library {{consisted}} of 404 code words. These 404 <b>telegraph</b> <b>code</b> words eliminated {{the need to}} type 3703 normal words as sentences on a telegraph, therefore saving time and reducing the likelihood of errors in the sending of messages.|$|R
50|$|Chinese <b>telegraph</b> <b>code</b> is used {{extensively}} {{in law enforcement}} investigations worldwide that involve ethnic Chinese subjects where variant phonetic spellings of Chinese names can create confusion. Dialectical differences (Mr. Wu in Mandarin becomes Mr. Ng in Cantonese) and differing romanization systems (Mr. Xiao in the Hanyu pinyin system, and Mr. Hsiao in the Wade Giles system) can create serious problems for investigators, but can be remedied by application of Chinese <b>telegraph</b> <b>code.</b> For instance, investigators following a subject in Taiwan named Hsiao Ai-Kuo might not know {{this is the same}} person known in mainland China as Xiao Aiguo and Hong Kong as Siu Oi-Kwok until codes are checked for the actual Chinese characters to determine all match as CTC: 5618/1947/0948 for 萧爱国 (simplified) / 蕭愛國 (traditional).|$|R
50|$|The Chinese <b>telegraph</b> <b>code</b> can be {{used for}} a Chinese input method for {{computer}}s. Ordinary computer users today hardly master it because it needs a lot of rote memorization. However, the related four corner method, which allows one to look up characters by shape, is used.|$|R
50|$|Early binary {{repertoires}} include Bacon's cipher, Braille, International maritime signal flags, and the 4-digit encoding of Chinese characters for a Chinese <b>telegraph</b> <b>code</b> (Hans Schjellerup, 1869). Common {{examples of}} character encoding systems include Morse code, the Baudot code, the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) and Unicode.|$|R
50|$|In telecommunication, frequency-change {{signaling}} is a telegraph signaling {{method in}} which one or more particular frequencies correspond to each desired signaling condition of a <b>telegraph</b> <b>code.</b> The transition from one set of frequencies to the other may be a continuous or a discontinuous change in the frequency or phase.|$|R
50|$|It was deduced {{that the}} machine had twelve wheels {{and used a}} Vernam {{ciphering}} technique on message characters in the standard 5-bit ITA2 <b>telegraph</b> <b>code.</b> It did this by combining the plaintext characters with a stream of key characters using the XOR Boolean function to produce the ciphertext.|$|R
5000|$|The first <b>telegraph</b> <b>code</b> for Chinese {{was brought}} into use soon after the Great Northern Telegraph Company ( [...] / [...] Dàběi Diànbào Gōngsī) {{introduced}} telegraphy to China in 1871. Septime Auguste Viguier, a Frenchman and customs officer in Shanghai, published a codebook (Viguier 1872), succeeding Danish astronomer Hans Carl Frederik Christian Schjellerup’s earlier work.|$|R
50|$|Early optical {{character}} recognition may be traced to technologies involving telegraphy and creating reading devices for the blind. In 1914, Emanuel Goldberg developed a machine that read characters and converted them into standard <b>telegraph</b> <b>code.</b> Concurrently, Edmund Fournier d'Albe developed the Optophone, a handheld scanner that when moved across a printed page, produced tones that corresponded to specific letters or characters.|$|R
25|$|Before the 1980s, Chinese {{publishers}} hired {{teams of}} workers and selected a few thousand type pieces from an enormous Chinese character set. Chinese government agencies entered characters using a long, complicated list of Chinese <b>telegraph</b> <b>codes,</b> which assigned different numbers to each character. During the early computer era, Chinese characters were categorized by their radicals or Pinyin romanization, but results were less than satisfactory.|$|R
50|$|In the 1830s {{the first}} {{commercial}} telegraph system was constructed in England. Over time the system was perfected and across the world overhead telegraph lines were built at rapid pace to connected towns and countries. The telegraph system allowed immediate communications by Morse <b>telegraph</b> <b>codes</b> to pass important government, commercial and private messages which up until then were delivered by mail on coaches and horseback.|$|R
5000|$|Baron Pavel L'vovitch Schilling, {{also known}} as Paul Schilling (5 April 1786, Reval (now, Tallinn), Russian empire - St. Petersburg, Russia, 25 July 1837), was a diplomat of Baltic German origin {{employed}} {{in the service of}} Russia in Germany, and who built a pioneering electrical telegraph. It consisted of a single needle system which used a <b>telegraph</b> <b>code</b> to indicate the characters in a message.|$|R
50|$|These {{encodings}} {{are derived}} from ASCII {{on the base of}} some correspondence between Latin and Cyrillic (nearly phonetical), which was already used in Russian dialect of Morse code and in MTK-2 <b>telegraph</b> <b>code.</b> The first 26 characters from А (0xE1) in KOI8-R are А, Б, Ц, Д, Е, Ф, Г, Х, И, Й, К, Л, М, Н, О, П, Я, Р, С, Т, У, Ж, В, Ь, Ы.|$|R
50|$|The codes {{listed below}} {{are taken from}} the 1939 edition of the <b>Telegraph</b> Message <b>Code</b> book unless stated otherwise.|$|R
60|$|When {{circumstances}} permit, the heliograph {{is sometimes}} used. The {{rays of the}} sun are thrown by a system of mirrors to the point with which it is desired to communicate, and then interrupted by means of a shutter, making dots and dashes as used in the Morse <b>telegraph</b> <b>code.</b> This system is used only when operations ashore are going on, as the rolling of the ship would prevent the concentration of the sun’s rays.|$|R
50|$|Minot further {{developed}} a system using telegraphs for train dispatches, for use when trains {{would want to}} pass one another along the line, such as at stations. Two-letter <b>telegraph</b> <b>codes</b> were designated, and the new modern system was set up. For the ten years of the new railroad's existence, passengers had been disgusted as trains waited for hours as another train had to pass them. This new system would relieve this issue.|$|R
