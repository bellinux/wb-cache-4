The drug was given by mouth in doses of up to 2 g a day for six weeks and there were no adverse effects. Serum concentrations of the intact compound were low and the serum half-time was 4 - 12. 8 days, probably because of a combination of a low clearance rate and a high apparent volume of distribution. Less than 5 % of the ingested dose was excreted unchanged in the urine. Circulating concentrations of 5 -ASA and N-acetyl- 5 -ASA were low and 30 % of the equivalent daily dose was excreted in the urine, predominantly as N-acetyl- 5 -ASA. In most subjects more than 30 % of the equivalent daily dose of 5 -ASA was recovered from the faeces, either as 5 -ASA itself or as the acetylated derivative.

Particle formation is salt-dependent and yields perfectly spherical nanoparticles of 120 to 800 nm diameter, depending on buffer composition and temperature, with a stoichiometry of 1 : 2. 5 for the cationic and anionic peptides. The anionic peptide forms an &# 945;-helix in aqueous solution, has all five glutamates {{on one side}} of the helix, and exists entirely as a discrete oligomer of 9 − 10 peptides. A rigid oligomer with 45 − 50 negative charges almost certainly represents the core component of these nanoparticles, held together by electrostatic interactions with the unstructured K 16 peptide. Cells internalize these particles by an endocytic process, and free particles are frequently seen in the cytosol, presumably because of the acid-dependent fusogenic properties of the anionic peptide.

40|$|Strong {{evidence}} has been accumulating that mesalazine (5 - aminosalicylic acid, 5 -ASA) represents the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>moiety</b> of the standard drug sulphasalazine. Since the active metabolite avoids the toxic potential of sulphapyridine, this perception has initiated new therapeutic approaches, for example, two 5 -ASA molecules have been coupled to form another prodrug (olsalazine) which again depends on a proper cleavage of the azobond by bacteria in the colon A more direct way has been applied successfully by administering 5 -ASA itself in special galenic formulation (suppositories, enemas, controlled release preparations) to provide enough active material at the proposed sites of action in the terminal ileum and/or colon. One major advantage of all 5 -ASA compounds, compared to sulphasalazine, is their 10 -fold lower potential (incidence) for inducing allergic reactions or causing intolerance. Aside from rare hypersensitivity reactions, 5 -ASA can cause nausea. vomiting, headache and gastrointestinal disturbances in 1 to 5 % of patients. However, the new azocompound olsalazine induced diarrhea or loose stool in at least 10 to 15 % of the treated patients which might limit its use in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

The combination of hydrophilic cornified cells in hydrophobic intercellular material provides a barrier to both hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances. Within the major group of semisolid preparations, the use of transparent gels has expanded both in cosmetics and in pharmaceutical preparations. In spite of many advantages of gels a major limitation is {{in the delivery of}} hydrophobic drugs. So to overcome this limitation an emulsion based approach is being used so that even a hydrophobic <b>therapeutic</b> <b>moiety</b> can enjoy the unique properties of gels. When gels and emulsions are used in combined form the dosage forms are referred as emulgels. In recent years, there has been great interest in the use of novel polymers which can function as emulsifiers and thickeners because the gelling capacity of these compounds allows the formulation of stable emulsions and creams by decreasing surface and interfacial tension {{and at the same time}} increasing the viscosity of the aqueous phase. In fact, the presence of a gelling agent in the water phase converts a classical emulsion into an emulgel. Emulgels for dermatological use have several favorable properties such as being thixotropic, greaseless, easily spreadable, easily removable, emollient, nonstaining, water-soluble, longer shelf life, bio-friendly, transparent & pleasing appearance. These emulgel are having major advantages on novel vesicular systems as well as on conventional systems in various aspects. Various permeation enhancers can potentiate the effect.

40|$|SummaryThe C-C {{chemokine}} receptor type 5 (CCR 5) is a receptor {{expressed by}} T cells and macrophages {{that serves as}} a coreceptor for macrophage-tropic HIV- 1. Loss of CCR 5 is associated with resistance to HIV- 1. Here, we combine the live-cell-based SELEX with high-throughput sequencing technology to generate CCR 5 RNA aptamers capable of specifically targeting HIV- 1 susceptible cells (as small interfering RNA [siRNA] delivery agent) and inhibiting HIV- 1 infectivity (as antiviral agent) via block of the CCR 5 required for HIV- 1 to enter cells. One of the best candidates, G- 3, efficiently bound and was internalized into human CCR 5 -expressing cells. The G- 3 specifically neutralized R 5 virus infection in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and in vivo generated human CD 4 + T cells with a nanomolar inhibitory concentration 50 %. G- 3 was also capable of transferring functional siRNAs to CCR 5 -expressing cells. Collectively, the cell-specific, internalizing, CCR 5 -targeted aptamers and aptamer-siRNA conjugates offer promise for overcoming some of the current challenges of drug resistance in HIV- 1 by providing cell-type- or tissue-specific delivery of various <b>therapeutic</b> <b>moieties...</b>|$|R

The presence of 2 -cyclodextrins in our DexAMs facilitated complexation and intracellular uptake of hydrophobic anticancer drugs, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and erlotinib, whereas the cationic polyamine backbone allowed for electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged siRNA. The DexAM complexes were found to have minimal cytotoxicity over a wide range of concentrations and were found to efficiently deliver siRNA, thereby silencing the expression of targeted genes. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated that upon appropriate modification with targeting ligands, we were able to simultaneously deliver multiple payloads [...] siRNA against oncogenic receptor, EGFRvIII and anticancer drugs (SAHA or erlotinib) [...] efficiently and selectively to glioblastoma cells.

These therapies can be used in isolation or in combination with other cancer treatments, thereby taking advantage of their ability to target tumors (actively or passively), to respond to physical or chemical stimulation (internal or external) and to deliver therapeutic genes to the cell nuclei.

30|$|The large surface-to-volume {{ratio of}} small {{magnetic}} nanoparticles increases surface energy and, thus, enhancing particle aggregation. As a consequence, chemical reactivity decreases, magnetic properties deteriorate, and clearance within a biological system increases [6 – 9]. Particle stability {{in an aqueous}} vehicle can be augmented by electrostatic repulsion using charged surface coatings and/or surface-associated ions, including OH-, H 3 O+, or buffer ions [10]. The ability to absorb and convert electromagnetic energy into heat distinguishes SPIONs from other nanoassemblies. As heat or 'hyperthermia’ sensitizes living cells to apoptotic stimuli, this unique feature of SPIONs appears specifically beneficial in cancer therapy where temperatures between 40 °C and 45 °C have been demonstrated to synergistically enhance or potentiate chemotherapy and radiation efficacy [11, 12]. Hyperthermia generated by SPIONs following exposure to an alternating magnetic field arises from energy loss associated with oscillation and Néel/Brownian relaxation of the nanoparticle magnetic moment [13]. Stimulus-induced heat generation {{can also be utilized}} to control dissociation of a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>moiety</b> from a thermoresponsive carrier that undergoes reversible volume or sol-gel phase transition within a desired range of 37 °C to 45 °C [14 – 16]. Previously, our laboratory described a novel phospholipid/Fe 3 O 4 nanocomposite designed for stimulus-controlled release of an encapsulated payload via magnetically induced hyperthermia [12]. These results demonstrated the feasibility of immobilizing a 2 - to 3 -nm-thick layer of 1, 2 -dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DPPC) on the surface of SPIONs via high affinity avidin/biotin interactions without negatively affecting magnetically induced heating properties. However, moderate surface charge (zeta potential - 5.0 ± 3.0 mV) afforded by the zwitterionic but charge-neutral phospholipid assembly resulted in limited colloidal stability, which rapidly led to particle aggregation into the micrometer range [12].|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Early {{clinical}} {{response to}} antidepressant treatment {{is an important}} therapeutic goal, considering the psychological, social and economic consequences of depression. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the relationship between the time course of response and the concentration of venlafaxine (V), its active metabolite O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV) and enantiomeric ratios V(+) /V(-) and ODV(+) /ODV(-). METHODS: Depressed inpatients (n= 35) received V orally at a fixed 300 mg daily dose. Accepted comedication included clorazepate (maximum 60 mg/day), zopiclone (maximum 15 mg/day) and low-dose trazodone (maximum 200 mg/day). Severity of depression was assessed on days 0, 4, 7, 11, 14, 21 and 28 (Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale). Blood samples were taken on day 14 and day 28 and submitted to stereoselective determination. All measurements reflected trough steady-state values. First, pattern analysis was used to provide a categorical perspective of clinical response (50 % improvement from baseline depression score). Patients displaying non-response, transient response, early persistent response and delayed persistent response were compared with respect to racemic concentrations and enantiomeric ratios. Second, in a dimensional perspective, mixed-effects modelling was used to analyse severity of depression versus time curves with respect to the possible influence of concentrations and enantiomeric ratios. RESULTS: Comparison of patients with and without persistent response did not reveal any significant difference for V, ODV, V+ODV plasma levels or enantiomeric ratios. Persistent response was significantly associated with less frequent pre-study antidepressant medication and less frequent comedication with zopiclone (day 14) and clorazepate (day 28) during the study. Focus on patients with persistent response (n= 19, 54. 3 %) indicated that early response, first observed before day 14, was associated with significantly higher V+ODV concentration than delayed response (median 725 ng/ml versus 554 ng/ml, P= 0. 023). No difference was found for pre-study medication or comedication during the study. Shorter time to onset of response was significantly associated with lower V(+) /V(-) enantiomeric ratio (r(s) = 0. 48, P< 0. 05). Mixed-effects modelling of depression severity versus time curves in patients with persistent response confirmed that either higher V+ODV plasma level or lower V(+) /V(-) ratio were significantly associated with more rapid decrease of depression score (likelihood ratio tests, P= 0. 012 and P= 0. 046, respectively). CONCLUSION: Considering its modest sample size, naturalistic design and limited observation period, the present study provided preliminary indication that earlier clinical response may occur with higher V+ODV plasma level, extending previous dose-response studies. The hypothesis was also raised that exposure to a more potent noradrenergic <b>therapeutic</b> <b>moiety,</b> as reflected by a lower V(+) /V(-) ratio, may be relevant to early improvement of depression...|$|E

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder among the elderly. It is characterized by memory dysfunction, loss of lexical access, spatial and temporal disorientation and impairment of judgement clinically. Unfortunately, clinical development of drugs for the symptomatic and disease-modifying treatment of AD has resulted in both promise and disappointment. Indeed, a large number of drugs with differing targets and mechanisms of action were investigated with only a few of them being clinically available. The targeted drug delivery to the central nervous system (CNS), for the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as AD, is restricted due to the limitations posed by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) as well as due to opsonization by plasma proteins in the systemic circulation and peripheral side-effects.

Methods : [18 F]FBEM-scVEGF was synthesized by site-specific conjugation of 18 F-FBEM to a thiol group in Cys-tag of scVEGF at room temperature. The functional activity after labeling was tested by immunofluorescence staining, cellular uptake and efflux. The tumor targeting and in vivo properties were evaluated by biodistribution and microPET studies in tumor-bearing mice. Results : The radiolabeling yield and specific activity of [18 F]FBEM-scVEGF were 20. 6 &# 177; 15. 1 % (based on starting [18 F]FBEM, uncorrected, n = 5) and 58. 8 &# 177; 12. 4 GBq/&# 181;mol, respectively. Noninvasive microPET and direct tissue sampling experiments demonstrated that [18 F]FBEM-scVEGF had VEGFR specific tumor uptake in MDA-MB- 435, U 87 MG and 4 T 1 xenograft models. The optimal tumor uptake was achieved at 2 h p. i., which can be partially, but significantly blocked by co-injection of non-labeled scVEGF protein. Overall, [18 F]FBEM-scVEGF showed VEGFR specific tumor uptake. Conclusion : The scVEGF was site-specifically labeled with 18 F via [18 F]FBEM prosthetic group and the tracer [18 F]FBEM-scVEGF exhibited high receptor binding affinity and tumor targeting efficacy. Further study of [18 F] FBEM-scVEGF to evaluate angiogenesis in cancer and other disease types is warranted. </p...|$|R
40|$|Biologics are an {{increasing}} class of pharmaceuticals that possess many therapeutic benefits over typical, small‐molecule drugs, such as; high specificity, reduced frequency of off‐target effects, {{and the ability}} to mimic the body’s own physiological system. Despite these advantages, biologics still suffer from limitations due in part to their inherent protein composition, including; rapid circulatory degradation, renal clearance, and immunogenicity. Consequently, methods to modify biologics have been sought that can ameliorate these limitations yet still maintain their efficacy. PEGylation, defined as the conjugation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to biologics, is one such modification. The coupling of PEG increases the overall molecular weight (MW) of the biologic, resulting in reduced renal clearance, whilst simultaneously acting as a shield to protect against proteolytic degradation. Both of these effects extend the half‐life of coupled biologics and improve their bioavailability. Furthermore, the extended residence times of PEGylated agents leads to an increase in efficacy in comparison to the non‐PEGylated counterpart; since the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>moiety</b> has more opportunities to elicit a response. The shielding effect of PEG is also reported to reduce the immunogenicity of biologics through preventing immune recognition of antigenic epitopes present on the biologic’s surface. The benefits of PEGylation have been well validated {{and there are a number}} of PEGylated agents clinically available, with more in various stages of development. Despite this, however, there is still little known concerning the disposition, metabolism and biological fate of PEGylated proteins. Furthermore, whilst PEGylation can reduce the immunogenicity of a protein, this has not precluded the onset of a new immunogenicity raised against the PEG moiety itself, nor indeed has PEGylation been shown to universally reduce the immunogenicity of coupled proteins. Anti‐drug antibodies (ADAs) and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in both animal studies and patients receiving PEGylated agents. Furthermore, these adverse drug reactions (ADRs) occur against both the PEG and protein moieties of the conjugate. Consequently, there is a real need to understand the fundamental mechanics behind the metabolism, disposition and biological fate of PEGylated biologics, as well as defining the effect of PEGylation on the immune recognition, processing and presentation of the coupled protein. The bioanalysis of PEGylated proteins is hindered by inherent difficulties associated with the PEG moiety. PEG is transparent, non‐fluorescent, contains no ultra‐violet (UV) chromophore, is polydisperse, and is not easily ionised; making analysis by spectroscopy and mass spectrometry difficult. The utility of radiolabeling is also limited due to issues arising from placement of the radiolabel within the conjugate. Consequently, alternative analytical tools are required for the comprehensive bioanalysis of PEGylated proteins. In light of these issues the studies described in this thesis aimed to develop methodologies that can: 1) provide quantitative information concerning the biological fate and disposition of both the PEG and protein moieties of a PEGylated protein, and 2) define the effect of PEGylation on the processes involved in generating an immune response. The first investigation in this thesis involved developing and optimising gel‐based methodology and 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to monitor the kinetics, disposition and biological fate of a model PEGylated protein, 40 KPEG‐insulin, in a rodent disposition study. Male Wistar rats were intravenously administered a single dose of 40 KPEG‐insulin and maintained over a period of 28 days. Plasma and urine samples were collected almost daily and liver and kidneys harvested on days 14 and 28. 1 H NMR and gelbased analysis, incorporating western blotting for both PEG and insulin, and a barium iodide (BaI 2) stain for PEG, revealed that PEG persists in both biological tissues and fluids across 28 day days. However, the anti‐insulin western blots revealed that the insulin moiety was either metabolically cleaved or sequentially degraded from PEG to the extent that no immunodetectable insulin was detected by day 7 in urine, or by day 14 in plasma, and could not be detected at all in liver and kidney tissue on days 14 and 28. However, an in vitro plasma stability study found the insulin moiety of 40 KPEG‐insulin to be stable in plasma over 7 days, indicating that the loss of insulin signal observed in vivo must be occurring following cellular internalisation; potentially allowing for the liberated protein to be immunologically processed. The second investigation in this thesis concerned the effect of PEGylation on in vitro cellular internalisation. A range of different PEG MWs were incubated with dendritic cells (DCs) – a model antigen presenting cell (APC) – and internalisation was assessed by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. These data revealed that DC internalise PEG regardless of MW, suggesting that PEGylation, in terms of MW, may have little effect on the internalisation of a PEGylated biologic by APC – over the clinically relevant PEG MW range used in this study. Thirdly, the effect of PEGylation was assessed on the lysosomal and proteasomal pathways of antigen processing and presentation, events en route to producing an immune response which occur after cellular internalisation. Insulin was conjugated to a range of different MW PEGs and incubated with either lysosomes or proteasomes. PEG was shown to be stable to lysosomal proteolysis over a period of 7 days; however insulin was completely degraded within 2 hours. When coupled to PEG, the insulin moiety was again degraded completely within 2 hours regardless of PEG MW. No PEG MW effect was observed when analysing the peptide repertoires generated between the PEGylated insulin conjugates. Indeed, it was shown that PEGylation provides only local protection against lysosomal degradation at the site of attachment. However, when degraded by proteasomes a PEG MW‐dependent effect was observed. Over 48 hours, insulin was nearly degraded to completion when conjugated to 20 kDa PEG. But when coupled to either 30 or 40 kDa PEG, only ~ 50 % of the insulin moiety was degraded. When analysing the peptide repertoires, again PEG, regardless of MW, provided partial protection at the site of attachment. However, there was much more variation in the peptides generated between each PEGylated insulin. In conclusion, the methods developed in this thesis represent facile, inexpensive analytical tools to comprehensively analyse the disposition, kinetics and biological fate of both the PEG and protein moieties of PEGylated proteins. Furthermore, the investigation presented in this thesis was the first of its kind to demonstrate that cleavage and/or degradation of a PEGylated protein can occur in vivo. Consequently, the methods described in this thesis could be easily used to provide a measure of the pharmacokinetics and tissue retention of PEGylated biologics in man. When analysing the effect of PEGylation on the processing of PEGylated proteins, there was shown to be little difference when processed via the lysosomal pathway of antigen processing. However, based on the peptide repertoires generated PEG did provide local protection against degradation at the site of attachment – suggesting that site‐specific PEGylation, tailored for individual biologics, may provide a viable route to reduce the immunogenicity of the attached protein. Future investigation is warranted to further elucidate the potential effects of PEGylation on immunological events occurring downstream of lysosomal/proteasomal processing...|$|E
40|$|For decades, clinicians {{have used}} liposomes, self-assembled lipid vesicles, as {{nanoscale}} systems to deliver encapsulated anthracycline molecules for cancer treatment. The more recent proposition to combine liposomes with nanoparticles {{remains at the}} preclinical development stages; however, such hybrid constructs present great opportunities to engineer theranostic nanoscale delivery systems, which can combine simultaneous therapeutic and imaging functions. Many novel nanoparticles of varying chemical compositions are being developed in nanotechnology laboratories, but further chemical modification is often required to make these structures compatible with the biological milieu in vitro and in vivo. Such nanoparticles have shown promise as diagnostic and therapeutic tools and generally offer a large surface area that allows covalent and non-covalent surface functionalization with hydrophilic polymers, <b>therapeutic</b> <b>moieties,</b> and targeting ligands. In most cases, such surface manipulation diminishes the theranostic properties of nanoparticles and makes them less stable. From our perspective, liposomes offer structural features that can make nanoparticles biocompatible and present a clinically proven, versatile platform for further enhancement of the pharmacological and diagnostic efficacy of nanoparticles. In this Account, we describe two examples of liposome-nanoparticle hybrids developed as theranostics: liposome-quantum dot hybrids loaded with a cytotoxic drug (doxorubicin) and artificially enveloped adenoviruses. We incorporated quantum dots into lipid bilayers, which rendered them dispersible in physiological conditions. This overall vesicular structure allowed them to be loaded with doxorubicin molecules. These structures exhibited cytotoxic activity and labeled cells both in vitro and in vivo. In an alternative design, lipid bilayers assembled around non-enveloped viral nanoparticles and altered their infection tropism in vitro and in vivo with no chemical or genetic capsid modifications. Overall, we have attempted to illustrate how alternative strategies to incorporate nanoparticles into liposomal nanostructures can overcome some of the shortcomings of nanoparticles. Such hybrid structures could offer diagnostic and therapeutic combinations suitable for biomedical and even clinical applications...|$|R
40|$|Ovarian {{cancer is}} the deadliest gynaecological cancer, with {{less than half of}} {{patients}} surviving five years from diagnosis. The asymptomatic nature of the early disease commonly results in diagnosis at an advanced stage where peritoneal metastases are prevalent, and the disease rapidly develops resistance to platinum-based agents. Innovative treatments are needed to combat this untreatable disease that has a poor prognosis. Adenoviruses (Ad) are versatile gene therapy vehicles that have been studied for six decades. Their wider clinical use has been limited by poor tumour-specificity, pre-existing immunity, and toxicity-inducing off-target delivery. We have generated an Ad 5. 3 D. A 20 vector that is re-targeted to an epithelial cancer-specific marker, αvβ 6 integrin, and fully de-targeted from native interactions ‒ αvβ 3 / 5 integrins, coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR), and human coagulation factor 10 (FX). Ad 5. 3 D. A 20 selectively transduced αvβ 6 + epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells in vitro and clinical ovarian ascites-derived EOC cells ex vivo, including in the presence of neutralising anti-Ad antibodies. In vivo, Ad 5. 3 D. A 20 exhibited significantly reduced off-target accumulation and transduction of the liver, spleen and lungs, relative to Ad 5. Efficacy studies are underway to investigate its oncolytic potential. Furthermore, we explored the potential use of alternative serotypes from the rare seroprevalence subgroup D. A novel Ad 10 vector showed improved resistance from neutralisation and lack of FX binding. Chimaeric Ad 5 vectors pseudotyped with Ad 10, - 15, - 24, - 29, - 48 or - 53 fiber had reduced interactions with CAR, but no binding to CD 46. Our strategy for translation initially is via intraperitoneal delivery of oncolytic vectors, bypassingmany of the barriers presented by systemic delivery, but enabling transduction of disseminated metastases. These exquisitely tumour-targeted vectors may be further modulated to carry <b>therapeutic</b> <b>moieties</b> to complement their direct cell-killing activity via the stimulation of anti-cancer immunity. The generated tropism-modified vectors have significant therapeutic potential {{for a wide range of}} immuno-oncolytic applications...|$|R
40|$|Degeneration of the {{intervertebral}} discs (IVD) is {{a leading}} cause of neck and low back pain. While its aetiology is poorly understood, it is known to begin in the central nucleus pulposus region, leading to degradation of the extracellular matrix and loss of the osmotic, and ultimately mechanical, properties of the IVD. Many current treatments for lower back pain alleviate the pain temporarily but do not restore disc function. Biological regeneration approaches under investigation include administration of matrix-mimicking scaffolds, cells and/or therapeutic factors. Cell-targeting strategies are likely to improve the delivery of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>moieties</b> due to the low cell numbers in the IVD. Single-chain antibody fragments (scFvs) that bind IVD cells were isolated for potential delivery of therapeutics to restore disc function. Neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM 1) was identified as a potential cell surface marker of IVD cells. The most cell-distal domain of NCAM 1 was cloned and expressed in the Escherichia coli periplasm. Phage display technology was used to isolate a human scFv against the recombinant domain by panning a scFv library on the immobilised protein. Binding of the isolated B 5 scFv was confirmed by ELISA and the scFv bound cultured rat astrocytes, as well as bovine nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus cells in immunocytochemical studies. The scFv also successfully labelled cells in bovine spinal cord and six-month and two-year old bovine IVD sections by immunohistochemistry. Taken together, these results illustrate the NCAM 1 -binding potential of B 5 scFv and support a role for the scFv in targeting therapeutics to IVD cells for regeneration of the intervertebral disc. It is anticipated that the described scFv will be employed for targeted gene delivery to IVD cells using scFv-functionalised nanoparticles. Antibody fragments can provide cell-binding moieties at improved cost, time, yield and functionalisation potential over whole antibodies and the work demonstrates the feasibility of the combined protein expression/phage display approach in the isolation of cell-binding antibody fragments for use {{in a wide variety of}} targeting and delivery applications...|$|R
