50|$|A low {{pressure}} area developed within an equatorial trough centered over the southeastern Bay of Bengal on November 22. After tracking northwestward for about <b>twenty-four</b> <b>hours,</b> the <b>system</b> developed into Tropical Cyclone 05B, while located about 815 km (505 mi) east-southeast of Chennai, Tamil Nadu. While moving northward, it intensified into a deep depression at 1800 UTC on November 23. Strengthening continued and early on November 24, the deep depression was upgraded to a cyclonic storm. Later that day, the storm turned northwestward and later curved westward.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new system for {{acquiring}} simultaneously breathing rate and kinetic activity {{over a period of}} <b>twenty-four</b> <b>hours.</b> The <b>system</b> is based on a couple of sensors, which are very light, absolutely noninvasive, and compatible with everyday life. The proposed breathing sensor is cheap and uses a conductive rubber as active material. An analog signal representing the breathing rate is obtained from the sensor's signal, breath by breath, without any averaging or filtering. The kinetic activity sensor is based on a tiny accelerometer whose signal is averaged and filtered, so that both sensors have voltage compatible with a slow data logging...|$|R

Windrows offourcane lines are hand cut and placed across one interrow and then lifted, chopped and loaded by the continuous loader into infield tractor and trailer units which carry bins. The bins are transhiped by forklift trucks onto road haulage units for transport to the factory. The loaders are high capacity machines loading at more than 130 tons/hour and on a <b>twenty-four</b> <b>hour</b> basis. The <b>system</b> is able to handle large tonnages per day.

40|$|Purpose: The {{main purpose}} of this study is to explore the {{potential}} therapeutic effects of intracerebral polymer-based anticonvulsant delivery in treating generalized and partial seizures. Method: Phenytoin (PHT) -loaded polycaprolactone (PCL) microspheres were produced by performing an emulsion process. The actual drug loading and releasing profile was determined using high performance liquid chromatography. Temporal lobe epilepsy model was established by unilateral injections of tetanus toxin into right hippocampus of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. PHT PCL spheres were ipsilaterally injected in the adjacent region. Seizure phenotypes and cortico-electrical discharges were detected and recorded by a <b>twenty-four</b> <b>hours</b> video electroencephalography <b>system</b> equipped with ProFusion. Animals were killed eight weeks after toxin injection, and biocompatibility was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Result: The PCL microspheres were 30 – 50 lm in diameter. In vitro study revealed PCL microspheres released a substantial amount of PHT in the first <b>twenty-four</b> <b>hours</b> following incubation regardless of drug loading percentage, and then demonstrated a steady release until eight weeks. We confirmed the neuronal loss in CA 1 in the lesioned hippocampus of tetanus-treated rats. Spontaneous seizures which resemble human generalized tonic clonic seizures, absence and myoclonic seizures have been observed. The PHT-loaded microsphere implanted rats exhibited a reduced number of convulsive seizures as illustrated by attenuated seizure scores. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the efficacy of PHT-loaded PCL microspheres in attenuating generalized seizures in a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy. This may warrant further studies for focal delivery of polymer-based anticonvulsants in treating partial and secondary generalized seizures...|$|R
