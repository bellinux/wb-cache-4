5|$|Concerned {{about the}} succession, Henry sought to persuade Louis VI {{to accept his}} son, William Adelin, as <b>the</b> <b>legitimate</b> future Duke of Normandy, in {{exchange}} for his son's homage. Henry crossed into Normandy in 1115 and assembled the Norman barons to swear loyalty; he also almost successfully negotiated a settlement with King Louis, affirming William's right to the Duchy in exchange for a large sum of money, but the deal fell through and Louis, backed by his ally Baldwin of Flanders, instead declared that he considered William Clito <b>the</b> <b>legitimate</b> heir to the Duchy.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{there was}} no major hostility {{as a result of}} the {{division}} of loyalty between the royalty and the nobility. In the same year, an English merchant, W.H. Read, controlled Sultan Ali's royal seal in exchange for a promise to liquidate his debts. Read had been an active supporter of Sultan Ali's claims for recognition as <b>the</b> <b>legitimate</b> ruler of Johor and the state's revenue, with the Temenggong as his vassal. As a result of economic and political pressure from these traders, the Governor did consider granting a formal recognition to Sultan Ali as <b>the</b> <b>legitimate</b> ruler of Johor, but in the process, he received a strong protest from the Temenggong and his young son, Abu Bakar.|$|E

5|$|The {{authority}} of the Byzantine emperor as <b>the</b> <b>legitimate</b> Roman emperor was challenged by the coronation of Charlemagne as Imperator Augustus by Pope Leo III in the year 800.

5|$|These Sermons are curious; {{and curious}} for such reason as would make other works despicable.

5|$|A {{few years}} later, in 1835 his native {{province}} of Rio Grande do Sul was engulfed in a secessionist rebellion, the Ragamuffin War. The conflict lasted for almost ten years, and the Count was leading military engagements {{for most of}} that time. He played a decisive role in saving the provincial capital from the Ragamuffin rebels, allowing forces loyal to <b>the</b> <b>legitimate</b> government to secure a key foothold. In 1852, he led a Brazilian division during the Platine War in an invasion of the Argentine Confederation that overthrew its dictator. He was awarded a noble title, eventually raised from baron to viscount and finally to count.|$|E
5|$|Charles, Prince Elector and Duke of Bavaria, {{claimed the}} German territories of the Habsburg dynasty as a {{son-in-law}} of Joseph I, and furthermore presented himself as Charles VI's legitimate imperial successor. If women {{were going to}} inherit, he claimed, then his family should have precedence: his wife, Maria Amalia, {{was the daughter of}} Joseph I. Both Charles VI and his predecessor Joseph I had died without sons. Charles of Bavaria suggested that <b>the</b> <b>legitimate</b> succession pass to Joseph's female children, rather than to the daughters of the younger brother, Charles VI. For different reasons, Prussia, France, Spain and the Polish-Saxon monarchy supported Charles of Bavaria's claim to the Habsburg territory and the Imperial title and reneged on the Pragmatic Sanction.|$|E
5|$|During the Investiture Controversy, both <b>the</b> <b>legitimate</b> Popes {{as well as}} Antipope Clement III {{developed}} another, {{not entirely}} new, practice. They appointed their cardinals to the important Episcopal sees in Italy in order to assure their government by their own trusted collaborators. Antipope Clement III named cardinals Hugo Candidus and Roberto of S. Marco bishops of Fermo and Faenza respectively. Popes Victor III and Urban II appointed their cardinals to the episcopal sees of Brescia (Herimanus) and Reggio-Emilia (Bonussenior). The practice was continued by successive popes, who named their cardinals particularly to the recently reestablished Latin archiepiscopal sees in southern Italy (Siponto, Brindisi, Salerno, Benevento). Also, three successive archbishops of Pisa: Uberto Rossi Lanfranchi (1133–1137/38), Balduino (1138–1145) and Villano Caetani (1146–1175) were initially the cardinals.|$|E

5|$|Gorman {{said that}} his Catholic {{grandmother}} had secretly married Albert Victor, and that his mother, as <b>the</b> <b>legitimate</b> daughter of Albert Victor, was the rightful heir to the throne. He claimed that the Ripper murders were staged {{as part of a}} conspiracy to hush up any potential scandal by murdering anyone who knew of the birth. In the original television series, the story is depicted as the belief of Gorman but not of the detectives. Captivated by Gorman's story, journalist Stephen Knight decided to investigate the claims further, and eventually published his research as the book Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution in 1976.|$|E
5|$|In 1518, in {{the absence}} of Adam Gordon, the castle was {{captured}} by Alexander Sutherland, <b>the</b> <b>legitimate</b> heir to the Earldom of Sutherland. The Gordons quickly retook the castle, captured Alexander and placed his head on a spear on top of the castle tower. Alexander's son John made an attempt on the castle in 1550, but was killed in the castle garden. During the more peaceful 17th century, the keep was extended {{with the addition of a}} large house, built around a courtyard to the south-west.|$|E

Korea, formerly under Japanese rule, was divided and occupied by the Soviet Union in the North and the US in the South between 1945 and 1948.

5|$|In late 1866, Napoleon {{tried to}} {{postpone}} the French departure, but the Americans had large numbers of troops on the north bank of the Rio Grande and Seward held firm.

In the meantime, Juárez, {{with the help of}} American military aid, was advancing through northeast Mexico. The French withdrew in early 1867, leaving Maximilian, who was soon captured by Juárez's troops. Although both the U.S. and France urged Juárez against it, the deposed emperor was executed by firing squad on June 19, 1867.|$|E
5|$|In the Roman empire's {{hierarchical}} system, a vassal king {{usage of}} the King of Kings title did not indicate {{that he is a}} peer of the emperor or that the vassalage ties were cut. The title was probably a challenge not to the Roman emperor but to Shapur I; Odaenathus was declaring that he, not the Persian monarch, was <b>the</b> <b>legitimate</b> King of Kings in the East. A lead token depicting Hairan I shows him wearing a crown shaped like that of the Parthian monarchs, so it must have been Odaenathus' crown; this combination of title and imagery indicate that Odaenathus considered himself the rival of the Sassanians and the protector of the region against them.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we argue}} the organic {{industry}} 2 ̆ 7 s move towards a more legal definition of organic production indicated {{a shift in}} <b>the</b> <b>legitimating</b> criteria in <b>the</b> organic agriculture institutional field, which can be observed through the analysis of <b>the</b> <b>legitimating</b> accounts of various actors. Prior to USDA certification, institutional actors in the organic food field largely relied upon the norms and values of its participants to maintain order. Legitimacy {{was based on the}} perception that a firm embodied a certain value set, which typically included opposition to large-scale commercial operations (DeLind, 2000; Drinkwater, 2009). To some, the introduction of federal standards signaled a replacement of the personal trust between consumer and producer, and an increased reliance on external policies mandated by federal certification (Guthman, 2000; 2004 a; 2004 b). This study explores the intricacies of the various actors 2 ̆ 7 legitimating accounts during this time of a shifting institutional field. Central questions include: how do these actors adapt their <b>legitimating</b> accounts to <b>the</b> changing context? Is there a discernible pattern to their rhetoric, not only over time, but also in relation to <b>the</b> other contemporary <b>legitimating</b> accounts? And finally, if patterns are evident, can they provide insight into <b>the</b> dynamics of <b>legitimating</b> sources in this institutional field...|$|R
