5|$|Because of the {{economic}} benefits of good telecommunication infrastructure, there is increasing worry about the inequitable access to telecommunication services amongst various countries of the world—this {{is known as the}} digital divide. A 2003 survey by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) revealed that roughly a third of countries have fewer <b>than</b> <b>one</b> mobile subscription for every 20 people and one-third of countries have fewer <b>than</b> <b>one</b> land-line telephone subscription for every 20 people. In terms of Internet access, roughly half of all countries have fewer <b>than</b> <b>one</b> out of 20 people with Internet access. From this information, as well as educational data, the ITU was able to compile an index that measures the overall ability of citizens to access and use information and communication technologies. Using this measure, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland received the highest ranking while the African countries Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Mali received the lowest.|$|E
