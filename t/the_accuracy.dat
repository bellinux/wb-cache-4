5|$|A {{challenge}} for future successful GWA {{study is to}} apply the findings {{in a way that}} accelerates drug and diagnostics development, including better integration of genetic studies into the drug-development process and a focus on the role of genetic variation in maintaining health as a blueprint for designing new drugs and diagnostics. Several studies have looked into the use of risk-SNP markers as a means of directly improving <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> of prognosis. Some have found that <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> of prognosis improves, while others report only minor benefits from this use. Generally, a problem with this direct approach is the small magnitudes of the effects observed. A small effect ultimately translates into a poor separation of cases and controls and thus only a small improvement of prognosis accuracy. An alternative application is therefore the potential for GWA studies to elucidate pathophysiology.|$|E

Similar to the results of the periodic pattern, in the environments with the growing workload pattern, <b>the</b> MLP prediction <b>accuracy</b> has a decreasing trend but does not change too much by increasing the window size. This is because increasing the window size of the MLP algorithm leads to the overfitting issue which decreases <b>the</b> MLP <b>accuracy.</b> As shown in Fig.  16, during the training phase <b>the</b> MLP <b>accuracy</b> increases by increasing the window size.
