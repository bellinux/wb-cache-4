At <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> alarm, Sydney Harbour was closed to external traffic, but Muirhead-Gould ordered ferries and other internal traffic to continue, as he believed that having multiple ships travelling around at speed would help force any submarines to remain submerged.|$|E

5|$|The Sociedad de Beneficencia (Society of Beneficence), {{a charity}} group {{made up of}} 87 society ladies, was {{responsible}} for most charity works in Buenos Aires prior to the election of Juan Perón. Fraser and Navarro write {{that at one point}} the Sociedad had been an enlightened institution, caring for orphans and homeless women, but that those days had long since passed by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> term of Juan Perón. In the 1800s, the Sociedad had been supported by private contributions, largely those of the husbands of the society ladies. But by the 1940s, the Sociedad was supported by the government.|$|E
5|$|The name of {{the cross}} is likely to derive {{from the village of}} Camuston. No trace of this village can be seen today, and it had ceased to exist by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> Ordnance Survey map, {{published}} in 1888, but surveyed in 1857 to 1859. Its former location is indicated in the 1794 map by Ainslie, about half a mile to the east of the cross. Camuston can be found with earlier spelling variations, for example, 'Cambistown' as it is called in documents from 1425 and 1426, and has a Celtic rather than Scandinavian etymology.|$|E
5|$|The wet {{season is}} the main period of {{vegetation}} growth within the Savanna climate regime. However, this also means that wet season {{is a time for}} food shortages before crops reach their full maturity. This causes seasonal weight changes for people in developing countries, with a drop occurring during the wet season until <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> harvest, when weights rebound. Malaria incidence increases during periods of high temperature and heavy rainfall.|$|E

5|$|Women's {{football}} {{became popular}} {{on a large}} scale at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> World War, when employment in heavy industry spurred the growth of the game, much as it had done for men fifty years earlier. The most successful team of the era was Dick, Kerr's Ladies of Preston, England. The team played in the first women's international matches in 1920, against a team from Paris, France, in April, and also made up most of the England team against a Scottish Ladies XI in 1920, and winning 22-0.|$|E
5|$|About <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{landing in}} 1969, {{it was decided}} to use an {{existing}} Saturn V to launch the Skylab orbital laboratory pre-built on the ground, replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several Saturn IB launches; this eliminated Apollo 20. NASA's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing, and NASA also had to make funds available {{for the development of the}} upcoming Space Shuttle. By 1971, the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19. The two unused Saturn Vs became museum exhibits at the John F. Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida, George C. Marshall Space Center in Huntsville, Alabama, Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.|$|E

5|$|After the {{destruction}} wreaked during the succession wars between Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II, Pompey restored {{the independence of}} Azotus, {{as he did with}} all Hellenising coastal cities (Antiquities Book 14, 4:4). A few years later, in 55 BCE, after more fighting, Roman general Gabinius helped rebuild Ashdod and several other cities left without protective walls (Antiquities Book 14, 5:2). In 30 BCE Ashdod came under the rule of King Herod, who then bequeathed it to his sister Salome (Antiquities Book 17, 8:1). By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> Jewish–Roman War (66-70), {{there must have been a}} large enough Jewish presence in Ashdod for Vespasian to feel compelled to place a garrison in the city.|$|E
5|$|As {{is common}} in {{frontier}} societies, the Southern Rhodesian settler community was mostly male: at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> World War, white females were outnumbered by males almost two to one. Because white women were so marriageable and cheap black labour was easily available to handle domestic duties, most female settlers did not work {{and spent most of}} their days supervising the household and family. The average white woman in the colony continued to live this kind of life during the war, in marked contrast to her British counterpart, who in many cases went to replace the male factory workers and farm labourers who went to war. In Rhodesia little of this sort occurred: there were no munitions factories, and the idea of women working down the country's mines was not considered practical. Some white farmers' wives took over management of the land in their husbands' absence, but this was quite unusual.|$|E
5|$|Completed {{in early}} 1883 and 1884, respectively, Dingyuan and Zhenyuan {{were to be}} sailed to China by a German crew, but delays—primarily from France {{following}} {{the outbreak of the}} Sino-French War in 1884—kept the ships in Germany. A German crew took Dingyuan out for a firing test at sea, causing glass to shatter around the ship, along with damage to a funnel. After the war ended in April 1885, the two ironclads were permitted to depart for China, along with Jiyuan. The three ships arrived in China in October and they were formally commissioned into the Beiyang Fleet. Dingyuan was the flagship of the new formation, and by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> Sino-Japanese War, she was under the command of Commodore Liu Pu-chan, while Admiral Ding Ruchang was also stationed on board. Zhenyuan was under the command of Captain Lin T'ai-tseng. With the war breaking out in 1894, both ships of the Dingyuan class first saw combat at the Battle of the Yalu River on 17 September.|$|E
