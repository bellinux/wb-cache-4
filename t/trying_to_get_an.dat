25|$|Prior to the {{formation}} of the Dallas Cowboys, there had not been an NFL team south of Washington, D.C. since the Dallas Texans folded in 1952. Oilman Clint Murchison Jr. had been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> NFL expansion team in Dallas (as was Lamar Hunt – who ended up with an AFL franchise), but George Preston Marshall, owner of the Washington Redskins, had a monopoly in the South.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major change}} made was that Lois {{did not fall}} in love with just Superman, {{although}} she was attracted to him. One reason was the revised nature of the Superman/Clark Kent relationship. In the original Silver Age stories, Superman had been the man who disguised himself as Clark Kent. In this newly revised concept, it was Clark Kent who lived a life in which his activity as Superman was decidedly secondary. Lois initially resented the rookie Clark Kent getting the story on Superman as his first piece when she had spent ages <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> interview. This sometimes ill-tempered rivalry remained the case until The Adventures of Superman #460–463 and Action Comics #650.|$|E
25|$|Prosecutors say {{it sends}} a message {{that no one is}} above the law, and the {{likelihood}} of being perp-walked after arrest deters criminal behavior on the part of offenders, especially white-collar criminals, who might otherwise believe they could successfully avoid conviction. Mary Jo White, former United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, the federal prosecutor's office that handles most crimes committed in the financial sector, believes perp walks in such cases restore investor confidence. Police say that the image of a suspect being taken into custody, when publicized, can encourage other witnesses to come forward with relevant information. Lastly, prosecutors may be <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> advantage in a bail hearing if they consider the defendant to be a flight risk, since it bolsters their case if the defendant apparently had to be arrested.|$|E

25|$|At this time, {{one of the}} post-An Lushan warlords (jiedushi), Wu Yuanji in Henan, {{had seized}} control of Zhangyi Circuit (centered in Zhumadian), an act for which he sought {{reconciliation}} with the imperial government, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> imperial pardon as a necessary prerequisite. Despite the intercession of influential friends, Wu was denied, thus officially putting him {{in the position of}} rebellion. Still seeking a pardon, Wu turned to assassination, blaming the Prime Minister, Wu Yuanheng, and other officials: the imperial court generally began by dawn, requiring the ministers to rise early in order to attend in a timely manner; and, on July 13, 815, before dawn, the Tang Prime Minister Wu Yuanheng was set to go to the palace for a meeting with Emperor Xianzong. As he left his house, arrows were fired at his retinue. His servants all fled, and the assassins seized Wu Yuanheng and his horse, and then decapitated him, taking his head with them. The assassins also attacked another official who favored the campaign against the rebellious warlords, Pei Du, but was unable to kill him. The people at the capital were shocked and there was turmoil, with officials refusing to leave their personal residences until after dawn.|$|E
500|$|Youkilis's error-less streak {{at the end}} of {{the regular}} season was 190 games; while he was charged with an error in the sixth inning of an October 16, 2007, playoff game against the Cleveland Indians, postseason games are not {{included}} in the record. Youkilis said, [...] "I'm not worried about making the error. I'm worried about trying to help the team win and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> out any way we can." [...] Leading the league with a perfect 1.000 fielding percentage, and an AL-record 1,079 error-less chances at first, Youkilis won the 2007 AL Gold Glove award for first basemen.|$|E
500|$|In 1985, Smith {{amassed a}} [...]276 batting average, 31 stolen bases, and 591 assists in the field. The Cardinals {{as a team}} won 101 games during the season and earned another postseason berth. Facing the Los Angeles Dodgers in the now best-of-seven NLCS, a split of the first four games {{set the stage for}} Game 5 at Busch Stadium. With the score tied at two runs apiece {{in the bottom of the}} ninth inning, Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda called upon closer Tom Niedenfuer to pitch. Smith batted left-handed against Niedenfuer with one out. Smith, who had never hit a home run in his {{previous}} 3,009 left-handed major league at-bats, pulled an inside fastball down the right-field line for a walk-off home run, ending Game 5 in a 3–2 Cardinals victory. Smith said, [...] "I was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> extra-base hit and get into scoring position. Fortunately, I was able to get the ball up." [...] The home run not only prompted broadcaster Jack Buck's [...] "Go crazy folks" [...] play-by-play call, but was also later voted the greatest moment in Busch Stadium history by Cardinals fans.|$|E
