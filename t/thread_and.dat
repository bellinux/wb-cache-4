5|$|Cylinder threads {{may be in}} {{two basic}} configurations: Taper <b>thread</b> <b>and</b> {{parallel}} thread. These thread specifications are detailed in a previous section. The valve thread specification must exactly match the neck thread specification of the cylinder. Improperly matched neck threads can fail under pressure and can have fatal consequences.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. To assist {{developing}} robust multithreaded software, {{we develop}} a thread monitoring system for multithreaded Java programs, which can trace or monitor running <b>threads</b> <b>and</b> synchronization. We design a monitoring system which has options to select interesting <b>threads</b> <b>and</b> synchronized actions. Using this tool, programmers can monitor only interesting <b>threads</b> <b>and</b> synchronization in more details by selecting options, and can detect a deadlock. It also provides profile information after execution, which summarizes behavior of running <b>threads</b> <b>and</b> synchronized actions during execution. We implement the {{system based on}} code inlining, and presents some experimental results...|$|R

5|$|A nucleus {{typically}} contains between 1 and 10 compact structures called Cajal bodies or coiled bodies (CB), whose diameter measures between 0.2µm and 2.0µm {{depending on}} the cell type and species. When seen under an electron microscope, they resemble balls of tangled <b>thread</b> <b>and</b> are dense foci of distribution for the protein coilin. CBs {{are involved in a}} number of different roles relating to RNA processing, specifically small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and small nuclear RNA (snRNA) maturation, and histone mRNA modification.|$|E
5|$|Both of the attendants– Dakini to {{her left}} and Varnini to her right– are {{depicted}} nude, with matted or dishevelled hair, three-eyed, full-breasted, wearing the serpentine sacred <b>thread</b> <b>and</b> the mundamala, and carrying the skull-bowl in the left hand and the knife in the right. Sometimes, the attendants also hold severed heads (not their own). While Dakini is fair, Varnini is red-complexioned. In other depictions, both are depicted blue-grey. Sometimes, her attendants are depicted as skeletons and drinking the dripping blood from Chhinnamasta's severed head, rather than her neck. The attendants are absent in some depictions.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the Actor model, {{concurrency}} {{was defined}} in low-level machine terms of <b>threads,</b> locks <b>and</b> buffers(channels).

However, there is no reason that the model could not be implemented directly in hardware without exposing any hardware <b>threads</b> <b>and</b> locks. Also, there is no necessary relationship between the number of Actors, <b>threads,</b> <b>and</b> locks that might be involved in a computation.

5|$|Messages, many in {{commonly}} used ciphers and encryption systems, {{have been found}} hidden in the video and its sound spectrogram, as well as images of tortured and mutilated people. Most of the messages have been decoded by participants in an ongoing Reddit <b>thread,</b> <b>and</b> the images sourced to notable murder investigations such as the Boston Strangler.

5|$|Chhinnamasta {{may have}} a lolling tongue. Her hair is loose and dishevelled and {{sometimes}} decorated with flowers. Alternately, in some images, her hair is tied. Additionally, she is described as having a third eye on her forehead and a jewel on her forehead, which is tied to a snake or a crown on the severed head. The crescent moon may also adorn her head. Chhinnamasta is depicted wearing a serpent as the sacred <b>thread</b> <b>and</b> a mundamala (garland of skulls or severed heads and bones), along with other various gold or pearl ornaments around her neck. Bangles and waist-belt ornaments may be also depicted. She may also wear a snake {{around her neck and}} serpentine earrings. Three streams of blood spring from her neck, one entering her own mouth, while the others are drunk by her female yogini companions, who flank her.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Portia have hunting tactics as {{versatile}} and adaptable as a lion's. All members of Portia have instinctive tactics for their most common prey, but can improvise {{by trial and error}} against unfamiliar prey or in unfamiliar situations, and then remember the new approach. They can also make detours to find the best attack angle against dangerous prey, even when the best detour takes a Portia out of visual contact with the prey, and sometimes the planned route leads to abseiling down a silk <b>thread</b> <b>and</b> biting the prey from behind. Such detours may take up to an hour, and a Portia usually picks the best route even if it needs to walk past an incorrect route. If a Portia makes a mistake while hunting another spider, it may itself be killed.|$|E

5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} may {{be manufactured}} from steel plate discs, which are cold {{drawn to a}} cylindrical cup form, {{in two or three}} stages, and generally have a domed base if intended for the scuba market, so they cannot stand up by themselves. After forming the base and side walls, the top of the cylinder is trimmed to length, heated and hot spun to form the shoulder and close the neck. This process thickens the material of the shoulder. The cylinder is heat-treated by quenching and tempering to provide the best strength and toughness. The cylinders are machined to provide the neck <b>thread</b> <b>and</b> o-ring seat (if applicable), then chemically cleaned or shot-blasted inside and out to remove mill-scale. After inspection and hydrostatic testing they are stamped with the required permanent markings, followed by external coating with a corrosion barrier paint or hot dip galvanising.|$|E
5|$|Another theory {{found in}} colonial-era texts {{such as one}} by John Murraya missionary in British India and Jainism scholar, states the main image carved in Cave5 {{is that of a}} Jaina figure. According to a third theory, by Henry Cousens and A.Sundaraarchaeologists, and {{supported}} by local legends, the statue is of an ancient king; in a photograph of the statue taken before its face was damaged, the figure lacked the Ushnisha lump that typically goes with Buddha's image. The statue has several unusual, non-Buddha ornaments such as rings for fingers, a necklace and a chest-band; it wears a Hindu Yajnopavita <b>thread</b> <b>and</b> its head is stylistically closer to a Jina head than a Buddha head. These features suggest the statue may be of a king represented with features of various traditions. According to Carol Radcliffe BolonAssistant Curator at the Smithsonian Freer Gallery of Art, the date and identity of the main statue in Cave5 remains enigmatic.|$|E
5|$|The {{large number}} of {{denominations}} issued in late-2008 {{as well as the}} suspension of paper supply by Giesecke & Devrient affected the Reserve Bank's ability to maintain the quality of the banknotes. Later denominations copied design features from the original 2007 banknote series and lacked many modern security features that banknotes of major currencies (such as the Canadian Dollar) relied on. The notes denominated from $20000 to $500000 and then from $10 million onwards used non-watermarked paper, whilst the $500 million notes were printed on pure cotton. A silhouette of the Zimbabwe Bird in Optically Variable Ink was used in such notes to compensate for this, but the iridescent strip was dropped for higher denominations. The $10000 and $1000000 notes reused paper for the $1000 notes (Pick no. 72), thereby carrying the embedded holographic <b>thread</b> <b>and</b> watermark. Two types of paper (regular and lined) were used on $20000, $50000 and $500000 banknotes.|$|E
