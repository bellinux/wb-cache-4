25|$|Trial judges {{typically}} take {{a passive}} role during trial; however, during their charge to the jury, judges may comment upon {{the value of}} certain testimony or suggest the appropriate amount of damages in a civil case, although {{they are required to}} <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> that it is to make its own decision and is not bound to agree with the judge.|$|E
25|$|On January 10, 2011, {{lawyers for}} Bonds filed {{additional}} papers asking the judge not to permit use of Anderson {{as a witness}} by the prosecution (since, given his previous unwillingness to testify, it was presumed he would again decline), nor to allow prosecutors to <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> about any refusal of Anderson to testify, nor permit use of a reported tape of Anderson talking to Steve Hoskins, previously a business manager of Bonds.|$|E
500|$|In February 2003, Thompson asked {{permission}} to file an amicus curiae (or [...] "friend of the court") brief in the Ohio case of Dustin Lynch, 16, who {{was charged with}} aggravated murder {{in the death of}} JoLynn Mishne; Lynch was [...] "obsessed" [...] with Grand Theft Auto III. When Judge John Lohn ruled that Lynch would be tried as an adult, Thompson passed a message from Mishne's father to the judge, asserting that [...] "the attorneys had better <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> about the violent video game that trained this kid [...] showed him how to kill our daughter, JoLynn. If they don't, I will." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{when that}} lawyer was done <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> {{what he was}} going to prove, he set down and begun to work his witnesses.|$|R
5000|$|During closing arguments, {{a deeply}} shaken Brigance <b>tells</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> {{to close their}} eyes and listen to a story. He describes, in slow and painful detail, the rape of a 10-year-old girl, recalling the story of Tonya's rape. He then asks <b>the</b> <b>jury,</b> in his final comment, to [...] "now imagine she's white." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{trial judge}} was also criticized for precluding the defense from {{presenting}} multiple pieces of exculpatory evidence, including testimony from experts regarding false confessions. Several risk factors {{were present in}} this case, including a history of mental illness, Rivera's mental state during the interrogation, and multiple interrogation techniques that are known to {{increase the likelihood of}} a false confession. <b>The</b> <b>jury</b> was also led to believe that Rivera failed a polygraph test. The defense was then precluded from <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>the</b> actual results, which were inconclusive.|$|R
500|$|As {{counsel for}} the prosecution, Hastings was the first {{barrister}} to speak. In his opening speech to the jury he criticised Booth for loving money rather than his country, saying {{that one of the}} things which the English prided themselves on was fair play, and [...] "no matter how loudly the defendant raises the cry of patriotism, I feel sure that your sense of fair play, gentlemen, will ensure a verdict that the defendant is unfit to sit in the House of Commons, as he has been guilty of fraud". Hastings then called Gruban to the witness stand, and asked him to <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> what had happened. Gruban described how Booth had claimed to have influence over David Lloyd George. Gruban was then cross-examined by Rigby Swift.|$|E
500|$|In {{an opening}} {{statement}} {{for the trial}} on May 4, Cisneros's defense denied her client's participation in the murder, and called Martínez a liar. They stated that Martínez and Garza orchestrated the murder without Cisneros's involvement. The prosecution told the jury that Cisneros orchestrated the murder. Fischer's mother took the stand and repeated her versions {{of the story and}} of the two loud noises she heard before finding her son's corpse covered with blood on the driveway. In addition to her, other witnesses took the stand to <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> their stories, including his stepfather and a gardener, who saw a vehicle with Mexican license plates leaving the house when Fischer was shot dead. Martínez testified in court again that Cisneros agreed to pay her to find someone to murder Fischer after Martínez told her that he was not in love with her daughter. Investigators who worked on the case also testified in court and stated that Martínez cooperated with them to set up a meeting with Cisneros after she assisted her in finding someone to have Fischer killed. The prosecution stated they had audio tapes of Martínez's meeting with Cisneros, but they were asked to hold off on presenting the evidence because the defense stated the tapes were tampered with. [...] The recordings were admitted to court on May 8 and presented to the jury through translated transcripts.|$|E
2500|$|Shafer v. South Carolina, [...] (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case {{decided in}} 2001. The case {{concerned}} {{the ability of}} a defendant to <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> that, absent a penalty of death, a penalty of life imprisonment would not permit early release of a prisoner on parole. While the question had been decided in the case of Simmons v. South Carolina, this case dealt with the extent of the ruling.|$|E

50|$|Hassan, who {{dismissed}} four {{defense attorneys}} and acted {{as his own}} lawyer during the trial, used his two-hour closing remarks <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> how he was a slave to his wife's rages. However, Hassan never produced any witnesses or evidence to that substantiated his abuse claims, while prosecutors cited numerous police reports filed by his wife and her medical records which testified to her being the battered spouse.|$|R
5000|$|A young signalman, Junius Urban, who {{was present}} on the bridge at the time Maryk took control, is called to testify about what happened. Urban {{provides}} a measure of comic relief, as he is poorly educated, extremely nervous, and confused about exactly what happened. His testimony <b>tells</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> very little, but on cross-examination he lets slip that Queeg was [...] "a nut" [...] on numerous small matters of discipline and tidiness.|$|R
2500|$|Later {{video game}} controversies {{centered}} on whether some murderers {{were inspired by}} crime simulators. In February 2003, 16-year-old American Dustin Lynch was charged with aggravated murder. He pleaded insanity in that he was obsessed with Grand Theft Auto III. Jack Thompson, an attorney and an opponent of video games, offered to represent Lynch. Thompson encouraged {{the father of the}} victim to pass a note to the judge that read [...] "the attorneys had better <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> about the violent video game that trained this kid [...] showed him how to kill our daughter, JoLynn. If they don't, I will." [...] Lynch later retracted his insanity plea. His mother, Jerrilyn Thomas, said, ...|$|E

5000|$|On {{the third}} day Jenkins shows <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> a picture of Morton's newborn grandson, saying the baby would be dead if not for Grogan. Cutter begins to show <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> Benning's wallet, {{containing}} pictures of his family that are stained with blood from his death, but says there has been too much [...] "heartbreaking testimony". Instead, he <b>tells</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> that <b>the</b> issue of abortion goes {{to the core of}} the human person, saying humans are united in the belief that every life is special and has dignity, which is why the violence of Grogan's act should be condemned. <b>The</b> <b>jury</b> finds Grogan guilty of first degree murder.|$|R
50|$|The {{indictment}} accused Curley and Schultz {{not only}} of failing to <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> police, but also of falsely <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> that McQueary never informed them of the alleged sexual activity.|$|R
2500|$|Leibowitz objected {{and moved}} {{for a new}} trial. Judge Horton refused to grant a new trial, <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> to [...] "put [...] out of your minds." [...] One author {{describes}} Wright's closing argument as [...] "the now-famous Jew-baiting summary to the jury." [...] He {{goes on to say}} that, [...] "Until Wright spoke, many of the newspapermen felt that there was an outside chance for acquittal, at least a hung jury. But ... From then on the defense was helpless." ...|$|R

60|$|No, I won't sit down. This ain't the 'ouse that {{a gentleman}} {{would sit down}} in. I'll be even with 'im yet. I'll <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> a pretty story. He deserves to be strung up, he does.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is a question, sir, {{that just}} at present I prefer to ask you. Now, sir, {{be good enough}} to <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury,</b> whence Mr. Tudor got that money; or tell them, if you dare do so, that you do not know.' ...|$|E
50|$|The coroner's former {{power to}} name {{a suspect in the}} inquest verdict and commit then for trial has been abolished. The coroner's verdict {{sometimes}} is persuasive for the police and Crown Prosecution Service, but normally proceedings in the coroner's court are suspended until after the final outcome of any criminal case is known. More usually, a coroner's verdict is also relied upon in civil proceedings and insurance claims. <b>The</b> coroner commonly <b>tells</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> which verdicts are lawfully available in a particular case.|$|R

50|$|Mrs. Lee was a loyal {{citizen of}} the United States whose flock of sheep was sold by the Confederate army, as the Confederates {{considered}} Mrs. Lee an 'alien enemy'. Mr. Knox purchased the sheep from the Confederate army, and Mrs. Lee brought suit for trespass and conversion. The Court instructed <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> that whatever amount they awarded could be paid with legal tender notes of the United States. Mr. Knox appealed, as he contended that this instruction was equivalent to <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> to add a premium for the discount of paper currency relative to specie.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{you mean}} to <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> is this: {{that you have no}} remembrance of signing twice on that special day, {{although}} you know that you have acted as witness on behalf of Sir Joseph Mason more than twice on the same day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{therefore}} {{there should}} be a lawyer to <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> what to do. They should have somebody up out of the parish to show that he is beside himself half his time. His wife would be the best person, only it would be hard lines on her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, Mr. Scott, {{have the}} {{goodness}} {{to look at}} the jury, and to speak a little louder.

5000|$|Grisham {{said the}} big case came in 1984, {{but it was}} not his case. As he was hanging around the court, he overheard a 12-year-old girl <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> what had {{happened}} to her. Her story intrigued Grisham, and he began watching the trial. He saw how the members of <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> cried as she told them about having been raped and beaten. It was then, Grisham later wrote in The New York Times, that a story was born. Musing over [...] "what would have happened if the girls father had murdered her assailants", Grisham took three years to complete his first book, A Time to Kill.|$|R
2500|$|In 1962, DeStefano {{was arrested}} after {{he tried to}} {{represent}} Vito Zaccagonini in a forgery trial in Rockford, Illinois. He later returned demanding {{the names of all}} employees in the state's attorney's and sheriff's offices so they could be called as witnesses at his subsequent trial. During another court date in Rockford, when he was serving as his own lawyer as was his practice, he confused everyone in the courtroom when he approached <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> and asked, [...] "Have you ever seen an elephant?" [...] Moments later DeStefano suddenly changed his plea to guilty, <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury,</b> [...] "something had come to light that I had not known before." [...] <b>The</b> <b>jury</b> found him guilty and fined him $100 for disorderly conduct.|$|R
500|$|The final day's {{proceedings}} {{were taken}} up by Davy, who produced more prosecution witnesses, and proceeded to pick apart the testimony of those {{who claimed to have}} seen Squires in Enfield Wash, in January. [...] He summarised the prosecution's case by <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> that Canning was guilty of [...] "the most impious and detestable [...] the human heart can conceive". [...] The recorder, William Moreton, stated the defence's case, and asked <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> to consider if they thought that Canning had answered the charges against her to their satisfaction, and if it was possible she could have survived for almost a month on [...] "no more than a quartern-loaf, and a pitcher of water".|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, you don't!' said Mr. Chaffanbrass, {{knocking}} his wig back, {{and coming}} {{well out of}} his kennel.

60|$|She was a thin, pale {{little woman}} with a nervous twitch {{on one side of}} her face, and the {{excitement}} through which she had just passed rendered her almost speechless; but she managed to <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> that Busby and Watson had fought and that she had warned her son not to run with Hart Busby.|$|E

"Now, {{you said}} some time ago, {{that when you}} first {{discovered}} that Captain Ussher {{had been killed by}} the prisoner, and that when you came to remember yourself, you weren't much surprised.

Can you <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> why you were not surprised at such an event as that?" ...|$|E
50|$|Keith is {{tried in}} Santa Loma. Merrick <b>tells</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> {{that he is}} sure Keith is not a killer, but all the {{evidence}} and witnesses are against him, and a guilty verdict is reached. Just before Keith is to be hanged, Merrick notices that the watch he found has an inscription to Dan. Confronted with the proof that he killed his own brother, Dan draws his revolver and grabs Ann as a shield. When his father approaches, Dan kills him and tries to flee on horseback, but is shot in the back, just like his brother, by Merrick.|$|R
60|$|It {{remained}} {{for the judge}} to sweep away the defence, or to favor the prisoners by countenancing it. Fortunately for them, {{he was an old}} man; and could recall, not without regret, a time when the memory of Cribb and Molyneux was yet green. He began his summing-up by <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> that <b>the</b> police had failed to prove that the fight was a prize-fight. After that, the public, by indulging in roars of laughter whenever they could find a pretext for doing so without being turned out of court, showed that they had ceased to regard the trial seriously.|$|R
50|$|On 24 April 2014, the Court of Final Appeal {{refused to}} allow an appeal against the verdict of her 2011 retrial, rejecting the {{arguments}} of Kissel's lawyer, Edward Fitzgerald, that the prosecution was wrong to <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> retrial's <b>jury</b> that his client was not suffering any psychiatric illness and that the trial judge had erred in directing <b>the</b> <b>jury.</b>|$|R
