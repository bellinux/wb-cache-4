5|$|Sheriff Tate {{arrives and}} discovers that Bob Ewell has {{died during the}} fight. The sheriff argues with Atticus about the {{prudence}} and ethics of charging Jem (whom Atticus believes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>responsible)</b> or Boo (whom Tate believes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>responsible).</b> Atticus eventually accepts the sheriff's story that Ewell simply fell on his own knife. Boo asks Scout to walk him home, and after she says goodbye to him at his front door he disappears again. While standing on the Radley porch, Scout imagines life from Boo's perspective, and regrets {{that they had never}} repaid him for the gifts he had given them.|$|E

5|$|It is {{suspected}} that comet impacts have, over long timescales, also delivered significant quantities {{of water to}} the Earth's Moon, {{some of which may}} have survived as lunar ice. Comet and meteoroid impacts are also thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> for the existence of tektites and australites.|$|E

5|$|Spotted hyenas {{have also}} been found to catch fish, tortoises, humans, black rhino, hippo calves, young African elephants, {{pangolins}} and pythons. There {{is at least one}} record of four hyenas killing an adult or subadult hippopotamus in Kruger National Park. The fossil record indicates that the now extinct European spotted hyenas primarily fed on Przewalski's horses, Irish elk, reindeer, red deer, roe deer, fallow deer, wild boar, ibex, steppe wisent, aurochs, and woolly rhinoceros. Spotted hyenas are thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> for the dis-articulation and destruction of some cave bear skeletons. Such large carcasses were an optimal food resource for hyenas, especially at the end of winter, when food was scarce. Spotted hyenas may consume leather articles such as boots and belts around campsites. Jane Goodall recorded spotted hyenas attacking or savagely playing with the exterior and interior fittings of cars, and the species is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> for eating car tyres.|$|E
5|$|The Social Credit Board {{comprised}} five backbenchers. Insurgent Glenville MacLachlan was chair, and Aberhart loyalist Floyd Baker was secretary. The {{other three}} members were insurgents Selmer Berg, James L. McPherson, and William E. Hayes. The Board was empowered {{to appoint a}} commission of between three and five experts to implement social credit; the commission was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> to the Board.|$|E
5|$|The active atmospheres and {{closeness}} of these stars {{means that they}} are among the brightest x-ray sources in the sky. However the x-ray emission is due to stable coronal structures and not eruptive flaring activity. Coronal loops larger than the Sun and with temperatures of several million K are likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> {{for the majority of the}} x-rays.|$|E

5|$|Venom in {{snakes and}} some lizards {{is a form}} of saliva that has been {{modified}} into venom over its evolutionary history. In snakes, venom has evolved to kill or subdue prey, as well as to perform other diet-related functions. The evolution of venom is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> for the enormous expansion of snakes across the globe.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{reported}} an age-related decline in dopamine synthesis and dopamine receptor density (i.e., the number of receptors) in the brain. This decline has been shown to occur in the striatum and extrastriatal regions.C]DOPA |journal=Life Sciences |volume=79 |issue=8 |pages=730–736 |doi=10.1016/j.lfs.2006.02.017 |pmid=16580023 }} Decreases in the D1, D2, and D3 receptors are well documented. The reduction of dopamine with aging is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> for many neurological symptoms that increase in frequency with age, such as decreased arm swing and increased rigidity. Changes in dopamine levels may also cause age-related changes in cognitive flexibility.|$|E

5|$|Although the Poor Law Amendment Act did not ban {{all forms}} of outdoor relief, it stated that no able-bodied person was to receive money or other help from the Poor Law {{authorities}} except in a workhouse. Conditions in workhouses were to be made harsh to discourage people from claiming. Workhouses were {{to be built in}} every parish and, if parishes were too small, parishes could group together to form Workhouse Unions. The Poor Law Commissioners were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> for overseeing the implementation of the Act.|$|E
5|$|Astronomically, {{the most}} {{important}} property of compact objects is that they provide a supremely efficient mechanism for converting gravitational energy into electromagnetic radiation. Accretion, the falling of dust or gaseous matter onto stellar or supermassive black holes, is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> for some spectacularly luminous astronomical objects, notably diverse kinds of active galactic nuclei on galactic scales and stellar-size objects such as microquasars. In particular, accretion can lead to relativistic jets, focused beams of highly energetic particles that are being flung into space at almost light speed.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the climate}} and land of Palestine, {{where most of the}} Bible takes place, were well-suited to growing grapes, and the wine that the {{vineyards}} produced was a valued commodity in ancient times, both for local consumption and for its value in trade. Trade with Egypt was quite extensive. Jews were a wine-drinking culture well before the foundation of Rome. Vintage wines were found in the tomb of King Scorpion in Hierakonpolis. Archaeological evidence suggests that Semitic predecessors were thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> for the vintages that were found in the tomb. Vineyards were protected from robbers and animals by walls, hedges, and manned watchtowers.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though the}} miners {{were able to}} reach a {{settlement}} in early 1990, the case of the UMWA vs. Pittston Coal Company did not end in 1990. The fines, over $60 million, did not come into bargaining until 1994 and Pittston agreed to drop most of the charges. However, since the case was now in the court system, many courts wanted the UMWA <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> for all of the fines. The UMWA appealed all fines against them and the case remained undecided for many years.|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have had}} a long history of contact with humans, but most of it has been to the {{detriment}} of fisher populations. Unprovoked attacks on humans are extremely rare, but fishers will attack if they feel threatened or cornered. In one case, a fisher was blamed for an attack on a six-year-old boy. In another case, a fisher is believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> for an attack on a twelve-year-old boy.|$|E
