5|$|Shilts {{focuses on}} several {{organizations}} and communities that were either hit hardest by AIDS—and {{were given the}} task of finding {{the cause of the}} disease—or begging the government for money to fund research and provide social services to people who were dying. He often uses an omniscient point of view to portray individuals' <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> <b>feelings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Written over {{a period}} of several years and {{influenced}} by European literature, Siti Akbari differs from earlier syairs in its use of suspense and emphasis on prose rather than form. It also incorporates European realist views to expand upon the genre, although it maintains several of the hallmarks of traditional syairs. Critical views have emphasised various aspects of its story, finding in the work an increased empathy for women's <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> <b>feelings,</b> a call for a unifying language in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), and a polemic regarding the relation between tradition and modernity.|$|E
5|$|Kochanowski {{was born}} in 1530 into a prosperous noble family. In his youth he studied at the {{universities}} of Kraków, Königsberg and Padua and traveled extensively in Europe. He worked for a time as a royal secretary, and then settled {{in the village of}} Czarnolas, a part of his family inheritance. Kochanowski's multifaceted creative output is remarkable for both the depth of <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> <b>feelings</b> that he shares with the reader, and for its beauty and classic perfection of form. Among Kochanowski's best known works are bucolic Frascas (trifles), epic poetry, religious lyrics, drama-tragedy The Dismissal of the Greek Envoys, and the most highly regarded Threnodies or laments, written {{after the death of his}} young daughter.|$|E

5|$|In {{the ensuing}} battle {{to save the}} planet, several Halos are able to escape, their own AIs {{enacting}} failsafe protocols. Bornstellar manages to escape {{with the help of}} a young council member and a guard. They escape through the same portal as the Halos but lose power and drift for an unknown amount of time before being recovered by Lifeworkers. The portal has carried them to the Ark, the massive structure that serves as a construction site for Halos and also a haven for the Librarian's work. The trio are healed, and Bornstellar meets the Librarian, which brings up conflicting <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> <b>feelings,</b> due to his imprint from the Didact. She informs him that the Master Builder executed the Didact soon after Bornstellar was sent back to his family. With the news that the Didact is gone, Bornstellar resolves to take his place. The book ends with a narration from the Didact/Bornstellar, revealing that the escaped prisoner was the last Precursor, known as Timeless One. Through a conversation the Didact had long ago, it is learned that the Precursors created the Forerunners, only for the Forerunners to rise up and eradicate the Precursors, except this one, who now seeks revenge.|$|E
25|$|Freud {{hoped that}} his {{research}} {{would provide a}} solid scientific basis for his therapeutic technique. The goal of Freudian therapy, or psychoanalysis, was to bring repressed <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> <b>feelings</b> into consciousness in order to free the patient from suffering repetitive distorted emotions.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, {{the lyric}} {{emerged as the}} {{principal}} poetic form of the 19th century and {{came to be seen}} as synonymous with poetry. Romantic lyric poetry consisted of first-person accounts of the <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> <b>feelings</b> of a specific moment; the feelings were extreme but personal.|$|E
50|$|Bovee wrote {{two books}} that were widely quoted in {{contemporaneous}} compilations, these being Intuitions <b>and</b> Summaries of <b>Thought</b> <b>and</b> <b>Thoughts,</b> <b>Feelings</b> <b>and</b> Fancies.|$|R

5000|$|Hamartia is {{sometimes}} employed to mean acts of sin [...] "by omission or commission in <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeling</b> or in speech and actions" [...] as in Romans 5:12, [...] "all have sinned".|$|R
25|$|Affective {{disorders}} {{have long}} been recognised as a complication of AAS use. Case reports describe both hypomania and mania, along with irritability, elation, recklessness, racing <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> <b>feelings</b> of power and invincibility that {{did not meet the}} criteria for mania/hypomania. Of 53 bodybuilders who used AAS, 27 (51%) reported unspecified mood disturbance.|$|E
25|$|Another {{relevant}} {{skill is}} called empathic accuracy, which {{is defined as}} the “ability to accurately infer the specific content of another person’s <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> <b>feelings</b> (Ickes, 1993, p.588). For example, caregivers higher on empathic accuracy tend to provide more instrumental support and less negative support (e.g., accusing or criticizing) to their spouse.|$|E
25|$|Primal therapy lacks protocol. In a usual setting between {{psychologist}} and client, a “believed cause” of certain painful <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> <b>feelings</b> {{from the past}} are generally addressed {{as a means to}} find amends to the root of the problem. Professionals that practice this therapy do not address such causes which calls its legitimacy into question.|$|E
60|$|So down I went, {{though with}} anger in my heart, for be it remembered that I, the modern Allan Quatermain, knew every <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeling</b> that {{passed through the}} mind of my prototype.|$|R
60|$|Letitia and Grace, as {{two older}} sisters of families, had a {{peculiar}} intimacy, and discussed every thing together, from {{the mode of}} clearing jelly up to the profoundest problems of science and morals. They were both charming, well-mannered, well-educated, well-read women, and trusted each other to the uttermost with every <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>and</b> purpose of their hearts.|$|R

25|$|Continuing {{into the}} 1990s, discussions were further {{developed}} on {{the roles that}} philosophy and science had in understanding animal cognition and mentality. In subsequent years, it was argued there was {{strong support for the}} suggestion that some animals (most likely amniotes) have at least simple conscious <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> <b>feelings</b> and that the view animals feel pain differently to humans is now a minority view.|$|E
25|$|Haley {{conducted}} {{the first interview}} for Playboy magazine. His interview with jazz musician Miles Davis appeared in the September 1962 issue. Haley elicited candid comments from Davis about his <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> <b>feelings</b> on racism. That interview {{set the tone for}} what became a significant feature of the magazine. Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Playboy Interview with Haley was the longest he ever granted to any publication.|$|E
25|$|The visual {{nature of}} dreams is {{generally}} highly phantasmagoric; that is, different locations and objects continuously blend into each other. The visuals (including locations, characters/people, objects/artifacts) are generally reflective of a person's memories and experiences, but conversation {{can take on}} highly exaggerated and bizarre forms. Some dreams may even tell elaborate stories wherein the dreamer enters entirely new, complex worlds and awakes with ideas, <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> <b>feelings</b> never experienced prior to the dream.|$|E
6000|$|Much of old <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeling</b> {{was then}} <b>and</b> there taken up again, {{and it was}} on one of the last evenings of the visit that Mr. Mohun, walking up and down the alley with Lady Merrifield, said-- ...|$|R
60|$|I {{had moved}} to the fire, and she stood opposite, and gazed into me; and as she gazed, her face became {{gradually}} more and more expressive of <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeling,</b> till at last a dimness quenched her clear vision.|$|R
6000|$|... *** Readers, it is hoped, will {{remember}} that, by his Ode at the Harvard Commemoration, the author had precluded himself {{from many of}} the natural outlets of <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeling</b> common to such occasions as are celebrated in these poems.|$|R
25|$|Personality tests – Tests of {{personality}} aim to describe patterns of behavior, <b>thoughts,</b> <b>and</b> <b>feelings.</b> They generally fall within two categories: objective and projective. Objective measures, {{such as the}} MMPI, are based on restricted answers—such as yes/no, true/false, or a rating scale—which allow for computation of scores that {{can be compared to}} a normative group. Projective tests, such as the Rorschach inkblot test, allow for open-ended answers, often based on ambiguous stimuli, presumably revealing non-conscious psychological dynamics.|$|E
25|$|Isabella Linton: Isabella is {{seen only}} in {{relation}} to other characters, although some insight into her <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> <b>feelings</b> is provided by the chapter, a long letter to Ellen, detailing her arrival at Wuthering Heights after her marriage to Heathcliff. She views Heathcliff romantically, despite Catherine's warnings, and becomes an unwitting participant in his plot for revenge against Edgar. Heathcliff marries her, but treats her abusively. While pregnant, she escapes to London and gives birth to a son, Linton.|$|E
25|$|One study, of first-year {{students}} {{in medical school}} writing in dialogue journals with their professors, found that the interactive journal writing “provided {{a safe place for}} students to describe their experiences and relationships and to question their own values and beliefs.” The process of writing in this way with their teachers broke down barriers between them, through a mutual sharing of <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> <b>feelings,</b> which led to enhanced rapport and communication, and thus facilitated students’ personal and reflective perspectives and initiated and encouraged self-awareness.|$|E
5000|$|In 1998 Zukav {{began an}} ongoing {{conversation}} with Oprah Winfrey, appearing on her television show 35 times - {{more than any}} other guest. Oprah, who keeps a copy of The Seat of the Soul at her bedside, proclaimed: [...] "The Seat of the Soul is my favorite book of all time, except for the Bible." [...] Her favorite quote from The Seat of the Soul: [...] "Every action, <b>thought,</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeling</b> is motivated by an intention, and that intention is a cause that exists as one with an effect.... In this most profound way, we are held responsible for every action, <b>thought,</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeling,</b> which is to say, for our every intention." ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Andrew Marvell's poetry shows all {{the qualities}} of metaphysical poetry having the {{characteristics}} of complexity, intellectual tone, abundance of subtle wit, fusion of <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeling,</b> colloquial argumentative tone, witty and fantastic conceits, scholarly allusions, dramatic tone and philosophic or reflective element...|$|R
50|$|The plays end brings {{all these}} dichotomous themes together, showing that while things {{may appear to}} {{contradict}} — Romanticism and Classicism, intuition <b>and</b> logic, <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeling</b> — they can exist, paradoxically, {{in the same time}} and space. Order is found amid the chaos.|$|R
25|$|May Fourth radicalism, {{combined}} {{with changes in}} the education system, made possible {{the emergence of a}} large group of women writers. While there had been women writers in the late imperial period and the late Qing, they had been few in number. These writers generally tackled domestic issues, such as relations between the sexes, family, and friendship, but they were revolutionary in giving direct expression to female subjectivity. Ding Ling's story Miss Sophia's Diary exposes the <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> <b>feelings</b> of its female diarist in all their complexity.|$|E
25|$|Research has {{identified}} {{a number of}} OA practices significantly correlating with maintaining abstinence in OA: adherence to a food plan (including weighing and measuring food), communication with other members (specifically sponsors), spending time in prayer and meditation, performing service work, completing the fourth step, completing the ninth step, writing down <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> <b>feelings,</b> attending meetings, reading OA/AA literature, and the educational status of the participant. Researchers have therefore concluded that application of OA practices might directly help promote abstinence and reduce the frequency of relapse in those with binge eating disorder and bulimia nervosa.|$|E
25|$|According to Vega, she {{particularly}} liked singing {{because it}} is through this medium that {{she is able to}} best express her inner <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> <b>feelings.</b> This became especially true after the loss of her brother Joey, to whom she was particularly very close. Joey was stabbed to death in a car by hired killers, who mistook him for another person they were hired to look for and then kill, while hanging out with his friends in 1983. His untimely death at the age of 22 proved to be devastating for the young Julie, who then repeatedly wished to join him in death.|$|E
60|$|She {{drew him}} to the light and looked with strange, {{piercing}} intentness into his face. Gale had never dreamed a woman's eyes could hold such a world of <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeling.</b> It seemed all the sweetness of life was there, and all the pain.|$|R

"The view of Jerusalem never becomes familiar," [...] {{said the}} Syrian, [...] "for its {{associations}} are so transcendent, so various, so inexhaustible, {{that the mind}} can never anticipate its course of <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeling,</b> when one sits, as we do now, on this immortal mount." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The recent election," [...] Bromfield remarked, [...] "demonstrated {{a number}} of things, {{not the least of}} them being the extreme {{remoteness}} of the 'egghead' from the <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeling</b> of the whole of the people" [...] (Anti-Intellectualism in American Life York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1963, pp. 9-10).|$|R
