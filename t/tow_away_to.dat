50|$|The 1980 {{season was}} her last, {{although}} she did star in the film Chariots of Fire and took the 150th anniversary cruise around the Island. 27 August saw her final passenger sailing from Douglas to Llandudno. She was <b>towed</b> <b>away</b> <b>to</b> Dutch breakers on 30 October 1980.|$|R
5000|$|After the Expo was over, {{the site}} became Okinawa Commemorative National Government Park (国営沖縄記念公園), {{also known as}} Ocean Expo Park. Most of the {{exhibits}} were removed, although the Aquapolis was retained as an attraction and eventually hosted four million visitors. As years passed, {{the number of visitors}} to the Aquapolis declined and it was closed in 1993. In October 2000, the Aquapolis was <b>towed</b> <b>away</b> <b>to</b> Shanghai to be scrapped.|$|R
50|$|One day, Patrolman Gagancho parks his jeep {{in front}} of a fire hydrant, which is not allowed. While his back is turned, his jeep is <b>towed</b> <b>away</b> <b>to</b> a place called Radium in the suburb of San Andres Bukid. When the tow truck leaves the jeep there, some scrupulous men take the jeep apart, leaving only its chassis.|$|R
50|$|Juno {{was taken}} out of service in 2007, and laid up at Rosneath until she was {{dismantled}} there in 2011. In October 2010, Saturn took over the Dunoon sailings from older sister Jupiter, which was laid up at Rosneath as spare vessel for that winter, although she never saw service again, and on 25 June 2011 she was <b>towed</b> <b>away</b> <b>to</b> be broken up in Denmark.|$|R
50|$|In early 2010, Exeter {{was used}} {{to assist with the}} {{training}} of new naval base tugs. She was put up for sale by auction on 28 March 2011 and finally <b>towed</b> <b>away</b> <b>to</b> be scrapped at Leyal Ship Recycling in Turkey on 23 September 2011, provoking some criticism from former crew members who were upset that the Ministry of Defence had apparently failed to inform them of the ship's fate.|$|R
5|$|On 9 October, Banksy {{unveiled}} one of {{the more}} elaborate and politically strong pieces of the series. It featured armed soldiers and horses spray-painted on a car and trailer in an empty lot in the Lower East Side. Instead of commentary about the work, the accompanying audio was that of a classified video from the July 12, 2007 Baghdad airstrike. After being dismantled, the car was <b>towed</b> <b>away</b> <b>to</b> prevent further defacement.|$|R
50|$|In October 2011 the Government of Montenegro {{adopted a}} {{document}} {{in which it}} was stated that attempts at selling the ship as a complete warship will stop, and it would instead be sold for scrap. Before the scrapping took place, weapons systems, radio communication and other electrical equipment as well as two MTU 8V396 diesel generators that were installed in 1997 and 1999, were removed from the ship. On 19 August 2013 Split was <b>towed</b> <b>away</b> <b>to</b> a ship breaking yard in Durrës after being sold to an Albanian company for 400.000 euros.|$|R
50|$|While both ships served {{extensively}} {{in the first few}} years of World War II, it was Exeter that had the more notable career. Most famously, Exeter took part in the Battle of the River Plate against the German raider , and was badly damaged, though later she was repaired and modernized. She escorted a convoy to the Pacific in late 1941, and was again heavily damaged in the Battle of the Java Sea, then caught and overwhelmed a few days later by four Japanese heavy cruisers. York was sunk in Suda Bay, Crete, by Italian MT boats in 1941, and was raised in 1952 and <b>towed</b> <b>away</b> <b>to</b> be scrapped in Italy.|$|R

50|$|She was {{lengthened}} to 425 feet m in 1942 {{when she}} was retro-fitted with self-unloading machinery. In 1948 she was renamed the Detroit Edison, after the firm which was her primary client, and another vessel assumed the name Adam E. Cornelius. In 1954, she was renamed George F. Rand. In 1962 she was purchased by the Reoch Steamship Company, which renamed her the Avondale and was registered in Hamilton, Bermuda. In 1974 Reoch Steamship Company was reorganized as Westdale Shipping Company. The Westdale Shipping Company had moored the vessel in Port Colborne, Ontario, in 1975 after the hull was condemned. Sold to Marine Salvage Ltd. {{and it was there}} that she caught fire in 1978, set by vandals. In 1979 the hulk was <b>towed</b> <b>away</b> <b>to</b> Spain and scrapped.|$|R
50|$|Calypso had a less eventful {{and shorter}} naval career than Calliope, but {{spent more time}} at sea. As part of the sail {{training}} squadron, Calypso cruised in home waters, the North Sea, and the Arctic and Atlantic oceans. In 1902, after that service ended, the ship {{was sent to the}} colony of Newfoundland, and served there as a stationary training vessel for the Newfoundland Royal Naval Reserve before and during the First World War. In 1922 the vessel was declared surplus and sold out of the service, and thereafter used as a storage hulk in Lewisporte. The Calypso Foundation, a local charity engaged in training the developmentally disabled, was named after the old training ship. The ship's hull was <b>towed</b> <b>away</b> <b>to</b> a coastal bay and burned out. It is still there, awash in the waters of the Atlantic Ocean.|$|R
50|$|Following 29 Antarctic and 10 Arctic deployments, Glacier was {{decommissioned}} in 1987. She {{went under}} the control of the U.S. Maritime Administration, located in the U.S. Naval Reserve Fleet, Suisun Bay, on the Sacramento River, California. The Glacier Society saved Glacier from the scrapyard in 2000, and planned to convert the ship into a hospital or research vessel. However, on 16 February 2012 Glacier was sold for $146,726 to be broken up by ESCO Marine in Brownsville, Texas. Efforts to save the vessel from the breakers continued as the ship was taken to the former Naval base at Mare Island, Vallejo, on 17 April 2012 for cleaning. Nevertheless, she was <b>towed</b> <b>away</b> <b>to</b> Brownsville, arriving on 19 June. A last-minute stay of execution was rejected, and MARAD ordered her scrapping to begin on 2 July 2012.|$|R
50|$|In 1866 a 43-year-old frigate, HMS Hamadryad, was towed from Dartmouth to Cardiff {{and fitted}} {{out as a}} {{hospital}} ship {{at a cost of}} £2,791. The town's Medical Officer of Health, Dr Henry Paine, had identified the need for a seamen's hospital because of the many diseases that were brought to the docks by sailors from overseas. A piece of waste ground in Cardiff Docks known as Rat Island was donated by the Marquis of Bute and the hospital ship opened for patients in November 1866. In its first year it admitted 400 patients and the free treatment was funded by a levy of two shillings per hundred tons of shipping at Cardiff Docks. The hospital ship was to remain at this site until 1905, when a permanent hospital was opened. Hamadryad was refloated and <b>towed</b> <b>away</b> <b>to</b> be scrapped.|$|R
6000|$|... "As the two fleets separated, {{drifting}} {{apart as}} it would almost seem, so few were the sails now set, we rowed up among them, and for hours were occupied in picking up men clinging to broken spars and wreckage, for but few of the ships had {{so much as a}} single boat left. We were fortunate enough to save well-nigh a hundred, of whom more than seventy were our own men, the remainder Dutch. From these last we learnt that the ships of Van Tromp and Ruyter had both been so disabled that they had been forced to fall out of battle, and had been <b>towed</b> <b>away</b> <b>to</b> port. They said that their Admirals Cornelius Evertz and Van der Hulst had both been killed, while on our side we learnt that Admiral Sir Christopher Mings had fallen." ...|$|R

5000|$|The Radio Caroline ships {{announced}} they {{would move to}} Holland, with an advertising office in New York City. The reality was felt in early 1968 when two tugs representing the supply company <b>towed</b> the vessels <b>away</b> <b>to</b> satisfy debts.|$|R
50|$|Human {{casualties}} were low, {{but there was}} a major hit on the Argentine vessel ARA Bahía Buen Suceso, which happened to be moored at Fox Bay East {{at the time of the}} first British Harrier raid. Bahía Buen Suceso was a 5,000-ton fleet transport that was serving as a logistic ship, intended to resupply the scattered Argentine garrisons around the islands. The ship was attacked by two BAe Sea Harrier FRS.Mk.1s (XZ500 and ZA191) from HMS Hermes. Because it was so close to houses, the Harriers used their 30 mm ADEN cannons rather than general-purpose bombs. They succeeded in damaging the ship's bridge and engine room, and also setting fire to a paint store and workshop ashore. One of the Harriers was hit in the tail by a 7.62 mm calibre bullet while strafing the transport, though the aircraft was able to return to Hermes safely. In a storm during the conflict she partially tore loose from her moorings and the bow swung on to the beach. Once the war ended, she was <b>towed</b> <b>away</b> <b>to</b> San Carlos Water by the tug Irishman.|$|R

This earned Lt Cdr Biermann the Order of the British Empire, an honour he shared with the entire ship's company ...|$|R
2500|$|Despite these preparations, {{the fire}} ship was now so damaged that she seemed likely to sink before {{she reached the}} Real Felipe. A Spanish launch was also {{approaching}} Anne Galley {{with the intention of}} <b>towing</b> her <b>away.</b> <b>To</b> prevent this, Mackie went below and opened fire on the launch with his waist guns to no avail. Eventually, Real Felipes gunfire hit Anne Galleys bows and ignited the loose gunpowder scattered about the fire ship's hold. Other authors reported that the gunpowder was ignited by Mackie's own guns recoil. Anne Galley promptly exploded, killing Mackie and all others aboard. According to one observer she was [...] "within her own length", or roughly , from the disabled Real Felipe when she sank.|$|R
50|$|It was {{initially}} hoped by {{officials with the}} provincial government that Transport Canada {{would pay for the}} removal of MV Miner, since the tow was operating under federal shipping regulations {{at the time of the}} grounding. The Government of Canada denied any responsibility in paying for cleanup costs of the provincial wildlife management area, which were initially estimated to be at least $5 million CAD. Only weeks later, the Government of Nova Scotia estimated that if the wreck could not be <b>towed</b> <b>away,</b> and had <b>to</b> be taken apart on-site, costs could rise as high as $25 million CAD.|$|R

5000|$|Many ships {{have been}} wrecked at Prawle Point, {{the most recent}} being in December, 1992, when the ship Demetrios, {{formerly}} the Long Lin from China was being towed by a tug from Dunkirk to a Mediterranean scrapyard. During terrible gales in the English Channel, the tow broke and the Demetrios drifted helplessly. The ship struck the rocks at Prawle Point on 18 December, breaking her {{back in a few}} hours. The wreck attracted huge crowds for many weeks, and eventually a local salvage company cut up the ship and <b>towed</b> <b>away</b> the remains <b>to</b> Plymouth. However, the cost of scrapping the ship sent them into liquidation. Some remains were, however left over and are still visible today.|$|R
50|$|Simón Fischer (Ricardo Darín), a {{demolition}} expert, {{picks up}} a cake for his daughter's birthday party and discovers his car has been <b>towed</b> <b>away.</b> He goes <b>to</b> the towed-car lot and argues, insisting there were no yellow lines indicating no parking, but to no avail. He grudgingly pays the towing fee and misses his daughter's party. The next day, when he is again refused a refund now at DMV, he attacks the glass partition and is arrested. The story makes the news and Fischer's company fires him. His wife (Nancy Dupláa) seeks a divorce and sole custody of their daughter. Fischer applies unsuccessfully for a job and discovers his car has been towed again. He retrieves the car and packs it with explosives in a tow zone. After it is towed again, he detonates the explosives, destroying the towing office with no casualties. Fischer is imprisoned and becomes a local hero, with calls on social media for his release. His wife and daughter visit him in prison for his birthday, bringing him a cake {{in the form of}} a tow truck.|$|R

5000|$|In [...] "Tow-Line Goes Haywire", one of Tow-Line's first acts on {{arriving}} on Earth was to tow Side Burn, {{much to the}} latter's disgust. Under Prowl's supervision, Tow-Line began <b>towing</b> <b>away</b> Metro City's illegal parkers. Unfortunately his zealousness extended <b>to</b> <b>towing</b> <b>away</b> tricycles, wedding cars, mailmen named Moe, and so on, leading Prowl to reprimand him. Tow-Line's work {{was not lost on}} the Predacons, who ambushed him and dragged him <b>away</b> <b>to</b> do a bit of reprogramming with a disk. Soon Tow-Line considered the other Autobots as villains and began towing X-Brawn. After reasoning failed, X-Brawn attempted to use his grappling hook, causing damage to the other Autobot's circuits, and resulting in Tow-Line dumping him down a hole at the power plant. Side Burn was also captured easily, but while carrying Rapid Run through the city, Tow-Line was spotted by Prowl and Koji. Intercepted by Optimus Prime and Prowl, he was soon rescued from the disk's control and apologized profusely for kidnapping his fellow Autobots. Even after learning his lesson, Tow-Line still cheerfully hauled off Prowl for parking illegally.|$|R
