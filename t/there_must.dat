5|$|A group {{consists}} {{of a set of}} elements and a single operation which combines a first and a second element and returns a third. The operation must satisfy certain constraints for it to determine a group: It must be closed (when applied to any pair of elements of the associated set, the generated element must also be a member of that set), it must be associative, <b>there</b> <b>must</b> be an identity element (an element which, when combined with another element using the operation, results in the original element, such as adding zero to a number or multiplying it by one), and for every element <b>there</b> <b>must</b> be an inverse element.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{requirement}} that <b>there</b> <b>must</b> be at least eight SMCs, {{the total number of}} SMCs and GRCs in Singapore and their boundaries are not fixed. The number of electoral divisions and their names and boundaries are specified by the Prime Minister from time to time by notification in the Government Gazette.|$|E

The precise number of MPs in each GRC is {{declared}} by the President at the Cabinet's direction prior to a general election. For {{the purposes of the}} 2015 general election, there were 13 SMCs and 16 GRCs, and each GRC had between four and six MPs.|$|E
5|$|An {{applicant}} has {{the burden}} of proving that a legislative restriction on {{the freedom of speech}} {{has nothing to do with}} public order, public health or morality. <b>There</b> <b>must</b> be some substance in the applicant's complaint – the Government does not have an immediate duty to justify making a decision that restricts the applicant's right to freedom of speech simply because the applicant complains of an alleged infringement of Article 15(1).|$|E
5|$|At {{the heart}} of this epic, Lee relays another {{personal}} story that impacts intensely, especially as the song breaks during the bridge and her voice takes flight like never before.

5|$|I {{examined}} Mr. Andrew Wilson on Feb. 15 & 16, 1982. He {{had multiple}} bruises, swellings and abrasions {{on his face}} and head. His right eye was battered and had a superficial laceration. Andrew Wilson had several linear blisters on his right thigh, right cheek and anterior chest which were consistent with radiator burns. He stated he'd been cuffed to a radiator and pushed into it. He also stated that electrical shocks had been administered to his gums, lips and genitals. All these injuries occurred prior to his arrival at the Jail. <b>There</b> <b>must</b> be a thorough investigation of this alleged brutality.|$|E
5|$|In 1650, German {{scientist}} Otto von Guericke {{constructed the}} first vacuum pump: {{a device that}} would further refute the principle of horror vacui. He correctly noted that {{the atmosphere of the}} Earth surrounds the planet like a shell, with the density gradually declining with altitude. He concluded that <b>there</b> <b>must</b> be a vacuum between the Earth and the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Individuals with {{breathing}} difficulties due to asthma or allergies may experience additional barriers to quality sleep {{that can be}} addressed by specific variations of sleep hygiene recommendations. Difficulty with breathing can cause disruptions to sleep, reducing the ability to stay asleep and to achieve restful sleep. For individuals with allergies or asthma, additional considerations {{must be given to}} potential triggers in the bedroom environment. Medications that might improve ability to breathe while sleeping may also impair sleep in other ways, so <b>there</b> <b>must</b> be careful management of decongestants, asthma controllers, and antihistamines.|$|E

5|$|Just {{like the}} many uses of plasma, {{there are several}} means for its generation, however, one {{principle}} is common to all of them: <b>there</b> <b>must</b> be energy input to produce and sustain it. For this case, plasma is generated when an electric current is applied across a dielectric gas or fluid (an electrically non-conducting material) {{as can be seen}} in the adjacent image, which shows a discharge tube as a simple example (DC used for simplicity).|$|E
5|$|The Council {{votes in}} one of three ways; unanimity, simple majority, or {{qualified}} majority. In most cases, the Council votes on issues by qualified majority voting, meaning that <b>there</b> <b>must</b> be a minimum of 55% of member states agreeing (at least 15) who together represent at least 65% of the EU population. A 'blocking minority' can only be formed by at least 4 member states representing at least 35% of the EU population.|$|E
5|$|The GRC scheme {{came into}} effect on 1 June 1988. Prior to that date, all {{constituencies}} were Single Member Constituencies (SMCs). Now, the Parliamentary Elections Act (Cap. 218, 2008 Rev. Ed.) ("PEA") states that <b>there</b> <b>must</b> {{be at least}} eight SMCs, {{and the number of}} MPs to be returned by all GRCs cannot be {{less than a quarter of}} the total number of MPs. Within those parameters the total number of SMCs and GRCs in Singapore and their boundaries are not fixed but are decided by the Cabinet, taking into consideration the recommendations of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee.|$|E

5|$|The illness {{emphasised}} certain {{traits in}} his character. He argued cuttingly, his biting satire did not shrink at insults, and his expressions could be rude and cruel. Though in general Marx had a blind {{faith in his}} closest friends, nevertheless he himself complained that he was sometimes too mistrustful and unjust even to them. His verdicts, not only about enemies but even about friends, were sometimes so harsh that even less sensitive people would take offence… <b>There</b> <b>must</b> have been few whom he did not criticize like this… not even Engels was an exception.|$|E

He could not accept any theory of two nations, however worded, because it would make of those neither French nor English second-class citizens.|$|E
5|$|After the {{destruction}} wreaked during the succession wars between Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II, Pompey restored {{the independence of}} Azotus, {{as he did with}} all Hellenising coastal cities (Antiquities Book 14, 4:4). A few years later, in 55 BCE, after more fighting, Roman general Gabinius helped rebuild Ashdod and several other cities left without protective walls (Antiquities Book 14, 5:2). In 30 BCE Ashdod came under the rule of King Herod, who then bequeathed it to his sister Salome (Antiquities Book 17, 8:1). By the time of the First Jewish–Roman War (66-70), <b>there</b> <b>must</b> have been a large enough Jewish presence in Ashdod for Vespasian to feel compelled to place a garrison in the city.|$|E

5|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that man is a social animal, Saint-Just argues that in nature {{there is no need for}} contracts, legislation, or acts of force. These constructs only become necessary when a society is in need of moral regeneration and serve merely as unsatisfactory substitutes for the natural bonds of free people. Such constructs permit small groups to assume unwarranted powers which, according to Saint-Just, leads to corruption within society. Because a return to the natural state is impossible, Saint-Just argues for a government composed of the most educated members of society, who could be expected to share an understanding of the larger social good. Outside the government itself, Saint-Just asserts <b>there</b> <b>must</b> be full equality between all men, including equal security in material possessions and personal independence. Property must be protected by the state but, in order to secure universal independence, all citizens (including women) must own property.|$|E
5|$|Chrysippus {{also argued}} for the {{existence}} of fate based on divination, which he thought there was good evidence for. It would not be possible for diviners to predict the future if the future itself was accidental. Omens and portents, he believed, are the natural symptoms of certain occurrences. <b>There</b> <b>must</b> be countless indications of the course of providence, for the most part unobserved, the meaning of only a few having become known to humanity. To those who argued that divination was superfluous as all events are foreordained, he replied that both divination and our behaviour under the warnings which it affords are included in the chain of causation.|$|E
5|$|Democracy {{essentially}} means {{rule of the}} people. To build {{a democratic}} society and rule, <b>there</b> <b>must</b> be citizen participation by an informed electorate. The freedom to speak and express is thus crucial {{for the formation of}} public opinion on political questions, and is indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth. In Singapore, the right to freedom of speech and expression is guaranteed to citizens by Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution, though it is subject to many qualifications. Parliament may by law impose restrictions on the right as it considers necessary or expedient {{in the interest of the}} security of Singapore, friendly relations with other countries, public order or morality, and restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide against contempt of court, defamation or incitement to any offence.|$|E
