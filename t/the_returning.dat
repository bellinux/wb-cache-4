5|$|After {{the poll}} closes, the {{presiding}} officer of each polling station seals the ballot boxes without opening them. Candidates or their polling agents may affix their own seals to the ballot boxes. The ballot boxes are then taken to counting centres {{to be opened}} and the ballots counted. A candidate or his or her counting agent may ask <b>the</b> <b>returning</b> officer for a recount of votes if {{the difference between the}} number of votes for the candidate with the most votes and any other candidate's number of votes is 2% or less, excluding rejected and tendered votes. After all counts, and recounts if any, have been completed, <b>the</b> <b>returning</b> officer ascertains whether the total number of electors registered to vote overseas is less than the difference between the number of votes for the two candidates with the highest number of votes. If so, <b>the</b> <b>returning</b> officer declares the candidate with the highest number of votes to be elected as President. If not, the overseas votes may be decisive. <b>The</b> <b>returning</b> officer then states the number of votes cast for each candidate and the date and location where the overseas votes will be counted.|$|E

5|$|In low-duty cycle echolocation, bats can {{separate}} their calls and returning echoes by time. They have to time their short calls to finish before echoes return.

The investigation of <b>the</b> <b>return</b> generating process is framed within the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) framework with the APT reinterpreted {{so as to}} provide a conceptual framework within which <b>the</b> <b>return</b> generating process can be investigated. In modelling <b>the</b> <b>return</b> generating process, <b>the</b> properties of South African stock returns are taken into consideration and an appropriate econometric framework {{in the form of}} Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedastic (ARCH) and Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedastic (GARCH) models is applied. Results indicate that <b>the</b> <b>return</b> generating process of South African stock returns is described by innovations in multiple risk factors representative of several risk categories. The multifactor model of <b>the</b> <b>return</b> generating process explains a substantial amount of variation in South African stock <b>returns</b> and <b>the</b> ARCH/GARCH methodology is an appropriate econometric framework for the estimation of models of <b>the</b> <b>return</b> generating process. <b>The</b> APT framework is successfully applied to model and investigate <b>the</b> <b>return</b> generating process of South African stock returns...|$|R
