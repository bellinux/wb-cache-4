50|$|The key for {{comparing}} the displacement between the 4-cycle engine and the rotary engine is {{in studying the}} degrees of rotation for a thermodynamic cycle to occur. For a 4-cycle engine to complete every thermodynamic cycle, the engine must rotate 720° or two complete revolutions of the crankshaft. The rotary engine is different. The engine rotor rotates at 1/3 {{the speed of the}} crankshaft. On two rotor engines, front and rear rotors are 180° offset from each other. Each rotation of the engine (360°) will bring two faces through the combustion cycle (the <b>torque</b> <b>input</b> to the eccentric shaft). This said, it takes 1080° or three complete revolutions of the crankshaft to complete the entire thermodynamic cycle. Obviously, there is a disparity. How can we get a relatable number to compare to a 4-stroke engine? The best way is to study 720° of rotation of the two-rotor engine. Every 360° of rotation, two faces of the engine complete a combustion cycle. 720° will have a total of four faces completing their cycle. 40ci(654cc) per face times four faces equals 160ci or 2.6L. That's a well-reasoned number and now gives something that can be compared to other engines. In addition, since four faces passed by in the comparison, it’s like a four-cylinder engine. The 13B therefore compares well to a 2.6L 4-cylinder 4-cycle engine.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Accurate dynamic {{modeling}} {{and analysis of}} flexible link manipulator (FLM) with non linear dynamics is very difficult due to distributed link flexibility and {{few studies have been}} conducted based on assumed modes method (AMM) and finite element models. In this paper a nonlinear dynamic model with first two elastic modes is derived using combined Euler/Lagrange and AMM approaches. Significant dynamics associated with the system such as hub inertia, payload, structural damping, friction at joints, combined link and joint flexibility are incorporated to obtain the complete and accurate dynamic model. The response of the FLM to the applied bang-bang <b>torque</b> <b>input</b> is compared against the models derived from LS-DYNA finite element discretization approach and linear finite element models. Dynamic analysis is conducted using LS-DYNA finite element model which uses the explicit time integration scheme to simulate the system. Parametric study is conducted to show the impact payload mass. A numerical result shows that the LS-DYNA model gives the smooth hub-angle profile. Keywords—Flexible link manipulator, AMM, FEM, LS-DYNA, Bang-bang <b>torque</b> <b>input...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a next {{generation}} exercise machine controller is developed {{for a single}} degree of freedom (DOF) system to maximize the user’s power output and ensure passivity with the user. In an effort to optimize the user’s power expenditure, a desired velocity trajectory is developed that seeks the unknown user-dependent optimal velocity setpoint. Two extremum-seeking algorithms are presented (e. g., Kristic and Deng, and Tuekosky et al.) that seek the optimal velocity setpoint while ensuring the trajectory is sufficiently differentiable. To track the reference trajectory and to ensure passivity, two controllers are developed. The first controller is developed {{based on the assumption}} that the user’s <b>torque</b> <b>input</b> can be measured. A second controller is designed that estimates the user’s <b>torque</b> <b>input.</b> Both controllers are proven to ensure that the exercise machine remains passive with respect to the user’s power output. The controllers are proven to yield semiglobal tracking through Lyapunov-based analyses.
