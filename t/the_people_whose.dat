After receiving a partial reimbursement for his wartime expenses, he moved with his wife, Emilie, to Argentina, where they took up farming. When he went bankrupt in 1958, Schindler left his wife and returned to Germany, where he failed at several business ventures and relied on financial support from Schindlerjuden ("Schindler Jews") – <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>whose</b> lives he had saved during the war. He was named Righteous Among the Nations by the Israeli government in 1963. He died on 9 October 1974 in Hildesheim, Germany, and was buried in Jerusalem on Mount Zion, {{the only member of}} the Nazi Party to be honoured in this way.|$|E
25|$|Goldsmith's close {{association}} with his brother, Sir James Goldsmith, his lifelong {{friendship with the}} controversial casino owner and conservationist John Aspinall, along with his anti-modernist stance and support for indigenous peoples, ensured that Goldsmith had many detractors throughout his life. Still, Goldsmith received affectionate support and respect from across {{the full spectrum of}} the environmental movement and from many of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>whose</b> views and preoccupations were the focus of his theoretical and philosophical critique.|$|E

The Tamil people were unhappy, feeling that they were greatly disadvantaged. Because Sinhala was now the official language, it {{made it easier for}} <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>whose</b> mother tongue was Sinhala to enter into government sector and also provided them with an unfair advantage in the education system. Tamils who also did not understand Sinhala felt greatly inconvenienced as they had to depend on others to translate official documents for them.|$|E

The people of Turkey thus became the first to lend a helping hand to Greece. Foodstuffs were collected by a nationwide campaign of Kızılay (Turkish Red Crescent) and the operation was mainly funded by the American Greek War Relief Association and the Hellenic Union of Constantinopolitans.

25|$|The fact that, {{in little}} more than a month, Pope Clement V died in torment of a loathsome disease thought to be lupus, and that in eight months Philip IV of France, at the early age of forty-six, perished by an {{accident}} while hunting, necessarily gave rise to the legend that de Molay had cited them before the tribunal of God. Such stories were rife among <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> <b>whose</b> sense of justice had been scandalized by the whole affair. Even in distant Germany, Philip's death was spoken of as a retribution for his destruction of the Templars, and Clement was described as shedding tears of remorse on his death-bed for three great crimes: the poisoning of Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor, and the ruin of the Templars and Beguines. Within 14 years the throne passed rapidly through Philip's sons, who died relatively young, and without producing male heirs. By 1328, his male line was extinguished, and the throne had passed to the line of his brother, the House of Valois.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the book}} was {{published}} anonymously, speculation on the authorship naturally began {{as soon as it}} was released. Many people were suspected, including, Charles Darwin ("I ought to be much flattered & unflattered"), the geologist Charles Lyell, the phrenologist George Combe, as well as many of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>whose</b> work the book often cited. Early on, Sir Richard Vyvyan, the Tory leader of the parliamentary opposition to the Reform Bill, was a popular suspect. Vyvyan held interests in natural philosophy, phrenology, and Lamarckian evolution. Only three years earlier he had privately printed his own evolutionary cosmology, a copy of which he sent to the English anatomist Richard Owen. The latter likely explains the discrepancy between Owen's critical letter to William Whewell on the Vestiges and his flattering letter to the author, whom he probably thought to be Vyvyan. It was even suggested at one point that Prince Albert might have secretly written it. Adam Sedgwick, as well as others, initially thought that the work was likely written by a woman, either Harriet Martineau or the Countess Ada Lovelace. A feminine authorship was thought to explain all of the book's scientific failings.|$|E

500|$|The book {{opens with}} a dream {{sequence}} in which a sculptor worships before a flower symbolizing beauty. [...] The sculptor struggles to capture his vision of beauty in a sculpture of an idealized woman. [...] In his artistic pursuits he neglects the reality around him and the toll the Depression of the 1930s has taken on <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>whose</b> paths he crosses—a neighbor who is beaten by her husband, violent social protest, jingoistic nationalists, and drunkenness. [...] He is engulfed in flames when he returns to his studio trying to flee it all.|$|E

500|$|As in comic books, {{the main}} {{characters}} have their identified color schemes and aliases. David's are green and [...] "Security" [...] or [...] "Hero", while Elijah's are purple and [...] "Mr. Glass". The colors show up in their clothes, the wallpaper and bed sheets in their houses, Elijah's note to David, and various personal items. <b>The</b> <b>people</b> <b>whose</b> bad deeds are sensed by David are identified by an article of clothing in a single bright color (red, orange), to contrast them with the dark and dreary color scheme typical {{of the rest of}} the movie (but not of most comic books). Several scenes also depict characters through reflections or doorways, as if framing them in a picture similar to comic books.|$|E

The local tribes of the area were the Yuggurapul of the Central Brisbane area; <b>the</b> Yugumbeh <b>people</b> <b>whose</b> {{traditional}} lands ranged from South of the Logan River, down to the Tweed River and west to the McPherson Ranges; <b>the</b> Quandamooka <b>people</b> <b>whose</b> traditional lands encompassed the Moreton Bay Islands {{to the mouth of}} the Brisbane River to Tingalpa and south to the Logan River; and <b>the</b> Gubbi Gubbi <b>people</b> <b>whose</b> traditional lands were known to exist north of the Pine River, to Burrum River in the north, and west to the Conondale ranges.

500|$|Charles and Ulrika Eleonora {{were very}} different. He enjoyed hunting and riding, while she enjoyed reading and art, and is best remembered for her great {{charitable}} activity. She was also limited by ill-health and numerous pregnancies. Charles was very active and busy and while Charles was away inspecting his troops or pursuing his pastimes, {{she was often}} lonely and sad. The marriage itself, however, is considered a success, with the King and Queen being very fond of each other. As queen, Ulrika Eleonora had little political involvement and {{was placed in the}} shadow of her mother-in-law. During [...] "The Great Reversion" [...] to the crown of counties, baronies and large lordships from the nobility, Ulrika tried to speak on the behalf of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>whose</b> property was confiscated by the crown. But the king told her that the reason he had married her was not because he wanted her political advice. Instead, she helped people whose property had been confiscated by secretly compensating them economically from her own budget. However Charles XI's confidence in her grew over time: in 1690, he named her future Regent, should his son succeed him still a minor. Instead Ulrika Eleonora predeceased him by almost four years. At the time of her death she was personally supporting 17,000 people.|$|E

2500|$|The {{abolition}} of the Palmerston District Council was a political error, but at first neither the Minister nor Gilruth saw it. The Council's importance, however, lay {{in the fact that}} it was [...] "the only symbol of representative government and democracy in the Northern Territory", and was made up of a small but influential middle class of Darwin, such as shipping agents, mine owners, landlords and ranking public servants. These were <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>whose</b> support Gilruth needed, but instead the Minister's announcement further alienated Gilruth from the townspeople.|$|E

2500|$|Perpessicius {{integrated}} his {{condemnation of}} antisemitism {{in a radio}} broadcast of 1934. It reacted against objections that his Antologia... had {{made a point of}} adding newly-emancipated Romanian Jews among examples of Romanian literature, reaffirming an earlier rebuttal: [...] "one cannot exclude a poet [...] based only on his nationality paper. The nationality of an artist is of less interest. In the eventuality, it is that of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>whose</b> language he uses in his writing. But what is certain is that the work is the distinguishing sign of art."
