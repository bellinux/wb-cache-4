500|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, the {{increased}} popularity and visibility of [...] "superstar DJs" [...] {{led to the}} creation of superclubs such as Liverpool's Cream and Sheffield's Gatecrasher. By 2003, however, electronic dance music clubs languished. [...] The Guardians pop critic, Alexis Petridis, attributed the [...] "terminal decline" [...] of dance music to its over-commercialisation by big-name DJs, such as Sasha, and to their demands for increased fees for performances. [...] Though dance music had been declared [...] "dead" [...] by many in the dance industry, Sasha continued to tour—despite the closing of many superclubs, including his resident club <b>Twilo</b> in May 2001.|$|E
500|$|Though {{frequent}} performing {{kept them}} apart for several years, Sasha and Digweed {{announced that they}} would reunite for a few Australian performances. [...] In November 2006, the duo performed at several venues, including Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne as well as numerous tour dates throughout 2007. [...] In 2008, Sasha and Digweed kicked off an American tour with a performance at the Winter Music Conference. [...] The duo played at mainly larger venues on the weekends and smaller (750-1000 people) shows on weekdays. [...] Sasha described their music as [...] "driving and dark" [...] with [...] "a little throwback of <b>Twilo</b> sounds".|$|E
500|$|In 1997, Ministry of Sound {{released}} Northern Exposure 2, Sasha and Digweed's next double-CD {{entry in}} their Northern Exposure series. To support the album, the duo toured internationally, {{and in the}} process helped to define the sound of trance music in the late 1990s. [...] After extensive touring, Digweed and Sasha took up residency at New York City's famous <b>Twilo</b> nightclub, where they would DJ for the entire night. [...] In 1998, the two released separate mix albums on the Boxed label, as part of the Global Underground series: Digweed's , and Sasha's , which drew from his experience touring on the West Coast of the United States. Both DJs formed their own record labels that year: Sasha created Excession Records and Digweed started Bedrock Records. Excession released fewer than ten records, the last in 1998; the experience, however, led Sasha to found the management agency [...] "Excession: The Agency LTD." [...] Excession remains a booking agency for many DJs, including Hybrid, Nick Warren, and Steve Lawler.|$|E
50|$|Saturday night {{events were}} hosted by {{resident}} DJ Junior Vasquez. In line with other superclubs like Tunnel and the Roxy, <b>Twilo's</b> Saturday nights were ostensibly gay-oriented but attracted some straight partygoers.|$|R
500|$|After {{the closing}} of <b>Twilo,</b> Sasha and Digweed {{embarked}} on their ambitious Delta Heavy Tour of the United States in 2002. Featuring veteran tour producer Kevin Lyman and opening act Jimmy Van M, the tour covered 31cities and played to 85,000people. [...] The appearances, complete with laser shows and video production, were more akin to rock concerts than to typical DJ events. [...] This development was new to the DJing scene, and compelled other DJs to host similar concerts. [...] A DVD of performance highlights, interviews, and behind-the-scenes footage was released as Sasha & John Digweed present Delta Heavy by System Recordings. [...] Ben Turner, creator of the DanceStar awards, retrospectively described the Delta Heavy tour as [...] "a landmark moment for electronic music". [...] Though the duo of Sasha and Digweed never explicitly split up, demanding schedules and frequent independent touring prevented any substantial collaboration {{for a long period}} after Delta Heavy.|$|E
500|$|Sasha {{reached a}} more {{mainstream}} audience with his remixes of Madonna's [...] "Ray of Light" [...] and GusGus's [...] "Purple" [...] for those artists' single releases. His success in pop music {{led him to}} score the music for the PlayStation video games Wipeout 3 and Gran Turismo. [...] In 1999, Sasha and Digweed reunited in the studio to record their third edition in the Northern Exposure series, [...] [...] In addition to mixing and DJing, Sasha joined Charlie May of Spooky to produce the Xpander EP, the title track of which many clubbers still view as [...] "one of the greatest trance tracks of all time". [...] He used the title track as a centerpiece for , his second Global Underground release. Sasha continued his collaborations with BT on the track [...] "Ride", which was released as a single on Yoshitoshi Records and on BT's Movement in Still Life. Soon after, he worked with Underworld's Darren Emerson on the single [...] "Scorchio", Sasha's first charting single in four years. In between touring and producing original material, Sasha and Digweed released the mix album Communicate in 2000, prompting them to temporarily leave their <b>Twilo</b> residency for a promotional tour of the United States. [...] Communicate had mixed reviews: Spin stated that despite a [...] "few stellar moments, [...] is ultimately a let-down". [...] LAUNCHcast, too, described Communicate as [...] "boring and lackluster...stalled in a monochrome world of dead beats".|$|E
500|$|Ali {{started working}} in the New York offices of Versace when she was 17. A {{colleague}} from Versace introduced her to producer Markus Moser, who {{was looking for a}} female-singer (or [...] "chanteuse") to collaborate on some of his original productions for a girl group in Germany. The two teamed up with Moser working on production, while Ali wrote the lyrics and vocals for the songs. Her first song was the single [...] "Rapture", which she wrote in 30 minutes based on an encounter with an Australian nightclub patron. [...] A demo of the song was first played at the New York club <b>Twilo</b> in 2001 and received early support from influential DJ Pete Tong who played the demo on his show on BBC Radio 1. The song eventually became an Ibiza favourite after support from prominent D.J.s such as Sasha, Danny Tenaglia and Sander Kleinenberg during the summer season. Released in late 2001 by Ministry of Sound, the single became a commercial success peaking at No. 2 on UK Singles Chart and Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play Chart, while charting in several countries in Europe. The success of [...] "Rapture", Ali said, caused the formation of iiO as the music they were initially working on was quite different from dance music and were asked {{to come up with a}} project name to promote the single. They originally named themselves Vaiio after the Sony VAIO laptop Ali used to write the lyrics on. The duo toured internationally and released several more singles, including [...] "At the End", [...] "Runaway", [...] "Smooth", and [...] "Kiss You". Their first studio album, Poetica followed in 2005.|$|E

50|$|Digweed {{has enjoyed}} {{popularity}} throughout North America {{as well as}} Europe. He and Sasha established a monthly residency at the now defunct New York club <b>Twilo,</b> which proved a key location for the American electronic music scene. The residency began in 1997 with a lukewarm reception, but grew {{into one of the}} most popular club nights in New York City by the end of its run in 2001. Sasha and Digweed played at <b>Twilo</b> on the last Friday of every month, playing sets that lasted between eight and twelve hours. In early 2001, Sasha suffered an ear injury and was unable to play for their last four dates before <b>Twilo</b> was closed by the New York City authorities. Digweed continued to play the time-slot by himself until 6 May 2001, when <b>Twilo</b> was raided by the NYPD and subsequently forced to close down.|$|E

50|$|On July 22, 2006, <b>Twilo</b> {{opened a}} {{location}} in the entertainment district of Miami, Florida. Their mainstay Saturday nights attracted a largely gay clientele, even though the club encouraged a mixed crowd. DJs such as Junior Vasquez, Peter Rauhofer, and Miami native Abel played on a consistent basis. Danny Tenaglia held a monthly residency at the venue on {{the second or third}} Friday of every month, depending on his touring and studio schedule. Like its New York predecessor, <b>Twilo</b> Miami was equipped with a custom Phazon sound system, with the club acting as an unofficial showroom for Phazon. State-of-the-art lighting walls manufactured by Element Labs bookended each side of the dancefloor, and were programmed and operated by veteran lighting director Drew Bongiorno. Due to economic pressures, <b>Twilo</b> Miami shut down in June 2007.|$|E

5000|$|During the 1990s, {{he became}} a {{prominent}} DJ by playing at highly regarded venues such as Palladium, the ROXY, and <b>Twilo.</b> In 1992, Tee co-wrote the RuPaul's top 40-hit [...] "Supermodel (You Better Work)".|$|E
5000|$|<b>Twilo</b> {{was also}} {{equipped}} with a state-of-the-art sound system known as Phazon. This sound system, originally built by Steve Dash, {{was at the time}} unique to the venue. The sound system at <b>Twilo</b> was highly regarded by patrons and DJs alike for its sound quality. Some DJs went as far as momentarily leaving the DJ booth to hear their favorite records on the dancefloor. After the closing of the club, the sound system was sold to Club Shelter.John Digweed, on his Transitions radio show on September 4, 2009, played an hour from one of his sets at <b>Twilo</b> from January, 2001. He's quoted as saying, [...] "I've dug into my vaults and I've found an hour from when I was playing at <b>Twilo,</b> that legendary club in New York City. It was just under nine years ago that I recorded this set, and I've gotta say.. without a doubt.. my favorite club that I've ever played, in the world. Just unbelievable, those 5 years I've spent there alongside Sasha were just great, great time of my life, and the crowd that made those nights so special." [...] In the middle of the set Digweed is also quoted as saying: [...] "It's definitely one of those legendary clubs that if you didn't get a chance to go, it was definitely a shame, because the sound system, the setup, the lighting, and the whole vibe was truly amazing." ...|$|E

5000|$|With {{the demise}} of <b>Twilo,</b> Vasquez began a new Sunday morning after-hours {{residency}} which he named [...] "Earth" [...] at the highest capacity club space in New York City, Exit Nightclub. Vasquez's gig at Earth ended without fanfare in 2002. In the years that followed, he held shorter-lived residencies at the various clubs in New York, including Discothèque, Sound Factory (so-named by Richard Grant who retained legal rights to the name and opened in a new space located in Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan shortly after {{the closure of the}} original site), Pacha (which opened in the site where the new Sound Factory once stood), Spirit (which opened in the former space where <b>Twilo</b> once operated), and The Roxy.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to his productions, Maas has been a longtime DJ, having been a resident at the legendary Ibiza nightclub DC10 for over 15 years and having also played in clubs such as Ushuaia, The End, <b>Twilo,</b> Tresor, Tunnel and many more.|$|E
5000|$|In June 1998 a 22 {{year old}} recent NYU {{graduate}} named Brigit Murray died from what first {{appeared to be}} a drug overdose at <b>Twilo</b> but was concluded by medical professionals to be an aneurysm triggered by first time ecstasy use. Friends of Brigit Murray had informed the police that while she had in fact visited the club earlier in the evening her death did not take place there. Almost 20 years later it was revealed by a close friend of Brigit's who was with her that night, that they did not actually purchase ecstasy at <b>Twilo,</b> but instead the narcotics were sent in the mail from a friend's cousin in Miami - completely absolving <b>Twilo</b> New York of any liability regarding Brigit's case. Another allegation was that undercover police during an eight-month period, also in 1998, had made 18 drug buys (of which two led to arrests). Daniel S. Connolly of the New York City Law Department stated: [...] "There are a series of serious public-safety issues that are of grave concern ... We believe we are able to convince the court {{that this is not a}} responsible organization that should continue to operate. The fact that people are dying inside of there that there is a pattern of reckless disregard of the safety of the clientele." [...] <b>Twilo</b> management on the other hand asserted that the club had done everything in its power to appease the city authorities even taking to extreme measures like hiring three undercover guards. It was apparently in connection with the accusations against the club for its lack of response to the previous drug incidents that the decision to retain EMT ambulances at the club throughout opening hours was made.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, invites {{were left}} at {{essential}} businesses, which included record shops and boutiques. During the late nights and early mornings (1:30 a.m. - 6:30 a.m.+), the prints were circulated both outside and inside nightclubs such as Tunnel, Roxy, Limelight, Palladium, Carbon, Club USA, Sound Factory (46th Street), and <b>Twilo.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Twilo</b> usually kept {{at least}} one small room open most nights of the week, but the {{weekends}} were far busier. Friday nights saw a younger and alternative straight crowd. <b>Twilo</b> regularly featured prominent American and European DJs playing trance, techno, and house music. Sasha and John Digweed had a monthly residency at the club, playing the last Friday of every month. Early in 2001 after Sasha suffered an ear injury {{in a car accident}} and was unable to DJ, John Digweed played the entire 8 hour time slot by himself until the closing of the club in May. Other DJs would play frequently such as Paul van Dyk, Carl Cox, Robert Fauver, Richie Hawtin aka (Plastikman), Danny Tenaglia, Merritt, Jeff Mills, Steve Lawler, Paul Oakenfold, Pete Marvelous, Pete Tong, DJ Dan, and Sven Väth.|$|E
50|$|His first {{residency}} {{was at the}} Brain club in London in 1990. He went on to play at clubs such as The End (club) and the <b>Twilo</b> club, and at {{events such}} as Tribal Gathering.

50|$|That {{all changed}} {{with the coming of}} John Digweed and his pal Sasha. Their {{residency}} at New York’s <b>Twilo</b> (the former Sound Factory) and extensive national touring propelled the more trancy European sounds and full-on DJ worship phenomenon into the spotlight in a big way. GU006 hit during this incredible period.|$|E

5000|$|Simon Noble & Rowan Blades collaborated {{to produce}} several tracks {{under the guise}} 'Breeder'. One of these tracks, named after the club is called 'Twilo Thunder' (Twilo's sound system was known for its thunderous bass, {{as well as its}} crystal clear mids and highs.) The system would {{sometimes}} produce bass rumbles which would mimic thunderstorms, hence the name <b>Twilo</b> Thunder. According to Noble: [...] "As Breeder we tried to create peak-time progressive house floor-fillers, and our aim was to make them rock and be good enough so that Sasha and Digweed would play them. The first tunes we wrote were 'The Chain' and 'Twilo Thunder', we gave them directly to Sasha and John Digweed and for over a year, they played them around the world at clubs such as <b>Twilo</b> in New York and Tyrant in London." ...|$|E

50|$|During {{the early}} hours of May 6, 2001, <b>Twilo</b> was raided and its {{occupants}} were evicted. The authorities cited the reason for the closing was an expired Certificate of Occupancy.

50|$|<b>Twilo</b> {{had been}} under {{pressure}} to close from then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani ever since the launch of his controversial quality-of-life campaign.
