When a couple of con artists arrive in Smallville promoting miracle cures created by the meteor rocks, Lex becomes interested in what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> after, as he believes their plans could hinder the research he is doing on the meteor rocks. After Jacobi and Wolfe's con is realized, Lex uses a dummy corporation to steal all of the meteor rocks Jacobi's Ascendence Foundation has collected. In Smallville: Dragon, Lex throws a party at his mansion for the local teenagers, that is ultimately crashed by a repitilian creature that {{was created by the}} meteor rocks. He is also visited by an old flame, Renata, who shows up looking to rekindle their relationship. Lex quickly discovers that she has an ulterior motive when she propositions him to fund a drug deal, which prompts Lex to realize that she was really sent by his father as some test for Lex.|$|E

25|$|In early rabbinic Judaism (the early {{centuries of}} the 1st {{millennium}} CE), the terms Ma'aseh Bereshit ("Works of Creation") and Ma'aseh Merkabah ("Works of the Divine Throne/Chariot") clearly indicate the Midrashic {{nature of these}} speculations; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> based upon Genesis 1 and Ezekiel 1:4–28, while the names Sitrei Torah (Hidden aspects of the Torah) (Talmud Hag. 13a) and Razei Torah (Torah secrets) (Ab. vi. 1) indicate their character as secret lore. An additional term also expanded Jewish esoteric knowledge, namely Chochmah Nistara (Hidden wisdom).|$|E

I played a small theater in Seattle, {{and the girls}} had flap skirts on and the tights cut off below their knees and lace gloves and rosaries and bows in their hair and big hoop earrings. I was like, 'This is insane!' After Seattle, all of the shows were moved to arenas. I've never done a bus tour. Everyone says <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> fun." ...|$|E

500|$|Hard as the Americans {{worked to}} {{incorporate}} {{themselves into the}} Grand Fleet, they had yet to shake a belief among the veteran British that they were amateurs merely playing at war. In writing to his American-born wife following the maneuvers, Admiral Beatty noted that, [...] "The American Squadron enjoyed themselves greatly while we were out, and did well, and will do better next time. I am sending old Rodman out on an operation of his own, which pleases him and gives them an idea that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> {{taking part in the}} war. I trust they will come to no harm." ...|$|E
500|$|She also {{assisted}} Thomas Hawkins {{with his}} efforts to collect ichthyosaur fossils at Lyme in the 1830s. She was aware of his penchant to [...] "enhance" [...] the fossils he collected. She wrote: [...] "he is such an enthusiast that he makes things as he imagines they ought to be; and not as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> found...". A few years later there was a public scandal when {{it was discovered that}} Hawkins had inserted fake bones to make some ichthyosaur skeletons seem more complete, and later sold them to the government for the British Museum's collection without the appraisers knowing about the additions.|$|E
500|$|So {{this song}} is about me {{basically}} saying that just because {{all of those things}} are there [...] doesn't mean that there is not sort of the same person underneath.

My Aura is the way that I deal with my insanity and I feel quite insane, so this song sounds very insane ... Everyone thinks that everything I do is a statement but some times I'm just moved by something passionate and I want to express it.|$|E

500|$|It {{has been}} noticed that [...] "Anyone {{could see that}} <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> great friends and their genuine {{connection}} is what translates into the music they create together." [...] After working with The Smeezingtons on Unorthodox Jukebox, Jeff Bhasker admitted that [...] "One of their great talents {{is that they have}} this fun, light vibe in the studio", something that enables anyone [...] "to be free so that you can let that primal emotion come out without being embarrassed. Then they polish afterward". Mark Ronson concurred adding that the key is on Mars' charisma, which he has had since he began impersonating Elvis. Ronson concluded, [...] "Everything Bruno adds is what takes it into superstardom".|$|E
500|$|In the album's liner notes, Gaye {{explained}} {{his views on}} the themes of sex and love, stating [...] "I can't {{see anything wrong with}} sex between consenting anybodies. I think we make far too much of it. After all, one's genitals are just one important part of the magnificent human body ... I contend that SEX IS SEX and LOVE IS LOVE. When combined, they work well together, if two people are of about the same mind. But <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> two discrete needs and should be treated as such. Time and space will not permit me to expound further, especially {{in the area of the}} psyche. I don't believe in overly moralistic philosophies. Have your sex, it can be exciting, if you're lucky. I hope the music that I present here makes you lucky." ...|$|E
500|$|In chapter 285, [...] "Kiss of Truth", Hild {{reveals that}} Keiichi's sexual desires for Belldandy have {{previously}} been sealed away {{in order to}} prevent humans and gods from mating, as would be the natural consequences of Keiichi's wish for a goddess to be with him always. This explains why Keiichi has never been very forward in their relationship. Although Belldandy has never lied about this situation, she has also never told him. When the old contract was dissolved and a new one is formed, Belldandy and Keiichi are immediately confronted with an Interracial Romance Inquisitor (Ansuz, mother of Belldandy and Skuld) who immediately sets a trial to determine if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> meant to be together, and should Keiichi fail, they shall be separated forever. Once passing the test, Belldandy and Keiichi are allowed by the heavens to live together as a proper couple, with their wedding ceremony being held in the final chapter.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{introduces}} two new {{characters to}} the series, portrayed by Aaron Munoz (Tony) and Michael Raymond-James (Dave). Although {{they were killed}} off in the episode, writer Robert Kirkman wanted to evoke a reaction that the characters would recur throughout the series. [...] "With the casting of those two guys and everything involving that scene we were really {{trying to convince the}} audience {{that they were going to}} be new regulars, so the end would be that much more shocking." [...] Kirkman felt that Tony and Dave represent new threats and anxieties for the group. [...] "I think this was a particularly good episode coming back because the two guys in the bar represent new threats and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> just the tip of the iceberg," [...] he stated. [...] "It's really good to come back and be off of the farm and see that there are more dangerous things out there than the zombies. Things just keep getting worse from here.". [...] "The Regulator" [...] by Clutch was the song used as the closing title sequence.|$|E
500|$|Songs such as [...] "Fight the Power", [...] "Power to the People", and [...] "Brothers Gonna Work It Out" [...] {{propose a}} {{response}} for African Americans {{to the issues}} criticized throughout the album. [...] "Power to the People" [...] has a tempo of approximately 125 beats per minute and elements of Miami bass, electro-boogie, and fast-paced Roland TR-808. Addressing their plight {{at the turn of}} the 1990s, [...] "Brothers Gonna Work It Out" [...] features cacophonic sound textures and a theme of unity among African Americans, with Chuck D preaching [...] "Brothers that try to work it out / They get mad, revolt, revise, realize / They're superbad / Small chance a smart brother's gonna be a victim of his own circumstance". Richard Harrington of The Washington Post writes that songs such as [...] "War at 33⅓" [...] and [...] "Fight the Power" [...] "may sound like a call to ohms and arms, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> a call to action ('turn us loose and we shall overcome'), a message to conscience and a plea for unity ('move as team, never move alone,' both cautionary advice and game plan)". [...] "War at 33⅓" [...] has a theme of resistance and a 128 bpm-tempo, cited by Chuck D as [...] "the fastest thing I've ever rapped to, rapping right on top of the beat".|$|E
500|$|At Oberstdorf, Tschaikovsky {{was visited}} by Tatiana Melnik, née Botkin. Melnik was the niece of Serge Botkin, {{the head of}} the Russian refugee office in Berlin, and the {{daughter}} of the imperial family's personal physician, Dr. Eugene Botkin, who had been murdered by the communists alongside the Tsar's family in 1918. Tatiana Melnik had met Grand Duchess Anastasia as a child and had last spoken to her in February 1917. To Melnik, Tschaikovsky looked like Anastasia, even though [...] "the mouth has changed and coarsened noticeably, and because the face is so lean, her nose looks bigger than it was." [...] In a letter, Melnik wrote: [...] "Her attitude is childlike, and altogether she cannot be reckoned with as a responsible adult, but must be led and directed like a child. She has not only forgotten languages, but has in general lost the power of accurate narration... even the simplest stories she tells incoherently and incorrectly; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> only words strung together in impossibly ungrammatical German... Her defect is obviously in her memory and eyesight." [...] Melnik declared that Tschaikovsky was Anastasia, and supposed that any inability on her part to remember events and her refusal to speak Russian was caused by her impaired physical and psychological state. Either inadvertently through a sincere desire to [...] "aid the patient's weak memory" [...] or as part of a deliberate charade, Melnik coached Tschaikovsky with details of life in the imperial family.|$|E

2500|$|According to Advaita Vedanta, Atman is {{identical}} to Brahman. This is expressed in the mahavakya [...] "tat tvam asi", [...] "thou are that." [...] There is [...] "a common ground, viz. consciousness, to the individual and Brahman." [...] Each soul, in Advaita view, is non-different from the infinite. According to Shankara, Atman and Brahman seem different at the empirical level of reality, but this difference is unreal, and {{at the highest level}} of reality <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> identical.|$|E
