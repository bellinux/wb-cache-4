5|$|Alternative {{versions}} of the Mellotron were manufactured by competitors {{in the early to}} mid-1970s. The Mattel Optigan was a toy keyboard designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> home, which played back sounds using optical discs. This was followed by the Vako Orchestron in 1975, which used a more professional-sounding version of the same technology. It was popularised by Patrick Moraz.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the movie}} {{is set in the}} fashion world, most {{designers}} and other fashion notables avoided appearing as themselves for fear of displeasing U.S. Vogue editor Anna Wintour, who is widely believed to have been the inspiration for Priestly. Still, many allowed their clothes and accessories <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film, {{making it one of the}} most expensively costumed films in history. Wintour later overcame her initial skepticism, saying she liked the film and Streep in particular.|$|E

5|$|The Dorniers were {{devoid of}} German equipment, {{including}} engines. The Yugoslavs found a French manufacturer {{to supply the}} powerplants instead. Gnome et Rhône was the supplier chosen, and the Gnome-Rhône Mistral Major engine was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dornier. The French had inflated the performance data of the engine, claiming it to have 649kW (870hp) and a speed of 420km/h (261mph) at 3,850m (12,320ft). The constant-speed propellers were also poor, and delivered late. This led to trials with Piaggio Aero and Ratier propellers.|$|E
5|$|The {{first such}} effort, Cosgrove Hall's {{animation}} of The Invasion episodes 1 and 4, was released to DVD alongside the surviving episodes in November 2006. The animation {{had been paid}} for by an earlier surplus in the Doctor Who website budget, allowing it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> DVD release as a test for the concept, at no extra cost. Despite the DVD's success, the sales were not high enough to offset the animation cost for any future collaboration.|$|E

5|$|Venus transits are {{historically}} {{of great}} scientific importance {{as they were}} used to gain the first realistic estimates {{of the size of the}} Solar System. Observations of the 1639 transit, combined with the principle of parallax, provided an estimate of the distance between the Sun and the Earth that was more accurate than any other up to that time.

5|$|A {{number of}} saints and {{historical}} figures have followed and presented specific approaches to Christian meditation.

The Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola use meditative mental imagery, {{with the goal of}} knowing Christ more intimately and loving him more ardently. In The Way of Perfection, St. Theresa of Avila taught her nuns how to try to get to know Christ by using meditation and mental prayer. Hesychastic prayer and meditation continues <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Orthodox tradition as a spiritual practice that facilitates the knowing of Christ.|$|E

5|$|A three-month quiet period descended {{upon the}} Eastern Front as the Soviets {{prepared}} their defences and the Germans attempted {{to build up}} their forces. The Germans used this period for specialised training of their assault troops. All units underwent training and combat rehearsals. The Waffen-SS had built a full-scale duplicate Soviet strong point {{that was used to}} practice the techniques for neutralizing such positions. The panzer divisions received replacement men and equipment and attempted to get back up to strength. The German forces <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> offensive included 12 panzer divisions and 5 panzergrenadier divisions, four of which had tank strengths greater than their neighboring panzer divisions. However, the force was markedly deficient in infantry divisions, which were essential to hold ground and to secure the flanks. By the time the Germans initiated the offensive, their force amounted to around 777,000 men, 2,451 tanks and assault guns (70 percent of the German armour on the Eastern Front) and 7,417 guns and mortars.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Karan Soni portrays Dopinder, a {{taxi driver}} who befriends Deadpool, and Jed Rees portrays a {{recruiter}} for Ajax. X-Men co-creator Stan Lee and Deadpool co-creator Rob Liefeld make cameo appearances as a strip club emcee and a patron of Weasel's bar, respectively. Rob Hayter makes a cameo appearance as Bob, Agent of Hydra, a recurring character in the comics alongside Deadpool. The rights for Bob are owned by Marvel Studios, who did not give permission for him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film, so his comic history and connections to the organization Hydra are not referenced in the film. He is instead explained as a former special forces operative like Wilson. Wolverine star Hugh Jackman was very supportive of Deadpool, and of it making fun of himself and his character, and {{is seen in the}} film via his People's Sexiest Man Alive magazine cover.|$|E
5|$|All six {{units are}} served by an {{independent}} wet limestone-gypsum flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) plant, which was installed between 1988 and 1996. This diverts gases from the boilers and passes them through a limestone slurry, which removes at least 90% of the sulphur dioxide (SO2). This is equivalent to removing over 250,000 tonnes of SO2 each year. The process requires 10,000 tonnes of limestone a week, sourced from Tunstead Quarry in Derbyshire. A byproduct of the process is gypsum, with 15,000 tonnes produced each week. This goes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> manufacture of plasterboard. The gypsum is sold exclusively to British Gypsum, and it is transported by rail to their plants at Kirkby Thore (on the Settle-Carlisle Line), East Leake (on the former Great Central Main Line) and occasionally to Robertsbridge (on the Hastings Line). DB Cargo UK transport the gypsum.|$|E

5|$|Although {{rain fell}} on Saturday morning, the track had dried by {{the start of}} the final free {{practice}} session. Lewis Hamilton again set the fastest time with 1:25.624, less than two-tenths of a second in front of teammate Rosberg, with Sebastian Vettel in third position close behind. The fastest times had been set on the super-soft tyre compound. However, Mercedes's advantage over Ferrari proved more significant, up to seven-tenths of a second on the harder soft compound, the tyre most likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> race. Toro Rosso confirmed their good pace for the weekend with fourth and sixth place for Carlos Sainz and Max Verstappen respectively, being about half a second quicker than their sister team, Red Bull Racing. A major incident occurred just seconds after the beginning of the practice session, when Rio Haryanto and Romain Grosjean collided in the pit lane. Both cars needed to equip new front wings and Haas also changed the floor on Grosjean's car. Haryanto was later issued a three-place grid penalty for the incident, as well as two penalty points added to his licence.|$|E
5|$|Between April 2008 and the film's {{commercial}} {{release in}} August 2008, the film had over 250 promotional screenings. On August 3, 2008, Stiller, Downey, and Black visited Camp Pendleton, a U.S. Marine Corps base in California, {{to present a}} screening to over a thousand military members and their families. The screening was {{on behalf of the}} United Service Organizations and included the actors heading to the screening by helicopter and Humvees. On August 8, 2008, a special 30-minute fictional E! True Hollywood Story aired about the making of Tropic Thunder.

5|$|Brachiosaurus is {{the first}} dinosaur seen by the park's visitors. It is inaccurately {{depicted}} as chewing its food, and standing up {{on its hind legs}} to browse among the high tree branches. According to artist Andy Schoneberg, the chewing was done to make the animal seem docile, in a way it resembled a cow chewing its cud. The dinosaur's head and upper neck was the largest puppet without hydraulics built for the film. Despite scientific evidence of their having limited vocal capabilities, sound designer Gary Rydstrom decided to represent them with whale songs and donkey calls to give them a melodic sense of wonder. Penguins were also recorded <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> noises of the dinosaurs.|$|E
