5|$|Commissioned by Queen Victoria in 1858, Garrard & Co. made a set {{of three}} large bow {{brooches}} containing more than 506 diamonds. There is no record of Queen Victoria ever wearing them; Queen Alexandra, Queen Mary, the Queen Mother and Elizabeth were seen wearing them frequently. The brooches are often adjusted to contain a large pearl or emerald diamond drop. Queen Mary was pictured {{on more than one}} occasion with the smaller Cullinan diamonds as <b>the</b> <b>drops.</b>|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of {{his role in the}} death of the god Baldr, Loki (described as father of Fenrir) is bound on top of three stones with the internal organs of his son Narfi (which are turned into iron) in three places. There, venom drops onto his face periodically from a snake placed by the jötunn Skaði. Loki's wife Sigyn collects the venom into a bucket, but whenever she leaves to empty it, <b>the</b> <b>drops</b> reach Loki's face, and the pain he experiences causes convulsions, resulting in earthquakes. Loki is further described as being bound this way until the onset of Ragnarök.|$|E
5|$|Like the Coronation Necklace, these {{earrings}} {{have been}} worn by queens regnant and consort at every coronation since 1901. Made for Queen Victoria in 1858 using the diamonds {{from an old}} Garter badge, they are of typical design: a large brilliant followed by a smaller one, with a large pear-shaped drop. <b>The</b> <b>drops</b> were originally part of the Koh-i-Noor armlet. After they had been made, Victoria wore the earrings and matching necklace in the painting Queen Victoria by the European court painter, Franz Winterhalter.|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} of an oil drop from a single capillary in a continuous phase flowing perpendicular to the capillary opening has been studied numerically. The shear stress at the interface of <b>the</b> forming <b>drop,</b> <b>the</b> angular velocity inside <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> and <b>the</b> pressure field around <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> have been determined in {{a cross section of}} <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> formation area. <b>The</b> results show a maximum pressure in the continuous phase near the stagnation point and a maximum shear stress in both phases nearer the top of <b>the</b> forming <b>drop.</b> <b>The</b> lowest pressures were found behind the top of <b>the</b> <b>drop,</b> where <b>the</b> surrounding flow starts to separate from the interface of <b>the</b> <b>drop.</b> <b>The</b> shear stress outside <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> causes a drag which, together with the drag originated from the pressure field around <b>the</b> <b>drop,</b> promotes drop detachment...|$|R

5|$|The Abbey Shield was {{designed}} by Pierre de Chaignon la Rose of Harvard University. It incorporates the personal coat of Saint Anselm of Canterbury and the first seal {{of the state of}} New Hampshire. In 1927, by a monastic vote, the shield design was incorporated as the official shield of Saint Anselm Abbey and the college. <b>The</b> <b>drops</b> in each quadrant represent the three drops of blood on Anselm's coat of arms, and the sheaf of five arrows is taken from the first shield of the State of New Hampshire, representing the five original counties of the state. Hence, the Abbey Shield has been interpreted as Saint Anselm of New Hampshire.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} a uniform {{electric}} field on the motion of a drop in an unbounded plane Poiseuille flow is studied analytically. <b>The</b> <b>drop</b> and suspending media {{are considered to be}} Newtonian and leaky dielectric. We solve for the two-way coupled electric and flow fields analytically by using a double asymptotic expansion for small charge convection and small shape deformation. We obtain two important mechanisms of cross-stream migration of the drop: (i) shape deformation and (ii) charge convection. The second one is a new source of cross-stream migration of <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> in plane Poiseuille flow which is due to an asymmetric charge distribution on <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> surface. Our study reveals that charge convection can cause a spherical non-deformable drop to migrate in the cross-stream direction. The combined effect of charge convection and shape deformation significantly alters <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> velocity, drop trajectory and steady state transverse position of <b>the</b> <b>drop.</b> We predict that, depending on the orientation of the applied uniform electric field and the relevant drop/medium electrohydrodynamic parameters, <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> may migrate either towards the centreline of the flow or away from it. We obtain that the final steady state transverse position of <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> is independent of its initial transverse position in the flow field. Most interestingly, we show that <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> can settle in an off-centreline steady state transverse position. Two-dimensional numerical simulations are also performed to study <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> motion in <b>the</b> combined presence of plane Poiseuille flow and a tilted electric field. <b>The</b> <b>drop</b> trajectory and steady state transverse position of <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> obtained from numerical simulations are in qualitative agreement with the analytical result...|$|R

This allows the wheel set to 'float' independently of the locomotive. The wheelset is lowered into <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> pit on a short section of rail, and a dummy rail, normally a part of <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> table machinery, is then inserted in the gap over the lowered wheelset. This enables the vehicle to be moved clear of <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> table on its remaining wheels, so that the removed wheelset can then be lifted out of <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> pit for maintenance work to be performed on it.|$|R

En route, he had flown over Task Force Growdon then held up at Sinwon-ni, a fact he passed to General Bowen. Shortly after 10:00, Ridgway saw a single stick of paratroops jump from a plane over the lower drop zone.

Surratt, who had moved forward enough to barely step onto the drop, lurched forward and slid partway down the drop, her body snapping tight {{at the end of}} the rope, swinging back and forth.

40|$|The {{dissolution}} of a multicomponent nanodrop in a sparingly miscible liquid is studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We studied both binary and ternary systems, in which nanodroplets are formed from {{one and two}} components, respectively. Whereas for a single-component droplet the dissolution can easily be calculated, the situation is more complicated for a multicomponent <b>drop,</b> as <b>the</b> interface concentrations of <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> constituents depend on <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> composition, which changes with time. In this study, the variation of the interface concentration with <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> composition is determined from independent numerical experiments', which are then used in the theoretical model for the dissolution dynamics of a multicomponent <b>drop.</b> <b>The</b> MD simulations reveal that when the interaction strengths between <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> constituents and <b>the</b> surrounding bulk liquid are significantly different, the concentration of the more soluble component near <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> interface may become larger than in <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> bulk. This effect is the larger <b>the</b> smaller <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> radius.

40|$|Effects of evaporation/condensation on {{spreading}} {{and contact}} angle were experimentally studied. A sessile drop of R- 113 was tested at different vapor environments {{to determine the}} effects of evaporation/condensation on the evolution of contact diameter and contact angle of <b>the</b> <b>drop.</b> Condensation on <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> surface occurs at both the saturated and a nonsaturated vapor environments and promotes the spreading. When <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> is placed in the saturated vapor environment it tends to completely wetting and spreads rapidly. In a nonsaturated vapor environment, the evolution of <b>the</b> sessile <b>drop</b> is divided three stages: condensation-spreading stage, evaporation-retracting stage and rapid contracting stage. In the first stage <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> behaves as in the saturated environment. In the evaporation -retracting stage, the competition between spreading and evaporation of <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> determines <b>the</b> evolution characteristics of the contact diameter and the contact angle. A lower evaporation rate struggles against the spreading power to turn <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> from spreading to retracting with a continuous increase of the contact angle. <b>The</b> <b>drop</b> placed in open air has a much higher evaporation rate. The strong evaporation suppresses the spreading and accelerates the retraction of <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> with a linear decrease of the contact diameter.
