25|$|When Peggy awakes, {{she finds}} herself back {{in the spring of}} 1960, her senior year of high school, after she passed out after {{donating}} blood in the school gym (where the reunion was). She finds all of her friends that she just left to also be their teenage selves, not just her. Still in shock, she allows herself to be taken home while she sees her surroundings are the way they were 25 years before. After a rough first night, she decides <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> the experience and behave as if everything is normal. However, when given the chance to break up with Charlie, she thinks it might be best since she knows how it will end.|$|E

When Geet's {{grandfather}} (Dara Singh) sees them both together, he thinks that they are a couple and that they are in love with each other. But no one seems to believe him. Aditya has fallen in love with Geet but is aware that Geet loves Anshuman (Tarun Arora). Geet decides to elope with Anshuman as she is sure that her family wouldn't agree for their marriage as their religions are different. When she escapes from her house along with Aditya, her family thinks that they both eloped. They go to Manali, where Anshuman resides. Geet requests Aditya to come with her and meet Anshuman, but he says that their journey together is over and bids her farewell, and the two part ways.|$|E
25|$|England started {{cautiously}} in {{the only}} Twenty20 International against Australia at the Rose Bowl, only hitting six runs off the first two overs as they saw off the bowlers, but Geraint Jones then decided <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> Brett Lee. Hitting two boundaries off the next over, Lee was hit for 14, and England moved rapidly to 28 for no loss before Jones cut McGrath to deep third man, where Kasprowicz took a catch on the boundary – out for 19 with four fours. Marcus Trescothick hit a single to end the over, but England were happy enough with 29 for 1 after four overs. Lee's next over was, again, hit for 14, as Lee served up one wide and a no-ball to end with three overs for 31 as singles were taken off every ball. That prompted a bowling change, with Michael Kasprowicz coming on for Australia, and with good reward, as the penultimate ball of his over was caught by Symonds at midwicket – Andrew Flintoff out for 6. Kevin Pietersen managed to scamper a single, and after six overs, England were 50 for 2.|$|E

500|$|The {{career of}} the {{character}} Daniel Baciagalupo/Danny Angel in the novel bears numerous similarities to that of John Irving.

I {{felt the need to}} be a little playful, because there were autobiographical parts of the last novel that were difficult for me." [...] In his last novel, Until I Find You (2005) Irving had alluded to his sexual initiation when he was 11, by a woman in her 20s.|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN wrote [...] "It wasn't {{the funniest}} of foreign land adventures, {{but it was}} serviceable.

500|$|Jesse Schedeen gave Arrows episode an 8.7 out of 10, {{noting that}} the Flash episode was [...] "saddled with the setup" [...] while [...] "Arrow gets <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> the payoff." [...] He felt the pace and storyline issues in [...] "Legends of Tomorrrow," [...] the Flash episode, were {{resolved}} satisfactorily. [...] The inclusion of flashbacks and time travel gave it [...] "a larger scope and an added sense of drama". As well, the Ollie subplot allowed Stephen Amell [...] "to show a much different and more vulnerable side to his character". Alisdair Wilkins awarded the episode a B+ noting [...] "how much better the show's entire dynamic is this season compared with last year". [...] He added that [...] "Legends Of Yesterday" [...] shows Oliver's conflict between keeping his friends safe and recognizing he cannot be victorious without them.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, John Levesque {{called the}} show a [...] "keeper" [...] {{in his review}} for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and applauded the series subtle, improvised style. Chicago Sun-Times {{journalist}} Phil Rosenthal commended the episode. In his review, he wrote, [...] "Rather than big laughs, it's more likely to elicit the grin of bemused recognition. It's not about sight gags or clever puns. It's not about parodying the sitcom form. This sweet ass seriesis not always subtle - unless a child showing another how <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> a runny nose is intellectual - but it nicely plays off the inherent absurdities and weirdness of everyday modern life." [...] Dennis Landmann of DVD Freak wrote that the episode [...] "sets up the tone quite well, for it develops the aspirations of Brendon becoming a filmmaker," [...] and praised the confrontational scenes that occur between McGuirk and Brendon.|$|E
500|$|Cornell {{stated that}} the biggest two {{influences}} on [...] "You Know My Name" [...] were Tom Jones, who performed the theme for Thunderball, and Paul McCartney, who composed and performed the theme for Live and Let Die. [...] "I decided that I was going to sing it like Tom Jones, in that crooning style. I wanted people to hear my voice," [...] Cornell said. [...] "And 'Live and Let Die' is a fantastic song. Paul McCartney wouldn't have written it if not for that movie. I [...] {{wanted to write a}} song in its own universe. I knew I'd never have it again — a big orchestra — so I wanted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> it." [...] Cornell did not put the film's title in the lyrics, because he [...] "couldn't imagine it fitting into a song lyric that would come out of my mouth". And he jokingly stated [...] "Casino Royale didn't make a good rock title, but I would write a song named Octopussy just for fun".|$|E

500|$|Ryan Stiles won {{the role}} of [...] "hapless janitor" [...] Lewis Kiniski. Despite being well known for his role on the British improve show Whose Line Is It Anyway?, Stiles still {{had to go through}} the {{audition}} process along with everybody else. He said, [...] "I don't even think Drew was really even aware of Whose Line at that time because it hadn't been on the air (in the U.S.) that many years. I think it was only on Comedy Central at that time." [...] Stiles admitted that he liked <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> his character and not psychoanalyze him. Following his appearance in The Beverly Hillbillies, Diedrich Bader realised he needed a regular income and decided to return to television. He tested out for The Drew Carey Show, but did not initially want to be cast in it. He told Kevin Smith that he wanted to drive up his price for the pilot of Partners. Bader lost out on {{the role of}} Bob to Jon Cryer and then learned The Drew Carey Show wanted to hire him to play Oswald Lee Harvey.|$|E
500|$|Kesha {{had been}} working on Animal for seven years prior to its release, and had written over 200 songs for the album. The {{abundance}} of material extended it from its originally planned twelve tracks to fourteen. Kesha felt that the album had an empowering, carefree message for young women. [...] "For girls, I think it's an empowering record, it's funny, it's cheeky," [...] she said. [...] "I think people need <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> whatever they're doing—makeup, their clothes, music, live shows—anything you don't need to take too seriously, don't take too seriously." [...] When asked how the album related to her life, Kesha explained that the album was completely autobiographical. [...] "I just write about what I live—literally, [...] I think there's a great pop song in anything and everything, any situation." [...] She cites her songs [...] "Stephen" [...] and [...] "Dinosaur" [...] as examples of this. She explained: [...] "it's about this guy I've been stalking since I was 15. I wrote the song when I was 16 with my mom, and I was like, [...] "This song's so dope, I know it is". [...] "Dinosaur" [...] came [...] "about [...] this old guy who was hitting on me, and his toupee was kind of falling off, and I was like, [...] "Oh my God, you're so old, you're prehistoric, you're like a dinosaur.

500|$|... "Billie Jean" [...] was {{recorded}} by American rock musician Chris Cornell for his Carry On album in 2007. Cornell {{said of his}} cover, [...] "I didn't plan on it. It just sort of happened organically. I changed the music quite a bit, I didn't touch the lyrics." [...] He added, [...] "And it's not a joke. I took a completely different approach to it, musically." [...] Cornell had previously performed the song live in Europe, including an acoustic set in Stockholm, Sweden in September 2006. He later said, [...] "I {{was getting ready to}} do some acoustic shows on a promotional tour for Revelations and I just wanted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> it." [...] The cover received favorable reviews from critics. MTV noted the [...] "bluesier, more pained and impassioned feel" [...] which stripped away [...] "any pop elements of the original". Los Angeles Times described the track as [...] "a grim, spooky take" [...] on Jackson's [...] "Billie Jean", and added that it was [...] "amusing enough, even if it sounds a lot more like Metallica's 'Nothing Else Matters'". The newspaper concluded that [...] "Jacko's mega hit [...] the stunt translation". In 2008, Cornell's version was performed live by David Cook on the seventh season of American Idol, and this version charted on Billboard's Hot 100 at No. 47. In May of the same year, dance act Signature used [...] "Nachna Onda Nei" [...] on Britain's Got Talent in their audition and again in their final performance. In 2011, Patrick Stump covered the song in an a cappella mash-up tribute to Jackson along with several other songs over pre-recorded backing vocals.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from January 7, 1911. It states, [...] "Miss Street's Seminary for Girls has a very ambitious class of pupils. The young athletes, not content with basketball and tennis, aspire to shine in the great American game, and organize a baseball club. They are so satisfied with themselves that they finally send a challenge to Adair College, which has a crowd of husky young athletes in a club that thinks it amounts to something. When the challenge is received, the boys are first angry, then amused. They decide to accept it, <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> the girls. The young women, after some practice, realize that their team, {{while it may be}} pretty to look at, is of little real use on the diamond. And the prospect makes them weep. Fortunately for the girls, Jack, the brother of the president, arrives from Harvard. His chum, Jim, is with him. These two young men are baseball stars themselves, and when they are told of the predicament of the girls, they goodnaturedly offer to help them out. The university men disguise themselves as girls, act as battery for the young women, and the college boys, who had looked for a laughable victory, are mowed down, inning after inning, because of the work of pitcher Jack and catcher Jim. The other members of the 'girl' team have nothing to do except look pretty. When the boy athletes have retired from the field vanquished, the girls reward their battery with one kiss - only one - from each of the other seven players." ...|$|E
500|$|Sean Connery as Professor Henry Jones: Indiana's father, a {{professor}} of Medieval literature who cared more about looking for the Grail than raising his son. Spielberg had Connery {{in mind when he}} suggested introducing Indiana's father, though he did not tell Lucas at first. Consequently, Lucas wrote the role as [...] "a crazy, eccentric" [...] professor resembling Laurence Olivier, whose relationship with Indiana is [...] "strict schoolmaster and student rather than a father and son". Spielberg had been a fan of Connery's work as James Bond and felt that no one else could perform the role as well. Spielberg biographer Joseph McBride wrote, [...] "Connery was already the father of Indiana Jones since the series had sprung from the desire of Lucas and Spielberg to rival (and outdo) Connery's James Bond movies." [...] Connery initially turned the role down as he is only twelve years older than Ford, but he relented. Connery—a student of history—began to reshape the character, and revisions were made to the script to address his concerns. [...] "I wanted to play Henry Jones as a kind of Sir Richard [...] Burton," [...] Connery commented. [...] "I was bound <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> the role of a gruff, Victorian Scottish father." [...] Connery believed Henry should be a match for his son, telling Spielberg that [...] "whatever Indy'd done my character has done and my character has done it better". Connery signed to the film on March25, 1988. He improvised the line, [...] "She talks in her sleep", which was left in because it made everyone laugh; in Boam's scripts, Henry telling Indiana that he slept with Elsa occurs later.|$|E
500|$|Fox was in {{negotiations}} to star as Jennifer Check since {{the film was}} announced in 2007, and was officially cast in October 2007. Fox said the reason she agreed to the role was her love for the script. [...] "I think what I loved about the movie is it's so unapologetic and how completely inappropriate it is at all times," [...] she said. [...] "That was my favorite part about the script and about the character. It's fun {{to be able to}} say the shit that she got to say and get away with it and how people find it charming." [...] Asked how acting in a film like this is different from acting in Transformers, Fox said [...] "there's [...] distractions, like there's no robots to distract you from whatever performance I do give. So, if it's terrible, you're gonna fucking know that it's really terrible". She said despite this aspect of the business being intimidating, she enjoyed portraying the character. [...] "I wasn't really sure what I was doing," [...] said Fox. [...] "I was just trying <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> it and I felt like I was able to make fun of my own image as to how some people might perceive Megan Fox to be. I was just sort of flying freely and I hope some of it works." [...] To prepare for her role as a living-dead teenager, Fox dropped to a near-frail 97 pounds and stayed out of the sun to keep her skin pale. In balancing out the film's horror with humor, she said she relied heavily on Diablo Cody's script and Karyn Kusama's direction to pull it off, stating, [...] "I have a very specific sense of humor, things that I think are funny aren't going to fly with middle America. It's going to eliminate some of the audience, so you need someone there to tell you you can't do that." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the screenwriting process, a {{stronger}} emphasis {{was placed on}} special effects, rather than satire and story. Overall, the tone of the film is in diametric opposition to the comics. Whereas Katz declared, [...] "It's a film about a duck from outer space... It's not supposed to be an existential experience... We're supposed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> this concept, but for some reason reviewers weren't able to get over that problem." [...] Gerber declared that the comic-book series was an existental joke, stating, [...] "'This is no joke!' There it is. The cosmic giggle. The funniest gag in the universe. That life's most serious moments and most incredibly dumb moments are often distinguishable only by a momentary point of view. Anyone who doesn't believe this probably cannot enjoy reading Howard the Duck."
