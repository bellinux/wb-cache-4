5|$|In 1878, {{as part of}} <b>the</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defences of Singapore against {{threats from}} European powers in the region, {{it was decided that}} forts be built {{on either side of the}} {{entrance}} to New Harbour. Fort Pasir Panjang was built on Labrador and Fort Siloso on Pulau Blakang Mati (now Sentosa). It was found that the steep cliffs and thick mangrove swamps surrounding the two forts acted as an ideal natural barrier to intruders.|$|E
5|$|The SDS wore {{either the}} 1940 pattern olive green {{uniform of the}} Royal Yugoslav Army, or the earlier Kingdom of Serbia pattern which was a green-grey {{in the case of}} officers, and a greyish-ochre colour for enlisted ranks. These were {{obtained}} from stores secured during the invasion. <b>The</b> <b>Review</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Serbian State Guard (Glasnik Srpske Državne Straže) was the official gazette of the SDS, published from 1942 to the end of 1943. The journal was edited by Jonić, and contributors included Nedić and Milan Aćimović.|$|E
5|$|The new Girlschool, now a five-piece group, {{signed with}} the PolyGram American {{subsidiary}} Mercury Records, once home of the American all-girls rock band The Runaways. The label saw in the band an opportunity to produce a rival for chart-winning female-fronted bands like Heart and Lita Ford and pushed {{the music of the}} band even more towards FM friendly American hard rock. The band was paired with producer Nick Tauber, who had produced the first albums of Thin Lizzy and the most successful albums of Toyah and Marillion, contributing also to the launch of the British glam metal act Girl. The resulting album Running Wild, sported ten keyboard-laden tracks much different from Girlschool’s most successful music. The record label decided to release the album only in the USA in February 1985, but actually gave little support to its marketing. <b>The</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magazine Kerrang! reflects the opinions of Dufort and McAuliffe, which described years later the album as rubbish or even worse. Running Wild had insignificant sales on the US market, not representing the breakthrough the band and the label had hoped for. A live performance of Girlschool as a quintet at Camden Palace in London was taped for the VHS Play Dirty Live, which was released in 1985 and reissued on DVD with the title Live from London in 2005.|$|E
