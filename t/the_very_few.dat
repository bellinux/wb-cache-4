5|$|Nyuserre {{is one of}} <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> Old Kingdom kings {{for whom}} there is {{evidence}} that the funerary cult continued uninterrupted during the First Intermediate Period, when the central authority of the pharaohs had broken down and the Egyptian state was in turmoil. The tombs of two priests Heryshefhotep I and II, who lived during this period, mention their roles and duties in the funerary establishment of Nyuserre, witnessing to the continuing existence of the official mortuary cult.|$|E
5|$|Somervell {{understood}} logistics and its {{paramount importance}} in modern warfare, and he spared {{no effort to}} ensure that the American fighting man had all he needed for victory. Near the end of the war, Somervell was promoted to general on March 9, 1945. He was <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> officers to be promoted to that rank during the war who had not commanded combat forces overseas.|$|E

5|$|Stela 10 {{was found}} in Group 21 {{together}} with Altar 6. They are among <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> monuments that were placed outside of the ceremonial centre of the city. Stela 10 was carved with a frame containing a figure, now badly eroded. The figure is standing with feet separated and turned outwards. Small hieroglyphic panels accompany it. Stela 10 had been moved from its original location, which was probably somewhere nearby.|$|E

5|$|Around 1770 {{the neoclassical}} {{architect}} Robert Adam designed Pulteney Bridge, a three-arched bridge spanning the Avon. He used as his prototype an original, but unused, design by Andrea Palladio for the Rialto Bridge in Venice. Thus, Pulteney Bridge became {{not just a}} means of crossing the river, but also a shopping arcade. Along with the Rialto Bridge, is one of <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> surviving bridges in Europe to serve this dual purpose. It has been substantially altered since it was built. The bridge was named after Frances and William Pulteney, {{the owners of the}} Bathwick estate for which the bridge provided a link to the rest of Bath.|$|E

5|$|Given {{the ferocity}} of the Russian defense, {{everyone}} was aware that {{such a move would}} cost the lives of thousands of Guardsmen, but it was thought that the presence of this prestigious unit would bolster the morale of the entire army for a final decisive push. A notable exception was Marshal Bessières, commander of the Guard cavalry, who was one of <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> senior generals to strongly advise against the intervention of the Guard. As the general staff were discussing the matter, general Rapp, a senior aide-de-camp to the Emperor, was being brought from the field of battle, having been wounded in action.|$|E
5|$|Groundwater {{levels have}} been dropping, to varying degrees, {{in many areas}} of the city, due in part to an {{increase}} in the amount of rainwater discharged directly into sewers rather than absorbed by the ground. A city agency, the Boston Groundwater Trust, coordinates monitoring of groundwater levels throughout the city via a network of public and private monitoring wells. However, Boston's drinking water supply, from the Quabbin and Wachusett Reservoirs to the west, is one of <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> in the country so pure as to satisfy federal water quality standards without filtration.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Beonna's life or his reign, as nothing in written form has survived from this period of East Anglian history. <b>The</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> primary sources for Beonna consist of bare {{references}} to his accession or rule written by late chroniclers, that until quite recently were impossible to verify. Since 1980, {{a sufficient number of}} coins have been found to show that he was indeed a historical figure. They have allowed scholars to make deductions about economic and linguistic links that existed between East Anglia and other parts of both England and northern Europe during his reign, as well as aspects of his own identity and rule.|$|E

5|$|Myrmecia {{is one of}} <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> genera {{where the}} workers lay trophic eggs, or {{infertile}} eggs laid as food for viable offspring. Workers laying trophic eggs have only been reported in two species; these species are M. forceps and M. gulosa. Depending on the species, colonies specialise in trophallaxis; queens and larvae eat eggs that are laid by worker individuals, but the workers do not feed on eggs. Neither adults nor larvae consume food during winter, but cannibalism among larvae is known to occur throughout the year. The larvae only cannibalise each other; this {{is most likely to}} happen when no dead insects are available.|$|E
5|$|Of <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> {{confirmed}} {{attacks on}} humans by wild killer whales, none have been fatal. In one instance, killer whales tried to tip ice floes {{on which a}} dog team and photographer of the Terra Nova Expedition were standing. The sled dogs' barking is speculated to have sounded enough like seal calls to trigger the killer whale's hunting curiosity. In the 1970s, a surfer in California was bitten, and in 2005, a boy in Alaska who was splashing in a region frequented by harbor seals was bumped by a killer whale that apparently misidentified him as prey. Unlike wild killer whales, captive killer whales are reported to have made nearly two dozen attacks on humans since the 1970s, {{some of which have}} been fatal.|$|E
5|$|Open {{heart surgery}} in India {{was at a}} nascent stage in the 1970s and early 1980s. After Panday {{returned}} to India from Canada, he joined the King Edward Memorial Hospital and Seth Gordhandas Sunderdas Medical College (KEM), in which he performed hundreds of open heart surgeries. The hospital was run on a government grant and generally catered {{to the middle class}} and poor, as the surgery was at the cost of the government. The hospital was one of <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> places in India where heart surgery was performed. Panday was the chief of the second unit at KEM.|$|E

5|$|Polonium has {{no common}} {{compounds}}, {{and almost all}} of its compounds are synthetically created; more than 50 of those are known. The most stable class of polonium compounds are polonides, which are prepared by direct reaction of two elements. Na2Po has the antifluorite structure, the polonides of Ca, Ba, Hg, Pb and lanthanides form a NaCl lattice, BePo and CdPo have the wurtzite and MgPo the nickel arsenide structure. Most polonides decompose upon heating to about 600°C, except for HgPo that decomposes at ~300°C and the lanthanide polonides, which do not decompose but melt at temperatures above 1000°C. For example, PrPo melts at 1250°C and TmPo at 2200°C. PbPo is one of <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> naturally occurring polonium compounds, as polonium alpha decays to form lead.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> {{remains of}} monastic {{architecture}} {{in the period}} are supplemented by brief documentary mentions. St Laurence's Church, Bradford-on-Avon appears to represent a unique near-complete monastic church of the period, and the angels in relief were probably {{part of a large}} rood cross group. Generally the contemporary sources give much more detail on the valuable treasures in precious metal, rich embroidered cloth, and other materials which the monasteries were able to accumulate, largely from gifts by the elite. The few pieces to survive mostly did so outside England, and include the silver Brussels Cross and a walrus ivory figure from a Crucifixion.|$|E
5|$|There {{were those}} {{concerned}} that the theatre was failing in its role as one of <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> permitted to show legitimate drama. Management of the theatre after it reopened in 1813 fell to Samuel James Arnold, overseen by an amateur {{board of directors and}} a subcommittee focusing on the theatre as a centre for national culture. (Lord Byron was briefly on this subcommittee, from June 1815 until leaving England in April 1816.) Actor Edmund Kean was the on-stage highlight; like Macklin before him, he made his reputation as Shylock, premiering in the role in 1814. Kean remained until 1820 through praise and notorious disputes with local playwrights such as Charles Bucke.|$|E
