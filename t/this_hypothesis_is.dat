40|$|We {{are now in}} the 21 st {{century and}} each {{organisation}} is forced to be on the move and be dynamic, and this depends on the motivation of those working in the organisation in question. In any profession, and nursing is no exception, motivation at work is immediately reflected in everyone´s performance at work. The aim of this thesis was to chart the work motivation factors which support the decision to follow a nursing career and to map the use of motivational programmes by hospital management. Five <b>hypotheses</b> <b>were</b> established {{on the basis of these}} aims. Hypothesis 1 : General nurses are motivated to pursue their career; <b>this</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> confirmed, as more than half of all nurses are satisfied with thein current positions and do not plan to leave their jobs within the next six years. Hypothesis 2 : The main motivational factor to pursue a nursing career <b>is</b> salary assessment. <b>This</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> confirmed. <b>This</b> factor ranked sekond out of a total of sixteen. Hypothesis 3 : For general nurses the prestige of the jo bis a motivational factor. <b>This</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> refuted; <b>this</b> factor ranked as the thirteenth most important. Hypothesis 4 : General nurses see the possibility of further education as a motivational factor. <b>This</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> confirmed. 89 % of those questioned see this as a very important factor.

40|$|Abstract Reality of {{cooperation}} of a stoma nurse with shift nurses Pernicious diseases of intestines and rectum {{often lead to}} creation of a temporary or permanent intestinal outlet alias stoma. Having been diagnosed, the patient is confided {{to the care of}} healthcare workers, in particular nurses, who endeavour to provide the patient with the highest possible quality care in the most intensive manner. At present, almost every hospital has a specially trained stoma nurse who should play the role of an advisor or coordinator in the nursing team. Regrettably, non-cooperation between shift nurses and the stoma nurse harm in particular the patient. Five <b>hypotheses</b> <b>were</b> raised. The first <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> to confirm whether the shift nurses on surgical wards cooperate with the stoma nurse more efficiently than the shift nurses in other than surgical wards. <b>This</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> confirmed. The second <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> to confirm whether the stoma nurse provides the shift nurses with regular information on developments in the concerned area. <b>This</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> not confirmed. The third <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> to confirm whether the shift nurses cooperate with the stoma nurse as early as in the period before the operation; <b>this</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> aimed at surgical nurses and was not confirmed. The fourth <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> to verify whether the shift nurses have sufficient information from the stoma nurse so that they could substitute her adequately when she <b>is</b> absent. <b>This</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> not confirmed. The fifth hypothesis verified whether the shift nurses ask the stoma nurse to provide them with information concerning correct handling of the stomal equipment. <b>This</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> not confirmed. The data were collected in the quantitative research supplemented with an interview with the stoma nurse. The shift nurses in surgical and non-operational wards obtained anonymous questionnaires. The research was conducted in seven hospitals in the Region of South Bohemia. The objectives were fulfilled. The information will be provided to deputy managers for the nursing care and stoma nurses. We believe that our results may contribute to higher efficiency of the cooperation between nurses, which will {{have a positive impact on}} provision of comprehensive care of patients with a stoma...|$|R

5|$|The major Ordovician–Silurian {{extinction}} events 450 {{million years}} ago may {{have been caused by}} a GRB. The late Ordovician species of trilobites that spent portions of their lives in the plankton layer near the ocean surface were much harder hit than deep-water dwellers, which tended to remain within quite restricted areas. This is in contrast to the usual pattern of extinction events, wherein species with more widely spread populations typically fare better. A possible explanation is that trilobites remaining in deep water would be more shielded from the increased UV radiation associated with a GRB. Also supportive of <b>this</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> the fact that during the late Ordovician, burrowing bivalve species were less likely to go extinct than bivalves that lived on the surface.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of their warming effects when {{relatively}} thin, cirrus clouds have been implicated as a potential partial cause of global warming. Scientists have speculated that global warming could cause high thin cloud cover to increase, thereby increasing temperatures and humidity. This, in turn, would increase the cirrus cloud cover, effectively creating a positive feedback circuit. A prediction of <b>this</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> that the cirrus would move higher as the temperatures rose, increasing the volume of air underneath the clouds and the amount of infrared radiation reflected back down to earth. In addition, the hypothesis suggests that the increase in temperature would tend to increase the size of the ice crystals in the cirrus cloud, possibly causing the reflection of solar radiation and the reflection of the Earth's infrared radiation to balance out.|$|E
5|$|Dysregulation of the {{ubiquitin}} proteasome {{system may}} contribute to several neural diseases. It may lead to brain tumors such as astrocytomas. In some of the late-onset neurodegenerative diseases that share aggregation of misfolded proteins as a common feature, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, large insoluble aggregates of misfolded proteins can form and then result in neurotoxicity, through mechanisms that are not yet well understood. Decreased proteasome activity has been suggested {{as a cause of}} aggregation and Lewy body formation in Parkinson's. <b>This</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> supported by the observation that yeast models of Parkinson's are more susceptible to toxicity from α-synuclein, the major protein component of Lewy bodies, under conditions of low proteasome activity. Impaired proteasomal activity may underlie cognitive disorders such as the autism spectrum disorders, and muscle and nerve diseases such as inclusion body myopathy.|$|E

5|$|In 1959, the Swedish team {{attempted}} {{to explain the}} Berkeley team's inability to detect element 102 in 1958, maintaining that they did discover it. However, later work has shown that no nobelium isotopes lighter than 259No (no heavier isotopes could have been produced in the Swedish experiments) with a half-life over 3minutes exist, and that the Swedish team's results are most likely from thorium-225, which has a half-life of 8minutes and quickly undergoes triple alpha decay to polonium-213, which has a decay energy of 8.53612MeV. <b>This</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> lent weight {{by the fact that}} thorium-225 can easily be produced in the reaction used and would not be separated out by the chemical methods used. Later work on nobelium also showed that the divalent state is more stable than the trivalent one and hence that the samples emitting the alpha particles could not have contained nobelium, as the divalent nobelium would not have eluted with the other trivalent actinides. Thus, the Swedish team later retracted their claim and associated the activity to background effects.|$|E
5|$|New {{research}} indicates that many white dwarfs—at least in certain types of galaxies—may not approach that limit by way of accretion. It has been postulated {{that at least some}} of the white dwarfs that become supernovae attain the necessary mass by colliding with one another. It may be that in elliptical galaxies such collisions are the major source of supernovae. <b>This</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> based on the fact that the X-rays produced by those galaxies are 30 to 50 times less than what is expected to be produced by type Ia supernovas of that galaxy as matter accretes on the white dwarf from its encircling companion. It has been concluded that no more than 5 percent of the supernovae in such galaxies could be created by the process of accretion onto white dwarfs. The significance of this finding is that there could be two types of supernovae, which could mean that the Chandrasekhar limit might not always apply in determining when a white dwarf goes supernova, given that two colliding white dwarfs could have a range of masses. This in turn would confuse efforts to use exploding white dwarfs as standard candles in determining distances.|$|E
5|$|Paranotal {{hypothesis}}: This hypothesis {{suggests that}} the insect's wings developed from paranotal lobes, a preadaptation found in insect fossils that {{is believed to have}} assisted stabilization while hopping or falling. In favor of <b>this</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> the tendency of most insects, when startled while climbing on branches, to escape by dropping to the ground. Such lobes would have served as parachutes and enable the insect to land more softly. The theory {{suggests that the}}se lobes gradually grew larger and in a later stage developed a joint with the thorax. Even later would appear the muscles to move these crude wings. This model implies a progressive increase in the effectiveness of the wings, starting with parachuting, then gliding and finally active flight. Still, lack of substantial fossil evidence of the development of the wing joints and muscles poses a major difficulty to the theory, as does the seemingly spontaneous development of articulation and venation, and it has been largely rejected by experts in the field.|$|E
