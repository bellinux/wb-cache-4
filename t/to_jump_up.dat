When he attempted to perform the Pedigree, Garner mistook the maneuver for a double underhook suplex and tried <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> with the move, causing him to land squarely {{on top of his}} head and suffer neck damage. Garner sued the WWF, eventually settling out of court and later discussed the incident in an appearance on The Montel Williams Show.|$|E

They scramble inside as the Angels start to follow, and the Doctor directs the group to the ship's oxygen factory, a forest contained within the ship. As they pass the primary control room, the Doctor notices a familiar crack in its wall, leaking time energy that the Angels are being drawn to.|$|E
5|$|Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter is a side-scrolling {{platform}} video game: {{the majority}} of the game features the player-controlled Commander Keen viewed from the side while moving on a two-dimensional plane. The player can move left and right and can jump, and can use a pogo stick to bounce continuously and jump higher than they can normally with the correct timing. The levels are composed of platforms on which Keen can stand, viewed from slightly above. Some platforms allow Keen <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> through them from below, while others feature fireman's poles that Keen can climb up or down. Keen can also grab onto the edge of platforms and pull himself up. There are giant switches which must be jumped up into or dropped onto to flip which have effects on the gameworld, such as retracting and extending gates or initiate moving platforms. Once entered, the only way to exit a level is to reach the end, though the player can save their game at any point. Between levels, the player travels on a two-dimensional map, viewed from above; from the map the player can enter levels by approaching the entrance or save their progress in the game. Some levels are optional to enter and may be bypassed, while portions of the map are gated off until specific levels are completed.|$|E

5|$|Commander Keen in Keen Dreams is a side-scrolling {{platform}} video game: {{the majority}} of the game features the player-controlled Commander Keen viewed from the side while moving on a two-dimensional plane. The player character can move left and right and can jump; unlike the prior trilogy of episodes in the series, known collectively as Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons, Keen cannot jump higher using a pogo stick. The levels are composed of platforms on which Keen can stand, viewed from slightly above so as to give a pseudo-3D effect, and some platforms allow Keen <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> through them from below, while others feature fireman's poles that Keen can climb up or down. Once entered, the only way to exit a level is to reach the end, though unlike in Vorticons the player can save their game at any point. In between levels the player travels on a two-dimensional map, viewed from above; from the map the player can enter levels by approaching the entrance or save their progress in the game. Some levels are optional to enter and may be bypassed.|$|E
5|$|Commander Keen is a side-scrolling {{platform}} video game: {{the majority}} of the game features the player-controlled Commander Keen viewed from the side while moving on a two-dimensional plane. The player can move left and right and can jump, and can use a pogo stick to bounce continuously and jump higher than they can normally with the correct timing. The levels are composed of platforms on which Keen can stand, viewed from the side as in the original Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons trilogy, and some platforms allow Keen <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> through them from below. The game also includes moving platforms and teleporters that Keen can respectively jump on and interact with. In between levels, the player travels on a two-dimensional map, viewed from above; from the map, the player can enter levels by approaching the entrance. Once entered, the only way to exit a level is to reach the end, or by resetting the game. When a level is completed, the player is given a password that records their progress, lives, and points; this password is entered when starting the game in order to resume where the player left off. The game is divided into three worlds, connected by a central hub area where the game begins and where Keen starts whenever a password is entered.|$|E
5|$|The three {{episodes of}} Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons make up one side-scrolling {{platform}} video game: {{most of the}} game features the player-controlled Commander Keen viewed from the side while moving on a two-dimensional plane. Keen can move left and right and can jump; after finding a pogo stick in the first episode, he can also bounce continuously and jump higher than he can normally with the correct timing. The levels are composed of platforms on which Keen can stand, and some platforms allow Keen <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> through them from below. The second episode introduces moving platforms as well as switches that extend bridges over gaps in the floor. Once entered, {{the only way to}} exit a level is to reach the end, and the player cannot save and return to the middle of a level. In between levels, Keen travels on a two-dimensional map, viewed from above; from the map the player can enter levels by moving Keen to the entrance or save their progress in the game. Some levels are optional and can be bypassed, while others are secret and can only be reached by following specific procedures.|$|E
5000|$|The {{game has}} been criticized as not being {{original}} enough (compared to its predecessor, Beyond Oasis) to justify its appearance on the Saturn platform. The gameplay was {{also referred to as}} frustrating at times, because its perspective can make it very difficult to tell how high or low a platform is in relation to Leon [...] - [...] it may force him to walk great lengths to get back to where he was prior <b>to</b> <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a platform that is too high. [...] Game Informer gave the game an 8.75/10.|$|R

25|$|The Greek playwright Aristophanes {{noted the}} {{abortifacient}} property of pennyroyal in 421 BC, through a humorous reference in his comedy, Peace. Hippocrates, the Greek physician, would advise prostitutes who became pregnant <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> and down, touching her buttocks with her heels at each leap, {{so as to}} induce miscarriage.

60|$|George came to Marvis Bay {{at about}} five o'clock {{one evening in}} July. Marvis Bay has a {{well-established}} reputation as a summer resort, and, while not perhaps in every respect the paradise which the excitable writer of the local guide-book asserts it to be, on the whole it earns its reputation. Its sands are smooth and firm, sloping almost imperceptibly into the ocean. There is surf {{for those who like}} it, and smoother water beyond for those whose ideals in bathing are not confined <b>to</b> <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> and down on a given jelly-fish. At the northern end of the beach there is a long pier. It was to this that George made his way on his arrival.|$|R

25|$|Mario's primary {{attack is}} jumping {{on top of}} enemies, though many enemies have differing {{responses}} to this. For example, a Goomba will flatten and be defeated, while a Koopa Troopa will temporarily retract into its shell, allowing Mario {{to use it as}} a projectile. These shells may be deflected off a wall to destroy other enemies, though they can also bounce back against Mario, which will hurt or kill him. Another attack, for enemies standing overhead, is <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> and hit beneath the brick that the enemy is standing on. Another is the Fire Flower; when picked up, this item changes the color of Super Mario's outfit and allows him to throw fireballs, or only upgrades Mario to Super Mario if he has not already. A less common item is the Starman, which often appears when Mario hits certain concealed or otherwise invisible blocks. This item makes Mario temporarily invincible to most hazards and capable of defeating enemies on contact.|$|E
25|$|Canine {{identification}} of a suspect can help police with their inquiries, and evidence of identification is accepted in some courts. The most approved method of identification is for the hound <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>up,</b> and place its paws on the subject’s chest. In {{the case of a}} lost person or a known fugitive identification will not be significant, {{and in the case of}} a potentially violent, possibly armed, fugitive a bloodhound handler will not want his dog to approach the quarry for fear of injury to the bloodhound. Many bloodhounds reaching the end of a trail will show no interest in the person they have been trailing, and are difficult to train to identify. Leon Whitney recommended a method of initial training in which identification was the first thing learned, based on giving the young hound a scent-article from someone who walks a very short distance out of sight into a barn, where he stands with a piece of liver, while another person, also smelling of liver, stands nearby. The hound is led along the 'trail', and if it shows an inclination to go to the wrong person it is chastised, but gets the liver if it goes to the right one. When the hound goes to the right person almost infallibly, the number of people is increased, making the choice more difficult, and eventually the brief walks are extended into full trails.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. High-speed {{sheet metal}} {{stamping}} is popular because it is economical and quick means of producing intricate, accurate and durable components in large quantities. Scrap <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> is one problem which usually occurs in high-speed stamping manufacturing processes.

25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{means for}} conversion of electrical energy into radiant energy in a fluorescent lamp relies on inelastic scattering of electrons when an incident electron collides with an atom in the gas. If the (incident) free electron has enough kinetic energy, it transfers {{energy to the}} atom's outer electron, causing that electron <b>to</b> temporarily <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a higher energy level. The collision is 'inelastic' because a loss of kinetic energy occurs.|$|R

The film is also notable {{for the number}} of cameo appearances by established celebrities and entertainment-industry figures, including Steve Lawrence as a booking agent, Twiggy as a [...] "chic lady" [...] in a Jaguar convertible whom Elwood propositions at a gas station, Steven Spielberg as the Cook County Assessor's clerk, John Landis as a state trooper in the mall chase, Paul Reubens (before Pee-wee Herman) as a waiter in the Chez Paul restaurant scene, Joe Walsh in a cameo as the first prisoner <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> on a table in the final scene, and Chaka Khan as the soloist in the Triple Rock choir. Muppet performer Frank Oz plays a corrections officer, and in the scene where the brothers crash into Toys R Us, a Grover and Kermit the Frog toy can be spotted. Right before the brothers crash into the Toys R Us, a customer (played by stunt coordinator Gary McLarty) asks the cashier if they have a Miss Piggy doll, a Muppet character that is voiced by Oz. Singer/songwriter Stephen Bishop is a deputy sheriff who complains that Jake and Elwood broke his watch (a result of the car chase in the mall). Makeup artist Layne Britton is the old card player who asks Elwood, [...] "Did you get me my Cheez Whiz, boy?"
