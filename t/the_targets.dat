5|$|Because of the {{proximity}} and Sun-like properties of Epsilon Eridani, in 1985 physicist and author Robert L. Forward considered {{the system as}} a plausible target for interstellar travel. The following year, the British Interplanetary Society suggested Epsilon Eridani as one of <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> in its Project Daedalus study. The system has continued to be among <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> of such proposals, such as Project Icarus in 2011.|$|E
5|$|On 15 June 1952, Overton led {{a bombing}} raid over Pyongyang {{to destroy a}} series of targets near the Pyongyang Air Base. <b>The</b> <b>targets</b> had been un{{successful}}ly bombed earlier by a similar strike force, but Overton's group was successful in destroying almost all of <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> while none of his aircraft took major damage from the 48 antiaircraft and 100 automatic weapons, and without harming the many nearby UN prisoner of war concentrations.|$|E

30|$|Due to <b>the</b> <b>target</b> {{detection}} probability drop, {{targets are}} sometimes localized and sometimes not. Depending {{on the length}} of the continuous time interval within which <b>the</b> <b>target</b> is localized, <b>the</b> MTT will create and maintain <b>the</b> <b>target</b> tracks. If <b>the</b> <b>target</b> is localized rarely, then <b>the</b> <b>target</b> tracks will not be created or will disappear.|$|R
5000|$|For moving <b>targets,</b> <b>the</b> point-of-aim {{is ahead}} of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> in <b>the</b> {{direction}} of movement.

30|$|To sum up, the {{infrared}} radiation of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> is very complex, which {{is because the}} factors affecting {{the infrared}} radiation of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> are multifaceted, including the radiation of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> surface, <b>the</b> absorption and reflectivity of <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> <b>the</b> climate conditions, the selective absorption and scattering of the atmosphere, the atmospheric scintillation, the velocity of <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> <b>the</b> surface coating and heat insulation, {{the noise of the}} circuit, and so on.|$|R

5|$|Hugo Sperrle's Luftflotte 3 {{ordered his}} dive bomber units to begin {{operations}} against the radar stations and airfields {{on the southern}} coast of Britain. <b>The</b> <b>targets</b> {{on the afternoon of}} 18 August were RAF Ford, RAF Thorney Island and Gosport, all belonging to the Fleet Air Arm or Coastal Command.

30|$|However, frames {{occasionally}} {{occurred in}} which no target was identified despite <b>the</b> <b>target’s</b> presence, 92 % (55 frames) of which were caused by occlusion. Due to estimation errors regarding <b>the</b> <b>target’s</b> position, in 23 frames, dis-identification occurred after occlusion. In each frame, <b>the</b> <b>target</b> was regarded not as <b>the</b> <b>target</b> but as <b>the</b> other candidate, and associated across frames. It is impossible to estimate <b>the</b> <b>target</b> position correctly during long-term occlusion. Therefore, a recovery method is required that will help with re-identification whenever <b>the</b> <b>target</b> is lost.|$|R

5|$|Targeting bore little {{resemblance}} to reality in that the sequence of attacks was uncoordinated and <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> were approved randomly – even illogically.

5|$|A {{number of}} the Khawarij met in Mecca and {{discussed}} the 659 Battle of Nahrawan, at which former supporters of Ali had rebelled against him for agreeing to discuss {{the leadership of the}} community with Muawiyah. They agreed to assassinate three of the leaders of Islam: ibn Muljam, a Jewish convert to Islam was to kill Ali, al-Hujjaj al-Tamimi was to kill Muawiya, and Amr ibn Bakr al-Tamimi was to kill 'Amr ibn al-'As. The assassination attempts were to occur simultaneously as the three leaders came to lead morning prayer in their respective cities of Damascus, Fustat and Kufa.

30|$|In this work, the {{detection}} performance of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> echo from CW ping signals is enhanced {{in the presence}} of reverberations. To this end, a reverberation suppression algorithm is proposed based on NMF and distinguishing characteristics between <b>the</b> <b>target</b> echo and reverberations. Specifically, three characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> are considered: <b>the</b> frequency structure of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> echo {{is similar to that of}} the Doppler-shifted transmitted signal, <b>the</b> <b>target</b> echo has time-continuous values, and <b>the</b> <b>target</b> echo has relatively short and finite duration. To use these characteristics, the frequency bases of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> echo are fixed by frequency-shifted transmitted pings, and constraints on the temporal continuity and TLL are developed.|$|R
30|$|Based on the distance/angle {{from the}} mobile camera to <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> <b>the</b> {{latitude}} and longitude of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> can be obtained. Finally, the trajectories of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> are smoothed by Kalman filtering (KF).|$|R
30|$|Taking {{into account}} <b>the</b> actual <b>target</b> in <b>the</b> {{short-time}} flight process, <b>the</b> <b>target</b> flight path {{will not have}} large sudden changes. This article uses the parabolic least square method formula to predict <b>the</b> <b>target</b> spatial position, which can effectively improve the robustness {{of the system and}} make <b>the</b> <b>target</b> lost. For a certain period of time, the device can still follow the correct trajectory to ensure that the system can still track <b>the</b> <b>target</b> correctly when <b>the</b> <b>target</b> reappears.|$|R
5|$|After calling at Balestrand, Kommandøren {{proceeded}} to Leikanger, where the soldiers on board disembarked.

Amongst <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> were the soldiers unloaded by Kommandøren, the troops being on the march to nearby Hermansverk. The attack killed a travelling salesman from Bergen outright, and wounded a 16-year-old local boy and the boy's mother, restaurateur Isak Roksvåg from Kommandøren and the ship's captain, Thorvald Johannessen.

5|$|All {{four main}} Einsatzgruppen {{took part in}} mass shootings {{from the early days}} of the war. Initially <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> were adult Jewish men, but by August the net had been widened to include women, children, and the elderly—the entire Jewish population. Initially there was a semblance of {{legality}} given to the shootings, with trumped-up charges being read out (arson, sabotage, black marketeering, or refusal to work, for example) and victims being killed by a firing squad. As this method proved too slow, the Einsatzkommandos began to take their victims out in larger groups and shot them next to, or even inside, mass graves that had been prepared. Some Einsatzkommandos started to use automatic weapons, with survivors being killed with a pistol shot.|$|E
5|$|Grimm {{mounted a}} second {{expedition}} in June 1981 aboard the research vessel Gyre, with Spiess and Ryan again joining the expedition. To increase {{their chances of}} finding the wreck, the team employed a much more capable sonar device, the Scripps Deep Tow. The weather was again very poor, but all 14 of <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> were successfully covered and found to be natural features. On {{the last day of}} the expedition, an object that looked like a propeller was found. Grimm announced on his return to Boston that Titanic had been found, but the scientists declined to endorse his identification.|$|E
50|$|The collimator's distant {{virtual image}} of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> subtends a certain angle, {{referred}} to as the angular extent of <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> that depends on the collimator focal length and <b>the</b> <b>target</b> size.

The second crew member was a Navigator trained as an Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) to decipher sensor information and guide the pilot towards <b>the</b> <b>targets.</b> However, the F-100F was an interim solution, since its limited payload often required multiple aircraft to conduct a successful strike; it also lacked the speed and endurance to effectively protect the F-105.|$|E
5|$|In 1973 the LPO {{was caught}} up in a {{recurring}} phenomenon of London orchestral life: the conviction in official circles that having four independent orchestras is too much for one city, and that two or more of the existing ensembles should merge.

50|$|Since {{shotguns}} {{are generally}} used for shooting at small, fast moving targets, {{it is important}} to lead <b>the</b> <b>target</b> by firing slightly ahead of <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> so that when the shot reaches the range of <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> will have moved into the pattern. On uphill shooting, this means to shoot above <b>the</b> <b>target.</b> Conversely, on downhill shooting, this means to shoot below <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> which is somewhat counterintuitive for many beginning hunters.
