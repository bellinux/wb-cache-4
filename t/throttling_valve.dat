40|$|Abstract. The <b>throttle</b> <b>valve</b> is a {{technical}} device used for regulating a fluid or a gas flow. <b>Throttle</b> <b>valve</b> {{control is a}} challenging task, due to its complex dynamics and demanding constraints for the controller. Using state-of-the-art <b>throttle</b> <b>valve</b> control, such as model-free PID controllers, time-consuming and manual adjusting of the controller is necessary. In this paper, we investigate how reinforcement learning (RL) can help to alleviate the effort of manual controller design by automatically learning a control policy from experiences. In order to obtain a valid control policy for the <b>throttle</b> <b>valve,</b> several constraints need to be addressed, such as no-overshoot. Furthermore, the learned controller {{must be able to}} follow given desired trajectories, while moving the valve from any start to any goal position and, thus, multi-targets policy learning needs to be considered for RL. In this study, we employ a policy search RL approach, Pilco [2], to learn a <b>throttle</b> <b>valve</b> control policy. We adapt the Pilco algorithm, while taking into account the practical requirements and constraints for the controller. For evaluation, we employ the resulting algorithm to solve several control tasks in simulation, as well as on a physical <b>throttle</b> <b>valve</b> system. The results show that policy search RL is able to learn a consistent control policy for complex, real-world systems. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{improved}} valving {{mechanism of}} the Corliss steam engine (Patented. 1849) was better able to adjust speed with varying load and increased efficiency by about 30%. The Corliss engine had separate valves and headers for the inlet and exhaust steam so the hot feed steam never contacted the cooler exhaust ports and valving. The valves were quick acting, which reduced the amount of throttling of the steam and resulted in faster response. Instead of operating a <b>throttling</b> <b>valve,</b> the governor was used to adjust the valve timing to give a variable steam cut off. The variable cut off was responsible for {{a major portion of}} the efficiency increase of the Corliss engine.|$|E

50|$|The cooling {{produced}} in the Joule-Thomson expansion makes it a valuable tool in refrigeration. In vapor-compression refrigeration, as used in common refrigerators and air conditioners, it produces cooling in the <b>throttling</b> <b>valve.</b> The effect is applied in the Linde technique as a standard process in the petrochemical industry, where the cooling effect is used to liquefy gases, and also in many cryogenic applications (e.g. {{for the production of}} liquid oxygen, nitrogen, and argon). A gas must be below its inversion temperature to be liquefied by the Linde cycle. For this reason, simple Linde cycle liquefiers, starting from ambient temperature, cannot be used to liquefy helium, hydrogen, or neon. However, the Joule-Thomson effect can be used to liquefy even helium, provided that the helium gas is first cooled below its inversion temperature of 40 K.|$|E
50|$|In 1951, Koehler and later, in 1972 Flammersfeld {{introduced}} a trick {{in the original}} Rüchardt setup, {{to increase the number}} of oscillations that are limited by the unavoidable friction-damping and gas leak (through the piston-tube seal): they made a thin hole on the tube (at half-height) and provided a gas-feeding pump to keep constant the pressure inside the vessel. By properly trimming the gas inlet flux (through a <b>throttling</b> <b>valve)</b> they obtained the following result: during the oscillations the piston is pushed-up by the gas overpressure until it crosses the hole position; then the gas leakage through the hole reduces the pressure, and the piston falls back. The force acting onto the piston varies at a rate that is regulated by the piston oscillation frequency leading to forced oscillation; fine adjustment of the throttle valve allows to achieve maximum amplitude at resonance.|$|E

40|$|A {{method of}} {{precisely}} controlling {{the position of}} a hydraulic actuator using an on/off valve is developed. Since valves exhibit little power loss when they are fully open or fully closed, the proposed system is more efficient than <b>throttling</b> <b>valve</b> control and can achieve flow variation without the expense or bulk of a variable displacement pump. Mating a pulse-width-modulated (PWMed) on/off valve with a fixed displacement pump and a smoothing accumulator creates a software enabled variable displacement pump. A drawback of using digital valve control for hydraulic systems is that the relatively low speed of the currently available switching valves results in a significant ripple in the pressure and flow rate. We propose a solution to this problem by using a <b>throttling</b> <b>valve</b> to shield the actuator from the ripple in the output. This creates an effective load sensing system with the <b>throttling</b> <b>valve</b> used only to provide a small known pressure drop between the supply and the load. This approach is significantly more efficient than the conventional technique of using throttling to vary the full flow.
