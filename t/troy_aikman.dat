5|$|The Dallas Cowboys, {{who were}} {{unsuccessful}} claiming Quinn 10 days earlier, claimed {{him after he}} was waived by the Colts. In Dallas, Quinn became the Cowboys second-string quarterback after <b>Troy</b> <b>Aikman</b> was injured and Jason Garrett became the starter. He played in three games for the Cowboys in 1998, completing one pass for 10yards. In 1999, Quinn did not play in a game for Dallas. During the 2000 offseason, Garrett {{signed as a free}} agent with the New York Giants and quarterback Paul Justin was signed by Dallas to compete for the backup spot with Quinn. He was released on May 5, 2000.|$|E
25|$|Dallas {{crushed the}} Packers with 450 yards of offense and five touchdowns. In {{the first half}} alone, Dallas quarterback <b>Troy</b> <b>Aikman</b> {{completed}} 16 of 21 passes for 278 yards and two touchdowns.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} {{telecast}} in the United States on the Fox network in 720p high definition resolution. Joe Buck and <b>Troy</b> <b>Aikman</b> called the game, while Pam Oliver (Giants) and Chris Myers (Patriots) were the sideline reporters.|$|E
25|$|When Romo {{started the}} Thanksgiving Day game against Tampa Bay, {{it marked the}} 7th {{different}} starting Cowboys quarterback in the last 7 Thanksgiving Day games (<b>Troy</b> <b>Aikman,</b> Ryan Leaf, Chad Hutchison, Quincy Carter, Drew Henson, Drew Bledsoe and Romo).|$|E
25|$|The second-year Panthers held Cowboys quarterback <b>Troy</b> <b>Aikman</b> to 165 {{passing yards}} and forced three interceptions {{en route to}} their first playoff win in team history. On offense, running back Anthony Johnson was their top {{performer}} with 104 rushing yards and a 9-yard reception.|$|E
25|$|In Week 13 {{against the}} Philadelphia Eagles, Romo threw three {{touchdown}} passes. The first pass, a 23-yard throw to Dez Bryant with 11:18 {{left in the}} third quarter, gave Romo 166 career touchdown passes, surpassing the previous franchise record of 165 which had been held by <b>Troy</b> <b>Aikman.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Cotton Bowl Classic {{has seen}} its share of great quarterbacks. Sammy Baugh, Davey O'Brien, Babe Parilli, Bobby Layne, Norm Van Brocklin, Y. A. Tittle, Bart Starr, Roger Staubach, Ken Stabler, Joe Theismann, Joe Montana, Dan Marino, Doug Flutie, <b>Troy</b> <b>Aikman,</b> and Eli Manning all have played in the game.|$|E
25|$|The Cowboys {{have had}} nine {{starting}} quarterbacks since <b>Troy</b> <b>Aikman</b> retired in 2000. They are Quincy Carter(started 32 games), Vinny Testaverde(started 15), the other games have been started by Ryan Leaf(3), Anthony Wright(3), Clint Stoerner(2 games), Chad Hutchinson(9), Drew Henson(1 game), Drew Bledsoe (22), and now Tony Romo is starting.|$|E
25|$|After quarterback Tony Romo {{completed}} a 25-yard {{touchdown pass to}} TE Jason Witten late in the third quarter, Romo eclipsed <b>Troy</b> <b>Aikman</b> as the all-time leader in passing yards in franchise history. The throw put Romo at 32,961 passing yards in his career, passing Aikman's career total of 32,942. Romo finished the game with 218 yards, putting him at 32,971 for his career.|$|E
25|$|With the victory, Tom Brady became {{just the}} fourth quarterback {{to win at}} least three Super Bowls. He joined Terry Bradshaw, Joe Montana and <b>Troy</b> <b>Aikman</b> on this {{exclusive}} list. Brady also became the fourth quarterback to throw a touchdown pass in three different Super Bowls. Other quarterbacks to do it were Terry Bradshaw, Joe Montana and John Elway, with Kurt Warner later accomplishing the feat during Super Bowl XLIII.|$|E
25|$|Super Bowl XLVIII was {{televised}} by Fox in the United States, with Joe Buck calling play-by-play, <b>Troy</b> <b>Aikman</b> as color analyst, and Pam Oliver and Erin Andrews as sideline reporters. The broadcast attracted 111.5million viewers, {{becoming the}} most-watched event in U.S. television history and surpassing {{the previous record}} of 111.3million viewers who watched Super Bowl XLVI in 2012. Episodes of New Girl and Brooklyn Nine-Nine were the lead-out programs.|$|E
25|$|The 1989 {{game between}} UCLA and Arkansas was highly publicized in the Dallas area because Bruin quarterback <b>Troy</b> <b>Aikman</b> was {{expected}} to be the top pick in the 1989 NFL Draft; the first pick was held by the Dallas Cowboys. Much was made of Cowboys longtime head coach Tom Landry watching Aikman practice at Texas Stadium, UCLA's practice facility for game preparation. Landry never got to draft Aikman, because he was fired the next month, but his successor, Jimmy Johnson, did. UCLA and Aikman won, 17–3.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} {{televised}} in the United States by Fox, with play-by-play announcer Joe Buck and color commentators Cris Collinsworth and <b>Troy</b> <b>Aikman.</b> Pam Oliver (Patriots sideline) and Chris Myers (Eagles sideline) served as sideline reporters. This {{marked the first}} time since Super Bowl I that none of the network commentators had ever called a Super Bowl game before (although Collinsworth had worked three prior Super Bowl telecasts as a pregame analyst). This was the last game that Cris Collinsworth broadcast {{as a member of the}} Fox NFL team, as he chose to sign with NBC in the following off-season.|$|E
25|$|Detroit had {{defeated}} Dallas 34–10 in {{the regular}} season, and this meeting would be no different. Quarterback Erik Kramer led the Lions to their first postseason victory since 1957 by completing 29 out of 38 passes for 341 yards and three touchdowns. Dallas quarterback Steve Beuerlein completed just seven of 13 passes for 91 yards and an interception, before being replaced by <b>Troy</b> <b>Aikman,</b> who was unable to lead the team to any points after stepping on the field. Overall, Detroit outgained the Cowboys in total yards 421-276 and forced four turnovers, without losing any of their own.|$|E
25|$|She has a daughter, Morgan Anastasia Gaddis (born December 22, 1980) {{from her}} first {{marriage}} to Ron Gaddis, a former bass player in George Jones' band; they were married for only a brief time from 1979 to 1980. She has a son, Jesse Keith Whitley (born June 15, 1987) with her second husband, Keith Whitley. That marriage lasted from 1986 {{until his death in}} 1989. After that marriage, she had a lengthy involvement with Dallas Cowboys quarterback <b>Troy</b> <b>Aikman.</b> In 1991, she married Brad Thompson, the one-time bus driver for Clint Black; they divorced in 1993.|$|E
25|$|Dallas {{took the}} opening kickoff and marched 75 yards to score on running back Emmitt Smith's 5-yard {{touchdown}}. Five seconds {{into the second}} quarter, the 49ers tied the game on quarterback Steve Young's 7-yard touchdown pass to running back Tom Rathman. But then the Cowboys scored three unanswered touchdowns to go up 28-7 before halftime. First they drove 80 yards in 11 plays to score on a 4-yard run by fullback Daryl Johnston. Then Thomas Everett intercepted the ball from Young and returned it 14 yards to the 49ers 24, setting up Smith's 11-yard touchdown reception from <b>Troy</b> <b>Aikman.</b> Five minutes later, Aikman finished a 72-yard drive with a 19-yard score to tight end Jay Novacek.|$|E
25|$|Defensive {{coordinator}} Dave Campo {{was promoted}} to head coach for the 2000 season. Prior to the season starting cornerback Deion Sanders was released after 5 seasons with the team. He later signed with division rival Washington. In Week 1, they were blown out 41–14 by Philadelphia. That game was very costly when veteran quarterback <b>Troy</b> <b>Aikman</b> suffered a serious concussion which ultimately ended his career. Longtime NFL QB Randall Cunningham filled in for Aikman {{for the rest of}} the season at QB. The Cowboys finished the season in 4th place with a 5–11 record. The only highlights of 2000 were Emmitt Smith having his 10th consecutive 1,000 yard rushing season and a season sweep over the Redskins.|$|E
25|$|Fox Sports {{televised}} {{the game}} in the United States, with Joe Buck as the play-by-play announcer and <b>Troy</b> <b>Aikman,</b> himself a three-time Super Bowl winner as a Dallas Cowboys quarterback, as the color analyst. Mike Pereira joined Buck and Aikman in the broadcast booth to comment on instant replay reviews, while Pam Oliver and Chris Myers served as sideline reporters. The pre-game show featured the Fox NFL Sunday crew of host Curt Menefee and a group of analysts with extensive Super Bowl experiences of their own: Terry Bradshaw (4 time Super Bowl winning QB with the Pittsburgh Steelers), Howie Long (one-time Super Bowl winning defensive end with the then-Los Angeles Raiders), Michael Strahan (one-time Super Bowl winning defensive end with the NY Giants) and Jimmy Johnson (two-time Super Bowl winning head coach with the Cowboys). They were joined by a variety of other commentators.|$|E
25|$|In the NFC Championship Game, Cutler {{completed}} 6-of-14passes for 80yards and an interception, {{before a}} knee injury sidelined him early {{in the third quarter}} of a 21–14 loss to Green Bay. The Bears did not make an immediate announcement about Cutler's condition, allowing speculation to grow. In possibly the NFL’s first player-on-player social media attack, Cutler was being criticized seconds after the injury by Maurice Jones-Drew, Darnell Dockett, Deion Sanders, and Mark Schlereth. Bears coach Lovie Smith later clarified that he, and not Cutler, made the decision after consulting the medical and training staff. The following day, an MRI revealed Cutler had sprained his MCL. Hall of Fame quarterback <b>Troy</b> <b>Aikman</b> commented that the widespread reaction reflected hostility towards Cutler's career-long polarizing attitude. Bears teammates defended Cutler, and his critics themselves became the targets of insults from other players, including Packers Aaron Rodgers ("disrespectful"), LeRoy Butler ("stupid"), and B. J. Raji ("pretty wrong and a lot times it has a lot to do with jealousy").|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Dallas quarterback <b>Troy</b> <b>Aikman</b> {{completed}} four consecutive passes on a 65-yard drive, the last a 25-yard touchdown to wide receiver Alvin Harper. Green Bay returner Corey Harris fumbled the ensuing kickoff {{out of bounds}} at his own 4-yard line. Green Bay still managed {{to drive to the}} Cowboys 31-yard line, with Favre completing a 48-yard pass to Sterling Sharpe on the way, but the drive ended there and Jacke hit the uprights on a field goal attempt from 49 yards. Dallas took over and stormed back on a 10-play, 45-yard drive, with Aikman's 22-yard completion to Smith and two more to Michael Irvin for 24 total yards. With 23 seconds left in the first half, Cowboys kicker Eddie Murray made a 41-yard field goal. On the ensuing kickoff, Dallas' Joe Fishback recovered Harris' second fumble of the day, this one forced by Kenneth Gant, and Aikman threw a 6-yard touchdown toss to tight end Jay Novacek, making the score 17–3 at halftime.|$|E
25|$|Running back Robert Smith {{helped the}} Vikings beat the Cowboys by rushing {{for a team}} playoff record 140 yards while also {{catching}} three passes for 58 yards and a touchdown. The Vikings also got a big performance out of quarterback Jeff George, who threw for 212 yards and three touchdowns, and receiver Randy Moss, who caught five passes for 127 yards and a touchdown. Dallas quarterback <b>Troy</b> <b>Aikman</b> threw for 286 yards and an interception in the final postseason game of his Hall of Fame career. This was also the final postseason game in the Hall of Fame career of running back Emmitt Smith, who rushed for 99 yards, caught a pass for 14 yards, and scored a touchdown. His 99 rushing yards gave him an NFL record postseason total 1,586 yards, surpassing the previous record of 1,556 yards held by Franco Harris. Cowboys receiver Raghib Ismail caught eight passes for 163 yards.|$|E
25|$|Oklahoma and Miami {{had only}} met six times, {{including}} this year's matchup. Between 1985 and 1987, Oklahoma was 33–3 {{with all three}} losses coming to Jimmy Johnson's Miami teams. It began in 1985 when the unranked Miami squad came to Norman to take on Barry Switzer's No. 3 ranked Oklahoma team. The Sooners lost the game 14–27, they lost their starting quarterback <b>Troy</b> <b>Aikman</b> to a broken leg, and Miami was propelled to the national stage. The next two times the teams met, OU was ranked No. 1 and Miami #2. In 1987, the two teams met in the 1988 Orange Bowl. Again, the Sooners lost. The game {{is said to have}} featured more talent than any other game in college football history. In the 1988 NFL Draft, thirteen Oklahoma players and twelve Miami players were drafted including four first rounders and four second rounders. The head coaches of both teams would both go on to coach the Dallas Cowboys and they both remain the only people to ever win a national championship in college football and the Super Bowl.|$|E
25|$|Dallas scored {{first on}} a 14-play, 88-yard drive in which <b>Troy</b> <b>Aikman</b> {{completed}} four passes to Michael Irvin for 65 yards {{and finished the}} drive with a 2-yard touchdown run. Perhaps the key point of the game occurred on the next series when Minnesota running back Amp Lee caught a short pass from quarterback Brad Johnson {{and appeared to be}} on his way for a 43-yard touchdown. But Cowboys safety George Teague caught up with Lee at the 1-yard line and poked the ball out of his hands, knocking it out of the end zone for a touchback. Dallas then drove 70 yards, including a 22-yard carry by Herschel Walker, to go up 10-0 on Chris Boniol's 28-yard field goal. Five plays after the ensuing kickoff, Teague stripped the ball from Vikings running back Leroy Hoard. Defensive back Deion Sanders recovered the fumble and lateraled it to Shante Carver, who was tackled on the Minnesota 37, and Emmitt Smith took off for a 37-yard touchdown run on the next play. Then during Minnesota's next possession, Teague intercepted a pass from Johnson and returned it 29 yards for a touchdown, giving the Cowboys a 24-0 lead with 8:36 left in the second quarter.|$|E
25|$|San Francisco then {{defeated}} their nemesis, the Dallas Cowboys, 38–28, in the NFC Championship Game. Expected to {{be a close}} game, the 49ers converted 3 Dallas turnovers into 21 {{points in}} the first quarter. On the third play of the game, cornerback Eric Davis returned an interception from Cowboys quarterback <b>Troy</b> <b>Aikman</b> for a touchdown. Wide receiver Michael Irvin lost a fumble on Dallas' next drive, setting up Young's 29-yard touchdown pass to Watters. Then Cowboys returner Kevin Williams lost a fumble on the ensuing kickoff, and it was recovered by kicker Doug Brien at Dallas' 35-yard line. Several plays later, Floyd scored on a 1-yard touchdown run to give San Francisco a 21–0 lead less than 8 minutes into the game. With the score 24–14 in the closing minutes of the first half, Aikman threw 3 straight incompletions, and a short punt by the Cowboys set up Young's 28-yard touchdown completion to Rice with 8 seconds remaining in the first half. The Cowboys eventually cut their deficit to 38–28 with a touchdown run by Emmitt Smith and Aikman's 10-yard touchdown pass to Irvin in the final period, but they were unable to score again. Although the Cowboys outgained the 49ers in total offensive yards (451–294), Aikman broke an NFC Championship Game record with 380 yards passing, and Irvin also broke an NFC Championship Game record with 192 receiving yards, Dallas was ultimately unable to overcome their first-quarter turnovers.|$|E
25|$|San Francisco {{running back}} Marc Logan {{returned}} the ensuing kickoff 50 {{yards to the}} Cowboys 48-yard line. Aided by a 16-yard run from Ricky Watters, San Francisco drove 48 yards and scored with Young's 1-yard touchdown run to take a 7–3 lead. Dallas was forced to punt on their next drive after <b>Troy</b> <b>Aikman</b> was sacked twice (one by Bill Romanowski and the other by Martin Harrison) for 19 total yards, and Grant returned the football to the Cowboys 47-yard line. San Francisco then drove to the Dallas 29-yard line, but the drive stalled there and Mike Cofer missed a 47-yard field goal try. After a punt, Watters lost a fumble that was recovered by defensive back Kevin Smith. Aided by a defensive holding call against Pierce Holt for holding up running back Emmitt Smith at the line on third down (the 49ers objected, stating that Holt was fooled by a fake handoff into thinking Smith actually had the ball), Dallas took a 10–7 lead with Smith's 4-yard touchdown run. A 21-yard reception by Rice sparked a 49ers drive to the Cowboys 10-yard line where Cofer made a 28-yard field goal {{to tie the game}} with less than two minutes left in the second quarter. Cofer's kickoff went out of bounds, giving Dallas a chance to score {{before the end of the}} half. Aikman managed to lead them to the 49ers 25-yard line, but Elliott's 43-yard field goal attempt went wide right and it was tied at 10 going into halftime.|$|E
500|$|Strasburg's {{high profile}} {{and the success}} of the Nationals in the 2012 season made the innings limit a topic of {{national}} conversation. In addition to baseball writers, a number of other figures made their views on the topic known, including football broadcasters <b>Troy</b> <b>Aikman</b> and Terry Bradshaw, basketball reporter Stephen A. Smith, and even prominent politicians such as Rudy Giuliani and Mitch McConnell. Rizzo [...] defended the decision to shut down Strasburg and criticized the buzz surrounding it: [...] "It's a good conversational piece, it's a good debatable subject. But most of the people that have weighed in on this know probably 10 percent of the information that we know, and that we've made our opinion based upon." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sunday, Cruddy Sunday" [...] was {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore and written by George Meyer, Brian Scully, Mike Scully and Tom Martin, the first credit Martin received for the series. Mike Scully jokingly said that the episode was [...] "thrown together without thought or structure" [...] by the writers. For the subplot, the writers tried {{to come up with}} the [...] "most boring thing" [...] Lisa and Marge could do to pass time. The episode features several guest-stars, including comedian Fred Willard, country singer Dolly Parton, Fox CEO Rupert Murdoch, sports commentators Pat Summerall and John Madden, and former American football players <b>Troy</b> <b>Aikman,</b> Rosey Grier and Dan Marino. All guest-stars played themselves, except for Willard who portrayed Kogen. The episode pokes fun at folk singer Burl Ives, former United States president Bill Clinton as well as the series' fans, among other things.|$|E
500|$|With {{temperatures}} reaching 122° on {{the artificial}} turf at Texas Stadium, the Giants played the Dallas Cowboys on September 16. The Giants dominated {{from the outset}} and used backup players heavily throughout the game. Lawrence Taylor batted a <b>Troy</b> <b>Aikman</b> pass high into the air, which he caught and returned for a touchdown. The Giants' defense held the Cowboys to 20 rushing yards and 156yards of total offense, while the Giants' offense gained 369 yards. The Cowboys totaled only nine first downs, averaged 1.8yards per rush and were dominated in time of possession, 41:40 to 18:20. Despite the 28–7 victory, Giants center Bart Oates still felt the offense could improve its play: [...] "e missed a lot of assignments. We rushed the ball O.K., but not like we did against Buffalo in preseason. Phil was pressured some. There were plenty of things we didn't do." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} American comedian Fred Willard as Wally Kogen. Scully stated that, {{for many}} years, the Simpsons staff had wanted Willard to guest-star in an episode, {{and that they}} had been looking for a character for Willard to portray. Scully also stated that Willard was [...] "great fun" [...] to have on the show. Wally Kogen's name is taken from two former writers on The Simpsons; the character's first name, Wally, is taken from Wallace Wolodarsky, and the character's last name, Kogen, is taken from Jay Kogen. The episode also features former football players Rosey Grier, <b>Troy</b> <b>Aikman</b> and Dan Marino as themselves. Scully stated that, when athletes guest-star in television shows, their performances are [...] "not always the greatest", however, he asserted, Aikman, Grier and Marino were all [...] "really funny" [...] and [...] "did a great job". Country singer Dolly Parton guest-starred as herself as well. Scully stated that he was [...] "shocked" [...] by how short Parton was, however he added that she was [...] "very nice" [...] and [...] "thrilled" [...] to be in the episode. Also featured in the episode is Rupert Murdoch, creator of the Fox Broadcasting Company. Originally, the writers wanted Murdoch to be portrayed by Castellaneta, the voice of Homer among other characters in the series. However, after a while, the writers decided to ask if Murdoch would guest-star as himself. Scully comments that the writers were [...] "impressed" [...] that Murdoch would introduce himself as a [...] "billionaire tyrant" [...] in the episode.|$|E
