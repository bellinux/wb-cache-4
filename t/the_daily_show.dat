5|$|In {{a survey}} {{released}} by the Pew Research Center in April 2007, viewers who watch both The Colbert Report and <b>The</b> <b>Daily</b> <b>Show</b> {{tend to be more}} knowledgeable about news than audiences of other news sources. Approximately 54% of The Colbert Report and <b>The</b> <b>Daily</b> <b>Show</b> viewers scored in the high knowledge range, followed by Jim Lehrer's program at 53% and Bill O'Reilly's program at 51%, significantly higher than the 34% of network morning show viewers. The survey shows that changing news formats have not made much difference on how much the public knows about national and international affairs, but adds that there is no clear connection between news formats and what audiences know. The Project for Excellence in Journalism released a content analysis report suggesting that <b>The</b> <b>Daily</b> <b>Show</b> comes close to providing the complete daily news.|$|E

5|$|Rachel Larris, who {{has also}} {{conducted}} an academic study of <b>The</b> <b>Daily</b> <b>Show,</b> disputes the findings of Baumgartner and Morris. Larris argues that the study measured cynicism in overly broad terms, {{and that it would}} be extremely hard to find a causal link between viewing <b>The</b> <b>Daily</b> <b>Show</b> and thinking or acting in a particular way. Bloggers such as Marty Kaplan of The Huffington Post argue that so long as Stewart's comedy is grounded in truth, responsibility for increased cynicism belongs to the political and media figures themselves, not the comedian who satirizes them.|$|E

A graduate of Binghamton University, she was an executive producer of Steve Harvey's Big Time and a talent coordinator for Late Night with David Letterman.|$|E
