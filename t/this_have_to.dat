5000|$|A recent {{criticism}} by Prof. Marcel van der Linden is as follows: [...] "Marx's thesis {{is based on}} two dubious assumptions, namely that labour needs to be offered for sale by {{the person who is}} the actual bearer and owner of such labour, and that the person who sells the labour sells nothing else. Why does <b>this</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be the case? Why can labour not be sold by a party other than the bearer? What prevents the person who provides labour (his or her own or that of somebody else) from offering packages combining the labour with labour means? And why can a slave not perform wage labour for his master at the estate of some third party?" [...] This difficulty was first noted in research conducted during the 1980s by Tom Brass, gathered together in his 1999 book. The buying and selling of human work effort can and has taken many more different forms than Marx acknowledges—especially in the area of services. A modern information society makes possible all kinds of new forms of hustling.|$|E
