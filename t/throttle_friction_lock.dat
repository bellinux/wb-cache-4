In this letter, we investigate the role of friction in modulating the nonlinearity that arises due to self-contact of scales through an analytical investigation.

40|$|In active, toddler sized hand {{prostheses}} the cosmetic glove {{introduces a}} stiffness which causes the required operation forces {{to be too}} high to be generated by toddlers. The Wilmer WHD- 4 was measured with 3 different cosmetic gloves. Despite using gloves of identical size and brand, different glove stiffness characteristic curves were measured. The goal {{of this study is}} to design a voluntary closing toddler sized hand prosthesis using an adjustable glove compensation mechanism. A prototype of the glove compensated hand prosthesis (GCHP) was designed and manufactured. High <b>friction</b> <b>locked</b> the compensation mechanism over the range of motion and prevented it from functioning. To investigate the causes of the higher than predicted friction, the prototype was examined in assembled and disassembled state. Imperfections of the manufactured GCHP hand basis were causing the mechanism to lock. The GCHP hand basis is a complicated part to manufacture and proved to be susceptible to precision errors. A test block, based on the GCHP hand basis, was designed and manufactured to measure the standalone compensation mechanism. Springs with lower stiffness are used in the measurement to reduce the forces on the axes. The mechanism did not lock in place and the behavior was measured. It was concluded that the mechanism does not result in a proper compensation characteristic due to the high frictional forces. The solution lies in heat treatment of the cosmetic gloves. Heat treatment will decrease the glove stiffness significantly. The lower glove stiffness will be accompanied with two phenomena: the required spring volume will decrease and the forces on the axes of the mechanism will decrease. Both these aspects will decrease the friction present in the system. The conclusion of this research is that to make glove compensation possible, the stiffness and hysteresis of the cosmetic gloves has to be reduced. Heat treatment of cosmetic gloves presented by Herder et al. showed promising results and should be further researched.

40|$|Locking {{mechanisms}} {{are used in}} a wide range of applications including energy saving mechanisms in the field of robotics. In this thesis a new class of locking mechanisms is investigated: a combination between a singular- and a <b>friction</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism (singular-friction locker) which is statically balanced with one additional spring. This combination of three types of locking mechanisms results in a locking mechanism that has an infinite number of locking positions, can unlock well under load and has an absolute zero actuation force in a singular configuration. In all other configurations the mechanism is theoretically in static balance. The first part of this thesis investigates rigid body type statically balanced singular-friction lockers (SBS-FLs) and works towards a classification of all possible classes of SBS-FLs. This classification contains nine types of rigid body SBS-FLs, consisting of one linkage type class of lockers and eight cam type classes of lockers. In the second part of this thesis different embodiments of SBS-FL {{mechanisms are}} investigated on their ability to become a very compact locking device. From five different concepts the highest compactness is obtained by a locking mechanism with a rotational cam input and a rotational follower connected to torsion springs. This mechanism is build and all design aspects are reported. In the third and last part of this thesis the performance and the characteristics of the prototype are investigated. The locking device has a zero actuation torque in the 'engaged' and 'disengaged' (singular) configurations and a maximum actuation torque of 0. 035 Nm when switching 'on' and 'off' in 5 seconds. This is a 97 % reduction of the actuation torque compared to a regular brake. The maximum braking torque is 0. 83 Nm in clockwise direction and 0. 75 Nm in counter clockwise direction. The locking device has a diameter of 55 mm and a length of 23 mm. This efficient and small cam based prototype seems to be the most promising approach to statically balanced locking and can find its use not only in robotics but also for example in cars, trucks, bikes and trains.

40|$|It has {{recently}} been proposed by several authors that stress distribution around active faults may become critical spontaneously. Other authors believe that heterogeneity is a permanent feature of fault planes. We test these ideas on a simple but realistic fault model {{in the presence of}} non-linear rate-dependent friction. We find that if friction increases with decreasing slip rate, slip becomes unstable at low slip rates generating supersonic healing phases that lock slip prematurely. Locking of slip in turn produces stress heterogeneity. For a fault model containing a single localized asperity, Das and Okubo found that rupture starts at the asperity and propagates until it either encounters a strong barrier or the stress intensity reduces below a minimum level. Rupture in these models is completely controlled by the physics of the rupture front. Rate dependent friction changes the behavior of the fault in a fundamental way: <b>friction</b> can <b>lock</b> the fault prematurely generating supersonic healing phases. Unlike stopping phases produced by barriers, a healing phase is not a wave phenomenon; it is a direct consequence of the non-linearity of friction. In this case rise time for slip on the fault is no longer controlled by the overall size of the fault as in conventional constant-friction crack models. We find that in our asperity models it is rise time or the healing mechanism that controls the final size of the fault. Studying models involving several isolated asperities we find that stress heterogeneity is preserved provided that friction is strongly rate dependent. Depending on the details of the rupture process, the final state of stress on the fault can be quite complex. This behavior is not universal, it depends on the degree of rate-dependence of friction...|$|R
