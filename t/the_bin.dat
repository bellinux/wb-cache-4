40|$|An {{intention}} of MapReduce Sets for Binning expressions analysis has to suggest criteria how Binning expressions in Binning {{data can be}} defined {{in a meaningful way}} and how they should be compared. Similitude based MapReduce Sets for Binning Expression Analysis and MapReduce Sets for Assignment is expected to adhere to fundamental principles of <b>the</b> scientific <b>Binning</b> process that are expressiveness of Binning models and reproducibility of their Binning inference. Binning expressions are assumed to be elements of a Binning expression space or Conjecture class and Binning data provide “information ” which of these Binning expressions should be used to interpret <b>the</b> <b>Binning</b> data. An inference <b>Binning</b> algorithm constructs <b>the</b> mapping between <b>Binning</b> data and Binning expressions, in particular by a Binning cost minimization process.

5000|$|Binary MSD radix sort, {{also called}} binary quicksort, can be {{implemented}} in-place by splitting the input array into two <b>bins</b> - <b>the</b> 0s <b>bin</b> and <b>the</b> 1s <b>bin.</b> <b>The</b> 0s <b>bin</b> is grown {{from the beginning of}} the array, whereas <b>the</b> 1s <b>bin</b> is grown from the end of the array. <b>The</b> 0s <b>bin</b> boundary is placed before the first array element. <b>The</b> 1s <b>bin</b> boundary is placed after the last array element. The most significant bit of the first array element is examined. If this bit is a 1, then the first element is swapped with the element in front of <b>the</b> 1s <b>bin</b> boundary (<b>the</b> last element of the array), and <b>the</b> 1s <b>bin</b> is grown by one element by decrementing the 1s boundary array index. If this bit is a 0, then the first element remains at its current location, and <b>the</b> 0s <b>bin</b> is grown by one element. The next array element examined is the one in front of <b>the</b> 0s <b>bin</b> boundary (i.e. <b>the</b> first element that is not in <b>the</b> 0s <b>bin</b> or <b>the</b> 1s <b>bin).</b> This process continues until <b>the</b> 0s <b>bin</b> and <b>the</b> 1s <b>bin</b> reach each other. <b>The</b> 0s <b>bin</b> and <b>the</b> 1s <b>bin</b> are then sorted recursively based on the next bit of each array element.

40|$|We {{show that}} using either {{the method of}} Page & Carrera or the {{well-known}} $ 1 /V_a$ method to construct <b>the</b> <b>binned</b> luminosity function (LF) of a flux limited sample of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) can produce an artificial flattening (or steepening {{in the case of}} negative evolution) of <b>the</b> <b>binned</b> LF for <b>bins</b> intersected by <b>the</b> flux cutoff of the sample. This effect is more pronounced for samples with steep and strongly evolving parent LFs but is still present even for non-evolving LFs. As a result of this distortion of the true LF, fitting a model LF to binned data may lead to errors in the estimation of the parameters and may even prompt the erroneous use of broken power law functions. We compute the expected positions of apparent breaks in <b>the</b> <b>binned</b> LF. We show that these spurious breaks in <b>the</b> <b>binned</b> LFs can be avoided if <b>the</b> <b>binning</b> is done in the flux [...] redshift plane instead of the typically used luminosity [...] redshift plane. <b>Binning</b> in <b>the</b> flux [...] redshift plane can be used in conjunction with <b>the</b> <b>binning</b> in <b>the</b> luminosity [...] redshift plane to test for real breaks in <b>the</b> <b>binned</b> LFs and to identify the features that are <b>the</b> result of <b>binning</b> biases.

40|$|Binning after volume {{production}} {{is a widely}} accepted technique to classify fabricated ICs into different clusters depending on different degrees of specification compliance. This allows the manufacturer to sell non optimal devices at lower rates, so adapting to customer’s quality-price requirements. <b>The</b> <b>binning</b> procedure {{can be carried out}} by measuring every single circuit performances, but this approach is costly and time consuming. On the contrary, if alternate measurements are used to characterize <b>the</b> <b>bins,</b> <b>the</b> procedure is considerably enhanced. In such a case, <b>the</b> specification <b>bin</b> boundaries become arbitrary shape regions due to the highly non linear mappings between the specifications space and the alternate measurements space. <b>The</b> <b>binning</b> strategy proposed in this work functions with the same efficiency regardless of these shapes. The digital encoding of <b>the</b> <b>bins</b> in <b>the</b> alternate measurements space using octrees is the key idea of the proposal. The strategy has two phases, the training phase and <b>the</b> <b>binning</b> phase. In <b>the</b> training phase, <b>the</b> specification <b>bins</b> are encoded using octrees. This first phase requires sufficient samples of each class to generate the octree under realistic variations, but it only needs to be performed once. <b>The</b> <b>binning</b> phase corresponds to <b>the</b> actual production <b>binning</b> of <b>the</b> fabricated ICs. This is achieved by evaluating the alternate measurements in the previously generated octree. <b>The</b> <b>binning</b> phase is fast due to the inherent sparsity of the octree data structure. In order to illustrate the proposal, the method has been applied to a band-pass Butterworth filter considering three specification bins as a proof of concept. Successful simulation results are reported showing considerable advantages as compared to a SVM based classifier. Similar bin misclassifications are obtained with both methods, 1. 68 % using octrees and 1. 83 % using SVM, while binning time is 5 X times faster using octrees than using the SVM based classifier.

When they ask Tiffany's mother Bianca (Patsy Palmer), Bianca invites them to Tiffany's party. The next day, Tiffany and Dotty lie so they do not have to go to school. Dotty takes Tiffany's bridesmaid's dress and MP3 player, after Tiffany does not allow her to try the dress on, and runs away with them, throwing the MP3 player into a bin. Dotty pushes Tiffany into <b>the</b> <b>bin</b> as she tries to retrieve it.

Dotty tells Dot she knows nothing about the dress but Dot then finds it in Dotty's school bag. Dot returns the dress to Bianca without Dotty's knowledge. The next day, Dotty is left alone with Dot's husband Jim (John Bardon) who is recovering from a stroke. She pours water on him to make it seem he has wet himself, but Dot catches her. Dotty says she hates them both and wishes that Nick had killed Dot. Dot smacks Dotty across the legs and Dotty manipulates her into letting her stay off school. After Dotty calls the police, Dot is arrested for assault but is released without charge and Dotty apologises.|$|E

Time freezes still and her husband becomes immobile; Clarkson, however, is immune to this. Looking around her house, she sees her younger self. Hand in hand, the younger and older versions of Clarkson relive her troubled childhood as various painful memories are seen, such as the younger Clarkson making a picture for her father who tosses it into the sink while talking on the phone, and Clarkson's mother making an unappreciated dinner for her father as she puts the father's dinner into <b>the</b> <b>bin.</b> These events drive her mother to the point of taking pills before closing the door in the younger Clarkson's face, so that she doesn't see her starting to cry. The breaking point is finally seen when Clarkson's parents have a physical fight and throw objects at each other. Soon after, Clarkson's father packs his bags and leaves despite the younger Clarkson's pleas for him to stay. The older Clarkson runs back in time to the present, and instead of fighting with her husband, they make up. They then see that their daughter in the video had seen them fight, and they embrace her and each other. Throughout the music video, Clarkson is shown singing on the front porch, her mother's bed and a room full of mirrors, reflecting an image of her younger self. Note that Kelly is holding Kennedy's hand in the scene where the childhood memories are revealed.|$|E

Abi goes to visit him but when Tanya discovers they have been seeing each other, she bans Abi from speaking to him. However, they eventually reunite. Abi, {{along with the rest of}} her family, are devastated to discover that when Max was away in Manchester, he married Kirsty Branning (Kierston Wareing). Abi meets her cousin Dexter Hartman (Khali Best), not knowing they are related, and this causes Jay to be jealous until the truth of their relationship is revealed. Tanya ejects Max from the family home after discovering he loves Kirsty. Abi loses her virginity to Jay much to her parents' disappointment. Abi tries to support Lauren with her drinking problem, however, this ends badly when Lauren destroys Abi's revision notes. Abi is distraught when Tanya leaves Walford with Lauren and Oscar as Lauren goes into a rehabilitation clinic in Exeter, so Max decides to move back in with her after Kirsty confesses that she has lied about being pregnant.
