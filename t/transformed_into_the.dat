During the war, the special police units lost 179 troops killed, 790 wounded and 14 missing.|$|E

5|$|The {{communist}} Polish United Workers' Party dissolved {{itself in}} 1990 and <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland. The Warsaw Pact was formally dissolved on 1 July 1991; the Soviet Union {{ceased to exist}} in December 1991 and the last post-Soviet troops left Poland in September 1993. On 27 October 1991, the first entirely free Polish parliamentary elections since the 1920s took place. This completed Poland's transition from a communist party rule to a Western-style liberal democratic political system.|$|E

5|$|A lighter {{alternative}} to the turret, particularly popular with the French navy, was the barbette. These were fixed armored towers which held a gun on a turntable. The crew was sheltered from direct fire, but vulnerable to plunging fire, for instance from shore emplacements. The barbette was lighter than the turret, needing less machinery and no roof armor—though nevertheless some barbettes were stripped of their armor plate to reduce the top-weight of their ships. The barbette became widely adopted in the 1880s, and {{with the addition of}} an armored 'gun-house', <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> turrets of the pre-Dreadnought battleships.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Soundwave assembles a newer, more {{powerful}} chassis for Megatron, {{using it to}} resurrect him. Megatron then challenges Starscream and his loyalists for leadership of the Decepticons, kills his soldiers, defeats him and frees the Combaticons. He then leads a full-scale assault on the Autobot stronghold {{in the ruins of}} Iacon, where the massive Decepticon Trypticon's remains are kept. Megatron and his soldiers invade the facility and he takes Trypticon's power core, the heart of a transformer. He informs Trypticon that he is not being rescued as he , but he congratulates him for destroying Iacon City and thousands more Autobots. Trypticon is then <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Nemesis, the Decepticon flagship.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} election, the Referendum Party renamed itself the Referendum Movement. Goldsmith had been {{suffering}} from pancreatic cancer, and had been warned that competing the election would shorten his life. Goldsmith died in Benahavis, Spain on 18 July 1997, and the party disbanded shortly after. Some of its members <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Democracy Movement, a pressure group {{closely associated with the}} former Conservative supporter and multi-millionaire businessman Paul Sykes. The Eurosceptic cause was weakened, however; with Blair's firmly pro-EU government in power, by 1998 the possibility of a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU was considered as distant as it had been in 1995.|$|E
5|$|The Coronation Bandstand {{was built}} by the cliff edge in 1903, {{at a cost of}} £350, to {{celebrate}} the coronation of King Edward VII. The following year, a group of French Ursuline nuns, who were banned from teaching in France, fled with some of their pupils to Westgate-on-Sea and established the Ursuline Convent School, which in 1995 was re-established as Ursuline College. In 1910, a Swiss-Gothic styled town hall was built. However, it was soon decided that the building could be put to better use, and in 1912, it was <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Town Hall Cinema. In 1932, it was renamed the Carlton Cinema.|$|E
5|$|The Council of People's Commissars (Sovnarkom) was {{established}} on 8 November 1917 by the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) Government.

The Council of People's Commissars published decrees and decisions that were binding throughout the Soviet Union.
