2500|$|Truffaut {{completed}} the editing of The Green Room in March 1978 {{and showed it}} to his trusted friends and co-workers, who immediately praised the film and called it one of his best films. Many wrote to him via letter, such as Isabelle Adjani who revealed that [...] "Of all your films it is the one that most moved me and spoke to me, along with Two English Girls. I felt good crying in your presence." [...] Alain Delon told Truffaut that [...] "The Green Room, along with Clément, Visconti and very few others, is part of my secret garden." [...] Éric Rohmer told him that [...] "I found your film deeply moving. I found you deeply moving in your film." [...] Antoine Vitez told Truffaut [...] "I haven't yet <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> emotion I felt on seeing The Green Room. What I see in it, deep down, is kindness, and that's what touches me most. Thank you for having included me in it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{warned the}} {{students}} not to delay contacting their families because the Court {{was going to}} write them promptly. Dean Greenough wrote to Roberts: [...] "The letter that I am sending to your father this morning, although it does not tell him everything, necessitates your telling him everything." [...] To Kenneth Day he wrote: [...] "It {{would be better for}} them to hear it from you than from me." [...] The Dean's letters about students who had committed no overt act explained the circumstances at length and provided he Court's rationale for expulsion in such cases: [...] "The acts in question are so unspeakably gross that the intimates of those who commit these acts become tainted." [...] He made a clear distinction by not criticizing such a student's character, but his judgment, calling him [...] "no worse than ignorant, over-curious, and careless." [...] When it came to those who had engaged in homosexual sex, Greenough withheld details yet tried to underscore the significance of the violation. To Roberts' father, Greenough wrote that his son [...] "has promised to tell you all about the matter, and I hope he will tell you the whole truth. His offense {{has nothing to do with}} low scholarship; it is not gambling, or drink or ordinary sexual intercourse. If he does not confess to something worse than these things, he will not have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> whole story." ...|$|E
