The mechanism of tubal damage as well as the rejection of an embryo may involve an initial immune sensitization to the CT 60 kD heat shock protein (HSP), followed by a reactivation of HSP-sensitized lymphocytes in response to the human HSP and the subsequent release of inflammatory cytokines.

40|$|The fallopian {{tubes are}} {{subjected}} {{to a variety of}} inflammatory and neoplastic lesions. Reactive changes secondary to inflammation may potentially mimic malignancy.

The tube is the most frequent site of an ectopic pregnancy but is rare for primary gestational trophoblastic diseases. The latter are usually secondary to a lesion from the corpus. Tubal hyperplasia is a poorly defined and overlapping entity; in many cases, they represent precursor lesions of tubal borderline or malignant lesions. Recent advances in genetic testing for BRCA mutations in high-risk families had led to the recognition of early carcinomas of the fallopian tube in prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimens. Tubal intraepithelial carcinoma has become the topic of vigorous research in recent years, and this lesion, particularly when found in the fimbriae, is now recognized as the source some ovarian and peritoneal high-grade serous carcinomas. Secondary involvement of the tubes by ovarian carcinomas or those of other sites is more common than primary tubal carcinomas.

The correlations between the general occurrence of ovarian cysts and the morphological state of epithelium of oviductal tunica mucosa were determined.

40|$|Abstract Background In women, Chlamydia (C.) trachomatis upper {{genital tract}} {{infection}} can cause distal <b>tubal</b> damage and <b>occlusion,</b> increasing {{the risk of}} tubal factor subfertility and ectopic pregnancy. Variations, like single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in immunologically important host genes are assumed {{to play a role}} in the course and outcome of a C. trachomatis infection. We studied whether genetic traits (carrying multiple SNPs in different genes) in the bacterial sensing system are associated with an aberrant immune response and subsequently with tubal pathology following a C. trachomatis infection. The genes studied all encode for pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) involved in sensing bacterial components. Methods Of 227 subfertile women, serum was available for C. trachomatis IgG antibody testing and genotyping (common versus rare allele) of the PRR genes TLR 9, TLR 4, CD 14 and CARD 15 /NOD 2. In all women, a laparoscopy was performed to assess the grade of tubal pathology. Tubal pathology was defined as extensive peri-adnexal adhesions and/or distal occlusion of at least one tube. Results Following a C. trachomatis infection (i. e. C. trachomatis IgG positive), subfertile women carrying two or more SNPs in C. trachomatis PRR genes were at increased risk of tubal pathology compared to women carrying less than two SNPs (73 % vs 33 % risk). The differences were not statistically significant (P = 0. 15), but a trend was observed. Conclusion Carrying multiple SNPs in C. trachomatis PRR genes tends to result in an aberrant immune response and a higher risk of tubal pathology following a C. trachomatis infection. Larger studies are needed to confirm our preliminary findings. </p...|$|R
50|$|The {{proximal}} tubal opening (ostium or os) {{is located}} within the uterus at the uterotubal junction and accessible via hysteroscopy. Occlusion at this opening {{is referred to as}} proximal <b>tubal</b> <b>occlusion.</b>|$|E
50|$|Essure {{sterilization}} is a <b>tubal</b> <b>occlusion</b> {{procedure that}} {{was approved by}} the FDA in 2002. The Essure procedure involves inserting a small camera (hysteroscope) through the cervix and into the uterine cavity. Two small, metallic coils are then inserted into each tubal ostia and into the isthmic portion of the fallopian tube. The coils cause the isthmic portion of the fallopian tube to be blocked with scar tissue. To confirm tubal closure, a hysterosalpingogram should be performed three months after the Essure procedure. If either fallopian tube is open after the Essure procedure, then the Essure procedure can be repeated or another type of <b>tubal</b> <b>occlusion</b> method can be performed.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 20% {{of female}} {{infertility}} {{can be attributed}} to tubal causes. Distal <b>tubal</b> <b>occlusion</b> (affecting the end towards the ovary) is typically associated with hydrosalpinx formation and often caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Pelvic adhesions may be associated with such an infection. In less severe forms, the fimbriae may be aggluntinated and damaged, but some patency may still be preserved. Midsegment tubal obstruction can be due to tubal ligation procedures as that part of the tube is a common target of sterilization interventions. Proximal <b>tubal</b> <b>occlusion</b> can occur after infection such as a septic abortion. Also, some tubal sterilization procedures such as the Essure procedure target the part of the tube that is near the uterus..|$|E
50|$|The distal tubal opening (or {{abdominal}} ostium) is {{the opening}} in the infundibulum of uterine tube into the abdominal cavity.

[...] Using catheters, an interventional radiologist or specifically trained radiographer can open tubes that are proximally occluded.|$|E
50|$|Adiana {{sterilization}} {{was approved}} by the FDA in 2009. Adiana sterilization is a hysteroscopic <b>tubal</b> <b>occlusion</b> procedure, which is very similar to Essure sterilization. The Adiana procedure involves inserting a small camera (hysteroscope) through the cervix and into the uterine cavity. A smaller catheter is inserted into the tubal ostia. The catheter emits radiowaves (microwaves). The radiowaves cause injury to the tubal lining and will result in the tube gradually closing. Prior to removal of the catheter a small silicone stent is left inside the isthmic portion of the tube and this promotes tubal closure by the acceleration of the tubal scarring.|$|E
50|$|Most {{commonly}} a tube may be obstructed due {{to infection}} such as {{pelvic inflammatory disease}} (PID). The rate of tubal infertility {{has been reported to}} be 12% after one, 23% after two, and 53% after three episodes of PID. The Fallopian tubes may also be occluded or disabled by endometritis, infections after childbirth and intraabdominal infections including appendicitis and peritonitis. The formation of adhesions may not necessarily block a fallopian tube, but render it dysfunctional by distorting or separating it from the ovary. It has been reported that women with distal <b>tubal</b> <b>occlusion</b> have a higher rate of HIV infection.|$|E

50|$|Different {{types of}} tuboplasty have been {{developed}} and can be applied by laparoscopy or laparotomy. They include lysis of adhesions, fimbrioplasty (repairing the fimbriated end of the tubes), salpinostomy (creating an opening for the tube), resection and reananstomosis (removing a piece of blocked tube and reuniting the remaining patent parts of the tube), and tubal reimplantation (reconnecting the tube to the uterus). Further, using fluoroscopy or hysteroscopy proximal <b>tubal</b> <b>occlusion</b> can be overcome by unilateral or bilateral selective tubal cannulation, a procedure where a thin catheter is advanced through the proximal portion of the fallopian tube os to examine and possibly restore tubal patency salpinostomy (creating an opening for the tube) or falloposcopy.|$|E
50|$|The typical {{method of}} tubal evaluation, hysterosalpingography, has {{shortcomings}} {{in terms of}} false negative and false positive results. It {{has been argued that}} falloposcopy allows for a more accurate evaluation of the tubal canal. Obstructions, adhesions within the tubal canal, and debris can be identified. The procedure allows removal of debris or filmy adhesions from within the fallopian tube, further in selected cases proximal tubal obstruction can be overcome and the tube can be recanalized allowing for pregnancy. Proximal <b>tubal</b> <b>occlusion</b> has also been overcome by using hysteroscopy with tubal canalization using a catheter, not a falloposcope. Extensive tubal obstruction, however, cannot be overcome by falloposcopy and would require tubal surgery or in vitro fertilization (IVF) to be overcome to achieve a pregnancy.|$|E
50|$|While a full {{testing of}} tubal {{functions}} {{in patients with}} infertility is not possible, testing of tubal patency is feasible. A hysterosalpingogram will demonstrate that tubes are open when the radioopaque dye spills into the abdominal cavity. Sonography can demonstrate tubal abnormalities such as a hydrosalpinx indicative of <b>tubal</b> <b>occlusion.</b> During surgery, typically laparoscopy, {{the status of the}} tubes can be inspected and a dye such as methylene blue can be injected in a process termed chromotubation into the uterus and shown to pass through the tubes when the cervix is occluded. Laparoscopic chromotubation has been described as the gold standard of tubal evaluation. As tubal disease is often related to Chlamydia infection, testing for Chlamydia antibodies has become a cost-effective screening device for tubal pathology.|$|E
5000|$|Rubin {{maintained}} a private practice and {{was interested in}} infertility. Realizing that many patients suffered from tubal obstruction, he developed tubal insufflation as a non-operative method to evaluate the tubes. The instrument {{is based on the}} principle that under a certain pressure, gas can be pushed via the cervix and uterus through the tubes into the abdominal cavity where its presence can be detected by distension and other means. In cases of nonpatency increasing pressure is exerted until a threshold level is reached. For his first experiments in 1919 he used oxygen, later he switched to carbon dioxide as this insufflation medium is quickly absorbed, less painful and safer. His instrument and technique were later supplemented with a kymograph to record the pressure readings. The Rubin test became a standard test to check the tubes in the investigation of causes of infertility and was claimed to be able to open up tubes in some patients with <b>tubal</b> <b>occlusion.</b> In 1958, Speert stated that [...] "many gynecologists regard it as the twentieth century's most important contribution to the clinical study of female infertility." [...] However, with the advancement of other techniques, notably laparoscopy, within the next two decades, the Rubin test lost its importance and it is not mentioned in contemporary textbooks.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we compare}} the {{prognostic}} significance of hysterosalpingography (HSG) and laparoscopy for fertility outcome. In a prospective cohort study in 11 clinics {{participating in the}} Canadian Infertility Treatment Evaluation Study (CITES), consecutive couples who registered between 1 April 1984 and 31 March 1987 {{for the evaluation of}} subfertility and who underwent HSG and laparoscopy were included. Unilateral and bilateral <b>tubal</b> <b>occlusion</b> at HSG and laparoscopy were related to treatment-independent pregnancy. Cox regression was used to calculate fecundity rate ratios (FRR). Of the 794 patients who were included, 114 (14 %) showed one-sided <b>tubal</b> <b>occlusion</b> and 194 (24 %) showed two-sided <b>tubal</b> <b>occlusion</b> on HSG. At laparoscopy, 94 (12 %) showed one-sided <b>tubal</b> <b>occlusion</b> and 96 (12 %) showed two-sided <b>tubal</b> <b>occlusion.</b> Occlusion detected on HSG and laparoscopy showed a moderate agreement beyond chance (weighted kappa-statistic 0. 42). The adjusted FRR of one-sided <b>tubal</b> <b>occlusion</b> at HSG was 0. 80, whereas two-sided <b>tubal</b> <b>occlusion</b> showed an FRR of 0. 49. For laparoscopy, the FRR were 0. 51 and 0. 15 respectively. After a normal or one-sided occluded HSG, laparoscopy showed two-sided occlusion in 5 % of the patients, and fertility prospects in these patients were virtually zero. If two-sided <b>tubal</b> <b>occlusion</b> was detected on HSG but not during laparoscopy, fertility prospects were slightly impaired. Fertility prospects after a two-sided occluded HSG were strongly impaired in cases where laparoscopy showed one-sided and two-sided occlusion, with FRR of 0. 38 and 0. 19 respectively. Although laparoscopy performed better than HSG as a predictor of future fertility, it should not be considered as the perfect test in the diagnosis of tubal pathology.

The study group consisted of 133 patients treated for unilateral <b>tubal</b> <b>occlusion</b> diagnosed by HSG during 2005 – 2011. The control group consisted of 570 patients with unexplained infertility treated during the same period. In all cases of the retrospective study, menstrual cycles were regular, basal serum follicle-stimulating hormone levels and sperm parameters were normal. Results: There were no significant differences in pregnancy rate per cycle between the study (17. 3 %) and control groups (18. 9 %). The pregnancy rate was higher in patients with proximal <b>tubal</b> <b>occlusion</b> (21. 7 %) compared with mid-distal <b>tubal</b> <b>occlusion</b> (12. 5 %) or unexplained infertility (18. 9 %), but the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Infertile patients with only unilateral proximal <b>tubal</b> <b>occlusion</b> detected on HSG can be treated initially by IUI combined with ovarian stimulation. The cycle outcomes in patients with proximal <b>tubal</b> <b>occlusion</b> are similar to patients with unexplained infertility.
