5|$|Solar panels produce {{direct current}} (DC) electricity, so solar parks need {{conversion}} equipment to convert this to alternating current (AC), {{which is the}} form transmitted by the electricity grid. This conversion is done by inverters. To maximise their efficiency, solar power plants also incorporate maximum power point trackers, either within the inverters or as separate units. <b>These</b> <b>devices</b> keep each solar array string close to its peak power point.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} electrical {{application of}} SiC was in lightning arresters in electric power systems. <b>These</b> <b>devices</b> must exhibit high resistance until the voltage across them reaches a certain threshold VT {{at which point}} their resistance must drop to a lower level and maintain this level until the applied voltage drops below VT.|$|E
5|$|The {{media of}} <b>these</b> <b>devices</b> were {{crystals}} with transition metal ion impurities, absorbing low-energy light and re-emitting {{it in the}} visible range.

5|$|Until the mid-15th century, organs had no stop controls. Each manual {{controlled}} ranks {{at multiple}} pitches, {{known as the}} Blockwerk. Around 1450, controls were designed that allowed {{the ranks of the}} Blockwerk to be played individually. <b>These</b> <b>devices</b> were the forerunners of modern stop actions. The higher-pitched ranks of the Blockwerk remained grouped together under a single stop control; these stops developed into mixtures.|$|E
5|$|A CO-oximeter {{can be used}} to {{determine}} carboxyhemoglobin levels. Pulse CO-oximeters estimate carboxyhemoglobin with a non-invasive finger clip similar to a pulse oximeter. <b>These</b> <b>devices</b> function by passing various wavelengths of light through the fingertip and measuring the light absorption of the different types of hemoglobin in the capillaries. The use of a regular pulse oximeter is not effective in the diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning as people with carbon monoxide poisoning may have a normal oxygen saturation level on a pulse oximeter. This is due to the carboxyhemoglobin being misrepresented as oxyhemoglobin.|$|E

The most sophisticated timekeeping astrolabes were the geared astrolabe mechanisms designed by Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī in the 11th century and by Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr in the 13th century. <b>These</b> <b>devices</b> functioned as timekeeping devices and also as calendars.|$|E
5|$|Digital {{forensics}} {{investigation is}} {{not restricted to}} retrieve data merely from the computer, as laws are breached by the criminals and small digital devices (e.g. tablets, smartphones, flash drives) are now extensively used. Some of <b>these</b> <b>devices</b> have volatile memory while some have non-volatile memory. Sufficient methodologies are available to retrieve data from volatile memory, however, there is lack of detailed methodology or a framework for data retrieval from non-volatile memory sources.

5|$|Heating is {{cost-effective}} at {{many more}} sites than electricity generation. At natural hot springs or geysers, {{water can be}} piped directly into radiators. In hot, dry ground, earth tubes or downhole heat exchangers can collect the heat. However, even {{in areas where the}} ground is colder than room temperature, heat can often be extracted with a geothermal heat pump more cost-effectively and cleanly than by conventional furnaces. <b>These</b> <b>devices</b> draw on much shallower and colder resources than traditional geothermal techniques. They frequently combine functions, including air conditioning, seasonal thermal energy storage, solar energy collection, and electric heating. Heat pumps can be used for space heating essentially anywhere.|$|E
40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks are edging {{closer to}} {{widespread}} feasibility with recent research showing promising results {{in developing and}} adapting new mechanisms to suit their environment.

This paper highlights some of the research challenges for extending secure communications over <b>these</b> resource-limited <b>devices</b> and points out why current protocols do not scale well in this unique application realm. A new key setup protocol (SEKEN) is proposed that neatly fits into the requirements of <b>these</b> <b>device</b> types. The performance of SEKEN is then analyzed against some other possible key setup mechanisms. Our initial results confirm that it performs better under most of the conditions anticipated for general wireless sensor networks...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to some strengthening, there were alterations {{to the air}} intake, which had throughout the P.1127 and Kestrel series featured an inflatable lip to smooth the intake airflow when the aircraft was almost stationary. There were concerns about the service life of <b>these</b> <b>devices,</b> so they were replaced with conventional suction relief doors. Experience gained during naval testing on board the commando carrier HMS Bulwark in 1966 convinced project officers that less reactive materials would be substituted for all uses of magnesium in the Kestrel's airframe, in any further prototypes and production aircraft. The Kestrel became the prototype for pre-production Harriers.|$|E
5|$|In the free-electron laser (FEL), a {{relativistic}} {{electron beam}} passes through a pair of undulators that contain arrays of dipole magnets whose fields point in alternating directions. The electrons emit synchrotron radiation that coherently interacts with the same electrons to strongly amplify the radiation field at the resonance frequency. FEL can emit a coherent high-brilliance electromagnetic radiation {{with a wide range}} of frequencies, from microwaves to soft X-rays. <b>These</b> <b>devices</b> are used in manufacturing, communication, and in medical applications, such as soft tissue surgery.|$|E
5|$|On December 7, 2016, Microsoft {{announced}} that {{as part of}} a partnership with Qualcomm, it planned to support the PC version of Windows 10 on Qualcomm Snapdragon systems-on-chip in 2017, beginning with a focus on laptops. Unlike Windows RT, <b>these</b> <b>devices</b> will support the use of an x86 processor emulator to support Win32 desktop applications, along with universal apps. On May 2, 2017, Microsoft unveiled Windows 10 S, an edition of Windows 10 designed for low-end mobile devices targeting the education market (which have led critics to compare the product line to Chrome OS). Similarly to Windows RT, it restricts software installation to applications obtained via Windows Store, but it may be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro for a fee to remove these restrictions.|$|E

5|$|Personnel {{experienced}} in direct laryngoscopy {{are not always}} immediately available in certain settings that require emergency tracheal intubation. For this reason, specialized devices {{have been designed to}} act as bridges to a definitive airway. Such devices include the laryngeal mask airway, cuffed oropharyngeal airway and the esophageal-tracheal combitube (Combitube). Other devices such as rigid stylets, the lightwand (a blind technique) and indirect fiberoptic rigid stylets, such as the Bullard scope, Upsher scope and the WuScope can also be used as alternatives to direct laryngoscopy. Each of <b>these</b> <b>devices</b> have its own unique set of benefits and drawbacks, and none of them is effective under all circumstances.|$|E
5|$|The July 26, 1977, USCG Marine Casualty Report {{suggested}} that the accident was caused by ineffective hatch closures. The report concluded that <b>these</b> <b>devices</b> failed to prevent waves from inundating the cargo hold. The flooding occurred gradually and probably imperceptibly throughout the final day, finally resulting in a fatal loss of buoyancy and stability. As a result, Fitzgerald plummeted to the bottom without warning. Video footage of the wreck site showed that most of her hatch clamps were in perfect condition. The USCG Marine board concluded that the few damaged clamps were probably the only ones fastened. As a result, ineffective hatch closure caused Fitzgerald to flood and founder.|$|E
5|$|USB {{mice and}} {{keyboards}} {{can usually be}} used with older computers that have PS/2 connectors {{with the aid of}} a small USB-to-PS/2 adapter. For mice and keyboards with dual-protocol support, an adaptor that contains no logic circuitry may be used: the hardware in the USB keyboard or mouse is designed to detect whether it is connected to a USB or PS/2 port, and communicate using the appropriate protocol. Converters also exist that connect PS/2 keyboards and mice (usually one of each) to a USB port. <b>These</b> <b>devices</b> present two HID endpoints to the system and use a microcontroller to perform bidirectional data translation between the two standards.|$|E
