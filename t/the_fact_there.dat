5|$|After 600, {{information}} on the Britons of Alt Clut becomes {{more common in the}} sources. In 642, led by Eugein son of Beli, they defeated the men of Dál Riata and killed Domnall Brecc, grandson of Áedán, at Strathcarron. The kingdom suffered a number of attacks from the Picts under Óengus, and later the Picts' Northumbrian allies between 744 and 756. They lost the region of Kyle in the south-west of modern Scotland to Northumbria, and the last attack may have forced the king Dumnagual III to submit to his neighbours. After this, little is heard of Alt Clut or its kings until Alt Clut was burnt and probably destroyed in 780, although by whom and what in what circumstances is not known, Historians have traditionally identified Alt Clut with the later Kingdom of Strathclyde, but J. E. Fraser points to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>there</b> is no contemporary evidence that the heartland of Alt Clut was in Clydesdale and the Kingdom of Strathclyde may have arisen after Alt Clut's decline.|$|E
5|$|While {{the number}} of losses {{incurred}} against German night fighters was not significantly large the psychological damage was substantial. A high number of crashes owed much to nervous British bomber pilots who did not feel safe over their own airfields and consequently landed too hard and fast or refused to go around a second time for fear of enemy intruders. Just as it appeared night intruder sorties were showing promise Adolf Hitler ordered a cessation of operations. For propaganda purposes, {{he thought that the}} morale of the German people would be better served by seeing British bombers destroyed and wrecked over German territory. Hitler was also reticent owing <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>there</b> had been no noticeable reduction in British air raids and the RAF had not adopted these methods during The Blitz. This order came into effect on 12 October 1941. Kammhuber would unsuccessfully lobby to have intruder operations reinstated and his efforts to expand the intruder force beyond a single unit were thwarted by an uninterested High Command which was inundated with requests for reinforcements in other theatres.|$|E
5|$|Many of the Allied airmen {{who were}} {{captured}} after being {{shot down over}} Japan were mistreated. On 8September 1944, the Cabinet of Japan directed that indiscriminate bombing constituted a war crime despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>there</b> was no international treaty or instrument protecting a civilian population specifically from attack by aircraft at the time. As a result, captured Allied airmen were subject to trial and possible execution although the rules of war stipulates that only soldiers who engaged in combat or carry out acts of sabotage or espionage wearing enemy uniforms or civilian clothes behind enemy lines can be punished. The frequency of such executions differed between military districts, however. While no airmen were executed in the Tōbu district (eastern Musashi), which included Tokyo, those captured in the Tōkai, Chūbu and Seibu (western Musashi) districts were sometimes killed after a brief trial or summarily executed by the Kempeitai ("Military Police Corps"). For instance, 33 American airmen were killed by IJA personnel at Fukuoka, including 15 who were beheaded shortly after the Japanese Government's intention to surrender was announced on 15 August. Mobs of civilians also killed several Allied airmen before the Japanese military arrived to take the men into custody. In addition to these killings, most captured B-29 crewmen were brutally interrogated by the Kempeitai.|$|E

25|$|Congestion grew in {{the city}} as both the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DLW) and the New York Central Railroad (NYC) had tracks that {{utilized}} city streets.

As of 2008, over 220 species of invasive insects have been identified, some of them considered pests. The situation is little better with vertebrates, as a 2004 report reported {{that there are two}} mammalian invasive species (the coypu and Indian palm squirrel), one fish species (mosquito fish), two reptilian species (the red-eared pond slider and the roughtail gecko) as well as 18 bird species. There are no amphibian invasive species, most likely due to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>there</b> are no suitable habitats for such.|$|E
25|$|The {{collapse}} of the Syrmian front in April 1945 accelerated the withdrawal of German forces, that were in retreat from the Balkans since October 1944. Like other Axis troops, forces of the NDH {{did not want to}} surrender to the Red Army or the Yugoslav Partisans and began retreating through Slovenia towards the Yugoslav-Austrian border, in order to surrender to the British forces advancing north from Italy. A large-scale exodus of people was planned and organized by the authorities of the NDH despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>there</b> was no strategic benefit to it: there simply was no viable destination for all the population to move to. On 3 May, the Slovene leadership also decided to retreat to Austria.|$|E
25|$|Workers {{must pay}} 12.4 percent, {{including}} a 6.2 percent employer contribution, on their wages below the Social Security Wage Base ($110,100 in 2012), but no {{tax on income}} in excess of this amount. Therefore, high earners pay a lower percentage of their total income because of the income caps; because of this, and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>there</b> is no tax on unearned income, social security taxes are often viewed as being regressive. However, benefits are adjusted to be significantly more progressive, even when accounting for differences in life expectancy. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, {{for people in the}} bottom fifth of the earnings distribution, the ratio of benefits to taxes is almost three times as high as it is for those in the top fifth.|$|E

500|$|For {{the next}} three days, the British entrenched and began laying siege lines to {{establish}} positions near the fort. [...] This work was complicated by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>there</b> was little diggable ground near the fort, and sandbags were required to protect the siege works. [...] During this time, the French gun batteries fired, at times quite heavily, on the British positions. [...] On July 25, a detachment of Rogers' Rangers launched some boats onto the lake north of the fort and cut a log boom the French had placed to prevent ships from moving further north on the lake. [...] By July 26, the British had pulled artillery to within [...] of the fort's walls.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the courts}} will {{generally}} avoid judicially reviewing errors of fact, a decision may be quashed if an error was made concerning a jurisdictional or precedent fact. A precedent fact error is made when a decision-maker {{comes to a}} conclusion {{in the absence of}} facts that must objectively exist, or in the presence of facts that must not exist, before it has the power of decision under legislation. If, say, the statute requires that a particular precedent fact must exist before the decision-maker may exercise the power conferred on it by the legislature, in the absence of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>there</b> can be no lawful exercise of the power. This is a specific type of simple ultra vires and the discretion involved can be described as being in the [...] "precedent fact category".|$|E
500|$|Hi-5, and {{the related}} {{television}} series, were designed by educational experts to appeal to contemporary, [...] "media-literate" [...] children by relating to their world. With the group being described as [...] "for the kids of today", Hi-5 has been seen to evolve with the times, updating music and designing new looks and costumes to stay [...] "abreast of the times". One of the unique features of Hi-5 is that the cast are presented as older siblings to the children, educating the audience in a fun and entertaining way, through [...] "play based learning", rather than appearing as adults who are teaching them. The educational aspects of the group's content are disguised with music and entertainment, with the multiple layers of the show catering {{to a wide range}} of ages in the audience, while being primarily aimed at those aged 2–8. Harris stated the group was careful about body-image issues, also believing Hi-5 helped to influence fashion in young people, and acknowledging it is acceptable to [...] "enjoy <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>there</b> are differences between boys and girls and men and women".|$|E

500|$|Notable for {{its absence}} is [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Lunch", from Dare to Be Stupid (1985), Yankovic's only {{previously}} released food-related song {{not to make}} the album. According to Yankovic, this is due to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>there</b> is a [...] "royalty ceiling" [...] on the albums and he needed to pick one song to cut from the list in order to turn a profit on the album. [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Lunch" [...] was chosen due to Yankovic's personal dislike of the song, as his record label had forced him to record it in order to release Dare to Be Stupid back in 1985. Also absent from the release is [...] "Waffle King." [...] The song had originally been recorded for Off the Deep End. However, Yankovic decided to swap [...] "Waffle King" [...] with [...] "I Was Only Kidding"—a song he had actually recorded for his next album—at the last minute; this forced Yankovic to shelve [...] "Waffle King" [...] for the time being. The song was later released on [...] "Smells Like Nirvana" [...] single, as well as Yankovic's eighth studio album, Alapalooza, which was released four months after The Food Album.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly named {{it as one}} of his favorite episodes of the series, calling it [...] "not only funny and moving, but incredibly important", both for its religious element and message of tolerance. Stack praised the performances by Colfer and O'Malley, as did USA Today Robert Bianco, who deemed the episode a [...] "smart, moving, musical exploration of the power and limits of faith and religion in a democratic society". Bianco commented positively on the way Colfer's singing was used to [...] "dig beneath the archness and anger in Kurt's behavior", calling it [...] "a textbook example of what music can add to drama." [...] Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald went further in his praise, deeming [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] "the perfect blend of music, characterization and plot - and easily the most provocative scripted hour in prime-time of the new season." [...] Perigard appreciated <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>there</b> were no easy answers presented, with no characters undergoing religious conversions {{during the course of the}} episode. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal felt that [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] succeeded in balancing opposing viewpoints, resulting in [...] "a nuanced, atypical episode of Glee that was both conflictingly emotional and confidently serious about the topic of religion", and Semigran similarly commended the episode's balance, writing that Falchuk [...] "covered both sides of controversial debate with grace, humor, and most importantly, respect." [...] In an article discussing Glee increasingly inconsistent tone, characterizations, and weird moments in the second season, film and television critic Matt Zoller Seitz cited [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] as an exception: [...] "an episode built around an earnest, Afterschool Special-style contemplation of faith that improbably turned out to be one of the series' boldest, silliest, maybe finest hours".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed {{over a number}} of afternoons at the end of 2007, with each day's filming {{beginning}} with a repeat of the last section from the previous day, to help blend each scene into the next. It was filmed with a [...] "single camera mentality" [...] but with up to five cameras running to give Brown a [...] "freedom of performance away from hitting marks or favouring one particular camera position." [...] This also helped in the case of technical problems, meaning that second takes were not necessary. Brown cried when she read the script and though she did not cry during fiming, she had expected to, planning to pause the tape recorder if she did. She stated that {{the most difficult part of}} the script was the line about Jim being [...] "here, but not here" [...] because she felt that way about Bardon. Arnold admitted to [...] " [...] away the tears" [...] many times and noted that several other crew cried, and that one of the toughest things about it was that it mirrored real-life events. Brown found the episode easy to film due to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>there</b> were no other cast members to make mistakes, and because she [...] "knew the character backwards" [...] and [...] "exactly how she'd behave and what she'd feel and [...] her history." [...] She praised Arnold and the crew, stating that the episode was [...] "lovely" [...] to make and she felt [...] "very fortunate to be given the opportunity." [...] The performance was edited in post production after being committed to tape, where usually all scenes are vision mixed, and the usual EastEnders theme tune was replaced at the end of the episode with Tony Jackson's [...] "Pretty Baby".|$|E
