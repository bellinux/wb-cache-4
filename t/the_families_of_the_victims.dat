5|$|In late April 2014, Connie {{performed}} {{a couple of}} concerts in South Korea (Osan and Seoul). These concerts, performed shortly after the horrendous Sewol ferry tragedy, were delivered with much personal consideration by Connie {{to make sure that}} all song choices were appropriate. Connie performed with yellow ribbons to show her respect for <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims.</b> The proceeds from at least one of the concerts were donated to the fundraising efforts in support of <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims.</b>|$|E
5|$|Comair {{discovered}} {{after the}} accident that all of its pilots had been using an airport map that did not accurately reflect changes made to the airport layout during ongoing construction work.

5|$|As {{the demonstrations}} continued, Ambassador Nolting managed to extract {{theoretical}} concessions from Diệm on 18 May. Diệm agreed a modest compensation package of USD $7000 for <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> as a conciliatory gesture. Diệm {{also agreed to}} dismiss {{those responsible for the}} shootings. However, the publicly stated reason for this action was that the officials had failed to maintain order, rather than that they had been {{responsible for the deaths of}} the protesters. Despite these concessions, Diệm maintained that his government was not responsible for the deaths, resolutely continuing to blame the Việt Cộng. It was enough to satisfy Nolting, who immediately departed for his vacation. His absence allowed the remaining American diplomatic staff led by William Trueheart, Nolting's deputy, to end Nolting's policy of appeasing Diệm.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, Sergei Khrushchev {{moved to}} the Donbas city of Yuzovka (now Donetsk, Ukraine); fourteen-year-old Nikita {{followed}} later that year, while Ksenia Khrushcheva and her daughter came after. Yuzovka, which was renamed Stalino in 1924 and Donetsk in 1961, {{was at the heart}} of one of the most industrialized areas of the Russian Empire. After the boy worked briefly in other fields, Khrushchev's parents found him a place as a metal fitter's apprentice. Upon completing that apprenticeship, the teenage Khrushchev was hired by a factory. He lost that job when he collected money for <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> of the Lena Goldfields Massacre, and was hired to mend underground equipment by a mine in nearby Rutchenkovo, where his father was the union organizer, and he helped distribute copies and organize public readings of Pravda. He later stated that he considered emigrating to the United States for better wages, but did not do so.|$|E
5|$|After the Huế Phật Đản shootings on May 8, {{civil unrest}} {{broke out in}} South Vietnam. Nine Buddhists were shot by the Roman Catholic regime of President Ngô Đình Diệm after defying a {{government}} ban on the flying of Buddhist flags on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha and marching in an anti-government protest. Following the shootings, Buddhist leaders began to lobby Diệm for religious equality and compensation and justice for <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims.</b> With Diệm remaining recalcitrant, the protests escalated. The self-immolation of Buddhist monk Thích Quảng Đức at a busy Saigon intersection became a public relations disaster for the Diệm regime, as photos of the event made front-page headlines worldwide and {{became a symbol of}} Diệm's policies. As protests continued, the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) Special Forces loyal to Diệm's brother Ngô Đình Nhu conducted the Xá Lợi Pagoda raids on August 21, leaving a death toll estimated to be up to several hundred and causing extensive damage under the declaration of martial law. Universities and high schools were closed amid mass pro-Buddhist protests. In the meantime, the fight against the Viet Cong insurgency had begun to lose intensity amid rumours of sectarian infighting amongst ARVN troops. This was compounded by the plotting of a coup by various ARVN officers, which distracted attention from the insurgency. After the pagoda raids, the Kennedy administration sent Cable 243 to the US Embassy, Saigon, ordering an exploration of alternative leadership possibilities.|$|E

2500|$|Once {{discussions with}} <b>the</b> <b>family</b> are {{complete}} and satisfactory {{information about the}} woman is acquired then <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> man will proceed to appoint marriage negotiators.

25|$|On May 10, 2006, State Prosecutor Randall White {{asked that}} Biechele {{be sentenced to}} ten years in prison, the maximum allowed under the plea bargain, citing the massive loss {{of life in the}} fire and the need to send a message.
