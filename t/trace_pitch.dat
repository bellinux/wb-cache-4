40|$|An {{intermediate}} solution between conventional {{printed circuit}} board technology and wafer level packaging, WLP, is to fabricate interconnection circuits and flip chip assembly structures on large glass substrates using LCD manufacturing equipment. Trace widths of 5 microns and a <b>trace</b> <b>pitch</b> of 10 microns are achievable on flexible substrates as large as 1800 x 1500 mm. Back planes for displays and keyboards can also utilize thin film transistors, TFTs, as developed for LCDs and enhanced for flexible assemblies (200 ºC processing). A flexible circuit is built on a glass carrier with an intermediate release layer. The carrier is discarded after all processing is complete, including interconnection circuits, IC chip assembly, test and rework. The assembly method uses gold stud bumps on IC chips, and corresponding wells filled with solder on the motherboard. 100 -micron pad pitch is achievable for IC chips, module cables, and test connections. Avoidance of epoxy under layers contributes to a robust capability for reworking defective IC chips. The methods are applicable {{to a wide range}} of products, from cell phones to blade servers. 1...|$|E

5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{in most of}} western and {{northern}} Norway (the so-called high-pitch dialects) accent 1 is falling, while accent 2 is rising in the first syllable and falling in the second syllable or somewhere around the syllable boundary.

40|$|International audienceThe decays of <b>pitch</b> <b>traces</b> and {{loudness}} traces {{in short-term}} auditory memory were compared in forced-choice discrimination experiments. The two stimuli presented on each trial {{were separated by}} a variable delay (D); they consisted of pure tones, series of resolved harmonics, or series of unresolved harmonics mixed with lowpass noise. A roving procedure was employed {{in order to minimize}} the influence of context coding. During an initial phase of each experiment, frequency and intensity discrimination thresholds [P(C) = 0. 80] were measured with an adaptive staircase method while D was fixed at 0. 5 s. The corresponding physical differences (in cents or dB) were then constantly presented at four values of D: 0. 5, 2, 5, and 10 s. In the case of intensity discrimination, performance (d') markedly decreased when D increased from 0. 5 to 2 s, but was not further reduced when D was longer. In the case of frequency discrimination, the decline of performance as a function of D was significantly less abrupt. This divergence suggests that pitch and loudness are processed in separate modules of auditory memory...|$|R
5000|$|By 1967, Brown's {{emerging}} sound {{had begun}} to be defined as funk music. That year he released what some critics cited as the first true funk song, [...] "Cold Sweat", which hit number-one on the R&B chart (Top 10 Pop) {{and became one of}} his first recordings to contain a drum break and also the first that featured a harmony that was reduced to a single chord. The instrumental arrangements on tracks such as [...] "Give It Up Or Turnit A Loose" [...] and [...] "Licking Stick-Licking Stick" [...] (both recorded in 1968) and [...] "Funky Drummer" [...] (recorded in 1969) featured a more developed version of Brown's mid-1960s style, with the horn section, guitars, bass and drums meshed together in intricate rhythmic patterns based on multiple interlocking riffs.Changes in Brown's style that started with [...] "Cold Sweat" [...] also established the musical foundation for Brown's later hits, such as [...] "I Got the Feelin'" [...] (1968) and [...] "Mother Popcorn" [...] (1969). By this time Brown's vocals frequently took the form of a kind of rhythmic declamation, not quite sung but not quite spoken, that only intermittently featured <b>traces</b> of <b>pitch</b> or melody. This would become a major influence on the techniques of rapping, which would come to maturity along with hip hop music in the coming decades. Brown's style of funk in the late 1960s was based on interlocking syncopated parts: struttin bass lines, syncopated drum patterns, and iconic percusive guitar riffs. The main guitar ostinatos for [...] "Ain't It Funky" [...] and [...] "Give It Up or Turn It Loose" [...] (both 1969), are examples of Brown's refinement of New Orleans funk; irresistibly danceable riffs, stripped down to their rhythmic essence. On both recordings the tonal structure is bare bones. The pattern of attack-points is the emphasis, not the pattern of pitches. It's as if the guitar is an African drum, or idiophone. Alexander Stewart states that this popular feel was passed along from [...] "New Orleans—through James Brown's music, to the popular music of the 1970s." [...] Those same tracks were later resurrected by countless hip-hop musicians from the 1970s onward. As a result, James Brown remains to this day the world's most sampled recording artist.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Intonation {{may serve}} as a cue for {{facilitated}} recognition and processing of spoken words and {{it has been suggested that}} the pitch contour of spoken words is implicitly remembered. Thus, using the repetition suppression (RS) effect of BOLD-fMRI signals, we tested whether the same spoken words are differentially processed in language and auditory brain areas depending on whether or not they retain an arbitrary intonation pattern. Experimental design: Words were presented repeatedly in three blocks for passive and active listening tasks. There were three prosodic conditions in each of which a different set of words was used and specific task-irrelevant intonation changes were applied: (i) All words presented in a set flat monotonous pitch contour (ii) Each word had an arbitrary pitch contour that was set throughout the three repetitions. (iii) Each word had a different arbitrary pitch contour in each of its repetition. Principal findings: The repeated presentations of words with a set pitch contour, resulted in robust behavioral priming effects as well as in significant RS of the BOLD signals in primary auditory cortex (BA 41), temporal areas (BA 21 22) bilaterally and in Broca’s area. However, changing the intonation of the same words on each successive repetition resulted in reduced behavioral priming and the abolition of RS effects. Conclusions: Intonation patterns are retained in memory even when the intonation is task-irrelevant. Implicit memory <b>traces</b> for the <b>pitch</b> contour of spoken words were reflected in facilitated neuronal processing in auditory and languag...|$|R
40|$|Assessments of body-segment angular {{movements}} {{are very important}} in the rehabilitation process. Head angular {{movements are}} measured and analyzed for use in studies of stability and posture. However, there is no methodology for assessing angular movements of the head, {{and it has not}} been verified whether data measured by fundamentally different MoCap systems will lead to the same results. In this study, we used a camera system and a 3 DOF orientation tracker placed on the subject’s head, and measured inclination (roll) and flexion (pitch) during quiet stance. The total length and the mean velocity of the <b>traces</b> of the <b>pitch</b> versus roll plots were used to measure and analyze head orientation. Using these methods, we are able to model the distribution of the measured 2 D data, and to evaluate stability and posture. The results show that the total lengths and the mean velocities related to the 3 DOF orientation tracker do not differ significantly from the total lengths and the mean velocities of traces related to the IR medical camera. We also found that the systems are not interchangeable, and that the same type of system must be used each time. The designed methods can be used for studies not only of head movements but also of movements of other segments of the human body, and can be used to compare other types of MoCap systems, depending on the requirements for a specific rehabilitation examination...|$|R

40|$|During {{a fire at}} the end of the 5 th century (about 490 - 500), {{among other}} buildings, a {{warehouse}} of the port of Classe was completely burnt. Inside there were different ceramic materials, such as lamps, amphorae, bowls and dishes, all coming from Africa, that remained in situ, thanks to the sudden event that destroyed the warehouse (building 17). The excavations were carried out during the years 2002 - 2005 by the University of Bologna and the Soprintendenza Archeologica of Emilia-Romagna. Among the amphorae recovered there were 200 Spatheia type 1 (Bonifay 2004, type 31) and about 180 wide cylindrical amphorae dated between the end of the 5 th and the first quarter of the 6 th century. In order to understand what these amphorae contained, chemical analysis of residues were carried out. Ten amphorae were selected to be analyzed (five spatheia and five cylindrical amphorae). All were sampled with a small drill and analyzed in collabor ation between the Archaeometric Laboratory and the Centro di Analisi e Determinazioni Strutturali of the University of Siena with spot tests and gas chromatography - mass spectrometry. The results of the analyses were surprising: regardless the form of the amphorae, some of the spatheia and of the cylindrical amphorae contained castor oil, and only two amphorae showed the markers of a possible different vegetable oil. No fish traces were present in either type of amphorae, suggesting that these spatheia were not used to transport it. Furthermore, all the amphorae showed resin or <b>pitch</b> <b>traces,</b> although almost all of them contained oil. These data point out several problems on the attribution of a specific content to amphorae types, and on the presence of an organic coating in oil containers. Furthermore, the presence of castor oil is quite interesting, as it is one of the first times that it was identified in ancient materials...|$|R
40|$|Quasi-periodic, short-period {{injections}} of relativistic electrons {{have been observed}} in both Jupiter’s and Saturn’s magnetospheres, but understanding their origin or significance has been challenging, primarily due to {{the limited number of}} in-situ observations of such events by past flyby missions. Here we present the first survey of such injections in an outer planetary magnetosphere using almost nine years of energetic charged particle and magnetic field measurements at Saturn. We focus on events with a characteristic period of about 60 – 70 min (QP 60, where QP stands for quasi-periodic). We find that the majority of QP 60, which are very common in the outer magnetosphere, map outside Titan’s orbit. QP 60 are also observed over a very wide range of local times and latitudes. A local time asymmetry in their distribution is the most striking feature, with QP 60 at dusk being between 5 and 25 times more frequent than at dawn. Field-line <b>tracing</b> and <b>pitch</b> angle distributions suggest that most events at dusk reside on closed field lines. They are distributed either near the magnetopause, or, {{in the case of the}} post-dusk (or pre-midnight) sector, up to about 30 RSRS inside it, along an area extending parallel to the dawn–dusk direction. QP 60 at dawn map either on open field lines and/or near the magnetopause. Both the asymmetries and varying mapping characteristics as a function of local time indicate that generation of QP 60 cannot be assigned to a single process. The locations of QP 60 seem to trace sites that reconnection is expected to take place. In that respect, the subset of events observed post-dusk and deep inside the magnetopause may be directly or indirectly linked to the Vasyliunas reconnection cycle, while magnetopause reconnection/Kelvin–Helmholtz (KH) instability could be invoked to explain all other events at the duskside. Using similar arguments, injections at the dawnside magnetosphere may result from solar-wind induced storms and/or magnetopause reconnection/KH-instability. Still, we cannot exclude that the apparent collocation of QP 60 with expected reconnection sites is coincidental. given also the large uncertainties in field line tracing with the available magnetic field models. The intensity of the QP 60 spectrum is strong enough such that if transport processes allow, these injections can be a very important source of energetic electrons for the inner saturnian magnetosphere or the heliosphere. We also observe that electrons in a QP 60 can be accelerated at least up to 6 MeV and that the distribution of QP 60 appears to trace well the aurora’s local time structure, an observation that may have implications about high-latitude electron acceleration and the connection of these events to auroral dynamics. Despite these new findings, it is still unclear what determines the rather well-defined 60 to 70 -min period of the electron bursts and how electrons can rapidly reach several MeV...|$|R
