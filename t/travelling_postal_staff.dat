50|$|At 5 am, Chief Superintendent Malcolm Fewtrell, {{head of the}} Buckinghamshire Police Criminal Investigation Department (CID), {{located at}} Aylesbury, arrived at the crime scene, where he {{supervised}} evidence-gathering. He then went to Cheddington railway station, where the train had been taken, and where statements {{were taken from the}} driver and postal workers. A member of the gang had made the mistake of telling the <b>postal</b> <b>staff</b> not to move for half an hour and this suggested to the police that their hide-out could not be more than 30 mi away. It appeared, from interviews with the witnesses, that about 15 hooded men dressed in blue boiler suits had been involved, but little more could be gleaned.|$|R
50|$|At around 4:09 am the Mail {{approached}} Tamworth {{at around}} 50 mph (85 kmh), the driver {{saw that the}} signal was set for the loop and applied the emergency brakes, but could not stop before being diverted onto the platform loop {{and then into the}} siding. The train had slowed down to about 15 mph when it hit the buffer stop {{at the end of the}} siding. The locomotive went through the buffers and crashed into the River Anker. A coach and a postal van overturned into the reservoir. The driver and fireman on the engine, and one passenger were killed. Thirteen other people were injured, including ten passengers, two <b>postal</b> <b>staff,</b> and a guard who was seriously injured.|$|R
50|$|The Shanghai Post Office {{controlled}} all post {{within the}} Settlement, but post coming in or {{going out of}} the treaty port was required {{to go through the}} Chinese Imperial Post Office. In 1922 the various foreign postal services, the Shanghai Post Office and the Chinese Post Office were all brought together into a single Chinese Post Office, thus extending the 1914 membership of the Chinese Post Office to the Universal Postal Union to Shanghai Post Office. Some other foreign countries refused to fall under this new postal service's remit, however: for many years, Japan was notable as sending almost all its mail to Shanghai in diplomatic bags, which could not be opened by <b>postal</b> <b>staff.</b>|$|R
50|$|The film {{utilizes}} three contrasting {{techniques to}} convey its meaning. First, Night Mail portrays the daily {{activities of the}} <b>postal</b> <b>staff</b> on a human scale, with colloquial speech and naturalistic vignettes, like sipping beer and sharing inside jokes. This was the approach favored by Harry Watt, who apprenticed under ethnographic filmmaker Robert Flaherty. Second, Night Mail uses expressionistic techniques like heavy back-lighting and the lyric poetry of Auden to convey the grand scale of the postal endeavor. These techniques were championed by Basil Wright, a lover of experimental European cinema. Finally, the film occasionally employs narration to explain the particular marvels of the mail system. This factual exposition was promoted by John Grierson.|$|R
5000|$|Fewtrell {{arrived at}} the scene of the crime at 5am and {{gathered}} evidence before taking statements from the driver and postal workers at Cheddington railway station. He established that about 15 hooded men in boiler suits were involved.

5000|$|Bavarian {{architect}} Robert Vorhoelzer {{belongs to}} the classical modernist school of architecture that is otherwise rather underrepresented in Bavaria. Most of his works were built when Vorhoelzer was Oberbaurat of the Bavarian postal administration. Together with Robert Poeverlein he founded the [...] "Bayerische Postbauschule". In {{the early stages of}} his work, such as at the post office Penzberg or the post office on Ismaninger Straße in Munich, the influence of the [...] "Heimatstil" [...] was dominant. But later Vorhoelzer built many modern and functional buildings (post offices, depots, apartment buildings for <b>postal</b> <b>staff</b> etc.) in the style of Neue Sachlichkeit. These include, for example, the post office on Tegernseer Landstraße ( [...] "Tela-Post") in Munich-Obergiesing, the post office building at Goethe Platz or the post office at Harras place in Munich-Sendling (1931-32), a white office building with a rotunda and high rise apartment blocks in the background. The harmonious integration of his buildings in the surrounding urban landscape proves Vorhoelzer's ability as a city planner. In particular, the appearance of the Arnulfstraße in Munich owns much to the numerous Vorhoelzer buildings.|$|R

By 1962 the HPD RE had moved from its premises on Gorst Road, Acton, to fully occupy Inglis Barracks. The Postal Depot’s main sorting facilities was established in an old munitions factory off Frith Lane and barrack buildings were given over to accommodate administration offices and sleeping quarters. On 31 October 1962, shortly after the occupation of the barracks by HPD RE, Her Royal Highness The Princess Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood, as the Controller Commandant Women's Royal Army Corps (WRAC) laid the foundation stone for extra barrack blocks [...] to be built within the site to accommodate 12 Company, WRAC. [...] The company provided <b>postal</b> <b>staff</b> employed in the Home Postal Depot and clerical staff, {{who worked in the}} various War Office (later Ministry of Defence) departments in London. Once the building works were completed the company was moved from their accommodation in Richmond Park, London to the barracks.|$|R
2500|$|The {{station was}} opened by the London and Birmingham Railway (L) as Harrow on 20 July 1837 {{in what was}} then rural Middlesex. At the time the station was built, the area was fields and the nearest large {{settlement}} was at Harrow on the Hill about [...] to the south. Wealdstone was a collection of houses {{at the north end of}} what is now Wealdstone High Street, about [...] north of the station. The station buildings on the south west (Harrow) side of the station are the older part of the station, located beside what were the fast lines until the platforms were used for the later Euston to Watford DC line and the main line tracks were re-routed through the previous slow line platforms and new platforms (numbers 5 and 6) to the north east; a new, larger, station building was also erected on this Wealdstone side of the station. The station footbridge was originally constructed with a full-height central barrier with passengers using the [...] "London" [...] side and railway and <b>postal</b> <b>staff</b> using the [...] "country" [...] side to move goods and mail via lifts which were removed in the early 1970s, leaving two parcels elevators serving the DC line platforms for the remaining postal traffic.|$|R

5|$|Mail {{service was}} chaotic during the stampede. Apart {{from the number}} of prospectors, two major {{obstacles}} stood in its way. To begin with, any mail from America to Dawson City was sent to Juneau in South-east Alaska before being sent through Dawson and then down the Yukon to Circle City. From here it was then distributed by the US Post Office back up to Dawson. The huge distances involved resulted in delays of several months and frequently the loss of protective envelopes and their addresses. The second problem was in Dawson itself, which initially lacked a post office and therefore relied on two stores and a saloon to act as informal delivery points. The NWMP were tasked to run the mail system by October 1897, but they were ill-trained to do so. Up to 5,700 letters might arrive in a single shipment, all of which had to be collected in person from the post office. This resulted in huge queues, with claimants lining up outside the office for up to three days. Those who had no time and could afford it would pay others to stand in line for them, preferably a woman since they were allowed to get ahead in line out of politeness. Postage stamps, like paper in general, were scarce and rationed to two per customer. By 1899, trained <b>postal</b> <b>staff</b> took over mail delivery and relieved the NWMP of this task.|$|R
5000|$|Appointment of Erich Honecker as head {{of state}} in 1971 was {{followed}} by a period of cultural liberalisation in the German Democratic Republic, and Rehfeldt, already an inveterate networker domestically, came into contact with the international Mail art movements through his association with Klaus Groh. [...] He quickly succeeded in building up an international network across East and West Europe that also took in the United States and Latin America, becoming n the process a contact point for members of the East German artistic community interested in finding {{what was going on in}} the wider world. [...] In addition he entered into correspondence based relationships with Nam June Paik, Wolf Vostell, Robert Filliou, Horst Tress and Dick Higgins. [...] In a country where approximately 90,000 items of mail were intercepted and inspected each day correspondence, especially overseas correspondence, involved a three-way relationship rather than a two way one. There was an occasion when Leo Duch asked Rehfeldt not to include propaganda material in his correspondence after Duch had encountered [...] "difficulties" [...] with the Brazilian authorities over the image of an East German flag accompanying a letter: it then transpired that whoever it was that had placed the flag image in the envelope, it had not been Rehfeldt. [...] Rehfeldt also experimented with creating rubber stamps that marked envelopes with long official sounding company names: he hoped these might have a usefully intimidating effect on the state <b>postal</b> <b>staff.</b>|$|R
50|$|With {{the passing}} of the Act of Union in 1800, {{creating}} the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, elected Irish members of the new United Kingdom Parliament sought the same quality of <b>travel</b> and <b>postal</b> facilities as their fellow members from England, Wales and Scotland. Improvements continued slowly, and by the time Thomas Telford had completed his A5 road with improvements through Shrewsbury, Llangollen, Betws-y-coed, Bangor and his Menai Suspension Bridge in 1826, the London to Holyhead journey was down to under 30 hours. The first steam packet boats had entered service between Holyhead and Dublin in 1819 and soon they were operating out of Liverpool as well.|$|R
50|$|The Grand Trunk Road in South Asia was {{the main}} road from modern day Bangladesh to {{northern}} Pakistan and Afghanistan.

After invading India over 1,500 years later, Mughals extended the Grand Trunk Road westwards from Lahore to Kabul (the capital of Afghanistan) crossing the Khyber Pass.

At one time, it extended to Kabul in Afghanistan, crossing the Khyber Pass and ran up to Kolkata and further to Bangladesh. The road was later improved by the British rulers of colonial India. It was renovated again to run from Calcutta to Peshawar (present-day Pakistan). Over the centuries, the road acted {{as one of the}} major trade routes in the region and facilitated both <b>travel</b> and <b>postal</b> communication. Since the era of Sher Shah Suri, the road was dotted with caravansarais at regular intervals, and trees were planted {{on both sides of the}} road to give shade to the travellers and merchants.

60|$|I succeeded, however, {{in getting}} the English district,--which {{could hardly have been}} refused to me,--and {{prepared}} to change our residence towards the end of 1859. At the time I was writing Castle Richmond, the novel which I had sold to Messrs. Chapman & Hall for 600. But there arose at this time a certain literary project which probably had a great effect upon my career. Whilst <b>travelling</b> on <b>postal</b> service abroad or riding over the rural districts in England, or arranging the mails in Ireland,--and such for the last eighteen years had now been my life,--I had no opportunity of becoming acquainted with the literary life in London. It was probably some feeling of this which had made me anxious to move my penates back to England. But even in Ireland, where I was still living in October, 1859, I had heard of the Cornhill Magazine, which was to come out on the 1st of January, 1860, under the editorship of Thackeray.|$|R
