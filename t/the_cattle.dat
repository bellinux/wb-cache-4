5|$|One species, <b>the</b> <b>cattle</b> egret, was {{historically}} an African bird. In the 20th century {{this bird}} colonized North America {{and is now}} found throughout the lower 48 states of the United States. <b>The</b> <b>cattle</b> egret is the only Old World bird to establish itself in North America in historical times without being introduced by humans. As such, it is not marked as introduced on this list. Neither is the glossy ibis, which probably had a similar history.|$|E

50|$|At {{the same}} time, Thomas Bates of Kirklevington and John Booth of Killesby were {{developing}} <b>the</b> Teeswater <b>cattle.</b> <b>The</b> Bates <b>cattle</b> were subsequently developed for their milking qualities, whereas <b>the</b> Booth <b>cattle</b> were developed for their beef qualities.

5|$|They {{descend from}} the Hamitic Longhorn, which {{were brought to}} Britain by Neolithic farmers in the second {{millennium}} BC, as <b>the</b> <b>cattle</b> migrated northwards through Africa and Europe.

5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>cattle</b> egret {{sometimes}} feeds {{in shallow}} water, unlike most herons it is typically found in fields and dry grassy habitats, reflecting its greater dietary reliance on terrestrial insects rather than aquatic prey.|$|E

5|$|In Australia, the {{colonisation}} {{began in}} the 1940s, with the species establishing itself {{in the north and}} east of the continent. It began to regularly visit New Zealand in the 1960s.

5|$|Kaleski's {{standard}} {{was adopted by}} breed clubs in Queensland and New South Wales and re-issued as their own, with local changes. His writings from the 1910s give an important insight into {{the early history of}} the breed. However, dog breeder and author Noreen Clark has noted that his opinions are sometimes just that, and he introduces some contradictory assertions in his later writings, as well as some assumptions that are illogical in the light of modern science. Some of these have persisted; for example he saw the red colour form as having more dingo in it than the blue form, and there is a persistent belief that reds are more vicious than blues. The most enduring of Kaleski's myths relate to Dalmatian and Kelpie infusions into the early Cattle Dog breed. These infusions are not referred to in Kaleski's writings until the 1920s and it seems likely that Kaleski sought to explain <b>the</b> <b>Cattle</b> Dog's mottled colouration and tan on legs by similarity to the Dalmatian and Kelpie, respectively. The genetics of coat colour, and the current understanding of hereditary characteristics, make the infusion of Dalmatian to increase <b>the</b> <b>cattle</b> dog's tolerance of horses an extremely unlikely event. There were relatively few motor vehicles in Australia {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, so most dogs of any breed would have been accustomed to horses. The Kelpie breed was developed after <b>the</b> <b>Cattle</b> Dog type was described, so its infusion is unlikely. It is possible that there was some infusion of Bull Terrier but there is no verifiable record of this, and <b>the</b> <b>Cattle</b> Dog has not had the Bull Terrier's instinct to bite and hold, which would have been an undesirable trait. Early in the 1900s there was considerable in-fighting amongst members of <b>the</b> <b>Cattle</b> Dog Club, and a series of arguments about the origin of the breed appeared in newspapers and journals of the time. While many of these arguments were misleading, some irrational, and the majority not supported by historical facts, they continue to be circulated, resulting in a number of theories on the origins of the breed. In recent years, information technology enabling the manipulation of large databases combined with advances in the understanding of canine genetics has allowed a clearer understanding of the development of the breed.|$|E

5|$|Not all {{interactions}} {{between humans and}} cattle egrets are beneficial. <b>The</b> <b>cattle</b> egret can be a safety hazard to aircraft due to its habit of feeding in large groups in the grassy verges of airports, {{and it has been}} implicated in the spread of animal infections such as heartwater, infectious bursal disease and possibly Newcastle disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{addition}} of the Grand Canyon Diorama in 1958 prompted changes to the Retlaw 2 freight train pulled by the DRR's No. 1 locomotive, which involved adding side-facing bench seating pointed towards Disneyland and red-and-white striped awnings on all of <b>the</b> <b>cattle</b> cars and gondolas. The walls on <b>the</b> <b>cattle</b> cars facing the park were also removed to allow for better views of the diorama. That same year, a third gondola with the same modifications as the other gondolas was added, and a fourth gondola with the same attributes was added in 1959. This brought {{the total number of}} freight cars in the train set, now referred to by Disneyland employees as Holiday Red, to eight. Prior to these modifications, <b>the</b> <b>cattle</b> cars and gondolas of this train set had no seating, requiring passengers to stand {{for the duration of the}} ride. Despite safety concerns voiced by Ward Kimball related to the lack of seats on these train cars, Walt Disney, for the purpose of authenticity, had insisted that there be no seats on them; he wanted the passengers to feel like cattle on an actual cattle train.|$|E

5|$|The {{massive and}} rapid {{expansion}} of <b>the</b> <b>cattle</b> egret's range is due to its relationship with humans and their domesticated animals. Originally adapted to a commensal relationship with large grazing and browsing animals, it was easily able to switch to domesticated cattle and horses. As the keeping of livestock spread throughout the world, <b>the</b> <b>cattle</b> egret was able to occupy otherwise empty niches. Many populations of cattle egrets are highly migratory and dispersive, and this has helped the species' range expansion. The species {{has been seen as}} a vagrant in various sub-Antarctic islands, including South Georgia, Marion Island, the South Sandwich Islands and the South Orkney Islands. A small flock of eight birds was also seen in Fiji in 2008.|$|E
5|$|A fold of semi-wild Highland cattle was studied, over {{a period}} of 4 years. It was found that <b>the</b> <b>cattle</b> have a clear {{structure}} and hierarchy of dominance, which reduced aggression. Social standing depended on age and sex, with older cattle being dominant to calves and younger ones and males dominant to females. Young bulls would dominate adult cows when they reached around 2 years of age. Calves from the top ranking cow were given higher social status, despite minimal intervention from their mother. Playfighting, licking and mounting were seen as friendly contact.|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{the authors}} {{report on the}} {{experiences}} of six years of foraging, describing how the fruit wastes generated in the Pannonhalmi Pálinkárium are utilized for foraging Hungarian grey <b>cattle.</b> <b>The</b> goal is not the control or improvement of <b>the</b> <b>cattle’s</b> growth indices but the problem-free, continuous and eco-friendly disposal of the fruit waste. They {{have found that the}} fruit waste or pomace is virtually nothing else than protein-enriched sugar-free fruit, and that during the utilization of this they have to maximally adapt to <b>the</b> <b>cattle’s</b> life-cycle, biological nature and environmental factors, and they will repay you by eating the pomace. They conclude that <b>the</b> grey <b>cattle</b> are a skin-and-hairs-covered bioreactor, which provides an economical service for the distillery through the utilization of the fruit waste. Nowadays, 150, 000 - 200, 000 tons of fruit waste is produced every year, and only a few percent of this is utilized in ruminant forage.

5|$|Butchers, slaughterers, surgeons, and {{physicians}} were suspected {{because of the}} manner of the mutilations. A surviving note from Major Henry Smith, Acting Commissioner of the City Police, indicates that the alibis were investigated of local butchers and slaughterers, with the result that they were eliminated from the inquiry. A report from Inspector Swanson to the Home Office confirms that 76 butchers and slaughterers were visited, and that the inquiry encompassed all their employees for the previous six months. Some contemporary figures, including Queen Victoria, thought the pattern of the murders indicated that the culprit was a butcher or cattle drover on one of <b>the</b> <b>cattle</b> boats that plied between London and mainland Europe. Whitechapel was close to the London Docks, and usually such boats docked on Thursday or Friday and departed on Saturday or Sunday. <b>The</b> <b>cattle</b> boats were examined but the dates of the murders did not coincide with a single boat's movements and the transfer of a crewman between boats was also ruled out.|$|E
