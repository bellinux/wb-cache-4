Commonwealth membership was held to have lapsed until 1997, after discriminatory provisions in the republican constitution were repealed and reapplication for membership made. Fiji has since been suspended twice, with the first imposed from 6 June 2000 to 20 December 2001 after another coup. Fiji was suspended yet again in December 2006, following the most recent coup. At first, the suspension applied only to membership on the Councils of the Commonwealth. After failing to meet a Commonwealth deadline for setting a date for national elections by 2010, Fiji was [...] "fully suspended" [...] on 1 September 2009. The Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, Kamalesh Sharma, confirmed that full suspension meant that Fiji would be excluded from Commonwealth meetings, sporting events and the <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programme</b> (with an exception for assistance in re-establishing democracy). Sharma stated that Fiji would remain {{a member of the}} Commonwealth during its suspension, but would be excluded from emblematic representation by the secretariat. On 19 March 2014 [...] Fiji's full suspension was amended to a suspension from councils of the Commonwealth by the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, permitting Fiji to join a number of Commonwealth activities, including the Commonwealth Games. [...] Fiji's suspension was lifted in September 2014. The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group fully reinstated Fiji as a member following elections in September 2014.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} a study of town {{twinning}} in Britain since 1945 to engage with narratives of ‘the new localism’ and ‘the new politics of scale’.

Town twinning plays an active yet overlooked role in fast policy. The paper also argues that town twinning is part of a longer history of bottom-up localism that includes the political arguments of John Stuart Mill, at least two moments of twentieth-century municipal internationalism, the municipal foreign policy movement of the 1980 s, and the community development movement of the last three decades. This longer history suggests sources of localism other than statecraft, and problematises the conceptualisation of power and periodisation of history found in regulation theories of devolution...|$|R
40|$|Re-construction and {{development}} projects {{in developing countries}} are almost synonymous. Due to the high vulnerability of developing countries, development projects are often severely affected by natural and human-made disasters. The reconstruction efforts take long periods often for the very project to be destroyed by the next disaster before completion of the reconstruction process. As almost the entire effort by the various governments is lost in the re-construction works rather than new development, tangible development may not be realized. We discuss the practices of various methods of resource mobilization in developing countries for reconstruction {{and development}} by using Kenya as a case study. We discuss the practice of conventional resource mobilization approaches through loans, grants, appropriation-in-aid, and the practices of disbursement institutions such as World Bank and its affiliates in developing countries. We analyse the emerging indigenous approaches in resource mobilization including merry-go-round, the “harambee ” system of resource mobilization and the community-work for development programmes in re-construction projects.
