5|$|In March 1782, 160 Pennsylvania militiamen under Lieutenant Colonel David Williamson rode {{into the}} Ohio Country, {{hoping to find}} the warriors who were {{responsible}} for raids against Pennsylvania settlers. Enraged by <b>the</b> <b>gruesome</b> murder by Indians of a white woman and her baby, Williamson's men detained about 100 Christian Delawares at the village of Gnadenhütten. The Christian Delawares (mostly women and children) had returned to Gnadenhütten from Captive Town in order to harvest the crops they {{had been forced to}} leave behind. Accusing the Christian Indians of having aided hostile raiding parties, the Pennsylvanians murdered them all by hammer blows to the head. The Gnadenhutten massacre, as it came to be called, would have serious repercussions for the next American expedition into the Ohio Country.|$|E
5|$|Le Père Goriot is also {{recognized}} as a bildungsroman, wherein a naive young person matures while learning {{the ways of the}} world. Rastignac is tutored by Vautrin, Madame de Beauséant, Goriot, and others about the truth of Parisian society and the coldly dispassionate and brutally realistic strategies required for social success. As an everyman, he is initially repulsed by <b>the</b> <b>gruesome</b> realities beneath society's gilded surfaces; eventually, however, he embraces them. Setting aside his original goal of mastering the law, he pursues money and women as instruments for social climbing. In some ways this mirrors Balzac's own social education, reflecting the distaste he acquired for the law after studying it for three years.|$|E
5|$|While Massive Dynamic {{offers its}} {{computing}} resources to identify possible buildings of similar mass, Walter implores Olivia (Anna Torv) to recall her childhood Cortexiphan-induced {{ability to see}} objects from the alternate universe, believing she {{will be able to}} foresee which building will be affected and warn everyone in time. He takes her to the disused child-care facility in Jacksonville, Florida, where the Cortexiphan trials were performed. Walter first puts Olivia under heavy sedation, and she experiences meeting her younger, frightened self, but is still unable to trigger her ability. Olivia begins to remember <b>the</b> <b>gruesome</b> trials she experienced, including footage from one test where she exhibited pyrokinesis. As Walter's deadline nears, he realizes that Olivia is no longer frightened and thus she cannot engage her abilities, which were triggered by fear.|$|E

5|$|In Kansas City, Kansas, two {{religious}} missionaries visit {{two women}} at two different {{homes in the}} same neighborhood who look exactly alike. The second woman yells at them to go away and the two men, inexplicably, get into a fight in the second woman's front yard. Later, two FBI agents who look and sound remarkably similar to Mulder and Scully visit the first woman, Betty Templeton (Kathy Griffin). Betty claims to have never seen the other woman before. The other woman then passes her by in a car and the two agents begin fighting each other, much like the missionaries. They are severely injured after <b>the</b> <b>gruesome</b> mauling. Both agents, who had worked together for seven years, said that they were possessed. Meanwhile, the other woman, Lulu Pfeiffer (also Kathy Griffin), applies for a job at Koko's Copies, but does not get it because she has had 17 jobs in 17 states {{in the past three years}} and moves around too much. She becomes aggravated and suddenly, all the copies become black. The other woman, Betty, goes to another job with the same name and same resume.|$|E
25|$|About a {{year after}} <b>the</b> <b>gruesome</b> end of his first {{marriage}} Gesualdo's father died and he thus became the third Prince of Venosa and eighth Count of Conza.|$|E
25|$|Families of {{the victims}} had varied {{reactions}} to this announcement. Some were disappointed that Pickton would never be convicted of the 20 other murders, while others were relieved that <b>the</b> <b>gruesome</b> details of the murders would not be aired in court.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Gruesomes</b> are {{replaced}} in later spin-off series by The Frankenstones, another monster-themed family who move {{next door to}} the Flintstones.|$|R
5000|$|In late 1999, <b>the</b> <b>Gruesomes</b> {{reformed}} {{to coincide}} with the release of a new album, Cave-In!. A 14-track CD was released in Canada, whilst the album was sold as a 12" [...] vinyl record in Germany. The tour to support Cave-In! was primarily driven by popular demand and resulted in the band playing shows in Germany and Amsterdam. <b>The</b> <b>Gruesomes</b> continued to gig in Canada and the US, including performances at Cave Stomp and Sundazed in New York City, New York, US.|$|R
5000|$|Famous {{for their}} wild stage presence, <b>the</b> <b>Gruesomes</b> toured Canada and the US {{accompanied}} by a reputation for legendary live shows. Always taking an [...] approach to music, <b>the</b> <b>Gruesomes</b> were known for their humor and goofy stage antics. Their famous Halloween shows were schlock tributes to horror themes, incorporating camp props such as coffins and Dracula capes. In 1987, following the release of Gruesomania, Ottawa's John Knoll replaced Eric Davis on drums and the band subsequently wrote music that sounded more like R&B than garage punk.|$|R
25|$|Andrew Holmes's {{attorneys}} argued {{they were}} constrained in defending {{him by the}} Army’s decision to conceal photos of the man he had allegedly shot in January. The National Institute of Military Justice argued that <b>the</b> <b>gruesome</b> corpse photos should be made public.|$|E
25|$|A granduncle was George Parkman (1790—1849), {{a murder}} victim {{in a highly}} publicized case that shook the city of Boston to its core in 1849—1850, due to <b>the</b> <b>gruesome</b> nature of the crime and the high social station of both the victim and the murderer.|$|E
25|$|Jayamkondar's masterpiece, Kalingattuparani, is {{an example}} of {{narrative}} poetry that draws a clear boundary between history and fictitious conventions. This describes the events during Kulothunga Chola I's war in Kalinga and depicts not only the pomp and circumstance of war, but <b>the</b> <b>gruesome</b> details of the field. The Tamil poet Ottakuttan was a contemporary of Kulothunga CholaI and served at the courts of three of Kulothunga's successors. Ottakuttan wrote Kulothunga Cholan Ula, a poem extolling the virtues of the Chola king.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Gruesomes</b> are {{a family}} {{consisting}} of married couple Weirdly and Creepella, {{and their son}} Goblin (Gobby for short). Also living with <b>the</b> <b>Gruesomes</b> is Uncle Ghastly who is only seen as a hand and a shadow in [...] "Meet the Gruesomes" [...] and a hand coming from a well (that punches Fred Flintstone in the face) in [...] "The Hatrocks and the Gruesomes" [...] (he is also heard for the only time as a terrifying and creepy laugh in [...] "The Hatrocks and the Gruesomes").|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Gruesomes</b> {{released}} two music videos: 1987's [...] "Way Down Below" [...] and 1988's Monkees-inspired, [...] "Hey!". Both clips received heavy rotation on Canada's video station MuchMusic.|$|R

25|$|The film {{revolves}} around a Tamil Indian doctor who, two {{weeks prior to}} his wedding, goes to Russia for a conference pertaining to his occupation, that of a doctor. While in Russia he struggles {{to cope with the}} language because of the Russian reluctance to speak English, and eventually, due to <b>the</b> <b>gruesome</b> murder of a local woman, he gets imprisoned. How the doctor manages to get himself out of jail in order to get married to his lady love in India, {{with the help of an}} Indian female lawyer, forms the crux of the story.|$|E
25|$|In March 1782, 160 Pennsylvania militiamen under Lieutenant Colonel David Williamson rode {{into the}} Ohio Country, {{hoping to find}} the Indian warriors who were {{responsible}} for ongoing raids against Pennsylvania settlers. Enraged by <b>the</b> <b>gruesome</b> murder by Indians of a white woman and her baby, Williamson's men detained about 100 Christian Delawares at the village of Gnadenhütten.

25|$|The story {{continues}} with King Herod asking his advisers about ancient prophesies describing {{the birth of}} such a child. As {{a result of their}} advice, he sends soldiers to kill every boy child under the age of two in the city of Bethlehem. But Joseph has been warned in a dream, and flees to Egypt with Mary and the baby, Jesus. <b>The</b> <b>gruesome</b> scene of the Massacre of the Innocents, as the murder of the babies is generally referred, was particularly depicted by Early Renaissance and Baroque painters. The Flight into Egypt was another popular subject, showing Mary with the baby on a donkey, led by Joseph (borrowing the older iconography of the rare Byzantine Journey to Bethlehem).|$|E
5000|$|Monster Shindig, {{in which}} Snooper and Blabber {{are called to}} {{investigate}} a loud party, which is being thrown by <b>The</b> <b>Gruesomes.</b> Paul Frees voiced Snooper and June Foray voiced Blabber on this record.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Gruesomes</b> ceased {{operation}} as a band in 1990 and it {{is reported}} that the members believed that they had achieved {{the highest level of}} success that was possible for an underground musical act.|$|R
5000|$|The family reappears in {{the episode}} [...] "The Hatrocks and the Gruesomes". The Hatrocks, who are hillbilly friends of Fred, {{come to visit}} but soon become an {{annoyance}} to everyone. Fred enlists <b>the</b> <b>Gruesomes</b> to scare them away, but they are unsuccessful, because the Hatrocks are immune to horror. Fred finally discovers The Hatrocks' aversion to [...] "bug music" [...] played by a band called the Four Insects and uses it to chase {{them back to the}} hills. This episode features the Flintstones, the Rubbles, and <b>the</b> <b>Gruesomes</b> all singing [...] "She Said Yeah Yeah Yeah", a parody of the Beatles' song [...] "She Loves You".|$|R
25|$|Soon {{after the}} {{conclusion}} of the Salt sathyagraha at Dandi, Gandhi intended to lead a pack of sathyagrahis to the Dharasana Salt Works in Gujarat, but was arrested by the police. A few days later, Congress leader Abbas Tyabji was also arrested. So the mantle fell upon Sarojini Naidu to lead the sathyagrahis at Dharasana. The sathyagrahis marched to Dharasana, where they were stopped by a deportment of the police. The non-violent sathyagrahis proceed to confront the police and were beaten down. American journalist Webb Miller, who witnessed <b>the</b> <b>gruesome</b> scene, counted around 320 bodies. Miller's reporting of the violence at the Dharasana Salt Works was later credited for helping turn world opinion against British colonial rule of India.|$|E
25|$|More than a {{year after}} Carr's {{conviction}} for the murder of Heather Strong, her co-defendant Joshua Fulgham went on trial for his alleged participation in the murder in April 2012. Carr, on death row at the Lowell Correctional Institution Annex, would not testify at the trial. The prosecution detailed <b>the</b> <b>gruesome</b> aspects of the crime. Both the prosecution and Fulgham's defense attorneys agreed that the motives for Heather Strong's murder were jealousy and betrayal. At the conclusion of his trial, Fulgham was convicted of first-degree murder and kidnapping. Despite the death sentence of his co-defendant, Joshua's jury voted 8-to-4 to sentence him to life in prison without a chance of parole and the judge followed the jury's recommendation.|$|E
25|$|Previously {{the reader}} had been {{cushioned}} from experiencing the full horror of events, {{but in the}} final section, the events are laid bare. The horror begins with {{the attack on the}} undefended Italian mountain village, with the following chapters involving despair (Doc Daneeka and the Chaplain), disappearance in combat (Orr and Clevinger), disappearance caused by the army (Dunbar) or death of most of Yossarian's friends (Nately, McWatt, Mudd, Kid Sampson, Dobbs, Chief White Halfoat and Hungry Joe), culminating in the unspeakable horrors of Chapter 39, in particular the rape and murder of Michaela, who represents pure innocence. In Chapter 41 the full details of <b>the</b> <b>gruesome</b> death of Snowden are finally revealed.|$|E
50|$|A second {{version of}} the Evil Scientist family named <b>The</b> <b>Gruesomes</b> {{appeared}} as <b>The</b> Flintstones' next-door neighbors. A third incarnation of the family, which combined elements of both the Evil Scientists and <b>Gruesomes,</b> named <b>The</b> Creepleys appeared on Laff-A-Lympics.|$|R
50|$|In 1977, {{a family}} similar to <b>the</b> <b>Gruesomes</b> were {{introduced}} {{as part of}} the Laff-A-Lympics segment on Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics. The Creepleys consist of Mr. Creepley, Mrs. Creepley, and their son Junior Creepley. They are members of the Really Rottens team.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Gruesomes</b> {{appear in}} two {{different}} comic books. They first appear in The Flintstones #24 (published in 1965 by Gold Key Comics), and then had their own back-up feature in Cave Kids (a series starring young versions of the Flintstones, similar to the later Flintstone Kids animated series).|$|R
25|$|La Comédie de la Mort, {{published}} in 1838, {{is a period}} piece much like Albertus. In this work, Gautier focuses {{on the theme of}} death, which for Gautier is a terrifying, stifling and irreversible finality. Unlike many Romantics before him, Gautier's vision of death is solemn and portentous, proclaiming death as the definitive escape from life's torture. During the time he wrote the work, Gautier was frequenting many cemeteries, which were then expanding rapidly to accommodate the many deaths from epidemics that swept the country. Gautier translates death into a curiously heady, voluptuous, almost exhilarating experience which diverts him momentarily from <b>the</b> <b>gruesome</b> reality and conveys his urgent plea for light over darkness, life over death. Several of these poems have been set as melodies by composers such as Berlioz, Bizet, Fauré, and Duparc.|$|E
25|$|The {{dead bodies}} were so {{numerous}} that burying {{all of them}} was impossible. The dead were initially weighted down on barges and dumped at sea, but when the gulf currents washed many of the bodies back onto the beach, a new solution was needed. Funeral pyres were {{set up on the}} beaches, or wherever dead bodies were found, and burned day and night for several weeks after the storm. The authorities passed out free whiskey to sustain the distraught men conscripted for <b>the</b> <b>gruesome</b> work of collecting and burning the dead. More people were killed in this single storm than the total of those killed in all the tropical cyclones that have struck the United States since. This count is greater than 300 cyclones, as of 2009. The Galveston Hurricane of 1900 remains the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history.|$|E
25|$|Xiang Yu is {{depicted}} as a ruthless leader, {{in sharp contrast to}} his rival, Liu Bang. He was a mass murderer, ordering the massacres of entire cities when they refused to surrender and put up strong resistance. The most notorious example of his cruelty was when he ordered the 200,000 surrendered Qin troops to be buried alive after the Battle of Julu, and <b>the</b> <b>gruesome</b> methods of execution he employed against his enemies and critics. Conversely, Liu Bang is portrayed as a shrewd and cunning ruler who can be brutal at times. However, Liu Bang forbade his troops from looting the cities they captured and he spared the lives of the citizens, earning their support and trust in return. Xiang Yu's story became an example for Confucianists to advocate the idea that leaders should rule with benevolence and not govern by instilling fear in the people. However, his ambitions ended with the collapse of Western Chu, his defeat by Liu Bang, and his death at the early age of around 30.|$|E
5000|$|With no {{previous}} musical experience, Bobby Beaton (guitar and vocals), Gerry Alvarez (guitar and vocals), John Davis (bass) and Davis' brother, Eric Davis (drums), were all {{between the ages}} of 16 and 19 when they began playing music together. It has been reported that the four teenagers were primarily inspired by long nights spent in their parents' basement watching TV and listening to obscure mid-60s records. Taking their name from the scary neighbours on TV's <b>The</b> Flintstones, <b>the</b> <b>Gruesomes</b> developed an image of matching black turtlenecks, Beatle boots and bowl haircuts, combining it with a [...] "snotty" [...] punk musical style. Early live shows relied more on the group's energy and humour than actual musical ability; however, <b>the</b> <b>Gruesomes</b> proceeded to become a popular club act, despite their inexperience.|$|R
50|$|Next {{door to the}} Flintstone {{residence}} was Tombstone Manor, home to <b>the</b> <b>Gruesomes,</b> {{who were}} parodies of the Addams Family: Weirdly, Creepella, and their son, Goblin (a.k.a. Gobby), {{as well as a}} strange assortment of relatives and pets. Later spinoffs would introduce the Frankenstones, similar monster-themed neighbors of the Flintstones.|$|R
60|$|That {{question}} linked <b>the</b> dark, <b>gruesome,</b> fantastic nightmare on to actuality.|$|R
