The completely randomised design of turned and force-aerated piles was performed in triplicate. The composting activity of both systems during the composting period was measured by several parameters: temperature, pH, moisture content, C/N ratio, growth of microorganisms, cellulase activity, and nicotine degradation in the set-up piles.

Previously, a fused pathway of the pyridine pathway and the pyrrolidine pathway was proposed for nicotine degradation by Agrobacterium tumefaciens S 33, in which 6 -hydroxy- 3 -succinoylpyridine (HSP) is a key intermediate connecting the two pathways. We report here the purification and properties of an NADH-dependent HSP hydroxylase from A. tumefaciens S 33. The 90 -kDa homodimeric flavoprotein catalyzed the oxidative decarboxylation of HSP to 2, 5 -dihydroxypyridine (2, 5 -DHP) {{in the presence of}} NADH and FAD at pH 8. 0 at a specific rate of about 18. 8 ± 1. 85 µmol min- 1 mg protein- 1. Its gene was identified by searching the N-terminal amino acid residues of the purified protein against the genome draft of the bacterium. It encodes a protein composed of 391 amino acids with 62 % identity to HSP hydroxylase (HspB) from Pseudomonas putida S 16, which degrades nicotine via the pyrrolidine pathway. Considering the application potential of 2, 5 -DHP in agriculture and medicine, we developed a route to transform HSP into 2, 5 -DHP with recombinant HSP hydroxylase and an NADH-regenerating system (formate, NAD+ and formate dehydrogenase), via which around 0. 53 ± 0. 03 mM 2, 5 -DHP was produced from 0. 76 ± 0. 01 mM HSP with a molar conversion as 69. 7 %.

Toxicity studies suggest that compounds leached from cigarette butts in salt and fresh water are toxic to aquatic micro-organisms and test fish. Toxic chemicals have also been identified in roadside TPW. With as much as two-thirds of all smoked cigarettes (numbering in the trillions globally) being discarded into the environment each year, it is critical to consider the potential toxicity and remediation of these waste products. This article reviews reports on the toxicity of TPW and recommends several policy approaches to mitigation of this ubiquitous environmental blight...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of agro-industrial waste is growing worldwide and these wastes cannot be disposed {{on the ground}} without treatment. The objective of this work was to conduct composting process and anaerobic digestion of a mixture of agro-industrial waste (W), grape (GW), olive (OW) and <b>tobacco</b> (TW) <b>waste.</b> The composting process and anaerobic digestion {{of the mixture of}} GW, OW and TW in the ratio GW:OW:TW = 1 : 1 : 1. 98 (dry matter) were carried out in column reactors with effective volume of 10 dm 3 and 124 cm 3, respectively, during 21 days. The composting experiment was carried out under forced aeration, while anaerobic digestion was conducted without aeration at temperature of 37 °C in anaerobic digester. Three different anaerobic experiments were conducted, without inoculum (E 1) and with different ratio of inoculum and waste (E 2, E 3). During 21 days of composting of agro-industrial waste, the obtained conversion was 50...|$|R
40|$|Cigarette butts (<b>tobacco</b> product <b>waste</b> (TPW)) are {{the single}} most {{collected}} item in environmental trash cleanups worldwide. This brief descriptive study used an online survey tool (Survey Monkey) to assess knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs among individuals representing the Framework Convention Alliance (FCA) about this issue. The FCA has about 350 members, including mainly non-governmental tobacco control advocacy groups that support implementation of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). Although the response rate (28 %) was low, respondents represented countries from all six WHO regions. The majority (62 %) have heard the term TPW, and nearly all (99 %) considered TPW as an environmental harm. Most (77 %) indicated that the tobacco industry should be responsible for TPW mitigation, and 72 % felt that smokers should also be held responsible. This baseline information may inform future international discussions by the FCTC Conference of the Parties (COP) regarding environmental policies that may be addressed within FCTC obligations. Additional research is planned regarding the entire lifecycle of tobacco’s impact on the environment...|$|R
