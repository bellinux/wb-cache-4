5|$|At {{least in}} some species, {{juvenile}} ctenophores appear capable of producing small quantities of eggs and sperm while <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>well</b> below adult size, and adults produce eggs and sperm {{for as long as}} they have sufficient food. If they run short of food, they first stop producing eggs and sperm, and then shrink in size. When the food supply improves, they grow back to normal size and then resume reproduction. These features make ctenophores capable of increasing their populations very quickly.|$|E
5|$|The Broadmead {{shopping}} centre was redeveloped {{in the early}} years of the century, involving the demolition of one the city's tallest mid-century towers, Tollgate House, in the construction of Cabot Circus. The former Bristol and West Tower was reworked into a glass skyscraper with glass panels in place of its concrete outer cladding. In 2005, the city council undertook extensive consultations about the future of tall buildings in Bristol, and identified support for new tall buildings so long as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>well</b> designed, sustainable, distinctive and 'fit' into the existing urban landscape.|$|E

5|$|Yusuf {{has built}} a largely subservient and loyal {{apparatus}} by putting his fellow Majerteen clansmen in strategic positions. The National Security Agency (NSA) under General Mohamed Warsame (“Darwish”) and the so-called “Majerteen militia” units in the TFG army operate in parallel and often above other security agencies. Their exact number is hard to ascertain, but estimates suggest about 2,000. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>well</b> catered for, well armed and often carry out counter-insurgency operations {{with little or no}} coordination with other security agencies. In the short term, this strategy may appear effective for the president, who can unilaterally employ the force essentially as he pleases. However, it undermines morale in the security services and is a cause of their high desertion rates.|$|E
5|$|In Nebraska, a {{small number}} of pallid {{sturgeon}} have been captured along the lower reaches of the Platte River. Unlike most rivers in the Mississippi-Missouri River System, the Platte River has only a few dams and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>well</b> upstream from its confluence with the Missouri River. The lower Platte River is shallow with numerous sand bars and small islands. Though pallid sturgeon prefer more turbulent and deeper rivers than the Platte, between 1979 and 2003, over a dozen pallid sturgeon, including some from hatcheries, have been captured from the Platte River. A number of these pallid sturgeon have been fitted with radio transmitters which track their return to the Platte River when water levels and turbidity conditions are favorable. Coinciding with the majority of the pallid sturgeon that have been captured, the period that is generally most favorable is during the spring and early summer. By midsummer, a reduction in water levels and turbidity on the Platte River encourages pallid sturgeon to return to the Missouri River.|$|E

25|$|In mathematics, a Cohen–Macaulay ring is a {{commutative}} {{ring with}} some of the algebro-geometric properties of a smooth variety, such as local equidimensionality.

Cohen–Macaulay rings {{play a central role in}} commutative algebra: they form a very broad class, and yet <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>well</b> understood in many ways.|$|E

25|$|The Vandals are a {{punk rock}} band from the United States {{established}} in 1980 in Huntington Beach, California.

They also have their own official record label called Evilegend 13 Records on which they have released EPs, singles and videos. Balzac is also well known for its toy releases, some created by the companies T.W.I.M. and Secret Base, and its extensive discography and side-projects.|$|E
25|$|Bileaflet {{heart valves}} consist of two semicircular {{leaflets}} that rotate about struts {{attached to the}} valve housing. This design was introduced in 1979 and while {{they take care of}} {{some of the issues that}} were seen in the other models, bileaflets are vulnerable to backflow and so they cannot be considered as ideal. Bileaflet valves do, however, provide much more natural blood flow than caged-ball or tilting-disc implants. One of the main advantages of these valves is that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>well</b> tolerated by the body. Only a small amount of blood thinner is needed to be taken by the patient each day in order to prevent clotting of the blood when flowing through the valve.|$|E
25|$|South Georgia pintails {{breed in}} solitary pairs {{during a long}} {{breeding}} season from late October to early March. Their nests are frequently sited some distance away from water; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>well</b> concealed in tussock grass, often on a shallow platform of grass stems and down feathers above the ground and shielded from above by overhanging vegetation. When returning from feeding, they usually land some distance away from the nest before creeping to it through the undergrowth, {{so as not to}} lead predatory birds to the vulnerable eggs and chicks. They lay small clutches of three to five pale cinnamon-pink eggs, and their chicks' down is dark. They mate for life, with males assisting in raising the young.|$|E
