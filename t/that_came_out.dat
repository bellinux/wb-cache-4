5|$|At {{about this}} time, civil strife {{broke out in}} Corinth between the {{democratic}} party and the oligarchic party. The democrats, supported by the Argives, launched an attack on their opponents, and the oligarchs were driven from the city. These exiles went to the Spartans, based at this time at Sicyon, for support, while the Athenians and Boeotians came up to support the democrats. In a night attack, the Spartans and exiles succeeded in seizing Lechaeum, Corinth's port on the Gulf of Corinth, and defeated the army <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> to challenge them the next day. The anti-Spartan allies then attempted to invest Lechaeum, but the Spartans launched an attack and drove them off.|$|E

5|$|Columbia Pictures {{executive}} Amy Pascal suggested Angelina Jolie to Noyce, who {{had often}} spoken to Jolie {{in the past}} about a desire to create a female spy franchise. Pascal even invited Jolie for a Bond girl role, but the actress playfully replied that she {{was more interested in}} playing James Bond himself instead. Jolie was sent Salts script in September 2008 and liked it. Wimmer, Noyce, and producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura went to visit Jolie at her home in France to discuss a possible script and character change. Writer Brian Helgeland helped with the character development and dialogue of the script based on the notes <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of those discussions with Jolie and to accompany the gender change, the title character's name was changed to Evelyn Salt.|$|E
5|$|MDSHA has {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} east–west corridor between the MD 28–MD 97 intersection at Norbeck and the I-95–MD 198 interchange, a corridor that forms the most direct route from Laurel to Rockville. Plans for the MD 198 portion of the corridor call for expanding the route to a four-lane divided highway from MD 650 to US 29 and widening the highway to six lanes from the Montgomery–Prince George's County line to west of I-95. The proposals also include adding a center turn lane to MD 198 between Old Columbia Pike and the Columbia Pike intersection and constructing roundabouts at Good Hope Road, Thompson Road, and Peach Orchard Road in Spencerville. MDSHA has also {{conducted a study}} concerning MD 198 between the Baltimore–Washington Parkway and Fort Meade. Proposed improvements are associated with the Base Realignment and Closure process that has greatly increased activity at Fort Meade. The preferred alternative <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> {{of the study was to}} expand MD 198 from the Baltimore–Washington Parkway to MD 32 to a four-lane divided highway and to construct a flyover ramp from westbound MD 32 to westbound MD 198 to supplement the existing dumbbell interchange.|$|E

25|$|The CMP {{utilizes}} {{several different}} methods to reduce traffic congestion. One innovative design <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> {{of one of}} the MPO's Congestion Management Studies is the Diverging diamond interchange (DDI). Because of the CMP suggesting that this type of interchange should be used to alleviate bottlenecks in the MPO area, KYTC chose to use a DDI design for the Harrodsburg Road and New Circle interchange. A public meeting was held on March 29, 2011 at Southern Hills United Methodist Church. This is the first Diverging Diamond Interchange (now called Double Crossover Diamond or DCD) in the state of Kentucky.|$|E
25|$|His {{collaboration}} {{was important}} {{because he was}} the first pentito <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of the winning faction of the Second Mafia War. He was able to update the authorities on the activities within Cosa Nostra throughout the 1980s, including the fates of Filippo Marchese and Giuseppe Greco. Not long after he began to talk to the authorities Mannoia's mother, aunt and one of his sisters were murdered in their Bagheria home as revenge, it being a common tactic by the Mafia to kill the relatives of the pentiti to discourage others from similar cooperation with authorities.|$|E

25|$|Riot grrrl is an {{underground}} feminist punk movement that {{originated in the}} early 1990s in Washington state (particularly Olympia) and the greater Pacific Northwest. It also had origins in Washington, D.C. It is a subcultural movement that combines feminist consciousness and punk style and politics. It {{is often associated with}} third-wave feminism, which is sometimes seen as its starting point. It has also been described as a musical genre <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of indie rock, with the punk scene serving as an inspiration for a musical movement in which women could express themselves in the same way men had been doing for the past several years.|$|E
25|$|Whatever is good, bad or {{indifferent}} about Streets of Fire, {{it had a}} {{huge impact}} on other filmmakers. The two movies <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> in the years after that are completely saturated in the iconography of Streets of Fire are RoboCop and Se7en. Se7en’s taking place in another world. It’s not New York. It’s not Chicago. A world where it’s raining all the time. Always dark. Always night, just about. Those are two very successful movies that figured out how to do the stylization with the appropriate amount of gore that they hooked the audience. And I think that if we’d done more gore, our chances of hooking the audience would be greater.|$|E
25|$|In 1924, Miró {{joined the}} Surrealist group. The already {{symbolic}} and poetic nature of Miró’s work, {{as well as}} the dualities and contradictions inherent to it, fit well within the context of dream-like automatism espoused by the group. Much of Miró’s work lost the cluttered chaotic lack of focus that had defined his work thus far, and he experimented with collage and the process of painting within his work so as to reject the framing that traditional painting provided. This antagonistic attitude towards painting manifested itself when Miró referred to his work in 1924 ambiguously as “x” in a letter to poet friend Michel Leiris. The paintings <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of this period were eventually dubbed Miró’s dream paintings.|$|E
