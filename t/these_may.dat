5|$|In 2009, it {{was also}} {{recorded}} from the cave of Ankilitelo in southwestern Madagascar. Remains of a large Macrotarsomys had previously been reported from other southern Madagascar sites, and {{at least some of}} <b>these</b> <b>may</b> be M.petteri. A karstic deposit near Lake Tsimanampetsotsa (dated to the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene on unclear grounds) contained three species of Macrotarsomys, including a very large one that may well be M.petteri. Remains identified as greater big-footed mouse have been reported from a cave at Ankazoabo in southern Madagascar; <b>these</b> <b>may</b> also be Petter's big-footed mouse.|$|E
5|$|Local legends {{associate}} it with Arthurian England and Camelot, though <b>these</b> <b>may</b> be due to {{confusion with}} the better-known Cadbury Castle, near South Cadbury some 50miles to the south.|$|E
5000|$|Trailers {{that do not}} {{adhere to}} <b>these</b> {{guidelines}} <b>may</b> be issued a red band, which indicates approval for only [...] "restricted" [...] or [...] "mature" [...] audiences. <b>These</b> trailers <b>may</b> only be shown theatrically before R-rated, NC-17-rated, unrated movies (only films that are released in theaters rated R and not in theaters rated PG-13). <b>These</b> trailers <b>may</b> include nudity, profanity or other material deemed inappropriate for children.|$|R
50|$|<b>These</b> tests <b>may</b> be {{extended}} to give sub-gram scale products. <b>These</b> products <b>may</b> be purified by recrystallization, and their melting points taken. An example is the formation of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazones from ketones and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine.|$|R
50|$|Because <b>these</b> {{medications}} <b>may</b> cause orthostatic hypotension, {{as well as}} low {{blood pressure}} in general, <b>these</b> agents <b>may</b> interact with other medications that increase risk for low blood pressure, such as other antihypertensives and vasodilators.|$|R
5|$|Play {{behaviour}} {{has been}} observed with birds dropping a leaf {{in the air and}} catching it in mid-air and <b>these</b> <b>may</b> possibly help young birds acquire aerobatic skills.|$|E
5|$|The {{blood of}} {{alligators}} and crocodiles contains peptides with antibiotic properties. <b>These</b> <b>may</b> contribute to future antibacterial drugs.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of steroids}} {{in the attempt}} to reduce the ICP is controversial. <b>These</b> <b>may</b> be used in severe papilledema, but {{otherwise}} their use is discouraged.|$|E
5000|$|Civic {{engagement}} generally {{refer to}} clubs and programming focusing on creating positive societal change. Some of <b>these</b> activities <b>may</b> also {{fall under the}} academic category as <b>these</b> activities <b>may</b> work to educate students about social issues {{and the importance of}} getting involved.|$|R
5000|$|In adults, X-rays {{may reveal}} {{bilateral}} femoral pseudofractures in the lateral [...] diaphysis. <b>These</b> pseudofractures <b>may</b> remain for years, {{but they may}} not heal until they break completely or the patient receives intramedullary fixation. <b>These</b> patients <b>may</b> also experience recurrent metatarsal fractures.|$|R
5000|$|In the CHOICES, it {{was noted}} that {{translating}} the effects of <b>these</b> interventions <b>may</b> in fact differ among communities throughout the nation. In addition it was suggested that limited outcomes are studied and <b>these</b> interventions <b>may</b> have an additional effect that is not fully appreciated.|$|R
5|$|A few sculptures, {{including}} Epimetheus and Pandora, {{have been}} attributed to El Greco. This doubtful attribution is based on the testimony of Pacheco (he saw in El Greco's studio a series of figurines, but <b>these</b> <b>may</b> have been merely models). There are also four drawings among the surviving works of El Greco; three of them are preparatory works for the altarpiece of Santo Domingo el Antiguo and the fourth is a study for one of his paintings, The Crucifixion.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{important}} principles spring from the basic idea {{of the rule of}} law. <b>These</b> <b>may</b> be divided into two groups: principles that ensure the law is capable of guiding its subjects' behaviour, and principles establishing legal machinery to secure compliance with the rule of law.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, onions may be bred {{and grown}} to mature at smaller sizes. Depending on the mature {{size and the}} purpose for which the onion is used, <b>these</b> <b>may</b> be {{referred}} to as pearl, boiler, or pickler onions, but differ from true pearl onions which are a different species. Pearl and boiler onions may be cooked as a vegetable rather than as an ingredient and pickler onions are often preserved in vinegar as a long-lasting relish.|$|E

5|$|Advertising {{coloration}} can {{signal the}} services an animal offers to other animals. <b>These</b> <b>may</b> {{be of the}} same species, as in sexual selection, or of different species, as in cleaning symbiosis. Signals, which often combine colour and movement, may be understood by many different species; for example, the cleaning stations of the banded coral shrimp Stenopus hispidus are visited by different species of fish, and even by reptiles such as hawksbill sea turtles.|$|E
5|$|All that {{is known}} of the {{appearance}} of the castle is from contemporary drawings. Although <b>these</b> <b>may</b> seem fanciful to modern eyes, there are better preserved sites which share some features. Tutbury and Pontefract Castles both have similar gatehouses and chapels, and Tutbury's motte and Pontefract's curtain wall are also close in style to those in the illustrations. Sandal Castle has a multi-angular tower like those depicted, and this feature is confirmed at Melbourne by foundations which still remain.|$|E
5|$|Although in most cacti, {{the stem}} {{acts as the}} main organ for storing water, some cacti have in {{addition}} large taproots. <b>These</b> <b>may</b> be several times {{the length of the}} above-ground body in the case of species such as Copiapoa atacamensis, which grows in one of the driest places in the world, the Atacama Desert in northern Chile.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{scientific}} discipline of astronomy has made tremendous strides {{in understanding the}} nature of the Universe and its contents, there remain some important unanswered questions.

5|$|Another {{model for}} the {{evolution}} of circular permutations is the fission and fusion model. The process starts with two partial proteins. <b>These</b> <b>may</b> represent two independent polypeptides (such as two parts of a heterodimer), or may have originally been halves of a single protein that underwent a fission event to become two polypeptides.|$|E

50|$|Post-transplant {{lymphoproliferative}} disorder (PTLD) {{is the name}} given to a B-cell proliferation due to therapeutic immunosuppression after organ transplantation. <b>These</b> patients <b>may</b> develop infectious mononucleosis-like lesions or polyclonal polymorphic B-cell hyperplasia. Some of <b>these</b> B-cells <b>may</b> undergo mutations which will render them malignant, giving rise to a lymphoma.|$|R
5|$|Coins of Ezana {{without any}} symbol at all {{have also been}} found, along with similar symboless coins of his father, Ousanas. <b>These</b> <b>may</b> reflect a {{transition}} in the religion in Aksum when Frumentius was influencing Ezana's father and gathering Christians in the country, giving weight to the writings of Rufinus. The lack of symbol altogether may reflect an uncertainty as how best to exhibit the change in religion of the Aksumite state.|$|E
5|$|Encephalopathy often occurs {{together}} with other symptoms and signs of liver failure. <b>These</b> <b>may</b> include jaundice (yellow discolouration of the skin and the whites of the eyes), ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity), and peripheral edema (swelling of the legs due to fluid build-up in the skin). The tendon reflexes may be exaggerated, and the plantar reflex may be abnormal, namely extending rather than flexing (Babinski's sign) in severe encephalopathy. A particular smell (foetor hepaticus) may be detected.|$|E
5|$|Formal {{criteria}} {{exist for}} each of the main subtypes of Guillain–Barré syndrome (AIDP and AMAN/AMSAN, see below), but <b>these</b> <b>may</b> misclassify some cases (particularly where there is reversible conduction failure) and therefore changes to these criteria have been proposed. Sometimes, repeated testing may be helpful.|$|E
