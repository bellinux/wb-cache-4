5|$|On 21 January 1968, a B-52G, {{with four}} nuclear bombs aboard {{as part of}} Operation Chrome Dome, crashed on the ice of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Star</b> Bay while {{attempting}} an emergency landing at Thule Air Base, Greenland. The resulting fire caused extensive radioactive contamination, the cleanup (Project Crested Ice) lasting until September of that year. Following closely on the Palomares incident, the cleanup costs and political consequences proved too high to risk again, so SAC ended the airborne alert program the following day.|$|E

5|$|As {{industry}} and railroads left the Mississippi riverfront, people gradually {{became aware that}} the riverfront could be a destination for living, working, and shopping. The Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board acquired land along the river banks, including much of Nicollet Island, all of Boom Island, and the West River Parkway corridor. These properties were developed with trails and parkways, and this spurred the development of private land adjacent to the riverfront, creating the new Mill District neighborhood. The Stone Arch Bridge was opened to pedestrian traffic in 1994, creating a link in the trail system and providing spectacular views of Saint Anthony Falls. Some of the old commercial buildings were adapted to new uses. The Whitney Hotel was built {{in what used to}} be the Standard Mill, while <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Star</b> Lofts was a new use for the former North Star Woolen Mills building. Other projects, such as Saint Anthony Main and a number of condominium and townhouse projects, provide residents with the opportunity to live within view of Saint Anthony Falls.|$|E
5|$|In America, documentaries were {{produced}} in various ways: General Marshall commissioned the Why We Fight propaganda series from Frank Capra; the War Department's Information-Education Division started out making training films for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy; the Army made its own through the U.S. Signal Corps, including John Huston's The Battle of San Pietro. Hollywood made films with propaganda messages about America's allies, such as Mrs. Miniver (1942), which portrayed a British {{family on the}} home front; Edge of Darkness (1943) showed Norwegian resistance fighters, and <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Star</b> (1943) showed the Soviet Union and its Communist Party. Towards {{the end of the}} war popular books provided higher quality and more serious stories for films such as Guadalcanal Diary (film) (1943), Mervyn LeRoy's Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo (1944), and John Ford's They Were Expendable (1945).|$|E
5|$|The Butlers founded Circus Juventas as {{a nonprofit}} {{corporation}} in October 1994, citing {{a desire to}} give back to the community as {{one of the reasons for}} its creation. It was originally known as Circus of the Star, so called for Minnesota's nickname, <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Star</b> State. The newly opened Hillcrest Recreation Center in Saint Paul provided the couple with inspiration for the circus program, and they asked the city if they could hold classes there. The Saint Paul Parks and Recreation Department approved the program, and assumed liability for approximately fifty children who enrolled the first year. About thirty of those students stayed with the program and performed in their first show at the 1995 Highland Fest, an annual family-oriented neighborhood festival. After this performance, interest in the program increased. By 1996, 30 more students were enrolled, and by 1997, an additional 25 had joined the program. The circus was still based out of the Hillcrest Recreation Center's gym, and had to work around the schedule of the other regular activities in the facility. In 1997, the waitlist for the program was around 200 students.|$|E
25|$|From early May, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> {{had a big}} {{turn-around}} in performance. By month's end <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> {{were equal}} 2nd in the AIHL on points.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> 1977-78 Minnesota <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> {{season was}} <b>the</b> 11th season for <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Stars.</b> <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> were in {{financial}} trouble, and at season's end {{had the worst}} record in the league at 18-53-9. In June 1978, with both <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> and <b>the</b> Cleveland Barons {{on the verge of}} folding, the league approved an arrangement in which the two teams were permitted to merge under the ownership of Barons owner George Gund III. The merged franchise continued as <b>the</b> Minnesota <b>North</b> <b>Stars,</b> but assumed <b>the</b> Barons' old place in the Adams Division.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> entered <b>the</b> AIHL in the 2002 expansion, {{when the}} league swelled from three teams to six. 2002 {{was a year}} of harsh lessons for <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> who upset <b>the</b> {{eventual}} champions the Sydney Bears twice, but suffered several harsh defeats. Top scorer for <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> in 2002 was imported Canadian Brett Hillier (Estevan Bruins).|$|R
5|$|One of {{the reasons}} the {{development}} team chose Tokyo as the main setting was that its turbulent history, going through multiple phases of development and often suffering severe damage in wars or due to natural disasters, made it comparable with the fantasy settings of other games at the time. In a later interview, an Atlus staff member stated that this setting and style made it the antithesis of traditional fantasy RPGs, adding that this resulted in the game developing a punk spirit. Because of the post-apocalyptic setting of Megami Tensei II, the development team wanted to depict a time before the apocalypse. The decision to set the game in Tokyo was made by Suzuki and Kaneko, and was influenced by manga such as Violence Jack, Devilman, and Fist of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Star.</b> Kichijōji was decided to be the game's starting point due to Kaneko, Suzuki, and Ito all having lived in or near the area, or having visited it often. The abandoned Terminal Echo building there fascinated them, making them wonder how a building in such a prime location could remain unoccupied; Ito described it as two floors of arcade cabinets, {{with the rest of the}} building feeling like a ghost town. This fascination led to it being included as a dungeon in the game. While designing the maps, Kaneko wanted to use wire-frame models, but the Super Famicom's limited capacities meant this idea was scrapped.|$|E

25|$|In 1847, Frederick Douglass {{founded the}} {{abolitionist}} newspaper <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Star</b> in Rochester. Douglass, a former slave and an antislavery speaker and writer, gained {{a circulation of}} over 4,000 readers in the United States, Europe and the Caribbean. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Star</b> served as a forum for abolitionist views. The Douglass home burnt down in 1872, but a marker for {{it can be found}} in Highland Park off South Avenue.|$|E

5000|$|Nanne {{is arguably}} {{best known for}} his career as a general manager and coach of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> and for <b>the</b> United States Canada Cup entries. With an {{infusion}} of notable players from the merger with the Cleveland Barons and through the draft, Nanne quickly rebuilt <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> into a contender after his playing career ended in 1978. The Stars would reach the Stanley Cup finals in 1981, the semifinals in 1984, and would make it to the playoffs seven consecutive seasons (1979-80 - 1985-86). This winning run would see <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> average over 35 wins per season, and encompass <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> sole 40-win season and six of the organization's ten 35-plus-win seasons. In 1988, following two seasons in which <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> finished well below [...]500 and had consecutive fifth-place finishes in the Norris Division, Nanne resigned from <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> citing health reasons. Nanne also served as general manager of the United States team in the 1981, 1984 and 1987 Canada Cup tournaments.|$|R
50|$|While {{the merger}} allowed <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> ice a {{stronger}} team, it also saw <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> take <b>the</b> Barons' {{place in the}} tough Adams Division. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> finished with 68 points, which was a substantial improvement over either <b>the</b> Barons' or <b>North</b> Stars' performance <b>the</b> previous season. Had <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> still been in the Smythe Division, {{that would have been}} good enough for second place and a playoff berth, but it was not enough to lift the team out of last place in the Adams. Minnesota missed the playoffs for the 5th time in 6 years. One of the highlights was Bobby Smith winning the Calder Trophy.|$|R
25|$|However, {{during that}} year {{his home on}} South Avenue in Rochester, New York, burned down; arson was suspected. A {{complete}} issue of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Star</b> was lost. Douglass then moved to Washington, D.C.|$|E
