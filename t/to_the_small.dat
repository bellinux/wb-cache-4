5|$|After {{affecting}} Puerto Rico, {{the hurricane}} passed {{just north of}} the Dominican Republic, producing very little damage.

5|$|A refined {{estimate}} of $1.1billion ($2.74 billion in 2007 dollars) was determined {{in a study}} by the International Trade Commission {{at the request of the}} United States Congress.

5|$|Across {{the county}} {{line in the}} town of Caton, NY225 {{continues}} west through the gully for another , slowly rising in elevation as it heads past a small number of isolated homes. The creek reaches its source near NY225's junction with the southern terminus of CR34 (Whiskey Creek Road), at which point the route ascends out of the valley and heads southwest across lightly developed, relatively level terrain <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> hamlet of Caton. In the center of the community, NY225 intersects CR32 (Caton–Seeley Creek Road) and CR120 (Tannery Creek Road). NY225 turns northwest at this intersection, becoming Caton Road as it follows Caton Creek out of the hamlet.|$|E
5|$|After Bardanes's retirement, Nikephoros {{formally}} dismissed him and confiscated {{much of his}} property. The other thematic generals {{who took}} part in the revolt were also dismissed from their posts, the metropolitan bishops of Sardis, Amorion and Nicomedia were punished for their support of the uprising by exile <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> island of Pantelleria off Sicily, while the soldiers of the Anatolian armies were left unpaid for a year.|$|E

5|$|After {{aftershocks}} {{from the}} quake had concluded, examination took place, producing a focal solution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> events. Movement of these shocks {{was similar to}} that of previous earthquakes around the Azores. For these earthquakes, scientists had determined that the conjugate nodal plane was responsible, seeing shearing on the right-lateral (dextral) side. All faulting in this area is strike-slip-oriented, and on a rather large scale. Because of this research, information now points towards Azores volcanism being controlled by earthquake movement.|$|E
5|$|After the {{surrender}} of Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, {{the primary reason for}} manned defenses protecting Washington ceased to exist. Initial recommendations by Col. Barton S. Alexander, chief engineer of the , were to divide the defenses into three classes: those that should be kept active (first-class), those that should be mothballed and kept in a reserve state (second-class), and those that should be abandoned entirely (third-class). Owing to its position north of the Potomac River and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> size of the fort, Fort Bayard fell into the third-class category, and was abandoned {{a few months after the}} end of the war.|$|E
5|$|Although Jennings {{dreamed of}} {{following}} in his father's footsteps in broadcasting, {{his first job}} was as a bank teller for the Royal Bank of Canada. He had hoped that the company would assign him to its Havana branch; instead, it located him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> town of Prescott, Ontario, before transferring him to its nearby Brockville branch. During this time, he explored acting by appearing in several amateur musical productions with the Orpheus Musical Theatre Society, including Damn Yankees and South Pacific.|$|E

Thousands of Soviets were deported to Germany to be used as slave labor beginning in 1942.|$|E
5|$|Canoe slalom is {{the only}} Olympic {{discipline}} not on the Pan American Games program. It was, in fact, scheduled {{to be held at}} both the 2007 and 2011 Pan American Games, but due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> number of countries competing in the discipline, the event was dropped. However, the discipline is scheduled to make its debut at the 2015 Pan American Games in Toronto, Canada.|$|E

Arriving back in Australia, Wells was made adjutant and quartermaster of the 4th/3rd Battalion, and later brigade major of the 1st Infantry Brigade. During 1938, he was reposted to Royal Military College, Duntroon as a lecturer on tactics.|$|E

Flying through a nebula involves impaired vision, and occasional disruptions to flight electronics. Nebulae have become known as an eerie and suspenseful arena of play.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 1950s, the radical reform of local {{government}} in Wales was considered more pressing than that in England, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> size {{of many of the}} existing authorities, especially the upper tier county councils. The Local Government Commission for Wales set up in 1958 was the first to recommend wholesale amalgamation of the administrative counties outside Glamorgan and Monmouthshire, with extensive boundary changes; however the then Minister of Housing and Local Government Sir Keith Joseph decided not to accept the report, noting that county amalgamations in England had been highly unpopular when proposed.|$|E
