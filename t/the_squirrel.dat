5|$|Pierre Mein and Léonard Ginsburg {{described}} Lagrivea vireti in 2002 in {{a review}} of the ages and faunas of the Miocene fossil sites of La Grive-Saint-Alban in southeastern France. They suggested that it was probably a tree squirrel and related to the Sciurini. Lagrivea belongs to <b>the</b> <b>squirrel</b> family (Sciuridae), which first appears in the Late Eocene of North America and Early Oligocene of Europe. The specific name, vireti, honors Jean Viret for his work on the mammals of La Grive-Saint-Alban.|$|E

5|$|The idea {{of using}} {{anthropomorphic}} furry animals as protagonists in a story set in the American West pre-dated Popol Out West by several years. In December 1931, Hergé produced Tim-L'Ésureuil, Héros du Far-West ("Tim <b>the</b> <b>Squirrel,</b> Hero of the Far West") for L'Innovation, a large department store in Brussels. Printed in colour, it was serialised in 16 weekly installments, and was aimed to encourage children's interest in the store.|$|E
5|$|The story {{contains}} {{a number of}} elements that Hergé had already utilized in earlier comics The Adventures of Tim <b>the</b> <b>Squirrel</b> out West (1931) and The Adventures of Tom and Millie (1933). He prevented its republication during the German occupation of Belgium, and it was colourised and republished in 1948 in Tintin magazine. Casterman first published it in a collected album in 1952.|$|E
5|$|The unnamed eagle is attested in {{both the}} Poetic Edda, {{compiled}} in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, while Veðrfölnir is solely attested in the Prose Edda.

5|$|Conker <b>the</b> <b>Squirrel</b> {{also had}} its own game. Originally named Conker's Quest, the title was renamed to Twelve Tales: Conker 64. However, the new title was criticised for being too family-friendly and too similar to Banjo-Kazooie. As a result, the team renamed the game to Conker's Bad Fur Day and was re-revealed again in 2000. Conker's Bad Fur Day, unlike Banjo-Kazooie, was {{intended}} for a mature audience, and features violence, profanity and scatological humour. The game received positive reviews from critics, but was a commercial failure as the game was released {{at the end of}} the Nintendo 64's life cycle and the game was not actively promoted by Nintendo.|$|E
5|$|Conker's Bad Fur Day is an action-platform {{game where}} the player {{controls}} Conker <b>the</b> <b>Squirrel</b> {{through a series}} of three-dimensional levels. The game features an overworld where players can transition from one level to another, although many are initially blocked off until Conker earns a certain amount of cash. Each level is an enclosed area in which the player can freely explore to find tasks to do. The gameplay mostly relies on figuring out a way to help other characters by completing a linear sequence of challenges. These challenges may include defeating a boss, solving puzzles, gathering objects, and racing opponents, among others. The result is always a cash reward, which aids access to other areas in the overworld.|$|E
5|$|Conker's Bad Fur Day is an action-platform {{video game}} {{developed}} by Rare and released for the Nintendo 64 video game console in 2001.

The gameplay is composed of various challenges that involve platforming, solving puzzles, fighting enemies, and gathering objects. The game also features a multiplayer mode where a maximum of four players can compete in seven different game types.|$|E
2500|$|Nelson's {{antelope}} squirrels {{are social}} animals. [...] When individually {{taken out of}} their home range and released in an unknown area, they seem helpless and confused. They do not expend much energy throughout the day because of the extreme temperatures in their environment. In fact, when in the direct sunlight, a temperature of 31-32°C can kill them. Therefore, there is little activity from <b>the</b> <b>squirrels</b> during <b>the</b> heat of the day. [...] Although {{there is no evidence}} of hibernation, <b>the</b> <b>squirrels</b> are not bothered by the cold and can survive temperatures below freezing, in their burrows. They are not early risers and are usually not seen until after sunrise, however it does forage in the morning and evening, avoiding the midday heat. Around noon <b>the</b> <b>squirrels</b> disappear into their burrows and are not seen again until about 2 pm at the earliest. On moderate days, <b>the</b> <b>squirrels</b> will take their time foraging, in contrast to bringing as much food back to their burrows as quickly as possible on hot or cold days. <b>The</b> <b>squirrels</b> are also known to fully stretch out and roll over in the dust on the ground. [...] These dust baths appear to be very enjoyable activities for <b>the</b> <b>squirrels</b> and may also be used to prevent infestation of parasites.|$|R

5|$|The rostral migratory stream (RMS) is a {{specialized}} migratory route {{found in the}} brain of some animals along which neuronal precursors that originated in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the brain migrate to reach the main olfactory bulb (OB). The importance of the RMS lies {{in its ability to}} refine and even change an animal's sensitivity to smells, which explains its importance and larger size in the rodent brain as compared to the human brain, as our olfactory sense is not as developed. This pathway has been studied in the rodent, rabbit, and both <b>the</b> <b>squirrel</b> monkey and rhesus monkey. When the neurons reach the OB they differentiate into GABAergic interneurons as they are integrated into either the granule cell layer or periglomerular layer.|$|E
5|$|Hergé sought work {{elsewhere}} too, creating The Lovable Mr. Mops cartoon for the Bon Marché department store, and The Adventures of Tim <b>the</b> <b>Squirrel</b> Out West for {{the rival}} L'Innovation department store. On 20 July 1932 he married Germaine Kieckens, who was Wallez's secretary; although {{neither of them}} were entirely happy with the union, they had been encouraged {{to do so by}} Wallez, who demanded that all his staff married and who personally carried out the wedding ceremony at the Saint-Roch Church in Laeken. Spending their honeymoon in Vianden, Luxembourg, the couple moved into an apartment in the rue Knapen, Schaerbeek. After Wallez was removed from the paper's editorship in August 1933 following a scandal, Hergé became despondent; in March 1934 he tried to resign, but was encouraged to stay after his monthly salary was increased from 2000 to 3000 francs and his workload was reduced, with Jamin taking responsibility for the day-to-day running of Le Petit Vingtième.|$|E
5|$|Indigenous peoples {{living in}} northeastern North America {{were the first}} groups known to have {{produced}} maple syrup and maple sugar. According to aboriginal oral traditions, as well as archaeological evidence, maple tree sap was being processed into syrup long before Europeans arrived in the region. There are no authenticated accounts of how maple syrup production and consumption began, but various legends exist; {{one of the most}} popular involves maple sap being used in place of water to cook venison served to a chief. Other stories credit the development of maple syrup production to Nanabozho, Glooskap, or <b>the</b> <b>squirrel.</b> Aboriginal tribes developed rituals around sugar-making, celebrating the Sugar Moon (the first full moon of spring) with a Maple Dance. Many aboriginal dishes replaced the salt traditional in European cuisine with maple sugar or syrup.|$|E

There was the law, he said. Nature had given him a sign. <b>The</b> <b>squirrel,</b> immediately upon recognizing danger, had taken to his legs without ado.

5|$|Timber {{recruits}} a team {{of eight}} racers: Diddy Kong, the first recruit; Conker <b>the</b> <b>Squirrel</b> and Banjo the Bear, recruited by Diddy; Krunch the Kremling, Diddy's enemy who follows after him; and Tiptup the Turtle, T.T. the Stopwatch, Pipsy the Mouse, and Bumper the Badger, inhabitants of Timber's island. Aided by Taj, an Indian elephant-like genie residing on the island, they eventually complete all of Wizpig's challenges and confront Wizpig himself to a race and defeat him. Shortly afterwards, Drumstick is turned back into a rooster, and Wizpig leaves for his home planet, Future Fun Land. Fearing that Wizpig would again attempt to invade Timber's Island, the islanders travel to Future Fun Land for a second challenge. When Wizpig loses the second race, the rocket he rides on malfunctions and launches him to the moon. However, an additional cutscene reveals Wizpig's spaceship flying through the sky, unscathed.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} mascot of the 2001 Southeast Asian Games is {{a squirrel}} named Si Tumas, short form for Tupai Emas (Golden squirrel). It is said <b>the</b> <b>Squirrel</b> is a lovable creature found almost {{everywhere in the}} world. In folk tales of many countries, <b>the</b> <b>squirrel</b> is depicted as a friendly and fun animal known for its high energy and speed of motion. The adoption of <b>the</b> <b>squirrel</b> as the games mascot is to borrow its pleasant, friendly fun characteristics to add life to the event. The gold colouring on <b>the</b> <b>squirrel</b> enhances the winning aspect. The word SI is phonetically similar to Sea as in SEA GAMES and also a friendly form of address in Malay. TU is {{the first part of}} Tupai which means squirrel in Malay and MAS comes from the word EMAS which is Malay for gold.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In Italy {{there are}} four species of squirrels: <b>the</b> native red <b>squirrel</b> and other three species {{recently}} introduced. <b>The</b> red <b>squirrel</b> {{is present in the}} Italian peninsula with three subspecies, and is missing only in Salento, and Italian islands. This species is common on Alps and Apennines, while in the plains it is declining because of the habitat loss. Competition with <b>the</b> grey <b>squirrel</b> and habitat fragmentation are considered the major threats to the survival of <b>the</b> red <b>squirrel.</b> <b>The</b> grey <b>squirrel</b> is present in Piedmont and Liguria. A study on the Piedmontese colony showed that <b>the</b> red <b>squirrel</b> is disappearing from the area colonised by <b>the</b> grey <b>squirrel</b> and <b>the</b> damage due to bark-stripping and feeding is considerable. Free-ranging populations of the Siberian chipmunk live in Belluno, Verona, and Rome, but records of single animals were reported for other areas. <b>The</b> Finlayson's <b>squirrel</b> is present with a small nucleus in an urban area of Piedmont. Here, the impact of this species on the vegetation appears dramatic. The eradication of <b>the</b> grey <b>squirrel</b> is a priority for the conservation of <b>the</b> red <b>squirrel,</b> but control plans for the other introduced species are also needed...|$|R
