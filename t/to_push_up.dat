5|$|The {{screenplay}} by Hampton Fancher was optioned in 1977. Producer Michael Deeley {{became interested in}} Fancher's draft and convinced director Ridley Scott to film it. Scott had previously declined the project, but after leaving the slow production of Dune, wanted a faster-paced project to take his mind off his older brother's recent death. He joined the project on February 21, 1980, and managed <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>up</b> the promised Filmways financing from US$13million to $15million. Fancher's script focused more on environmental issues and less on issues of humanity and religion, which are prominent in the novel and Scott wanted changes. Fancher found a cinema treatment by William S. Burroughs for Alan E. Nourse's novel The Bladerunner (1974), titled Blade Runner (a movie). Scott liked the name, so Deeley obtained {{the rights to the}} titles. Eventually he hired David Peoples to rewrite the script and Fancher left the job over the issue on December 21, 1980, although he later returned to contribute additional rewrites.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, Bedford School was one {{of fifty}} of the country's leading private schools which were accused of running a price-fixing cartel which had allowed them <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>up</b> school fees.

25|$|The major {{benefits}} of this tactic is that the team is in complete control over its opponents. Meanwhile, by knocking the ball around, opponents playing the pressing game can easily tire. And should an opportunity suddenly arise, defence may be quickly switched to attack. A major downfall is that because the accuracy of passes needs to be high, short passes between the players are required. This significantly narrows {{the gap between the}} attack, midfield and defence (usually, the latter is forced <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>up).</b> So if the opponent gains possession, a long ball could effectively open up the defence. Similarly, if it is the attack and midfield that need to drop back, the team will have little chances of counter-attacking even if possession is won back.|$|E

25|$|Banks {{can create}} new money {{when they make}} a loan. New loans {{throughout}} the banking system generate new deposits elsewhere in the system. The money supply is usually increased by the act of lending, and reduced when loans are repaid faster than new ones are generated. In the United Kingdom between 1997 and 2007, {{there was an increase}} in the money supply, largely caused by much more bank lending, which served <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>up</b> property prices and increase private debt. The amount of money in the economy as measured by M4 in the UK went from £750 billion to £1700 billion between 1997 and 2007, much of the increase caused by bank lending. If all the banks increase their lending together, then they can expect new deposits to return to them and the amount of money in the economy will increase. Excessive or risky lending can cause borrowers to default, the banks then become more cautious, so there is less lending and therefore less money so that the economy can go from boom to bust as happened in the UK and many other Western economies after 2007.|$|E

It is the latter that contains the spores and later stinks and attracts the flies; within this layer is a green layer which will become the 'head' of the expanded fruit body; and inside this is a white structure called the receptaculum (the stalk when expanded), that is hard, but has an airy structure like a sponge. The eggs become fully grown stinkhorns very rapidly, over a day or two. The mature stinkhorn is [...] tall and [...] in diameter, topped with a conical cap [...] high that is covered with the greenish-brown slimy gleba. In older fungi the slime is eventually removed, exposing a bare yellowish pitted and ridged (reticulate) surface.

40|$|Abstract 1. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects whole body vibrations on maximal strength, power output and neuromuscular activity in m. pectoralis major during bench press. Participants consisted of 35 male and 9 female military high school students (m= 23, 1 years). On the basis of initial maximal performances in bench press the participants was divided into two experiments groups and one control group. Intervention groups performed a specifically designed <b>push</b> <b>up</b> program on a vibrating plate respectively a step board during 12 weeks Initial load at 60 % of 1 RM showed an average of 46, 5 kg. All groups showed an average increase of 13 kg for each person after 12 weeks. Initial value for power output showed a mean of 265 watt, which also showed an increase with an average of 7 watt (with a load equivalent of 60 % of 1 RM at the current test occasion), respectively an increase of 41 watt (with the load performed during the first test occasion). A positive correlation existed between the load at 60 % of 1 RM and achieved power output. No significant differences between groups were exposed concerning estimated maximum strength or power output in bench press. All participants showed an increase in strength development, indicating that vibration stimuli could be compared <b>to</b> traditional <b>push</b> <b>ups</b> training without vibrations. Vibrations seem to have more effects on the magnitude of recruited motor units, why vibrations training could be a good complement to established strength training. Abstract 2. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the effects whole body vibrations on strength development, power output and neuromuscular activity in m. pectoralis major during bench press. The purpose was also to examine what roll self-efficacy plays in strength tasks. Participants consisted of 35 male and 9 female military high school students (m= 23, 1 years). On the basis of initial maximal performances in bench press the participants was divided into two experiments groups and one control group. Intervention groups performed a specifically designed <b>push</b> <b>up</b> program on a vibrating plate respectively a step board during 12 weeks. All participants answered a battery of questionnaires concerning backgrounds, motives for sport participation, self-efficacy and efficacy sources. Initial load at 60 % of 1 RM showed an average of 46, 5 kg (sd = 13, 8). All groups showed an average increase of 13 kg for each person after 12 weeks. Initial value for power output showed a mean of 265 watt, which also showed an increase with an average of 7 watt (with a load equivalent of 60 % of 1 RM at the current test occasion), respectively an increase of 41 watt (with the load performed during the first test occasion). A positive correlation existed between the load at 60 % of 1 RM and achieved power output. No significant differences between groups were exposed concerning estimated maximum strength or power output in bench press. Gender differences showed that men lifted significantly heavier loads at 60 % of 1 RM compared to women. No significant differences could be seen between the groups concerning self efficacy. Gender differences were exposed concerning self-efficacy <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>ups</b> with a pat. The efficacy sources “performance accomplishments” was valuated to be the most influential to form self-efficacy expectations. A strong positive relationship between “performance accomplishments” and achieved self-efficacy <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>ups</b> with pats were shown. Self-efficacy <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>ups</b> with a pat also correlated positively with power output and performed 60 % of 1 RM in bench press. All participants showed an increase in strength development, indicating that vibration stimuli could be compared <b>to</b> traditional <b>push</b> <b>ups</b> training without vibrations. Vibrations seem to have more effects on the magnitude of recruited motor units, why vibrations training could be a good complement to established strength training. Participants relatively high self-efficacy to strength tasks is probably a result of performance accomplishments in there own strength straining rather than the intervention training. Positive relationships between self-efficacy and power output as well as performed 60 % of 1 RM in bench press, indicating that high self-efficacy have a positive influence on strength performance.

2500|$|D Company {{took over}} the pursuit around midday on 18 August. At 15:40 the lead element, 11 Platoon, clashed with a Viet Cong squad and forced them to withdraw. Shortly after {{resuming}} the advance, at 16:08 the platoon came under small-arms and rocket-propelled grenade fire from a flank after drawing ahead of the other platoons and was isolated. Pinned down, they called for artillery support as a monsoon rain began, reducing visibility. Beginning as an encounter battle, heavy fighting ensued as the advancing battalions of the Viet Cong 275th Regiment attempted to encircle and destroy the Australians. After less than 20 minutes {{more than a third}} of 11 Platoon had become casualties, while the platoon commander was killed soon after. 10 Platoon moved up on the left in support but was repulsed. With D Company facing a much larger force, 12 Platoon tried <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>up</b> on the right at 17:15. Fighting off an attack on their right before pushing forward another [...] they sustained increasing casualties after clashing with several groups moving around their western flank to form a cut-off prior to a frontal assault. Opening a path to 11 Platoon yet unable to advance further, they threw smoke to mark their location. Nearly out of ammunition, at 18:00 two UH-1B Iroquois from No. 9 Squadron RAAF arrived overhead to resupply D Company. Meanwhile, the survivors from 11 Platoon withdrew to 12 Platoon during a lull, suffering further losses. Still heavily engaged, both platoons then moved back to the company position covered by artillery.|$|E
