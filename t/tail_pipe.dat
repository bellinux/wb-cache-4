5|$|The {{advanced}} {{clean car}} rules program {{was made to}} reduce <b>tail</b> <b>pipe</b> emissions. The Air Resources Board approved the program to control emissions for newer models from the year 2017 to 2025. Some of their goals by 2025 are to have more environmentally superior cars to be available in different models and different types of cars. New automobiles will emit 34 percent fewer global warming gases and 75 percent fewer smog-forming emissions. And if fully implemented consumers can save an average of $6,000 {{over the life of}} the car.|$|E

500|$|The Camry in the Philippines offers three grades: {{the base}} G, {{offering}} a 2.4-litre engine mated to a five-speed automatic transmission, has 2 SRS airbags, has fabric seats {{and has a}} foot-type parking brake. The 2.4 V is almost {{the same as the}} G variant, however, it has a 4-spoke steering wheel with wood grain, 2 SRS airbags, and has a leather-wrapped wood grain with chrome shift lever and knob. The 3.5 Q is the top-of-the-line segment, offering a 3.5 2GR-FE V6, 24V, DOHC and dual VVT-i. It is mated to a six-speed gate-type automatic transmission, adaptive front lighting system, automatic rain sensor, dual exhaust <b>tail</b> <b>pipe,</b> tri-color/Optitron with multi-information display, 2 SRS front airbags, side SRS airbags, and a push start system. All of the variants has an integrated type / tuner/ in-dash 6 CD changer / MP3 / WMA.

2500|$|The {{operators}} had {{not been}} trained to understand the ambiguous nature of the pilot-operated relief valve indicator and to look for alternative confirmation that the main relief valve was closed.

2500|$|Engine {{failures}} may {{be described}} as [...] "contained" [...] or [...] "uncontained". A contained engine failure {{is one in which}} components might separate inside the engine but either remain within the engine’s cases or exit the engine through the <b>tail</b> <b>pipe.</b> Engine enclosures are not designed to contain broken turbines, rather the turbines are designed not to break. An uncontained engine failure is more serious because pieces often exit the sides of the engine, posing potential danger to the aircraft structure and those within the plane.|$|E
2500|$|A {{counter-example}} is {{the common}} technique for recording an automobile. [...] For recording [...] "Onboard" [...] car sounds (which include the car interiors), a three-microphone technique is common.

2500|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Deltaviex {{was more}} conventional. It was round in cross section, with a pointed nose and air intakes on is upper flanks over the wings {{for the low}} power (...) Maboré engine which exhausted through a <b>tail</b> <b>pipe.</b> The original canopy over its single seat cockpit was raised above the rear fuselage line and had single oval windows both on the sides and as a windscreen. The oval shape made the lower forward window frames broad close to the fuselage, limiting the pilot's view and the cockpit was modified {{at least once in}} the period 1954-6, leading to more conventional glazing with straight lower edges and thin windscreen frames. [...] The Deltaviex had conventional tricycle landing gear, with the narrow track mainwheels retracting into the fuselage.|$|E

50|$|Each engine {{contained}} a diverter valve. These valves either ducted longitudinally into the horizontal thrust nozzles of the aircraft, or inward to the lift nozzles {{located in the}} fuselage. The lift/cruise engines provided forward thrust when faced horizontally and lift when faced vertically. This was {{through the use of}} the diverter valves. All 6 <b>tail</b> <b>pipes</b> had 10° of freedom in order to direct thrust. The fuselage engines were used when initiating VTOL flight but were turned off when the aircraft was sufficiently in flight.|$|R

Equations and methods presented {{are believed to be}} applicable under certain conditions to the design of shrouds for <b>tail</b> <b>pipes</b> of jet engines...|$|R
50|$|Valveless pulsejet engines have no {{moving parts}} and use only their {{geometry}} {{to control the}} flow of exhaust out of the engine.

50|$|The Orochi Kabuto {{was later}} {{released}} as a production car in 2009, and {{was limited to}} five cars.

The interior saw updates as well; several interior parts were replaced with aluminium counterparts. The seats in the Orochi Kabuto were leather with diamond stitching.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} informal procurement within Japanese keiretsu so as to consider effects on intermediate-good imports, such as auto parts. Parts-suppliers make relationship-specific investments that benefit the auto-maker and prices are determined by bargaining after investment has been sunk. Although this investment raises efficiency, it limits the range of imports to less important parts such as <b>tail</b> <b>pipes</b> {{and it is possible}} that no parts are imported, despite lower foreign production costs. Lack of information concerning investment rents combined with counterintuitive effects on imports and Japanese production costs could create unwarranted perceptions of a trade barrier. ...|$|R
