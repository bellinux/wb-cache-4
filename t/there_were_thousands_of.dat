5|$|By September 1, the facility, {{like the}} Superdome, was {{completely}} overwhelmed and declared unsafe and unsanitary. However, even though <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> {{people who were}} evacuating at the center, along with network newscasters, pleading desperately for help on CNN, FOX, and other broadcast outlets, FEMA head Michael Brown and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff both claimed to {{have no knowledge of}} the use of the Convention Center as a shelter until the afternoon of September 1.|$|E
5|$|Across eastern Mexico, {{the heavy}} {{rainfall}} caused mudslides and floods, which {{damaged or destroyed}} 90,000houses, and damaged or destroyed about 3,088,000acres (1,250,000hectares) of crop fields; thousands of livestock were also killed. The floods affected 819 Municipalities of Mexico in 17states and the federal district, leaving about 500,000people homeless, of whom half were in Tabasco and Veracruz states. Several ports were closed due to the floods. Although power lines were downed, most electrical systems were not damaged, and power was quickly restored within a week in most areas. A total of 39rivers overflowed, which washed away bridges, roads, dams, and some entire houses, and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> landslides, mostly in unpopulated areas. Collectively, 28federal highways and 300rural roads were closed or damaged. The federal highway network sustained damage in 1,237locations {{as a result of}} 1,164landslides or mudslides and 28damaged bridges. Damage was estimated at $451.3million (4.3billion pesos).|$|E
5|$|The low {{casualties}} the Commonwealth {{air forces}} incurred during the Battle of Normandy {{led to an}} over-supply of trained aircrew. While the number of pilots and other airmen undergoing training through the EATS had begun to be reduced in early 1944, by 30 June <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> qualified airmen—including 3,000 Australians—in the UK waiting for posts in operational units. This number greatly exceeded {{the requirements of the}} Allied air forces. Accordingly, the flow of airmen from EATS training facilities in Canada to the UK was greatly cut back, and Australia ceased sending airmen overseas for training under the scheme in August. While 1,245 Australian airmen arrived in the UK during the last six months of 1944 (a reduction from the 5,181 who had arrived {{in the first six months}} of the year), only those who were qualified as air gunners were typically ever assigned to combat units. It was not possible to find flying positions for most of the remaining unattached airmen who arrived after June 1944, and some were posted back to Australia; the remainder spent the rest of the war in training courses and various non-flying roles.|$|E

25|$|The union {{appealed to}} the Central Labor Union for a general strike and the {{governor}} issued an ultimatum that he would stop all trucks by midnight, August 5, {{if there was no}} settlement.

Although the strike was gravely weakened by martial law and economic pressure, union leaders made it clear that it would continue.|$|E
25|$|In other cases, like in Argentina, a non-salvationist told Booth that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> British {{people there}} who needed salvation. The four {{officers}} sent in 1890 {{found that those}} British were {{scattered all over the}} pampas. But the missionaries started ministry in the Spanish language and the work spread throughout the country – initially following the rail-road development, since the British in charge of building the rail-roads were usually sympathetic to the movement.|$|E
25|$|Chinese sailors {{first came}} to Hawaii in 1789, {{a few years after}} Captain James Cook came upon the island. Many settled and married Hawaiian women. Most Chinese, Korean and Japanese {{immigrants}} in Hawaii arrived in the 19th century as laborers to work on sugar plantations. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> Asians in Hawaii when it was annexed to the United States in 1898.

25|$|In the meantime, the Great Depression made matters worse. The {{economic}} collapse drove {{a number of}} New England and Mid-Atlantic manufacturers into bankruptcy, while those employers who survived laid off workers and increased the amount and pace of work for their employees even further. Textile workers across the region, from worsted workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts and silk weavers in Paterson, New Jersey, to cotton millhands in Greenville, South Carolina, engaged in hundreds of isolated strikes, even though <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> unemployed workers desperate to take their places.|$|E
25|$|After the Klan was suppressed, similar insurgent {{paramilitary}} groups arose that were explicitly directed at suppressing Republican voting and turning Republicans out of office: the White League, {{which started in}} Louisiana in 1874; and the Red Shirts, which started in Mississippi and developed chapters in the Carolinas. For instance, the Red Shirts are credited with helping elect Wade Hampton as governor in South Carolina. They were described as acting as the military arm of the Democratic Party and are attributed with helping white Democrats regain control of state legislatures throughout the South. In addition, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> Confederate veterans in what were called rifle clubs.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> {{people on}} the move, as African Americans tried to reunite {{families}} separated by slaves sales, and sometimes migrated for better opportunities in towns or other states. Other freed people moved from plantation areas to cities or towns {{for a chance to}} get different jobs. At the same time, whites returned from refuges to reclaim plantations or town dwellings. In some areas, many whites returned to the land to farm for a while. Some freedpeople left the South altogether for states such as Ohio and Indiana, and later, Kansas. Thousands of others joined the migration to new opportunities in the Mississippi and Arkansas Delta bottomlands and Texas.|$|E

25|$|The living {{quarters}} of a castle with a bergfried are separate, often in a lower tower or an adjacent building called a palas (an English-style keep combines both functions of habitation and defence.) Consequently, a bergfried could be built as a tall slender tower with little internal room, few vaults and few if any windows. The bergfried served as a watchtower and as a refuge during sieges (at least if the siege was relatively brief). The distinction between a bergfried and a keep is not always clear-cut, as <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> such towers built with many variations. There are some French keeps with only austere {{living quarters}}, while some late bergfrieds in Germany were intended to be habitable (Piper 1900).|$|E
25|$|After two hours, {{the whale}} was slowly and gently lifted onto a barge by a crane near Albert Bridge. By this stage <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> people {{watching}} the situation develop {{from the banks}} of the river, and the images were seen across the world. The excitement of the previous day had disappeared, and there was now serious concern that the whale would be unable to survive for much longer. As the barge rushed along the Thames towards the sea, news channels provided non-stop coverage of the journey. It reached the Thames Barrier at approximately 5:00 pm. Later, despite the darkness, it was reported that crowds were lining the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge {{to catch a glimpse of}} the barge.|$|E
25|$|Four trams and two {{trailers}} {{were ordered}} from Hannoversche Waggonfabrik (HaWa), with motors from Siemens. The GB Class 1 trams cost NOK 360,000, including some work trailers. The chassis were delivered on 20 July 1924, while the motors came on 5 July. They were assembled at the Dalsenget Depot. The first test run was on 5 July, but failed {{due to a}} short circuit. A successful attempt was made on 9 July. The tracks were completed in March, but not until the trams were delivered could service start. The tramway was opened on 18 July 1924 at 18:00. Ordinary service started the next day. The first weekend <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> {{people who wanted to}} see the new trams, and demand exceeded capacity.

25|$|Thames skiffs were {{developed}} in the 19th century primarily for leisure use by private individuals sculling themselves. The design {{was based on the}} Thames wherries and shallops that were operated by watermen as a water taxi service in London. By the late 19th century, when Jerome K. Jerome wrote of his up-river expedition in Three Men in a Boat, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> skiffs at places like Richmond, Kingston and Oxford. However, there are references to skiffs (as a result of accidents) as early as 1812 and 1824 at Oxford. In August 1815, the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley was taken on a skiffing expedition from Old Windsor to Lechlade by Charles Clairmont and Thomas Love Peacock. He subsequently settled at Marlow where he regularly skiffed through the locks.|$|E
25|$|In August 1775, George III {{declared}} Americans in {{arms against}} royal authority to be traitors to the Crown. Following their surrender at the Battles of Saratoga in October 1777, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> British and Hessian soldiers in American hands. Although Lord Germain took a hard line, the British generals {{on the scene}} never held treason trials; they treated captured enemy soldiers as prisoners of war. The dilemma was that {{tens of thousands of}} Loyalists were under American control and American retaliation would have been easy. The British built much of their strategy around using these Loyalists, and therefore, no Americans were put on trial for treason. The British maltreated the prisoners whom they held, resulting in more deaths to American sailors and soldiers than from combat operations. At the end of the war, both sides released their surviving prisoners.|$|E
25|$|Prior to Prohibition, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> breweries in the United States, mostly brewing heavier beers than modern US beer {{drinkers}} {{are used}} to. Beginning in 1920, {{most of these}} breweries went out of business, although some converted to soft drinks and other businesses. Bootlegged beer was often watered down to increase profits, beginning a trend, still on-going today, of the American markets heavily advertising the weaker beers and keeping them popular. Consolidation of breweries {{and the application of}} industrial quality control standards have led to the mass-production and the mass-marketing of huge quantities of light lagers. Advertising became supreme, and bigger companies fared better in that market. The decades after World War II saw a huge consolidation of the American brewing industry: brewing companies would buy their rivals solely for their customers and distribution systems, shutting down their brewing operations.|$|E
