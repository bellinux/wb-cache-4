5|$|In 1979, before {{construction}} {{had even}} begun, there was opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> Trump Tower and other {{buildings in the}} area. The New York Committee for a Balanced Building Boom {{was concerned about the}} planned rezoning of the area that would arise due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> high-rise towers along Fifth Avenue between 40th and 57th Streets.|$|E

50|$|The dam {{is named}} after Nikolaos Plastiras, a Greek General and Politician who was <b>the</b> first <b>to</b> {{visualize}} <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> a reservoir in the Agrafa area as soon as 1925. He later boosted the efforts while serving as a Prime Minister, but did not live <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dam.|$|R
5|$|Bow Street has {{a strong}} {{connection}} with the law; the Bow Street Runners, an early voluntary police force, was established here by Henry Fielding in 1750, and the Metropolitan Police Service operated a station house from 1832, which led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the Bow Street Magistrates' Court.|$|E
5|$|Francis Pettit Smith, one of {{the inventors}} of the screw {{propeller}} and a contributor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the SS Archimedes, lived in the area between 1864 and 1870.|$|E
5|$|In 1910 {{increasing}} {{enrollment and}} overcrowding led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> a second school building at 740 York Ave. The school was renamed John A. Johnson High School {{in honor of}} the recently deceased Minnesota governor John Albert Johnson (18611909). Students attended class at the second location from 1911 to 1963.|$|E

5|$|Increasing {{traffic levels}} across the Firth of Forth had also led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the Clackmannanshire Bridge {{adjacent}} to the existing Kincardine Bridge. This bridge opened in November 2008.|$|E
5|$|Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the Hanlon Expressway, Hanlon Road existed as {{far north}} as College Avenue. Edinburgh Road was the westernmost {{crossing}} of the Speed River. On {{the opposite side of the}} valley, Silvercreek Road continued, as it does today, along the same right-of-way as Hanlon Road.|$|E

5|$|The first {{woolen mill}} in Danville {{was built on}} Mahoning Creek. An {{agricultural}} fair was held on the creek in February 1856. Phillip Maus once built a sawmill on Mahoning Creek. This sawmill contributed significantly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> numerous wooden buildings in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|Under Edward the Confessor, Ruislip {{had been}} valued at £30, though the {{reduction}} to £12 {{by the time}} Ernulf de Hesdin took possession {{is believed to have}} been caused by a passing unit of the Norman Army taking crops. This led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> buildings at Manor Farm to protect produce.|$|E
5|$|A {{fresh look}} at this concept started at ARPA around 1963–64 under the name Hardpoint. This led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the Hardpoint Demonstration Array Radar, and an even faster missile concept known as HIBEX. This proved {{interesting}} enough for the Army and Air Force to collaborate on a follow-up study, Hardsite. The first Hardsite concept, HSD-I, considered defending bases within urban areas that would have Nike-X protection anyway. An example might be a SAC command and control center or an airfield {{on the outskirts of}} a city. The second study, HSD-II, considered the protection of isolated bases like missile fields. Most follow-up work focused on the HSD-II concept.|$|E

5|$|A {{programme}} of work {{is scheduled}} {{to take place in}} 2018 to replace expansion joints in both towers along with replacing the truss end links. Plans to replace these joints were postponed by the bridge management following the Scottish Government's commitment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the Queensferry Crossing; the original work proposals would have involved round-the-clock contraflows during the installation of ramps and mini-bridges to carry traffic over the work area, and heavy lorries being diverted.|$|E
5|$|After quickly {{growing into}} a city, Omaha failed to pave its streets accordingly. A chaotic {{transportation}} system was highlighted by several miles of successful horsecar tracks; however, the city only ever had four miles (6km) of cable car service. Several early suburbs were built on reliance of service from these lines, including Dundee, Benson and Kountze Place. In the early 1880s an extensive boulevard system {{was built to}} create a park-like atmosphere for drivers throughout the city. The Trans-Mississippi Exposition in 1889 led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> many new transportation features, particularly the magnificent Burlington Station.|$|E
5|$|After {{the war he}} {{returned}} to the Bureau of Ships, where he was involved with the development of nuclear propulsion. Mumma was promoted to rear admiral in 1954, and assumed command of the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. He became responsible for celebrating its 100th anniversary. However, his most important task was converting the shipyard over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> nuclear submarines. In 1955 he became Chief of the Bureau of Ships, where he championed the adoption of the teardrop hull, and oversaw the design of nuclear submarines, cruisers and aircraft carriers.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} {{development of}} vector spaces is due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> function spaces by Lebesgue. This was later formalized by Banach and Hilbert, around 1920. At that time, algebra {{and the new}} field of functional analysis began to interact, notably with key concepts such as spaces of p-integrable functions and Hilbert spaces. Vector spaces, including infinite-dimensional ones, then became a firmly established notion, and many mathematical branches started making use of this concept.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} element in nation-building, {{the story of the}} heroic past, fell to such nationalist German historians as the liberal constitutionalist Friedrich Dahlmann (1785–1860), his conservative student Heinrich von Treitschke (1834–1896), and others less conservative, such as Theodor Mommsen (1817–1903) and Heinrich von Sybel (1817–1895), to name two. Dahlmann himself died before unification, but he laid the groundwork for the nationalist histories to come through his histories of the English and French revolutions, by casting these revolutions as fundamental <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> a nation, and Dahlmann himself viewed Prussia as the logical agent of unification.|$|E
5|$|At {{ground level}} {{and inside the}} lobby, bas-reliefs depict {{the origins of the}} Price company. During the 1920s John M. Lyle, an {{influential}} architect of the Beaux-arts school, was developing a uniquely Canadian fusion of French and English colonial styles, and his ideas were applied by designers Ross and Macdonald <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the Price Building. Each floor is symmetrically divided in two by a hallway, and a projection {{at the end of the}} building references the bow of a ship.|$|E
