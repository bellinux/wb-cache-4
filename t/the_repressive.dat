5|$|Richard Bonnie, a {{professor}} of law and medicine at the University of Virginia School of Law, mentioned the deformed nature of the Soviet psychiatric profession as one of the explanations for why it was so easily bent toward <b>the</b> <b>repressive</b> objectives of the state, and pointed out the importance of a civil society and, in particular, independent professional organizations separate and apart from the state {{as one of the most}} substantial lessons from the period.|$|E
5|$|The {{revolution}} in 1944 left {{many of the}} biggest opponents of organized labor unaffected, such as the landed elite and the United Fruit Company. The revolution, and election of Arévalo, nonetheless marked a significant shift in the fortunes of labor unions. The protests of 1944 strengthened the labor movement {{to the point where}} Ponce Vaides stopped enforcing <b>the</b> <b>repressive</b> vagrancy law, which was abolished in the 1945 constitution. On 1 May 1945, Arévalo made a speech celebrating organized labor, to a tremendously positive reception. The freedom of press guaranteed in the new constitution also drew much attention to the brutal working conditions in Guatemala City. From the beginning, the new unions that were formed fell into two camps, those that were communist and those that were not. <b>The</b> <b>repressive</b> policies of the Ubico government had driven both factions underground, but they re-emerged after the revolution.|$|E
5|$|By {{the age of}} fifteen, Coffin {{was helping}} his family assist {{escaping}} slaves by taking food {{to those who were}} hiding on his family's farm. As <b>the</b> <b>repressive</b> Fugitive Slave Act became more rigorously enforced, the Coffin family began to assist slaves in greater secrecy, doing most of their illegal activities at night. Scrutiny of the abolitionists only worsened {{with the passage of the}} 1804 Black Laws. By the early 1820s Quakers in North Carolina were being openly persecuted for the assistance they were suspected of providing to runaway slaves. In 1821 Coffin and his cousin, Vestal, established a Sunday School to teach slaves to read the Bible, but the plan was short-lived; slaveholders soon forced the school to close.|$|E

5|$|Sang Penari {{touches on}} the history of {{communism}} in Indonesia, focusing on the nation's communist party spreading its ideology and the government's purge of the Communist Party's members from 1965–1966, which is thought to have killed several hundred thousand. It is only the third Indonesian film to cover the killings, following Arifin C. Noer's G30S/PKI (1984) and Riri Riza's Gie (2005). Tohari later said that if he had written about the killings as they were depicted in the film, <b>the</b> <b>repressive</b> New Order government would have had him shot.|$|E
5|$|European traders had {{established}} outposts in the Indian subcontinent by the 17th century. Through overwhelming military strength, the British East India company subdued local kingdoms and established {{themselves as the}} dominant force by the 18th century. Following the First War of Independence of 1857, the Government of India Act 1858 led the British Crown to assume direct control of India. In the decades following, civic society gradually emerged across India, most notably the Indian National Congress Party, formed in 1885. The period after World War I was marked by British reforms such as the Montague–Chelmsford Reforms, but it also witnessed the enactment of <b>the</b> <b>repressive</b> Rowlatt Act and calls for self-rule by Indian activists. The discontent of this period crystallised into nationwide non-violent movements of non-cooperation and civil disobedience, led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.|$|E
5|$|For six years, Tamar was a co-ruler {{with her}} father upon whose death, in 1184, Tamar {{continued}} as the sole monarch and was crowned a second time at the Gelati cathedral near Kutaisi, western Georgia. She inherited a relatively strong kingdom, but the centrifugal tendencies fostered by the great nobles were far from being quelled. There was considerable opposition to Tamar's succession; this was sparked by a reaction against <b>the</b> <b>repressive</b> policies of her father and encouraged by the new sovereign's other perceived weakness, her sex. As Georgia had never previously had a female ruler, {{a part of the}} aristocracy questioned Tamar's legitimacy, while others tried to exploit her youth and supposed weakness to assert greater autonomy for themselves. The energetic involvement of Tamar's influential aunt Rusudan and the Georgian Catholicos-Patriarch Michael IV Mirianisdze was crucial for legitimizing Tamar's succession to the throne. However, the young queen was forced into making significant concessions to the aristocracy. She had to reward the Catholicos-Patriarch Michael's support by making him a chancellor, thus placing him at the top of both the clerical and secular hierarchies.|$|E

50|$|The potlatch ban {{was never}} entirely effective, {{though it did}} {{significant}} cultural damage, and continued underground through {{the period of the}} ban in a number of places and ways. The potlatch ban, and related banning of the sun dance and Coast Salish dancing, occurred during <b>the</b> height of <b>repressive</b> colonial laws in Canada, lasting until 1951.

5|$|In December 1829, Rosas became {{governor}} of the province of Buenos Aires and established a dictatorship backed by state terrorism. In 1831, he signed the Federal Pact, recognising provincial autonomy and creating the Argentine Confederation. When his term of office ended in 1832, Rosas departed to the frontier to wage war on the indigenous peoples. After his supporters launched a coup in Buenos Aires, Rosas was asked to return and once again took office as governor. Rosas reestablished his dictatorship and formed <b>the</b> <b>repressive</b> Mazorca, an armed parapolice that killed thousands of citizens. Elections became a farce, and the legislature and judiciary became docile instruments of his will. Rosas created a cult of personality and his regime became totalitarian in nature, with all aspects of society rigidly controlled.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the cast changes, the tone and pacing of the films was also matured and altered for comic effect. The films changed the petty crimes of the books into gruesome murders, that are often spearheaded by dangerous criminals. At {{the time of the}} films, Nancy and Ned/Ted's romance in the books was set aside for the main mystery; on the other hand, romance was a prominent theme of the films, with Nancy being portrayed as the domineering girlfriend, and Ted as <b>the</b> <b>repressive</b> boyfriend usually duped into another scheme. While book Nancy was usually treated with authority and equal respect to other adults, Nancy in the films was often chastised by adults for her habit to go into mysteries, and she often found herself at odds with her father and the police.|$|E

On the night of February 1516, Học and his remaining forces seized the nearby villages of Phu Duc and Vĩnh Bảo, in Thái Bình and Hải Dương provinces respectively, for a few hours. In the second village, the VNQDD killed the local mandarin of the French colonial government, Tri Huyen. On February 16, French warplanes responded by bombarding the VNQDD's last base at Co Am village; on the same day, Tonkin's Resident Superior René Robin dispatched 200 Gardes indigènes, eight French commanders and two Sûreté inspectors. A few further violent incidents occurred until February 22, when Governor-General Pierre Pasquier declared that the insurrection had been defeated. Học and his lieutenants, Chinh and Nguyen Thanh Loi, were apprehended.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>repressive</b> {{policies}} of the Ubico government resulted in a popular uprising led by university students and middle-class citizens in 1944. Ubico fled, handing over power to a three-person junta which continued Ubico's policies until it too was toppled, by the October Revolution that aimed to transform Guatemala into a liberal democracy. The largely free election that followed installed a philosophically conservative university professor, Juan José Arévalo, as the President of Guatemala. Arévalo's administration drafted a more liberal labor code, built health centers, and increased funding to education. Arévalo enacted a minimum wage, and created state-run farms to employ landless laborers. He also cracked down on the communist Guatemalan Party of Labour (Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo, PGT) and in 1945 criminalized all labor unions in workplaces with fewer than 500 workers. By 1947, the remaining unions had grown strong enough to pressure him into drafting a new labor code, which made workplace discrimination illegal and created health and safety standards. However, Arévalo refused to advocate land reform of any kind, and stopped short of drastically changing labor relations in the countryside.|$|E
5|$|From 1878 to 1890, the Anti-Socialist Laws forbade all socialist trade unions. Only small local organizations, which communicated via {{intermediaries}} such as stewards, {{who worked}} illegally or semi-legally, survived. This form of organization {{was easier to}} protect against state repression. After the laws were sunset in 1890, the General Commission of the Trade Unions of Germany was founded on November 17 {{at a conference in}} Berlin to centralize the socialist labor movement. In 1892, the Trade Union Congress of Halberstadt was held to organize the many local unions under the committee. The localists, 31,000 of whom were represented at the congress, wanted to retain many of the changes that had been adopted during <b>the</b> <b>repressive</b> period. For example, they opposed separate organizations for political and economic matters, such as the party and the trade union. They especially wanted to keep their grassroots democratic structures. They also advocated local trade unions being networked by delegates rather than ruled centrally, and were wary of bureaucratic structures. The localists' proposals were rejected at the Halberstadt congress, so they refused to join the centralized trade unions, which became known as the Free Trade Unions. They did not renounce social democracy, but rather considered themselves to be an avant-garde within the social democratic movement in Germany.|$|E
5|$|In May 1944 {{a series}} of protests against Ubico broke out at the {{university}} in Guatemala City. Ubico responded by suspending the constitution on June 22, 1944. The protests, which by this point included many middle-class members and junior army officers in addition to students and workers, gained momentum, eventually forcing Ubico's resignation {{at the end of}} June. Ubico appointed a three-person junta led by General Federico Ponce Vaides to succeed him. Although Ponce Vaides initially promised to hold free elections, when the congress met on July 3, soldiers held everyone at gunpoint and forced them to appoint Ponce Vaides interim president. <b>The</b> <b>repressive</b> policies of the Ubico administration were continued. Opposition groups began organizing again, this time joined by many prominent political and military leaders, who deemed the Ponce regime unconstitutional. Árbenz {{had been one of the}} few officers in the military to protest the actions of Ponce Vaides. Ubico had fired Árbenz from his teaching post at the Escuela Politécnica, and since then Árbenz had been living in ElSalvador, organizing a band of revolutionary exiles. Árbenz was one of the leaders of the plot within the army, along with Major Aldana Sandoval. Árbenz insisted that civilians also be included in the coup, over the protests of the other military men involved. Sandoval later said that all contact with the civilians during the coup was through Árbenz.|$|E
