5|$|As an {{homage to}} the venue, the stage was {{decorated}} with roses. The multi-leveled set-up consisted of New York City fire escape routes. Other parts of the stage had a ladder reaching the mezzanine floors and a replica of an F train carriage. Gaga's wardrobe was also rose themed, with leotards, hats and jackets, and instruments adorned with red roses.

5|$|By the 1960s the LPO had regained {{its earlier}} standards, and in 1964 it secured a {{valuable}} engagement {{to play in}} the Glyndebourne Festival opera house during the summer months. In 1993 it was appointed resident orchestra of the Royal Festival Hall on the south bank of the Thames, one of London's major concert venues. Since 1995 <b>the</b> <b>residency</b> has been jointly held with the Philharmonia.

5|$|In late May 2007, {{following}} the FBI raid, questions surfaced {{about whether or}} not Jew actually lived in his San Francisco home, and whether or not Jew therefore met <b>the</b> <b>residency</b> requirements of his supervisor position. The house in question (on 28th Avenue in the Sunset District) was owned by his father, though Jew's neighbors said that the house was vacant and utility bills showed little to no usage of water or electricity. Jew claimed that {{he spent most of his}} time at his flower shop, but was not able to provide more information in response to City Attorney Dennis Herrera's formal requests.|$|E
5|$|Later {{additions}} to <b>the</b> <b>residency</b> program include Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), Meredith's half-sister.

In Season twelve attending cardio surgeon Nathan Riggs (Martin Henderson) joins the show. In season thirteen, the hospital sees a shakeup when attending sports medicine/orthopedic surgeon Eliza Minnick (Marika Dominczyk) is hired as an educational consultant wanting to revamp <b>the</b> <b>residency</b> program. She is fired following the explosion at the hospital.|$|E

5|$|The state {{legislature}} {{passed a law}} shortening <b>the</b> <b>residency</b> requirement {{from one year to}} six months, which was signed into law by Democratic Governor Parris Glendening in April. Bell attempted to have the legislation overturned. The City Council, with Schmoke's support considered raising the salary of the mayor in April, to make the position more enticing to Mfume. Also, 200 Baltimore citizens, including three former mayors, attempted to draft Mfume into the race. However, Mfume had signed a five-year contract with the NAACP in 1996. Mfume considered leaving the NAACP to run, but in May, decided to remain with the organization.|$|E
5|$|Educational {{opportunities}} in emergency medicine {{are not available}} in many countries, and even when present, they are often in their infancy. Botswana opened its first medical school in 2009, with a program in emergency medicine following in 2011. The program aims to train four to six physicians in emergency medicine each year. Limitations on in-country training mean that the program includes six months of training at an international site. The organization {{of the program is}} modeled on South Africa's program due to the similarities in resource constraints and disease burdens and the eagerness of College of Emergency Medicine of South Africa and Emergency Medicine Society of South Africa to support the expansion of emergency medicine. Two years of clinical practice are required before entering <b>the</b> <b>residency</b> program, as in the South African and Australian approaches.|$|E
5|$|In 1791, under Sheridan's management, the {{building}} was demolished {{to make way for}} a larger theatre which opened in 1794. This new Drury Lane survived for 15 years before burning down in 1809. The building that stands today opened in 1812. It has been <b>the</b> <b>residency</b> of a number of well known actors including; Edmund Kean, comedian Dan Leno, and the musical composer and performer Ivor Novello. From the Second World War, the theatre has primarily hosted long runs of musicals, including Oklahoma! (1947–1953), My Fair Lady (1958–1963), 42nd Street (1984–1989) and Miss Saigon (1989–1999), the theatre's longest-running show. The theatre is owned by the composer Andrew Lloyd Webber.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} programme for the Independence Day celebrations {{began with}} a Te Deum at the Cathedral of Notre-Dame-du-Congo. The service began at 9:00 am, after which delegates returned to the Palais de la Nation which had been <b>the</b> <b>residency</b> of the Belgian Governor-General of the Congo. Some leading Congolese musicians, notably Joseph Kabaselleh and his band, Le Grand Kallé et l'African Jazz, performed specially-written songs commemorating independence there until 11:00 am. These included Indépendance Cha Cha, one of Kabaselleh's best-known works. After this, the official speeches - {{the main component of}} the day's festivities - began. In the audience were dignitaries from both Belgium and the Congo as well as the international press.|$|E
5|$|As Canada's {{starting}} goalkeeper at the 2008 CONCACAF Women's Olympic Qualifying Tournament in April, McLeod recorded three shutouts {{and allowed}} one {{goal in the}} final against the United States. The team's April 9 semi-final win over Mexico was her sixth clean sheet of the season, setting a national team record. She helped Canada set a CONCACAF record with 509 consecutive shutout minutes. Canada's second-place finish at the tournament earned the team a spot at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Following the Olympic Qualifying Tournament, McLeod started in two friendlies in May against the United States and Australia before the Peace Queen Cup in Korea in June. She recorded one shutout during the tournament. After the Peace Queen Cup, McLeod and Canada's women's national team resumed the Vancouver residency program for final preparations for the 2008 Women's Olympic Football Tournament. <b>The</b> <b>residency</b> included three friendlies in July against Brazil, New Zealand, and Singapore; McLeod started in the matches against New Zealand and Singapore and allowed two goals.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1959, Mona Best decided to open a club in her cellar, and offered the Les Stewart Quartet a {{residency}} if they would help convert the cellar. Harrison and fellow Quartet guitarist Ken Brown, however, missed a show, causing Les Stewart to fire the two and drop <b>the</b> <b>residency.</b> This caused distress to Best, but Harrison offered a solution: he recruited Lennon and McCartney to play, and they returned to calling themselves the Quarrymen. After helping Best finish converting the cellar, the new four guitarist line-up of the Quarrymen (Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, and Brown) opened the Casbah Coffee Club on 29 August 1959. The opening night performance was attended by about 300 local teenagers, but as the cellar had no air conditioning and people were dancing, the temperature rose until it became hard to breathe. The Quarrymen were afforded the use of Brown's three input amplifier (which, along with McCartney's Elpico, meant that all four guitarists were electric), and sang through one microphone connected to the club's small PA system.|$|E
5|$|Kruger's second volksraad sat for {{the first}} time in 1891. Any {{resolution}} it passed had to be ratified by the first volksraad; its role was in effect largely advisory. Uitlanders could vote in elections for the second volksraad after two years' residency on the condition they were naturalised as burghers—a process requiring the renunciation of any foreign allegiance. <b>The</b> <b>residency</b> qualification for naturalised burghers to join the first volksraad electorate was raised from five to 14 years, with the added criterion that they had to be at least 40 years old. During the close-run campaign for the 1893 election, in which Kruger was again challenged by Joubert with the Chief Justice John Gilbert Kotzé as a third candidate, the President indicated that he was prepared to lower the 14-year residency requirement so long as it would not risk the subversion of the state's independence. The electoral result was announced as 7,854 votes for Kruger, 7,009 for Joubert, and 81 for Kotzé. Joubert's supporters alleged procedural irregularities and demanded a recount; the ballots were counted twice more and although the results varied slightly each time, every count gave Kruger a majority. Joubert conceded and Kruger was inaugurated for the third time on 12 May 1893.|$|E
5|$|Madhoji Bhonsle, {{also known}} as Appa Saheb, {{consolidated}} his power in Nagpur after {{the murder of his}} cousin, the imbecile ruler Parsoji Bhonsle. He entered into a treaty with the British on 27 May 1816. He ignored the request of the British Resident Jenkins to refrain from contact with Baji Rao II. Jenkins asked Appa Saheb to disband his growing concentration of troops and come to <b>the</b> <b>residency,</b> which he also refused to do. Appa Saheb openly declared support for the Peshwa, who was already fighting the British near Pune. As it was now clear that a battle was in the offing, Jenkins asked for reinforcements from nearby British East India Company troops. He already had about 1,500 men under Lieutenant-Colonel Hopentoun Scott. Jenkins sent word for Colonel Adams to march to Nagpur with his troops. Like other Maratha leaders, Appa Shaeb employed Arabs in his army. They were typically involved in holding fortresses. While they were known to be among the bravest of troops, they were not amenable to discipline and order. The total strength of the Marathas was about 18,000.|$|E

5|$|The series follows Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), the {{daughter}} of an esteemed general surgeon named Ellis Grey, following her acceptance into <b>the</b> <b>residency</b> program at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital. During her time as a resident, Grey works alongside fellow doctors Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), and George O'Malley (T. R. Knight), who each struggle to balance their personal lives with the hectic work and training schedules. They are overseen during their internship by Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), a senior resident who works for attending Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), the head of neurosurgery and Meredith's love interest; Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington), the head of cardio who becomes Yang's fiancee; and Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), the Chief of Surgery and attending general surgeon, and lover of Ellis Grey decades ago.
