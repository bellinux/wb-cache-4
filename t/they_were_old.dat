5|$|For Pellew, {{the victory}} was an {{encouraging}} {{sign of the}} weakness of the Dutch squadron. In October, Captain Peter Rainier seized another Dutch frigate from Batavia harbour itself and the following month Admiral Pellew led a large scale raid on the port that eliminated most of the Dutch East Indies squadron. Two ships of the line escaped Pellew's attack, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>old</b> and in a poor state of repair, and so were unable to defend themselves when Pellew discovered and destroyed them at Griessie in 1807.|$|E
5|$|I said, 'Mr. Malcolm, {{could you}} tell me {{something}} about your mother?' And I will never, ever forget how he stopped almost as if he was suspended like a marionette. And he said, 'I remember the kind of dresses she used to wear. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>old</b> and faded and gray.' And then he walked some more. And he said, 'I remember how she was always bent over the stove, trying to stretch what little we had.' And that was the beginning, that night, of his walk. And he walked that floor until just about daybreak.|$|E
5|$|The C5's {{users were}} an eclectic group. They {{included}} holiday camps who wanted C5s to rent to campers; the British Royal Family – Princes William and Harry each had one {{to drive around}} Kensington Palace before <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>old</b> enough to drive; Sir Elton John, who had two; the magician Paul Daniels, who bought a demonstration model he saw being driven around the BBC Television Centre car park; Sir Arthur C. Clarke, who had two shipped out to his home at Colombo in Sri Lanka; and the Mayor of Scarborough, Michael Pitts, who swapped his official Daimler for a C5. However, as The Times reported, {{some of the early}} buyers were disappointed by the vehicle's limitations, citing its slowness, its limited range and its inability to cope with steep hills, which led some people to return their C5s and ask for a refund.|$|E

500|$|Although {{his plans}} were delayed by {{inadequate}} {{resources and the}} Vellore Mutiny in India, Pellew sent the frigate [...] to the Java Sea in July 1806. Greyhound intercepted and defeated a Dutch convoy {{off the coast of}} Sulawesi on 25 July and three months later the frigate [...] managed to capture the Dutch frigate [...] at the entrance to Batavia harbour. Following these successes, Pellew was able to bring his main force to bear on the island and in November 1806 launched a major raid on Batavia, destroying the remaining frigate and a number of minor warships from the Dutch squadron. The Dutch ships of the line had escaped prior to Pellew's attack to the harbour of Griessie near Surabaya, and although <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>old</b> and in a poor state of repair Pellew was forced to lead a second operation to Java in October 1807, capturing the port and eliminating the last Dutch naval forces in the east.|$|E
500|$|Alia Shawkat was {{the first}} cast in the series. Michael Cera, Tony Hale, and Jessica Walter were cast from video tapes and flown in to {{audition}} for Fox. Jason Bateman and Portia de Rossi both read and auditioned for the network and were immediately chosen. The character of Gob was apparently the most challenging to cast. When Will Arnett auditioned, he played the character [...] "like a guy who {{thought of himself as}} the chosen son, even though it was obvious to everyone else that he was the least favorite"; he was chosen immediately for his unique portrayal. The characters of Tobias and George Sr. were originally going to have minor roles, but David Cross and Jeffrey Tambor's portrayals mixed well {{with the rest of the}} characters, and they were given more significant parts. Howard provided the narration for the initial pilot, and his narrating meshed so well with the tone of the program that the decision was made to keep his voice. Howard also aided in the casting of [...] "Lucille 2"; the producers told him that their dream actress for the role was Liza Minnelli but assumed no one of her stature would take the part. She agreed when Ron Howard asked her himself, because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>old</b> friends; she had been his babysitter when he was a teenager.|$|E

500|$|The Royal Commission handed its {{findings}} and {{recommendations to the}} government in August 1913. It concluded that international relations were deteriorating in the Pacific {{and there was an}} increased risk of the NEI becoming involved in a war between western and Asian powers. As a result, the Commission argued that the Netherlands should develop a powerful fleet of warships to enforce Dutch neutrality and offer a credible defense should any nation attack the NEI or the home country itself. The Commission was very specific in its call for nine dreadnoughts, stating that they should be ships of , possessing a speed of , and mounting eight [...] guns, sixteen , and twelve [...] guns. It was also recommended that the fleet include six [...] "torpedo cruisers"—believed by Conways to be closer to large destroyers—eight [...] destroyers (a role which would be filled by the Fret class), eight torpedo boats (also already completed, though <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>old),</b> eight large submarines and two large minelayers. This ambitious plan was estimated to cost nearly ƒ17,000,000 each year for the next 35 (until 1949), adding up to about ƒ595,000,000; this would triple the Navy's budget. The Commission recommended that the cost of the fleet be partially offset by reducing the size of the Koninklijk Nederlands Indisch Leger (Royal Dutch East Indies Army) as the Navy would provide a stronger defense from attack than the Army could.|$|E
2500|$|Goebbels added a {{postscript}} to Hitler's last {{will and}} testament of 29 April stating {{that he would}} disobey the order to leave Berlin, [...] "or reasons of humanity and personal loyalty". Further, he stated that Magda and their children supported his refusal to leave Berlin and his resolution to die in the bunker. He later qualified this by stating that the children would support the decision [...] if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>old</b> enough to speak for themselves.|$|E
2500|$|Despite these concerns, no {{significant}} opposition to standard management arose until the mid-1990s, when {{a confluence of}} evidence and opinion from several sources led to a re-examination of outcomes. Several intersex support and advocacy groups (e.g., the Intersex Society of North America) began to publicly criticize infant genital surgery based on unsatisfactory outcomes of some adults who had been operated on as infants. Their complaints were that they had reduced ability to enjoy sexual relations or that they resented not having had the choice of gender assignment or surgical reconstruction left until <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>old</b> enough to participate. (See History of intersex surgery.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Until {{the middle}} of the 20th century, women {{commonly}} known as “granny midwives” attended most births in southern Appalachia. [...] They were members of the community and were not officially trained; they learned how to assist in birth by watching other midwives. [...] While the term “granny” implies that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>old,</b> this was not necessarily the case. [...] They attended births at home and eventually moved into clinics. [...] Eventually obstetricians and physicians entered the scene and more births were occurring outside the home. [...] While “granny midwives” are no longer common in southern Appalachia, direct-entry midwives still practice in certain communities.|$|E
2500|$|Gyllenhaal's {{appearance}} and especially his haircut {{for the role}} of the Prince were ridiculed by several sources, but Ghazzal Dabiri, a lecturer and coordinator of Iranian studies at Columbia University, said it was historically accurate, positively comparing the portrayal of Persians in the film to those of 300 and adding: [...] "An Iranian warrior-prince would have had those kinds of muscles! They did train in martial arts from very young ages. Some accounts say as soon as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>old</b> enough to be taught reading, writing, arithmetic, and so on, martial arts ... was part of their curriculum." ...|$|E
2500|$|Most of the {{big changes}} in program {{elements}} during {{the decade of the}} 1960s were in Cub Scouting, and were directed at retaining the oldest Cub Scouts who were dropping out before <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>old</b> enough to graduate to Boy Scouting. [...] In 1967, the Lion badge and traditional parent-directed advancement for 10-year olds was discarded for the new Webelos program, which became more focused on the transition to Boy Scouting. [...] The Webelos program introduced 15 topical activity badges alongside the Arrow of Light badge requirements. [...] A new Webelos colors badge was developed to hold the activity badge pins, and the hat and neckerchief featured the new Webelos symbol.

[...] He was separated from his father at birth and his father is never spoken of in all of their stories. [...] Raven was born, the third child of a woman whose previous two boys had killed by her uncle. [...] Each time the woman gave birth, her uncle would offer to each them to hunt once <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>old</b> enough; each time he would take them out on a canoe and trick them, he would instruct the boys {{to sit on the}} edge of the canoe, at which point he would rock the canoe, forcing them to fall into the water where he would leave them to drown.|$|E
2500|$|For each {{mother and}} child in the home, the County Council paid the nuns £1 a week. At {{the end of the}} year, the mothers left while their babies were {{typically}} kept at the Home. The children stayed there until they could be adopted, fostered, or until <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>old</b> enough to be sent to industrial boarding schools. [...] Even at the time, there were some complaints of fostered children being exploited. An October 1953 article in The Tuam Herald said [...] "an effort was not always made to find the home that most suited the child or the child that most suited the home. The allowance given to foster parents was not always spent on the child's welfare". [...] Local historian Catherine Corless also uncovered one case where a mother found work in England and paid the nuns to care for her son in the Home. The nuns did not tell her that her son had been fostered and [...] "kept each installment that she sent them." [...] Some babies were sent to clergy in the United States to be illegally adopted by Catholic families there.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{previous}} life, Maudgalyāyana {{was the only}} son born to his family. He was dutiful, {{and took care of}} all the household duties. As his parents aged, this increased his workload. His parents urged him to find a wife to help him, but he persistently refused, insisting on doing the work himself. After persistent urging from his mother, he eventually married. His wife looked after his elderly parents, but after a short period became hostile to them. She complained to her husband, but he paid no attention to this. One day, when he was outside the house, she scattered rubbish around and when he returned, blamed it on his blind parents. After continual complaints, he capitulated and agreed to deal with his parents. Telling his parents that their relatives in another region wished to see them, he led his parents onto a carriage and began driving the oxen cart through the forest. While {{in the depths of the}} forest, he dismounted and walked along with the carriage, telling his parents that he had to watch out for robbers, who were common in the area. He then impersonated the sounds and cries of thieves, pretending to attack the carriage. His parents told him to fend for himself, as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>old</b> and blind, and implored the [...] "thieves" [...] to leave their son. While they were crying out, he beat and killed his parents, and threw their bodies into the forest before returning home. In another version recorded in the commentary to the Pali Jātaka, Maudgalyāyana did not carry the murder through though, touched by the words of his parents.|$|E
