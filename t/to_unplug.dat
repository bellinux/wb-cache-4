25|$|A fire {{occurred}} in a Tesla Model S charging at a Tesla Supercharger in Norway on January 1, 2016. The fire was slow, and the owner had time <b>to</b> <b>unplug</b> the car and retrieve possessions. An investigation by the Norwegian Accident Investigation Board (AIBN) indicated that the fire originated in the car, but was otherwise inconclusive. In March 2016, Tesla stated that their own investigation into the incident concluded that the fire {{was caused by a}} short circuit in the vehicle's distribution box, but that the amount of damage prevented them from determining the exact cause. Tesla stated that the Supercharger detected the short circuit and deactivated, and a future Model S software update would stop the vehicle from charging if a short circuit is detected.|$|E

500|$|As free jazz {{spread in}} the 1960s, so did the use of tone clusters. In {{comparison}} with what John Litweiler describes as Taylor's [...] "endless forms and contrasts," [...] the solos of Muhal Richard Abrams employ tone clusters in a similarly free, but more lyrical, flowing context. Guitarist Sonny Sharrock made them {{a central part of}} his improvisations; in Palmer's description, he executed [...] "glass-shattering tone clusters that sounded like someone was ripping the pickups out of the guitar without having bothered <b>to</b> <b>unplug</b> it from its overdriven amplifier." [...] Pianist Marilyn Crispell has been another major free jazz proponent of the tone cluster, frequently in collaboration with Anthony Braxton, who played with Abrams early in his career. Since the 1990s, Matthew Shipp has built on Taylor's innovations with the form. European free jazz pianists who have contributed {{to the development of the}} tone cluster palette include Gunter Hampel and Alexander von Schlippenbach.|$|E
500|$|Lancaster, however, {{kept an eye}} on {{the public}} {{scrutiny}} surrounding Lopez. Olivier Van Doorne, worldwide creative director at Select Communications, said: [...] "Whenever you take a celebrity into a commercial venture, which {{more and more people are}} doing, there's enormous risk [...] It doesn't take much to turn the public around overnight." [...] Mark Malinowski, director for entertainment marketing at Ketchum, part of the Omnicom, said the situation [...] "will reach a point where, like anything else, there may be overexposure". Lancaster's marketing vice president Catherine Walsh remarked in a statement: [...] "The worst thing in the world would be <b>to</b> <b>unplug</b> Glow to introduce Still". Still Jennifer Lopez was released in October 2003. While Glow by JLo was aimed at the female market at girls between the age of 15 and 25, Still Jennifer Lopez was aimed to appeal to an older demographic of females 25 and above, according to Rebecca Murray of About.com.|$|E
500|$|In early 2000, {{the clock}} {{started to run}} {{backward}} because the national debt was actually decreasing. It showed a national debt of $5.7 billion and an individual family share of almost $74,000. With the original purpose of the clock being to highlight the rising debt, the reversal of the figures gave a mixed message, added {{to the fact that}} the display not being designed to properly run backward. In May 2000, it was reported that the clock was planned to be unplugged on September 7, 2000, what would have been Seymour Durst's 87th birthday. Douglas said that the decision <b>to</b> <b>unplug</b> the clock was made because [...] "it was put up to focus attention on the increasing national debt, and it's served its purpose." [...] In September, the clock was unplugged and covered with a red-white-and-blue curtain, with the national debt standing at roughly 5.7 trillion dollars. However, less than two years later in July 2002, the curtain was raised and the clock once again picked up tracking a rising debt, starting at 6.1 trillion dollars.|$|E

While Presley's {{character}} and his band, the [...] "Three Blazes", play a ballad at a Frankfurt nightclub ("Doin' the Best I Can", by Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman), a bored GI plays Presley's version of [...] "Blue Suede Shoes" [...] on the jukebox, remarking that he wants [...] "to hear an original". When another soldier tries <b>to</b> <b>unplug</b> the jukebox, the audience erupts in a fight. This studio re-recording {{was one of the}} few occasions in Presley's career in which he agreed to re-record a previously issued song. He did it on this occasion because the rest of the soundtrack was recorded in stereo, and thus a stereo version of [...] "Blue Suede Shoes" [...] was required. The 1960 version uses virtually the same arrangement as the 1956 recording. This version was included on the soundtrack album to G.I. Blues but was never released as a single in the United States.|$|E

40|$|The present {{analysis}} {{focuses on}} fluidisation and erosion processes involving hydromechanically unstable granular materials in artesian flow conditions, as these phenomena were documented in column tests with gap-graded soils by Skempton & Brogan.

For the description of the erosion process a continuum theory for three-phase media consisting of stationary grains, transported grains and pore fluid is presented. The governing mass balance and momentum balance equations, and the constitutive law for particle erosion are formulated and discussed in the light of the experimental evidence...|$|R
