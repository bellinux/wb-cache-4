40|$|The {{phosphorus}} {{activation coefficient}} (PAC, {{the ratio of}} available P to total P) is an important indicator of soil P availability and the transformation of P fractions. Understanding {{the details of the}} PAC is useful to estimate soil available P status and to provide P management guidance. In this research, soils from five long-term (23 years) fertilization treatments in three croplands were selected to examine the relationships between the PAC and P fractions and to analyse the influencing factors. PAC was affected by both soil types and fertilization treatments. Compared to the unfertilized control (CK) treatment, long-term P application significantly increased the PAC, all of the inorganic P (Pi) fractions and most of the organic P (Po) fractions in all the three soils, particularly in chemical fertilizer combined with manure treatment (<b>NPKM).</b> <b>The</b> PAC <b>was</b> significantly correlated to all of the Pi fractions proportions (P< 0. 05) except for Dil. HCl-Pi and Conc. HCl-Pi. Compared with CK, the chemical P and chemical P combined with manure treatments increased the ratio of total Pi fractions to total Po fractions (Pit/Pot); furthermore, <b>NPKM</b> significantly increased <b>the</b> organic C (Co) content and decreased the Co/Pot ratio. Stepwise multiple regressions showed that PAC = 0. 93 Co+ 0. 69 Pit/Pot- 0. 07 Co/Pot- 0. 27 CaCO 3 - 3. 79 (R 2 = 0. 924, P< 0. 001). In addition, the variance partitioning analysis showed that more variance of PAC is explained by soil factors (29. 53 %) than by P input (0. 19 %) and climate (0. 25 %) factors. Our findings demonstrate that P application increased the PAC by changing the Co content and the proportion of P fractions. Moreover, soil factors were the most important drivers of P transformations, and <b>NPKM</b> <b>was</b> optimal for improving soil fertility in Chinese croplands...|$|R
40|$|Mineral binding {{is a major}} {{mechanism}} for soil carbon (C) stabilization. However, the submicron information about the in situ mechanisms of different fertilization practices affecting organo-mineral complexes and associated C preservation remains unclear. Here, we applied nano-scale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS) to examine differentiating effects of inorganic versus organic fertilization on interactions between highly reactive minerals and soil C preservation. To examine such interactions, soils and their extracted colloids were collected during a 24 -year long-term fertilization period (1990 – 2014) (no fertilization, control; chemical nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) fertilization, NPK; and NPK plus swine manure fertilization, <b>NPKM).</b> <b>The</b> results for different fertilization conditions showed a ranked soil organic matter concentration with NPKM > NPK > control. Meanwhile, oxalate-extracted Al (Al o), Fe (Fe o), short-range ordered Al (Al xps), Fe (Fe xps), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) ranked with <b>NPKM</b> > control > NPK, but <b>the</b> ratios of DOC ∕ Al xps and DOC ∕ Fe xps ranked with NPKM > NPK > control. Compared with the NPK treatment, <b>the</b> <b>NPKM</b> treatment enhanced <b>the</b> C-binding loadings of Al and Fe minerals in soil colloids at the submicron scale. Furthermore, a greater concentration of highly reactive Al and Fe minerals <b>was</b> presented under <b>NPKM</b> than under NPK. Together, these submicron-scale findings suggest that both the reactive mineral species and their associations with C are differentially affected by 24 -year long-term inorganic and organic fertilization...|$|R
40|$|Improving {{water use}} {{efficiency}} (WUE) and soil fertility is relevant for apple production in drylands. The effects of intercrop-mulch (IM) of crown vetch (Coronilla varia L.) combined with different fertilizer treatments on WUE of apple trees and soil fertility of apple orchards were assessed {{over three years}} (2011, 2013 and 2014). A split-plot design was adopted, in which the main treatments were IM and no intercrop-mulch (NIM). Five sub-treatments were established: no fertilization (CK); nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer (NP); manure (M); N, P and potassium fertilizer (NPK); and NPK fertilizer combined with manure (NPKM). Due to mowing and mulching each month during July–September, the evapotranspiration for IM was 17. 3 % {{lower than that of}} NIM in the dry year of 2013. Additionally, the soil water storage of <b>NPKM</b> treatment <b>was</b> higher than that of CK during the experimental period. Thus, single fruit weight and fruit number per tree increased with IM and NPKM application. Moreover, applying NPKM with IM resulted in the highest yield (on average of three years), which was 73. 25 % and 130. 51 % greater than that of CK in IM and NIM, respectively. <b>The</b> WUE of <b>NPKM</b> combined with IM was also the highest in 2013 and 2014 (47. 69 and 56. 95 % greater than applying IM alone). In addition, due to application of IM combined with NPKM, soil organic matter was increased by 25. 8 % compared with that of CK (in NIM). Additionally, application of IM combined with NPKM obtained more economic net return, compared to other combinations. Therefore, applying <b>NPKM</b> with IM <b>is</b> recommended for improving apple production in this rain-fed agricultural area...|$|R
40|$|To better {{understand}} the role that fertilization systems play in soil fertility buildup and evolution, we employed {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) to determine the influence of different fertilization treatments on archaeal community structure in calcareous purplish paddy soil under rice/wheat rotations. The eight fertilization treatments were as follows: manure only (M), nitrogen plus manure (NM), nitrogen and phosphorus plus manure (NPM), nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium plus manure (NPKM), without fertilization (CK), mineral nitrogen (N), nitrogen-phosphorus (NP) and nitrogen, and phosphorus and potassium (NPK). Our results showed that long-term fertilization significantly affected soil archaeal community structure; the richness and diversity of archaeal community under NM, NP and <b>NPKM</b> <b>were</b> lower than those under the other fertilization treatments (M, NPM, CK, N, and NPK). Based on the DGGE patterns, two soil DNA samples isolated from the NPK-amended soil were used for RFLP analysis of archaea. Phylogenetic analyses showed that archaea in the calcareous purplish paddy soil was highly diverse, and the sequences were closely related to those archaeal sequences isolated from various soils and water environment. Cluster analysis of the DGGE profiles showed that archaeal communities under the eight fertilization treatments clustered into three groups. In soil from paddies currently under rice cultivation, the archaeal communities in the soil amended with M and NPK grouped into the first cluster, while NP was in the second group, and NPKM, NM, CK, N and NPM were in the third. In the soil with wheat cultivation, NP-treated archaeal communities clustered into a cluster, <b>NPKM</b> and M <b>were</b> in the second cluster, and N, NPK, NM, NPM and CK soil communities comprised the third cluster. The cluster analysis showed that crop type impacts the community structure of soil archaea...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the effects}} of {{external}} organic and inorganic components on soil fertility and quality is essential for improving low-yielding soils. We conducted a field study over two consecutive rice growing seasons to investigate the effect of applying chemical fertilizer (NPK), NPK plus green manure (NPKG), NPK plus pig manure (NPKM), and NPK plus straw (NPKS) on the soil nutrient status, enzyme activities involved in C, N, P, and S cycling, microbial community and rice yields of yellow clayey soil. Results showed that the fertilized treatments significantly improved rice yields over the first three experimental seasons. Compared with the NPK treatment, organic amendments produced more favorable effects on soil productivity. Notably, <b>the</b> <b>NPKM</b> treatment exhibited <b>the</b> highest levels of nutrient availability, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), activities of most enzymes and the microbial community. This resulted in the highest soil quality index (SQI) and rice yield, indicating better soil fertility and quality. Significant differences in enzyme activities and the microbial community were observed among the treatments, and redundancy analysis showed that MBC and available N were the key determinants affecting the soil enzyme activities and microbial community. The SQI score of the non-fertilized control (0. 72) was {{comparable to that of}} the NPK (0. 77), NPKG (0. 81) and NPKS (0. 79) treatments but significantly lower compared with <b>NPKM</b> (0. 85). <b>The</b> significant correlation between rice yield and SQI suggests that SQI can be a useful to quantify soil quality changes caused by different agricultural management practices. The results indicate that application of NPK plus pig manure is the preferred option to enhance SOC accumulation, improve soil fertility and quality, and increase rice yield in yellow clayey soil...|$|R
40|$|Phosphorus (P) {{is a major}} {{limiting}} nutrient {{for plant}} growth. P, as a nonrenewable resource and the controlling factor of aquatic entrophication, is critical for food security and human future, and concerns sustainable resource use and environmental impacts. It is thus essential to find an integrated and effective approach to optimize phosphorus fertilizer application in the agro-ecosystem while maintaining crop yield and minimizing environmental risk. Crop P models {{have been used to}} simulate plant-soil interactions but are rarely validated with scattered long-term fertilizer control field experiments. We employed a process-based model named Environmental Policy Integrated Climate model (EPIC) to simulate grain yield, soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil available P based upon 8 field experiments in China with 11 years dataset, representing the typical Chinese soil types and agro-ecosystems of different regions. 4 treatments, including N, P, and K fertilizer (NPK), no fertilizer (CK), N and K fertilizer (NK) and N, P, K and manure (<b>NPKM)</b> <b>were</b> measured and modelled. A series of sensitivity tests were conducted to analyze the sensitivity of grain yields and soil available P to sequential fertilizer rates in typical humid, normal and drought years. Our results indicated that the EPIC model showed a significant agreement for simulating grain yields with R 2 = 0. 72, index of agreement (d) = 0. 87, modeling efficiency (EF) = 0. 68, p< 0. 01 and SOC with R 2 = 0. 70, d= 0. 86, EF= 0. 59, and p< 0. 01. EPIC can well simulate soil available P moderately and capture the temporal changes in soil P reservoirs. Both of Crop yields and soil available were found more sensitive to the fertilizer P rates in humid than drought year and soil available P is closely linked to concentrated rainfall. This study concludes that EPIC model has great potential to simulate the P cycle in croplands in China and can explore the optimum management practices...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEpisturmian {{words are}} a {{suitable}} generalization to arbitrary alphabets of Sturmian words. In this paper {{we are interested}} in the problem of enumerating the palindromes in all episturmian words over a k-letter alphabet Ak. We give a formula for the map gk giving for any n the number of all palindromes of length n in all episturmian words over Ak. This formula extends to k> 2 a similar result obtained for k= 2 by the second and third authors in 2006. The map gk is expressed in terms of the map Pk counting for each n the palindromic prefixes of all standard episturmian words (epicentral words). For any n≥ 0, P 2 (n) =φ(n+ 2), where φ is the totient Euler function. The map Pk plays an essential role also in the enumeration formula for the map λk counting for each n the finite episturmian words over Ak. Similarly to Euler’s function, the behavior of Pk is quite irregular. The first values of Pk and of the related maps gk, and λk for 3 ≤k≤ 6 have been calculated and reported in the paper. Some properties of Pk are shown. In particular, broad upper and lower bounds for Pk, as well as for ∑m= 0 <b>nPk(m)</b> and gk, <b>are</b> determined. Finally, some conjectures concerning the map Pk are formulated...|$|R
40|$|Microbial biomass C and N {{content and}} {{analysis}} of soil bacteria with different fertilization systems were carried out based on a 15 -year long term fertilizer experiment in Drab Fluvo-aquic soil in Beijing. At this site, 13 different treatments were established in 1990. Six treatments were chosen for this work: Four were in a wheat-maize rotation receiving either no fertilizer (Ck), mineral fertilizers mineral fertilizers plus farmyard manure (Npkm) or mineral fertilizers with maize straw incorporated One was in a wheat-maize/wheat-soybean rotation receiving (NPK Npkf). The other was abandoned arable land (Cko) growing weeds. The amount of chemical fertilizer per year was N 150 kg hm, P 075 kghm; K 0 45 kg hm; manure 22. 5 t hm and maize straw 2. 25 t hm. The results showed that microbial biomass C and N in the abandoned arable soil were higher than that in arable soils. Soil microbial biomass C and N in treatments with fertilizer input NPK, NPKM, NPKSt and NPKF were higher than that in CK ^without fertilization). The rotation of wheat-maize/wheat-soybean had higher microbial biomass C and N than continuous wheat-maize cropping. The ratio of microbial C to soil organic C (SMB-C/S 0 C) and microbial N to soil total N (SMB-N/TN) had similar trends to SMB-C and SMB-N. The community structure of bacteria microorganisms was assessed by {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} DGGE) and Unweighted Pair Group Method Clustering (UPGMC) analysis of the DGGE banding patterns showing that the bacterial community structure was affected by the treatments. The results indicated a significant increase in microbial diversity by fertilization treatments compared to that without fertilizer (CK). However the composition of the bacterial community in <b>NPKM</b> treatment <b>was</b> more complex than that in others. Cluster analysis of the DGGE profiles pointed out that bacteria in the six soils belonged to three clusters. Bacterial communities in CK and NPK soils belonged to one cluster; those in NPKF and CK 0 soils to another cluster; and that in NPKSt and NPKM soil to a single cluster. The similarity of bacterial community in soils with six treatments was 53 %.

40|$|Few {{systematic}} {{studies have}} been carried out on integrated N balance in extremely arid oasis agricultural areas. A two-year field experiment was conducted to evaluate the N input and output balances under long-term fertilization conditions. Five treatments were chosen, namely CK (no fertilizer), NPK, NPKS (10 % straw return N and 90 % chemical N), NPKM (one third urea-N, two thirds sheep manure) and NPKM+ (1. 5 times <b>NPKM).</b> <b>The</b> results show an abundance of dry and wet N deposition (33 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1) in this area. All treatments (excluding CK) showed no significant difference in wheat production (P> 0. 05). NPKM gave higher cotton yields (P< 0. 05). In both crops, NPKM and NPKS treatments had a relatively higher N harvest index (NHI). 15 N-labeled results reveal that the fertilizer N in all N treatments leached to< 1 m depth and a high proportion of fertilizer-N remained in the top 60 cm of the soil profile. The NPKM+ treatment had the highest residual soil mineral N (Nmin, 558 kg Nd ha- 1), and NPKM and NPKS treatments had relatively low soil Nmin values (275 and 293 kg N ha- 1, respectively). Most of the treatments exhibited very high apparent N losses, especially the NPKM+ treatment (369 kg N ha- 1). Our arid research area had a strikingly high N loss compared to less arid agricultural areas. Nitrogen inputs therefore need careful reconsideration, especially the initial soil Nmin, fertilizer N inputs, dry and wet deposition, and appropriate organic and straw inputs which are all factors that {{must be taken into account}} under very arid conditions...|$|R

Macro-aggregates are more susceptible to disruptive forces induced by cultivation, which are less than micro-aggregates. Compared to no fertilizer application treatment (CK), long-term fertilizer application (NPK, NPKM and NPKS) had a significant influence on aggregate size distribution and aggregate stability, and had most effectively accelerate the formation of groups of > 2 mm and 0. 25 - 2 mm aggregates, that show the newly enriched organic carbon mostly appeared in aggregate fractions > 2 mm and 0. 25 - 2 mm.

40|$|The Olsen {{phosphorus}} (P) {{concentration of}} a soil {{is a key}} index {{that can be used}} to evaluate the P supply capacity of the soil and to estimate the optimal P fertilization rate. A study of the relationship between the soil Olsen P concentration and the P balance (P input minus P output) and their variations among different fertilization patterns will help to provide useful information for proper management of P fertilization. In this paper, the two investigated long-term experiments were established on black soils in the northeast region of China. Six fertilization treatments were selected: (1) unfertilized (CK); (2) nitrogen only (N); (3) nitrogen and potassium (NK); (4) nitrogen and phosphorus (NP); (5) nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK); and (6) nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and manure (<b>NPKM).</b> <b>The</b> results showed that the average Olsen P concentrations in the black soils at Gongzhuling and Harbin (16 - and 31 -year study periods, respectively), decreased by 0. 49 and 0. 56 mg kg- 1 a- 1, respectively, without P addition and increased by 3. 17 and 1. 78 mg kg- 1 a- 1, respectively, with P fertilization. The changes in soil Olsen P concentrations were significantly (P< 0. 05) correlated with the P balances at both sites except for the NP and NPK treatments at Gongzhuling. Under an average deficit of 100 kg ha- 1 P, the soil Olsen P concentration at both sites decreased by 1. 36 ~ 3. 35 mg kg- 1 in the treatments without P addition and increased by 4. 80 ~ 16. 04 mg kg- 1 in the treatments with 100 kg ha- 1 of P accumulation. In addition, the changes in Olsen P concentrations in the soil with 100 kg ha- 1 of P balance were significantly correlated with the P activation coefficient (PAC, percentage of Olsen P to total P, r= 0. 99, P< 0. 01) and soil organic matter content (r= 0. 91, P< 0. 01).
