5|$|During the series, Boycott became {{concerned}} with his form and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> dropped {{before he could}} chase Sobers' record in the upcoming tour of India. He had scored only 10 and 37 in the Fifth Test, however in the drawn Sixth Test at The Oval he scored 137, passing Colin Cowdrey's record of 7624 runs and becoming England's highest run-scorer. He ended the series behind only Botham, with 392 runs at 32.66.|$|E
5|$|In February 2011, Warner Bros. {{announced}} plans to produce a new feature film adaptation of The Stand. King commented {{that he would like}} to see Dutch actor Rutger Hauer in the role of Flagg, but conceded <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> too old for the part. In August 2014 it was reported that Warner Bros. wanted actor Matthew McConaughey for the role.|$|E
5|$|The {{identity}} {{of the old man}} remains unclear, though context implies <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> Pattern Recognition's protagonist Cayce Pollard's father, having removed himself from the channels of normal life to focus on disrupting what he sees as criminal elements operating in the United States Government.|$|E
50|$|Some {{internet}} sleuths {{have suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> the Zodiac killer as he resembled police sketches of the Zodiac {{and lived in}} California, where the Zodiac operated. Another theory is <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was Steven Campbell, an engineer from Cheyenne, Wyoming wanted for attempted murder. Authorities have also considered <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> a German soldier during WW2, who later escaped to the United States.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{his defeat}} of Metatron {{and access to}} Heaven having been restored, Castiel {{continues}} to face challenges on a personal and large scale, as some angels prefer to remain on Earth and his stolen Grace continues to consume him. Although Metatron has hinted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> able to help Castiel with a remaining fragment of his original Grace, Castiel has rejected the option of making a deal with Metatron to save his own life. Sam and Dean remain ignorant of Castiel's fate, although Crowley is aware of Castiel's condition, at one point killing another angel to transfer her Grace to Castiel so that Castiel could help Sam cure the now-demonic Dean after he was transformed by the Mark of Cain.|$|E
5|$|Hooper {{was born}} in England but has not {{represented}} the national team at any level. In March 2011 it was thought <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> eligible to represent Scotland. However, this possibility was later closed off. Since his move to Celtic he has been considered for England duty and was called up to the under-21 squad for a friendly but had to pull out due to injury. He was then included in the provisional squad for the 2011 European Under-21 Championship but {{did not go to}} the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Jon Snow, Sansa Stark, Tormund Giantsbane and Davos Seaworth {{meet with}} Ramsay Bolton and his {{advisers}} before the battle. Ramsay offers to pardon Jon for breaking his Night's Watch vows if he hands Sansa over. Jon offers to settle their dispute with single combat; Ramsay refuses, saying <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> unable to defeat Jon but the Bolton army can beat the Stark loyalists. When Smalljon Umber proves that Rickon Stark is captured by presenting Shaggydog's head, Sansa tells Ramsay that he will die {{the next day and}} rides off. Ramsay gloats that he has been starving his hounds in anticipation of feeding them Jon {{and his advisers}}.|$|E

5|$|The Tripurarahasya, a south Indian Shakta text, retells the story, {{giving more}} {{importance}} to the Goddess. When Shiva wishes to see Vishnu's Mohini form again, Vishnu fears <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> burned to ashes like Kamadeva by the ascetic Shiva. So, Vishnu prays to goddess Tripura, who grants half of her beauty to Vishnu, begetting the Mohini-form. As Shiva touches Mohini, his seed spills, indicating a loss of the merit gained through of all his austerities.|$|E
5|$|The Cabildo {{rejected}} Cisneros' resignation, {{and ordered}} the military to control the crowd and enforce {{the resolution of the}} previous day. The commanders pointed out that if they did so, their soldiers would mutiny. As the demonstration overran some sections of the cabildo, Cisneros' resignation was finally accepted. The members of the new Junta were the result of a document with hundreds of signatures, drafted among the people in the plaza. Cornelio Saavedra was the president of this Junta. He rejected this at first, fearing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> suspected of promoting the revolution for personal interest, but finally accepted at Cisneros' request. As the Junta was established on May 25, the other cities were invited to send deputies to a constituent assembly to discuss the type of government; on May 27, they were invited to send deputies to join the Junta. Both invitations were contradictory, but the consequences would take place some months later.|$|E
5|$|When {{the series}} begins, Allen is about 15 years old. Although {{most of his}} colleagues assume he is ageing normally, one of his enemies (Nea, who later {{possesses}} his body), suspects <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> growing younger. Allen is often accompanied by Timcampy, a small flying golem given him by his mentor (Exorcist general Cross Marian). As {{a result of the}} trauma of attempting to revive his guardian, Mana Walker, Allen's reddish-brown hair becomes white. Mana's curse of the boy's left eye allows Allen to distinguish Akuma from humans. Allen is devoted to helping the Akuma find peace until he meets the Exorcists of the Black Order, who become his friends. Realizing that he fights to save the souls of the Akuma and for his human friends, he devotes himself equally to both causes. Allen's master, Cross Marian, notes that the boy (originally cynical and rude), has adopted Mana's formal speech, mannerisms and personality. Allen begins to speak less formally during the series, reverting to his speech before he met Mana.|$|E

5|$|Andriamampandry {{tried on}} several {{occasions}} to warn Andriamasinavalona {{of the danger of}} administering the kingdom in this way. In one instance, he placed a hen {{in the middle of a}} room, then set one red rooster free in each corner. The roosters attacked one another viciously, leaving the king speechless. On another day, the elder brought four eagles to the king in a basket. When the basket was opened, the eagles flew wildly about the room, creating havoc. Andriamampandry warned the king that his realm would be no better off once his four sons got a taste of power. Andriamasinavalona recognized the danger but could not bear to choose which among his sons should be excluded from having a part in the decision-making responsibilities of the kingdom, so ignored the elder's advice. Finally Andriamampandry decided to give the king a very explicit warning. Andriamasinavalona had gathered his people in Andohalo to give a speech, when Andriamampandry set a bull loose into the crowd. In the panic that ensued, numerous people were gored or trampled to death, several pregnant women miscarried, and the gathering dispersed in chaos. The king demanded to know who had loosed the bull so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> executed, but when Andriamampandry took responsibility he warned the king that yet more blood would be spilled before the earth would be quenched. He then criticized the king for his concern over the relatively few deaths at the gathering, in light of the number of people who would die as a consequence of his division of Imerina. He further predicted that the prince at Ambohimanga would unite Imerina and lead it back to greatness. Andriamasinavalona reportedly had no response to give Andriamampandry, but instead hung his head in shame.|$|E
5|$|Paul's nephew, Daniel (Tim Phillipps), {{arrives in}} town and agrees to stay with him. Paul re-opens Charlie's and announces {{that it has been}} renamed The Waterhole, a name chosen by Kate before she died. After {{purchasing}} a painting from Naomi Canning (Morgana O'Reilly), Paul learns from the police that its ownership is disputed. He asks Naomi for his money back, but she tells him she has spent it. Paul then asks Naomi to have sex with him, in exchange for him not pressing charges against her. Naomi blackmails Paul into dropping the charges. Paul and Mark join forces to find Kate's killer. Matt Turner (Josef Brown) informs Paul that Victor Cleary (Richard Sutherland), Gus's younger brother, has become a suspect in Kate's murder. Paul realises <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> responsible for Kate's death. He buys a gun and meets with Victor who taunts Paul about killing Kate, before Matt and Mark arrive. Mark tackles Paul and Matt arrests Victor. Paul develops depression, knowing that his actions were responsible for Kate's death, and Terese tries to help him. After a public meltdown, Paul is suspended as mayor. He begins volunteering at Sonya's (Eve Morey) garden nursery, while Lucy also helps him overcome his grief.|$|E
