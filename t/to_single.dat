5|$|After Winterbourne Stoke {{the route}} once again becomes dual {{carriageway}} from Yarnbury Castle {{and across the}} Wylye valley, meeting the A36 at Deptford. There is then another section of single carriageway road, {{coming out of the}} valley and up to the crest of the Great Ridge, before a further section of dual two lane road down from the hill crest near Berwick St Leonard. On reaching the valley, it reverts again <b>to</b> <b>single</b> carriageway and through the village of Chicklade, before following the terrain over to Mere, where it runs north of the town as another dual carriageway bypass. Continuing west, it passes south of Wincanton and then north of Sparkford to a roundabout where the road reverts once more <b>to</b> <b>single</b> carriageway.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the 1965 Supreme Court {{decision}} Griswold v.

5|$|Rogerstone {{station is}} miles (2km) {{southeast}} of Risca and Pontymister station, and miles (6km) {{northwest of the}} South Wales Main Line. The station has one platform: the line reverts <b>to</b> <b>single</b> track after having passed Risca. Near the platform is a pick up/set down lay-by. Rogerstone station's car park has 64 spaces.|$|E
5|$|According to a latter {{episode of}} the Devi Mahatmya that deals with {{the killing of the}} demon Raktabija, the warrior-goddess Durga creates the Matrikas from herself and with their help slaughters the demon army. When the demon Shumbha {{challenges}} Durga <b>to</b> <b>single</b> combat, she absorbs the Matrikas into herself. In the Vamana Purana, the Matrikas arise from different parts of the Divine Mother Chandika; Varahi arises from Chandika's back.|$|E
5|$|Bouvet was {{the last}} member {{of a group of}} five battleships built to a broadly similar design, but {{different}} enough to be considered unique vessels. The first ship was , which formed the basis for Bouvet and three other ships. Design specifications were identical for each of the ships, but different engineers designed each vessel. The ships were based on the previous battleship , but instead of mounting the main battery all on the centerline, the ships used the lozenge arrangement of the earlier vessel , which moved two of the main battery guns <b>to</b> <b>single</b> turrets on the wings. The five ships were built in response to the British s.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the newly formed Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) began subsidizing northside {{commuter}} rail operations in the late 1960s, both the Lexington Branch and the Central Mass Branch had been reduced <b>to</b> <b>single</b> rush hour round trips on poorly maintained track. The South Sudbury run on the Central Mass was terminated on November 26, 1971. The Bedford round trip on the Lexington Branch ended after a major snowstorm on January 10, 1977, leaving the Fitchburg Line (with multiple daily round trips) as the only rail service at Cambridge station.|$|E
5|$|Carnot was {{the second}} member {{of a group of}} five battleships built to a broadly similar design, but {{different}} enough to be considered unique vessels. The first ship was Charles Martel, which formed the basis for Carnot and three other ships. Design specifications were identical for each of the ships, but different engineers designed each vessel. The ships were based on the previous battleship Brennus, but instead of mounting the main battery all on the centerline, the ships used the lozenge arrangement of the earlier vessel Magenta, which moved two of the main battery guns <b>to</b> <b>single</b> turrets on the wings. The five ships were built in response to the British s.|$|E

Homer accompanies Ned back {{home after the}} funeral and talks with him later that night when Ned is unable to sleep due to his {{loneliness}} and now having to raise his sons alone. To help him get on with his life, Homer secretly makes a videotape of Ned to show <b>to</b> <b>single</b> girls across Springfield. Ned gets to date several women thanks to the tape, including Lindsey Naegle and Edna Krabappel, {{but none of them}} are successful.|$|E
5|$|Florida {{strangler}} figs (Ficus aurea) {{are common}} in hammocks, and find particular ease in rooting at the heads of cabbage palms (Sabal palmetto). After taking root into the ground, they build complex frameworks around the host tree, eventually squeezing out light and nutrients, and essentially taking its place. A variety of invertebrates including beetles, ants, spiders, and tree snails support a food chain that includes frogs, owls and other birds of prey, snakes, rodents, bobcats, and raccoons. There are more than 50varieties of tree snails in the Everglades; the color patterns and designs unique <b>to</b> <b>single</b> islands may {{be a result of}} the isolation of certain hammocks.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>single</b> proteins, other protein complexes {{interact with}} the exosome. One of those is the cytoplasmic Ski complex, which includes an RNA helicase (Ski2) and is involved in mRNA degradation. In the nucleus, the processing of rRNA and snoRNA by the exosome is mediated by the TRAMP complex, which contains both RNA helicase (Mtr4) and polyadenylation (Trf4) activity.|$|E

5|$|Lords of Shadow is a third-person action-adventure game {{in which}} the player {{controls}} the main character, Gabriel Belmont. The combat involves a retractable chain whip called the Combat Cross. The player can perform up to forty unlockable combos with it. The commands consist of direct attacks for dealing damage <b>to</b> <b>single</b> enemies, and weak area attacks when surrounded by them. It is also capable of interactions with secondary weapons, such as knives, holy water and other items which can be upgraded. In addition, the Combat Cross's melee skills can be combined with the Light and Shadow magic system, which are spells aimed at defense and aggression, respectively. The whip is upgradeable and {{can also be used}} to guard against an opponent's attack.|$|E
5|$|Married people, however, {{are advised}} not to worship Dhumavati. It {{is said that}} her worship creates a feeling of wanting {{solitude}} and distaste of worldly things, which is considered as highest characteristics of a spiritual quest. Thus, Dhumavati's worship is appropriate for world renouncers who roam as lone wanderers and widows who parallel the life of world renouncers. Dhumavati is also described a being partial <b>to</b> <b>single</b> persons and especially partial to widows. Widows are considered the only beings who can withstand her power.|$|E
5|$|Mass√©na was {{the fourth}} member {{of a group of}} five battleships built to a broadly similar design, but {{different}} enough to be considered unique vessels.

50|$|Another Add-On is Advanced Tape Support, for {{backing up}} <b>to</b> {{multiple}} <b>single</b> tape drives simultaneously or to a dual-tape autoloader. Even the Desktop Edition supports backing up <b>to</b> a <b>single</b> non-autoloader tape drive, but backing up <b>to</b> a <b>single</b> autoloader tape drive requires {{at least the}} Single Server Edition.|$|R

5|$|Miami's defense {{shut out}} one opponent, and held six other opponents <b>to</b> <b>single</b> touchdowns or field goals. Middle guard Jim Burt {{was one of}} the Hurricanes' {{defensive}} leaders, recovering four fumbles in a single game during the regular season. In recognition of this and other performances, Burt was named to the Associated Press All-America list. Also recognized was defensive back Fred Marion, who was named an honorable mention to the All-America list. Marion intercepted seven passes during the regular season, tying him for second in Miami history for the most interceptions in a season.|$|E
5|$|Served by steam {{locomotives}} {{from opening}} {{until the late}} 1950s, passenger services were then taken over by a fleet of diesel-electric multiple units built to the line's loading gauge. Diesel locomotives handled freight, also built to fit the loading gauge. The diesel-electric multiple units served on the line until 1986, when the line was electrified and the most severely affected tunnels were reduced from double track <b>to</b> <b>single.</b>|$|E
5|$|Similar <b>to</b> <b>single</b> interstitials, divacancies do {{not produce}} photoluminescence. Divacancies, in turn, anneal out at ~900¬∞C {{creating}} multivacancy chains detected by EPR and presumably hexavacancy rings. The latter should be invisible to most spectroscopies, and indeed, {{they have not been}} detected thus far. Annealing of vacancies changes diamond color from green to yellow-brown. Similar mechanism (vacancy aggregation) is also believed to cause brown color of plastically deformed natural diamonds.|$|E
