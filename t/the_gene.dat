5|$|Another {{issue is}} the role of {{inherited}} genetic factors in shaping attachments: for example one type of polymorphism of <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> coding for the D2 dopamine receptor has been linked to anxious attachment and another in <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor with avoidant attachment. This suggests that the influence of maternal care on attachment security is not the same for all children. One theoretical basis for this is that it makes biological sense for children to vary in their susceptibility to rearing influence.|$|E
5|$|Huntington's {{disease has}} {{autosomal}} dominant inheritance, meaning that an affected individual typically inherits one copy of <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> with an expanded trinucleotide repeat (the mutant allele) from an affected parent. Since penetrance of the mutation is very high, {{those who have}} a mutated copy of <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> will have the disease. In this type of inheritance pattern, each offspring of an affected individual has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutant allele and therefore being affected with the disorder (see figure). This probability is sex-independent.|$|E

5|$|All {{humans have}} {{two copies of}} the Huntingtin gene (HTT), which codes for the protein Huntingtin (HTT). <b>The</b> <b>gene</b> is also called HD and IT15, which stands for 'interesting {{transcript}} 15'. Part of this gene is a repeated section called a trinucleotide repeat, which varies in length between individuals and may change length between generations. If the repeat is present in a healthy gene, a dynamic mutation may increase the repeat count and result in a defective gene. When the length of this repeated section reaches a certain threshold, it produces an altered form of the protein, called mutant Huntingtin protein (mHTT). The differing functions of these proteins are the cause of pathological changes which in turn cause the disease symptoms. The Huntington's disease mutation is genetically dominant and almost fully penetrant: mutation of either of a person's HTT alleles causes the disease. It is not inherited according to sex, but {{the length of the}} repeated section of <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> and hence its severity can be influenced by the sex of the affected parent.|$|E
