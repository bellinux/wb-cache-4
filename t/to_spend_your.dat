500|$|Throughout 1941 and 1942 Gielgud worked continually, in Barrie's Dear Brutus, another Importance of Being Earnest in the West End, and Macbeth on tour. Returning, {{with more}} {{assurance}} than before, to entertaining the troops, he so far departed from his classical style as to join Lillie and Michael Wilding singing a comic trio. His 1943 revival of William Congreve's Love for Love on tour {{and then in}} London received high praise from reviewers. In 1944 he was approached by Ralph Richardson, who had been asked by the governors of the Old Vic {{to form a new}} company. Unwilling to take sole charge, Richardson proposed a managing triumvirate of Gielgud, Olivier and himself. Gielgud declined: [...] "It would be a disaster, you would have <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>your</b> whole time as referee between Larry and me." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout the war Tyrone Guthrie had striven to {{keep the}} Old Vic company going, even after German bombing in 1942 left the theatre a near-ruin. A small troupe toured the provinces, with Sybil Thorndike at its head. By 1944, with the tide of the war turning, Guthrie felt it time to re-establish the company in a London base and invited Richardson to head it. Richardson made it a {{condition}} of accepting that he should share the acting and management in a triumvirate. Initially he proposed Gielgud and Olivier as his colleagues, but the former declined, saying, [...] "It would be a disaster, you would have <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>your</b> whole time as referee between Larry and me." [...] It was finally agreed that the third member would be the stage director John Burrell. The Old Vic governors approached the Royal Navy to secure the release of Richardson and Olivier; the Sea Lords consented, with, as Olivier put it, [...] "a speediness and lack of reluctance which was positively hurtful." ...|$|E

A small troupe toured the provinces, with Sybil Thorndike at its head. By 1944, with the tide of the war turning, Guthrie felt it time to re-establish the company in a London base, and invited Richardson to head it. Richardson made two stipulations: first, as he was unwilling to seek his own release from the forces, the {{governing}} board of the Old Vic should explain to the authorities why it should be granted; secondly, that he should share the acting and management in a triumvirate.

500|$|B in the Mix: The Remixes {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Kurt Kirton of About.com highlighted the remixes of [...] "Everytime" [...] and [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know", {{adding that the}} album {{would be better if}} it included more tracks. He summarized his review saying, [...] "this is a decent release that should please any Britney fan and most club music fanatics". Barry Walters of Rolling Stone said the album was [...] "even more redundant" [...] than Greatest Hits: My Prerogative, but added that with the exception of [...] "Toxic", [...] "just about every original track is bettered here". Spence D. of IGN said: [...] "If you had the choice to purchase only one Britney Spears' album, then this would be the one <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>your</b> money on." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented that [...] "B in the Mix doesn't exactly erase the impression that Spears isn't in tune with her recording career". He also stated that on tracks such as [...] "Toxic", [...] "her flaws stand out just a bit too much [...] the instrumental hooks have been removed from the record, leaving Spears to carry the day—which she can't really do. [...] Overall this album sounds and feels like what it really is: a piece of product." [...] MTV writer Bradley Stern praised the album, saying it [...] "featured loads of excellent remixes stretching from [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] to [...] "Toxic", but nothing shined quite as bright as the album's undeniable highlight: [...] "And Then We Kiss" [...] (Junkie XL Remix)." ...|$|E
