5|$|Digital Dimension {{worked on}} 200 visual effects {{shots in the}} film, {{including}} the sequence that shows characters John McClane and Matt Farrell crouching between two cars as another car lands {{on top of the}} other cars. To achieve this effect, a crane yanked the car and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air onto the two cars that were also being pulled by cables. The shot was completed when the two characters were integrated into the footage of the car stunt after the lighting was adjusted and CGI glass and debris were added. In the same sequence, John McClane destroys a helicopter that several of Gabriel's henchman are riding in by ramming it with a car. This was accomplished by first filming one take where one of Gabriel's henchman, Rand, jumps from the helicopter, and in the next take the car is propelled into the stationary helicopter as it is hoisted by wires. The final view of the shot overlays the two takes, with added CGI for the debris and moving rotor blades. The company also assisted in adding cars for traffic collisions and masses of people for evacuations from several government buildings.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, once Hitler {{had become}} Chancellor, Rosenberg was named {{leader of the}} Nazi Party's foreign political office, but he played little practical part in the role. Another event of 1933 was Rosenberg's visit to Britain, intended {{to give the impression}} that the Nazis would not be a threat and to encourage links between the new regime and the British Empire. It was a notable failure. When Rosenberg laid a wreath bearing a swastika at the Cenotaph, a Labour Party candidate slashed it and later <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Thames and was fined 40 shillings for willful damage at Bow Street magistrate’s court. In January 1934 Hitler granted Rosenberg responsibility for the spiritual and philosophical education of the Party and all related organizations.|$|E
25|$|Zindler made {{local and}} {{national}} headlines when he and reporter Larry Conners closed the Chicken Ranch in Fayette County, Texas, near La Grange, after he reported on it in 1973. The Chicken Ranch story was featured in a 1973 edition of Texas Monthly magazine, two 1974 issues of Playboy magazine, {{was the basis for}} the Broadway and film musical The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, and served as the basis of the song La Grange by ZZ Top. The closing did not go well with the sheriff of Fayette County, Jim T. Flournoy, who later attacked Zindler in a fight that left Zindler with two fractured ribs, along with a snatched toupee. Reportedly, Flournoy waved the hairpiece in the air {{as if it were a}} prized enemy scalp and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> street.|$|E
50|$|Albers {{is mainly}} a sinkerball pitcher, <b>throwing</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 93-96 mph range. He {{complements}} the sinker {{with a hard}} slider and an occasional curveball.|$|R
50|$|Also, {{during the}} Moghul invasion, <b>the</b> villagers, <b>in</b> {{a measure to}} save such {{beautiful}} doors, said to have hidden these doors, by <b>throwing</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> village pond.|$|R

25|$|Lin also seriously {{attempted}} {{to withdraw from}} the nomination, but was not able to do so because Mao had made Lin's appointment a decision of the Central Committee, so rejecting the position would violate Party procedure and would risk ending Lin's political career. Lin was not present at the conference where it was decided to name him vice chairman. After Lin was named, he met with Mao and begged him personally not to name him to the position, but Mao criticized him, comparing Lin to the Ming emperor Shizong, who devoted so much of his time to the search for longevity medicines that he neglected his government responsibilities. In 1966 all other candidates for the position were removed, and Lin accepted the position as sole Vice-Chairman, replacing Liu Shaoqi as Mao's unofficial successor. After his appointment, Lin again {{attempted to}} submit a formal written request to Mao, asking Mao to rescind Lin's appointment to the position of vice-chairman, but Mao again rejected this request. When Lin received the rejection letter, he was so angry that he tore the letter up and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garbage.|$|E
500|$|Several {{students}} were fined ₤5 by the magistrate, Paul Taylor, at South-West London Police Court in Battersea. This triggered another protest two days later, when 1,000 medical students from UCL, King's, Guy's and the West Middlesex hospitals marched along the Strand toward King's College, waving miniature brown dogs on sticks and a life-sized effigy of the magistrate, and singing, [...] "Let's hang Paul Taylor on a sour apple tree / As we go marching on." [...] The Times {{reported that they}} tried to burn the effigy but, unable to light it, <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Thames instead.|$|E
500|$|The trial resumed on January 16, 2004, {{when the}} Naha court {{accepted}} {{the evidence of}} Brown's spinal and neck injuries. Takaesu testified {{that it would have}} been physically impossible for Brown to commit a violent sexual assault on V. N.. When Takaesu called for the clothing V. N. wore the night of the alleged assault to be entered as evidence, the prosecutor, Tsuyoshi Satake, refused to present it. During a hearing in March, Brown admitted that he had lied to Japanese police about what had happened on the night in question. Brown stated that he and V. N. had engaged in some [...] "heavy petting" [...] in her car and that she objected when he began to take it [...] "too far". After Brown said that he insulted her, she threatened to call the police and he grabbed her cell phone and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river.|$|E
50|$|McKeen is seen {{shooting}} Warrick {{through the}} neck from driver's side window perspective. Then, {{looking at the}} car head on, McKeen fires again. He wipes off <b>the</b> gun and <b>throws</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> passenger seat. Warrick slumps over the steering wheel.|$|R
50|$|During the Second World War, Fr. Lerena rescued {{the icon}} from a junkyard that the Imperial Japanese Army had <b>thrown</b> <b>it</b> <b>in.</b> <b>The</b> image first stayed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Arzobispado (Archbishop's Palace) <b>in</b> Intramuros before <b>it</b> was {{deposited}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vaults of the Philippine National Bank for safekeeping.|$|R
50|$|Johnson's {{recordings}} established him as {{the premier}} Delta blues vocalist of his day, with a powerful voice that could go from a growl to a falsetto. He was an accomplished guitarist. He also performed tricks with his guitar, playing it between his legs and behind his head and <b>throwing</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air while playing.|$|R
500|$|Nirvana first {{played the}} song {{the night before}} it was demoed. Bassist Krist Novoselic {{recalled}} that it [...] "originally sounded like a Bad Brains song. Then Kurt {{turned it into a}} pop song". Cobain went home and reworked the song, playing the revised version of it over the phone to Novoselic. The band recorded [...] "In Bloom" [...] with producer Butch Vig at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin during April 1990. The material recorded at Smart Studios was intended for the group's second album for the independent record label Sub Pop. The song originally had a bridge section that Vig removed. Novoselic said that after the band recorded the song, Vig cut out the bridge from the 16-track master tape with a razor blade and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garbage. The songs from these sessions were placed on a demo tape that circulated amongst the music industry, generating interest in the group among major record labels.|$|E
2500|$|Heracles {{had visited}} Chiron to gain {{advice on how}} to catch the boar, and Chiron had told him to drive it into thick snow, which sets this Labour in mid-winter. [...] Having {{successfully}} caught the Boar, Heracles bound it and carried it back to Eurystheus, who was frightened of it and ducked down in his half-buried storage pithos, begging Heracles {{to get rid of the}} beast, a favourite subject for the vase-painters. Heracles obliged. Roger Lancelyn Green states in his Tales of the Greek Heroes that Heracles <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sea. It then swam to Italy, where its tusks were preserved in the Temple of Apollo at Cumae. Three days later, Eurystheus, still trembling with fear, sent Heracles to clean the Augean stables.|$|E
2500|$|Decisions {{were made}} by voting without any time set aside for deliberation. Nothing, however, stopped jurors from talking informally among {{themselves}} during the voting procedure and juries could be unruly, shouting out their disapproval or disbelief of things said by the litigants. This may have had some role in building a consensus. The voting procedure was public and transparent. Each heliast had received two votes, one [...] "not guilty" [...] and one [...] "guilty". Then the herald (κήρυξ) would, first, ask the heliasts {{if they wanted to}} submit any objections against the witnesses and, then, he would call them to cast their votes in two different amphoras, one of copper for the [...] "non-guilty" [...] votes and one of wood for the [...] "guilty" [...] votes. The voting was secret, since each juror had to cover the vote with his fingers, so that nobody could see in which amphora he <b>threw</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> civil cases the voting procedure was different, because the amphoras were as many as the litigant parties and the jurors had to vindicate one of them by casting their vote.|$|E
5000|$|Jenna and Tracy {{continue}} to fight over the sweatshirt, so they talk to Liz about it, where both are wearing {{one side of the}} sweatshirt. Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) tells them lay off Liz because she is [...] "pregnant". As a result, Liz goes on to get <b>the</b> sweatshirt and <b>throws</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trashcan.|$|R
50|$|Directed by Trey Fanjoy, {{the video}} shows Billy Gilman {{on the bus}} {{home from school and}} watches {{everything}} that goes on around him. At one point <b>in</b> <b>the</b> video, a boy holding a gun (shown earlier <b>in</b> <b>the</b> video) <b>throws</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river below the bridge, is a similar take on the line of the song.|$|R
5000|$|Detroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford {{stars in}} two 15-second spots. In one spot, Stafford finds some stale Chinese food <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{refrigerator}} and <b>throws</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trash {{only for the}} Georgia Bulldogs mascot {{to pull it out}} of <b>the</b> garbage. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> other, the mascot spills water but is being scolded by Stafford, who believes he's used the bathroom on the carpet.|$|R

50|$|At home, Megan wakes Don to {{tell him}} she's been called in to work today, {{and for the rest}} of the week. This will cause her to miss Roger's mother's funeral, which she regrets. When Megan leaves, Don gets out of bed and, again finding Dinkins' lighter, <b>throws</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garbage. Before leaving for the funeral, he starts {{drinking}} while watching TV.|$|R
50|$|Despite her victory, Vanessa is more lonely than ever. She {{offers her}} love to Ethan, but he refuses and turns {{himself into the}} police. Sir Malcolm leaves to escort Sembene's remains back to Africa. Victor descends further into drug addiction. Spiraling into {{depression}} and struggling with the guilt over her own sins, she turns away from God. She takes the cross from her wall, and <b>throws</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fire.|$|R
60|$|Father {{picked up}} the ten-cent tip. With loathing he <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fireplace. Then went, knelt down, and picked it out again. Mother would need all the money he could get {{for her in the}} coming wintry days of failure--failure he himself had brought upon her.|$|E
60|$|It lay, indeed, {{flat and}} {{gleaming in the}} grasses by the well in the wood, {{just as it had}} lain in the thicket where the woodman <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{beginning}} of all these things. But on one corner of the bright blade was a dull brown stain.|$|E
60|$|Lawrence devoted {{that evening}} to his letter. It {{was a long}} one, and was written with a most earnest desire to embrace all the merits {{of each of the}} two kinds of letters, which have before been alluded to, and to avoid all their faults. When it was finished, he read it, tore it up, and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fire.|$|E
5000|$|As regards a ‘true’ {{interpretation}} a {{good starting}} point is Martin Esslin’s comment that the play is “about the artistic process” itself which Beckett by no means found easy; his output is respectable but he was not exactly prolific. “There are two moments worthwhile in writing,” he summed up to a friend, “the one where you start and the other where you <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> waste-paper basket.” ...|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Eric Welch. It starts out with Rodney Atkins's car tearing up, and he winds up walking {{on the road with}} a string of bad luck throughout the video, like losing his luggage when he <b>throws</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> back of someone's car which winds up taking off on him. The video features Atkins's band and Atkins singing the song under an old gas station sign.|$|R
50|$|While {{trying to}} write a report on what happened, the two sane workers are despairing of anyone believing them. Then, bombs fall from the sky, {{blasting}} the whole area below them, including the places the killdozer damaged and the graves of their fellow workers. One worker tears up the report he was writing and <b>throws</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air, thrilled that an explanation is now available -- enemy action in wartime.|$|R
60|$|Somebody untied {{the painter}} and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in.</b> <b>The</b> current gripped {{the boat and}} whirled it away. The murderer did not bother with the oars, contenting himself with sitting in the stern-sheets and rolling a cigarette. Completing it, he struck a match and lighted up. Those that watched on the bank could see the tiny puffs of smoke. They {{remained}} on the bank till the boat swung out of sight around the bend half a mile below. Justice had been done.|$|E
60|$|The shrill snort {{of a horse}} sounded near at hand. With a shock Ellen's body stiffened. Then she quivered {{a little}} and her {{feelings}} underwent swift change. Cautiously and noiselessly she raised herself upon her elbows and peeped through the opening in the brush. She saw a man tying a horse to a bush somewhat back from the Rim. Drawing a rifle from its saddle sheath he <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hollow of his arm {{and walked to the}} edge of the precipice. He gazed away across the Basin and appeared lost in contemplation or thought. Then he turned to look back into the forest, as if he expected some one.|$|E
6000|$|The Bailie next {{produced}} the original bond for the debt, {{on the back}} of which he had written a formal discharge, which, having subscribed himself, he requested me to sign as a witness. I did so, and Bailie Jarvie was looking anxiously around for another, the Scottish law requiring the subscription of two witnesses to validate either a bond or acquittance. [...] "You will hardly find a man that can write save ourselves within these three miles," [...] said Rob, [...] "but I'll settle the matter as easily;" [...] and, taking the paper from before his kinsman, he <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fire. Bailie Jarvie stared in his turn, but his kinsman continued, [...] "That's a Hieland settlement of accounts. The time might come, cousin, were I to keep a' these charges and discharges, that friends might be brought into trouble for having dealt with me." ...|$|E

2500|$|A story [...] from Amsterdam, 1345, {{claims that}} a priest {{was called to}} {{administer}} Viaticum to a dying man. He told the family that if the man threw up, they were to take <b>the</b> contents and <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fire. The man threw up, and the family did what the priest had advised them to do. The next morning, {{one of the women}} went to rake the fire and noticed the Host sitting on the grate, unscathed and surrounded by a light. It has apparently passed through both the man's digestive system and the fire unscathed. [...] The story is commemorated with an annual silent procession through central Amsterdam.|$|R
