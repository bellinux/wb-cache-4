He was then active in using the troops and his naval forces to capture the islands of Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and Grenada, before returning to England. He was made second in command at the Cape of Good Hope in 1797, succeeding to commander-in-chief the following year, and he died while in command there in November 1798.|$|E

5|$|Ballard was {{selected}} in the first round, 11th overall, by the Buffalo Sabres in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft. The choice {{was seen as a}} surprise by draft observers, as he was projected to be a late first-round to second-round pick. Ballard himself professed the early selection to be unexpected, saying he was ready to be drafted between the 20th and 40th positions. Scouting reports listed him as a puck-rushing offensive defenseman with comparisons to Phil Housley. Before making his NHL debut, he was traded <b>twice.</b> <b>He</b> was initially dealt by Buffalo to the Colorado Avalanche on July 3, 2003, for Steven Reinprecht. The following year, he was traded again to the Phoenix Coyotes, along with defenseman Derek Morris, for forward Chris Gratton, defenseman Ossi Väänänen and a second-round selection in the 2005 draft.|$|E
5|$|Besides Lindsay, {{six players}} have scored {{more than three}} tries in a Championship match; of these Ian Smith is the only player to achieve the feat <b>twice.</b> <b>He</b> scored four tries in {{successive}} matches during the 1925 Five Nations Championship. Wales' Jehoida Hodges normally played as a forward, but after an injury to winger Tom Pearson during a match against England, Hodges {{was moved to the}} wing. Despite playing out of position, he scored a hat-trick in a 21–5 victory for Wales. As of 2017, the only forwards to score a Championship hat-trick while actually playing in the forwards are Michel Crauste; he scored three tries for France in their 13–0 victory over England in 1962 and CJ Stander; he scored three tries for Ireland in a 63–10 win over Italy in 2017.|$|E
5|$|By then, Exton had in turn {{been elected}} Mayor. Although {{for a while}} he and Brembre worked {{together}} in running London, when his predecessor fell from influence, Exton effectively deserted him, {{even to the point of}} being partially responsible for Brembre's eventual hanging. Exton's primary policy throughout his two periods as Mayor was probably based on a desire to maintain the city's neutrality between the feuding parties. On the other hand, he appears to have personally profited from the Appellants' period of rule, and it seems that there was some dissatisfaction with him in London, even if he was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing by parliament. His later years are as obscure as his youth; known to have married at least <b>twice,</b> <b>he</b> seems to have had no children, and died in 1402 at an unknown age.|$|E

5|$|Four {{years after}} the election, Goldwater {{returned}} to the Senate and was re-elected <b>twice.</b> <b>He</b> became an influential member of the party's conservative wing, serving {{as chairman of the}} Select Committee on Intelligence and the Committee on Armed Services. He supported the presidential candidacy and eventual presidency of Richard Nixon; however, he was critical of Nixon's attempt to control prices and wages. Initially, Goldwater defended Nixon in light of the Watergate scandal until August 5, 1974, when he withdrew his support. Nixon resigned from office four days later.|$|E

In the off-season he signed a three-year, $26 million deal, securing the highest goaltender salary contract at that time.|$|E
5|$|Nichols stood trial <b>twice.</b> <b>He</b> {{was first}} tried {{by the federal}} {{government}} in 1997 and found guilty of conspiring to build {{a weapon of mass destruction}} and of eight counts of involuntary manslaughter of federal officers. After he was sentenced on June 4, 1998 to life without parole, the State of Oklahoma in 2000 sought a death-penalty conviction on 161counts of first-degree murder (160non-federal agent victims and onefetus). On May 26, 2004 the jury found him guilty on all charges, but deadlocked on the issue of sentencing him to death. Presiding Judge Steven W. Taylor then determined the sentence of 161consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole. In March 2005, FBI investigators, acting on a tip, searched a buried crawl space in Nichols' former house and found additional explosives missed in the preliminary search after Nichols was arrested.|$|E
