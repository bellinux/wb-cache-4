5|$|More global {{behavioural}} abnormalities may be noted, {{such as an}} increase in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor agitation or hyperactivity) which might reflect mania or delirium. An inability <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>still</b> might represent akathisia, {{a side effect of}} antipsychotic medication. Similarly, a global decrease in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor retardation, akinesia or stupor) might indicate depression or a medical condition such as Parkinson's disease, dementia or delirium. The examiner would also comment on eye movements (repeatedly glancing to one side can suggest that the patient is experiencing hallucinations), and the quality of eye contact (which can provide clues to the patient's emotional state). Lack of eye contact may suggest depression or autism.|$|E
5|$|The {{green and}} golden bell frog has been {{detected}} {{in a wide}} range of habitats. It is generally associated with coastal swamps, wetlands, marshes, dams, ditches, small rivers, woodlands, and forests, but populations have also been found at former industrial sites (for instance, the Brickpit). It has even been found in human vessels such as bathtubs. The requirements of its habitat have been difficult to determine, for it has been found {{in a wide range}} of water bodies except fast-flowing streams. It is most typically found in short-lived freshwater ponds that are still, shallow, unshaded, and unpolluted, and it tends to avoid waters that contain predatory fish, whether native or introduced. However, it is most often found in areas that have been affected by human habitation. The frog prefers water bodies that support emergent vegetation, such as reeds and bullrushes, for basking, and winter habitats consist of available shelters around the breeding site, which can be vegetation, rocks, rubbish, or human debris and discarded building materials. Grassy habitats are usually close at hand to provide suitable terrestrial feeding grounds. It prefers waterways with a substrate of sand, rock, or clay, and can tolerate a wide range of water turbidities, pH and oxygen levels, and temperatures, although these can hamper physical growth. Although its legs provide much grip, the frog does not choose to climb trees or live up them to any significant extent. It spends most of its time within 10cm of the ground and rarely ventures more than a metre above the ground. The green and golden bell frog also has the ability <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>still</b> for several minutes.|$|E
25|$|Major Hanham is a little, nervous man, {{who hates}} <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>still.</b> He won his title {{during the war}} of the rebellion.

25|$|Slave {{characters}} in general {{came to be}} low-comedy types with names that matched the instruments they played: Brudder Tambo (or simply Tambo) for the tambourine and Brudder Bones (or Bones) for the bone castanets or bones. These endmen (for {{their position in the}} minstrel semicircle) were ignorant and poorly spoken, being conned, electrocuted, or run over in various sketches. They happily shared their stupidity; one slave character said that to get to China, one had only to go up in a balloon and wait for the world to rotate below. Highly musical and unable <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>still,</b> they constantly contorted their bodies wildly while singing.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} mostly well {{received}} by critics. Blogcritics reviewer Aaraon Peck applauded the Perry and Doofenshmirtz B-Plot, considering it {{as both the}} official Pret episode and {{an example of the}} series' ability to allow [...] "adults [...] enjoy the humor" [...] and not strictly focusing on the entertainment of younger viewers. Conversely, Ed Liu of Toon Zone was critical of the episode and other early episodes available on The Fast and the Phineas, calling them [...] "way too manic for their own good, never giving a gag enough time to develop a proper laugh before ripping off to the next one, and refusing <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>still</b> for any length of time." [...] The production staff reacted positively to the episode, and said that they [...] "really liked" [...] its outcome.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 June 1966, Lamb {{appeared}} without legal counsel at Essex County Magistrate's Court in Windsor, where he was remanded for psychiatric examination. As he was being escorted from the courthouse at around noon, the boy attempted to escape custody and, when restrained, begged the officers to shoot him. A private psychiatrist from Windsor, Walter Yaworsky, gauged the teenager's mental state in an interview starting at 12:30. Yaworsky said that Lamb was [...] "hyperactive and agitated"; he was unable <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>still</b> and periodically rose from his seat and paced around the room. He {{was silent for a}} few minutes, apparently irritated, then began laughing as if in a state of euphoria. When questioned by Yaworsky directly, Lamb did not appear concerned about the interview: he treated his murder charge lightly and when asked about his spell in Kingston Penitentiary began laughing.|$|E

2500|$|Michael Peter Balzary {{was born}} on 16 October 1962 in the Melbourne suburb of Mount Waverley, Victoria. He is of Hungarian and Irish descent. His father, Mick Balzary, an avid fisherman, often took him fishing. When Flea was seven, {{his family moved to}} Larchmont, New York for his father's career. [...] In 1971, his parents {{divorced}} and his father returned to Australia. Flea and his siblings stayed with their mother Patricia, who soon remarried a jazz musician. He was first called [...] "Flea" [...] as a child for his seeming inability <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>still,</b> and the nickname stuck ever since.|$|E
2500|$|... "Lawn Gnome Beach Party of Terror" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Several critics praised the unique and obscure title; DVD Talk reviewer David Cornelius wrote that it [...] "wins major awesomeness points." [...] Similarly, Jim Thomas of DVD Verdict observed that no [...] "description could possibly do justice" [...] to it. Writing for DVD Town, reviewer James Plath considered the flashback to Doofenshmirtz's youth as a lawn gnome {{an example of}} [...] "the deliciously twisted humor of Povenmire and Marsh." [...] In contrast, however, Ed Liu of Toon Zone was critical of the episode and other early episodes available on The Fast and the Phineas, calling them [...] "way too manic for their own good, never giving a gag enough time to develop a proper laugh before ripping off to the next one, and refusing <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>still</b> {{for any length of}} time." ...|$|E

5000|$|Marisa Brown of AllMusic said, [...] "Bracken makes thoughtful, {{reflective}} music, like Brian Eno, or even fellow anticon labelmates Alias or cLOUDDEAD, {{music that}} refuses <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> entirely <b>still,</b> {{that attempts to}} convey {{the broad range of}} human emotion in the details of its composition, and, in the end, succeeds." ...|$|R
2500|$|Critics of DeLillo {{argue that}} his novels are overly stylized and intellectually shallow. In James Wood's review of Zadie Smith's 2000 novel White Teeth, he {{dismissed}} {{the work of}} authors like Dellilo, Wallace, and Smith as [...] "hysterical realism". Bruce Bawer famously condemned DeLillo's novels insisting they weren't actually novels at all but [...] "tracts, designed to batter us, again and again, with a single idea: that life in America today is boring, benumbing, dehumanized...It's better, DeLillo seems to say in one novel after another, to be a marauding murderous maniac – and therefore a human – than <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>still</b> for America as it is, with its air conditioners, assembly lines, television sets, supermarkets, synthetic fabrics, and credit cards." [...] George Will proclaimed the study of Lee Harvey Oswald in Libra as [...] "sandbox existentialism" [...] and [...] "an act of literary vandalism and bad citizenship." [...] DeLillo responded [...] "I don't take it seriously, but being called a 'bad citizen' is a compliment to a novelist, at least to my mind. That's exactly {{what we ought to}} do. We ought to be bad citizens. We ought to, in the sense that we're writing against what power represents, and often what government represents, and what the corporation dictates, and what consumer consciousness has come to mean. In that sense, if we're bad citizens, we're doing our job." [...] In the same interview DeLillo rejected Will's claim that DeLillo blames America for Lee Harvey Oswald, countering that he instead blamed America for George Will. DeLillo also figured prominently in B. R. Myers's critique of recent American literary fiction, A Reader's Manifesto.|$|E

60|$|The day was cold; the man, who was {{compelled}} <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> almost <b>still</b> in a nipping wind, was soon wet through, but this in some curious way further tended to restore his accustomed optimism and good-humour.
