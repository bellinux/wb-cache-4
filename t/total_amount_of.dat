Based on this concept, the harmoniousness <b>of</b> <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> control <b>of</b> water use was analyzed in terms of the supply and demand of water resources, water resources management, water use benefits, and water-saving level. An evaluation index system of the degree <b>of</b> harmony <b>of</b> <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> control <b>of</b> water use was established, and a method for calculation of the degree <b>of</b> harmony <b>of</b> <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> control <b>of</b> water use was developed based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy comprehensive analysis (FCA) methods. The new evaluation index system was applied to a certain area in Jiangsu Province, China. The degree <b>of</b> harmony <b>of</b> <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> control <b>of</b> water use over this area was calculated for different years. Results indicate that the evaluation index system and calculation method proposed in this study are feasible, and such a harmoniousness analysis can provide scientific references for the strict water resources management system that will be implemented in China in the near future...|$|R

The Serra do Mar, in its longest part {{along the shore}} of the state of Sao Paulo, has, as one of its most distinctive climatologic traits, the influence of orography in the <b>total</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> precipitation. The configuration of obstacle and the action of atmospheric systems are responsible for <b>total</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> precipitation significantly different throughout its profile which, by its own right, presents different relief compartments, such as the Baixada Santista and the humid slopes of the hills and its countryside edge. The analysis of a series {{of precipitation}} events distributed according to intensity and duration shows the influence of orography by promoting <b>total</b> precipitation <b>amounts</b> that are among the highest ones in Brazil, up to areas with <b>total</b> <b>amounts</b> which, once compared to the <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> the humid slopes, prove to be areas with rain shadows. In four events chosen throughout the year of 2005 utilizing five pluviometric posts, it has been analyzed both the hourly evolution and the accumulated precipitation for high and low intensity and also for long and short duration. The selected events show that the intensification of the orography happens, mostly, with association of atmospheric systems and the position of the measuring posts. Therefore, it has been noticed that during short duration events the variation <b>of</b> the <b>total</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> precipitation is significantly inferior to the spatial variation during the long duration events, once that, during short duration events, convective systems are predominant whereas, during long duration events, the predominance is of frontal systems, having been registered much higher <b>total</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> precipitation in the posts which were facing the ocean compared to those which were in the countryside posts...|$|R
