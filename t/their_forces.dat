5|$|Early on 25 September, Harald and Tostig {{departed}} their {{landing place}} at Riccall {{with most of}} <b>their</b> <b>forces,</b> but left a third of <b>their</b> <b>forces</b> behind. They brought only light armour, as they expected to just meet the citizens of York, as they had agreed the day before, at Stamford Bridge to decide on who should manage the town under Harald. Once there Harald saw Godwinson's forces approaching, heavily armed and armoured, and greatly outnumbering Harald's. Although (according to non-saga sources) the English forces were held up at the bridge for some time by a single gigantic Norwegian, allowing Harald and Tostig to regroup into a shield-wall formation, Harald's army was in the end heavily beaten. Harald was struck in the throat by an arrow and killed early in the battle {{in a state of}} berserkergang, having worn no body armour and fought aggressively with both hands around his sword.|$|E
5|$|For four months, negotiators {{shuttled}} between Vienna and Berlin, Dresden and Regensburg, and Zweibrücken, Munich and Mannheim. By {{early spring}} 1778, Austria and Prussia {{faced each other}} with armies several {{times the size of}} <b>their</b> <b>forces</b> during the Seven Years' War, and their confrontation had the potential to explode into another European-wide war.|$|E

5|$|The {{first was}} that the Paris Accord that ended the American {{commitment}} was seriously flawed at the outset, in that it permitted the North Vietnamese to maintain <b>their</b> <b>forces</b> within territorial South Vietnam after {{the signing of the}} agreement, thereby dooming the cease-fire.|$|E
5|$|To {{meet the}} Dutch threat, Oerip {{intended}} to attack while the former colonists were still consolidating <b>their</b> <b>forces,</b> {{a plan that}} was quashed by the government's attempts at diplomacy. He preferred guerrilla tactics to formal military conflicts, once telling a subordinate that the best attack would be one with a hundred snipers hidden behind enemy lines. Oerip was strongly against the Renville Agreement, an ultimately unsuccessful treaty {{that led to the}} withdrawal of 35,000troops from western Java and the formalisation of the Van Mook Line between Dutch and Indonesian forces. He saw the agreement, ratified on 17January 1948, as a stalling tactic, giving the Dutch the chance to strengthen <b>their</b> <b>forces.</b> Meanwhile, Amir Sjarifuddin– by then also serving as prime minister– began culling the army, predominantly keeping leftist-leaning troops. Disgusted with what he perceived as the government's lack of trust in the military, Oerip tendered his resignation, although he continued to serve as an advisor to the Minister of Defence, Vice President Hatta.|$|E

5|$|Venice {{could not}} {{directly}} confront the large Ottoman expeditionary force on Crete, {{but it did}} possess a fine navy, that could intervene and cut the Ottoman supply routes. In 1645, the Venetians and their allies possessed a fleet of 60–70 galleys, 4 galleasses and about 36 galleons. The Venetians were also superior {{in their use of}} a mixed fleet of both galleys and sailing ships, while initially, the Ottoman navy relied almost exclusively on galleys. In order to bolster <b>their</b> <b>forces,</b> both opponents hired armed merchantmen from the Netherlands, and later from England (especially the Ottomans), to augment <b>their</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{hostilities}} resumed, they sacked both Oreus, on {{the northern}} coast of Euboea and Opus, the chief city of eastern Locris. The spoils from Oreus had been reserved for Sulpicius, who returned there, while Attalus stayed to collect the spoils from Opus. With <b>their</b> <b>forces</b> divided, Philip attacked Opus. Attalus, caught by surprise, was barely able to escape to his ships.|$|E
5|$|After {{joining forces}} with {{communist}} guerrillas, one of Peng's first actions was to save Mao, whose forces were being encircled by Kuomintang units: Peng broke the encirclement {{and drove the}} enemy off. Peng then met with Zhu and Mao, and they reorganized <b>their</b> <b>forces</b> and decided to form a base area around the Ruijin, Jiangxi, an agricultural city that was only defended by weak warlord units. Zhu and Mao occupied the area, informally beginning the Jiangxi Soviet in January 1929.|$|E

However, with <b>their</b> <b>forces</b> divided, Philip, alerted by signal fire, attacked and took Opus. Attalus, caught by surprise, was barely able to escape to his ships.|$|E
5|$|Amalric of Jerusalem {{entrusted}} {{the government}} of the Kingdom of Jerusalem to Bohemond before departing for his campaign against Egypt in July 1164. Taking advantage of Bohemond's absence, Nur ad-Din attacked the fortress at Harenc in the Principality of Antioch (present-day Harem, Syria). Bohemond, RaymondIII of Tripoli, ThorosII of Armenian Cilicia, and Constantine Kalamanos joined <b>their</b> <b>forces</b> and marched to Harenc, compelling Nur ad-Din to retreat.|$|E
5|$|At Stockach, the French {{concentrated}} <b>their</b> <b>forces</b> into shorter lines, creating intense fighting conditions; initially, Charles's {{line was}} more extended, {{but he quickly}} pulled additional troops from his reserves to strengthen his front. When a small French force commanded by Dominique Vandamme nearly flanked the Austrian Army, Charles's personal intervention was crucial for the Austrians, buying time for reinforcements to arrive. General Jourdan, while trying to rally his men, was nearly trampled to death. Ultimately, the French were driven back upon the Rhine River.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the need}} to defend against these incursions, the Byzantines could not afford to use all <b>their</b> <b>forces</b> against the Persians. Heraclius sent an envoy to the Avar Khagan, saying that the Byzantines would pay a tribute in return for the Avars to {{withdraw}} north of the Danube. The Khagan replied by asking for a meeting on 5 June 623, at Heraclea in Thrace, where the Avar army was located; Heraclius agreed to this meeting, coming with his royal court. The Khagan, however, put horsemen en route to Heraclea to ambush and capture Heraclius, so they could hold him for ransom.|$|E

5|$|By 1759, Prussia {{had reached}} a {{strategic}} defensive position in the war. Upon leaving winter quarters in April 1759, Frederick assembled his army in Lower Silesia; this forced the main Habsburg army to remain in its winter staging position in Bohemia. The Russians, however, shifted <b>their</b> <b>forces</b> into western Poland and marched westward toward the Oder river, a move that threatened the Prussian heartland, Brandenburg, and potentially Berlin itself. Frederick countered by sending an army corps commanded by Friedrich August von Finck to contain the Russians; he sent a second column commanded by Christoph II von Dohna to support Finck.|$|E

5|$|By {{the start}} of July 1944, Commonwealth forces in Southeast Asia had {{repelled}} the Japanese sieges in Assam, pushing the Japanese back to the Chindwin River while the Chinese captured Myitkyina. In September 1944, Chinese force captured the Mount Song to reopen the Burma Road. In China, the Japanese had more successes, having finally captured Changsha in mid-June {{and the city of}} Hengyang by early August. Soon after, they invaded the province of Guangxi, winning major engagements against Chinese forces at Guilin and Liuzhou by the end of November and successfully linking up <b>their</b> <b>forces</b> in China and Indochina by mid-December.|$|E

Control of the upper Hudson would enable the British to link <b>their</b> <b>forces</b> in Quebec with those in New York, recently captured in the New York campaign by Major General William Howe. This strategy would separate the American colonies of New England from those farther south and potentially quash the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|During the night, {{artillery}} strikes continued, eventually {{forcing the}} ICU frontlines to falter. A mutiny within the ICU caused <b>their</b> <b>forces</b> to disintegrate, and abandon both Jilib and Kismayo. At 10p.m., {{the sounds of}} battle died down. By midnight, the ICU front in Jilib had collapsed, and the ICU began to flee. By 2:00a.m., they had fled from Kismayo. Local militiamen patrolled the streets, and looting began of former ICU property. They were reported to be fleeing towards Ras Kamboni island in southern Somalia, or the Kenyan border.|$|E
