5|$|Being like Lofty was {{something}} I aspired to without realising it. When I joined the Regiment I {{was told that}} the best way to survive those first years in the Sabre squadron was to pick out someone who you thought you would like to be. Shut up, watch and listen. For me there were a number of the 'old and bold' who fitted that requirement. It wasn't until later in my service <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> that most of them, as newly 'badged' members to a squadron, had picked Lofty.|$|E
25|$|When I grew {{up there}} weren't many other guitarists... There was one other guitarist {{in my school}} who {{actually}} showed me the first chords <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> and I went on from there. I was bored so I taught myself the guitar from listening to records. So obviously {{it was a very}} personal thing.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, Callas told Lord Harewood, De Hildalgo had {{the real}} great {{training}}, {{maybe even the}} last real training of the real bel canto. As a young girl—thirteen years old—I was immediately thrown into her arms, meaning <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> the secrets, the ways of this bel canto, which of course as you well know, is not just beautiful singing. It is a very hard training; it {{is a sort of}} a strait-jacket that you're supposed to put on, {{whether you like it or}} not. You have to learn to read, to write, to form your sentences, how far you can go, fall, hurt yourself, put yourself back on your feet continuously. De Hidalgo had one method, which was the real bel canto way, where no matter how heavy a voice, it should always be kept light, it should always be worked on in a flexible way, never to weigh it down. It is a method of keeping the voice light and flexible and pushing the instrument into a certain zone where it might not be too large in sound, but penetrating. And teaching the scales, trills, all the bel canto embellishments, which is a whole vast language of its own.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{took place}} {{throughout}} September 2004 in Vancouver, British Columbia. Before filming, ABC {{announced that the}} production would adapt elements from the original 1900 book, rather than the 1939 film. such as the Silver Shoes instead of the Ruby slippers. [...] On August 25, 2004, {{it was announced that}} Hilary Duff, Jessica Simpson, and Ashanti had auditioned for the role of Dorothy Gale, but Ashanti had won the part. When asked about how she felt about working with the Muppets, Ashanti replied, [...] "I love children, and to me, the Muppets are just like little kids." [...] She also stated, [...] "The director had to give me a few pointers and tips for acting with them, {{but the most important thing}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> was to keep eye contact." [...] Also in August 2004, BBC News reported that Quentin Tarantino would appear in the film.|$|E
500|$|Chaplin {{believed}} his first influence {{to be his}} mother, who entertained him as a child by sitting {{at the window and}} mimicking passers-by: [...] "it was through watching her <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> not only how to express emotions with my hands and face, but also how to observe and study people." [...] Chaplin's early years in music hall allowed him to see stage comedians at work; he also attended the Christmas pantomimes at Drury Lane, where he studied the art of clowning through performers like Dan Leno. [...] Chaplin's years with the Fred Karno company had a formative effect on him as an actor and filmmaker. Simon Louvish writes that the company was his [...] "training ground", and it was here that Chaplin learned to vary the pace of his comedy. The concept of mixing pathos with slapstick was learnt from Karno, who also used elements of absurdity that became familiar in Chaplin's gags. From the film industry, Chaplin drew upon the work of the French comedian Max Linder, whose films he greatly admired. In developing the Tramp costume and persona, he was likely inspired by the American vaudeville scene, where tramp characters were common.|$|E
500|$|Jagger and Richards {{shared an}} admiration of Jimmy Reed, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, and Little Walter, which {{influenced}} Brian Jones, of whom Richards says, [...] "He was more into T-Bone Walker and jazz blues stuff. We'd turn him onto Chuck Berry and say, 'Look, it's {{all the same}} shit, man, {{and you can do}} it.'" [...] Charlie Watts, a traditional jazz drummer, [...] was also introduced to the blues through his association with the pair. [...] "Keith and Brian turned me on to Jimmy Reed and people like <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> that Earl Phillips was playing on those records like a jazz drummer, playing swing, with a straight four." [...] Jagger, recalling when he first heard the likes of Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters, Fats Domino, and other major American R artists, said it [...] "seemed the most real thing" [...] he had heard up to that point. Similarly, Keith Richards, describing the first time he listened to Muddy Waters, said it was the [...] "most powerful music [...] ever heard... the most expressive." [...] He also stated, [...] "when you think of some dopey, spotty seventeen year old from Dartford, who wants to be Muddy Waters—and {{there were a lot of}} us—in a way, very pathetic, but in another way, very... heartwarming".|$|E

5000|$|When {{he began}} his writing, Indian authors were unknown. [...] "Kind of growing up around the reservations, I just kept my eyes open and my ears open, listened {{to a lot of}} stories. You might say my senses were really brought alive by <b>that</b> culture. <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> more about it than I knew I did. It was only after I began writing about it <b>that</b> <b>I</b> realize <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had <b>learned.</b> <b>I</b> knew quite a bit, in certain ways, about the Blackfeet and Gros Ventre ways of life."

500|$|Capitol Records {{executives}} {{were worried that}} the lyrics contained psychedelic overtones, and Brian was accused of having based the song's production on his LSD experiences. Brian clarified that the song was written {{under the influence of}} marijuana, not LSD. He explained: [...] "I made ‘Good Vibrations’ on drugs; I used drugs to make <b>that.</b> ... <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> how to function behind drugs, and it improved my brain ... it made me more rooted in my sanity." [...] In Steven Gaines's 1986 biography, Wilson is quoted on the lyrics: [...] "We talked about good vibrations with the song and the idea, and we decided on one hand that you could say ... those are sensual things. And then you'd say, 'I'm picking up good vibrations,' which is a contrast against the sensual, the extrasensory perception that we have. That's what we're really talking about." [...] Brian claimed in 2012 that the song's [...] "gotta keep those good vibrations" [...] bridge was inspired by Stephen Foster. Al Jardine of the Beach Boys compared the section to Foster's [...] "Down by the Riverside". According to Love, the lyric [...] "'she goes with me to a blossom world' was originally meant to be followed by the words 'we find'", but Brian elected to cut off the line to highlight the bass track linking into the chorus.|$|E

The truth of the world is that it is chaotic. The truth is, {{that it is not the}} Jewish banking conspiracy, or the grey aliens, or the twelve-foot reptiloids from another dimension that are in control, the truth is far more frightening; no-one is in control, the world is rudderless." ...|$|E
