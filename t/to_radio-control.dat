5|$|In 1935–1937, {{the ship}} was {{converted}} <b>to</b> <b>radio-control</b> which allowed her to be maneuvered by operators aboard another ship and additional armor was added. At {{the beginning of the}} Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, she transported a battalion of naval troops to the Shanghai area. Settsu simulated the radio traffic of eight aircraft carriers {{at the beginning of the}} Pacific War in an effort to deceive Allied intelligence as to the locations and activities of the Japanese carriers. For the rest of the war she served as a target for carrier pilots. Settsu was badly damaged when Allied carrier aircraft attacked the IJN base at Kure in July 1945 and was forced to beach herself lest she sink. The ship was stricken from the Navy List on 20 November and her hulk was raised and broken up in 1946–1947.|$|E
500|$|Between October 1935 and 1937, Settsu was {{converted}} <b>to</b> <b>radio-control</b> which {{allowed her to}} be maneuvered by operators aboard the destroyer [...] Armor on the deck, funnels, and bridge was added to strengthen her ability to survive hits.|$|E
5000|$|The British pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} [...] {{was converted}} <b>to</b> <b>radio-control</b> in 1920-21 {{and used for}} assessments of the damage that could be caused by aircraft and various calibres of guns. She was replaced in the role by the battleship [...] in 1926.|$|E
50|$|Distributed {{power was}} {{originally}} {{able to be}} provided at only one intermediate location within a train. These forerunner systems (Locotrol 102-105 and Locotrol II) required a radio-relay car to be attached via standard multiple-unit jumper cabling to the remote locomotive(s) <b>to</b> provide the <b>radio-control</b> commands and facilitate feedback signals. Later, Locotrol II evolved into the 'Universal' {{system in which the}} radio-control equipment was installed on the locomotives themselves, rendering the relay car (variously referred-to as an 'RCU' for remote control unit or 'LRC' for locomotive remote control) redundant.|$|R
30|$|In {{regard to}} {{the control of the}} whole device, we decide to adopt a control similar <b>to</b> the <b>radio-control</b> cars, since, like them, our system is {{underactuated}} and a forward motion is generated in order to move sideways. The main difference is that our device can move in three-dimensional space. The x-axis from the joystick represents the horizontal motion, meaning left-right motion, and the y-axis represent the vertical motion, meaning the up-down motion. This two motions are defined on a local reference frame that is located {{at the tip of the}} probe, which moves all the time with the probe and keeps its y-axis perpendicular to the ground of the user: the inertial reference frame. Finally, the z-axis of the joystick controls the magnitude of the thrust force. As a result, through the attitude obtained via the IMU, the flow of the pumps is adapted automatically to any orientation that the probe has, in order to fulfill the motion in the wanted direction. We also chose this strategy of control because up to this point in the design, there is no camera installed on the probe and the operator needs to keep sight of the position of the probe. Later, when a camera is installed at the tip of the probe, this control can be modified in order to define all the motions completely with respect to the local reference system located at the tip of the probe.|$|R
40|$|This final {{project is}} to {{implement}} and verify some of the subsystems {{that make up the}} Lunar mission designed by the team FREDNET Team (www. teamfrednet. org) for the Google Lunar X Prize, a competition to land on the moon in 20 XX, collaborating on the design of some components. This project is developed in collaboration with other researchers of many nationalities and therefore needs {{to be part of the}} group in a real project focused on the use of open source software and the Internet community. Especially important is the development of, with our collaboration, one of the possible Rovers (vehicle that will move through the lunar surface) under the name of Pico-Rover. Highlights its particular design, emulating a small ball. We can develop a new concept of proposing Rovers miniaturization and cost reduction by applying concepts of physics but unconventional or usual (by now, all are Rovers used have low manoeuvrability and very high cost). Especially, we have studied and developed a short-range communication to allow the sending and receiving data to the Rover as images, video, telemetry, etc, and accelerometers <b>to</b> achieve <b>radio-control</b> and autonomous Rover control. Furthermore, we proceed to the study, construction and testing of communications boards CAN-Do for possible use in the Lunar Bus and / or Lunar Lander, which will commented in detail later. It has also initiated an investigation to give the Rover a system for detecting obstacles under the name of PicoSAR (micro-RADAR). It has also studied possible characteristics of a satellite link between the Rover and the Lunar Lander, which allows you to be in contact with the Rover. It is a very ambitious project, but which also allows us to participate in an innovative and very interesting format that we can already say that we are an important part in the team...|$|R

In late August 1937, Settsu, {{under the command of}} Captain Naomasa Sakonju, transported a battalion of the Sasebo 4th Special Naval Landing Force to the Shanghai area {{in the early stages of}} the Second Sino-Japanese War. The troops were transferred offshore to the light cruiser [...] and the Yakaze for transportation up the Yangtze River. During 1940, the ship was modified to make it suitable to train carrier pilots, and was used extensively by bomber pilots practicing for the attack on Pearl Harbor. She participated in the fleet review by Emperor Hirohito on 11 October 1940 in Tokyo Bay.|$|E
5|$|On 7 April, Utah left Norfolk for {{sea trials}} to train her engine room crew and <b>to</b> test the <b>radio-control</b> equipment. The ship could be {{controlled}} at varying rates of speed and changes of course: maneuvers that a ship would conduct in battle. Her electric motors, operated by signals from the controlling ship, opened and closed throttle valves, moved her steering gear, and regulated the supply of oil to her boilers. In addition, a Sperry gyro pilot kept the ship on course. She passed her radio control trials on 6 May, and on 1 June, the ship was operated for 3 hours under radio control. On 9 June, she again left Norfolk, bound for San Pedro, California, where she joined Training Squadron 1, Base Force, United States Fleet. Starting in late July, the ship began her first round of target duty, first for the cruisers of the Pacific Fleet, and then for the battleship Nevada. She continued in this role for the next nine years; she participated in Fleet Problem XVI in May 1935, during which she served as a transport for a contingent of Marines. In June, the ship was modified to train anti-aircraft gunners {{in addition to her}} target ship duties. To perform this task, she was equipped with a new /75 caliber anti-aircraft gun in a quadruple mount for experimental testing and development of the new type of weapon.|$|R
