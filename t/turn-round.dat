5000|$|The European Union (EU), in {{its fourth}} update {{of the list}} of blacklisted {{airlines}} released in , banned TAAG aircraft from entering into European airspace because of safety concerns. At the same time, the United Kingdom barred TAAG from flying into its territory, just before the airline was about to start services to London-Gatwick; in retaliation, Angola banned British Airways from landing in Angola. The carrier announced it was losing [...] million a month owing to the ban. To continue operating flights to Europe, TAAG wet-leased a Boeing 747-400 from South African Airways (SAA). [...] Following the EU ban, in November 2008 the entire TAAG board was replaced and a new board was appointed with the objective of turning the carrier round, and in particular getting it removed from the EU blacklist.

50|$|Economic {{liberalization}} of 1991 followed by Information Technology industry explosion have taken India {{to a new}} growth scenario. Backed by strong fundamentals and commendable growth {{in the past three}} to four years, the resplendent Indian Economy is poised to grow even further at an average of 8 to 10% in the next 3 years. Transport requirement in the country, being primarily a derived demand, is slated to increase with elasticity of 1.25 with GDP growth by 10 to 12% in the medium and long term range. Riding on the waves of economic success, Indian Railways has witnessed a dramatic turn around and unprecedented financial turnover in the last two and a half years. This has been made possible by higher freight volumes without substantial investment in infrastructure, increased axle load, reduction of <b>turn-round</b> time of rolling stock, reduced unit cost of transportation, rationalization of tariffs resulting in improvement in market share and improved operational margins. Over the last 2 to 3 years, the railway freight traffic has grown by 8 to 11%, which is projected to cross 1100 million tonnes by the end of 11th Five Year Plan.|$|E
50|$|In 1948 the LMS was nationalised as British Railways, London Midland Region. Nationalisation greatly {{facilitated}} the modernisation of British Railways and, after a false start developing new improved steam engines, electrification came, along with diesel power and fixed-formation air-braked trains. These changes {{had a significant}} effect on Crewe station. Notably, the variation in station use caused firstly by the electrification in stages of the West Coast Main Line between 1959 and 1974 and secondly by the general end of steam traction on Britain's railways. Following the completion of electrification in 1974, trains did not need to change locomotives at Crewe, except for the London to Chester and Holyhead service. Many locomotive hauled trains were replaced by electric or diesel multiple unit trains, with much faster <b>turn-round</b> times. Additionally, two local branch lines had closed, which resulted in fewer trains terminating at Crewe. However, compensating for the decline of local passenger traffic, the reduction in mail and parcels traffic and the total elimination of livestock carriage, came the great increase in inter-city passenger traffic and the need for even faster, smoother and more efficient handling of passenger trains.|$|E

But the next day, Luftflotte 6 had to dispatch all its aircraft to cover a new offensive north of Vitebsk. Nowotny scored his 255th, and last, victory on the Eastern Front. A few minutes later Schnörrer, ever the good wingman, shot down an Il-2 bomber attacking Nowotny for his own 35th victory, before he himself was shot down by another bomber. Baling out at only about 50m his parachute couldn't deploy in time, and he crashed to the ground; alive, but breaking both legs and fracturing his skull.|$|E

40|$|With Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) as {{a generic}} concept of working {{together}} of all airport partners, the main aim of this research project was to increase {{the understanding of the}} Influences on the Target Off-Block Time (TOBT) Prediction Accuracy during A-CDM. Predicting the TOBT accurately is important, because all airport partners use it as a reference time for the departure of the flights after the aircraft <b>turn-round.</b> Understanding such influencing factors is therefore not only required for finding measures to counteract inaccurate TOBT predictions, but also for establishing a more efficient A-CDM <b>turn-round</b> process. The research method chosen comprises a number of steps. Firstly, within the framework of a Cognitive Work Analysis, the sub-processes as well as the information requirements during <b>turn-round</b> were analysed. Secondly, a survey approach aimed at finding and describing situations during <b>turn-round</b> that are critical for TOBT adherence was pursued. The problems identified here were then investigated in field observations at different airlines’ operation control rooms. Based on the findings from these previous steps, small-scale human-in-the-loop experiments were designed aimed at testing hypotheses about data/information availability that influence TOBT predictability. A <b>turn-round</b> monitoring tool was developed for the experiments. As a result of this project, the critical chain of <b>turn-round</b> events and the decisions necessary during all stages of the <b>turn-round</b> were identified. It was concluded that information required but not shared among participants can result in TOBT inaccuracy swings. In addition, TOBT predictability was shown to depend on the location of the TOBT <b>turn-round</b> controller who assigns the TOBT: More reliable TOBT predictions were observed when the <b>turn-round</b> controller was physically present at the aircraft. During the experiments, TOBT prediction could be improved by eight minutes, if available information was cooperatively shared ten minutes prior <b>turn-round</b> start between air crews and <b>turn-round</b> controller; TOBT prediction could be improved by 15 minutes, if additional information was provided by ramp agents five minutes after turnround start.

Handling airborne aircraft is becoming more rationalized as an effect of sophisticated technology and lower separation-minima.

Several change projects at European airports focus on increased airport efficiency gathered under a EUROCONTROL initiative.

The social and psychological aspects of implementing the CDM concept were studied during the pre-implementation phases at a European airport. The purpose was to exploratorily analyse the involved employees’ participation and empowerment preceding the implementation, and how that affected the employees’ attitudes and emotions toward CDM. Fourteen respondents from five airport organisations were interviewed. The results showed low level of participation and empowerment, affecting attitudes and emotions negatively towards the planning, preparation, and development phases preceding the CDM implementation.

In the 'cotton-wheat' system personal characteristics like education, tenancy status, attitude towards risk implied in the use of new technologies and contact with extension agents are the main factors that affect adoption. As regards the 'rice-wheat' system, resource endowments such as farm size, access to a 'no-tillage' drill, clayey soils and the area sown to the rice-wheat sequence along with tenancy and contact with extension agents were dominant in explaining adoption.

Only recently have researchers in construction management begun to look closer at the relationship between contractors and customers.

There is a consensus among service management investigators that services are intangible; other often mentioned characteristics are heterogeneity, perishability, and the inseparability of production and consumption. Except for inseparability these characteristics are valid for refurbishment. Nevertheless, features such as the long <b>turn-round</b> time, the number of participants, the complexity and the uncertainty, distinguish housing refurbishment from most services. There is strong empirical support for the claim that customer satisfaction increases customer loyalty and gives the service producer a positive reputation, ultimately increasing profitability.
