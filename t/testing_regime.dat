5|$|During 2002, the Comanche program {{underwent}} heavy restructuring; consequently, {{the number}} of Comanches that were intended to be purchased was dropped down to 650 rotorcraft. At the time, the projected total cost for the full production of the Comanche in such numbers stood at $26.9 billion. Originally, he EMD phase had been planned to last for six years, as well as having involved {{a total of five}} Comanches being constructed to participate in the <b>testing</b> <b>regime.</b> During 2003, production on the third RAH-66, which was intended to be the first EMD-conformant helicopter, was started. Subsequently, eight RAH-66s were to be constructed for operational testing purposes. As planned, the initial production RAH-66s were to be completed to a Block I configuration, which would have included the majority of the rotorcraft's planned weapons and sensors. From the 16th Comanche onwards, deliveries would have been made to the Block II standard, which was to have all of the planned capabilities included.|$|E

40|$|Evaluation of {{battery and}} other energy storage {{technologies}} for stationary uses is progressing rapidly toward application-specific testing that uses computer-based data acquisition and control equipment, active electronic loads and power supplies, and customized software, to enable sophisticated <b>test</b> <b>regimes</b> that simulate actual use conditions. These simulated-use tests provide more accurate performance and life evaluations than simple constant resistance or current <b>testing</b> <b>regimes.</b> Some {{of the tests}} use stepped constant-power charge and discharge regimes to simulate conditions created by electric utility applications such as frequency regulation and spinning reserve. Other test profiles under development simulate conditions for the energy storage component of Remote Area Power Supplies (RAPS) that include renewable and/or fossil-fueled generators. Various RAPS applications have unique sets of service conditions that require specialized test profiles. However, almost all RAPS tests and many tests that represent other stationary applications need to simulate significant time periods during which storage devices operate at low-to-medium states-of-charge without full recharge. Consideration of these and similar issues in simulated-use <b>test</b> <b>regimes</b> is necessary to effectively predict {{the responses of the}} various types of batteries in specific stationary applications. This paper describes existing and evolving stationary applications for energy storage technologies and <b>test</b> <b>regimes</b> that are designed to simulate them.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} and compare teachers’ attitudes to the current <b>testing</b> <b>regimes</b> for the 14 - 19 age cohorts in England and Sweden. A literature review reveals the historical and political contexts to the prevalent <b>testing</b> <b>regimes</b> in the two countries. One important finding is that the central tests in Sweden have clearly defined objectives whereas the tests’ objectives in England are, at best, insufficiently communicated but at worst not clearly thought through. The study also comprises a questionnaire with the purpose of collecting comparable material of teachers’ attitudes in both countries. Despite the small sample, the results clearly highlight significant discrepancies between objectives and achievements on the one hand and between English and Swedish attitudes on the other. Differences arose between the two countries on how well the objectives of tests are being met. English respondents are more positive towards external marking; meanwhile teaching to the test is seen as a lesser problem in Sweden. Many of these discrepancies and differences in attitudes can be explained from historical and cultural differences to education and assessment systems...|$|R
