5|$|A 15-year-old elephant, Ellie May, had {{acquired}} an undeserved {{reputation for being}} dangerous, which made her extremely difficult to sell. Her food costs became difficult to justify, but Grayson refused to have her put down. Although he left the zoo in January 1978, Grayson returned frequently to care for Ellie May, the last animal left at the zoo. Eventually Rotterdam Zoo agreed to take her, and plans were made to transport the elephant to the Netherlands. Ellie May refused <b>to</b> <b>budge</b> however, and overnight developed pneumonia and heart failure. Grayson and veterinary surgeon, David Taylor, felt {{that she would not}} recover, and decided to call in a marksman to euthanise her.|$|E
5|$|Shakti on {{a narrow}} path. As a kshatriya (member of the ruler class), Kalmashapada does not make way for Shakti, a brahmin (priestly class). Nevertheless, Shakti refuses <b>to</b> <b>budge.</b> Finally, an enraged Kalmashapada hits Shakti with his whip. In turn, the sage curses the king to wander the forest for 16 years. The sage Vishwamitra, the arch-enemy of Vashishtha who desires to have Kalmashapada as his disciple, sends a rakshasa to possess the king's body. Vishwamitra plots to destroy his enemy's family {{with the help of}} the king. Under the {{influence}} of the rakshasa, the king serves human flesh to a Brahmin, who sets Shakti's curse into effect. The king turns into a cannibalistic rakshasa.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{organised}} {{a meeting}} with Johnston, starting at 09:00 on 18 August, where he informed the British High Commissioner that he had considered the Lisbon appointment extensively, {{with the help of}} Dupont, several legal advisers, and a judge of the Rhodesian High Court. The judge had examined the relevant documents, and had {{come to the conclusion that}} Dupont's interpretation of them was correct. Smith therefore felt certain that Reedman's appointment was legitimate so long as Portugal agreed. A long argument ensued, with neither man willing <b>to</b> <b>budge.</b> Smith said that he had always tried to be flexible and civil, but that he and his government felt they had to make a stand. By making clear to Lisbon the exact nature of their proposed representative, and informing Britain of their intent, Smith said the Rhodesians had filled every legal obligation.|$|E
5|$|Culverhouse's {{treatment}} of quarterback Doug Williams caused resentment {{not only on}} the team, but in the entire Bay Area community. Williams led the Buccaneers to the playoffs in three of his five years with the team, and was considered to be their single most important player. However, he was only paid $120,000 a year, which ranked 42nd among NFL quarterbacks, was less than what some teams' third-string quarterbacks made, and was lower than the salary of Terdell Middleton, a running back who had two total carries in his two years in Tampa Bay. After the 1982 season, Williams asked for a $600,000 contract that would pay him among the league's top quarterbacks. Culverhouse refused <b>to</b> <b>budge</b> from his initial offer of $400,000, which he said would make Williams one of the five highest-paid quarterbacks in the league. Williams' agent disputed this, saying that Culverhouse's offer was substantially less than what several other quarterbacks made. With negotiations at a standstill, the Buccaneers traded the following season's first-round draft pick to the Cincinnati Bengals in exchange for Jack Thompson, a backup quarterback who had been unable to unseat Ken Anderson, as an insurance policy should Williams prove impossible to sign, or have trouble recovering from offseason knee surgery. Williams interpreted this as a sign that the team did not want him, and instead signed a contract with the Oklahoma Outlaws of the United States Football League.|$|E
25|$|The conflict, {{for years}} {{localized}} and contained, entered its second phase in early 1888. Skirmishes between newspapers suddenly exploded when {{prestige of the}} claimant got involved; as Nocedal refused <b>to</b> <b>budge,</b> in August Carlos VII expulsed him from Carlism. Now both leaders rushed to acknowledge differences, with unusually brutal frankness listed by the claimant and Ramón Nocedal.|$|E
50|$|According <b>to</b> Riggs, however, <b>Budge</b> {{still had}} a very powerful, very deadly {{overhead}} and rather than winning outright very many points with his lobbing, he actually achieved two other goals: his constant lobbing led <b>Budge</b> <b>to</b> play somewhat deeper at the net {{than he would have}} otherwise, thereby making it easier for Riggs to hit passing shots for winners; and the constant lobbing helped <b>to</b> wear <b>Budge</b> down by forcing him to run back to the backline time after time. Budge reached two more U.S. Pro finals, losing in 1949 at Forest Hills to Riggs and in 1953 in Cleveland to Pancho Gonzales.|$|R
5000|$|After the war, as a professional, Riggs won the US Pro {{titles in}} 1946, 1947, and 1949, beating Don Budge {{in all three}} finals. In the 1946 tour against Budge, Riggs won 24 matches and lost 22, plus 1 match tied at Birmingham, Alabama {{establishing}} himself as {{the best player in}} the world (source : American Lawn Tennis July 15, 1946, page 34). The next year, according to some sources, he beat Budge again by the same narrow margin. But other sources say that he played Budge infrequently and that his primary tour was against Frank Kovacs, whom he beat 11 matches <b>to</b> 10. <b>Budge</b> had sustained an injury to his right shoulder in a military training exercise during the war and had never fully recovered his earlier flexibility. Now, in 1947, according to Kramer, [...] "Bobby played <b>to</b> <b>Budge's</b> shoulder, lobbed him to death, won the first twelve matches, thirteen out of the first fourteen, and then hung on <b>to</b> beat <b>Budge,</b> twenty-four matches <b>to</b> twenty-two." [...] Kramer himself, however, had a sensational 1947 as an amateur and it is debatable whether he or Riggs was actually the top player for the year (both players met three times at the end of December on fast indoor courts, Riggs won two matches).|$|R
50|$|Introduced to tennis at age 12, {{he became}} {{good enough to}} earn invites to play in River Forest, Illinois and in Milwaukee.

The steel companies, realizing that they could wait until Eisenhower forced union members back to work, refused to make any such concessions.|$|E
25|$|Warners had {{approached}} Arthur Penn, Stanley Kubrick, and Mike Nichols, to direct, {{all of whom}} turned the project down. Originally Mark Rydell was hired to direct, but William Peter Blatty insisted on Friedkin instead, because he wanted his film {{to have the same}} energy as Friedkin's previous film, The French Connection. After a standoff with the studio, which initially refused <b>to</b> <b>budge</b> over Rydell, Blatty eventually got his way. Principal photography for The Exorcist began on August 21, 1972. The shooting schedule was estimated to run 105 days, but ultimately ran well over 200.|$|E
25|$|Jack Kramer, on {{the other}} hand, who became a {{world-class}} player in 1940 and then beat Gonzales badly in the latter's first year as a professional, has stated that he believes that although Gonzales was better than either Laver or Sampras he was {{not as good as}} either Ellsworth Vines or Don Budge. Kramer, who had a long and frequently bitter relationship with Gonzales, rates him only as one of the four players who are second <b>to</b> <b>Budge</b> and Vines in his estimation. Kramer also, perhaps surprisingly, writes that Bobby Riggs would have beaten Gonzales on a regular basis.|$|E

Computer Gaming World stated that Midnight Magic was a better game than Raster Blaster, but lamented the requirement of removing write protection from the floppy, thus voiding the warranty, {{in order to save}} high scores. The Commodore 64 Home Companion called the game [...] "extraordinarily realistic ... complete with all the features that make pinball so seductie".|$|R

25|$|The album's {{original}} mix, {{recorded in}} Detroit at both Hitsville and Golden World {{as well as}} United Sound Studios, was finalized on April 5, 1971. When Gordy listened to the mix, he cautioned Gaye of the album's potential of possibly alienating Gaye's core fan base, which was mostly women; however, Gaye refused <b>to</b> <b>budge.</b> Gaye and his engineers did a new sound mix of the album at The Sound Factory in West Hollywood in early May, integrating the orchestra somewhat closer with the rhythm tracks. Though Motown's Quality Control department team feared no other hit released from the album due to its concurrent style with each song leading to the next, Gordy surprisingly allowed this mix to be released that month.|$|E
25|$|The king let the Pope {{know the}} impossibility of the request, and the {{possible}} results if the Pope persisted, but – {{for better or worse}} – the Pope did persist, and refused to accept the king's suggestions of archbishops. At the time, incidentally and for different reasons, there were also four other unoccupied bishop's seats, where the king made suggestions to the Pope about candidates, but the Pope only accepted one of the candidates. Because the Pope refused <b>to</b> <b>budge</b> on the issue of Gustav Trolle, the king, influenced by Lutheran scholar Olaus Petri, in 1531 took it upon himself to appoint yet another archbishop, namely the brother of Olaus, Laurentius Petri. With this royal act, the Pope lost any influence over the Swedish Church.|$|E

25|$|By February 1810 Masséna, stalled for {{six months}} at the Lines of Torres Vedras, his men famished and demoralized, {{accepted}} {{the advice of his}} despondent lieutenants and began preparations to extricate the French army from Portugal. With his customary sang-froid Masséna drafted orders calling for the army to quit the Tagus abruptly between 4 and 6 March, aiming to secure Coimbra as a base from which to throw bridges over the Mondego River and afford the army a passage to safety. The French pursued a retrograde movement along the Mondego valleywhich Masséna had long contemplated, were it not for Napoleon's express orders forbidding him <b>to</b> <b>budge</b> from the Tagushoping for better foraging country as they exhausted their last reserves of biscuit.|$|E
25|$|Eight weeks later, in March, {{after all}} {{passenger}} ship had arrived, settlers voted to abandon surveying at Pito-one—where the swamps, repeated flooding and poor anchorage facilities were proving {{too much of}} an obstacle—and move the town to Wakefield's preferred location of Thorndon at Lambton Bay (later Lambton Quay), which was named in honour of Lord Durham. Surveyors quickly encountered problems, however, when they discovered the land selected for the new settlement was still inhabited by Māori, who expressed astonishment and bewilderment to find Pākehā tramping through their homes, gardens and cemeteries and driving wooden survey pegs into the ground. Surveyors became involved in skirmishes with the Māori, most of whom refused <b>to</b> <b>budge,</b> and were provided with weapons to continue their work.|$|E
25|$|There, Smuts was {{up against}} a hard-talking Orange River Colony delegation, who refused every one of Smuts' demands. Smuts had {{successfully}} predicted this opposition, and their objections, and tailored his own ambitions appropriately. He allowed compromise on {{the location of the}} capital, on the official language, and on suffrage, but he refused <b>to</b> <b>budge</b> on the fundamental structure of government. As the convention drew into autumn, the Orange leaders began to see a final compromise as necessary to secure the concessions that Smuts had already made. They agreed to Smuts' draft South African constitution, which was duly ratified by the South African colonies. Smuts and Botha took the constitution to London, where it was passed by Parliament and given Royal Assent by King Edward VII in December 1909.|$|E
50|$|From 1869 <b>to</b> 1878, <b>Budge</b> {{spent his}} free time {{studying}} Assyrian, and during these years, often spent his lunch break studying at St. Paul's Cathedral. John Stainer, the organist of St. Paul's, noticed Budge's hard work, and met the youth. He wanted to help the working-class boy realize his {{dream of becoming a}} scholar. Stainer contacted W.H. Smith, a Conservative Member of Parliament, and the former Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone, and asked them to help his young friend. Both Smith and Gladstone agreed to help Stainer to raise money for <b>Budge</b> <b>to</b> attend Cambridge University.|$|R

25|$|Thus, by the {{beginning}} of 1919 the positions taken up by those involved were fairly well defined. Robert Munro, himself a Highlander, believed passionately in the reinstatement of the crofts and he also felt strongly that the Westminster Parliament was unlikely to tolerate any departure from the implementation of land reform, but he saw no reason why Lewis should not have Leverhulme's industrial schemes as well as more crofts. Leverhulme refused <b>to</b> <b>budge,</b> believing that the break-up of his farms would lead to seriously inefficient, probably unsustainable, and ultimately abandoned smallholdings as crofters moved away in search of better incomes. Ranged against this at least ostensibly reasonable prediction was the formidable influence wielded by prospective crofters away fighting in France, as well as by supporters of the Highland League which was politically dedicated to land reform.|$|E
25|$|The {{approaches}} {{by each of}} {{the three}} Confederate brigades were uncoordinated. Rain, fog, mountainous terrain, and a dense forest limited visibility to minimal distances. As a result, {{each of the three}} Confederate brigades assigned to attack Cheat Summit Fort acted independently and never made contact with either of the other two Confederate brigades. The Union defenders on Cheat Summit were very familiar with the terrain and mountain trails. Information from captured Federal soldiers was so misleading and two Federal probing attacks from Cheat Summit Fort were so aggressive that Rust and Anderson, each leading approximately 1500 Confederates at Cheat Mountain, were convinced that an overwhelming force confronted them. Rust and Anderson withdrew their 3,000 men although they actually faced only about 300 determined Federals outside the Union fortifications. At Elk Water, Reynolds's brigade faced three more Confederate brigades but refused <b>to</b> <b>budge</b> from well-prepared entrenchments.|$|E
25|$|Moses envisioned New York's newest stadium {{being built}} in Queens' Flushing Meadows on the former (and as it turned out, future) site of the World's Fair, where it would {{eventually}} host {{all three of the}} city's major league teams of the day. O'Malley vehemently opposed this plan, citing the team's Brooklyn identity. Moses refused <b>to</b> <b>budge,</b> and after the 1957 season the Dodgers left for Los Angeles and the New York Giants left for San Francisco. Moses was later able to build the 55,000-seat multi-purpose Shea Stadium on the site; construction ran from October 1961 to its delayed completion in April 1964. The stadium attracted an expansion franchise: the New York Mets, who played at Shea until 2008, when the stadium was demolished and replaced with Citi Field. The New York Jets football team also played its home games at Shea from 1964 until 1983, after which the team moved its home games to the Meadowlands Sports Complex in New Jersey.|$|E
50|$|Budge {{was also}} {{interested}} in the paranormal, and believed in spirits and hauntings. Budge {{had a number of}} friends in the Ghost Club (British Library, Manuscript Collections, Ghost Club Archives), a group in London committed to the study of alternative religions and the spirit world. He told his many friends stories of hauntings and other uncanny experiences. Many people in his day who were involved with the occult and spiritualism after losing their faith in Christianity were dedicated <b>to</b> <b>Budge's</b> works, particularly his translation of the Egyptian Book of the Dead.
