40|$|The {{influence}} of {{the application of a}} filleted shape <b>trench</b> <b>hole</b> outlet on the overall cooling effectiveness of a flat hot effusion Nimonic 75 metal wall with a 770 K hot gas crossflow was investigated using conjugate heat transfer (CHT) CFD and the Ansys Fluent code. The baseline effusion wall had ten rows of holes with an X/D of 4. 65 and a wall thickness of 6. 35 mm with normal injection holes. This was modelled and showed good agreement with the experimental results for overall cooling effectiveness. The aim of the work was to use these validated CHT CFD procedures to investigate improved hole outlet designs with 30 ° inclined effusion of X/D = 4. 65 with improved hole outlet designs using various trench designs. The predictions involved the use of a gas tracer in the cooling air to simultaneously separate the predicted adiabatic film cooling effectiveness from the overall cooling effectiveness. The shaped trench outlet effusion wall designs were predicted to have a superior performance compared with the 90 ° effusion wall cooling design. This was due to the improved adiabatic film cooling. An increase in the trailing edge vertical wall depth of the trenched effusion wall design from 0. 5 D to 0. 75 D increased the overall and adiabatic cooling effectiveness. The filleted shaped trench outlet effusion wall only required a small amount of cooling air to achieve a satisfactory cooling performance. It was predicted that this new effusion wall design could enable a significant reduction in the coolant mass flow for cooled metal surfaces in in future high performance gas turbines...|$|E

30|$|Capillary {{force has}} been {{successfully}} exploited to place individual nanoscale/microscale building blocks into <b>trenches</b> or <b>holes</b> pre-defined on the substrate. In this approach [16 – 20], the substrate is immersed into a colloidal solution, and then slowly pulled out or slowly dried by solvent evaporation through heating. In both cases, the solution–air interface slowly recedes. At {{the front of the}} receding interface, the thickness of solution becomes smaller than the diameter of nanoparticles (for non-spherical shape, the height of the building blocks) and a three-phase solution–air–nanoparticle interface is formed around the nanoparticle surfaces. This three-phase interface creates capillary forces on the nanoparticles. The direction of the capillary force depends on thickness of the solution layer, which depends on the substrate pattern, thicker in the <b>trenches</b> or <b>holes.</b> The net result is that the nanoparticles are pushed into the <b>trenches</b> or <b>holes</b> while they pass through other areas without any deposition.|$|R

This set is based on early works [T. S. Cale and G. B. Raupp, J. Vac. Sci. Technol. B 8, 1242 (1990); V. K. Singh et al., J. Vac. Sci. Technol.

This method includes a coupling algorithm with a surface chemistry model. and resolves the singularity problem of the integral equations. Third, the fluxes inside <b>trenches</b> and <b>holes</b> are compared. The flux from reemission is the major portion of the local flux at the bottom of both types of structure.

40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} to calculate the step coverage of blanket tungsten low pressure chemical vapor deposition(W-LPCVD) from tungsten hexafluoride (WF 6). The model can calculate tungsten growth in trenches and circular contactholes, {{in the case of}} the WF 6 reduction by H 2, SiH 4, or both. The step coverage model predictions have been verified experimentallyby scanning electron microscopy (SEM). We found that the predictions of the step coverage model for the H 2 reductionof WF 6 are very accurate, if the partial pressures of the reactants at the inlet of the <b>trench</b> or contact <b>hole</b> areknown. To get these reactant inlet partial pressures, we used a reactor model which calculates the surface partial pressuresof all the reactants. These calculated surface partial pressures are used as input for our step coverage model. In this studywe showed that thermodiffusion plays a very important role in the actual surface partial pressure. In the case where SiH 4 was present in the gas mixture trends are predicted very well but the absolute values predicted by the step coveragemodel are too high. The partial pressure of HF, which is a by-product of the H 2 reduction reaction, may be very high insidetrenches or contact holes, especially just before closing of the <b>trench</b> or contact <b>hole.</b> We found no influence of the calculatedHF partial pressure on the step coverage. Differences between step coverage in <b>trenches</b> and contact <b>holes,</b> as predictedby the step coverage model, were found to agree with the experiments. It is shown that the combination of the stepcoverage and reactor model is very useful in the optimization towards high step coverage, high throughput, and low WF 6 flow. We found a perfect step coverage (no void formation) in a 2 µm wide and 10 µm deep (2 × 10 µm) trench using anaverage WF 6 flow of only 35 sccm, at a growth rate of 150 nm/min. In general, it is shown that the reduction of WF 6 by SiH 4 offers no advantages over the reduction by H 2 as far as step coverage is concerned. ...|$|R
40|$|Fabrication of {{high-speed}} semiconductor circuits depends on etching submicron <b>trenches</b> and <b>holes</b> with straight walls, guided by sheath-accelerated ions which strike the substrate at a normal angle. Electrons accumulate at the nonconductive entrance of each trench, charging it negatively and preventing the penetration of electrons {{to the bottom}} of the trench. This “electron shading” effect causes an ion charge at the bottom which is well known to cause damage to thin oxide layers. In addition, the deflection of ions by electric fields in the trench can cause deformation of the trench shape. To study this effect, we have calculated the ion orbits self-consistently with their charging of the trench walls. We find that a) the orbits depend only on the electric fields at the entrance and are sensitive to changes in the shape of the photoresist layer there; b) there is an “ion shading ” effect that protects part of the wall; and c) the number of ions striking the wall is too small to cause any deformation thereof. 1 I...|$|R

50|$|A second {{benefit of}} {{deposition}} within a discharge {{arises from the}} fact that electrons are more mobile than ions. As a consequence, the plasma is normally more positive than any object it is in contact with, as otherwise a large flux of electrons would flow from the plasma to the object. The difference in voltage between the plasma and the objects in its contacts normally occurs across a thin sheath region. Ionized atoms or molecules that diffuse {{to the edge of the}} sheath region feel an electrostatic force and are accelerated towards the neighboring surface. Thus, all surfaces exposed to the plasma receive energetic ion bombardment. The potential across the sheath surrounding an electrically-isolated object (the floating potential) is typically only 10-20 V, but much higher sheath potentials are achievable by adjustments in reactor geometry and configuration. Thus, films can be exposed to energetic ion bombardment during deposition. This bombardment can lead to increases in density of the film, and help remove contaminants, improving the film's electrical and mechanical properties. When a high-density plasma is used, the ion density can be high enough that significant sputtering of the deposited film occurs; this sputtering can be employed to help planarize the film and fill <b>trenches</b> or <b>holes.</b>|$|R
