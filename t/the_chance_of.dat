50|$|A {{proportioning}} valve {{may be used}} to reduce the pressure to the rear brakes under heavy braking. This limits the rear braking to reduce <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> locking up <b>the</b> rear brakes, and greatly lessens <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> a spin.|$|R

50|$|In one study, {{physicians}} {{were asked}} to give <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> malignancy with a 1% prior probability of occurring. A test can detect 80% of malignancies and has a 10% false positive rate. What is the probability of malignancy given a positive test result? Approximately 95 out of 100 physicians responded the probability of malignancy would be about 75%, apparently because the physicians believed that <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> malignancy given a positive test result were approximately the same as <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> a positive test result given malignancy.|$|R

5|$|After {{incubating}} {{for around}} 80 days, hatchlings dig through the sand to the surface, usually at night, when darkness increases <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> escaping predation and damage from extreme sand surface temperatures is reduced.

5|$|Another theory {{states that}} {{chromosomal}} toxin-antitoxin systems {{are designed to}} be bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal. RelE, for example, is a global inhibitor of translation during nutrient stress, and its expression reduces <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> starvation by lowering the cell's nutrient requirements. A homologue of mazF toxin called mazF-mx is essential for fruiting body formation in Myxococcus xanthus.|$|E

5|$|Credit Suisse {{developed}} the CreditRisk+ model of risk assessment in loans, which is focused exclusively on <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> default {{based on the}} exogenous Poisson method. As of 2002 about 20 percent of Credit Suisse's revenue was from its insurance business it gained through the 1997 acquisition of Winterthur. The investment bank's insurance products are primarily popular in the domestic market and include auto, fire, property, life, disability, pension and retirement products among others. Historically 20–40 percent of the bank's revenue has been from private banking services, one of its higher profit-margin divisions.|$|E
5|$|Drug {{overdose}} and intoxication {{are significant}} causes of accidental death, {{and can also}} be used as a form of suicide. Death can occur from overdosing on a single or multiple drugs, or from combined drug intoxication (CDI) due to poly drug use. Poly drug use often carries more risk than use of a single drug, due to an increase in side effects, and drug synergy. For example, <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> death from overdosing on opiates is greatly increased when they are consumed in conjunction with alcohol. While they are two distinct phenomena, deaths from CDI are often misreported as overdoses. Drug overdoses and intoxication can also cause indirect deaths. For example, while marijuana does not cause fatal overdoses, being intoxicated by it can increase <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> fatal traffic collisions.|$|E
5|$|Early {{treatment}} increases <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> a good outcome. Treatment {{consists of}} stabilizing the person, {{followed by the}} use of an antidote. The preferred antidote is fomepizole with ethanol used if this is not available. Hemodialysis may also be used in those where there is organ damage or a high degree of acidosis. Other treatments may include sodium bicarbonate, thiamine, and magnesium.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the remnant}} low {{associated}} with Josephine {{began to show}} signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on September7.

The National Hurricane Center did not state <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> regeneration once the low became exposed. Finally, on September 9, wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of Josephine deteriorating into an open wave. However, on September10, the remnants of Josephine redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system.
