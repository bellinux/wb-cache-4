Men logged on more often, spent more time online, and {{were more likely to be}} broadband users, whereas women tended to make more use of opportunities to communicate (such as email). Men were more likely to use the Internet <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>bills,</b> participate in auctions, and for recreation such as downloading music and videos. Men and women were equally likely to use the Internet for shopping and banking.|$|E
25|$|Sweden has {{a system}} for credit scoring that aims to find people {{with a history of}} neglect <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>bills</b> or, most commonly, taxes. Anyone who does not pay their debts on time, and fails to make {{payments}} after a reminder, will have their case forwarded to the Swedish Enforcement Authority which is a national authority for collecting debts. The mere appearance of a company, or government office, as a debtor to this authority will result in a record among private credit bureaus; however, this does not apply to individuals as debtors. This record is called a Betalningsanmärkning (non-payment record) and by law can be stored for three years for an individual and five years for a company. This kind of nonpayment record will make it very difficult to get a loan, rent an apartment, get telephone subscriptions, rent a car or get a job where you handle cash. The banks, also use income and asset figures in connection with loan assessments.|$|E

25|$|By {{the timing}} of collection, VAT (as well as {{accounting}} in general) can be either accrual or cash based. Cash basis accounting is a very simple form of accounting. When a payment is received {{for the sale of}} goods or services, a deposit is made, and the revenue is recorded as of the date of the receipt of funds—no matter when the sale had been made. Cheques are written when funds are available <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>bills,</b> and the expense is recorded as of the cheque date—regardless of when the expense had been incurred. The primary focus is on the amount of cash in the bank, and the secondary focus is on making sure all bills are paid. Little effort is made to match revenues to the time period in which they are earned, or to match expenses to the time period in which they are incurred. Accrual basis accounting matches revenues to the time period in which they are earned and matches expenses to the time period in which they are incurred. While it is more complex than cash basis accounting, it provides much more information about your business. The accrual basis allows you to track receivables (amounts due from customers on credit sales) and payables (amounts due to vendors on credit purchases). The accrual basis allows you to match revenues to the expenses incurred in earning them, giving you more meaningful financial reports.|$|E
500|$|Selena gave Saldívar her American Express {{card for}} the purpose of {{conducting}} company business. Saldívar, however, instead used it to rent Lincoln Town Cars, entertain associates in upmarket restaurants, and buy two cellular telephones which she carried. Staff at Selena Etc. complained that Saldívar was always [...] "nice" [...] when Selena was around; when she was not Saldívar treated everyone terribly. In December 1994, the boutiques began to suffer. The company's bank accounts lacked sufficient funds <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>bills.</b> Staff levels at both stores had been reduced from thirty-eight to fourteen employees, mainly because Saldívar fired those she did not like. The remaining employees began complaining to Selena about Saldívar, but Selena did not believe her friend would hurt her or her business. The employees then began to take their concerns to Quintanilla, Jr. who warned Selena that Saldívar might be a dangerous person. Selena did not believe Saldívar would turn on her; her father had a habit of distrusting people.|$|E
500|$|When Tillman {{spoke at}} Bennettsville, {{he was not}} widely known except as the brother of Congressman George Tillman. Ben Tillman called for the state {{government}} to do more for farmers, and blamed politicians and lawyers in the pay of financial interests for agricultural problems, including the crop lien system that left many farmers struggling <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>bills.</b> He assailed his listeners for letting themselves be duped by hostile interests, and told of the farmer who {{was elected to the}} legislature, only to be dazzled and seduced by the elite. According to an account the next day in the Columbia Daily Register, Tillman's speech [...] "electrified the assembly and was the sensation of the meeting". Lindsey Perkins, in his journal article on Tillman's oratory, wrote that [...] "Tillman's losses in the agricultural depression of 1883–1898 forced him to begin thinking and planning economic reforms. The result was Bennettsville." [...] Tillman later stated that he began his advocacy after a few bad years in the early 1880s forced him to sell some of his land. The speech was printed in several newspapers, and Tillman began to receive more invitations to speak. According to Zach McGhee in his 1906 article on Tillman, [...] "from that day to this he has been the most conspicuous figure in South Carolina".|$|E

50|$|Simply failing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> a <b>bill</b> when due is {{generally}} not a crime in most circumstances or jurisdictions. It is a contract debt, and the act is civil rather than criminal in nature. However, there are often laws that apply specifically to restaurants, hotels, and other circumstances, where the presumption is that the customer intended <b>to</b> never <b>pay</b> their <b>bill</b> in advance and therefore obtained the valuable services under false pretenses, a form of criminal fraud. In certain states, dining and dashing is not labelled as a criminal issue. For example, in California, it is considered a petty theft, while in Mississippi, it is a felony offense <b>to</b> refuse <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> a <b>bill</b> over $25.00.|$|R
