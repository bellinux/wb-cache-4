25|$|Wagner {{was also}} emboldened {{by the death}} of Mendelssohn in 1847, the {{popularity}} of whose conservative style he felt was cramping the potential of German music.

25|$|In England, {{some of the}} Cambridge Platonists {{approached}} hylozoism as well. Both Henry More and Ralph Cudworth (the Younger, 1617–1688), {{through their}} reconciliation of Platonic idealism with Christian doctrines of deific generation, {{came to see the}} divine lifeforce as the informing principle in the world. Thus, like Bruno, but not nearly to the extreme, they saw God's generative impulse as giving life to all things that exist. Accordingly, Cudworth, the most systematic metaphysician of the Cambridge Platonist tradition, fought hylozoism. His work is primarily a critique of what he <b>took</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the two principal forms of atheism. i.e. materialism and hylozoism.|$|E
25|$|Then {{came the}} old carpenter, Le Challeux, with another party of refugees, {{through the water}} and the tall grass.

They passed the night in a grove of trees in view of the sea, and the following morning, as they were struggling through a large swamp, they observed some men half hidden by the vegetation, whom they <b>took</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a party of Spaniards come down to cut them off.

25|$|With the UK {{success of}} Family's first two albums, the band {{undertook}} {{a tour of}} the United States in April 1969, but it was beset by problems. Halfway through the tour, Grech unexpectedly left the band to join the new supergroup Blind Faith; on the recommendation of tour manager Peter Grant, Grech was replaced by John Weider, previously of Eric Burdon and The Animals. A further setback occurred during their first concert at Bill Graham's Fillmore East, whilst sharing the bill with Ten Years After and The Nice – during his stage routine, Chapman lost control of his microphone stand, which flew in Graham's direction, an act Graham <b>took</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> deliberate; Chapman performed the following shows with his hands by his sides, {{and by the end of}} the tour he had lost his voice; Family's reputation in the US never recovered and they ultimately never achieved great recognition there.|$|E

25|$|Judge Dredd {{had survived}} however, {{and with the}} help of a handful of colleagues who had escaped being brainwashed such as Judge Giant, he led a revolt by the {{citizens}} against Cal's insane tyranny. But Cal had anticipated this and recruited an army of alien mercenaries, the Kleggs, a reptilian race of soldiers-for-hire. The revolt was quickly quashed with widespread loss of life. Dredd and the small number of survivors went into hiding and began a guerrilla campaign of resistance. However Cal decided to punish Mega City One by sentencing the entire population to death; he did this in alphabetical order beginning with the unfortunate Aaron A. Aardvark. Execution chambers were set up all over the city. Dredd managed to stop the executions by having Deputy Chief Judge Fish assassinated, which the superstitious Cal <b>took</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an omen that the executions would lead to the death of the judges as well. However, when no citizens turned up for his pet's funeral he decided to punish the citizens by passing even more draconian laws. He appointed Grampus, the Klegg leader, as his new deputy and encouraged children to snoop on their parents if they said anything against his leadership. These and a wave of other measures made life intolerable for the beleaguered citizens.|$|E
25|$|Between about 3000 and 1000 BC {{speakers}} of Austronesian languages {{spread through the}} islands of Southeast Asia – almost certainly starting out from Taiwan, as tribes whose natives were thought to have previously arrived from mainland South China about 8000 years ago – into the edges of western Micronesia and on into Melanesia. In the archaeological record there are well-defined traces of this expansion which allow the path it <b>took</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> followed and dated {{with a degree of}} certainty. In the mid-2nd millennium BC a distinctive culture appeared suddenly in north-west Melanesia, in the Bismarck Archipelago, the chain of islands forming a great arch from New Britain to the Admiralty Islands. This culture, known as Lapita, stands out in the Melanesian archeological record, with its large permanent villages on beach terraces along the coasts. Particularly characteristic of the Lapita culture is the making of pottery, including a great many vessels of varied shapes, some distinguished by fine patterns and motifs pressed into the clay. Within a mere three or four centuries between about 1300 and 900 BC, the Lapita culture spread 6000km further to the east from the Bismarck Archipelago, until it reached as far as Tonga and Samoa. In this region, the distinctive Polynesian culture developed. The Polynesians are then believed to have spread eastward from the Samoan Islands into the Marquesas, the Society Islands, the Hawaiian Islands and Easter Island; and south to New Zealand. The pattern of settlement also extended to the north of Samoa to the Tuvaluan atolls, with Tuvalu providing a stepping stone to migration into the Polynesian Outlier communities in Melanesia and Micronesia.|$|E
