5|$|To this dreadful monster the effluvium of <b>the</b> <b>weasel</b> is fatal, a {{thing that}} has been tried with success, for kings have often desired to see its body when killed; so true is it that it has pleased Nature {{that there should be}} nothing without its antidote. The animal is thrown into the hole of the basilisk, which is easily known from the soil around it being infected. <b>The</b> <b>weasel</b> destroys the basilisk by its odour, but dies itself in this {{struggle}} of nature against its own self.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas where}} the least weasel is {{sympatric}} with the stoat, the two species {{compete with each other}} for rodent prey. <b>The</b> <b>weasel</b> manages to avoid too much competition by living in more upland areas, feeding on smaller prey and being capable of entering smaller holes. It actively avoids encounters with stoats, though female weasels are less likely to stop foraging in the presence of stoats, perhaps because their smaller size allows them to quickly escape into holes.|$|E
5|$|The {{red panda}} {{is the only}} living species of the genus Ailurus and the family Ailuridae.

Two subspecies are recognized. It is not closely related to the giant panda, which is a basal ursid.|$|E

However, Toad refuses to listen to Badger and is ultimately arrested for stealing and crashing a motor-car outside a pub. During his trial, Toad's defence lawyer is no help at all.

5|$|The river otter, {{a member}} of the {{subfamily}} Lutrinae in <b>the</b> <b>weasel</b> family (Mustelidae), is equally versatile in the water and on land. It establishes a burrow close to the water's edge in river, lake, swamp, coastal shoreline, tidal flat, or estuary ecosystems. The den typically has many tunnel openings, one of which generally allows the otter to enter and exit the body of water. Female otters give birth in these underground burrows, producing litters of one to six young.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} (Enhydra lutris) is a marine mammal {{native to the}} coasts of the {{northern}} and eastern North Pacific Ocean. Adult sea otters typically weigh between , making them the heaviest members of <b>the</b> <b>weasel</b> family, but among the smallest marine mammals. Unlike most marine mammals, the sea otter's primary form of insulation is an exceptionally thick coat of fur, the densest in the animal kingdom. Although it can walk on land, the sea otter lives mostly in the ocean.|$|E

The fisher is closely related to but larger than the American marten (Martes americana). The fisher is a forest-dwelling creature whose range covers much of the boreal forest in Canada to the northern United States. Names derived from aboriginal languages include pekan, pequam, wejack, and woolang. It is also called a fisher cat, although it is not a feline.|$|E
50|$|After {{slipping}} {{through a}} grating cover, <b>the</b> <b>weasels</b> worm {{their way down}} through the underground rivers and enter an otter colony, where they meet Sleek, an otter obsessed with fashion. Back at Castle Rayn, Prince Poynt appears cleverer than he looks, and tells Sheriff Falshed to follow <b>the</b> <b>weasels</b> and obstruct them in their quest. After allowing him to free them, <b>the</b> <b>weasels</b> then enter an open lake where they meet their old friend Sheriff Falshed, who has been knocked unconscious by the fall from the cliff.

5|$|In {{the final}} chapter of the game, Conker and Berri are enlisted by Don Weaso, head of <b>the</b> <b>Weasel</b> Mafia, to rob a bank. After {{entering}} the vault, they find that the bank scene was an elaborate trap set by the King and Don Weaso to capture Conker. In the ensuing confrontation, Berri steps in to handle the confrontation for Conker, but is gunned down by Weaso under orders by the Panther King. Afterwards, he calls over Professor Von Kriplespac when he begins having trouble breathing, and Von Kriplespac takes Conker aside to watch as a large Xenomorph suddenly bursts out of the Panther King's chest, killing him instantly. Von Kriplespac explains that the alien, whom he had named Heinrich, {{is one of his}} creations and that he had planned to use this opportunity to kill the King and escape captivity. Kriplespac then reveals that they are all actually inside a spaceship, which he activates and takes into low orbit. From there, he instructs Heinrich to attack and kill Conker as revenge for destroying the Tediz, which were also his creations. Conker pulls a switch that opens an air lock, pulling Von Kriplespac and the corpses of Berri and the Panther King into space. After Conker briefly battles Heinrich {{with the aid of a}} robotic suit, Heinrich takes one last lunge at him, when suddenly the entire game freezes. Conker expresses disbelief that the developers of the game apparently did not beta test the game properly, and breaks the fourth wall to ask some software engineers to assist him in his current situation. The programmers give Conker a Katana and teleport him to the Panther King's throne room, where he decapitates Heinrich. As a result, he is crowned the new King of the land.|$|E

500|$|Until the 1990s, {{there was}} some dispute over the taxonomic status of the species. [...] For much of the 20th century, the small-toothed {{sportive}} lemur was considered a subspecies of <b>the</b> <b>weasel</b> sportive lemur (Lepilemur mustelinus). [...] In his book The Primates of Madagascar from 1982, primatologist Ian Tattersall deviated from the traditional view by considering L.microdon a synonym of <b>the</b> <b>weasel</b> sportive lemur, while also recognizing only a single species of sportive lemur. [...] Tattersall based his decision on what he {{considered to be a}} lack of detailed anatomical studies and field surveys, while also factoring in the difficulty in observing the animals in the wild, the presence of only subtle variations among museum specimens, and his own unwillingness to consider differences in karyotypes as grounds for defining distinct species. [...] However, primatologist Russell Mittermeier, etal. in Lemurs of Madagascar (1994), taxonomist Colin Groves in Mammal Species of the World (2005), and others favored recognizing the small-toothed sportive lemur as a species while also recognizing a total of seven sportive lemur species.|$|E

500|$|According to {{a review}} by Henry Ogg Forbes in 1894, the species differs from other {{sportive}} lemurs—as its name suggests—by having significantly smaller molar teeth. [...] Forbes also claimed that compared with <b>the</b> <b>weasel</b> sportive lemur, its bony palate is longer {{and it has}} a depression {{at the base of the}} nasal (nose) region. [...] Like other sportive lemurs, the cecum (beginning of the large intestine) is enlarged, presumably to handle its leaf-rich diet, which is more characteristic of larger primates.|$|E
500|$|The 2011 {{revision}} of the C++ Standard removed <b>the</b> <b>weasel</b> words requiring that allocators of a given type always compare equal and use normal pointers.

The current purpose of allocators {{is to give the}} programmer control over memory allocation within containers, rather than to adapt the address model of the underlying hardware. [...] In fact, the revised standard eliminated the ability of allocators to represent extensions to the C++ address model, formally (and deliberately) eliminating their original purpose.|$|E
500|$|The small-toothed {{sportive}} lemur (Lepilemur microdon), or small-toothed weasel lemur, is a primate {{species in}} the family Lepilemuridae that—like all lemurs—is endemic to Madagascar.

[...] Described in 1894, it was considered either a subspecies or taxonomic synonym of <b>the</b> <b>weasel</b> sportive lemur (Lepilemur mustelinus) throughout most of the 20th century. [...] Phylogenetic studies not only support its species status, but also suggest that it is the only eastern Malagasy sportive lemur that is more closely related to western than to other eastern species.|$|E
