In 2008 the COC-IEO began the study of horse mackerel (<b>Trachurus</b> <b>spp.)</b> under commercial codification “JAX”. Discharges were about 1, 500 tonnes in that year (22 fishing trips) and 2, 000 tonnes in 2009 (29 fishing trips). During this period, 5, 180 specimens of these commercial catches were analyzed.

40|$|Artificial reefs (ARs) {{have been}} {{deployed}} in Algarve (Southern Portugal) coastal waters {{to contribute to the}} sustainability of local nearshore fisheries. Herein, we describe the colonization process of the recently deployed Faro/Ancao AR, and assess the time until the fish assemblage reaches stability and their seasonal patterns. In addition, we compare the results from the present study with those previously reported for an older AR. The fish assemblages were monitored monthly over a 2 -year period by means of visual census. A rapid increase in fish colonization occurred within the first 4 months. After this initial period the assemblage structure showed high similarity (> 73 %). The high rate of colonization of the AR was related to the maturity already achieved by the nearby 14 -year-old AR and to the fish migration from the Ria Formosa lagoon, a nearby nursery habitat. The reef fish assemblage structure showed a seasonal pattern, mainly associated with recruitment episodes of occasional demersal species (Boops boops, Trachurus <b>trachurus</b> and Pagellus <b>spp.)</b> in spring and summer. A total of 66 % of the species found in AR are of commercial and recreational importance. The overall mean density and biomass were 2. 8 ind. m(- 3) and 207 g. m(- 3). The occasional demersal species accounted for 42 % of the fish density. The most important species in terms of biomass belong to the Sparidae family along with Dicentrarchus labrax. The fish assemblage of the new ARs showed higher mean number of species, diversity, density and biomass values than those reported for the older AR. This result was associated with enlargement of the AR area and with the fishing exploitation of the isolated, small and patchy old AR. Moreover, the high biomass values recorded in the new ARs were mainly due to the increased density of D. labrax after AR enlargement.

The diet of a pelagic teleost, Arripis trutta, was examined in the East Australian Current (EAC) -dominated coastal waters of southeastern (SE) Australia. The diet of A. trutta was dominated by pelagic baitfish, primarily Australian sardine (Sardinops sagax) and scads (<b>Trachurus</b> <b>spp.).</b> Diet varied substantially with both latitude and season linked to variability in the distribution and abundance of key prey species.

The diet of A. trutta has undergone a dramatic shift from one dominated by krill (Nyctiphanes australis) historically to baitfish today.

Stratified sampling by onboard observers took place from February 1999 to March 2001 and {{data were collected from}} 165 tows during 52 fishing trips. Commercial tat-get species included crustaceans: blue and red shrimp (Aristeus antennatus), deep-water rose shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris), Norway lobster (Nepharops norvegicus); and fishes: scabreams (Diplodus spl). and Pagellus Spp.), horse Mackerels (<b>Trachurus</b> <b>spp.)</b> and European hake (Merluccius merluccius).

40|$|New Zealand common {{dolphins}} (Delphinus delphis) {{are subject}} {{to a range of}} human-induced threats including fisheries bycatch and tourism impacts. Common dolphins are incidentally captured in the trawl fishery for jack mackerel (<b>Trachurus</b> <b>spp)</b> and appear susceptible to entanglement within coastal set nets. Pollutant burdens and tourism impacts reported for New Zealand population appear in line with those previously reported for coastal conspecifics such as the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). Despite this, common dolphins remain the most poorly understood delphinid within New Zealand waters. Until recently, majority of the information relating to their identity, abundance and ecology had relied upon untested assumptions. This lack of empirical data has historically resulted in the inadequate recognition of this species. To date, common dolphins remain the only resident cetacean within New Zealand to lack a species-specific Marine Mammal Action Plan. This is of concern, since fundamental data necessary to assess their status and stability remain unknown for the New Zealand population. Limited insights offered by strandings and opportunistic sightings data suggest the coastal distribution of New Zealand Delphinus may, at least in part, offer some explanation as to why common dolphins within these waters appear vulnerable to human-induced impacts.

40|$|This {{represents}} the first mesoscale study linking larval fish assemblages and water masses off south-eastern Australia, aimed at characterising the pelagic shelf ecosystem within the region. Data were collected during five intensive ichthyoplankton surveys carried out between 24. 6 °S and 41. 7 °S (- 1050 nm), {{that included the}} coastlines of southern Queensland (Qld), New South Wales (NSW), eastern Victoria (Vic) and north-eastern Tasmania (Tas). Surveys were conducted in spring 2002 and 2003 (Qld-NSW), summer 2003 (NSW-Tas), summer 2004 (NSW-Vic) and winter 2004 (Qld-NSW). A total of 371 vertical plankton samples were obtained via a bongo sampler simultaneously with physical oceanographic variables to a maximum depth of 200 m. A novel multivariate approach was developed and employed to define water masses using temperature frequencies from OTD-derived profiles. While this approach departs from traditional methods, {{it proved to be}} an effective and objective method of delineating water masses, even when indistinct current structures existed. Up to three discrete water masses were identified during individual surveys, namely East Australian Current (EAO) to the north, Tasman Sea (TAS) to the south, and a mixed water mass (MIX) containing EAOTAS water in between. Surveys yielded a total of 24, 135 larval fishes representing 150 taxa from 101 families. Epipelagic taxa dominated the larval fish community contributing 41 - 633 to the total numbers caught across each survey, with <b>Trachurus</b> <b>spp.</b> (27. 73), Sardinops sagax (17. 93) and Lophonectes gallus (3. 83) being most abundant. Distinct larval fish assemblages identified via multivariate analyses corresponded directly to identified water masses in terms of their spatial distribution. Assemblage composition differed significantly between water masses, with EAO and TAS being most dissimilar. Such contrast was due to tropical, subtropical and temperate taxa in EAO, primarily temperate taxa in TAS, and a combination of EAO and T AS taxa within MIX, the latter being consistent with the convergence of both water masses. Discriminator taxa between the recurrent EAO and TAS assemblages included labrids and Bregmaceros spp. in EAO, as well as L. gallus and Macroramphosus spp. in TAS. Further, both water mass and assemblage boundaries were found to be dynamic, shifting spatially and temporally depending on the strength of the EAO. Analyses on individual taxa revealed larval habitats pointing to distinct water mass preferences, while water mass interfaces often acted as a barrier to larval dispersal. Moreover, habitats of the abundant small pelagic taxa, namely Etrumeus teres, S. sagax, Engraulis australis, <b>Trachurus</b> <b>spp.</b> and Scomber australasicus, were similar, and appeared closely linked to the extent, strength and timing of the seasonal EAO cycle. Overall results highlight the strength of integrating ichthyoplankton dynamics and oceanography, and set a foundation for future adaptive biophysical surveys, particularly in relation to understanding larval transport mechanisms and spawning stock habitats for key pelagic species. Ultimately, links between biological and physical factors will assist in understanding the potential effects of climate change on the distribution and abundance of fish stocks within the region...|$|E

Two working hypotheses are presented to test whether or not "differences exist in fish assemblages at i) the spatial and ii) the temporal level". Quantitative and qualitative experimental data were obtained from a total of 521 censuses at 17 fish aggregation devices (FAD) using underwater visual observations carried out in Sardinia and Sicily in May-October 2001 and 2002 and a purse seine data set on 3 FADs obtained from a previous investigation carried out in Majorca. The results from the multivariate analysis rejected both hypotheses.

We concluded that differences noted were principally due to the "time shift" in the occurrence of these species in the three locations, leading to the assumption that a relationship did exist between the gradual but significant shift in seasonal temperature and colonization at the study locations.

This study aims to advance knowledge of the discards associated with the deep water rose shrimp fisheries in the south-central Mediterranean Sea. We address this issue by examining the data collected within the module of commercial catch monitoring (Campbiol) of European data collection framework (DCF) between January 2009 and December 2013. Multivariate data analysis and the generalized additive model (GAMs) were used to assess the spatio-temporal composition of the discard and factors influencing its distribution. Overall, discard represented 32. 9 ± 15. 4 % of the total catch. Multiple analysis of variance highlighted the significant effect on discard assemblage only for the factor of depth (p-value < 0. 05). In general, bony fish were the most discarded organisms (23. 5 ± 14. 4 %). Cartilaginous fish, crustaceans and other invertebrates represented approximately 13 % of the total catch. The fraction of discard in the catch presented significant variation regarding the years, depth and fishing ground. Our results showed that most of the discards in the deep water rose shrimp (DPS) fisheries are due to species that have a minimum legal size (Hake, DPS, <b>Trachurus</b> <b>spp.),</b> and are consequently subjected to the discard ban (art. 15 of the reg.

The recent development of new mathematical models and the increased availability of powerful computers have resulted in improvements in the analysis procedures for the data produced to measure a gear ’ s selectivity. The catch of mackerel in the gulfofGuineahas steeply declined during the last two decades, and resource management is clearly required. Therefore, the need for evaluation of trawl codends used in this fishery and the potential improvements to their selectivit y are of prime importance. In this paper, we use semi-empirical models to define selective properties of pelagic trawl codends targeting black mackerel (<b>Trachurus</b> <b>spp)</b> in theGulfofGuinea. These properties are determined using the experimental and theoretical methods of assessing the parameters of the selectivity curve, and by plotting the curve. Selection parameters were obtained by fitting a logistic equation using a maximum likelihood method. Trawl codend selectivity is estimated for 17 internal diamond mesh sizes in the range 47 - 79 mm. Using the basic selectivity equations, we determine the needed mesh size A = 58 mm for fishing mackerel in the gulf of Guinea. This nominal mesh size gives room for n j = 0. 1 catch of juveniles, which not exceeds the allowable proportion [n j] = 0. 1. To provide resource conservation, there is the need to make amendments in the fishery regulations for more rational exploitation of mackerel stoks, because the currently use nominal mesh size A = 56 mm is rather unselective. </p...|$|E
40|$|This work {{describes}} the diet, through {{the analysis of}} stomach contents, of different species of cetaceans in Andalusian waters. Stomachs of 53 specimens, 36 striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba), 13 common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) and 4 Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus) stranded in the provinces of Cadiz, Huelva, Malaga and Almeria (South Iberian Peninsula) were examined. Strandings were attended {{by members of the}} official stranding network of Andalusia. Fourteen of the specimens had no food remains in the stomachs: 9 striped dolphins, 2 common dolphins and 1 Risso´s dolphin. Prey remains consisted mostly of hard structures e. g. fish otoliths, bones and eye lenses, cephalopod jaws and eye lenses and crustaceans exoskeletons. These remains were identified using published guides (e. g. Clarke, 1986; Härkonen, 1986; Xavier & Cherel, 2009) and reference material available at the Centro Oceanográfico in Vigo of the Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO). Diet was characterised for each cetacean species using three standard indices, calculated for each category of prey and for group totals: the frequency of occurrence in the stomachs, the number of individuals and the reconstructed prey weight. These indices were also expressed as percentages to allow comparison between cetacean species and groups (e. g. dolphin sex and area of stranding). The results indicate that striped dolphins feed predominantly on small mesopelagic fish, mainly species of the Myctophidae family, although pearlsides (Maurolicus muelleri) were also present. Significant numbers of gobies (Gobiidae) were also found in the stomachs. Other prey identified were hake (Merluccius merluccius), silvery pout (Gadiculus argenteus), bogue (Boops boops) and scads (<b>Trachurus</b> <b>spp.).</b> Because of the degree of erosion of some otoliths they could not be identified to species level. Cephalopods were also found in the stomachs of striped dolphins with specimens of the families Brachioteuthidae, Chiroteuthidae, Sepiolidae, Ommastrephidae and Enoploteuthidae among others being identified from the remains. For common dolphin, myctophids were also important in the diet. Scads were also present. The 3 non-empty stomachs of Risso´s dolphin examined contained only cephalopod beaks (e. g. Todarodes sagittatus, several species of Histioteuthidae, Octopus vulgaris, etc.) confirming the teutophagous diet of this species already reported in other areas (Blanco et al., 2006) ...|$|E
40|$|The present working {{document}} summarises the main {{results from the}} Spanish (pelagic ecosystem‐) acoustic survey conducted by IEO between 2 nd and 13 th August 2013 in the Portuguese and Spanish shelf waters (20 ‐ 200 m isobaths) off the Gulf of Cadiz onboard the R/V “Cornide de Saavedra”. The survey dates were somewhat delayed {{in relation to the}} usual ones and to the anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) peak spawning as well. Abundance and biomass estimates are given for all the mid‐sized and small pelagic fish species susceptible of being acoustically assessed according to their occurrence and abundance levels in the study area. The distribution of these species is also shown from the mapping of their back‐scattering energies. The bulk of the anchovy population was concentrated in the Spanish shelf, with a residual nucleus to the west of Cape Santa Maria. A delay of the usual survey dates may be the reason of a higher relative importance of smaller anchovies in the population as a probable consequence of the incorporation of the first waves of recently recruited juveniles to the adult population. The total biomass estimated for anchovy was 8. 5 thousand tonnes (609 million fish), the lowest estimate in its series. Sardine showed a distribution pattern almost complementary to that described for anchovy, with higher densities occurring over the inner‐middle shelf of both extremes of the surveyed area, mainly west to Cape Santa Maria, and in shallower waters than anchovy. Sardine yielded a total of 9. 7 thousand tonnes (232 million fish). The 2013 sardine estimate was also the lowest one in its series and corroborates a clear recent decline in the population which has also been evidenced by the PELAGO surveys. Chub mackerel was present all over the surveyed area although showed a more “oceanic” distribution in the westernmost waters. The species was the most important in terms of assessed biomass, rendering estimates of 31. 3 thousand tonnes (333 million fish). Acoustic estimates for jack and horse‐mackerel species (<b>Trachurus</b> <b>spp.),</b> and bogue (Boops boops) are also given in the WD. No acoustic estimates either for mackerel S. scombrus or round sardinella (Sardinella aurita) were computed because their incidental occurrence in the study area during the survey...|$|E
40|$|The present working {{document}} summarises the main {{results from the}} Spanish acoustic (pelagic ecosystem‐) survey conducted by IEO between 25 th July and 1 st August 2010 in the Portuguese (but with an incomplete coverage) and Spanish shelf waters (20 ‐ 200 m isobaths) off the Gulf of Cadiz onboard the R/V “Cornide de aavedra”. The survey season was coincident with the anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) peak spawning to achieve an acoustic estimate of its SSB {{in the study area}} as well. This year the surveyed area was reduced to an area limited by the waters placed between Cape Trafalgar and Cape Santa Maria. Abundance and biomass estimates are given for all the mid‐sized and small pelagic fish species susceptible of being acoustically assessed according to their occurrence and abundance levels in the study area. The distribution of these species is also shown from the mapping of their back‐scattering energies. In the sampled area, anchovy was distributed all over the shelf of the study area with the densest concentrations being recorded over the middle‐outer shelf in the westernmost area. The total biomass estimated for anchovy was 12. 3 thousand tonnes (954 million fish) and sustained, as an average, by maller anchovies than those observed the last year. Sardine (Sardina pilchardus) occurred all over the inner‐middle shelf, in shallower waters than anchovy, and also showing the highest densities in the westernmost coastal waters of the sampled area. The species was the most important one in terms of both biomass (67 thousand tonnes) and abundance (2 thousand million fish) and showed vidences of a relatively good recruitment. Chub mackerel (Scomber colias) was almost absent in the shallower waters and in the whole central part of the sampled area. This species was amongst the species which less contributed to the total biomass and abundance of the pelagic species assemblage, with almost 3 thousand tonnes and 43 million fish only. Acoustic estimates for jack and horse‐mackerel species (<b>Trachurus</b> <b>spp.),</b> and bogue (Boops boops) are also given in the WD. No acoustic estimates either for mackerel S. scombrus or round sardinella (Sardinella aurita) were computed because their incidental occurrence or even absence in the study area during the survey. Because of the problems with the acoustic sampling coverage, results from this survey are not directly comparable with those provided by IPIMAR from its PELAGO 10 spring survey, although some inferences on the most recent trends in the population levels of the main species may still be raised.

40|$|The {{life cycle}} of Anisakis simplex in New Zealand waters is {{described}} from observations on the morphology, distribution and behaviour of free-living and parasitic stages. Comparison with the life cyles of two other anisakids, Phocanema decipiens Myers 1959 and Thynnascaris adunca Rudolphi 1802 shows differences in distribution, degrees of host specificity, the status of invertebrate hosts, the factors influencing infestation levels of teleost hosts, and the location and pathological effects of infestation. Larval stages occurring in intermediate and paratenic hosts were identified by comparison of larval and adult morphometrics. A. simplex larvae were also positively identified by in vitro cultivation through to adults. Some morphometric variations compared to overseas descriptions are apparent. The ventriculus of A. simplex larvae is shorter relative to body length and the intestinal caecum of P. decipiens is longer relative to ventriculus length. Egg and free-living larval stages were obtained from in vitro cultivation of (A. simplex) and collection of eggs from mature adults from definitive hosts (T. adunca). Eggs of P. decipiens were not obtained. Eggs of A. simplex and T. adunca hatch in 8 - 11 days at 15 [degrees] C. A. simplex eggs hatch in 6 days at a temperature of 22 [degrees] C and did not hatch in 16 days at 10 [degrees] C. Eggs and free-living stage III larvae of A. simplex and T. adunca are similar in morphology with little differentiation of internal structures. Examination of the stomach contents of pelagic fish infested with anisakids indicated that possible intermediate hosts of A. simplex are the euphausiid Nyctiphanes australis and the decapod Munida gregaria. Possible hosts of T. adunca and M. gregaria are {{a wide variety of}} smaller zooplanktonic groups, e. g. decapod larvae and copepods. Larvae of A. simplex were found in one of 8850 N. australis; larvae of T. adunca were found in 69 of 3999 chaetognaths (Sagitta spp.) a medusa and a decapod larva. These larvae are morphologically similar to Stage III larvae from teleosts. No anisakids were found in 3956 Euphausia spp., 1147 M. gregaria and 740 prawns. Twenty five T. adunca larvae and adults were found in 818 freshly eaten M. gregaria in teleost stomachs, indicating that this invertebrate may act as a paratenic and a definitive host. Experimental infection of N. australis and M. gregaria with stage II larvae of A. simplex and T. adunca was unsuccessful. The location of anisakid infestation in three pelagic teleost species, Thyrsites atun, Trachurus novaezelandiae and Trachurus declivis is described. A. simplex larvae are found mainly in the body cavity of all species, at the posterior end of the stomach, with less than one percent occurring in the musculature. Distribution of A. simplex larvae does not change with increasing size of the host or increasing total worm burden. Thyrsites atun have a higher proportion of larvae in the stomach wall (8 - 13 %) compared to <b>Trachurus</b> <b>spp.</b> (< 4 %). T. adunca larvae are found infrequently in the body cavity of all three species, on the pyloric caeca and in the stomach wall. Adults and larvae of T. adunca are found more commonly in the alimentary canal, indicating that these teleosts are more important as definitive hosts in the {{life cycle of}} this anisakid. P. decipiens larvae are found only in Thyrsites atun and occur mainly in the muscles (98. 5 %). No quantitative pathogenic effects of anisakid infestation on these teleosts hosts were detected. The main factors influencing the infestation of the three teleost species are age of the host, locality and season. Sex of the host and depth (over the continental shelf, 0 - 250 m) are not important. A. simplex infestation increased with age in all host species examined, and was higher in Trachurus declivis from the southern-most locality, suggesting the existence of at least two distinct populations of this species. Significant differences in infestation of Thyrsites atun with P. decipiens suggests that this anisakid may be more common in southern localities also. The infestation of Thyrsites atun by larval and adult T. adunca in the alimentary canal is most influenced by season and closely related to diet. Nematode samples were obtained from the marine mammals Arctocephalus forsteri, Kogia breviceps and Phocarctos hookeri. Adult A. simplex were recorded from A. forsteri (a new host record) and Kogia breviceps; preadults from Phocarctos hookeri. Adult P. decipiens were recorded from Phocarctos hookeri; preadults from Arctocephalus forsteri and K. breviceps. Other anisakids found were Anisakis physeteris (Baylis 1923), Contracaecum osculatum Rudolphi 1802 and Pseudoterranova kogiae (Johnston and Mawson 1939) Mosgovoi 1951. These records are all new for the New Zealand region except P. decipiens from P. hookeri and C. osculatum from Arctocephalus forsteri. A. simplex and C. osculatum were found associated with gastric ulcers in Arctocephalus forsteri...|$|E
40|$|Common {{dolphins}} (genus Delphinus) {{are poorly}} understood within New Zealand waters. Prior to this study, most {{information relating to}} the taxonomy, population structure, diet and pollutant loads of this genus relied upon untested assumptions. Furthermore, factors affecting the occurrence, demographics and habitat use of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf remained unknown. This lack of empirical data {{has resulted in the}} inadequate recognition and management of New Zealand Delphinus. Inappropriately classified by the New Zealand Threat Classification System, the anthropogenic impacts that affect this genus have clearly been overlooked. The present study examines behaviour of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf and details analyses undertaken on tissue samples collected from around New Zealand. Results detailed here challenge many of the untested assumptions about this genus within New Zealand waters. The taxonomy of New Zealand common dolphins was assessed using 92 samples analysed for 577 base pairs (bps) of the mtDNA control region (D-loop). New Zealand samples were compared with 177 published sequences from eight other populations from around the world. New Zealand Delphinus exhibited a high genetic variability, sharing haplotypes with both short- (D. delphis) and long-beaked (D. capensis) populations. Indeed, the New Zealand population showed significant genetic differentiation when compared with most other populations world-wide. Furthermore, intrapopulation analyses revealed significant genetic differentiation between Hauraki Gulf individuals and other common dolphins sampled within New Zealand waters. Results suggest habitat choice and site fidelity {{may play a role in}} shaping the fragmented population structure of New Zealand Delphinus. Data relating to the occurrence and demographics of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf region were collected during boat-based surveys between February 2002 and January 2005. In total, 719 independent encounters, involving one to > 300 common dolphins were recorded. Dolphin presence was significantly affected by month, latitude and depth. Group size varied significantly by month, season, depth, sea surface temperature (SST) and latitude, and was highly skewed towards smaller groups comprising fewer than 50 animals. Calves were observed throughout the year but were most prevalent in the austral summer months of December and January. Group composition was significantly affected by month, season, depth and SST. The yearround occurrence and social organisation of Delphinus in Hauraki Gulf waters suggest this region is an important nursery and potential calving area. The effects of diel, season, depth, sea surface temperature, and group size and composition on dolphin behaviour were investigated using activity budgets. Foraging and social were the most and least frequently observed behaviours, respectively. A correlation between group size and behaviour was evident, although behaviour did not vary with the composition of dolphin groups. Resting, milling and socialising animals were more frequently observed in smaller groups. Foraging behaviour was prevalent in both small and large groups, suggesting foraging plasticity exists within this population. Behaviour differed between single- and multi-species groups, with foraging more frequent in mixed-species aggregations, indicating the primary mechanism for association is likely prey-related. Stomach contents analysed for forty-two stranded and eleven commercially by-caught individuals collected from around North Island, New Zealand between 1997 and 2006, revealed arrow squid (Nototodarus spp.), jack mackerel (<b>Trachurus</b> <b>spp.)</b> and anchovy (Engraulis australis) as the most prevalent prey. Stranded individuals and dolphins bycaught within neritic waters fed on both neritic and oceanic prey. Moreover, a mixed prey composition was evident in the diet of common dolphins by-caught in oceanic waters, suggesting inshore/offshore movements of New Zealand Delphinus on a diel basis. Additionally, prey differences were also evident in the stomach contents of common dolphins sampled from within the Hauraki Gulf. Trace elements, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine (OC) pesticide levels were determined in five stranded and fourteen by-caught Delphinus sampled from around New Zealand between 1999 and 2005. Generally, levels of trace elements were low. However, concentrations of OC pesticides were similar in range to those previously reported for Hector’s (Cephalorhyncus hectori) and common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Organochlorine pesticides dieldrin, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), o,p’-DDT and p,p’-DDE were present at the highest concentrations. Markov chain models were used to assess the impact of tourism activities on Delphinus within the Hauraki Gulf. Foraging and resting bouts were significantly disrupted by boat interactions. Both the duration of bouts and the time spent in these two behavioural states decreased during boat interactions. Additionally, foraging dolphins took significantly longer to return to their initial behavioural state in the presence of a tour boat. Impacts identified are similar to those previously reported for the common bottlenose dolphin, a coastal species typically considered to be more susceptible to cumulative anthropogenic impacts. Data presented here reveal the nature and apparent susceptibility of New Zealand common dolphins to human-induced impacts, namely fisheries by-catch, pollution and tourism. This in conjunction with taxonomic uncertainty, lack of abundance estimates and the year-round use of inshore waters for feeding, clearly warrants immediate attention from managers. Furthermore, the current threat classification of New Zealand Delphinus should be reconsidered in light of population uncertainties, and in view of the susceptibly to human-induced impacts revealed by the present study...|$|E
