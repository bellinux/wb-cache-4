5|$|The {{movement}} to legalize birth control {{came to a}} gradual conclusion around the time Planned Parenthood was formed. In 1942, there were over 400 birth control organizations in America, contraception was fully embraced by <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>profession,</b> and the anti-contraception Comstock laws (which still remained on the books) were rarely enforced.|$|E
40|$|Throughout {{the early}} modern period {{midwives}} formed {{one of the most}} prominent of female occupational groups in Spain. It was the only branch of <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>professions</b> which allowed women total hegemony until the eighteenth century. The history of women's place in <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>professions</b> is one of their gradual exclusion, a process which has continued untel very recent times, and one which was no respecter of midwives. Indeed, a complex process of reorganization of <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>professions</b> was taking place in eighteenth-century Spain, which paved the way for, amongst other things, the transformation of the art of midwifery into a male-dominated activity, and the subordination of midwives, who were to become the assistants of obstetric specialist in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries...|$|R

5|$|During Qandil's boyhood, he {{borrowed}} and read books {{from a medical}} practice and a culture and sporting association in Tanta on a near weekly basis. He also learned field hockey there. Qandil {{was at the top}} of his class throughout his later school years and initially sought to enter <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>profession,</b> a typical career aspiration for students with high marks. His mother particularly encouraged him to become a doctor. Qandil simultaneously took an interest in writing, Arabic calligraphy and foreign languages.|$|E
40|$|Since its founding, <b>the</b> osteopathic <b>medical</b> <b>profession</b> hasproudly {{maintained}} {{that it is}} based on a philosophy of health and disease.

5|$|In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association listed {{homosexuality}} in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) as {{a mental}} disorder. A large-scale study of homosexuality in 1962 {{was used to}} justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear {{of the opposite sex}} caused by traumatic parent–child relationships. This view was widely influential in <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>profession.</b> In 1956, however, the psychologist Evelyn Hooker performed a study that compared the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference. Her study stunned the medical community and made her a hero to many gay men and lesbians, but homosexuality remained in the DSM until 1973.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} to gain an accurate picture of incidence and prevalence of self-harm. This is due in a part {{to a lack of}} sufficient numbers of dedicated research centres to provide a continuous monitoring system. However, even with sufficient resources, statistical estimates are crude since most incidences of self-harm are undisclosed to <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>profession</b> as acts of self-harm are frequently carried out in secret, and wounds may be superficial and easily treated by the individual. Recorded figures can be based on three sources: psychiatric samples, hospital admissions and general population surveys.|$|E

5|$|Legal {{victories}} in the 1930s continued to weaken anti-contraception laws. The court victories motivated the American Medical Association in 1937 to adopt contraception as a core component of medical school curricula, but the medical community was slow to accept this new responsibility, and women continued to rely on unsafe and ineffective contraceptive advice from ill-informed sources. In 1942, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America was formed, creating a nationwide network of birth control clinics. After World War II, the movement to legalize birth control came to a gradual conclusion, as birth control was fully embraced by <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>profession,</b> and the remaining anti-contraception laws were no longer enforced.|$|E
5|$|Like {{those in}} the police force, many in <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>profession</b> were {{reluctant}} {{to abide by the}} new laws. From September 30, gun applicants had to hand in a medical health evaluation (certifying that they were mentally sound enough to bear arms), carried out by a doctor, to gain access to a weapon. The Finnish Medical Association opposed this on the grounds that doctors were already overburdened with work, and Basic Services Minister Paula Risikko suggested that more medical workers could be employed by police departments instead.|$|E
5|$|Many long-time {{employees}} of Olympus Corp were shocked and angry, and felt {{betrayed by the}} executives who were responsible for bringing public humiliation onto the company. Former director Koji Miyata started a web site, called Olympus Grassroots, demanding clean-up at the company they say they love. Miyata also circulated a petition targeted at employees calling on the reinstatement of Woodford. As Olympus has a 70-percent market share in endoscopy, the scandal caused anxiety and concern among <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>profession,</b> which sees Olympus endoscopes as irreplaceable.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>the</b> {{idea that}} <b>medical</b> <b>professions</b> in <b>the</b> United Kingdom have, {{as a result}} of restrictive practices of various kinds, managed to obtain rates of return to their education and training well above those achieved in other professions. It concludes that after making various adjustments, in particular allowing for differences in hours worked, the returns obtained are in most cases not very different from those for other professions. With the exception of dentists there is therefore no clear-cut evidence from earnings data alone of restrictive practices in <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>professions...</b>|$|R

5|$|Sanger appealed her 1917 {{conviction}} {{and won a}} mixed victory in 1918 in a unanimous decision by the New York Court of Appeals written by Judge Frederick E. Crane. The court's opinion upheld her conviction, but indicated that the courts {{would be willing to}} permit contraception if prescribed by doctors.Engelman, pp. 101–103. This decision was only applicable within New York, where it opened the door for birth control clinics, under physician supervision, to be established. Sanger herself did not immediately take advantage of the opportunity, wrongly expecting that <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>profession</b> would lead the way; instead she focused on writing and lecturing.|$|E
5|$|Under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), {{students}} and their educational employers are exempted from paying Social Security taxes. The Treasury Department issued a regulation in 2004, declaring those who worked more than 40 hours a week were ineligible for such an exemption. The Mayo Foundation filed suit to challenge the regulation and for a refund of the taxes it had paid on its medical residents—recently graduated physicians who work more than full-time providing patient care, but who are still considered trainees by <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>profession.</b> The District Court ruled for the Mayo Foundation and struck the regulation, but was reversed by the Court of Appeals.|$|E
5|$|The Sisters faced {{controversy}} {{not only}} from public opinion, but also within <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>profession.</b> Initially the response of Montreal doctors was positive, and in 1850 the College of Physicians petitioned Bishop Bourget for permission to send students to the Hospice de Sainte-Pélagie for training, which Bourget granted {{over the objections of}} the Sisters. However, friction arose between the Sisters and the students; the Sisters did not want the students present (a position shared by many of the unwed mothers), while the students were often contemptuous, rude, or dismissive towards their patients. Combined with the competency of the Misericorde Sisters, and their non-profit mandate, this friction bloomed into hostility between the Sisters and Montreal physicians, who came to see the midwives as a professional threat.|$|E

5|$|The first {{successful}} heart transplantation {{was performed in}} 1967 by the South African surgeon Christiaan Barnard at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town. This marked an important milestone in cardiac surgery, capturing the attention of both <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>profession</b> and the world at large. However, long-term survival rates of patients were initially very low. Louis Washkansky, the first recipient of a donated heart, died 18 days after the operation while other patients did not survive {{for more than a}} few weeks. The American surgeon Norman Shumway has been credited for his efforts to improve transplantation techniques, along with pioneers Richard Lower, Vladimir Demikhov and Adrian Kantrowitz. As of March 2000, more than 55,000 heart transplantations have been performed worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The {{obligation}} {{of a professional}} medical care provider to alleviate suffering may occasionally come into conflict with the obligation to prolong life. If a terminally ill person prefers to be painless, despite {{a high level of}} sedation and a risk of shortening their life, they should be provided with their desired pain relief (despite the cost of sedation and a possibly slightly shorter life). Where a person is unable to be involved in this type of decision, the law and <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>profession</b> in the United Kingdom allow the doctor to assume that the person would prefer to be painless, and thus the provider may prescribe and administer adequate analgesia, even if the treatment may slightly hasten death. It is taken that the underlying cause of death in this case is the illness and not the necessary pain management.|$|E
