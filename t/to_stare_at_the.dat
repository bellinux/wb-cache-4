5|$|To {{properly}} {{tell the}} international {{aspects of the}} story, filming for Sense8 took place almost entirely on location around the globe. In the first season they filmed in nine cities located in eight countries: Berlin, Chicago, London, Mexico City, Mumbai, Nairobi, Reykjavík, San Francisco, and Seoul. Production on the first season began on June 18, 2014 in San Francisco. The filmmakers successfully negotiated with {{the organizers of the}} Clarion Alley Mural Project and select artists to feature their artwork in the show. Shooting in Chicago began on July 9 and wrapped up on August 8, with filming taking place both on location and at the Cinespace Film Studios. They shot some scenes in the Superdawg drive-through restaurant, while customers were being asked not <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> filming. Lana and Lilly Wachowski are frequent customers of the place. During location scouting, the producers found the City Methodist Church in Gary, Indiana which is nearby Chicago, and changed one site's description in the scripts to a church accordingly in order to fit that particular site into the filming. They filmed in the church from July 25 to 28. Filming proceeded to London for a short shoot and then to Iceland, where between August 26 and September 6 they shot in Reykjavik and nearby places such as Akranes. Filming then started in Nairobi, where a sequence required a crowd of 700 extras, 200 cars and a helicopter. In Seoul they filmed from September 18 to 30. Next they moved to Mexico City and later to Germany, where they filmed in Berlin and inside Babelsberg Studio. Last place they visited was Mumbai where they also shot a Bollywood dance number that was choreographed by Slumdog Millionaires Longinus Fernandes. The writers wanted to feature an event in each city. They were able to schedule the Pride scenes with its Dykes on Bikes on the Dyke March in San Francisco, the Fourth of July fireworks celebration in Chicago, and the Ganesha Chaturthi Hindu festival in Mumbai. Additionally they recorded footage from the Fresh Meat Festival of transgender and queer performance in San Francisco, a club event taking place at the KOKO in London, and a real lucha libre (Mexican professional wrestling) event with the fighters wearing wrestling masks in Arena Naucalpan, in Mexico City. Lastly the scenes where characters are flying on an airplane were recorded during the real flights the cast and crew had to do to get from London to Iceland. On November 17, 2014 Straczynski wrote that the main unit shooting had wrapped, with only a few winter shots in Iceland remaining to be captured the next month. These scenes were further delayed to mid-January 2015, until Iceland had the necessary amount of snow, with the wrap party taking place in Reykjavík's Harpa Music and Concert hall on January 21. By the end of the shooting, the filmmakers had completed 100,000 miles of flight time, or four times around the globe.|$|E
500|$|During {{the siege}} of the Stonewall, Craig Rodwell called The New York Times, the New York Post, and the Daily News to inform them what was happening. All three papers covered the riots; the Daily News placed {{coverage}} on the front page. News of the riot spread quickly throughout Greenwich Village, fueled by rumors {{that it had been}} organized by the Students for a Democratic Society, the Black Panthers, or triggered by [...] "a homosexual police officer whose roommate went dancing at the Stonewall against the officer's wishes". All day Saturday, June 28, people came <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> burned and blackened Stonewall Inn. Graffiti appeared {{on the walls of the}} bar, declaring [...] "Drag power", [...] "They invaded our rights", [...] "Support gay power", and [...] "Legalize gay bars", along with accusations of police looting, and—regarding the status of the bar—"We are open." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the last}} {{scene of the}} episode, Bart is seen writing [...] "I will not expose the ignorance of the faculty" [...] on the {{blackboard}} as a punishment for exposing the ignorance of the teachers by removing the Teachers' Editions. In his book The Small Screen: How Television Equips Us to Live in the Information Age, Brian L. Ott describes this scene {{as one of the}} [...] "key ways The Simpsons appeals to audience, which tends to be younger, by critiquing authority figures, and in particular educators." [...] Toby Daspit and John Weaver write in their book Popular Culture and Critical Pedagogy: Reading, Constructing, Connecting that the writers of The Simpsons are [...] "particularly interested" [...] in questions about authority and the abuses of powers in school. Another scene from the episode sees Ms. Hoover telling the students <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> blackboard for fifteen minutes until class is over. Daspit and Weaver write that it is [...] "the absolute power that teachers have over students' every action that allows for the image to be presented on The Simpsons. It would be comforting to tell ourselves that this is simply parody run amok, that the writers are stretching reality to make a point, but the discussants in the study [...] had memories of a reality very much like the one presented in this program." [...] One of the discussants said she believes everyone has experienced similar situations in their school years, and she thinks the thought that [...] "an educator could ever do something so useless and pointless with the children's time" [...] is [...] "frightening".|$|E

2500|$|The {{fennec fox}} is an omnivore. Food sources include plants, rodents, insects, birds, eggs, and rabbits. An {{individual}} can jump up to [...] high and [...] forward, which helps it catch prey and escape predators. When hunting, large eared foxes {{such as the}} fennec, or the bat-eared fox, can seem <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ground while they rotate their heads {{from side to side}} to pinpoint the location of prey, either underground or hidden above ground. There are reports that fennec foxes climb date palms while foraging for fruit; however, some experts consider these reports unlikely unless low branches are available for support.|$|E

2500|$|Tuchman {{also notes}} his use {{in his letters}} and diaries of a {{catalogue}} of now insulting words which she says [...] "he used easily and seemingly without pejorative content": these included [...] "limeys for the English, frogs for the French ("met a frog and his wife on shipboard"), huns and squareheads for Germans, wops for Italians, chinks or chinos for Chinese, googs for Filipinos, niggers or coons for Negroes", while {{at the end of}} the war Tuchman says he took [...] "a harsh pleasure in touring the gutted and burned-out districts of Yokohama and staring at the once arrogant [...] now living in shanties of scrap lumber and tin and scratching in the dirt to plant onions". His diary entry for 1 September 1945 (in Yokohama) reads in part: [...] "What a kick <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> arrogant, ugly, moon-faced, buck-toothed, bowlegged bastards, and realize where this puts them. Many newly demobilized soldiers around. Most police salute. People generally just apathetic. We gloated over the destruction & came in at 3:00 feeling fine." ...|$|E
2500|$|Others, such as {{professor}} of physics Auguste Meessen, suggest that optical effects created by the human eye can account for the reported phenomenon. Meessen presented his analysis of apparitions and [...] "miracles of the sun" [...] at the International Symposium [...] "Science, Religion and Conscience" [...] in 2003. While Meessen felt those who claim to have experienced miracles were [...] "honestly experiencing what they report", he stated sun miracles cannot be taken at face value and that the reported observations were optical effects caused by prolonged staring at the sun. Meessen contends that retinal after-images produced after brief periods of sun gazing are a likely cause of the observed dancing effects. Similarly, Meessen concluded that the color changes witnessed were most likely caused by the bleaching of photosensitive retinal cells. Meessen observes that Sun Miracles have been witnessed in many places where religiously charged pilgrims have been encouraged <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sun. He cites the apparitions at Heroldsbach, Germany (1949) as an example, where many people within a crowd of over 10,000 testified to witnessing similar observations as at Fátima. Meessen also cites a British Journal of Ophthalmology article that discusses some modern examples of Sun Miracles. Prof. Dr. Stöckl, a meteorologist from Regensburg, also proposed a similar theory and made similar observations.|$|E
