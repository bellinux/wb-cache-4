5|$|On 7 August 1942, Allied forces (primarily U.S. Marines) {{landed on}} Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands.

5|$|Rhinocyllus conicus, a seed-feeding weevil, was {{introduced}} to North America to control exotic musk thistle (Carduus nutans) and Canadian thistle (Cirsium arvense).

5|$|Unlike most {{religions}} in the Roman Empire, however, Christianity required its adherents {{to renounce}} all other gods, a practice adopted from Judaism (see Idolatry). The Christians' refusal to join pagan celebrations meant {{they were unable}} to participate in much of public life, which caused non-Christians—including government authorities—to fear that the Christians were angering the gods and thereby <b>threatening</b> <b>the</b> peace and prosperity of the Empire. The resulting persecutions were a defining feature of Christian self-understanding until Christianity was legalised in the 4th century.|$|E
5|$|Another {{threat to}} {{albatrosses}} is introduced species, such as rats or feral cats, which directly attack albatrosses or their chicks and eggs. Albatrosses {{have evolved to}} breed on islands where land mammals are absent and have not developed defences against them. Even species as small as mice can be detrimental; on Gough Island the chicks of Tristan albatrosses are attacked and eaten alive by introduced house mice. Introduced species can have other indirect effects: cattle overgrazed essential cover on Amsterdam Island, <b>threatening</b> <b>the</b> Amsterdam albatross; on other islands introduced plants reduce potential nesting habitat.|$|E
5|$|Aratus sent an embassy to Antigonus III in 226BC {{seeking an}} {{unexpected}} alliance {{now that the}} reformist king Cleomenes III of Sparta was <b>threatening</b> <b>the</b> rest of Greece in the Cleomenean War (229–222BC). In exchange for military aid, AntigonusIII demanded the return of Corinth to Macedonian control, which Aratus finally agreed to in 225BC. In 224BC, AntigonusIII's forces took Arcadia from Sparta. After forming a Hellenic league {{in the same vein}} as PhilipII's League of Corinth, he managed to defeat Sparta at the Battle of Sellasia in 222BC. Sparta was occupied by a foreign power {{for the first time in}} its history, restoring Macedonia's position as the leading power in Greece. Antigonus died a year later, perhaps from tuberculosis, leaving behind a strong Hellenistic kingdom for his successor PhilipV.|$|E
