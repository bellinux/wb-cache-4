50|$|<b>Tylosin</b> {{has been}} used to treat a variety of {{different}} diseases throughout the world. Differing formulations and licensing conditions mean {{it may not be a}} recognized method of treatment for certain conditions in certain countries. In general, <b>tylosin</b> is licensed for the treatment of infections caused by organisms susceptible to the drug, but it has also been used as a treatment of colitis in small animals, as a growth promotant in food-producing animals, and as a way of reducing epiphora (tear staining) around the eyes of white-faced dogs. In these cases, the result is positive only when using the <b>tylosin</b> in the form of tartrate, a chelating porphyrin. No marketing authority exists for the use of other <b>tylosin</b> forms as a tear-stain remover, thus it is not legal to use it for such purposes; the exception is as a prescription-only medicine of last resort by veterinarians under the cascading rule (UK) or the extra-label use rule (US).|$|E
50|$|The {{injectable}} {{formulations of}} <b>tylosin</b> can cause pain, inflammation, and itchiness around the injection site.|$|E
50|$|Antibiotics are {{effective}} at treating and preventing the disease, especially <b>Tylosin</b> but also Lincomycin and Spectinomycin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tylosin</b> is {{available}} in injectable, intramammary, and oral formulations with different product ranges available in different countries.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tylosin</b> may {{increase}} digitalis blood levels, thus its toxicity, {{and may be}} antagonistic to chloramphenicol or lincosamides.|$|E

50|$|Like other macrolides, <b>tylosin</b> has a {{bacteriostatic}} {{effect on}} susceptible organisms, caused by inhibition of protein synthesis through binding to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>tylosin</b> has a {{relatively}} poor {{spectrum of activity}} against Gram-negative organisms, {{it may not be}} a sensible therapeutic choice in the treatment of infections caused by unknown, potentially unsusceptible organisms.|$|E

50|$|Wildlife rehabilitators {{should be}} careful to not misdiagnose M. gallisepticum {{infection}} with other diseases with similar clinical signs, such as avian influenza, chlamydiosis, Newcastle disease, infectious bronchitis, head trauma, and avian pox virus. M. gallisepticum can be treated with antibiotics such as <b>tylosin,</b> tetracycline, or oral enrofloxacin with ophthalmic gentamicin. These are given through food, water or injections. Especially <b>tylosin</b> gives good results in the feed. However, treated birds must be kept in captivity and isolation {{for a long time}} period because birds may become asymptomatic carriers. At this point, {{it is very difficult to}} verify if previously infected birds are still infected with M. gallisepticum. Treatment and release is not wise for disease control in wild populations.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tylosin</b> {{is used in}} {{veterinary}} medicine to treat bacterial infections {{in a wide range}} of species and has a high margin of safety. It has also been used as a growth promotant in some species, and as a treatment for colitis in companion animals.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tylosin</b> is an {{antibiotic}} and a bacteriostatic feed additive used in veterinary medicine.

50|$|A. pleuropneumoniae {{was found}} to be the causative agent for up to 20% of all {{bacterial}} pneumonia cases in swine. The main disease associated with this bacterium is porcine pleuropneumonia, a highly contagious respiratory disease, affecting primarily young pigs (usually less than 6 months). All of the symptoms and signs of porcine pleuropneumonia can be attributed to its virulence factors. The symptoms include respiratory distress, bloodstained discharge (usually frothy) from the mouth, fever, anorexia, mild diarrhea, cyanosis, lethargy, and spontaneous abortion in sows. The most common sign for a pig farmer is the sudden death of several pigs over a short period of time. Peak mortality is usually reached when pigs are 10-16 weeks old. It is not uncommon for mortality rates to reach 20-80% in fattening pigs, with similarly high morbidity. Pigs that do survive the disease remain as carriers and spread the bacterium to other swine. Several bacterial combinations are seen in vivo, the most common simultaneous infection being Pasteurella multocida. Treatment must be immediate and continuous. Antibiotics used include ceftiofur, tetracycline, synthetic penicillins, <b>tylosin,</b> and sulfonamides.|$|E

30|$|<b>Tylosin</b> {{tartrate}} {{belongs to}} the macrolide antibiotics and acts by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis [14, 15]. <b>Tylosin</b> is composed of four bioactive forms, <b>tylosin</b> A, B, C, and D, with <b>tylosin</b> A having the greatest share (80 – 90  %) and having the greatest activity [14, 16].

40|$|<b>Tylosin</b> is {{a widely}} used {{macrolide}} antibiotic for therapeutics and growth promotion in swine, beef cattle, and poultry production. Through various routes such as manure application, emission, inappropriate disposal, etc., <b>tylosin</b> enters the environment. The fate of <b>tylosin</b> in the environment is not yet fully understood. In this study, two photoreaction products of <b>tylosin</b> in water were identified as isotylosin A alcohol (E,Z) and isotylosin A aldol (E,Z). <b>Tylosin</b> A, B, C, D, isotylosin A alcohol, and isotylosin A aldol were purified, and immunological cross-reactivities of these tylosin-related compounds were tested with a specificity of 26 % for <b>tylosin</b> B, 19 % for <b>tylosin</b> C, 106 % for <b>tylosin</b> D, 121 % for isotylosin A alcohol, and 46 % for isotylosin A aldol, compared to 100 % for <b>tylosin</b> A. Competitive direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for <b>tylosin</b> detection in water was compared with a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method by analyzing the same water samples from a study of <b>tylosin</b> dissipation in water.

40|$|Aerobic degradation, photolysis, and {{mobility}} of <b>tylosin</b> were investigated in the laboratory. <b>Tylosin</b> A is degraded with a half-life of 200 d in water, {{while it is}} stable in the dark. <b>Tylosin</b> C and D are relatively stable except in ultrapure water in the light. Slight increases of <b>tylosin</b> B and formation of two photoreaction products, isotylosin A alcohol (E,Z) and isotylosin A aldol (E,Z), were observed under exposure to light. In soil <b>tylosin</b> A and D has a dissipation half-life of about 1 wk. Sorption and abiotic degradation are the major factors influencing the loss of <b>tylosin</b> in the environment. No biotic degradation was observed at the test concentration of 50 µg/ml or µg/g either in pond water or in an agronomic soil, as determined by comparing dissipation profiles in sterilized and unsterilized conditions. At 7. 5 ng/ml, biotransformation may {{play an important role}} in degradation of <b>tylosin</b> in water. <b>Tylosin</b> has strong sorption to various soils, and leachbility is dependent on soil properties and manure amendment.

30|$|Given a (calculated) log Kow of 2.5, the unspecific binding of the {{uncharged}} <b>tylosin</b> molecule {{to organic}} carbon should be moderate [22]. The pKa of <b>tylosin</b> is around 7.7 {{so that in}} manure with a basic pH the substance is present both as the positively charged cation and the uncharged molecule [23]. With decreasing pH, the degree of protonation and the binding to negatively charged matrices such as manure and soil increases [23, 24]. Yet, Loke et al. [23] found that instead of ionic binding sorption of <b>tylosin</b> (precisely <b>tylosin</b> A) in manure is mainly caused by hydrophobic interactions with organic matter. Apparently, sorption can substantially delay degradation of <b>tylosin.</b> In spiked manure, residual <b>tylosin</b> was detected after 8 months of incubation [21]. Similarly, a prolonged half-life for <b>tylosin</b> A of 49  days was determined in a sandy field soil [22] and of 95 and 97  days in a sandy loam and a clay loam, respectively [25]. Hence, despite its biodegradability, <b>tylosin</b> can be persistent in field soils where dissipation may be much slower than under laboratory conditions.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{are reported in}} which the effect of <b>tylosin</b> upon the development of Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) infection in replacement layers was monitored by serological and cultural methods. Concentrations of <b>tylosin</b> tested included 0, 22, 38. 5, and 55 ppm. Egg pro-duction and feed consumption data were collected for one year. <b>Tylosin</b> slowed the rate of spread of MG infection as measured by serological and cultural meth-ods. The effect of <b>tylosin</b> on the spread of MG infection was dose related. Hen day egg production peaked at 85 to 87 % in the medicated groups, while controls peaked at 81 to 84 %. The magnitude of <b>tylosin</b> effect on production increased with time to a maximum difference of 10 to 12 % at 52 weeks. Feed efficiency was markedly improved by all concentrations of <b>tylosin</b> ranging from 5 % at peak production to 12 to 18 % at 52 weeks.

40|$|The {{depletion}} of <b>tylosin</b> residues in edible turkey tissues was followed after 3 days of administration of <b>tylosin</b> tartrate at 500 mg l- 1 in drinking water, to 30 turkeys. Immediately {{after the end}} of the treatment (day 0) and at day 1, 3, 5 and 10 of withdrawal, six turkeys (three males and three females) per time were sacrificed and samples of edible tissues were collected. Tissue homogenates were extracted, purified and analysed by HPLC according to a method previously published for the analysis of <b>tylosin</b> residues in pig tissues. In all tissues, <b>tylosin</b> residues were already below the detection limits of 50 micrograms kg- 1 at time zero. However, in several samples of tissues (skin + fat, liver, kidney, muscle), from the six turkeys sacrificed at that time, one peak corresponding to an unknown <b>tylosin</b> equivalent was detected at measurable concentrations. The identification of this unknown compound was performed by LC-MS/MS analysis of the extracts from incurred samples. The mass fragmentation of the compound was consistent with the structure of <b>tylosin</b> D (the alcoholic derivative of <b>tylosin</b> A), the major metabolite of <b>tylosin</b> previously recovered and identified in tissues and/or excreta from treated chickens, cattle and pigs...|$|E
