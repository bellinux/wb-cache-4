2500|$|Machine-woven carpets like Axminster and Wilton {{are made}} by massive looms that weave {{together}} ‘bobbins’ of carpet yarn and backing. The finished result, which can be intricately patterned, creates a floor that provides supreme underfoot luxury with high performance. Tufted carpets are also popular in the home. They are relatively speedy to make - a pre-woven backing has yarns tufted into it. Needles push the yarn through the backing and which is then held in place with underlying [...] "loopers". Tufted carpets can be <b>twist</b> <b>pile,</b> velvet, or loop pile. <b>Twist</b> <b>pile</b> carpets are produced when one or more fibres are twisted in the tufting process, {{so that in the}} finished carpet they appear to be bound together. Velvet pile carpets tend to have a shorter pile and a tighter construction, giving the finished article a smooth, velvety appearance. Loop pile carpets are renowned for being hard wearing and lend carpets great texture. The traditional domain of rugs from far away continents, hand knotted squares and rugs use the expertise of weavers to produce work of the finest quality. Traditional rugs often feature a deliberate ‘mistake’ on behalf of the weaver to guarantee their authenticity.|$|E

40|$|Torsional loads on pile {{foundations}} are induced {{by the action of}} eccentric horizontal forces on the supporting structures. Such loading not only initiates <b>twisting</b> at the <b>pile</b> head but also reduces its axial capacity significantly with increased settlement of the foundation. Several theoretical and experimental investigations have already been carried out on piles under torsional load, as evidenced by the available literature on the subject, although contributions on the influence of combined torsional and axial loads on {{pile foundations}} are rather limited. This paper presents a novel numerical model (boundary-element method) to analyze the response of a single vertical floating pile subjected to simultaneous torsional and axial loads. The nonlinear stress-strain response of soil has been incorporated in the model by means of the hyperbolic model, whereas the pile material has been idealized as elastic-perfectly plastic. The effect of progressive pile-soil slippage at the interface is considered. Apart from predicting the load-displacement response and incremental angle of <b>twist</b> of <b>piles</b> under combined torsional and axial loading, the shear-stress profiles and the effect of vertical loads on the torsional capacity of the piles are some of the salient features captured by the proposed model. Validation of the proposed model by means of a comparison with existing models and experimental data indicates the suitability and accuracy of the solutions developed. The proposed model is also applied successfully to selected case studies on piles in clay, sand, and layered soil, and important conclusions are drawn...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- In {{the present}} study, the torque-twist {{behavior}} of non-linear pile-soil system {{related to the}} wave-current loading on Jacket type offshore platform is investigated. The non-linearities of pile-soil with respect to both depth and the <b>twist</b> angle of <b>pile</b> are considered. The basic differential equilibrium equations of the pile-soil system are derived based on hyper- elasticity theory of soil. A numerical central finite difference method is applied based on simplification of stress field around the pile elements which takes into account changes in the seco nd a r y shear stress components and also non-linearities due to non-homogeneous soil condition. This method uses a one-dimensional mesh along pile-soil interface. It also {{takes into account the}} changes in G of soil with respect to the <b>twist</b> angle of <b>pile.</b> In a separate work, the simulated torque-twist behavior of pile-soil system based on this analysis approach is compared with the results of more refined finite element analysis by using continuum mechanics theory and also full scale pile-soil test results (Emami, 2002). The torque-twist results by using the proposed approach have been used to study the behavior of two jacket-pile-soil systems under sea environmental and accidental loading...|$|R
50|$|The {{crafting}} process incorporates {{three basic}} stages: spinning, weaving, and embellishing. Using a hand spindle, a weaver spins coton, camelid fiber, or sheep's wool into a thread and then <b>twists</b> or <b>piles</b> {{two or more}} spun threads together to strengthen the yarn. When she has spun and piled enough yarn, the weaver turns to her loom. Horizontal ground looms are particularly common in the southern Andes, {{where most of the}} chuspas are made. Once the weaver has wraped the loom by continuously wrapping a length of yarn in a figure-eight around the bars {{at each end of the}} loom, she can begin to interlace the weft threads into the warp to create a structure. Although plain weave is the simplest and most common, weavers use a range of more complex weaving techniques in order to achieve the elaborate designs seen in chuspas and other Andean cloth.|$|R
40|$|Torsional load on pile {{foundations}} is induced {{by the action of}} eccentric horizontal forces on the supporting structures. Such loading not only initiates <b>twist</b> at the <b>pile</b> head, but also reduces its axial capacity significantly associated with increased settlement of the foundation. Inadequate design of piles under torsion may lead to disastrous consequences. Although several theoretical and experimental investigations have already been carried out on piles under torsional load as evidenced from the available literature, there is ample scope for further contributions on the influence of torsional load on pile foundation. This paper presents a novel numerical model (boundary element method) to analyze the response of a single, vertical, floating pile subjected to pure torsional load. The nonlinear stress-strain response of soil has been incorporated in the model by hyperbolic correlation, whereas the pile material has been idealized as elastic-perfectly plastic. The effect of progressive pile-soil slippage at the interface is considered. Apart from predicting the load-displacement response with incremental angle of <b>twist</b> of <b>pile</b> under pure torsion, the profiles for shear stress and angle of twist and the depth of interface slippage are some of the salient features captured by the proposed model. Validation of the model developed by comparing with existing models and experimental data indicate the suitability and accuracy of the solutions developed. However, minor discrepancies in the solution appeared owing to the simplified assumptions of perfectly plastic postpeak soil behavior and the absence of residual stress in the soil owing to pile installation. The proposed model is also applied successfully to selected case studies on concrete piles (L=D ranged from 10 - 40) in medium-soft clay, medium-dense sand, and layered soil, and a set of design curves have been constructed. 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{uncertainties}} {{in the design of}} offshore wind turbines is the prediction of long term performance of the foundation i. e. the effect of millions of cycles of cyclic and dynamic loads on the foundation. This technical note presents a simple and easily scalable loading device that is able to apply millions of cycles of cyclic as well as dynamic loading to a scaled model to evaluate the long term performance. Furthermore, the device is economic and is able to replicate complex waveforms (in terms of frequency and amplitude) and also study the wind and wave misalignment aspects. The proposed test methodology may also suffice the requirements of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Level 3 – 4 i. e. Experimental Proof of Concept validation as described by European Commission. Typical long term test results from two types of foundations (monopile and <b>twisted</b> jacket on <b>piles)</b> are presented to show the effectiveness of the loading device...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{reports a}} series of {{centrifuge}} model tests on torsionally loaded 12, 22, and 33 pile groups in sand. The objectives of the paper are to investigate: 1 {{the response of the}} pile groups subjected to torsion; 2 {{the way in which the}} applied torque is transferred in the pile groups; 3 the internal forces mobilized in these torsionally loaded pile groups and their contributions to resist the applied torque; and 4 the influence factors that affect the load transfer, such as soil density and pile-cap connection. In these model tests, the group torsional resistances of the pile groups increased monotonically in the test range of twist angles up to 8 °. Both torsional and lateral resistances of the individual piles were simultaneously mobilized to resist the applied torque. The torsional resistances were substantially mobilized at small twist angles, while the lateral resistances kept increasing in the whole range of twist angles. Thus, the contribution of the torsional resistances to the applied torque decreased at large <b>twist</b> angles. The <b>piles</b> at different locations in a pile group could develop not only different horizontal displacements, but also different pile–soil–pile interactions and load–deformation coupling effect, hence, the torsional and lateral resistances of the piles are a function of pile location. The soil density had a more significant effect on the torsional resistances than on the lateral resistances of the group piles...|$|R
