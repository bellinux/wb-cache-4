5|$|By {{the end of}} 1957, US131 {{had been}} realigned as an {{expressway}} from the Three Rivers bypass to Moorepark. The section of freeway in the Grand Rapids area opened near the southern county line north to 28th Street. This latter freeway segment was extended further south to Wayland {{by the middle of}} 1958. By the middle of 1960, the freeway was extended to M-118 in Martin, where traffic used M-118 to connect back to the old routing. The southern end of US131 was moved to another location on <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>line.</b> Instead of running concurrently with US112 between White Pigeon and Mottville, US131 ran directly south of White Pigeon to <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>line.</b> In the process, the M-103 designation was swapped with US131.|$|E

5|$|M-125 {{starts at}} <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>line</b> as the {{continuation}} of Detroit Avenue running northward from Toledo. Once across <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>line,</b> the roadway takes on the Dixie Highway name and passes a residential subdivision. The highway runs north-northeasterly roughly parallel with, and between, both US24 and I-75 through farm land in rural Monroe County. The trunkline passes through the community of Erie before intersecting with Conn. M-125 (Summit Street) north of town. That unsigned connector is a state highway that links M-125 with I-75 to the south. Continuing north, M-125 intersects Luna Pier Road, which to the west is the unsigned Conn.

5|$|M-73 {{starts on}} its southwestern end on a {{bridge over the}} Brule River that connects across <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>line</b> to WIS55 in Forest County, Wisconsin. On the Michigan side of the border, the highway runs north away from the river. It runs along {{the western edge of}} a section of farm fields before turning eastward to run through them. M-73 passes to the south of Hagerman, Little Hagerman and Bass lakes, after which it turns northeasterly running north of Stanley Lake. The {{northern}} terminus is at US2 west of downtown Iron River. All of M-73 is two-lane rural highway through wooded terrain except the section immediately north of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>line</b> which runs along the aforementioned farm.|$|E

5|$|Route 108 was {{designated}} in 1930, connecting from <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>line</b> to Route 25. The road was already paved in gravel. Three years later, Route Y {{was designated}}, and it connected from Route 108 in Arbyth to Caruth. In 1936, Route 108 was repaved in concrete. By 1953, Route 25 was rerouted into Arbyrd, becoming the terminus of Routes 108 and Y there. Route 164 was designated in 1956, replacing a large section of Route Y from Route 108 to Route N. Fifteen years later, Route 25 was rerouted to the west, {{and the old}} alignment, from Route 246, through Arbyrd, became part of Route 108. Around 1983, US 412 was designated, replacing Route 25 from Kennett to <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{western end}} of US2 took on two changes in the 1940s. M‑28 was {{extended}} along US2 to <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>line</b> at Ironwood from its western terminus at Wakefield. A similar extension was made from M‑28's eastern terminus to Sault Ste. Marie in 1948. The M‑54 designation was renumbered as Business US2 by 1945.

5|$|Two other roads {{have been}} {{numbered}} Utah SR-58 in the past. The first route designated SR-58 {{was formed in}} 1945 between SR-36 and Clover, but was ed in 1953. The second road to use the designation was formed in 1965 between I-15 in New Harmony back to I-15 via Kanarraville, but that road was decommissioned in 1969. The current SR-58 was codified into Utah law in 1969 between <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>line</b> and the junction with Frontage Road, which was formerly US40. Wendover Boulevard between US93Alt. and <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>line</b> was designated SR224 between July 1, 1976, and April 28, 1993, when the highway was transferred to Elko County.|$|E
5|$|By 1920, {{what is now}} Route 54 in Delaware existed as an unpaved county road. The {{portion of}} the current route along Millsboro Highway was {{proposed}} as a state highway by 1925. This segment of state highway was completed by 1931, along with the portions from south of Columbia to a point along <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>line</b> {{to the east of}} Delmar and between Selbyville and Williamsville. A portion of the route along <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>line</b> east of Delmar was paved as a county road. On July 1, 1935, the county-maintained portions of the road in Delaware were taken over by the state. By 1936, the roadway was paved between Williamsville and Fenwick Island. A portion of road to the west of Selbyville was paved by 1939. By 1942, the remainder of the road in Delaware between the Maryland border and south of Columbia and Gumboro and Selbyville were paved.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, when Wisconsin {{initially}} numbered its highway system, {{the route}} of what later became US141 followed two separate state highways: WIS17 from downtown Milwaukee to Manitowoc and WIS16 from Manitowoc north to Green Bay. Segments that later became US141 in Wisconsin were numbered WIS15 between Green Bay and Abrams, and WIS38 between Abrams and Wausaukee. North of Wausaukee, the future US Highway was an unnumbered secondary highway. In 1919, Michigan signed its highway system, but the state {{did not have a}} highway running south from Quinnesec to <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>line.</b> The highway from Quinnesec into Iron Mountain was part of M-12. The segment through Florence County, Wisconsin, was WIS69, and from the Crystal Falls area north to Covington, the M-69 moniker was used. In 1919, the WIS38 designation was extended northward to Niagara and <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>line.</b> The highway was straightened to eliminate a series of sharp curves between Crivitz and Beaver in 1921. The same year, WIS17 was realigned between Sheboygan and Cedar Grove to run via Oostburg. WIS17 was also realigned in 1922 to follow a separate routing south of Port Washington; previously it was routed concurrently with WIS57 in the area. By 1924, maps showed an unnumbered roadway running south from Quinnesec to connect with WIS57 at <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

5|$|M-189 is a north–south state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the Upper Peninsula of the US state of Michigan.
