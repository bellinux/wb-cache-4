The transit authority cited continued low ridership, as on average nine passengers a day boarded the train at Great Notch. On December 21, 2009, New Jersey Transit announced the closure stating that the [...] "anemic" [...] ridership had remained at Great Notch, with only an average of 9 boardings a day, compared to 203 at the local Little Falls station and 597 at the Montclair State University Station. The last train to depart Great Notch was the 6:51pm train from Hoboken Terminal on January 15 leaving Great Notch at 7:41pm, as weekend trains do not run on this portion of the Montclair-Boonton Line.|$|R

40|$|In October of 1986, {{representatives of}} the VIA Metropolitan <b>Transit</b> System <b>contacted</b> the Center for Archaeological Research prior to {{construction}} on their bus parking lot that occupies the area above {{a section of the}} historic San Pedro Acequia. It was decided at that time that limited testing to define and locate the extent of the acequia remaining and determine if monitoring of further operations should be conducted. The excavations were accomplished in December of 1986 and a profile of the acequia recorded. At that time monitoring was delayed until the anticipated relocation of a fuel storage tank was to be accomplished; subsequent problem with the location of the tank because of environmental considerations delayed the project for a period of time, eventually requiring placement of the storage tank well away from the path of the acequia...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{specifically}} addresses {{the issue of}} AVL applications in small and medium sized transit agencies. Small to medium <b>transit</b> agencies were <b>contacted</b> to determine their perception of their experience with AVL and the benefits it has provided. All <b>contacted</b> <b>transit</b> agencies that deployed AVL system perceive great benefits of AVL, especially {{in the areas of}} improved efficiency of the system by permitting automated dispatch and scheduling, improved customer services and communication, more efficient use of resources and improved on-time performance. In addition a survey was conducted of transit users in a Wisconsin community to assess the level of importance that they place on features of transit service which AVL can affect. The transit riders consider on-time performance and having real-time information as {{the most important factor in}} transit service. A framework for conducting benefits costs analysis is also provided based on data from the City of Racine, Wisconsin and some assumptions. It was found that consistent with cost-benefit analysis of highway investment, AVL benefits largely occur to transit users if their waiting time can be reduced by even a small amount. AVL systems for small transit agencies also have the potential of sharing the system with other government agencies, such as public works departments, law enforcement agencies and other transit agencies...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{new forms of}} {{electronic}} devices such as electronic papers, flexible displays, epidermal sensors, and smart textiles have become reality. Thin-film transistors (TFTs) are the basic blocks of the circuits used in such devices and need to operate above 100 [*]MHz to efficiently treat signals in RF systems and address pixels in high resolution displays. Beyond {{the choice of the}} semiconductor, i. e., silicon, graphene, organics, or amorphous oxides, the junctionless nature of TFTs and its geometry imply some limitations which become evident and important in devices with scaled channel length. Furthermore, the mechanical instability of flexible substrates limits the feature size of flexible TFTs. Contact resistance and overlapping capacitance are two parasitic effects which limit the transit frequency of transistors. They are often considered independent, while a deeper analysis of TFTs geometry imposes to handle them together; in fact, they both depend on the overlapping length (LOV) between source/drain and the gate contacts. Here, we conduct a quantitative analysis based on a large number of flexible ultra-scaled IGZO TFTs. Devices with three different values of overlap length and channel length down to 0. 5 [*]μm are fabricated to experimentally investigate the scaling behavior of the <b>transit</b> frequency. <b>Contact</b> resistance and overlapping capacitance depend in opposite ways on LOV. These findings establish routes for the optimization of the dimension of source/drain contact pads and suggest design guidelines to achieve megahertz operation in flexible IGZO TFTs and circuits...|$|R
40|$|New neurons and glial {{cells are}} {{generated}} in an extensive germinal niche {{adjacent to the}} walls of the lateral ventricles in the adult brain. The primary progenitors (B 1 cells) have astroglial characteristics but retain important neuroepithelial properties. Recent work shows how B 1 cells contact all major compartments of this niche. They share the “shoreline” on the ventricles with ependymal cells, forming a unique adult ventricular zone (VZ). In the subventricular zone (SVZ), B 1 cells <b>contact</b> <b>transit</b> amplifying (type C) cells, chains of young neurons (A cells), and blood vessels. How signals from these compartments influence the behavior of B 1 or C cells remains largely unknown, but recent work highlights growth factors, neurotransmitters, morphogens, and the extracellular matrix as key regulators of this niche. The integration of emerging molecular and anatomical clues forecasts an exciting new understanding of how the germ of youth is actively maintained in the adult brain...|$|R
40|$|In a {{multiprocessor}} system, it {{is important}} that the shortest path is always selected for inter-process communication. If every node in the system can acquire the accurate status of all nodes, then optimal routing is possible, but this is not feasible in view of the space and time costs involved. We propose a fault-tolerant wormhole routing algorithm for the mesh network in this paper, which is based on the idea of multi-phase minimal routing. The algorithm requires only local information at every node. When messages in <b>transit</b> come in <b>contact</b> with a fault region, they would select a locally minimal path around the region. The proposed algorithm can tolerate convex fault regions with only four virtual channels per physical channel regardless of how processors of different fault regions may overlap. The aggregation of locally minimal path segments gives a complete routing path between source and destination. Via simulation, we find that the algorithm has near optimal performance in most cases. © 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} to {{estimate}} the electron diffusion length in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) is presented. DSCs were fabricated on conducting glass substrates that were patterned by laser ablation of the fluorine-doped tin oxide coating to form parallel contact strips separated by uncontacted strips of the same width. The relative collection efficiency was measured {{as a function of}} the gap between the contact strips, which determines the lateral distance traveled by electrons to reach the contacts. To avoid complications arising from nonlinear recombination kinetics, current measurements were performed using small amplitude perturbations of the electron density close to open circuit and the maximum power point to minimize electron density gradients in the film. One and two-dimensional solutions of the continuity equation for electron transport and back reaction predict that the relative collection efficiency should fall as spacing between the contact strips exceeds the electron diffusion length and electrons are lost by back electron transfer during <b>transit</b> to the <b>contacts.</b> Measurements of the relative collection efficiency were fitted to the predicted dependence of the collection efficiency on the spacing between the contact strips to obtain the value of the electron diffusion length. The diffusion length is found to increase with voltage both at open circuit and at the maximum power point...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the success}} of {{discovering}} transiting exoplanets, several recently observed objects (e. g. KIC- 8462852, J 1407 and PDS- 110) exhibit unconventional transit signals, whose appropriate interpretation {{in terms of a}} spherical single body has been challenging, if not impossible. In the aforementioned examples the presence of a ring-like structure has been proposed for explaining the unusual data. Thus, in this paper we delve into the dynamics of a tilted exoring disturbed by a third close companion, and the role that the Lidov-Kozai mechanism may have to explain irregular and anomalous transit signals of ringed planets, as well as the ring's early stages. To that end, we performed numerical simulations and semi-analytical calculations to assess the ring's dynamical and morphological properties, and their related transit observables. We found that tilted ringed structures undergo short-term changes in shape and orientation that are manifested as strong variations of <b>transit</b> depth and <b>contact</b> times, even between consecutive eclipses. Any detected anomaly in transit characteristics may lead to a miscalculation of the system's properties (planetary radius, semi-major axis, stellar density and others). Moreover, oscillating ring-like structures may account for the strangeness of some light-curve features in already known and future discovered exoplanets.

40|$|This {{article was}} been {{accepted}} for publication in the Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power. The definitive version can be found at: [URL] compression ring-bore conjunction accounts for significant frictional parasitic losses relative to its size. The prerequisite to improving the tribological performance of this contact is a fundamental understanding of ring dynamics within the prevailing transient nature of regime of lubrication. Studies reported thus far take into account ring-bore conformance, based on static fitment of the ring within an out-of-round bore, whose out-of-circularity is affected by manufacturing processes, surface treatment and assembly. The static fitment analyses presume quasi-static equilibrium between ring tension and gas pressure loading with generated conjunctional pressures. This is an implicit assumption of ring rigidity whilst in situ. The current analysis considers the global modal behaviour of the ring as an eigenvalue problem, thus including its dynamic in-plane behaviour in the tribological study of a mixed-hydrodynamic regime of lubrication. The {{results show that the}} <b>contact</b> <b>transit</b> time is shorter than that required for the ring to reach steady state condition. Hence, the conjunction is not only subject to transience on account of changing contact kinematics and varied combustion loading, but also subject to perpetual ring transient dynamics. This renders the ring-bore friction a more complex problem than usually assumed in idealised ring fitment analyses. An interesting finding of the analysis is increased ring-bore clearance at and in the vicinity of top dead centre, which reduces the ring sealing effect and suggests a possible increase in blow-by. The current analysis, integrating ring in-plane modal dynamics and mixed regime of lubrication includes salient features which are closer representation of practice, an approach which has not hitherto been reported in literature...|$|R
40|$|The BIRD {{mission is}} a small {{satellite}} project {{carried out by the}} German Aerospace Center (DLR). Launched on October 22, 2001 its major objectives are the test {{of a new generation of}} infrared array sensors as well as the detection and scientific investigation of hot spots, like forest fires or volcanic activities. As a technology satellite, BIRD is equipped with a GPS-based autonomous navigation system which provides real-time onboard orbit determination as well as orbit and event prediction capabilities. The Onboard Navigation System (ONS) supports the BIRD Attitude Control System with real-time attitude information to allow for a nadir pointing of the spacecraft during image sessions and high-rate data downlinks. In addition, precise ONS position data are merged onboard the spacecraft with BIRD image sensor data, thus enabling a geocoding of satellite images on-the-flight. Furthermore, the ONS derives precise timing information from the GPS receiver, which allows a proper synchronization of the BIRD onboard clock based on the measured bias and the determined drift rate. Finally, NORAD twoline elements are autonomously generated onboard from GPS position data, which are downlinked to a relocatable ground terminal for antenna pointing and pass scheduling. An example of the autonomous navigation capabilities of the ONS is the onboard computation of upcoming shadow <b>transits</b> and station <b>contacts,</b> that serves as a demonstration of more fundamental tasks like the support of onboard experiment scheduling or power management. Starting with an introduction to the BIRD satellite mission, a detailed mathematical description of the algorithms applied within the ONS is given. The concept and architectural design of the implemented system is presented with emphasis on the interaction of the ONS threads and their timing characteristics, followed by a description of the ONS software modules. A series of ONS-related software and hardware-in-theloop test cycles has been conducted in the preparation of the mission, which are presented. Based on more than two months of flight experience, the performance of the ONS is analyzed in detail, demonstrating the reliable performance of the system together with an excellent accuracy performance, which provides real-time position accuracy of a few meters on-board the BIRD satellite...|$|R
