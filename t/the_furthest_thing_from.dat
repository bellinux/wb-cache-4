25|$|Hawkins {{had told}} me aboard the ship that he would put his platoon of men up against any company of {{soldiers}} on earth and guarantee to win. He was slightly wounded by shrapnel as he came ashore in the first wave, but <b>the</b> <b>furthest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>from</b> his mind was to be evacuated. He led his platoon into the forest of coconut palms. During {{a day and a}} half he personally cleaned out six Jap machine gun nests, sometimes standing on top of a track and firing point blank at four or five men who fired back at him from behind blockhouses. Lieutenant Hawkins was wounded a second time, but he still refused to retire. To say that his conduct was worthy of the highest traditions of the Marine Corps is like saying the Empire State Building is moderately high.|$|E
500|$|Howarth stated, [...] "I {{was happy}} to get the part of Todd, but it was <b>the</b> <b>furthest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>from</b> the fabric of my personality." [...] In an {{interview}} later that year, with Soap Opera Weekly, he grimaced when reminded {{of what he had}} said, and commented, [...] "What a totally self-involved, pretentious thing to say." [...] He clarified his previous statement, saying that although he seemed to be consistently cast as a [...] "bad guy" [...] and as a [...] "Greek frat brother-type", both his upbringing and experiences in college were different than those of Todd and his other roles. [...] For example, Howarth was not in a fraternity in college, and, unlike Todd and his previous soap opera roles, Kent in Loving and Jory on Guiding Light, status was unimportant to him.|$|E
5000|$|In 1969, Sunshine Pop group The Peppermint Trolley Company {{walked away}} from their {{contract}} {{for a variety of}} reasons, both financial and creative. They moved to Riverside, California and changed their name to [...] "Bones". According to Danny Faragher, the name was chosen as it was <b>the</b> <b>furthest</b> <b>thing</b> away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> name Peppermint Trolley Company, derived from an Earl Stanley Gardner murder mystery novel.|$|R
50|$|In Belgrade, Nele was {{a refugee}} - albeit a famous one. Together {{with his wife}} Sanja and their infant {{daughter}} he spent his first Belgrade days in the apartment belonging to Rambo Amadeus. For the most part, music was <b>the</b> <b>furthest</b> <b>thing</b> on his mind during this period. He could be seen across town waiting in lines in front of different charity organizations like ADRA in order to send food packages to family members in Sarajevo which was under siege by Serbian forces.|$|R
500|$|... "Partners in Crime" [...] {{features}} several actors {{returning to}} the series. Catherine Tate was offered the opportunity to return as Donna Noble during lunch with executive producer Julie Gardner. Tate, who expected Gardner would ask about appearing in a biopic, later admitted it was [...] "the <b>furthest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>from</b> [...] mind". Tate's return was controversial amongst Doctor Who fans; the criticism she received was compared to Daniel Craig after he was cast as James Bond. Howard Attfield, who appeared as Donna's father Geoff in [...] "The Runaway Bride", filmed several scenes for this episode, but died before his scenes {{for the remainder of}} the season were completed. The producers retired his character out of respect, and dedicated him in the closing credits for the episode. Producer Phil Collinson suggested transferring his traits to the unrelated character Stan Mott from [...] "Voyage of the Damned", and rewriting his role as Donna's grandfather. Executive producers Russell T Davies and Gardner liked the idea and recalled Bernard Cribbins to the role to re-film Attfield's scenes, with the character renamed as Wilfred—a name Davies favoured for Donna's grandfather—in time for the credits of [...] "Voyage of the Damned" [...] to be changed.|$|R
500|$|Paul {{majored in}} English at Boston College where he {{continued}} to participate in track. His best time in the 10,000 meters (30:18:50) remains the fourth best men's outdoor record in Boston College history. When a knee injury in his junior year sidelined him from athletics, Paul picked up an acoustic guitar to pass the time. He taught himself to play guitar {{with the help of}} a [...] Hits of the 70s songbook, and began to write songs. Boston radio included a classic hits station that played the music of Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young and James Taylor; artists who were mostly unfamiliar to Paul. Within a few years they became major influences. [...] Having a career in music was <b>the</b> <b>furthest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>from</b> Paul's mind at that point, but as his playing and writing improved it became a bigger focus in his life. In an interview with FolkWax journalist Arthur Wood, Paul stated: ...|$|E
2500|$|Past Life Martyred Saints {{received}} general acclaim {{from professional}} music critics upon its release.

Heather Phares from Allmusic reserved praise for the album, feeling that it [...] "will win Andersen new fans as well as thrill longtime ones." [...] Priya Elan from NME also responded positively to the album, commenting that [...] "her perceptive glare is intense and unrelenting. A new, added tunefulness makes this a much-welcome Exile In Nihilist-ville." [...] Ian Mathers of PopMatters awarded the record a nine out of ten, feeling that [...] "EMA's work is simultaneously {{some of the most}} interesting I've heard in years, and jaggedly alive, <b>the</b> <b>furthest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>from</b> any sort of academic exercise." ...|$|E
2500|$|Casting {{began in}} early August 2009, with open auditions held in various states. Jesse Eisenberg was first {{announced}} to {{be attached to}} the project in September 2009. (Coincidentally, in an interview with Diane Sawyer on ABC's World News with Diane Sawyer, Zuckerberg revealed that Eisenberg's cousin, Eric Fisher, was a Facebook product designer.) Several days later, Justin Timberlake and Andrew Garfield were confirmed to portray the roles of Sean Parker and Eduardo Saverin, respectively. In October 2009, Brenda Song, Rooney Mara, Armie Hammer, Shelby Young, and Josh Pence were cast. Max Minghella and Dakota Johnson were also confirmed to star in the film. In a 2009 interview with The Baltimore Sun, Eisenberg said, [...] "Even though I've gotten to be in some wonderful movies, this character seems so much more overtly insensitive in so many ways that seem more real to me in the best way. I don't often get cast as insensitive people, so it feels very comfortable: fresh and exciting, as if you {{never have to worry about}} the audience. Not that I worry about the audience anyway – it should be just <b>the</b> <b>furthest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>from</b> your mind. The Social Network is the biggest relief I've ever had in a movie".|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} American {{dream of}} owning a home, obtaining a college education, and working at a good, paying job is only that, a dream, for scores of homeless youth in America today. There is a growing street population {{of young people who}} have been thrown out of their homes by their caretakers or their families, and who face life-threatening situations each day. For these youth, <b>the</b> <b>furthest</b> <b>thing</b> in their lives is reaching the so-called “American Dream;” and their most immediate need is survival, simply living out the day in front of them. They have few options that lead to a decent and safe living environment. Their age, lack of work experience, and absence of a high school diploma make it most difficult to find a job. As a result, they turn to other means for survival; runaways and throwaways are most vulnerable to falling prey to the sex trade, selling drugs, or being lured into human trafficking, and some steal or panhandle. Street youth end up spending their nights in bus stations or finding a room in an abandoned building or an empty stairwell to sleep. Attempting to identify a specific number of homeless youth is difficult at best, but what is even more perplexing is our continued inability to effectively protect our children. We are left with a basic question framed by the fundamental tenets of justice: what is a community’s responsibility to its youth who, for whatever reason, end up living on the streets or in unsafe, abusive environments? The {{purpose of this paper is}} to briefly outline the characteristics of homeless youth, in particular differentiating between throwaways and runaways; explore the current federal response to homeless youth; and finally, address the nagging question that swirls around all children: can we aggressively aspire to be a community where every child is healthy and safe, and able to realize his or her fullest potential...|$|R
60|$|With {{regard to}} the first charge, my friends have spoken to ms {{of it in the}} style of amicable expostulation,--not so much blaming the thing as lamenting the effects. Others, less partial to me, were less kind in {{assigning}} the motives. I admit, there is a decorum and propriety in a member of Parliament's paying a respectful court to his constituents. If I were conscious to myself that pleasure, or dissipation, or low, unworthy occupations had detained me from personal attendance on you, I would readily admit my fault, and quietly submit to the penalty. But, Gentlemen, I live at an hundred miles' distance from Bristol; {{and at the end of}} a session I come to my own house, fatigued in body and in mind, to a little repose, and to a very little attention to my family and my private concerns. A visit to Bristol is always a sort of canvass, else it will do more harm than good. To pass from the toils of a session to the toils of a canvass is <b>the</b> <b>furthest</b> <b>thing</b> in <b>the</b> world <b>from</b> repose. I could hardly serve you as I have done, and court you too. Most of you have heard that I do not very remarkably spare myself in public business; and in the private business of my constituents I have done very near as much as those who have nothing else to do. My canvass of you was not on the 'change, nor in the county meetings, nor in the clubs of this city: it was in the House of Commons; it was at the Custom-House; it was at the Council; it was at the Treasury; it was at the Admiralty. I canvassed you through your affairs, and not your persons. I was not only your representative as a body; I was the agent, the solicitor of individuals; I ran about wherever your affairs could call me; and in acting for you, I often appeared rather as a ship-broker than as a member of Parliament. There was nothing too laborious or too low for me to undertake. The meanness of the business was raised by the dignity of the object. If some lesser matters have slipped through my fingers, it was because I filled my hands too full, and, in my eagerness to serve you, took in more than any hands could grasp. Several gentlemen stand round me who are my willing witnesses; and there are others who, if they were here, would be still better, because they would be unwilling witnesses to the same truth. It was in the middle of a summer residence in London, and in the middle of a negotiation at the Admiralty for your trade, that I was called to Bristol; and this late visit, at this late day, has been possibly in prejudice to your affairs.|$|R

2500|$|Upon arrival, Bree {{was shown}} as a polite and sensitive, well trained doctor, sharply {{contrasting}} her sister Brooke (Beth Allen). The character made friends quickly and appeared overly generous. However, as the character developed, {{it was revealed}} she too had a nasty side and {{was a lot more}} similar to Brooke than originally thought. Blampied enjoyed playing the personality change, labelling it as; [...] "making a great descent" [...] and stating; [...] "It's a massive change from how the character arrived and through her relationship with Brooke and Vinnie, it goes haywire. I'm looking forward to the challenge of how to justify those decisions she makes." [...] Bree's manipulative persona was blamed on her [...] "tumultuous upbringing" [...] which saw her be fostered by several families before being adopted at 10. As a result, she suffered from self-consciousness. Blampied enjoyed playing such a complex character, stating: [...] "It's definitely a lot more interesting than always being the nice guy because you do get to say and do some things you would never do and it's <b>the</b> <b>furthest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>from</b> my personal character and demeanor, so it is quite a turnaround." [...] Blampied went on to explain her mixed opinions of Bree: [...] "I obviously don't agree with what she's doing. Sometimes I read the script and go, 'Why are you doing that? There are a hundred easier ways to do that.' I have days where I really don't like Bree and what she's doing." [...] The character has been described as [...] "conniving" [...] and [...] "scheming". Blampied did not at first realise how manipulative Bree was to become and when she realised the extent to which writers were pushing her antagonistic characterisation, she described it as [...] "daunting". However Blampied had been warned, [...] "Someone told me, if you're on Shortland Street, always play your character as if you have a secret – because you will have a secret!" [...] To portray Bree's penultimate breakdown, Blampied researched borderline personality disorder and severe narcissism. Blampied enjoyed how Bree was portrayed in her final scene, stating: [...] "We don't often see Bree's vulnerable side side and when we do she's still being manipulative and deceitful ... I really like the way she ends up because {{there is an element of}} real sadness to it ... when she realises how wrong she's been." [...] Blampied cared for her character and hoped for an uneventful future for Bree, [...] "I'd like to see her get well, hold down a job and maybe even get into a relationship. Life is hard for her and always has been. I care about Bree and I know that sounds like a weird thing to say." [...] Describing Bree upon her return, Blampied stated, [...] "She's still mentally very fragile, and her manipulative tendencies are most definitely still at the surface", but affirmed, [...] "she's a lot more aware now though".|$|E
60|$|Joan leaned back, {{within reach}} of him, with {{her head in her}} saddle, and pulling a blanket up over her, relaxed her limbs to rest. Sleep seemed <b>the</b> <b>furthest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>from</b> her. She {{wondered}} that she dared to think of it. The night had grown chilly; the wind was sweeping with low roar through the balsams; the fire burned dull and red. Joan watched the black, shapeless hulk that she knew to be Gulden. For a long time he remained motionless. By and by he moved, approached the fire, stood one moment in the dying ruddy glow, his great breadth and bulk magnified, with all about him vague and shadowy, but the more sinister for that. The cavernous eyes were only black spaces in that vast face, yet Joan saw them upon her. He lay down then among the other men and soon his deep and heavy breathing denoted the tranquil slumber of an ox.|$|E

50|$|The young Prince Albert, called Bertie {{by members}} of the family, is not having a {{particularly}} happy childhood. The elder Prince Albert, encouraged by Baron Stockmar, has very definite views about his son's education including the need for non-stop work, both in the classroom and out, and very strict discipline. Bertie rebels, bewildering and distressing Victoria and Albert, and the only solution seems to be ever more discipline. He is clearly a disappointment to his father, who had hoped his son would be a new kind of leader, a scholar who knows and understands the world but that is clearly not to be, at least not to his satisfaction. Bertie nonetheless accompanies his parents on a state visit to Paris and charms Napoleon III and Empress Eugenie. Albert, however, soon dismisses his eldest son and {{spends most of his time}} ensuring the happiness of his eldest daughter Princess Victoria, known as Vicky.
