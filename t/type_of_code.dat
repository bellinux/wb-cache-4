2500|$|Recently, Donald L. McCabe and Linda Klebe Trevino, two {{experts in}} the field of {{academic}} dishonesty, have proposed a new way of deterring cheating that has been implemented in schools such as the University of Maryland. Modified honor codes put students in charge of the judicial hearing process, making it clear that it is the students' responsibility to stop cheating amongst themselves, {{but at the same time}} students still have proctored exams and are not allowed to take pledges of good conduct in place of professor oversight. [...] The researchers who advocate this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>code</b> seem to think that the normal honor code is something of a special case that is not applicable to many schools. [...] According to supporters of this system, schools with a large student body, a weak college community, or no history of student self-governance will not be able to support a full honor code. However, while modified honor codes seem to be more effective than faculty or administration run integrity codes of conduct, research shows that schools with modified codes still have higher rates of cheating than schools with full honor codes.|$|E

The writer was interested in investigating code mixing because the Indonesian community is a multilingual community. In the multilingual community, people tend to use two or more codes in their communication, which is called code mixing. The writer focused her study on the use <b>of</b> <b>code</b> mixing and the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>code</b> mixing occurring in the article Blue Sauna Eropa Timur of Jakarta Undercover 2 : Karnaval Malam. The writer used Lumintaintang?s study (1998, pp. 33 - 35) to identify the Jakartanese code and Harijatiwidjaja and Hastuti?s study (1995, p. 39) to identify the Javanese code. To identify the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>code</b> mixing, the writer used Kachru?s theory (1982, p. 39).

50|$|This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>code</b> is used {{to encode}} {{continuous}} variables such as joint position, eye position, color, or sound frequency. Any individual neuron is too noisy to faithfully encode the variable using rate coding, but an entire population ensures greater fidelity and precision. For a population of unimodal tuning curves, i.e. with a single peak, the precision typically scales linearly {{with the number of}} neurons. Hence, for half the precision, half as many neurons are required. In contrast, when the tuning curves have multiple peaks, as in grid cells that represent space, the precision of the population can scale exponentially with the number of neurons. This greatly reduces the number of neurons required for the same precision.|$|E
