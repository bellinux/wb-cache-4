500|$|We {{really wanted}} to spend time, immerse ourselves, drive {{for hours and hours}} aimlessly with a camera, jumping out and {{shooting}} things that caught my eye. We didn't want <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> just shoot Frenchy's Chicken and call it an [...] "authentic video." [...] There was tons of hanging out, getting the feel, all with cameras ready. We hooked up with our dude Scotty who was a great help, plus Bun B's brother Truck, and Paul Wall. The city was so receptive, so willing to help, so open, and that leant a lot {{to the fact that we}} really got to glimpse of the real character of Houston.|$|E
500|$|Hamlin, who led {{the most}} laps, {{described}} his frustration: [...] "The strategy and what-not at the end just didn't work our way. That's all I can ask for, {{is to have the}} better car than those two guys – and we did. But, unfortunately, the strategy bit us. We're just going to have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> do it the old-fashioned way next week and try to beat them on the race track." [...] Afterward, Newman, who finished second, commented, [...] "We were saving fuel the whole time. Made more sense to save fuel. We were two laps short. We just did what I thought we needed to do. If Carl made it, Carl made it." [...] Fifth place finisher Johnson described his happiness by saying: [...] "We're going to go home and we're going to make sure we have the best engines, go through our simulation stuff, make sure our car is as fast as it can be and then race. We were in a good situation and could take the risk, take the chance. It worked out for us.|$|E
500|$|Adrien Niyonshuti, {{who at the}} age of 25 {{was taking}} part in his first Olympic Games, was Rwanda's sole {{representative}} in the men's cross-country cycling event, and was notable for carrying his nation's flag at the opening and closing ceremonies. He qualified for the Games based on his performance at the 2011 African Continental Mountain Bike Championship. Niyonshuti said that he was putting his focus towards the event and wanted to impress his family, [...] "To have everyone say they are behind me makes me feel good. When people congratulate me for getting to the Olympics, it gives me a confidence and it tells me that yeah, I did well. I just want <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> compete and finish the race. To know that so many people are behind me makes me not want to disappoint them." [...] He took part in the 12 August race, finishing 39th out of 40 cyclists, with a time of one hour, 42 minutes and 46 seconds. Niyonshuti ranked behind Russia's Evgeniy Pechenin (one hour, 41 minutes and 40 seconds) Chan Chun Hing of Hong Kong (one hour, 41 minutes and 59 seconds) but in front of last place finisher Marios Athanasiadis from Cyprus (one hour, 43 minutes and 25 seconds). He was 13 minutes and 39 seconds behind the race winner Jaroslav Kulhavý of the Czech Republic (one hour, 29 minutes and seven seconds).|$|E

6000|$|Lord John had at once in this {{connection}} a bright idea. [...] "Shouldn't you like <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back <b>there</b> <b>and</b> take the measure yourself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear, do let me go!' said Minnikin; 'I should so like <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down <b>there</b> <b>and</b> amuse {{myself a}} little with the other children.' ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{next day}} trains loaded with workers from {{factories}} in Oltenia arrived in Timișoara. The regime {{was attempting to}} use them to repress the mass protests, but after a brief encounter they ended up joining the protests. One worker explained, [...] "Yesterday our factory boss and a party official rounded us up in the yard, handed us wooden clubs and told us that Hungarians and ‘hooligans’ were devastating Timișoara and that it is our duty <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> help crush the riots. But I realised that wasn't the truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 28, 2005 the BBC {{reported}} that Alan Thirkettle, head of ESA's Human Spaceflight Development Department, stated that Kliper would be used: [...] "For future exploration, {{when we have}} the objective of going to the Moon, {{it is important to have}} several possibilities <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> within this framework of cooperation to have our own access to orbit around the Moon." [...] In the same context, Alain Fournier-Sicre, head of the ESA permanent mission in the Russian Federation, also stated that: [...] "The objective is to have a vehicle which is more comfortable than the Soyuz capsule which will be used with pilots and four passengers… [...] It is meant to service the space station and to go between Earth and an orbit around the Moon with six crew members." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Gimme Shelter DVD {{contains}} extensive {{excerpts from}} that broadcast. A Hells Angels member who {{identified himself as}} [...] "Pete, from Hells Angels San Francisco" [...] (most likely Pete Knell, president of the San Francisco chapter), says [...] "they offered us $500 worth of beer (<b>to)</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> {{take care of the}} stage ... we took this $500 worth of beer to do it." [...] Sonny Barger, who also called into the KSAN forum, states: [...] "We were told by one of the (other Hells Angels) clubs if we showed up down there (and) sat on the stage and drink some beer ... that the Stones manager or somebody had bought for us." [...] In his lengthy call, Barger mentions the beer deal yet again: [...] "I ain't no cop, I ain't never going to ever pretend to be no cop. I didn't go there to police nothing, man. They told me if I could {{sit on the edge of}} the stage so nobody could climb over me, I could drink beer until the show was over. And that's what I went there to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know, but {{how could}} we face the people--I should never be able <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down <b>there.</b> <b>And</b> {{most of them have}} such {{enormous}} families." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{heard her}} whistle, but he {{remained}} at the saw-horse. It would do in the country, but not here. He had no right <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in <b>there</b> <b>and</b> eat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Panney," [...] cried Dora, sitting {{upright in}} her chair, [...] "do {{you mean that}} I ought <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> try <b>to</b> catch Ralph Haverley, {{no matter how they}} treat me?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Therewhat did I tell you? I have a presentimentthe {{spirit of}} prophecy is upon me. She {{is going to}} appoint him, and we are <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> do him homage. Come along!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was gaun {{to see the}} Duke of Argyle, forby Mrs. Glass," [...] said Jeanie; [...] "and if your honour {{thinks it}} would be best <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> first, <b>and</b> get some of his Grace's folk to show me my cousin's shop" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Paulina is {{nice and}} good," [...] said Valetta, [...] "she has heard all about St. Kenelm's, <b>and</b> wants <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>there.</b> Yes, <b>and</b> she {{means to be}} a Sister of Charity, only she is afraid her sister is narrow and low church." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "This is how grassroots, {{democratic}} politics work. To a certain extent, {{this is how}} {{democratic politics}} {{is supposed to work}} in general. You convince people of the validity of your ideas. You have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out <b>there</b> <b>and</b> convince people." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Some of the circulars are <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> also back to Hopeville. Supposing {{you take}} them with you now, and start out distributing them from your home, instead of coming here? It will save time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't got {{the grit}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> {{look at a}} paper in cold blood," [...] he told Anne. [...] "I'm just going to wait until {{somebody}} comes and tells me suddenly whether I've passed or not." ...|$|E
6000|$|He sought his wife, in the pantry, and exploded, [...] "I'd like <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in <b>there</b> <b>and</b> {{throw some}} of those young pups out of the house! They talk down to me like I was the butler! I'd like to--" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, it's a dandy scheme, all right, Bill," [...] responded Werner. And then {{he began}} a {{description}} of a winter's camp and told how he had permission <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> how he wanted Glutts to go with him.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{makes me}} wretched enough," [...] said the squire. [...] "But I didn't come {{to talk about}} that. I've brought you a note from Lady Julia De Guest, and I've had one from the earl. They want us all <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> stay the week after Easter." ...|$|E
60|$|At any rate, Nigel {{remained}} silent till the wherry approached {{the town of}} Greenwich, when he commanded the men to put in for the nearest landing-place, as it was his purpose <b>to</b> <b>go</b> ashore <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> dismiss them from further attendance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, then, I {{want this}} case explained. THEY wanted {{to explain it}} to me--as if there hadn't been emotion or {{excitement}} enough already. You knew my orders; how did you dare <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in <b>there</b> <b>and</b> get up that riot?" ...|$|R
60|$|In the {{afternoon}} {{he went out}} of the house again, and she watched him drive away {{in the direction of the}} county-town.

60|$|Colville {{took the}} Piazza San Marco {{in on his}} way to Palazzo Pinti on the morning when he had made up his mind <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> he stood at the window looking out with the old man, when some more maskers passed through the place--two young fellows in old Florentine dress, with a third habited as a nun.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where {{they laid}} him as {{was very good}} to me, very good to me indeed he was. It's {{time for me to}} go down to that there burying-ground, sir, and ask to be put along of him.

60|$|Julia left last Saturday for St. Louis {{where she}} will {{probably}} {{spend a couple of}} weeks and return here should I still remain.
