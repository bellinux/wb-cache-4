It partially contributes to erection, which are primarily caused by the <b>two</b> <b>corpora</b> cavernosa that comprise the bulk of the shaft; like the female cavernosa, the male cavernosa soak up blood and become erect when sexually excited. The male corpora cavernosa taper off internally on reaching the spongiosum head. With regard to the Y-shape of the cavernosa– crown, body, and legs– the body accounts for much more of the structure in men, and the legs are stubbier; typically, the cavernosa are longer and thicker in males than in females.|$|E

50|$|The <b>two</b> <b>corpora</b> cavernosa and corpus spongiosum (also {{known as}} the corpus cavernosum urethrae in older texts and in the {{adjacent}} diagram) are three expandable erectile tissues {{along the length of}} the penis, which fill with blood during penile erection. The <b>two</b> <b>corpora</b> cavernosa lie along the penis shaft, from the pubic bones to the head of the penis, where they join. These formations are made of a sponge-like tissue containing trabeculae, irregular blood-filled spaces lined by endothelium and separated by connective tissue septa.|$|E

Although this approach is becoming increasingly popular, the differences between simulated and real corpora are not well studied. We build two simulation models to interact with an intelligent tutoring system. Both models are trained on <b>two</b> different real <b>corpora</b> separately. We use several evaluation measures proposed in previous research to compare between our <b>two</b> simulated <b>corpora,</b> between the original <b>two</b> real <b>corpora,</b> and between the simulated and real corpora. We next examine the differentiating power of these measures. Our results show that although these simple statistical measures can distinguish real corpora from simulated ones, these measures cannot help us to draw a conclusion on the "reality" of the simulated <b>corpora</b> since even <b>two</b> real <b>corpora</b> can be very different when evaluated on the same measures. copyright © 2006, American Association for Artificial Intelligence (www. aaai. org).

50|$|It {{is normal}} to {{correlate}} the erection of the penis with male sexual arousal. Physical or psychological stimulation, or both, leads to vasodilation {{and the increased}} blood flow engorges the three spongy areas that run {{along the length of}} the penis (the <b>two</b> <b>corpora</b> cavernosa and the corpus spongiosum). The penis grows enlarged and firm, the skin of the scrotum is pulled tighter, and the testes are pulled up against the body. However, the relationship between erection and arousal is not one-to-one. After their mid-forties, some men report that they do not always have an erection when they are sexually aroused. Equally, a male erection can occur during sleep (nocturnal penile tumescence) without conscious sexual arousal or due to mechanical stimulation (e.g. rubbing against the bed sheet) alone. A young man — or one with a strong sexual drive — may experience enough sexual arousal for an erection to result from a passing thought, or just the sight of a passerby. Once erect, his penis may gain enough stimulation from contact with the inside of his clothing to maintain and encourage it for some time.|$|E
