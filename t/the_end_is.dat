5|$|The {{eleventh}} nocturne {{was written}} in memory of Noémi Lalo; her widower, Pierre Lalo, was a music critic and a friend and supporter of Fauré. Morrison suggests that its funereal effect of tolling bells may also reflect the composer's own state of anguish, with deafness encroaching. The melodic line is simple and restrained, and except for a passionate section near <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>is</b> generally quiet and elegiac.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys gorgasi is a {{medium-sized}} oryzomyine with small ears and large feet, and {{is similar to}} the marsh rice rat in general appearance. The long and coarse fur is brownish above and ochraceous below. At the base of the tail, the upper and lower sides differ in color and at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>is</b> a short tuft of hairs. The scales on the tail are well-developed. As in other Oryzomys, the hindfeet exhibit specializations for life in the water. The plantar (lower) surface of the metatarsus is naked. Two of the pads are very small. Ungual tufts, tufts of hair at the bases of the claws, are poorly developed. Interdigital webbing is present, but extends along {{less than half of the}} first phalanges.|$|E
5|$|Reluctant to give Rupert back to Stewie, Stanford Cordray (the buyer, {{voiced by}} Rob Lowe) {{and his family}} {{organize}} a skiing race down the mountain, so if Stewie is the first down, {{they are allowed to}} take Rupert away with them and if Stanford wins, he can have Brian. Stewie cheats by installing rockets in his skis, and relaxes to watch his progress. Stewie then crashes into a tree and loses the race. He tells Brian that maybe this means he should give up Rupert, but he proceeds to grab Rupert after telling his personal butler Crohn to throw a cup of hot tea on the child's face, forcing him to drop the bear. The two make a run for it before the child's parents notice, then realize they still {{need to get back to}} Quahog (which, by looking at a highway sign at <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>is</b> 2112 miles away, a reference to the Rush 1976 album), so they carjack a passing driver in the city and drive home.|$|E
5000|$|In {{some cases}} in which <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> <b>is</b> {{immediately}} followed by an unvoiced consonant in a compound, <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> <b>is</b> lost, and <b>the</b> consonant becomes geminate.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>ends</b> of <b>the</b> ground, {{where the}} AFL goal posts are located, are {{generally}} named after VFL/AFL goal-kicking legends Tony 'Plugger' Lockett and Gordon Coventry. <b>The</b> northern <b>end</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Lockett <b>End,</b> and <b>the</b> southern <b>end,</b> <b>the</b> Coventry <b>End.</b> These names <b>are</b> {{subject to changes}} as appropriate for circumstances: for Essendon home matches, <b>the</b> Coventry <b>End</b> <b>is</b> renamed <b>the</b> Lloyd <b>End</b> and <b>the</b> Lockett <b>End</b> <b>is</b> renamed <b>the</b> Fletcher <b>End,</b> for Western Bulldogs home matches, <b>the</b> Lockett <b>End</b> <b>is</b> renamed <b>the</b> Footscray <b>End</b> and for VFL games, <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>are</b> renamed after VFA/VFL goal-kicking legends Jim 'Frosty' Miller and Fred Cook.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>End</b> <b>was</b> {{a nightclub}} in <b>the</b> West <b>End</b> of London, England. Started in December 1995 by DJs Layo Paskin and Mr C, <b>The</b> <b>End</b> <b>was</b> world-renowned. [...] It was also {{responsible}} for <b>the</b> label <b>End</b> Recordings.|$|R

5000|$|Illative: <b>The</b> <b>ending</b> <b>is</b> usually -Vn, where V {{indicates}} the preceding vowel of the stem. Singular forms use the strong stem form. In {{cases where the}} genitive stem already ends in a long vowel <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> <b>is</b> -seen (singular) and -siin (plural). However, for words of one syllable <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> <b>is</b> always -hVn and this form is also used in plural forms where the plural stem already contains a vowel (other than i [...] ) immediately before the plural i.|$|R
50|$|Otherwise, <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> <b>is</b> -ний.|$|R

50|$|The {{opposing}} {{force in the}} unknown world, <b>the</b> <b>Ends</b> <b>are,</b> like <b>the</b> Drifters, mainly composed of powerful historical figures who died under unorthodox and often violent circumstances. Unlike the Drifters, however, <b>the</b> <b>Ends</b> <b>are</b> revered humans that have forsaken their humanity, and are thus capable of using supernatural powers. Most of <b>the</b> <b>Ends</b> <b>are</b> driven completely by an intense hate for humanity for the various betrayals each suffered back on Earth. They {{seem to have been}} brought into the new world by EASY, who is at odds with Murasaki.|$|R

25|$|This equipment, {{consisting}} of a rest with a single extended neck and a fork-like prong at <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>is</b> used to give extra cueing distance over a group of balls.

25|$|The {{contents}} of the seven missing leaves from <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>is</b> uncertain. There would be enough space for 2 Thessalonians and possibly Philemon, {{but not for the}} Pastoral epistles. Kenyon calculates that 2 Thessalonians would require two leaves, leaving only five remaining leaves (10 pages) for the remaining canonical Pauline literature — 1 Timothy (estimated 8.25 pages), 2 Timothy (6 pages), Titus (3.5 pages) and Philemon (1.5 pages) — totaling ten required leaves (19.25 pages).|$|E
25|$|Bar, tube, {{and wire}} drawing all work upon the same principle: the {{starting}} stock drawn through a die {{to reduce the}} diameter and increase the length. Usually the die is mounted on a draw bench. The end of the workpiece is reduced or pointed to get the end through the die. <b>The</b> <b>end</b> <b>is</b> then placed in grips {{and the rest of}} the workpiece is pulled through the die. Steels, copper alloys, and aluminium alloys are common materials that are drawn.|$|E
25|$|Where a {{business}} name {{is based on}} a family name it should in theory take an apostrophe, but many leave it out (contrast Sainsbury’s with Harrods). In recent times there has been an increasing tendency to drop the apostrophe. Names based on a first name are more likely to take an apostrophe, but this is not always the case. Some business names may inadvertently spell a different name if the name with an s at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>is</b> also a name, such as Parson.|$|E
