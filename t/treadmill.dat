5|$|An {{important}} part of the crew's schedule was regular exercise. They had three pieces of equipment for this: a stationary bicycle, a <b>treadmill</b> (TVIS), and a resistance device (IRED) for weight-lifting. The bicycle malfunctioned in mid-December 2000, and wasn't fixed until March. The <b>treadmill,</b> which used bungee cords to keep the crew member in place, was designed to reduce the vibrations caused by running. A normal <b>treadmill</b> would have produced enough vibrations to shake the station, and potentially affect the sensitive science experiments on board. The <b>treadmill</b> malfunctioned near the end of February, but some in-flight maintenance fixed the problem within a week.|$|E
5|$|Riding on a <b>treadmill</b> is {{theoretically}} {{identical to}} riding on stationary pavement, and physical testing has confirmed this. Treadmills {{have been developed}} specifically for indoor bicycle training. Riding on rollers is still under investigation.|$|E
5|$|Two {{external}} factors had their impacts on Verdi's compositions of this period. One {{is that with}} increasing reputation and financial security he no longer needed to commit himself to the productive <b>treadmill,</b> had more freedom to choose his own subjects, and {{had more time to}} develop them according to his own ideas. In the years 1849 to 1859 he wrote eight new operas, compared with fourteen in the previous ten years.|$|E
40|$|We have {{determined}} the <b>treadmilling</b> rate of brain microtubules (MTs) free of MT-associated proteins (MAPs) at polymer mass steady state in vitro by using [3 H]GTP-exchange. We developed buffer conditions that suppressed dynamic instability behavior by ≈ 10 -fold {{to minimize the}} contribution of dynamic instability to total tubulin-GTP exchange. The MTs <b>treadmilled</b> rapidly under the suppressed dynamic instability conditions, at a minimum rate of 0. 2 μm/min. Thus, rapid <b>treadmilling</b> is an intrinsic property of MAP-free MTs. Further, we show that tau, an axonal stabilizing MAP involved in Alzheimer’s disease, strongly suppresses the <b>treadmilling</b> rate. These results indicate that tau’s function in axons might involve suppression of axonal MT <b>treadmilling.</b> We describe mathematically how <b>treadmilling</b> and dynamic instability are mechanistically distinct MT behaviors. Finally, we present a model that explains how small changes in the critical tubulin subunit concentration at MT minus ends, caused by intrinsic differences in rate constants or regulatory proteins, could produce large changes in the <b>treadmilling</b> rate...|$|R
50|$|While <b>treadmilling</b> {{may occur}} at {{different}} speeds at both ends, {{there is a}} concentration at which the speed of growth at the (+) end {{is equal to the}} rate of shrinkage at the (-) end. This is deemed steady-state <b>treadmilling</b> in which the net length of the <b>treadmilling</b> filament remains unchanged.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Design of a health/fitness {{facility}} {{is a crucial}} element in managing risks to its operators, users and others. Improper location of <b>treadmills</b> not compliant with industry recommendations can {{increase the risk of}} injuries, adverse events and subsequent legal liability for health/fitness facility operators. The aim of our study was to analyse the location (spacing and placement) of <b>treadmills</b> in health/fitness facilities in Australia. Methods: An on-site observational audit was conducted at regional and metropolitan health/fitness facilities (n = 11) in New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria and Queensland. The spacing surrounding the <b>treadmills</b> was measured in centimetres (cm). Placement was assessed by the objects within two metres behind the <b>treadmills.</b> Results: In all health/fitness facilities the distances surrounding the <b>treadmills</b> on the sides, and behind were less than the recommended minimum distances (0. 5 - 1 m on the sides, 2 m behind) by the manufacturers. In most of the health/ fitness facilities there was other equipment (60 %, n = 6) within two metres behind the <b>treadmills.</b> Discussion: The findings suggest that most of the health/fitness facilities audited in this study do not comply with industry minimum recommendations on location of <b>treadmills</b> necessary for safe operation. Conclusion: Health/fitness facility operators in Australia should be trained to increase their awareness about the risks associated with improper location of <b>treadmills</b> to take appropriate preventive measures...|$|R
5|$|In 1974, R.A. Powell raised two fisher kits for {{the purpose}} of {{performing}} scientific research. His primary interest was an attempt to measure the activity of fishers in order to determine how much food the animals required to function. He did this by running them through <b>treadmill</b> exercises that simulated activity in the wild. He compared this to their food intake and used the data to estimate daily food requirements. The research lasted for two years. After one year, one of the fishers died due to unknown causes. The second was released back into the wilderness of Michigan's Upper Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Kelly and Mission Specialist Linda Godwin {{used the}} Shuttle's robotic arm {{to lift the}} Raffaello Multi-Purpose Logistics Module from the shuttle payload bay and attach it to a berth on the station's Unity node. The crews began {{unloading}} supplies the same day. Mission managers extended Endeavour's flight duration to 12 days to allow the crew to assist with additional maintenance tasks on the station, including work on a <b>treadmill</b> and replacing a failed compressor {{in one of the}} air conditioners in the Zvezda Service Module. A change of command ceremony took place on December 13 as Expedition 3 ended and Expedition 4 began. STS-108 returned to Earth with the previous ISS crew of three men.|$|E
5|$|Ono {{was also}} an {{experimental}} filmmaker who made 16 short films between 1964 and 1972, gaining particular renown for a 1966 Fluxus film called simply No. 4, {{often referred to as}} Bottoms. The five-and-a-half-minute film consists of a series of close-ups of human buttocks walking on a <b>treadmill.</b> The screen is divided into four almost equal sections by the elements of the gluteal cleft and the horizontal gluteal crease. The soundtrack consists of interviews with those who are being filmed, as well as those considering joining the project. In 1996, the watch manufacturing company Swatch produced a limited edition watch that commemorated this film.|$|E

25|$|<b>Treadmills</b> {{are used}} to allow animals to walk or run while {{remaining}} stationary with respect to external observers. This technique facilitates filming or recordings of physiological information from the animal (e.g., during studies of energetics).

5|$|Pistorius uses {{custom-made}} spike pads on the blades. Before {{development of}} the pads, his spikes were changed by roughing up the surface and applying over-the-counter spikes by hand, but the results using this method were inconsistent. Research was conducted in Össur’s Iceland lab using a pressure-sensitive <b>treadmill</b> and film at 500 fps to measure the blade strike, and produced a spike pad which includes a midsole of two machine-molded pieces of foam of different densities to cushion impact, with a carbon fibre plate on the bottom. The developers attached the pad with contact cement, which can be quickly removed with the application of heat when the spike pad needs to be changed.|$|E
5|$|Silver, he writes, {{does not}} occur in native form {{and has to be}} mined, usually {{occurring}} with lead ores. Spain produced the most silver in his time, many of the mines having been started by Hannibal. One of the largest had galleries running up to two miles into the mountain, while men worked day and night draining the mine in shifts. Pliny is probably referring to the reverse overshot water-wheels operated by <b>treadmill</b> and found in Roman mines. Britain, he says, is very rich in lead, which is found on the surface at many places, and thus very easy to extract; production was so high that a law was passed attempting to restrict mining.|$|E
5|$|The {{headquarters}} of North Yorkshire County Council (County Hall) and Hambleton District Council (the Civic Centre) are both located in Northallerton; these serve many parishes in the area. The RPA (Rural Payments Agency) was based here until 2014. The nearby base at RAF Leeming {{is a major}} source of employment and income in the area. Northallerton Prison, which used to house young offenders and adults from the North Yorkshire area, closed in 2014. It once had the world's largest <b>treadmill.</b>|$|E
50|$|Two main {{theories}} {{exist on}} microtubule movement within the cell: dynamic instability and <b>treadmilling.</b> Dynamic instability {{occurs when the}} microtubule assembles and disassembles at one end only, while <b>treadmilling</b> occurs when one end polymerizes while the other end disassembles. However, the biological significance of <b>treadmilling</b> in vivo is not well characterized. This {{is due to the}} fact that within a living cell, many microtubules are tightly anchored at one end of the filament. Some research has suggested that the differences in critical concentration between the positive and the negative end may be a way for the cell to prevent unwanted polymerization events.|$|R

5|$|In 2008 a {{research}} team including Alena Grabowski, Rodger Kram and Hugh Herr conducted a follow-up study of single amputees with running blades {{which was published}} in Biology Letters. Each of six amputees' affected leg performance was compared against that of their biological leg. The team measured leg swing times and force applied to the running surface on a high-speed <b>treadmill</b> at the Biomechanics Laboratory of the Orthopedic Specialty Hospital, and also studied video of sprint runners from the Olympics and Paralympics. They found no difference in leg swing times at different speeds, and recorded leg swing times similar to that of non-disabled sprinters. They also found that single running blades reduced the foot to ground force production of the tested runners by an average of 9 percent. Because force production is generally considered the most significant factor in running speed, the researchers concluded that this reduction in force limited the sprinters' top speed. Grabowski also found that amputees typically increased their leg swing times to compensate for the lack of force.|$|E
5|$|The {{builders}} {{would have}} made extensive use of cranes and block and tackle pulleys to lift the stones into place. Much of the work {{could have been done}} using simple sheers operated by a windlass. For the largest blocks, a massive human-powered <b>treadmill</b> would have been used; such machines were still being used in the quarries of Provence until as late as the start of the 20th century. A complex scaffold was erected to support the bridge as it was being built. Large blocks were left protruding from the bridge to support the frames and scaffolds used during construction. The aqueduct as a whole would have been a very expensive undertaking; Émile Espérandieu estimated the cost to be over 30 million sesterces, equivalent to 50 years' pay for 500 new recruits in a Roman legion.|$|E
5|$|The tour's {{production}} and staging {{consisted of a}} 60 foot tall rotating LED cuboid {{referred to as the}} 'Monolith', a <b>treadmill</b> runway and a secondary stage that stores and produces 2,000 gallons of water. The theme of the tour was described as following the same linear chapters to that of the tour's supporting album Lemonade, with each rotation of the aforementioned 'Monolith' representing a new chapter of the show. Several music critics gave the show positive reviews, with a variety of publications praising both the tour's {{production and}} Beyoncé's performance and vocal abilities. The tour had a variety of notable opening acts, including a number of special guests joining prominent opener DJ Khaled on stage. Supporting acts also included artists signed to Beyoncé's own management company, Parkwood Entertainment, such as the duo CHLOE X HALLE, who were relatively unknown at the time.|$|E

50|$|Some riders {{also have}} access to equine <b>treadmills</b> or {{swimming}} pools. <b>Treadmills</b> can sometimes be adjusted to have a slight incline, allowing the horse to work without the added weight of the rider. Swimming is an excellent form of conditioning, and allows the rider to increase the horse's cardiovascular and muscular condition without adding undue stress to the bones or soft tissue.|$|R

25|$|<b>Treadmill</b> {{training}} (more {{commonly known}} as body weight supported <b>treadmill</b> training) can be applied via manual (therapist) or robotic assistance. In manual <b>treadmill</b> training the therapists provide assistance to facilitate an upright posture and a normal stepping pattern. Therapist assistance may be provided at the patient’s pelvis, leg and foot, and a third therapist controlling the <b>treadmill</b> settings. In robotic-assisted <b>treadmill</b> training, a device replaces the need for therapists to assist the patient in generating a normal stepping pattern. Currently, there are three different models available: Hocoma's Lokomat, the HealthSouth AutoAmbulator, and the Mechanized Gait Trainer II. The Lokomat is a driven gait orthosis that consists of a computer -controlled exoskeleton that secured to the patient’s legs while being supported over a <b>treadmill.</b> In addition to a belt driven <b>treadmill</b> and an overhead lift, the HealthSouth AutoAmbulator also includes a pair of articulated arms (that drives the hip and knee joints) and two upright structures that house the computer controls and body-weight unloading mechanism. Unlike the first two, the Mechanized Gait Trainer II does not work {{in conjunction with a}} treadmill; instead it is based on a crank and rocker gear system which provides limb motion similar to an elliptical trainer. Robotic-assisted <b>treadmill</b> training was developed with three goals in mind: 1. to decrease therapist physical demand and time, 2. to improve repeatability of step kinematics, and 3. to increase volume of locomotor training.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the behavior of}} a <b>treadmilling</b> microswimmer in a two-dimensional unbounded domain with a semi-infinite no-slip wall. The wall can also be regarded as a probe or pipette inserted into the flow. We solve the governing evolution equations in an analytical form and numerically calculate trajectories of the swimmer for several different initial positions and orientations. We then compute the probability that the <b>treadmilling</b> organism can escape the vicinity of the wall. We find that many trajectories in a 'wedge' around the wall are likely to escape. This suggests that inserting a probe or pipette in a suspension of organism may push away <b>treadmilling</b> swimmers. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figures. PDFLaTeX with IMA style (included...|$|R
