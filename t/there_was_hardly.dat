5|$|Although Hermes o Logios was {{the most}} {{important}} publication for the transmission of progressive ideas to the Greek people, which should ultimately lead to the emancipation and independence, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> any information of signs of an ongoing revolution, at least on the surface. There was the Austrian censure to be reckoned with, as the reactionary minister Klemens von Metternich and his secret police kept a very close eye on the activities of the local Greek community. The lack of items on politics, polity, law and social structures does not indicate an immanent revolution. Several editors were also members of the patriotic organization Filiki Etaireia and staunch supporters of the struggle for independence, but one can hardly maintain that this fervent patriotism is reflected in the subjects treated inside the periodical. Even in the last years, {{on the eve of the}} Greek War of Independence, in the fields of philology, sciences, philanthropy, etc., nothing out of the ordinary was published. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the contributors of Hermes o Logios dreamed of the liberation of the Greek nation and of an independent state.|$|E

25|$|Darley {{decided to}} emigrate to Australia and arrived in Sydney in 1862. He was {{admitted}} to the NSW Bar on 2 June 1862 and was later appointed a Queens Counsel (QC) in 1878. Biographer Percival Serle states that Darley had established a good practice, and that for the twenty years preceding his elevation to the bench, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> an important case at Sydney in which he did not appear on one side or the other. Biographer John Bennett, on the other hand, states that Darley found his early years tiring and not particularly well remunerated, and that it was Darley's zeal rather than his legal skills that brought him to attention.|$|E

25|$|Because of the {{political}} dominance of one party or the other in many states, the real political races during this period would often be within the party primary. Indeed, in many southern states, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> any Republican Party at all, and the serious candidates of both the conservative and liberal kind were all Democrats. For example, in the southern states the race might be between a populist left-wing Democrat and a conservative Democrat in the primary, while in {{regions of the country}} such as the Midwest or New England in which the Republican Party was dominant, the race might be decided in the primary between a progressive Republican and a conservative Republican.|$|E
25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War I in 1914, the yeshiva moved from Mir to Poltava, Ukraine. Following the death of Rabbi Kamai in 1917, Rav Eliezer Yehuda was appointed as rosh yeshiva, ushering in {{the golden age of}} the yeshiva. In 1921, The yeshiva moved back to its original facilities in Mir, where it blossomed, attracting the cream of the yeshiva students. The yeshiva's reputation grew, attracting students not only from throughout Europe, but also from America, South Africa and Australia, and the student body grew to close to 500. By the time World War II broke out <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> a rosh yeshiva of the Lithuanian school who had not studied in Mir. During this period Rabbi Yeruchom Levovitz joined the yeshiva as mashgiach in succession to Rabbi Zalman Dolinski.|$|E
25|$|Tarmo {{was officially}} {{commissioned}} on 4 January 1908. Leonard Melán {{was replaced by}} Captain Johan Rosqvist, an experienced winter navigator known {{for his ability to}} predict the movements of ice fields with almost supernatural accuracy. However, the winter of 1908 was relatively mild and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> any ice to break before the end of February. When the icebreaking capability of the new vessel could finally be assessed, it was found out that the new ship was not as maneuverable as the smaller and less powerful Sampo, and the changes made to the original design did not improve her performance. However, despite the shortcomings Tarmo was still a valuable addition to the state-owned icebreaker fleet, and after a number of changes her icebreaking characteristics were in par with Sampo.|$|E

25|$|A {{distinctive}} {{trait of}} the Dutch economy {{emerging in the}} 18th century was the fiscal-financial complex. The historically large public debt, resulting from the Republic's participation in the European wars {{around the turn of}} the 18th century, was held by a small percentage of the Dutch population (<b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> any external debt). This implied that the Dutch fiscal system now became yoked to the service of this debt in a way that served the interests of this small rentier class. No less than 70 percent of the annual revenue of the province of Holland (the main debtor) had to be dedicated to debt service. These revenues consisted mainly of regressive indirect taxes with the perverse effect that income was transferred from the poorer classes to the richer to the amount of 14 million guilders a year (approximately 7 percent of the Gross National Product at the time). This debt burden rested preponderantly on the tax payers from Holland, as the finances of the provinces were separated in the confederal system of the Republic, and this unequal debt burden militated against other provinces agreeing to fiscal reform. Fiscal reform was also opposed by the rentiers that had a vested interest in retaining their interest income, but not in paying (direct) income taxes to pay for the debt service.|$|E
25|$|Back in 2001 the ICC {{decided to}} create a plan {{designed}} to make all ICC full member countries play each other for Test cricket {{over a period of}} ten years (known as the ICC Ten Year Plan). This was approved in February 2001 by the ICC member countries. Starting from 2002 and running until 2011, it ensured that each Test country played the other nine home and away over a period of ten years, in addition to any matches the individual cricket boards organised on their own. Thus, India and Pakistan played 12 ODIs and 6 Tests against each other in their respective countries (not including neutral ground ODI tournaments such as the Asia Cup) from 2004 to April 2005, and played a further series of 3 Tests and 5 ODIs in the winter of 2006. However, because of the rigorous schedule of the Ten Year Plan, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> any time left over to schedule other series, and there were voices criticising the amount of international cricket that is played, with the risk of injury and player burnout as reasons for why this amount should be reduced. The ICC defended their policy, citing the number of international players in English county cricket as a sign that there was not too much cricket for the players.|$|E
500|$|Historian Nicholas Rodger called Edward III's {{claim to}} be the [...] "Sovereign of the Seas" [...] into question, arguing <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> any Royal Navy before the reign of Henry V (1413–22). Despite Rodger's view, King John had already {{developed}} a royal fleet of galleys and had attempted to establish an administration for these ships and ones which were arrested (privately owned ships pulled into royal/national service). Henry III, his successor, continued this work. Notwithstanding the fact that he, along with his predecessor, had hoped to develop a strong and efficient naval administration, their endeavours produced one that was informal and mostly ad hoc. A formal naval administration emerged during Edward's reign which was composed of lay administrators and headed by William de Clewre, Matthew de Torksey, and John de Haytfield successively with them being titled Clerk of the King's Ships. Sir Robert de Crull was the last to fill this position during Edward III's reign and would have the longest tenure in this position. It was during his tenure that Edward's naval administration would become a base for what evolved during the reigns of successors such as Henry VIII's Council of Marine and Navy Board and Charles I's Board of Admiralty. Rodger also argues that for much of the fourteenth century, the French had the upper hand, apart from Sluys in 1340 and, perhaps, off Winchelsea in 1350. Yet, the French never invaded England and France's King John II died in captivity in England. There was a need for an English navy {{to play a role in}} this and to handle other matters, such as the insurrection of the Anglo-Irish lords and acts of piracy.|$|E
