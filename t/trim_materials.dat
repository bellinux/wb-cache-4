Alpha cabin and impedance tube were used to measure the random and normal sound absorption coefficients respectively. The computer model based on SEA method was then validated with the experiment in order to obtain correlation between simulation and measurement. The prediction of normal sound absorptions was found to be in acceptable agreement with its corresponding test data, while prediction of random sound absorptions showed a relatively poor correlation with the test data.

40|$|In the {{automotive}} industry indoor air quality or Vehicle Indoor Air Quality (VIAQ) are caused by various substances emitted from interior materials inside a vehicle. The volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are an example of emitted substances from the interior materials which is harmful to the human body. As stated by previous researches, {{there is a strong}} correlation between the total VOCs emission and interior temperature. This occurs due to the solar radiation through the back window glasses, windscreen and side window glasses. This trapped heat can accelerate the melting process of <b>trim</b> <b>materials</b> such as hard plastic and rubber, thus causing the emission of total VOCs (TVOCs). Therefore, reducing the percentage of visible light transmittance (VLT) will help to reduce radiation process. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect of VLT level on TVOCs emission in the vehicle cabin under static condition (parked and unventilated) and operating condition (driving and air-conditioned). For static condition the result shows that the TVOCs concentration linearly decreases whenever the percentage of VLT level decreases.

40|$|Over recent years, in the {{automotive}} field, numerous performance and aesthetic innovations {{have been produced}} thanks to the development process of the manufacturing technologies gained mainly in the aerospace industrial context. The automotive industry is currently experiencing relevant technology changes {{in the design of}} the engines, transmission and total drivetrain, induced by increasing customer demand for fuel efficiency and more stringent government requirements in emissions and safety. One of the problems relating to environmental impact concerns the noise emitted by the vehicle, for which various solutions have been experimented: new and more resistant materials have been worked out in order to minimize noise pollution and the environmental impact of the vehicle, even at the end of the operating life of its components. Several research programs are currently running or recently terminated worldwide to explore the feasibility of smart materials. The increasingly dominant role of lightweight materials in many technological sectors is motivated by the multitude of benefits that they could offer like the weight optimization and the reduction of the fuel burn and noise levels. This research illustrates a solution as a response to those requirements, as well as being a response to the targets of comfort: a viscoelastic material, appointed to increase the damping of structures involved in vibro-acoustic phenomena generated in a vehicle. The performance of these innovative materials have been analyzed both from a numerical standpoint that experimental. Static mechanical properties and modal parameters carried out in the laboratory, pertinent to each configuration were arranged into a rational database for further studies on the vibro-acoustic behaviour of the coupled cavity-structure system.

40|$|Reducing {{the very}} {{annoying}} boom noise which is heard inside the cabin of a moving vehicle is the motivation {{and the subject}} of this research thesis. The attraction of a vehicle to a potential consumer is significantly influenced by its interior noise characteristics. Thus the prediction of vehicle interior noise is a significant challenge for vehicle manufacturers at the early concept design phase. Vehicular interior noise mainly stems from structural vibration such as the power train, driveline vibration or wheel vibration which is induced by road roughness. Among numerous vehicular noise problems, structural-borne noise such as boom noise is considered to have the most annoying acoustic features. The boom noise influences the acoustic quality, and thus the customer&rsquo;s perception of the car for the value and quality. The boom noise generated from structural vibration is mainly due to the strong modal coupling between the flexible structure and the acoustic cavity. Therefore, studying the vibro-acoustic coupling characteristics &ndash; the subject of this research &ndash; is important for car manufacturers. In this research, the first step was to perform experimental modal analysis to identify the plate-cavity resonance problem. Following this, the Finite Element Method (ANSYS) was applied to simulate the plate and cavity system and the simulation results were compared with experimental results; these new results have formed the basis for later analytical formulations and assumptions. Secondly, the deterministic method, based on an Impedance Mobility Compact Matrix, was implemented in the analytical solution to calculate the sound pressure level inside the acoustic cavity and the flexible plate vibration velocity. The analytical results were verified by the results of the VAOne vibro-acoustic simulation model and experimental results. A statistical energy analysis (SEA) was then applied to simulate the plate and cavity system. All SEA parameters were calibrated with analytical formulae and the coupling quotient calculated. The coupling quotient indicated the coupling strength of the plate-cavity system in the mid-high frequency ranges. Then the two methods were combined. The use of the combined method produced results which explained how the air cavity and the flexible structure were coupled in the low-mid frequency ranges. The acoustic pressure calculated by the Impedance Mobility method was used to predict the mean energies of the flexible plate and the cavity. The predicted mean energy curves were verified by the SEA simulation results using the AutoSEA software and experimental data from speaker-microphone experiments. The results from the combined methods have revealed that the coupling between the structure and the acoustic cavity depends on the plate thickness and the cavity size. This study provides a better insight into the coupling strength of the plate structure and the cavity. It is this insight which can be used to understand and solve the boom noise problem. The effect of interior <b>trim</b> <b>materials</b> on the sound quality of the plate-cavity system was also investigated. The sound pressure results calculated by the impedance mobility method were used to calculate the psychoacoustic metrics using the psychoacoustic analysis method. Experiments were carried out on a simply supported aluminium plate which covered an open ended square box, and the box was excited by a shaker. A good agreement between the analytical and experimental results was obtained, and the proposed model was validated and confirmed for feasibility. The results indicated that the interior trim has an influence on the distribution of the sound loudness and sharpness inside the cavity in the middle and high frequency ranges. Finally, the application of the hybrid deterministic-SEA method to predict the sound pressure level and mean energy level responses of the stiffened plate-cavity system was demonstrated. The mean square sound pressure inside the acoustic cavity for nine observation points was averaged and used as an input to calculate the cavity mean energy. A good agreement between analytical and experimental results was obtained, and the proposed method was validated and confirmed for feasibility. The results of the proposed method were also validated by practical engineering applications. It was found that there was a strong coupling between the stiffened bare plate and cavity. This can be demonstrated by the first resonant frequency peak overlap of the stiffened plate and the acoustic cavity. The strength of coupling was found to be reduced by adding the stiffener onto the plate, or increasing the thickness of the plate. A strong coupling of the plate and cavity would induce a high level of boom noise. Overall, the results of this research have shed new insights onto the boom noise and its solution which helps to eliminate this most annoying noise phenomenon. Much more research, however, still needs to be undertaken in order to fully resolve this noise issue...|$|E
