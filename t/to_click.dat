5|$|Vampire: The Masquerade – Redemption—shortened to Redemption—is a {{role-playing}} game (RPG) presented {{primarily from}} the third-person perspective; the playable character is shown on the screen while an optional first-person mode used to view the character's immediate environment is available. The camera can be freely rotated around the character and positioned above it to give a greater overview of the immediate area. The game follows a linear, mission-based structure. Interaction is achieved by using a mouse <b>to</b> <b>click</b> on an enemy or environmental object to attack it or to activate it. Interaction is context based; clicking on an enemy initiates combat, while clicking on a door causes it to open or close.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a long shot {{of a group of}} dancers who have just {{finished}} rehearsing a dance routine. As the dancers walk out of view, Rihanna walks onto the middle of the floor, where the singer turns, and faces the camera, and closes her eyes. Standing still, Rihanna begins <b>to</b> <b>click</b> her fingers, whereby the screen begins to cut between a scene of Rihanna, who is noticeably in a different setting, and black fades. As the song's audio begins to play, it becomes apparent that the setting has changed from a rehearsal studio into a nightclub, which Rihanna in the centre. The scene is fairly dark with different colour lights projected into different areas of the nightclub, as dancers infiltrate the dance floor surrounding Rihanna. This scene is used for the first verse-chorus-verse part of the song, but changes to a scene of Rihanna, accompanied by several dancers, situated in a gym locker room for the second chorus. For the bridge, the scene changes back to Rihanna in the nightclub, but this time in a different change of attire. This scene is used for the final chorus. The video ends with a close-up of Rihanna in the nightclub standing still as the audio finishes, where she closes her eyes, which prompts the scene to change back to Rihanna {{in the middle of the}} rehearsal studio from the beginning of the video, to which she walks out of view of the camera.|$|E

25|$|GROW is {{a series}} of Flash-based puzzle games created by On, a Japanese indie game developer, and posted to his website, eyezmaze.com. The series, which was {{launched}} on February 7, 2002, comprises 12 full games, 7 minigames, and 1 canceled game. The most recently released title was published in October 2016. The games all feature a simple click-button interface requiring the player to determine the correct combination of buttons <b>to</b> <b>click</b> to maximize visual reward and ultimately to achieve the good ending. Graphically spare and minimalist, GROW games employ a cute aesthetic and often include creatures and characters taken from On's other games like those in the Tontie Series.|$|E
25|$|Players {{typically}} {{navigate the}} game world from a first or third-person perspective in 3D RPGs. However, an isometric or aerial top-down perspective {{is common in}} party-based RPGs, {{in order to give}} the player a clear view of their entire party and their surroundings. Role-playing games require the player to manage a large amount of information, and frequently make use of a windowed interface. For example, spell-casting characters will often have a menu of spells they can use. On the PC, players typically use the mouse <b>to</b> <b>click</b> on icons and menu options, while console games have the player navigate through menus using a game controller. Older games often revealed calculations of the game as seen in Dungeons & Dragons games, although more recent games have removed this information to improve immersion.|$|E

40|$|Basilar {{membrane}} responses <b>to</b> <b>clicks</b> and <b>to</b> {{white noise}} were recorded using laser velocimetry at basal {{sites of the}} chinchilla cochlea with characteristic frequencies near 10  kHz. Responses to noise grew at compressive rates and their instantaneous frequencies decreased with increasing stimulus level. First-order Wiener kernels were computed by cross-correlation of the noise stimuli and the responses. For linear systems, first-order Wiener kernels are identical to unit impulse responses. In the case of basilar membrane responses, first-order Wiener kernels and responses <b>to</b> <b>clicks</b> measured at the same sites were similar but not identical. Both consisted of transient oscillations with onset frequencies which increased rapidly, over about 0. 5  ms, from 4 – 5  kHz to the characteristic frequency. Both first-order Wiener kernels and responses <b>to</b> <b>clicks</b> were more highly damped, exhibited slower frequency modulation, and grew at compressive rates with increasing stimulus levels. Responses <b>to</b> <b>clicks</b> had longer durations than the Wiener kernels. The statistical distribution of basilar membrane responses to Gaussian white noise is also Gaussian and the envelopes of the responses are Rayleigh distributed, {{as they should be}} for Gaussian noise passing through a linear band-pass filter. Accordingly, basilar membrane responses were accurately predicted by linear filters specified by the first-order Wiener kernels of responses to noise presented at the same level. Overall, the results indicate that cochlear nonlinearity is not instantaneous and resembles automatic gain control...|$|R
25|$|Several {{phishing}} {{attacks have}} been directed specifically at senior executives and other high-profile targets within businesses, and the term whaling has been coined for {{these kinds of}} attacks. In the case of whaling, the masquerading web page/email will take a more serious executive-level form. The content will be crafted to target an upper manager and the person's role in the company. The content of a whaling attack email is often written as a legal subpoena, customer complaint, or executive issue. Whaling scam emails are designed to masquerade as a critical business email, sent from a legitimate business authority. The content is meant to be tailored for upper management, and usually involves some kind of falsified company-wide concern. Whaling phishers have also forged official-looking FBI subpoena emails, and claimed that the manager needs <b>to</b> <b>click</b> a link and install special software to view the subpoena.|$|E
25|$|Om a Tuesday {{night at}} Memphis, the Cougars {{initially}} looked like their offense was finally starting <b>to</b> <b>click</b> when Solawa {{drove down the}} field and crossed a pass into the box, where Jambga slotted it past the Tigers' keeper for the season's first SIUE score {{from the field and}} the 1–0 lead in the 12th minute. After falling behind, the hosts from the American Athletic Conference shifted into a higher attack gear. Memphis took shot after shot, nut the Cougar defense and keeper Dal Santo held firm well into the second half. Although Memphis committed more fouls and was given four second-half yellow cards, it was SIUE who was called for a foul inside the box, setting up the penalty kick that tied the game in the 77th minute. Having never won at Memphis, the Cougars would have settled for a draw, but, as the clock wound down, the Tigers took a shot off a crossing pass, and the SIUE block was directed past Dal Santo with only nine seconds left in the game.|$|E
25|$|Lau et al. {{set up an}} {{experiment}} where subjects would look at an analogue-style clock, and a red dot would move around the screen. Subjects were told <b>to</b> <b>click</b> the mouse button whenever they felt the intention to do so. One group was given a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulse, {{and the other was}} given a sham TMS. Subjects in the intention condition were told to move the cursor to where it was when they felt the inclination to press the button. In the movement condition, subjects moved their cursor to where it was when they physically pressed the button. Results showed the TMS was able to shift the perceived intention forward by 16ms, and shifted back the 14ms for the movement condition. Perceived intention could be manipulated up to 200ms after the execution of the spontaneous action, indicating that the perception of intention occurred after the executive motor movements. Often it is thought that free will were to exist, it would require intention to be the causal source of behavior. These results show that intention may not be the causal source of all behavior.|$|E

With less than a minute left in the game, Halzle completed a 47-yard pass to Juaquin Iglesias that set up a 9-yard touchdown pass to Johnson to bring the Sooners within seven points. The Sooners attempted an onside kick with 20seconds remaining but Tech got the ball and ran out the clock.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{auditory}} Event-Related Potentials (ERP) of component P 50 {{to sound}} onset and offset {{have been reported}} to be similar, but their magnetic homologue has been reported absent to sound offset. We compared the spatio-temporal distribution of cortical activity during P 50 to sound onset and offset, without confounds of spectral change. Methods: ERPs were recorded in response to onsets and offsets of silent intervals of 0. 5 s (gaps) appearing randomly in otherwise continuous white noise and compared to ERPs <b>to</b> randomly distributed <b>click</b> pairs with half second separation presented in silence. Subjects were awake and distracted from the stimuli by reading a complicated text. Measures of P 50 included peak latency and amplitude, as well as source current density estimates <b>to</b> the <b>clicks</b> and sound onsets and offsets. Results: P 50 occurred in response to noise onsets and <b>to</b> <b>clicks,</b> while <b>to</b> noise offset it was absent. Latency of P 50 was similar to noise onset (56 ms) and <b>to</b> <b>clicks</b> (53 ms). Sources of P 50 to noise onsets and clicks included bilateral superior parietal areas. In contrast, noise offsets activated left inferior temporal and occipital areas at the time of P 50. Source current density was significantly higher to noise onset than offset {{in the vicinity of the}} temporo-parietal junction. Conclusions: P 50 to sound offset is absent compared to the distinct P 50 to sound onset and <b>to</b> <b>clicks,</b> at different intracranial sources. P 50 to stimulus onset and <b>to</b> <b>clicks</b> appears <b>to</b> reflect preattentive arousal by a new sound in the scene. Sound offset does not involve a new sound and hence the absent P 50. Significance: Stimulus onset activates distinct early cortical processes that are absent to offset. © 2007 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology...|$|R
