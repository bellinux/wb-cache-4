5|$|Coolbrith's nephew Henry Frank Peterson came <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> at the library, {{and began}} to {{organize}} the books into a faceted classification scheme that she specified, one which used one- and two-digit numbers to stand for general subjects, and three-digit numbers to indicate individual books in that subject. Before this, Coolbrith had resisted library trustee attempts to classify the books; she had wished to continue the reading-room atmosphere that she had established.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, Fonda {{starred in}} 9 to 5 with Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton. The film {{was a huge}} {{critical}} and box office success, becoming the second highest-grossing release of the year. Fonda had long wanted <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> father, hoping it would help their strained relationship. She achieved this goal when she purchased the screen rights to the play On Golden Pond, specifically for her father and her. On Golden Pond, which also starred Katharine Hepburn, brought Henry Fonda his only Academy Award for Best Actor, which Jane accepted on his behalf, as he was ill and could not leave home. He died five months later.|$|E
5|$|Patricia Jones {{never made}} it to her house that evening, {{according}} to her husband. Walter Jones filed a missing persons report with police the next day and began calling people he thought might have seen his wife. He got a lead when he spoke to friends of Patricia's who carpooled <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>her.</b> The friends told Jones that Patricia had reported receiving a phone call that day from an unnamed woman who wanted to meet with her. She had asked the carpool driver to drop her off at a street corner in Independence, which he had done. The occupants of the carpool had seen a woman waiting for Jones in another car at the shop but did not recognize her. They nevertheless provided a description of the unknown woman to Jones.|$|E
5|$|The {{post-production}} {{schedule for}} Up in the Air was shorter than Jason Reitman's previous two films. The editing team had only 16 to 17 weeks post-schedule, whereas an editing deadline is usually from 22 to 26 weeks. Reitman {{was involved in}} post-production while shooting. The film was shot entirely on location and Glauberman stayed in Los Angeles to cut. She would send him scenes every day or every other day as she finished them, and he would view them.

5|$|As her fame grew, Coffin {{gained the}} {{opportunity}} to put her design principles into practice on a larger scale. Her practice had grown large {{enough for her to}} need an assistant by 1911, and by 1918 she had moved her office to larger premises at 830 Lexington Avenue. She also took on James Scheiner, an architect, as an associate. He became a key part of Coffin's practice, working on large-scale tasks such as overseeing work on the ground. This in turn opened up new opportunities for her to take on new, larger commissions. Coffin insisted on being paid the same fees as a male architect and to be treated equally in contracts; this was a novelty in itself, at a time when women were usually paid less than men. She also liked to employ women <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> on commissions, giving them the chance to undertake apprenticeships that male prejudice had denied her when she had first started on her career.|$|E
5|$|After the Nuremberg rallies trilogy and Olympia, Riefenstahl {{began work}} on the movie she had {{tried and failed to}} direct once before, namely Tiefland. On Hitler's direct order, the German {{government}} paid her seven million Reichsmarks in compensation. From 23 September until 13 November 1940, she filmed in Krün near Mittenwald. The extras playing Spanish women and farmers were drawn from gypsies detained in a camp at Salzburg-Maxglan who were forced <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>her.</b> Filming at the Babelsberg Studios near Berlin began 18 months later in April 1942. This time Sinti and Roma people from the Marzahn detention camp near Berlin were compelled to work as extras. Almost to the end of her life, despite overwhelming evidence that the concentration camp occupants had been forced to work on the movie unpaid, Riefenstahl continued to maintain all the film extras survived and that she had met several of them after the war. Riefenstahl sued filmmaker Nina Gladitz, who said Riefenstahl personally chose the extras at their holding camp; Gladitz had found one of the Gypsy survivors and matched his memory with stills of the movie for a documentary Gladitz was filming. The German court ruled largely in favour of Gladitz, declaring that Riefenstahl had known the extras were from a concentration camp, but they also agreed that Riefenstahl had not been informed the Gypsies would be sent to Auschwitz after filming was completed.|$|E
