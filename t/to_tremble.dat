Naomi unknowingly dates a married man in an attempt to get over Liam, who shows up at West Beverly {{on the first day of}} school after being absent for the entire summer. Silver and Dixon get back together, but break up when he finds out Silver kissed Ethan. It is also {{revealed}} that Ethan has decided to stay in Montana with his father. Adrianna is desperate to become a normal teenager, giving up acting, and, much to Navid's dismay, their relationship is put under further pressure with the arrival of Teddy Montgomery, Adrianna's ex-boyfriend (to whom Adrianna lost her virginity). Meanwhile, the emotionally distant and guilt-ridden Annie has cut herself from society as much as possible, contributing to a growing discord between her and her brother, who is angry at her for sending him to summer school. Annie begins to date Jasper, which began as a guilt-ridden friendship but later turned into a relationship. Jasper is different from any other boy Annie has dated. He is more quiet and mysterious compared to her past boyfriends. Dixon meets a girl named Sasha when he begins his DJing career and is performing near her in a yacht, to whom he lies about his real age. Navid and Adrianna's relationship continues <b>to</b> <b>tremble</b> when Adrianna continues to find Teddy alluring. In the meantime, Harry and Debbie face marital problems when Harry confides to Kelly about his family troubles.

Sasha finally learns about Dixon's real age when Debbie accidentally shows Sasha, whom she met by chance in a salon and does not know, a picture of her son Dixon who is only in high school.|$|E

500|$|Sandy George from Australian Screen Online {{said that}} Vidler's long {{career as an}} actor helped him [...] "draw the terrific performances" [...] from the film's young actors. 17-year-old Laurence Breuls was {{literally}} {{the first person to}} audition for the role of Jared. Hundred of others auditioned though Breuls remained the favourite choice. Vidler chose Simon Lyndon, who played the role of Jared in the original stage production of Blackrock, for the role of Ricko, stating that Lyndon had the looks, charisma, and complexity to play the role. Rebecca Smart, who also portrayed Cherie in the original stage production, was the only person to reprise their role from the play. Blackrock is often considered to be Heath Ledger's debut film, but he had an uncredited minor role in the 1991 film Clowning Around. While Ledger's role in Blackrock is small, it is credited with garnering him attention in Australia, leading to more prominent acting roles. 15-year-old Bojana Novakovic was given the role of Tracy partly because she was a competitive gymnast and was considered mentally and physically strong enough to film the rape scene. Vidler discussed the role with her parents before filming commenced, who despite initial reservations, eventually gave permission for her to film the scene. Novakovic said the experience was traumatic and she began <b>to</b> <b>tremble</b> uncontrollably once the shoot ended, though recovered shortly afterwards, concluding, [...] "In a way, I feel lucky to have had such a role at the beginning of my career. I don't think I'll ever be scared by an emotional scene again." [...] The boys involved in the scene showed up at her door the following day and gave her a bunch of flowers and a T-shirt that said [...] "shit happens". Vidler said he found the performance so powerful that when he first watched the rushes of the scene alone, he burst into tears.|$|E

His usual answer to a question was: [...] "We have learned it in the Mishnah or in a baraita" [...] (B. M. 90a; Yoma 48b).

[...] McGee continued, relating that most of the ministers were already gathered outside the meeting house while the people remained seated inside, unwilling to leave, when his brother, William, “felt such a power come on him that he quit his seat and sat down in the floor of the pulpit." [...] John McGee began <b>to</b> <b>tremble</b> as weeping erupted through the congregation. [...] The woman in the east end began to shout again and McGee started toward her just as someone reminded him that his Presbyterian hosts were “much for order” and would not “hear this confusion; go back and be quiet." [...] McGee turned to go back and was “near falling” when he changed his mind and “went through the house shouting and exhorting with all possible ecstasy and energy." [...] Using the term that came to be associated with the revival phenomenon of collapsing in a state of physical helplessness, McGee continued: [...] “The floor was soon covered with the slain; their screams for mercy pierced the heavens.” ...|$|E

He declared that trade {{should continue to}} remain open, sent emissaries to Elliot, and began to gather military assets outside Canton. The Qing army camped outside of the city soon numbered 50,000, and the money earned from the reopened trade was spent repairing and expanding Canton's defenses. Concealed artillery batteries were built along the Pear River, Chinese soldiers were deployed in Whampoa and the Bocca Tigris, and hundreds of small river craft were armed for war. [...] A bulletin sent from the Daoguang Emperor commanded the Qing forces to [...] "Exterminate the rebels at all points," [...] and orders were given to drive the British from the Pearl River before reclaiming Hong Kong and driving the invaders out of China altogether. This order was leaked and became widely circulated in Canton among foreign merchants, who were already suspicious of Chinese intentions after learning of the Qing military buildup. In May many Cohong merchants and their families left the city, raising further concerns about a renewal of hostilities. Rumors spread that Chinese divers were being trained to drill holes in the hulls of British ships, and that fleets of fire rafts were being prepared for deployment against the Royal Navy. During the buildup the Qing army was weakened by infighting between units and {{lack of confidence in}} Yishan, who openly distrusted Cantonese civilians and soldiers, instead choosing to rely on forces drawn from other Chinese provinces. On 20 May Yishan issued a statement, asking the [...] "people of Canton, and all foreign merchants who are respectfully obedient, not <b>to</b> <b>tremble</b> with alarm and be frightened out of their wits at the military hosts that are gathering around, there being no probability of hostilities."

2500|$|Chosen by Empress Dowager Cixi on her deathbed, Puyi became emperor {{at the age}} of 2years and 10months in December1908 {{after the}} Guangxu Emperor died on 14November. Titled the Xuantong Emperor (Wade-Giles: Hsuan-tung Emperor), Puyi's {{introduction}} to the life of an emperor began when palace officials arrived at his family residence to take him. On the evening of 13November 1908, without any advance notice, a procession of eunuchs and guardsmen led by the palace chamberlain left the Forbidden City for the Northern Mansion to inform Prince Chun that they were taking away his three-year-old son Puyi to be the new emperor. The toddler Puyi screamed and resisted as the officials ordered the eunuch attendants to pick him up. Puyi's parents said nothing when they learned that they were losing their son. As Puyi cried, screaming {{that he did not want}} to leave his parents, he was forced into a palanquin that took him back to the Forbidden City. Puyi's wet nurse Wang Wen-Chao was the only person from the Northern Mansion allowed to go with him, and she calmed the very distraught Puyi down by allowing him to suckle one of her breasts; this was the only reason why she was taken along as only she could calm Puyi down. Upon arriving at the Forbidden City, Puyi was taken to see the Dowager Empress Cixi. Puyi later wrote: I still have a dim recollection of this meeting, the shock of which left a deep impression on my memory. I remember suddenly finding myself surrounded by strangers, while before me was hung a drab curtain through which I could see an emaciated and terrifying hideous face. This was Cixi. It is said that I burst out into loud howls at the sight and started <b>to</b> <b>tremble</b> uncontrollably. Cixi told someone to give me some sweets, but I threw them on the floor and yelled [...] "I want nanny, I want nanny", to her great displeasure. [...] "What a naughty child" [...] she said. [...] "Take him away to play." [...] His father, Prince Chun, became Prince Regent (摄政王). During Puyi's coronation in the Hall of Supreme Harmony on 2December 1908, the young emperor was carried onto the Dragon Throne by his father. Puyi was so frightened by the scene before him and the deafening sounds of ceremonial drums and music that he started crying. His father could do nothing except to quietly comfort him: [...] "Don't cry, it'll be over soon." ...|$|E
