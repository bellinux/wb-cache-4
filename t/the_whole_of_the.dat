5|$|According to the Bills of Mortality, {{there were}} in total 68,596 deaths in London from the plague in 1665. Lord Clarendon {{estimated}} that the true number of mortalities was probably twice that figure. The next year, 1666, saw further deaths in other cities but on a lesser scale. Dr Thomas Gumble, chaplain to the Duke of Albermarle, both of whom had stayed in London for <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epidemic, estimated that the total death count for the country from plague during 1665 and 1666 was about 200,000.|$|E
5|$|As before, the MPGA {{supported}} and assisted the new fundraising campaign. However, although {{the campaign was}} initially boosted by a £1,000 donation from Octavia Hill, fundraising was slow, and by October 1898 only £2,000 had been raised.

5|$|As the new {{residential}} area suffered from aircraft noise, residents {{joined in the}} demand that the airport be relocated. Despite this, the number of flights to the airport increased as the newly formed Israel Airports Authority strived to reduce congestion at Ben Gurion Airport by shifting all domestic turbo-prop flights to Sde Dov. Once again, the only feasible alternative proposed at this point was to build a runway in the sea and again, {{the high cost of}} this project meant that it never happened.

5|$|At six storeys, the Great Southern Hotel was {{the first}} Chinese hotel to have a lift. The {{original}} design accommodated offices on the first storey, the hotel on {{the second and third}} storeys, a restaurant on the fifth storey, and a tea house on the roof terrace as well as a cabaret. The restaurant on the fourth floor was later converted into the owner's office. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fifth floor was occupied by a then-well-known cabaret, the Southern Cabaret. Shops and entertainment outlets, including a Hainanese kopitiam, were situated on the ground floor.|$|E
5|$|Between 1774 and 1797 {{a series}} of {{enclosures}} {{took place in the}} Brue valley between the Poldens and Wedmore.

Work by the Commissioners of Sewers led to the 1801 Brue Drainage Act which enabled sections at Highbridge and Cripp's Bridge to be straightened, and new feeder channels such as the North and South Drains to be constructed. In 1803 the clyse at Highbridge, which had been built before 1485, was replaced and moved further downstream.|$|E

On 11 May 330, Constantinople was proclaimed {{the capital of the}} Roman Empire, which was later permanently divided between the two sons of Theodosius I upon his death on 17 January 395, when the city became the capital of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire.|$|E
5|$|During sexual arousal, the {{clitoris}} and <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genitalia engorge {{and change}} {{color as the}} erectile tissues fill with blood (vasocongestion), and the individual experiences vaginal contractions. The ischiocavernosus and bulbocavernosus muscles, which insert into the corpora cavernosa, contract and compress the dorsal vein of the clitoris (the only vein that drains the blood from the spaces in the corpora cavernosa) and the arterial blood continues a steady flow and, having no way to drain out, fills the venous spaces until they become turgid and engorged with blood. This is what leads to clitoral erection.|$|E

5|$|From 1782 onwards, {{the city}} was {{reshaped}} with large-scale civil engineering projects aimed at merging all the seven islands into a single amalgamated mass.

5|$|Historically Bournemouth {{was part}} of Hampshire, with {{neighbouring}} Poole, just {{to the west of}} the border, in Dorset. At the time of the 1974 local government re-organisation, it was considered desirable that <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Poole/Bournemouth urban area should be part of the same county. Bournemouth therefore became part of the non-metropolitan county of Dorset on 1 April 1974. On 1 April 1997, Bournemouth became a unitary authority, independent from Dorset County Council. For the purposes of the Lieutenancy it remains part of the ceremonial county of Dorset.|$|E
