25|$|In {{addition}} to the levels of insulation provide by {{the structure of the}} building, the DER also takes into account the airtightness of the building, the efficiency of space and water heating, the efficiency of lighting, and any savings from solar power or other energy generation <b>technologies</b> <b>employed,</b> and other factors. For the first time, it also became compulsory to upgrade the energy efficiency in existing houses when extensions or certain other works are carried out.|$|E
25|$|While the {{practices}} or <b>technologies</b> <b>employed</b> in green building are constantly evolving and {{may differ from}} region to region, fundamental principles persist from which the method is derived: siting and structure design efficiency, energy efficiency, water efficiency, materials efficiency, indoor environmental quality enhancement, operations and maintenance optimization and waste and toxics reduction. The essence of green building is an optimization {{of one or more}} of these principles. Also, with the proper synergistic design, individual green building technologies may work together to produce a greater cumulative effect.|$|E

25|$|Transducer <b>technologies</b> <b>employed</b> {{much less}} {{commonly}} for headphones include the Heil Air Motion Transformer (AMT); Piezoelectric film; Ribbon planar magnetic; Magnetostriction and Plasma-ionisation. The first Heil AMT headphone was marketed by ESS Laboratories and was essentially an ESS AMT tweeter {{from one of}} the company's speakers being driven at full range. Since the turn of the century, only Precide of Switzerland have manufactured an AMT headphone. Piezoelectric film headphones were first developed by Pioneer, their two models both used a flat sheet of film which limited the maximum volume of air that could be moved. Currently TakeT produce a piezoelectric film headphone which is shaped not unlike an AMT transducer but which like the driver Precide uses for their headphones, has a variation in the size of transducer folds over the diaphragm. It additionally incorporates a two way design by its inclusion of a dedicated tweeter/supertweeter panel. The folded shape of a diaphragm allows a transducer with a larger surface area to fit within smaller space constraints. This increases the total volume of air that can be moved on each excursion of the transducer given that radiating area.|$|E
2500|$|The {{allocation}} {{decisions are}} often static in {{temporal and spatial}} dimensions, meaning that they are valid for {{extended periods of time}} (usually decades) and for large geographical regions (country wide). The usage is often set to be exclusive; each band is dedicated to a single provider, thus maintaining interference free communication. The command and control management model dates back to initial days of wireless communications, when the <b>technologies</b> <b>employed</b> required interference-free mediums for achieving acceptable quality. Thus, it is often argued that the exclusive nature of the command and control approach is an artifact of outdated [...] technologies.|$|E
2500|$|World War II {{marked a}} massive {{increase}} in the military funding of science, particularly physics. [...] In addition to the Manhattan Project and the resulting atomic bomb, British and American work on radar was widespread and ultimately highly influential {{in the course of}} the war; radar enabled detection of enemy ships and aircraft, as well as the radar-based proximity fuze. [...] Mathematical cryptography, meteorology, and rocket science were also central to the war effort, with military-funded wartime advances having a significant long-term effect on each discipline. [...] The <b>technologies</b> <b>employed</b> at the endjet aircraft, radar and proximity fuzes, and the atomic bombwere radically different from pre-war technology; military leaders came to view continued advances in technology as the critical element for success in future wars. [...] The advent of the Cold War solidified the links between military institutions and academic science, particularly in the United States and the Soviet Union, so that even during a period of nominal peace military funding continued to expand. [...] Funding spread to the social sciences as well as the natural sciences, and whole new fields, such as digital computing, were born of military patronage. [...] Following the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, military funding of science has decreased substantially, but much of the American military-scientific complex remains in place.|$|E
