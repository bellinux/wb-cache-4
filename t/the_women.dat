5|$|By 1782, the Johnsons {{had moved}} to Bryan's Station (future Lexington) in Fayette County. Johnson's mother was {{considered}} among the heroic women of the community because of her actions during Simon Girty's raid on Bryan's Station in August 1782. According to tradition, as Girty's forces surrounded the fort, the occupants discovered that they had almost no water inside to withstand a siege. Several Indians had concealed themselves near the spring outside the fort. The Kentuckians reasoned that the Indians would stay hidden until they attacked. Jemima Johnson approved a plan for <b>the</b> <b>women</b> to go alone and collect water from the spring as usual. Many men disapproved of the plan, fearing <b>the</b> <b>women</b> would be attacked and killed. However, faced with no other option they finally agreed. Shortly after sunrise, <b>the</b> <b>women</b> went to the spring and returned without incident.|$|E

The Man then orders that <b>the</b> <b>Woman</b> be branded with his mark. In response, <b>the</b> <b>Woman</b> stabs <b>the</b> Man.
