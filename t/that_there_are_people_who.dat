500|$|Hochuli's {{presence}} {{on the football field}} has created a cult following. His rise in popularity {{is believed to have been}} started by Phil Simms, a former NFL quarterback and current color commentator for the NFL on CBS, who made reference to the size of Hochuli's arms during a telecast. [...] On the Internet, websites that sell Hochuli merchandise as well as blogs with his namesake exist. He is often affectionately referred to as [...] "Hochules", a portmanteau of his last name and [...] "Hercules", in homage to his large biceps. While he is aware of his celebrity status, Hochuli does not understand it. He said in a USA Today interview, [...] "I get a kick out of the notoriety, because I'm just a referee. I'm not the players. The players are the game. They're what this is all about. I get notoriety because I explain things, and I get notoriety because I have a decent physique, which is funny because I'm a shrimp, a peewee compared to those players. Neither one of those things has anything to do with whether I'm a good referee." [...] His recognition extends to the streets, in airports, and in the courtroom. He has been approached by notable athletes such as former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Charles Barkley at the airport. [...] "It never ceases to amaze me," [...] Hochuli told the Arizona Daily Star. [...] "The number of people that will just come up to me and recognize me." [...] He appreciates the attention, saying, [...] "I enjoy the fact <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> like me as a referee. I hear from a lot of people and I enjoy that. Like anybody, I like praise. Probably because of my personality, I thrive on that more than other people." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{was no real}} consensus, {{at least}} among {{surviving}} Roman texts and epitaphs, {{of what happened to}} a person after death or the existence of an afterlife. Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia claims that most people are of the opinion that after death one returns to the non-sensing state that occurred before birth but admits, however scornfully, <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> believe in the immortality of the soul. Seneca the Younger seems to be less consistent, arguing both sides, indicating that death brings about utter annihilation while also talking about some survival of the spirit after it escapes from the prison of the body. Tacitus at the end of Agricola takes the opposite opinion to Pliny, and claims that the wise believe the spirit does not die with the body, although he may be specifically referring to the pious [...] – which harkens to the mythological idea of Elysium. It {{is important to keep in}} mind that these are the opinions of a select few well-educated elite males and may not be characteristic of all of Roman views.|$|E

I say 'with a scientific approach' because housework should be carried out as a true profession. We must not forget <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have wanted to present this work as something humiliating, but it is not. No doubt, the conditions under which this work used to be done were humiliating and sometimes they still are, even today, when domestic staff are subjected in their work to the whim of an arbitrary employer who does not guarantee their rights, and who gives them low wages and no affection... Any job that is well done is a wonderful service to society, and this is as true of domestic work as it is of the work of a professor or judge. The only work that is not a service is that of a person who works for his own self-interest...I understand that work in the home is especially important because through it so much good or harm can be done to families." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{social media}} users {{frequently}} quote, recontextualize, or remix dril tweets {{for their own}} satirical purposes, and some accounts are even exclusively dedicated to this purpose. One such account, @EveryoneIsDril, shares screenshots of tweets by other people that sound like dril's voice. Another, [...] "wint MP" [...] or @parliawint, attaches dril tweets styled like teletext closed captions to images from BBC News of British politicians and journalists speaking. Although seemingly niche, the wint MP account garnered 14,000 followers by May 2017. Tom Dissonance, the creator of wint MP, attributed the account's success to its functioning as a joke on multiple levels, and for multiple audiences: [...] "there are people who get the in-jokey references; there's a broader level of people who get politics and dril, and understand the significance of one commenting on another; and beyond <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> just appreciate an official figure in a suit saying something ridiculous.

6000|$|There {{is another}} thing to which I wish to ask {{attention}} {{for a little while}} on this occasion. What has always been the evidence brought forward to prove that the Republican party is a sectional party? The main one was that in the Southern portion of the Union the people did not let the Republicans proclaim their doctrines amongst them. That has been the main evidence brought forward,--that they had no supporters, or substantially none, in the Slave States. The South have not taken hold of our principles as we announce them; nor does Judge Douglas now grapple with those principles. We have a Republican State Platform, laid down in Springfield in June last stating our position {{all the way through the}} questions before the country. We are now far advanced in this canvass. Judge Douglas and I have made perhaps forty speeches apiece, and we have now for the fifth time met face to face in debate, and up to this day I have not found either Judge Douglas or any friend of his taking hold of the Republican platform, or laying his finger upon anything in it that is wrong. I ask you all to recollect that. Judge Douglas turns away from the platform of principles to the fact that he can find people somewhere who will not allow us to announce those principles. If he had great confidence that our principles were wrong, he would take hold of them and demonstrate them to be wrong. But he does not do so. The only evidence he has of their being wrong is in the fact <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> won't allow us to preach them. I ask again, is that the way to test the soundness of a doctrine? ...|$|E
6000|$|I am {{not saying}} this by way of disparagement. There is reason in things. You can't make a 50,000 ton ship as strong as a Huntley and Palmer biscuit-tin. But there is also reason in the way one accepts facts, and I refuse to be awed {{by the size of}} a tank bigger than any other tank that ever went afloat to its doom. The people {{responsible}} for her, though disconcerted in their hearts by the exposure of that disaster, are giving themselves airs of superiority--priests of an Oracle which has failed, but still must remain the Oracle. The assumption is that they are ministers of progress. But the mere increase of size is not progress. If it were, elephantiasis, which causes a man's legs to become as large as tree-trunks, would be a sort of progress, whereas it is nothing but a very ugly disease. Yet directly this very disconcerting catastrophe happened, the servants of the silly Oracle began to cry: [...] "It's no use! You can't resist progress. The big ship has come to stay." [...] Well, let her stay on, then, in God's name! But she isn't a servant of progress in any sense. She is the servant of commercialism. For progress, if dealing with the problems of a material world, has some sort of moral aspect--if only, say, that of conquest, which has its distinct value since man is a conquering animal. But bigness is mere exaggeration. The men responsible for these big ships have been moved by considerations of profit to be made by the questionable means of pandering to an absurd and vulgar demand for banal luxury--the seaside hotel luxury. One even asks oneself whether there was such a demand? It is inconceivable to think <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> can't spend five days of their life without a suite of apartments, cafes, bands, and such-like refined delights. I suspect that the public is not so very guilty in this matter. These things were pushed on to it in the usual course of trade competition. If to-morrow you were to take all these luxuries away, the public would still travel. I don't despair of mankind. I believe that if, by some catastrophic miracle all ships of every kind were to disappear {{off the face of the}} waters, together with the means of replacing them, there would be found, before the end of the week, men (millionaires, perhaps) cheerfully putting out to sea in bath-tubs for a fresh start. We are all like that. This sort of spirit lives in mankind still uncorrupted by the so-called refinements, the ingenuity of tradesmen, who look always for something new to sell, offers to the public.|$|E
