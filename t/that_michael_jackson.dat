5|$|According to The Wall Street Journal {{and diverse}} news sites, the 750 million units sold by Michael Jackson is an {{inflated}} figure that was initially claimed by Raymone Bain (2006), {{who was the}} singer's publicist at that time, without any factual evidence and probably {{in an effort to}} promote album sales. From 2006 until present time, several sources such as RIAA, Rolling Stone, and Time have claimed <b>that</b> <b>Michael</b> <b>Jackson</b> has sold 750 million units (or even 1 billion), however, Adrian Strain, a representative from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) has said that this figure is unreal.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} <b>that</b> <b>Michael</b> <b>Jackson</b> earned about $750 million in his lifetime. Sales of his recordings through Sony's music unit earned him an estimated $300 million in royalties. He {{may have also}} earned an additional $400 million from concerts, music publishing (including {{his share of the}} Beatles catalog), endorsements, merchandising and music videos. Estimating how much of these earnings Jackson was able to personally pocket is difficult because one has to account for taxes, recording costs and production costs.|$|E

Writing for IGN, Robert Canning said in a 2009 review that [...] "Stark Raving Dad" [...] is a [...] "solid, funny and touching episode" [...] and described Jackson's performance as [...] "heartfelt yet self-parodying". In a 2011 article, Andrew Martin of Prefix Mag named Michael Jackson his second favorite musical guest on The Simpsons out of a list of ten.|$|E

500|$|... "Stark Raving Dad" [...] {{was written}} {{specifically}} for Michael Jackson, {{a fan of}} the show, who had called Groening one night and offered to do a guest spot. The offer was accepted and a script was written by Al Jean and Mike Reiss, based on an idea pitched by James L. Brooks. Creator Matt Groening and co-executive producer Sam Simon also contributed significantly to the writing of the episode. In an early version of the script, Homer decided to take his alcoholic friend Barney Gumble in for rehab, but while there Homer began acting crazily so the doctors assumed he was the one to be committed. It was later changed to Homer being hospitalized for wearing a pink shirt, an idea pitched by Brooks. Michael Jackson pitched several story ideas for the episode, such as Bart telling everyone in town <b>that</b> <b>Michael</b> <b>Jackson</b> was coming to his house. He also requested that there be a scene in which he and Bart wrote a song together and asked that a joke about Prince be changed to one about Elvis Presley.|$|E

[...] Dan Aquilante of the New York Post stated that after the Beyoncé's performances of the songs on 4 at the concerts, the album was to be rated a 10 out of 10. He further wrote, [...] "Where tunes felt lackluster and flabby on the recording, Beyoncé injected a vibrancy in the new songs that boosted the material to be almost the equal to some of her best and biggest radio hits." [...] Yolanda Sangweni of Essence magazine viewed the concert as a chance for Beyoncé to remind people that her [...] "vocal chops" [...] are what got her where she stands today as an artist, and concluded <b>that</b> <b>Michael</b> <b>Jackson</b> and Diana Ross would be very proud of Beyoncé's accomplishments and performances on 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé.|$|E

2500|$|The charges {{included}} four {{counts of}} administering alcohol to a minor, which the jury could find was done either {{with intent to}} molest (a felony charge), or without (a misdemeanor).

[...] However, in an earlier police interview, he said he [...] "didn't drink a lot" [...] at Neverland. The prosecution's [...] "grooming" [...] theory held that Jackson used alcohol to lower Gavin's inhibitions in order to molest him, and the accuser testified that the first time he was molested, he and Jackson had just come [...] "back from drinking in the arcade." [...] He also described a time when he was undergoing urine tests related to his cancer treatment, and he worried alcohol would be detected, but was allegedly pressured by Jackson to drink anyway and not take the test. Star's first time drinking alcohol, he claimed, was on the flight back from Miami. [...] Jackson allegedly handed him a Diet Coke can filled with wine. Star testified {{he did not know what}} the drink was when he tasted it, and that it reminded him of the smell of rubbing alcohol (a comparison Gavin also made). Star said Gavin and Michael were sharing the soda can and acting [...] "really weird." [...] However, Cynthia Bell, a flight attendant who had served Jackson on the Miami flight and other flights, testified that she never saw him share his drink with Gavin. She testified that she had devised the custom of serving Jackson wine in Diet Coke cans during flights, because Michael Jackson didn't like to drink alcohol in front of his children.|$|E
