5|$|His role {{in shaping}} North Korean {{literature}} was to be pivotal. Cho's early works Mt. Paektu (MR: Paektusan, 1947) and Land (MR: Ttang, 1946) would point out the direction that North Korean literature was about <b>to</b> <b>take.</b> <b>These</b> works would soon become models for North Korean literature. Upon his return, he started writing for Chosŏn Sinmun, the Soviet Red Army's Korean-language paper, working as a correspondent and translator. He translated works of such Soviet poets as Mayakovsky, Gribachev, and Jambyl Jabayev.|$|E
5|$|In 1817, John Wood died in {{the midst}} of a {{financial}} scandal, and Bute decided to appoint two of his rivals to the posts of Constable and Cardiff's Town Clerk. This would have reaffirmed Bute's power to change the appointments and broken the Wood's family hold on local power, but it provoked a storm of local political wrangling. The Wood family turned on Bute, arguing that he should abandon his claims to control local Welsh affairs from Scotland. Bute replied by trying to crush the Wood family's bank and stacking the town council with his appointees in early 1818. The Woods successfully took legal action, challenging Bute's authority <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>these</b> actions, and anti-Bute violence flared that summer, resulting in arrests by Special Constables appointed by Bute. The pro-Bute faction in Cardiff rallied and the Woods were defeated at the Parliamentary elections that year, the results reaffirming Bute's authority over the town council.|$|E

5|$|Later in {{the morning}} North Korean barges crossed the Naktong below A Company. The company sent a squad with a light machine gun to the {{southern}} tip of the ridge overlooking Agok <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>these</b> troops under fire. When the squad reached the tip of the ridge they saw that a North Korean force occupied houses at its base. The company hit these houses with artillery. The North Koreans broke from the houses, running for the river. At this the light machine gun {{at the tip of the}} ridge took them under fire, as did another across the Naktong to the south in the US 25th Infantry Division sector. Proximity fuze artillery fire decimated this group. Combined fire from all weapons inflicted an estimated 300 casualties on this North Korean force. In the afternoon, US aircraft dropped food and ammunition to the company; only part of it was recovered. The 1st Battalion ordered A Company to withdraw the company that night.|$|E

25|$|A post action {{report by}} the 2/14th Battalion {{identified}} {{that it was a}} mistake not <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>these</b> weapons forward. By the time of the Battle of Brigade Hill–Mission Ridge (from about 6 September), the 21st Brigade was operating a section of three 3-inch mortars that had been parachuted into Myola. When the Australians commenced the advance from Imita Ridge, most battalions moving forward carried a 3-inch mortar with twenty-four bombs and one Vickers machine gun with 3,000 rounds.|$|E
25|$|Some memory {{issues are}} due to stress, anxiety, or depression. A {{traumatic}} life event, such as {{the death of a}} spouse, can lead to changes in lifestyle and can leave an elderly person feeling unsure of themselves, sad, and lonely. Dealing with such drastic life changes can therefore leave some people confused or forgetful. While in some cases these feelings may fade, it is important <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>these</b> emotional problems seriously. By emotionally supporting a struggling relative and seeking help from a doctor or counselor, the forgetfulness can be improved.|$|E
25|$|In total 39,500 French {{civilians were}} {{under the rule of}} Vice-Admiral Schirlitz, who served as the Naval Commander Atlantic Coast, from 1943 in La Rochelle {{until the end of the}} war. The German {{garrison}} numbered 22,000 men. During the siege the Allies still allowed for electricity, wood and some supplies to be delivered in order to alleviate the ordeal of the civilian population inside the walls of the city. The Free French Forces were opposed to such a passive attitude, and desired <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>these</b> coastal cities by force, mostly out of considerations of national pride. FFI troops, however, remained unable to capture the city.|$|E

25|$|The {{corresponding}} percentile of each scaled score {{varies from}} test to test—for example, in 2003, a scaled score of 800 in both {{sections of the}} SAT Reasoning Test corresponded to a percentile of 99.9, while a scaled score of 800 in the SAT Physics Test corresponded to the 94th percentile. The differences in what scores mean with regard to percentiles are due {{to the content of}} the exam and the caliber of students choosing to take each exam. Subject Tests are subject to intensive study (often {{in the form of an}} AP, which is relatively more difficult), and only those who know they will perform well tend <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>these</b> tests, creating a skewed distribution of scores.|$|E
25|$|Desfarges had {{instructions}} {{to negotiate the}} establishment of troops in Mergui and Bangkok rather than the southern Songkla, and <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>these</b> locations if necessary by force. King Narai agreed to the proposal, and fortresses were established in the two cities, commanded by French governors. Desfarges commanded the fortress at Bangkok, with 200 French officers and men, and a Siamese contingent provided by King Narai. du Bruant was in command of Mergui with 90 French soldiers. In 1688, Jean Rival was named governor of Bangkhli (modern Phang Nga). Another 35 soldiers with 3 or 4 French officers were assigned to ships of the King of Siam, with the mission of fighting piracy.|$|E
25|$|Edward Fredkin and Konrad Zuse {{pioneered the}} idea of a computable universe, the former by writing a line in his book on how the world might be like a {{cellular}} automaton, and later further developed by Fredkin using a toy model called Salt. It has been claimed that NKS tries <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>these</b> ideas as its own but Wolfram's model of the universe if a rewriting network and not a cellular automaton as Wolfram himself has suggested a cellular automaton cannot account for relativistic features such as no absolute time frame. Jürgen Schmidhuber has also charged that his work on Turing machine-computable physics was stolen without attribution, namely his idea on enumerating possible Turing-computable universes.|$|E

25|$|Public elementary, {{middle and}} high school test scores in Hawaii are below {{national}} averages on tests mandated under the No Child Left Behind Act. The Hawaii Board of Education requires all eligible students <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>these</b> tests and report all student test scores. This may have unbalanced the results that reported in August 2005 that of 282 schools across the state, 185 failed to reach federal minimum performance standards in mathematics and reading. The ACT college placement tests show that in 2005, seniors scored slightly above the national average (21.9 compared with 20.9), but in the widely accepted SAT examinations, Hawaii's college-bound seniors tend to score below the national average in all categories except mathematics.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, Andronikos III {{had mixed}} results; Thessaly {{returned}} to Imperial rule in 1333, but Serbia once again began expanding southwards: {{led by the}} Byzantine renegade Syrgiannes Palaiologos, Serbian forces took five key forts from Byzantium in 1334 and forced it to recognize the new borders. Nevertheless, Andronikos {{was able to bring}} back Epirus into the fold in 1341 through the use of diplomacy. The result was that whilst the Empire was reduced to its European territories, it had succeeded in bringing much of Greece under its control. Unfortunately for the newly expanded Byzantium, Stephen Dusan (ruling Serbia from 1331) decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>these</b> lands as well from Byzantium. The death of Andronikos III and the resulting chaos left the Empire in no position to fight back.|$|E
25|$|There are {{multiple}} misconceptions {{in regards to}} poverty. Research has undermined the idea that parents of low socioeconomic status do not value education, when in truth they hold the same attitudes as wealthy families. It {{is not an issue}} of value, but more so a problem of access. A parent from a lower socioeconomic class is likely to have more factors than a parent from a wealthy socioeconomic class that may affect their involvement with their child’s education. For instance a person living in poverty is more likely to work multiple jobs, as well as not having certain means of transportation, thus hindering their access to their child’s education. The teachers, faculty, and administrators of the schools have <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>these</b> real-life factors into consideration.|$|E

25|$|The {{revolt of}} Ghent began as {{resistance}} of the civic representatives to the growing power of the Valois Dukes of Burgundy over their city, with popular support, particularly over attempts by the Duke, Philip the Good to impose indirect taxes, including a salt tax on the city, similar to the French Gabelle, from 1447. The civic authorities were overthrown by a popular movement that ruled through a general assembly. Most the major neighbouring towns, afraid of popular revolt in their own locations, sided with the Duke and he declared war on Ghent on 31 May 1452. The Duke attempted to blockade the city by garrisoning surrounding towns, including Oudenaarde, which lies further up on the River Scheldt, which he put {{under the command of}} one of his leading captains Simon de Lalaing. Ghent attempted <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>these</b> surrounding towns to break the blockade and to form a line of defence against the forces of the Duke and his allies.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of the next few days the Japanese {{continued}} resistance around Mutanchiang from a series of fortified hills, from which they could rain fire on the Soviet corridors. The Red Army was forced <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>these</b> hills one by one, using its preponderance in armor and artillery to neutralize the defenses. During the struggle for Mount Shozu, an important Japanese stronghold, the weight of Soviet fire was so great that it appeared as if the top of the mountain had been blown completely off. Suicide bombers and anti-tank guns remained an ever-present threat: on August 14 Japanese forces near Ssutaoling knocked out 16 Soviet tanks with direct fire and a further 5 with suicide bombers; the latter vehicles being destroyed by only 5 men. Nevertheless, these attacks were reliant on the fanaticism of the individual Japanese soldier, and while they resulted in the destruction of Soviet armor, Japanese human losses were much higher.|$|E
25|$|The {{species is}} known to undergo a dietary shift as it grows to adulthood. Young {{individuals}} less than 10cm in length consume considerable volumes of copepods and minor amounts of polychaetes, but once they reach around 10cm, the diet shifts to a polychaete-dominated one. Further growth sees {{an increase in the}} volume of amphipods, small fish and oligochaetes taken. These changes appear to be unrelated to mouth morphology, instead the fish becomes more mobile and possesses a larger mouth to be able <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>these</b> prey. The yellowfin whitings' diet also varies spatially and temporally, which appears to be a function of prey availability at different sites and periods of the year. There is little resource partitioning between the small individuals of sillaginids which inhabit shallow inshore habitats, with Sillago vittata, S. burrus and Sillaginodes punctatus also taking copepods as their primary prey in southwest Western Australia. This changes as each species grows, with S. vittata and S burrus moving to deeper waters to avoid interspecific competition, whilst the remaining S. schomburgkii and Sillaginodes punctatus partition the resources, with S. punctatus consuming more decapods and shrimps.|$|E
