50|$|A bank <b>transfer</b> (also {{known as}} a wire <b>transfer</b> or credit <b>transfer)</b> is a method of <b>transferring</b> money from one person or {{institution}} (entity) to another. A wire <b>transfer</b> {{can be made from}} one bank account to another bank account or through a <b>transfer</b> of cash at a cash office. A bank wire <b>transfer</b> is often the most expedient method for <b>transferring</b> funds between bank accounts. The <b>transfer</b> messages are sent via a secure system (such as SWIFT or Fedwire) utilizing IBAN and BIC codes. Online bank <b>transfer</b> systems in Europe are popular alternative payment methods, where the bank <b>transfer</b> is authorized by the consumer who logs onto his bank website and authorizes the funds <b>transfer</b> for payment to a merchant.|$|R
40|$|This paper compares how {{cash and}} in-kind <b>transfers</b> affect local prices.

Hence, in-kind <b>transfers</b> should lead to lower prices than cash <b>transfers,</b> which helps consumers {{at the expense of}} local producers. We test and confirm this prediction using a program in Mexico that randomly assigned villages to receive boxes of food (trucked into the village), equivalently-valued cash <b>transfers,</b> or no <b>transfers.</b> The pecuniary benefit to consumers of in-kind <b>transfers,</b> relative to cash <b>transfers,</b> equals 11 % of the direct <b>transfer.</b> ...|$|R
