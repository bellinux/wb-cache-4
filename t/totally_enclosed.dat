5|$|Some herons, such as {{the black}} heron, adopt an unusual {{position}} while hunting for prey. With their head held down in a hunting position, they sweep their wings forward to meet {{in front of their}} head, thereby forming an umbrella shaped canopy. The primaries and secondaries touch the water, the nape feathers are erected and the tail is drooped, thereby ensuring the canopy is <b>totally</b> <b>enclosed.</b> The bird may take several strides in this position. One theory about the function of this behaviour is that it reduces glare from the water surface, allowing the bird to more easily locate and catch prey. Alternatively, the shade provided by the canopy may attract fish making their capture easier. Some herons adopt a similar behaviour called double-wing feeding in which the wings are swept forward to create an area of shade, though a canopy is not formed.|$|E

40|$|We {{have studied}} the human thymus {{microenvironment}} {{in order to identify}} subsets of cells that may be responsible for the induction of different aspects of T-lymphocyte differentiation, education and MHC restriction. Using immunofluorescence on tissue sections and cell suspensions we have found MHC products (HLA-A, B, C and DR) to be present throughout the thymus epithelium whilst human T-cell antigens are absent from all non-lymphoid cells. In contrast, Thy- 1 antigen (expressed on approximately 1 % paediatric human thymocytes) has a differential expression amongst thymic epithelial cells, being confined to those in the subcapsular cortex and to 'thymic nurse cells' (TNC). The former represent the site to which thymocyte precursors first migrate upon entering the thymus.

40|$|AbstractJoint {{morphogenesis}} is {{an important}} phase of prenatal joint development during which the opposing cartilaginous rudiments acquire their reciprocal and interlocking shapes. At {{an early stage of}} development, the prenatal hip joint is formed of a deep acetabular cavity that almost <b>totally</b> <b>encloses</b> the head. By the time of birth, the acetabulum has become shallower and the femoral head has lost substantial sphericity, reducing joint coverage and stability. In this study, we use a dynamic mechanobiological simulation to explore the effects of normal (symmetric), reduced and abnormal (asymmetric) prenatal movements on hip joint shape, to understand their importance for postnatal skeletal malformations such as developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). We successfully predict the physiological trends of decreasing sphericity and acetabular coverage of the femoral head during fetal development. We show that a full range of symmetric movements helps to maintain some of the acetabular depth and femoral head sphericity, while reduced or absent movements can lead to decreased sphericity and acetabular coverage of the femoral head. When an abnormal movement pattern was applied, a deformed joint shape was predicted, with an opened asymmetric acetabulum and the onset of a malformed femoral head. This study provides evidence for the importance of fetal movements in the prevention and manifestation of congenital musculoskeletal disorders such as DDH...|$|R
40|$|Sandwich {{structures}} {{have been}} widely used for many years in applications such as aircraft panels, marine-craft hulls, racing car bodies and spacecraft solar arrays. Most sandwich panel designs include a lightweight core such as paper honeycomb or closed cell foam encased between two face plates, {{and in the case of}} aircraft panels constructed from carbon fibre reinforced plastics, the core is bevelled and edge pan plies are included to <b>totally</b> <b>enclose</b> the core. This type of design restricts access to the core making it almost impossible for the engineer to measure the shear strain developed in the core during in-service static or dynamic loading. This paper introduces a new measurement technique whereby the shear strain in the core can be estimated from face plate measurements using a linear finite difference approximation. The estimation method is presented and supported by calculations on a statically loaded sandwich beam. Static and dynamic experiments were conducted in order to validate the technique using a honeycomb sandwich beam instrumented with strain gauges on the core and face plates. The results showed excellent agreement between measured and estimated core shear strain for sandwich configurations with thin face plates, such as those encountered in aircraft and marine-craft constructions...|$|R
40|$|Similarity {{retrieval}} mechanisms should utilize generalized {{quadratic form}} distance functions {{as well as}} the Euclidean distance function since ellipsoid queries parameters may vary with the user and situation. In this paper, we present a spatial transformation technique that yields a new search method for adaptive ellipsoid queries. The technique is based on the notion of spatial transformation and e#ciently supports adaptive ellipsoid queries with quadratic form distance functions. Although conventional search methods can support ellipsoid queries by using multi-dimensional index structures, these methods incur high CPUcost for measuring distances between a query point and bounding rectangles with respect to quadratic form distance functions, which exceeds disk access cost on search processing. The basic idea is to transform the bounding rectangles in the original space, wherein distance from a query point is measured by quadratic form distance functions, into spatial objects in a new space wherein distance is measured by Euclidean distance functions. Since bounding rectangles in the original space are transformed into multi-dimensional polygons in the new space, and thus incurring high CPU-cost for distance calculations, our proposed method approximates a polygon by the rectangle that <b>totally</b> <b>encloses</b> the polygon, and measures the distance from the query point to the rectangle instead to the polygon in the Euclidean space. It follows that the spatial transformation technique guarantees no false drops. In contrast to the conventional methods, our proposed method significantly reduces CPU-cost due to the distance approximation by the spatial transformation; exact distance evaluations are avoided for most of the accessed bounding rectangles in the index structures.

40|$|The {{capturing}} of {{red deer}} {{from the wild}} to stock deer farms has brought with it problems of stress. Large numbers of deer have died due to poor catching techniques and inappropriate drugs. Efforts to minimize these deaths require {{an understanding of the}} physiology, pathology and epidemiology of the changes occurring within the animal and during capture. To assist in the correct interpretation of the data collected, normal haematological and biochemical parameters had to be established. This was carried out on deer of different age groups and sex from deer farms. In addition the effects of the commonly used capture drugs on the biochemical parameters were established. Blood and serum were obtained from captured animals at the site of capture and where possible further samples were obtained from these animals at set intervals. The biochemical parameters found to vary from the normal in captured animals were pH, Pco 2, lactate, SGOT, (Aspartate aminotransferase), blood urea nitrogen, and potassium. The changes in these parameters clearly indicated a profound acute or delayed lactic acidosis and severe muscle damage both skeletal and cardiac. The captured animals were divided into those which survived (captured) and those which died (myopathic). It was found that the changes in the 'myopathic' group were more profound than in the 'captured' group. The rising blood urea nitrogen levels and damaged cardiac muscle may account for the delayed deaths from uraemia due to a severe nephrosis and cardiac failure. The clinical effects on captured animals were recorded and those that died in both the acute and delayed form were necropsied. The gross and histological lesions were described. The most obvious clinical changes in addition to temperature, respiration and heart rates were lameness, recumbency and the wry neck. Histologically, the muscle changes resembled those found in white muscle disease of domestic ruminants in this country. The epidemiological studies suggested certain simple measures could be taken to reduce the effects of the respiratory depression resulting from the drugs and transportation, to reduce the stress of capture and to allow acclimatisation to the new conditions. These were (1) that less or no Nalorphine be used, (2) that the animals were caught early in the year, (3) that young smaller females were preferred to males (4) that a loose bag <b>totally</b> <b>enclosing</b> the animals was used, (5) that darkened conditions helped keep the animals quiet and (6) all captured animals should be retained in a dark house for two or more days before release into the paddocks...|$|R

2500|$|Cabinet {{table saws}} are heavy (using {{large amounts of}} cast iron and steel) to {{minimize}} vibration and increase accuracy. A cabinet saw is characterized by having an enclosed base (cabinet). Cabinet saws usually have induction motors in the 3 to 5 hp (2 to 4kW) range, single-phase, but motors in the 5 to 7 HP (4 to 6kW) range, three-phase, are common in commercial/industrial sites. For home use, this type of motor typically requires that a heavy-duty circuit be installed (in the US, this requires a 240 volt receptacle, or [...] "hard" [...] wiring and a dedicated branch circuit). The motor is enclosed within the cabinet and drives the blade with two to four parallel V-belts, often [...] "A" [...] belts as [...] "A" [...] belts may be ganged without having to be specially selected (otherwise, specially selected sets of light-duty [...] "4L" [...] belts are used).

2500|$|The Carbon Dragon is {{predominantly}} a conventional wood and doped aircraft fabric glider, making judicious use of carbon fiber in the wing spar caps, control rods, flaperons and the elliptical tail boom to save weight. The control tubes are constructed by laying up the carbon fiber on aluminium tubing and then, when the carbon has cured, dissolving the aluminium with swimming pool acid. The cockpit is <b>totally</b> <b>enclosed</b> {{and the original}} design called for a cockpit width of [...] at the hips and [...] at the shoulder, although some have been modified to accommodate pilots of larger dimensions. The main aircraft structure consists of dual triangular torque boxes {{on each side of}} the fuselage. The wing employs a Culver SD airfoil that was designed by Irv Culver for the project and full-span flaperons of 30% chord. The flaperons can deploy from −5° to +15° as flaps and −4° to +16° as ailerons, with a 4:1 differential. The flaperons are driven by two, vertically mounted pushrods enclosed within the fuselage and connected to the side stick. The wing ribs forward of the spar are fabricated from [...] 5-ply mahogany and aft of the spar from [...] square spruce. The landing gear is a fixed monowheel, mounted on the hinged cockpit bottom door, that opens to allow the pilot to lift the aircraft for foot-launching. The aircraft was designed so that if the pilot falls while foot-launching his body will be in the rear fuselage cavity and not pinned under the aircraft. The ultimate structural load limit is +/-7.5 g, with a +/-5.0 g operational load limit.|$|E
50|$|A great {{step forward}} in {{countering}} the problem of firedamp came when 'safety lamps' intended to provide illumination whilst being incapable of igniting firedamp were brought forward by both George Stephenson and Sir Humphry Davy, in response to accidents such as the Felling mine disaster near Newcastle upon Tyne claiming 92 lives on 25 May 1812. Davy experimented with brass gauze, determining the maximum size of the gaps and the optimum wire thickness to prevent a flame passing through the gauze. If a naked flame was thus <b>enclosed</b> <b>totally</b> by such a gauze, then methane could pass into the lamp and burn safely above the flame. Stephenson's lamp (the 'Geordie lamp') worked on a different principle: the flame was enclosed by glass; air access to the flame was through tubes sufficiently narrow that the flame could not burn-back in incoming firedamp, and the exiting gases were too weak in oxygen to allow the enclosed flame to reach the surrounding atmosphere. Both principles were combined in later versions of safety lamps.|$|R
40|$|Exposure to Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) {{in hotels}} and clubs is of {{community}} concern and {{may lead to}} a variety of adverse health outcomes for workers and patrons. This study sought to measure ETS in both smoking and non-smoking areas of hospitality venues in South Australia and to assess the effectiveness of ETS control measures. Seven hotels, clubs and cafes were investigated and the concentrations of airborne nicotine and particulate matter (PM 10) were measured as markers of ETS exposure during normal to busy periods. Overall average concentrations were higher in smoking areas (nicotine= 15 mg/m 3 and PM 10 = 255 mg/m 3) compared with non-smoking dining areas (nicotine= 7 mg/ m 3 and PM 10 = 192 mg/m 3). The data demonstrate an approximate two-fold reduction of ETS within nonsmoking areas and suggest that mechanical ventilation is only partially effective in preventing propagation of ETS throughout premises. Risk models suggest that ETS exposures in non-smoking areas may still represent an appreciable health risk.
