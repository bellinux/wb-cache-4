While walking around the property, Tim finds a gun and a bone in the backyard. At first he wants to dig up the {{surrounding}} ground <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> body is buried there, but Lee convinces him it is a bad idea.|$|E
25|$|A web bug is {{an object}} {{embedded}} into a web page or email {{and is usually}} invisible to the user of the website or reader of the email. It allows checking <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> person has looked at a particular website or read a specific email message.|$|E
25|$|Another {{situation}} where quick guessing is possible {{is when the}} password is used to form a cryptographic key. In such cases, an attacker can quickly check <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> guessed password successfully decodes encrypted data. For example, one commercial product claims to test 103,000 WPA PSK passwords per second.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, Downside was {{the setting}} for a {{television}} show A Second Chance, in which a teenager from London, Ryan Bell, was sent to Downside <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> 'difficult' student would do better in the independent sector. After excelling at Latin, biology, and on the rugby field, Bell was eventually expelled after being caught drinking.|$|E
25|$|Between 1992 and 1996, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing experimented <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> {{web press}} that used {{continuous}} rolls of paper was quicker and cheaper than intaglio printing, which used flat sheets. The affected notes are dollar bills from Series 1988A, Series 1993 and Series 1995. They are legal tender {{and are not}} considered error notes, although they are valuable due to their rarity.|$|E
25|$|The duckwalk is {{one out of}} 25 {{exercises}} in the physical test at United States Military Entrance Processing Command (MEPS). The duckwalk tests <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> trainee is flat footed or if it hurts to perform the exercise. It also makes sure that the trainee has proper ranges of motion. Trainees who fail the duckwalk are temporarily suspended from MEPS and have to try again at a later date.|$|E

50|$|A {{web beacon}} is {{any of a}} number of {{techniques}} used to track who is reading a web page or email, when, and from which computer. They can also be used <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> email was read or forwarded to someone else, or <b>if</b> <b>a</b> web page was copied to another website. The first web beacons were small images.|$|R
50|$|During {{application}} loading, the Windows loader {{searches for}} the manifest. If it is present, the loader adds information from it to the activation context When the COM class factory tries to instantiate a class, the activation context is first checked <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> implementation for the CLSID can be found. Only if the lookup fails is the registry scanned.|$|R
25|$|In 1938, he was {{assigned}} as the Senior Aviator for Cruiser Scouting Squadron Eight aboard the light cruiser Savannah, flying Curtiss SOC-1 Seagull floatplanes. His most memorable aviation experience occurred during this tour when he performed night test flights <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> floatplane could be operated in blackout conditions at sea. The conclusion was that it could, but probably not with the same pilot {{for more than one}} flight.|$|E
25|$|Politicians in the Newburgh {{area had}} also been {{lobbying}} for a bridge over Newburgh Bay, as the ferry service in that section of the river was becoming financially unviable. In 1951 {{they were able to}} authorize test borings in the riverbed <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> bridge was feasible. It was, but their counterparts further up the river got legislation passed that prohibited any construction of the Newburgh Bay bridge until the KingstonRhinecliff Bridge was completed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} week of the first phase, {{recruits}} are taught swimming and water survival. This is the first event where failure to pass will result in a recruit being dropped to a different company to restart training and attempt to qualify again. If a recruit fails twice, he or she will be evaluated <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> third chance is warranted, or if the recruit will be deemed unable to qualify and administratively separated from service.|$|E

25|$|The main {{interest}} of the questionnaire was <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> participant answered yes to the first question, implying that they believed in the hot-hand fallacy. The results showed that participants over 70 years of age were {{twice as likely to}} believe the fallacy than adults 40–49, confirming that the older individuals relied more on heuristic-based processes. Older adults are more likely to remember positive information, making them more sensitive to gains and less to losses than younger adults.|$|E
25|$|Syntax {{highlighting}} {{also helps}} programmers find errors in their program. For example, most editors highlight string literals {{in a different}} color. Consequently, spotting a missing delimiter is much easier because of the contrasting color of the text. Brace matching is another important feature with many popular editors. This makes it simple <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> brace has been left out or locate the match of the brace the cursor is on by highlighting the pair in a different color.|$|E
25|$|Other {{buildings}} {{remained for}} a while after the 1964 Fair's conclusion <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> new use for them could be found, but were subsequently demolished. This included the Travel and Transportation Pavilion, destroyed in 1967 after a failed conversion to a firehouse, and the Federal Pavilion, demolished in 1977 after great deterioration. One such parcel became {{the site of the}} Playground for All Children, one of the first playgrounds designed to include handicapped-accessible activities. The design competition for the playground was won by architect Hisham N. Ashkouri; the facility was completed in 1984, and it was refurbished and reopened in 1997.|$|E

25|$|To be able {{to perform}} a proper {{diagnosis}} of this pathogen is it important to take samples from the suspected infected individuals such as a stool, throat, or nasopharyngeal sample. There are various tests that can be done on these samples <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> person is infected. Viral antigen can be detected by performing an assay. A serological assay can also be performed on the sample to look for virus-specific antibodies present in the sample, thus showing that the person is trying to combat the virus. The virus can be isolated in culture through the use of mouse-L fibroblasts, green monkey kidney cells, as well as HeLa cells.|$|E
25|$|Following the Lake Nyos tragedy, {{scientists}} investigated other African lakes <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> similar phenomenon {{could happen}} elsewhere. Lake Kivu in Democratic Republic of Congo, 2,000 {{times larger than}} Lake Nyos, was also found to be supersaturated, and geologists found evidence for outgassing events around the lake about every thousand years. The eruption of nearby Mount Nyiragongo in 2002 sent lava flowing into the lake, raising fears that a gas eruption could be triggered, but it was not, as the flow of lava stopped well before it got near the bottom layers of the lake, where the gas is maintained in solution by the water pressure.|$|E
25|$|Another {{study was}} started <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> new RISC {{architecture}} could be defined that could directly support the VMS operating system. The new design used {{most of the}} basic PRISM concepts, but was re-tuned to allow VMS and VMS programs to run at reasonable speed with no conversion at all. The decision was also made to upgrade the design to a full 64-bit implementation from PRISM's 32-bit, a conversion {{all of the major}} RISC vendors were undertaking. Eventually that new architecture became Alpha. The primary Alpha instruction set architects were Richard L. Sites and Richard T. Witek. The PRISM's Epicode was developed into the Alpha's PALcode, providing an abstracted interface to platform- and processor implementation-specific features.|$|E

25|$|On August 1, 1828, {{a man by}} {{the name}} of Barney Griffin, who had {{travelled}} from Syracuse to the Village of Sackets Harbor several days earlier, ended up dying in the Jefferson County Poor House. Orville went over to investigate. Upon searching Griffin's clothes, he found the cash sum of two hundred and twenty-two dollars and fifteen cents - more than enough money for Griffin to pay for a hotel. Hungerford put an advertisement in the a paper <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> relative would claim the money. No one did. He then turned the money over to the County Treasurer for use of the Poor House, deducting a dollar for the advertisement money that came out of his own pocket. Understanding the nature of greed, he asked the County Board of Supervisors to indemnify him for his actions, which it agreed to do.|$|E
25|$|Paramount studio head Robert Evans brought Polanski to America {{ostensibly to}} direct the film Downhill Racer, but told Polanski that {{he really wanted to}} him to read the horror novel Rosemary's Baby by Ira Levin <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> film could be made out of it. Polanski read it {{non-stop}} through the night and the following morning decided he wanted to write as well as direct it. He wrote the 272-page screenplay for the film in slightly longer than three weeks. The film, Rosemary's Baby (1968), was a box-office success and became his first Hollywood production, thereby establishing his reputation as a major commercial filmmaker. The film, a horror-thriller set in trendy Manhattan, is about Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow), a young housewife who is impregnated by the devil. Polanski's screenplay adaptation earned him a second Academy Award nomination.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} get the feel of an actual documentary, the {{producers}} hired cinematographer Randall Einhorn, who is known for directing episodes of Survivor, which allowed the show to have the feel of [...] "rough and jumpy" [...] like an actual documentary. According to producer Michael Schur, the producers to the series would follow the documentary format strictly. The producers would have long discussions over whether a scene could work under the documentary format. For example, in the fourth-season episode [...] "Did I Stutter?," [...] a scene featured Michael going through a long process {{to go to the bathroom}} and not pass by Stanley. The producers debated whether that was possible and Einhorn walked through the whole scene in order <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> camera man could get to all the places in time to shoot the whole scene. Despite the strict nature in the early years of the series, later seasons seem to have loosened the rules on the format, with the camera crew often going into places that actual documentary crews would not, which also changed the writing and comedy-style of the series. This inconsistency has received criticism from critics and fans.|$|E
50|$|To assist diagnosis, {{a doctor}} can order an HbA1c test, which {{measures}} the blood sugar average {{over the two}} or three months before the test. The more specific 6-hour glucose tolerance test can be used to chart changes in the patient's blood sugar levels before ingestion of a special glucose drink and at regular intervals during the six hours following <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> unusual rise or drop in blood glucose levels occurs.|$|R
