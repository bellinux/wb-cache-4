50|$|The Eight-Foot High Speed Tunnel, {{also known}} as Eight-Foot <b>Transonic</b> <b>Tunnel,</b> was a wind tunnel located in Building 641 of NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. It was a National Historic Landmark.|$|E
50|$|Some {{new test}} {{facilities}} came on line to help turn numerous aerospace system ideas into reality. The J-4 Large Rocket Engine Test Facility was dedicated in 1964.

50|$|The {{historic}} Farnborough factory site houses {{three major}} wind tunnels, the 24' low speed wind tunnel (Q121 Building), constructed {{during the early}} 1930s, the No. 2 11.5' low speed wind tunnel (R136 Building) and the 8' x 6' transonic wind tunnel within R133 Building, which was originally commissioned in the early 1940s as a 10' x 7' high subsonic speed tunnel, but converted during the mid-1950s. A smaller 2' x 1.5' <b>transonic</b> <b>tunnel</b> is housed in R133 Building, while R52 Building contains the remaining 4' x 3' low turbulence wind tunnel. R52 Building had previously housed two early 10' x 7' low speed tunnels in separate bays, which were replaced by the No. 1 11.5' and 4' x 3' tunnels respectively. The former remains in operation at the University of Southampton. R52 building also previously contained a 5' open jet low speed tunnel, originally built as a sub-scale prototype for the larger 24' tunnel, but subsequently modified {{for use as a}} noise measurement facility. Both Q121 and R133 are now Grade I listed buildings.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} using liquid {{nitrogen}} {{to cool the}} test gas of a wind tunnel to cryogenic temperatures lead to the achievement of very high Reynolds number flows in relatively small <b>transonic</b> <b>tunnels.</b> The economical operation of liquid nitrogen cooled cryogenic tunnels is critically dependent on fast and accurate control of the tunnel variables. The control problem of a continuous flow fan driven cryogenic tunnel was addressed, first by developing a lumped multivariable mathematical model of a tunnel and validating the model by reconciling {{the responses of the}} Langley 0. 3 m <b>transonic</b> cryogenic <b>tunnel</b> to the responses of the mathematical model on a simulator. Finally, the development of laws for the closed loop control of the tunnel pressure and temperature and the successful implementation of a control system for the 0. 3 m <b>transonic</b> cryogenic <b>tunnel</b> based on these laws are presented...|$|R
