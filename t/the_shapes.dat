5|$|Nuskhuri letters vary in height, with ascenders and descenders, and are slanted to the right. Letters have an angular shape, with a {{noticeable}} tendency to simplify <b>the</b> <b>shapes</b> {{they had in}} Asomtavruli. This enabled faster writing of manuscripts.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>shape</b> {{feedback}} control model {{is used for}} closed-loop control. This model establishes the increment relationship between <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> control means and <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> parameters. A one-to-one mapping relation between <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> control means and the standard patterns is adopted by <b>the</b> traditional <b>shape</b> {{feedback control}} model. The interaction of various shape control means is not considered, showing that the theory is imperfect and its calculation precision is poor. Researches on <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> feedback control model aim to improve calculation accuracy and speed. According to the criterion whether <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> pattern recognition is used, <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> feedback control model can display in two forms, namely, multi-point control method and standard pattern control method.|$|R
50|$|Another {{approach}} is to consider a function defined on a rectangular box around <b>the</b> <b>shape,</b> which is positive inside of <b>the</b> <b>shape,</b> zero on <b>the</b> boundary of <b>the</b> <b>shape,</b> and negative outside of <b>the</b> <b>shape.</b> One can then evolve this function instead of <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> itself. One can consider a rectangular grid on the box and sample the function at the grid points. As <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> evolves, <b>the</b> grid points do not change; only thefunction values at the grid points change. This approach, of using a fixedgrid, is called the Eulerian approach. The idea of using a functionto represent <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> is at <b>the</b> basis of the level set method.|$|R

5|$|Thompson {{notes that}} surface tension in living cells {{is reduced by}} {{substances}} resembling oils and soaps; where the concentrations of these vary locally, <b>the</b> <b>shapes</b> of cells are affected.

5|$|By 1960 Moore {{was moving}} on from his earlier works, {{directly}} {{inspired by the}} human form and with textured surfaces, such as Draped Seated Woman 1957–58, to more rounded abstract shapes, inspired by <b>the</b> <b>shapes</b> of stones or bones. Moore made a connected work in 1961, also inspired by bone, Standing Figure (Knife Edge) (LH 482).|$|E
5|$|DNA {{nanotechnology}} {{uses the}} unique molecular recognition properties of DNA and other nucleic acids to create self-assembling branched DNA complexes with useful properties. DNA is thus {{used as a}} structural material {{rather than as a}} carrier of biological information. This has {{led to the creation of}} two-dimensional periodic lattices (both tile-based and using the DNA origami method) and three-dimensional structures in <b>the</b> <b>shapes</b> of polyhedra. Nanomechanical devices and algorithmic self-assembly have also been demonstrated, and these DNA structures have been used to template the arrangement of other molecules such as gold nanoparticles and streptavidin proteins.|$|E
5000|$|A third {{approach}} is to think of <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> evolution as of a flow problem. That is, one can imagine that <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> is made of a plastic material gradually deforming such that any point inside or on the boundary of <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> can be always traced back {{to a point of}} <b>the</b> original <b>shape</b> in a one-to-one fashion. Mathematically, if [...] is <b>the</b> initial <b>shape,</b> and [...] is <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> at time t,one considers the diffeomorphisms ...|$|R
30|$|Shape {{descriptors}} are {{numbers that}} are computed from a two-dimensional shape. In some cases, the set of numbers is complete {{in the sense that}} <b>the</b> original <b>shape</b> can be reconstructed from <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> descriptors[1, 2], but even in these situations, only a subset of <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> descriptors is typically used in practical applications. <b>The</b> <b>shape</b> descriptors can thus be considered as an approximative description of <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> such that shape similarity somehow corresponds to similarity of <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> descriptors. Consequently, they can be used for object recognition and object similarity detection.|$|R
50|$|One {{approach}} is to follow the boundary of <b>the</b> <b>shape.</b> For that, one can sample <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> boundary in a relatively dense and uniform manner, that is, to consider enough points to get a sufficiently accurate outline of <b>the</b> <b>shape.</b> Then, one can evolve <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> by gradually moving the boundary points. This is called the Lagrangian approach.|$|R
5|$|From {{the figure}} of the artist, the viewer's eye leaps again diagonally into the {{pictorial}} space. Another man stands, echoing and opposing the form of the artist, outside rather than inside, made clearly defined and yet barely identifiable by the light and shade. The positioning of such an area of strong tonal contrast right {{at the rear of the}} pictorial space is a daring compositional tactic. <b>The</b> <b>shapes</b> of bright light are similar to the irregular light shapes of the foreground Maid of Honour, but the sharply defined door-frame repeats the border of the mirror.|$|E
5|$|Fu: Fu were Chinese tally sticks made of bamboo, wood, metal (gold, silver, bronze) or jade {{and used}} as a proof of authorization. Most commonly, fu were made of wood or bamboo in sizes of wooden slips or bamboo chopsticks. Although fu {{have been made in}} various shapes (such as tiger, dragon, turtle, snake, fish or human), most of them come {{in the shape of a}} tiger. Classical {{description}} of tallies is found in the Zhou li, which refers to the tallies of jade and horn, and mentions <b>the</b> <b>shapes</b> of tiger, human, dragon, seal, and banner.|$|E
5|$|He {{considers}} the forces such as surface tension acting on cells, and Plateau's experiments on soap films. He illustrates {{the way a}} splash breaks into droplets and compares this to <b>the</b> <b>shapes</b> of Campanularian zoophytes (Hydrozoa). He looks at the flask-like shapes of single-celled organisms such as species of Vorticella, considering teleological and physical explanations of their having minimal areas; and at the hanging drop shapes of some Foraminifera such as Lagena. He argues that the cells of trypanosomes are similarly shaped by surface tension.|$|E

5|$|In biology, natural {{selection}} {{can cause the}} development of patterns in living things for several reasons, including camouflage, sexual selection, and different kinds of signalling, including mimicry and cleaning symbiosis. In plants, <b>the</b> <b>shapes,</b> colours, and patterns of insect-pollinated flowers like the lily have evolved to attract insects such as bees. Radial patterns of colours and stripes, some visible only in ultraviolet light serve as nectar guides {{that can be seen}} at a distance.|$|E
5|$|Scientists have {{proposed}} that carbonate globules found in meteorite ALH84001, which {{is thought to have}} originated from Mars, could be fossilized microbes extant on Mars when the meteorite was blasted from the Martian surface by a meteor strike some 15 million years ago.

5|$|Thayer's {{original}} argument, restated by Cott, {{was that}} nature did {{the exact opposite}} with countershading that an artist did with paint when creating the illusion of solid three-dimensionality, namely counteracting the effect of shade to flatten out form. Shading is a powerful cue used by animals in different phyla to identify <b>the</b> <b>shapes</b> of objects. Research with chicks showed that they preferred to peck at grains with shadows falling below them (as if illuminated from above), so both humans and birds may make use of shading as a depth cue.|$|E

5|$|The Reuleaux {{triangle}} is {{the first}} of a sequence of Reuleaux polygons, whose boundaries are curves of constant width formed from regular polygons with an odd number of sides. Some of these curves have been used as <b>the</b> <b>shapes</b> of coins. The Reuleaux triangle can also be generalized into three dimensions in multiple ways: the Reuleaux tetrahedron (the intersection of four balls whose centers lie on a regular tetrahedron) does not have constant width, but can be modified by rounding its edges to form the Meissner tetrahedron, which does. Alternatively, the surface of revolution of the Reuleaux triangle also has constant width.|$|E
5|$|The {{base coat}} of the jaguar is {{generally}} a tawny yellow, but can range to reddish-brown and black, {{for most of}} the body. However, the ventral areas are white. The cat is covered in rosettes for camouflage in the dappled light of its forest habitat. The spots vary over individual coats and between individual jaguars: rosettes may include one or several dots, and <b>the</b> <b>shapes</b> of the dots vary. The spots on the head and neck are generally solid, as are those on the tail, where they may merge to form a band.|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for calculating shape sensitivities, within MSC/NASTRAN, {{in a simple}} manner without resort to external programs. The method uses natural design variables to define <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> changes in a given structure. Once <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> sensitivities are obtained, <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> optimization process is carried out {{in a manner similar}} to property optimization processes. The capability of this method is illustrated by two examples: <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> optimization of a cantilever beam with holes, loaded by a point load at the free end (with <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> of <b>the</b> holes and the thickness of the beam selected as the design variables), and <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> optimization of a connecting rod subjected to several different loading and boundary conditions...|$|R

5|$|The use of polyhedra {{to model}} heavenly bodies {{can be traced}} back to Plato, who in the Timaeus {{identified}} the regular dodecahedron with the shape of the heavens and its twelve faces with the constellations of the zodiac. Later, Johannes Kepler theorized that the distribution of distances of the planets from the sun could be explained by <b>the</b> <b>shapes</b> of the five Platonic solids, nested within each other. Escher kept a model of this system of nested polyhedra, and regularly depicted polyhedra in his artworks relating to astronomy and other worlds.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{considers}} the laws governing <b>the</b> <b>shapes</b> of cells, {{at least in}} simple cases such as the fine hairs (a cell thick) in the rhizoids of mosses. He analyses the geometry of cells in a frog's egg when it has divided into 4, 8 and even 64 cells. He shows that uniform growth can lead to unequal cell sizes, and argues that the way cells divide {{is driven by the}} shape of the dividing structure (and not vice versa).|$|E
5|$|Christiansen and Tschopp (2010) {{state that}} {{presence}} of a horny sheath in Hesperosaurus is a strong indication that the plates had primarily a defensive function, as a horn layer would have strengthened the plate {{as a whole and}} provided it with sharp cutting edges. Also the display function would have been reinforced, because the sheath would have increased the visible surface and such horn structures are often brightly colored. Thermoregulation, on the other hand would have been hampered by an extra insulating layer and the smoothness of the surface, but cannot be entirely ruled out as extant cattle and ducks use horns and beaks to dump excess heat despite the keratin covering. A 2015 study of <b>the</b> <b>shapes</b> and sizes of Hespersaurus plates suggested that they were sexually dimorphic, with wide plates belonging to males and taller plates belonging to females.|$|E
