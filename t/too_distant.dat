5|$|Although Sedna {{is officially}} {{considered}} a scattered-disc object by the MPC, its discoverer Michael E. Brown {{has suggested that}} because its perihelion distance of 76 AU is <b>too</b> <b>distant</b> {{to be affected by}} the gravitational attraction of the outer planets it should be considered an inner-Oort-cloud object rather than a member of the scattered disc. This classification of Sedna as a detached object is accepted in recent publications.|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{observed}} the Milky Way, previously {{believed to be}} nebulous, and {{found it to be}} a multitude of stars packed so densely that they appeared from Earth to be clouds. He located many other stars <b>too</b> <b>distant</b> to be visible with the naked eye. He {{observed the}} double star Mizar in Ursa Major in 1617.|$|E
5|$|At 15:05 another British ship {{appeared}} on the horizon, the sloop , which persuaded Montfort that {{he could no longer}} protect the battered Pomone against superior numbers. Pauline set all sail to the west, away from her opponents who were either too battered or <b>too</b> <b>distant</b> to pursue. Alceste and Active now concentrated their full broadsides on Pomone, which soon lost both masts and was forced to surrender to prevent total destruction. Pauline escaped, later reaching Ancona safely but having suffered severe damage in the engagement.|$|E

50|$|Recently, it {{has been}} shown be <b>too</b> genetically <b>distant</b> from the Parulidae proper to be {{included}} there with good justification. Instead, DNA evidence supports including it in a family with its sister genus Microligea, and the Phaenicophilus palm-tanagers—and in fact, it looks like rather like a miniature version of Phaenicophilus.|$|R
25|$|Its {{period of}} greatness roughly coincided {{with that of}} the even more eminent Hambledon, not <b>too</b> far <b>distant.</b> Many Alresford players also {{appeared}} for Hambledon, including Tom Taylor, Richard Aubrey Veck and the Freemantle brothers, Andrew and John. Some of Hambledon's matches, even including some fixtures with All-England, were played at Alresford.|$|R
5|$|By the 16th {{century the}} castle was {{becoming}} less fashionable as a residence. Goodrich was <b>too</b> <b>distant</b> from London to {{be a useful}} power base, and was gradually abandoned in favour of more stylish residences, Goodrich continued {{to be used as}} a judicial centre however; the antiquarian John Leland noted that some of the castle was used to hold prisoners for the local court during the 1530s, and the castle ditch was sometimes used to store confiscated cattle taken from local farmers.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, the Estonian {{astronomer}} Ernst Öpik gave {{a distance}} determination {{that supported the}} theory that the Andromeda Nebula is indeed a distant extra-galactic object. Using the new 100inch Mt. Wilson telescope, Edwin Hubble was able to resolve the outer parts of some spiral nebulae as collections of individual stars and identified some Cepheid variables, thus allowing him to estimate the distance to the nebulae: they were far <b>too</b> <b>distant</b> {{to be part of the}} Milky Way. In 1936 Hubble produced a classification of galactic morphology that is used to this day.|$|E
5|$|In late 1758 Brilliant {{joined a}} Royal Navy {{squadron}} supporting amphibious raids along the French coastline. In company with other frigates she protected fleet transports and bomb vessels and assisted with shore bombardment in the Battle of Saint Cast on 11 September 1758. The progenitor of the Royal Geographic Society, James Rennell, was a midshipman aboard Brilliant {{during this period}} and produced his first coastal map while the frigate was stationed off Saint Cast. Brilliant played an undistinguished role in this engagement as her draught was too deep for her to approach the shore. By {{the afternoon of the}} battle she was close enough to the beach for her crew to witness the surrounding and defeat of the British Grenadier Guards, but was <b>too</b> <b>distant</b> to range her guns onto their French assailants.|$|E

60|$|And here, {{while waiting}} {{the coming of}} Johnny Upright, let me explain my errand. While living, eating, and {{sleeping}} {{with the people of}} the East End, it was my intention to have a port of refuge, not <b>too</b> far <b>distant,</b> into which could run now and again to assure myself that good clothes and cleanliness still existed. Also in such port I could receive my mail, work up my notes, and sally forth occasionally in changed garb to civilisation.|$|R
5|$|Other {{atmospheric}} observations {{included a}} swirling dark oval of high atmospheric-haze, {{about the size}} of the Great Red Spot, near Jupiter's north pole. Infrared imagery revealed aspects of circulation near the poles, with bands of globe-encircling winds, and adjacent bands moving in opposite directions. The same announcement also discussed the nature of Jupiter's rings. Light scattering by particles in the rings showed the particles were irregularly shaped (rather than spherical) and likely originated as ejecta from micrometeorite impacts on Jupiter's moons, probably on Metis and Adrastea. On December 19, 2000, the Cassini spacecraft captured a very-low-resolution image of the moon Himalia, but it was <b>too</b> <b>distant</b> to show any surface details.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsequent}} events {{remain in}} dispute. Henry Davis, a teenage black employee of Oscar Davis, maintained that Odell Waller had fired at Oscar Davis without provocation or warning, hitting him four times. Oscar Davis's sons testified {{that their father}} had stated before he died that Waller had shot him without cause. One son added that Davis had said Waller had continued to shoot after Davis had already fallen to the ground. The testimony of other witnesses, including Waller's relatives, was inconclusive, as they were <b>too</b> <b>distant</b> to hear the conversation between Waller and Davis. Waller stated that Davis had refused to let him take the Waller family share of the wheat, and had reached for his pocket as if to draw a gun; Waller then fired on Davis.|$|E
5|$|This {{confusion}} {{in the identification of}} the site has hindered study. The Chajoma capital has been investigated archaeologically, under the assumption that it was the Poqomam capital. Although the Chajoma ruins of Jilotepeque Viejo have been well described archaeologically, the archaeological data has been associated with the history of a different site entirely. Doubts about the identification of the archaeological site were first raised by Robert M. Carmack, who realised that the supposed Poqomam capital was not located within the Poqomam linguistic area but rather within the linguistic area of the Kaqchikels. The Poqomam who were settled in the new colonial settlement of Mixco by the Spanish had a long history of fine polychrome ceramic production, but no evidence of such production had been recovered during archaeological investigations, and the ruins were considered <b>too</b> <b>distant</b> from colonial Mixco.|$|E

50|$|Shun {{felt that}} the land north of Ji Province was too wide, so he created Bing Province; Yan and Qi were <b>too</b> vast and <b>distant,</b> so he formed You Province out of Yan, and Ying Province out of Qi, hence there were the Twelve Provinces.|$|R
5|$|When I Airborne Corps was {{committed}} to action in Operation Market Garden in September 1944, Browning's rift with Brereton had severe repercussions. Browning {{was concerned about the}} timetable put forward by Major-General Paul L. Williams of the IX Troop Carrier Command, under which the drop was staggered over several days, and not to make two drops on the first day. This restricted the number of combat troops available on the first day. He also disagreed with the British drop zones proposed by Air Vice Marshal Leslie Hollinghurst of No. 38 Group, which he felt were <b>too</b> <b>distant</b> from the bridge at Arnhem, but Browning now felt unable to challenge the airmen.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, {{he wrote}} and {{published}} privately a pamphlet This is the World that Man Made, or The New Creation that {{was influenced by the}} rationalist writing of Ray Lankester. In it Pick was pessimistic that mankind was not achieving its creative potential. He returned to the subject in lectures he gave in the 1930s when he outlined his concern that at some not <b>too</b> <b>distant</b> point progress in civilisation would come to a natural end and a stable condition would arise where, he believed, {{it would be hard to}} maintain creativity and an entropic decline would follow. Later, in the last year of his life and with the Second World War under way, he published two booklets on post war reconstruction, Britain Must Rebuild and Paths to Peace. Pick wrote the introduction to the English translation of Walter Gropius's The New Architecture and the Bauhaus published in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Ethalion {{took over}} pursuit of Bellone from Melampus, {{and for two}} hours {{maintained}} continuous fire with her bow-chasers on the French ship. Ethalion was faster than her quarry, and she slowly pulled parallel with Bellone during the afternoon, but could not get close enough for a decisive blow. It took another two hours of pursuit before the battered Bellone eventually surrendered. Hoche apart, Bellone had suffered more casualties than any other ship present. To the south of this conflict, the struggling Anson discovered herself in danger when the surviving frigates of the French vanguard swept towards her en masse. Captain Durham was initially confused by their approach {{as he had been}} <b>too</b> <b>distant</b> to witness the action and the French ships flew false British ensigns, but he rapidly realised their true identity and at 16:00 opened fire on Loire. The damaged Anson was severely hampered by her inability to manoeuvre, and so could do nothing when the French ships pulled back and sailed away, except to continue to fire until they were out of range. During the evening, the surviving French frigates gradually pulled away from their pursuers and disappeared into the gathering night, leaving behind four of their squadron, including their flagship, as captives.|$|E

5|$|In 483BC, {{a massive}} new seam of silver {{was found in}} the Athenian mines at Laurium. Themistocles {{proposed}} that the silver should be used to build a new fleet of 200 triremes, while Aristides suggested it should instead be distributed among the Athenian citizens. Themistocles avoided mentioning Persia, deeming that it was <b>too</b> <b>distant</b> a threat for the Athenians to act on, and instead focused their attention on Aegina. At the time, Athens was embroiled in a long-running war with the Aeginetans, and building a fleet would allow the Athenians to finally defeat them at sea. As a result, Themistocles's motion was carried easily, although only 100 warships of the trireme type were to be built. Aristides refused to countenance this; conversely Themistocles was not pleased that only 100 ships would be built. Tension between the two camps built over the winter, so that the ostracism of 482BC became a direct contest between Themistocles and Aristides. In what has been characterized as the first referendum, Aristides was ostracised, and Themistocles's policies were endorsed. Indeed, becoming aware of the Persian preparations for the coming invasion, the Athenians voted for the construction of more ships than Themistocles had initially asked for. In the run up to the Persian invasion, Themistocles had thus become the foremost politician in Athens.|$|E

The work was performed with great difficulty, for the guns of the defenders were well served, and a storm of missiles were poured, night and day, into the town and against the batteries. The garrison, which consisted of eight thousand men, were frequently relieved by fresh troops from the sultan's army, and were thus able to maintain their fire with great vigour.|$|R
