5|$|Suzuki's working {{title for}} this second {{autobiography}} was The Outsider, a title intended {{to express the}} author's view of his own role in society. The origin of this outsider feeling comes from isolation suffered at a Japanese Canadian internment camp during World War II. He was imprisoned there for being Japanese but shunned by other Japanese for being a third generation Canadian, speaking only English. His feeling of isolation continued during his early school years when the only other student of Japanese heritage was his twin sister. Suzuki's daughters acknowledged this perception of himself as an outsider but insist that the public views him very differently, {{as one of their}} own, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> The Autobiography title.|$|E
5|$|While most insects {{have three}} simple eyes, or ocelli, only two ocelli {{are present in}} all species of Lepidoptera, except a few moths, {{one on each side}} of the head near the edge of the {{compound}} eye. On some species, sense organs called chaetosemata are found near the ocelli. The ocelli are not homologous <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> eyes of caterpillars which are differently named as stemmata. The ocelli of Lepidoptera are reduced externally in some families; where present, they are unfocussed, unlike stemmata of larvae which are fully focussed. The utility of ocelli is not understood at present.|$|E

25|$|The {{grammar of}} Interlingua has been {{described}} as {{similar to that of the}} Romance languages, but greatly simplified, primarily under the influence of English. More recently, Interlingua's grammar has been likened <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> grammars of Japanese and particularly Chinese.|$|E
25|$|Verb {{derivation}} is done {{by adding}} prefixes or by doubling consonants <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> verb having the root fɛal (Triconsonantal) or faɛlil (Quadriconsonantal). The verb’s root determines the possible derivations. Generally, the patterns used in Verb Derivation {{are the same as}} in Standard Arabic.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of the twentieth century mathematicians took up the axiomatic method, {{strongly}} influenced by David Hilbert's example. The logical formulation of pure mathematics suggested by Bertrand Russell in terms of a quantifier structure of propositions seemed more and more plausible, as large parts of mathematics became axiomatised and thus subject <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> criteria of rigorous proof.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} sets of possessive pronouns. One of them is transparently derived from the set of {{personal}} pronouns plus a connexive suffix –íín. Another set is less clearly related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> personal pronouns; all possessive pronouns of this set bear a High tone. The third set {{is derived from the}} second set by appending the nominalizing suffix -ní.|$|E
25|$|Another solution, {{especially}} for receiving antennas, {{is to use}} common 300Ω twin lead {{in conjunction with a}} folded dipole. The folded dipole is similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> half-wave dipole but with the feedpoint impedance multiplied by 4, thus closely matching that 300Ω impedance. This is the most common household antenna for fixed FM broadcast band tuners, which usually include balanced 300Ω antenna input terminals.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{there were a}} number of {{aperture}} numbering systems designed with the goal of making exposure times vary in direct or inverse proportion with the aperture, rather than with the square of the f-number or inverse square of the apertal ratio or intensity ratio. But these systems all involved some arbitrary constant, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> ratio of focal length and diameter.|$|E

25|$|England's group {{games in}} the World Cup 2011 were watched by up to four million viewers on German television, but less than a million on BBC, which means even with no German involvement, England games are at this point more popular in Germany than in the country the England team {{actually}} represents. Observers do not lead this gap in popularity back {{to a lack of}} gender equality in England, but <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> fact, that the German women's team is far more successful, and therefore women's football is in the focus of media coverage in Germany.|$|E
25|$|In {{the coat}} of arms (either seal or blazon), the aurochs was {{initially}} a crest over a helmet and party per pale escutcheon, charged with either fleur-de-lis dexter and bars sinister (interpreted as being alternating vert and or) or the Patriarchal cross dexter (closely resembling the Cross of Lorraine in usual renditions) and fleur-de-lis sinister. In time reduced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> depiction of an aurochs head on escutcheon, it was featured alongside the arms of Wallachia and Transylvania on Michael the Brave's seal, as well as only alongside Wallachia's on various symbols favored by rulers such as Radu Mihnea and several Phanariotes (in the latter case, it was {{more often than not}} accompanied by the double-headed eagle of Byzantine tradition).|$|E
25|$|His {{home was}} evidently one of rude comfort and plenty, {{sufficiently}} {{in the country}} to afford him the amusements of hunting and fishing, which he often recalls with keen pleasure, and sufficiently near the town to afford him the companionship of many comrades, the few survivors of whom he looks forward to meeting again after his thirty-four years' absence (x. 104). The memories of this old home, and of other spots, the rough names and local associations which he delights to introduce into his verse, attest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> pleasures of his early life and were among the influences which kept his spirit alive in the stultifying routines of upper-crust social life in Rome.|$|E

25|$|In German orthography, the umlauted vowels ä, ö, and ü {{historically}} {{arose from}} ae, oe, ue ligatures (strictly, from superscript e, viz. aͤ, oͤ, uͤ). It is common practice {{to replace them}} with ae, oe, ue digraphs when the diacritics are unavailable, for example in electronic conversation. Phone books treat umlauted vowels as equivalent to the relevant digraph (so that a name Müller will appear {{at the same place}} as if it were spelled Mueller; German surnames have a strongly fixed orthography, either a name is spelled with ü or with ue); however, the alphabetic order used in other books treats them as equivalent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> letters a, o and u. The convention in Scandinavian languages and Finnish is different: there the umlaut vowels are treated as independent letters with positions {{at the end of the}} alphabet.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, a {{different}} model called the opponent process model was proposed. This model explained {{that these two}} processes opposed each other to produce sleep, as against Borbely's model. According to this model, the SCN, which {{is involved in the}} circadian rhythm, enhances wakefulness and opposes the homeostatic rhythm. In opposition is the homeostatic rhythm, regulated via a complex multisynaptic pathway in the hypothalamus that acts like a switch and shuts off the arousal system. Both effects together produce a see-saw like effect of sleep and wakefulness. More recently, it has been proposed that both models have some validity to them, while new theories hold that inhibition of NREM sleep by REM could also play a role. In any case, the two process mechanism adds flexibility <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> circadian rhythm and could have evolved as an adaptive measure.|$|E
25|$|Key to {{the rituals}} {{associated}} with the Grito is the gift, given by Chilean writer Gabriela Mistral to Albizu's family, of a tamarind tree obtained from Simón Bolívar's estate in Venezuela. The tree was planted at the Plaza de la Revolución with soil taken from the eighteen other Spanish-speaking Latin American countries. Albizu meant to give the Plaza a living symbol of solidarity with the struggle for freedom and independence initiated by Bolivar (who, while visiting Vieques, promised to assist the Puerto Rico independence movement, but whose promise never materialized due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> fact that most Puerto Ricans {{did not want the}} island's independence from Spain), as well {{as a symbol of the}} bittersweet (as the trees' fruit) hardships needed to reach Puerto Rico's independence. As such, the Tamarindo de Don Pedro was meant to resemble the Gernikako Arbola in the Basque Country between Spain and France.|$|E
