5|$|As {{the signal}} {{passes through the}} satellite, it is {{translated}} by—added to—a signal generated by an oscillator in the satellite. Although the oscillator is housed in a <b>temperature-controlled</b> enclosure, it is subjected to thermal variation throughout the day that results in minor changes {{in the frequency of}} the translation signal. The thermal variation results from the rotation of the satellite relative to the sun over a given 24-hour period, including the time the satellite passes through the Earth's shadow (which affected the 3:40 and 4:26 handshakes), and is complicated by the use of heaters that run when the oscillator temperature exits pre-determined limits. The variation in the translation frequency was calculated over several days, including the day of Flight 370's disappearance, and could be factored into the BFO measurement.|$|E

Various species of pacu are increasingly being used for warm-water farm fishing around the world. Pacu are considered ideal for their tolerance of the low-oxygen water in farm ponds. They also don't {{require a lot of}} expensive protein in their diet, and can be raised year-round in warm or <b>temperature-controlled</b> environments.|$|E
25|$|Blake's Barn is an 18th-century {{structure}} that was relocated and reconfigured specifically for preservation activity. This facility was donated by stage and screen dancer/actress Marge Champion and is {{named in honor}} of her late son. In addition to a central area for exhibits and lectures, the building houses a reading room with video stations providing access to the moving image collection. The lower level contains <b>temperature-controlled</b> storage areas and video production equipment.|$|E
25|$|External or {{curbside}} letter {{boxes are}} not <b>temperature-controlled,</b> {{and this can}} sometimes be a concern for temperature-sensitive products such as pharmaceuticals, live plants or other organisms, or chocolate candies. Conditions can include high or low temperatures outside of the recommended storage conditions for certain products. For example, the USFDA found that the temperature in a steel mailbox painted black could reach 136°F (58°C) in full sun while the ambient air temperature was 101°F (38°C).|$|E
25|$|Mead’s biggest {{contribution}} to orchidology, after over 25 years of orchid growing, came when Lewis Knudson of Cornell University approached him for advice and assistance in experiments he was performing {{related to the}} possible non-symbiotic germination of orchid seed. By then Mead had realized that germination rates could be made more favorable in a sterile and <b>temperature-controlled</b> environment akin to clean room conditions in a laboratory. Knudson’s breakthrough involved the use of sterilized agar containing nutrients to achieve reproducible orchid seed germination.|$|E

25|$|The Penedès is {{the largest}} and most {{productive}} wine region of Catalonia and is considered the birthplace of Cava. The region has a long winemaking history and its proximity to Barcelona has had a strong export market. In the 19th century {{it was one of the}} first Spanish wine regions to implement a large-scale commercial wine production particularly for export to post-phylloxera France. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Penedès region led in the Spanish wine industry's technological revolution; it was the first wine region to adopt the use of <b>temperature-controlled</b> stainless steel fermentation tanks. The region also began to increase its varieties and improve its vine stock with clonal vine selections of grapes such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Gewürztraminer, Merlot, Pinot noir, Riesling and Sauvignon blanc.|$|E
25|$|For example, a <b>temperature-controlled</b> {{circulating}} bath has two PID controllers in cascade, {{each with}} its own thermocouple temperature sensor. The outer controller controls the temperature of the water using a thermocouple located far from the heater where it accurately reads the temperature of the bulk of the water. The error term of this PID controller is the difference between the desired bath temperature and measured temperature. Instead of controlling the heater directly, the outer PID controller sets a heater temperature goal for the inner PID controller. The inner PID controller controls the temperature of the heater using a thermocouple attached to the heater. The inner controller's error term is the difference between this heater temperature setpoint and the measured temperature of the heater. Its output controls the actual heater to stay near this setpoint.|$|E
25|$|As {{the seals}} can be {{performed}} at much lower temperature than with direct joining of glass parts and without use of flame (using a <b>temperature-controlled</b> kiln or oven), glass solders are useful in applications like subminiature vacuum tubes or for joining mica windows to vacuum tubes and instruments (e.g., Geiger tube). Thermal expansion coefficient has to be matched to the materials being joined and often is chosen in between the coefficients of expansion of the materials. In case of having to compromise, subjecting the joint to compression stresses is more desirable than to tensile stresses. The expansion matching is not critical in applications where thin layers are used on small areas, e.g., fireable inks, or where the joint will be subjected to a permanent compression (e.g., by an external steel shell) offsetting the thermally introduced tensile stresses.|$|E
25|$|The {{upcoming}} import cargo {{storage and}} processing facility would have a capacity to handle almost 8 lakh tonnes of cargo annually from the existing 3 lakh tonnes. The new complex will have an area of 58,000sqm against the current area of 26,000sqm. The conventional way of warehouse management {{will be replaced by}} automated storage and retrieval system (ASRS) The ASRS would have over 8,000 storage bins and each bin would have a capacity to store 1.3 to 1.5 tonnes of cargo in it. Apart from ASRS, the upcoming facilities would also have multiple <b>temperature-controlled</b> cold storages for perishable cargo, with three chambers at 0 to 12°C covering a total area of 445sqm. There would be three fully secured strong rooms for {{storage and processing}} of high value cargo, such as gems, jewellery, gold and silver, both in export and import together. The new facility would also have dedicated isolated storage locations for handling dangerous and hazardous cargo.|$|E
25|$|Thalamotomy, {{involving}} {{the creation of}} lesions in the brain region called the thalamus, is quite effective in treating patients with essential, cerebellar, or Parkinsonian tremor. This in-hospital procedure is performed under local anesthesia, with the patient awake. After the patient’s head is secured in a metal frame, the surgeon maps the patient’s brain to locate the thalamus. A small hole is drilled through the skull and a <b>temperature-controlled</b> electrode is inserted into the thalamus. A low-frequency current is passed through the electrode to activate the tremor and to confirm proper placement. Once the site has been confirmed, the electrode is heated to create a temporary lesion. Testing is done to examine speech, language, coordination, and tremor activation, if any. If no problems occur, the probe is again heated to create a 3-mm permanent lesion. The probe, when cooled to body temperature, is withdrawn and the skull hole is covered. The lesion causes the tremor to permanently disappear without disrupting sensory or motor control.|$|E

500|$|This {{station has}} four High Entrance/Exit Turnstiles and several {{emergency}} exit gates (one {{of which is}} equipped with an AutoGate MetroCard reader), but no token booth or MetroCard Vending Machines. Although MetroCards can technically be purchased at any subway station in the system, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) considers the station to be linked with Aqueduct–North Conduit Avenue located approximately [...] to the south, which has a full-time token booth and MetroCard machines. Two wide staircases and the elevator lead down from platform level to the parking lots {{in front of the}} racetrack. A sidewalk on the western side of Aqueduct Road leads south from Aqueduct Racetrack to the North Conduit Avenue station; the main fare control area is located {{at the south end of}} that station at North Conduit Avenue. At the north end of the passageway at Pitkin Avenue is a gate which, when open, allows access between the station and racetrack and the local community. The glass-enclosed bridge, called the [...] "SkyBridge", is <b>temperature-controlled</b> and provides another ADA-accessible entrance into the station. It leads directly to the Resorts World Casino. Formerly, the only entrance to the station was through a large wide passageway (similar to those at Mets–Willets Point), which led directly to the racetrack.|$|E
2500|$|The 20th century {{saw many}} {{advances}} in winemaking technology and practices—particularly {{the introduction of}} <b>temperature-controlled</b> fermentation and controlled inducing of malolactic fermentation. One winemaking issue that is still contested {{in the region is}} the use of oak. Historically Chablis was aged in old wooden feuillette barrels that were essentially neutral: they did not impart the characteristic oak flavors (vanilla, cinnamon, toast, coconut, etc.) that are today associated with ageing a wine in barrels. Hygiene was difficult to control with these older barrels, and they could develop faults in the wine, including discoloration. These old barrels fell out of favor, replaced by stainless steel fermentation tanks which also controlled temperatures.|$|E
2500|$|All saddles {{need to be}} kept {{clean and}} dry. [...] They need to be stored under cover, away from weather and dust. [...] Ideally they should be stored {{in an area where}} they are kept at a {{slightly}} cool but consistent temperature, though the practical need to keep saddles near horses may make <b>temperature-controlled</b> storage difficult. [...] Saddles also need to be kept away from a direct heat source, such as a furnace duct or heater, as excess heat, especially driven by a fan, will dry out the leather. [...] For the same reason, if leather gets wet, it must be allowed to dry naturally, away from a direct heat source. [...] A properly cared-for saddle can last for many decades, even with regular use.|$|E
2500|$|... lyophilizing and wire-heating {{process is}} another method of {{creating}} longitudinally oriented channels, developed by Huang et al. (2005). A chitosan and acetic acid solution was frozen around nickel-copper (Ni-Cu) wires in a liquid nitrogen trap; subsequently the wires were heated and removed. Ni-Cu wires were chosen {{because they have}} a high resistance level. <b>Temperature-controlled</b> lyophilizers were used to sublimate the acetic acid. There was no evidence of the channels merging or splitting. After lyophilizing, scaffold dimensions shrunk causing channels to be a bit smaller than the wire used. The scaffolds were neutralized to a physiological pH value using a base, which had dramatic effects on the porous structure. Weaker bases kept the porous structure uniform, but stronger base made it uncontrollable. The technique used here can be slightly modified to accommodate other polymers and solvents.|$|E
2500|$|Von Sterneck and Mendenhall gravimeters: In 1887 Austro-Hungarian {{scientist}} Robert von Sterneck {{developed a}} small gravimeter pendulum mounted in a <b>temperature-controlled</b> vacuum tank {{to eliminate the}} effects of temperature and air pressure. It used a [...] "half-second pendulum," [...] having a period close to one second, about 25cm long. [...] The pendulum was nonreversible, so the instrument was used for relative gravity measurements, but their small size made them small and portable. The period of the pendulum was picked off by reflecting {{the image of an}} electric spark created by a precision chronometer off a mirror mounted {{at the top of the}} pendulum rod. The Von Sterneck instrument, and a similar instrument developed by Thomas C. Mendenhall of the US Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1890, were used extensively for surveys into the 1920s.|$|E
2500|$|Detroit's William Davis {{patented}} {{a refrigerator}} car that employed metal racks {{to suspend the}} carcasses above a frozen mixture of ice and salt. In 1868, he sold the design [...] to George H. Hammond, a Detroit meat packer, who built a set of cars to transport his products to Boston using ice from the Great Lakes for cooling. The load had the tendency of swinging to one side when the car entered a curve at high speed, {{and use of the}} units was discontinued after several derailments. In 1878 Swift hired engineer Andrew Chase to design a ventilated car that was well insulated, and positioned the ice in a compartment {{at the top of the}} car, allowing the chilled air to flow naturally downward. The meat was packed tightly at the bottom of the car to keep the center of gravity low and to prevent the cargo from shifting. Chase's design proved to be a practical solution, providing <b>temperature-controlled</b> carriage of dressed meats, This allowed Swift and Company to ship their products across the United States and internationally.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the most}} notable {{expression}} of Nebbiolo, the wines of Barolo, there is division between what is considered a [...] "traditional" [...] approach to Nebbiolo and a [...] "modernist" [...] approach. The roots of both styles can trace their history to the early [...] "pre-technology" [...] production of Nebbiolo. Prior to the advent of <b>temperature-controlled</b> fermentation, the late harvest dates for Nebbiolo meant that the wines began fermentation when the weather turned cold. These cool temperatures would delay fermentation for several days, extending the maceration period and extraction of phenolic compounds such as tannins. When fermentation did begin, temperatures would reach excessive levels of 95-100 °F (35-38 °C), which would drastically reduce potential aromas and flavors. With {{the high levels of}} tannins, these early Barolos would require five years or more of aging in oak barrels to soften some of the astringency. Lack of understanding of proper hygiene lead to less sanitary conditions than what both traditional and modernist producers maintain today. Those conditions lead to the development of bacterial infection of cement fermentation tanks and old wood barrels, which contributed to the development of off flavors and potential wine faults that would require at least 24 hours decanting to alleviate.|$|E
2500|$|Refrigeration {{has had a}} large {{impact on}} industry, lifestyle, agriculture, and {{settlement}} patterns. The idea of preserving food dates back to at least the ancient Roman and Chinese empires. However, mechanical refrigeration technology has rapidly evolved in the last century, from ice harvesting to <b>temperature-controlled</b> rail cars. The introduction of refrigerated rail cars contributed to the westward expansion of the United States, allowing settlement in areas that were not on main transport channels such as rivers, harbors, or valley trails. Settlements were also developing in infertile parts of the country, filled with newly discovered [...] natural resources. These new settlement patterns sparked the building of large cities which are able to thrive in areas that were otherwise thought to be inhospitable, such as Houston, Texas, and Las Vegas, Nevada. [...] In most developed countries, cities are heavily dependent upon refrigeration in supermarkets, {{in order to obtain}} their food for daily consumption. The increase in food sources has led to a larger concentration of agricultural sales coming from a smaller percentage of existing farms. Farms today have a much larger output per person in comparison to the late 1800s. This has resulted in new food sources available to entire populations, which has had a large impact on the nutrition of society.|$|E
2500|$|The {{meat was}} packed tightly {{at the bottom}} of the car to keep the center of gravity low and to prevent the cargo from shifting. Chase's design proved to be a {{practical}} solution to providing <b>temperature-controlled</b> carriage of dressed meats, and allowed Swift & Company to ship their products all over the United States, and even internationally, and in doing so radically altered the meat business. Swift's attempts to sell this design to the major railroads were unanimously rebuffed as the companies feared that they would jeopardize their considerable investments in stock cars and animal pens if refrigerated meat transport gained wide acceptance. In response, Swift financed the initial production run on his own, then [...] when the American railroads refused his business [...] he contracted with the GTR (a railroad that derived little income from transporting live cattle) to haul them into Michigan and then eastward through Canada. In 1880, the Peninsular Car Company (subsequently purchased by American Car & Foundry) delivered to Swift the first of these units, and the Swift Refrigerator Line (SRL) was created. Within a year the Line’s roster had risen to nearly 200 units, and Swift was transporting an average of 3,000 carcasses a week to Boston. Competing firms such as Armour and Company quickly followed suit. By 1920 the SRL owned and operated 7,000 of the ice-cooled rail cars. The General American Transportation Corporation would assume ownership of the line in 1930.|$|E
