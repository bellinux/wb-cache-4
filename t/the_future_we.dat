On 25 February 2008, Boris Tadić met with Dmitry Medvedev and Sergei Lavrov in Belgrade where Medvedev stated that “We proceed from the understanding that Serbia is a single state with its jurisdiction spanning its entire territory, and we will adhere to this principled stance in <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> <b>We</b> have made a deal to coordinate together our efforts in order {{to get out of this}} complicated situation”.

25|$|The {{relationship}} of homo sapiens {{to the other}} animals is one of unremitting exploitation. We employ their work; we eat and wear them. We exploit them to serve our superstitions: whereas we used to sacrifice them to our gods and tear out their entrails in order to foresee <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> <b>we</b> now sacrifice them to science, and experiment on their entail in the hope—or on the mere off chance—that we might thereby see a little more clearly into the present... To us it seems incredible that the Greek philosophers should have scanned so deeply into right and wrong and yet never noticed the immorality of slavery. Perhaps 3000 years from now it will seem equally incredible {{that we do not}} notice the immorality of our own oppression of animals.|$|E

25|$|There are {{problems}} that may hinder the development the modeling of reading behaviours. First, computer models in reading {{tend to make}} assumptions of direct links between lexical properties and saccade attributes (by putting a formula linking the two into the model). These links are descriptive generalizations of existing empirical data and normally do not survive new data. In search for new data to support their models, researcher might have to keep adding and adjusting lexical process assumptions {{and are likely to}} ignore possible parsimonious process that underlies these assumptions. Caution should be taken when adding assumptions of how lexical processes affect saccade programming because reading is not what humans are evolved to do. The modeling of eye-movements in reading should treat reading as special case of visual perception and take into account more basic oculomotor properties(e.g., split fovea, depth perception) before making assumptions about the link between lexical processes and eye movements. Another problem is {{that there has been a}} lack of comparison between models on the same data set. Researcher teams tend to focus on the development of their own model and might not be able to fully appreciate the merits of other models due to the technical difficulties in sharing programs. In <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>we</b> might see unifying model that both explains complex reading behaviors well and is parsimonious enough to be generalizable to other eye-tracking fields such as visual search, scene viewing.|$|E

500|$|A {{highlight}} was Leprince-Ringuet's declaration in {{his closing}} talk that: [...] "...in <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>we</b> must use particle accelerators." [...] With the 3 GeV Cosmotron already in operation at Brookhaven National Laboratory, this declaration reflected {{a consensus among}} the participants. As a result, Rossi's group began to wind down their cloud chamber experiments. [...] However, in 1954, Bridge, Hans Courant, Herbert DeStaebler, Jr. and Rossi reported on an unusual event in which a stopping singly charged particle decayed into three photons whose energies totaled more than the proton rest energy. [...] This is the signature of an antiproton annihilation.

500|$|To other reviewers, Captain Scarlet {{remains a}} [...] "camp classic" [...] that, in Bould's opinion, relates well to other Anderson {{productions}} {{due to a}} common depiction of [...] "a utopian future benefiting from world government, high technology, ethnic diversity, and a generally positive sense of Americanisation. They articulate the commonly made connection between technological developments and economic prosperity." [...] He also states that Captain Scarlet espouses [...] "Euro-cool consumerism". The concept of world government is common to Anderson's work and was inspired by his thoughts on the matter at the time: [...] "I had all sorts of fancy ideas about <b>the</b> <b>future...</b> <b>we</b> had the United Nations and I imagined {{that the world would}} come together and there would be a world government."

The match was refereed by Wilian Rosquet, and judged by Young Chun Jeon and Cathy Mouette. [...] There were no penalties awarded in the match.

[...] She also stated that, because she was not accustomed to fighting in such large tournaments and because of the debate over the hijab, it had been difficult for her to focus on the competition. Despite this, she clarified that she was happy to have participated and planned to continue to practise judo in the future.

The following day, Lucy rejoins the others and goes on to Los Angeles. When they arrive, Kit brings Mimi along to surprise her fiance, Dylan. While alone in the hotel, Lucy gives her virginity to Ben and they fall in love with each other. When Kit and Mimi arrive to Dylan's place, it is revealed that he is cheating on Kit after they see another girl in his apartment. Already upset, Kit suddenly realizes that it was Dylan who raped Mimi and got her pregnant, and she punches him. Scared, Mimi runs away, and falls down the stairs. Consequently, she loses her baby. Because of this, Lucy decides to call her father to take her and the girls back home. However her father is still putting pressure on Lucy to do what he wants. After the entire journey she realizes that everything she's done has been to please her father instead of herself. Lucy tells her father to let her go and she runs after Ben, they embrace and kiss each other. She and the girls decide to stay with Ben and go to the audition. They receive a standing ovation [...] after their performance of Lucy's poem; I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman."This time we didn't make any wishes for <b>the</b> <b>future...</b> <b>We</b> said goodbye to our past.
