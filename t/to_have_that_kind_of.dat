40|$|There {{are many}} ways to pack, and arrange, {{filaments}} in space. The packing can be quantified in terms of how much filament length is contained in a typical unit of volume. How something is “arranged” is harder to define, but one can think in terms of systems that are random as opposed <b>to</b> those <b>that</b> <b>have</b> some <b>kinds</b> of regularity. We identify three fundamental regimes of packing (linear, laminar, globular) and illustrate how several different real and virtual filament systems fall into these three regimes. The amount of entanglement in a filament system is an essential property, strongly influencing physical behavior. There are different ways to try to quantify entanglement; we focus here on average crossing number. We present several models of filaments and analyze the typical tangling behavior in the different packing regimes. We conclude with an example comparing the tangling effects of random and orderly packing...|$|R

2500|$|A legend is that Lincoln {{is shown}} using sign {{language}} to represent his initials, {{with his left}} hand shaped to form an [...] "A" [...] and his right hand to form an [...] "L". The National Park Service denies both stories, calling them urban legends. However, historian Gerald Prokopowicz writes that, while {{it is not clear that}} sculptor Daniel Chester French intended for Lincoln's hands to be formed into sign language versions of his initials, it is possible that French did intend it, because he was familiar with American Sign Language, and he would have had a reason to do so, i.e., to pay tribute to Lincoln for having signed the federal legislation giving Gallaudet University, a university for the deaf, the authority to grant college degrees. The National Geographic Society's publication, On This Spot: Pinpointing the Past in Washington, D.C., states that French had a son who was deaf, and the sculptor was familiar with sign language. Historian James A. Percoco has observed that, although there are no extant documents showing that French carved Lincoln's hands to represent the letters [...] "A" [...] and [...] "L" [...] in American Sign Language, [...] "I think you can conclude that it's reasonable <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> summation about the hands." ...|$|E
2500|$|Taylor had {{thoughts}} of retiring {{by the time}} he played the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro in January 1985. He was encouraged by the nascent democracy in Brazil at the time, buoyed by the positive reception he got from the large crowd and other musicians, and musically energized by the sounds and nature of Brazilian music. [...] "I had... sort of bottomed-out in a drug habit, my marriage with Carly had dissolved, and I had basically been depressed and lost for a while," [...] he recalled in 1995. [...] "I sort of hit a low spot. I was asked to go down to Rio de Janeiro to play in this festival down there. We put the band together and went down and it was just an amazing response. I played to 300,000 people. They not only knew my music, they knew things about it and were interested in aspects of it that to that point had only interested me. <b>To</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> validation right about then was really what I needed. It helped get me back on track." [...] The song [...] "Only a Dream in Rio" [...] was written in tribute to that night, with lines like I was there that very day and my heart came back alive. The October 1985 album, That's Why I'm Here, from which that song came, started a series of studio recordings that, while spaced further apart than his previous records, showed a more consistent level of quality and fewer covers, most notably the Buddy Holly song [...] "Everyday", released as a single reached No. 61.

The data from this study suggests that testing accommodations provide a positive influence on learning and test taking, however, the nursing students reported challenges and stressors related to receiving approval. One of the challenges reported was the requirement to receive a diagnosis of anxiety from a qualified professional. Taylor shared, “You hear about all these people going to the doctor just to get on meds and abusing the thing, so you kind of think they’re gonna go like, ‘That chick’s crazy.’” Emerson shared similar concerns saying, “I was worried that my doctor was going to think that I was faking it—like my anxiety wasn’t real and he was just going to tell me to get over it.” These students expressed concern about the process {{and whether or not they}} would receive the needed diagnosis. Similarly, students worried about the additional cost incurred by the required professional evaluation requirement. The international students in particular cited inadequate healthcare coverage and therefore, paid more for the evaluation.

40|$|According to the Law on Cooperatives of 1990 {{property}} that {{was owned by}} cooperatives and associations of cooperatives after 01 July 1953, and which is through organizational and statutory changes or otherwise transferred without compensation to other users who are not cooperative or cooperative associations {{will be returned to}} the same types of cooperative whose property had been, and if there is none, then the cooperative of the same type operating in the area in which it operated cooperative that owned the property for which restitution is requested. Such a provision is in practice led to numerous problems. On the one hand, the return of confiscated property represents redress, if they meet all legal requirements. But on the other hand, the law leaves room for abuse. It is possible that the property 'returns' to persons who are subsequently formed a cooperative in the same area, as the legal successor does not exist and that it should be given to assets with which they have no legal or real connection. It is therefore necessary to interpret restrictively the conditions for the return of cooperative property and take into account the inviolability of private property if the property of cooperative has become with compensation someone's private property. In any case, the right to return can only belong <b>to</b> entities <b>that</b> <b>have</b> some <b>kind</b> of legal succession with the cooperative of which property was confiscated...|$|R
6000|$|There were {{shade trees}} {{all along that}} street, that you could climb if you wanted to, or that you could lie down under when you had run {{yourself}} out of breath, or play mumble-the-peg. My boy distinctly remembered that under one of these trees his elder brother first broached to him that awful scheme of reform about fibbing, and applied to their own lives the moral of [...] "The Trippings of Tom Pepper;" [...] he remembered how a conviction of the righteousness of the scheme sank into his soul, {{and he could not}} withhold his consent. Under the same tree, and very likely at the same time, a solemn conclave of boys, all the boys there were, discussed the feasibility of tying a tin can to a dog's tail, and seeing how he would act. They had all heard of the thing, but none of them had seen it; and it was not so much a question of whether you ought to do a thing that on the very face of it would be so much fun, and if it did not amuse the dog as highly as anybody, could certainly do him no harm, as {{it was a question of}} whose dog you should get to take the dog's part in the sport. It was held that an old dog would probably not keep still long enough for you to tie the can on; he would have his suspicions; or else he would not run when the can was tied on, but very likely just go and lie down somewhere. The lot finally fell to a young yellow dog belonging to one of the boys, and the owner at once ran home to get him, and easily lured him back to the other boys with flatteries and caresses. The flatteries and caresses were not needed, for a dog is always glad to go with boys, upon any pretext, and so far from thinking that he does them a favor, he feels himself greatly honored. But I dare say the boy had a guilty fear that if his dog had known why he was invited to be of that party of boys, he might have pleaded a previous engagement. As it was, he came joyfully, and allowed the can to be tied to his tail without misgiving. If there had been any question with the boys as to whether he would enter fully into the spirit of the affair, it must have been instantly dissipated by the dog's behavior when he felt the loop tighten on his tail, and looked round to see what the matter was. The boys hardly had a chance to cheer him before he flashed out of sight round the corner, and they hardly had time to think before he flashed into sight again from the other direction. He whizzed along the ground, and the can hurtled in the air, but there was no other sound, and the cheers died away on the boys' lips. The boy who owned the dog began to cry, and the other fellows began to blame him for not stopping the dog. But he might as well have tried to stop a streak of lightning; the only thing you could do was to keep out of the dog's way. As an experiment it was successful beyond the wildest dreams of its projectors, though it would have been a sort of relief if the dog had taken some other road, for variety, or had even reversed his course. But he kept on as he began, and by a common impulse the boys made up their minds to abandon the whole affair to him. They all ran home and hid, or else walked about and tried to ignore it. But at this point the grown-up people began to be interested; the mothers came to their doors to see what was the matter. Yet even the mothers were powerless in a case like that, and the enthusiast had to be left to his fate. He was found under a barn at last, breathless, almost lifeless, and he tried to bite the man who untied the can from his tail. Eventually he got well again, and lived to be a solemn warning to the boys; he was touchingly distrustful of their advances for a time, but he finally forgot and forgave everything. They did not forget, and they never tried tying a tin can to a dog's tail again, among all the things they tried and kept trying. Once was enough; and they never even liked to talk of it, the sight was so awful. They were really fond of the dog, and if they could have thought he would take the matter so seriously, they would not have tried <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> fun with him. It cured them of ever wanting <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> fun with any dog.|$|E
