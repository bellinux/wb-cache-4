500|$|Reagan {{feels that}} Armageddon is {{inevitable}} and it's dangerous {{when you have a}} President who thinks that way since he's the one who can call for the pushing of the button. He sees himself in his personal drama, I think, increasingly as a religious leader and he has public lunches with some of these very powerful evangelists, Pat Robertson and The 700 Club for instance. In other words, you have the church stroking Reagan and saying [...] "Yes, yes, aren't <b>they</b> <b>saying</b> nasty things about you, they must be communists. Therefore they threaten both you and me. Don't you think we should silence these communists from speaking?" ...|$|E
500|$|A deleted {{scene from}} early on within the episode, in which Scully {{questions}} her doctor about her ultrasound scans, {{was cut from}} the final broadcast as writer Frank Spotnitz felt it was too [...] "confusing" [...] for the viewers to place doubt on {{the actions of the}} doctor so early. Fellow series writer John Shiban said that the scene was not [...] "subtle" [...] enough to convey the right level of suspicion. Spotnitz has described [...] "Per Manum" [...] as being [...] "a real paranoia episode", concerning [...] "the way you perceive connections between people, what are <b>they</b> <b>saying,</b> and is it suspicious or not".|$|E

500|$|... "Don't Judge Me" [...] is a midtempo ballad {{that runs}} {{for three minutes}} and fifteen seconds, with {{instrumentation}} provided by drums. Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush noted that [...] "Don't Judge Me" [...] features [...] "a slow, sensuous romp", which she found reminiscent of Michael Jackson. Lyrically, Brown asks his lover to forgive him [...] "for his past indiscretions" [...] and [...] "move on with the future." [...] In the song, Brown encourages his lover {{that there is nothing}} going on between him and his ex-girlfriend as he sings, [...] "You're hearing rumors about me / And you can't stomach the thought / Of someone touching my body / When you're so close to my heart / I won't deny what <b>they</b> <b>saying</b> / Because most of it is true / But it was all before I fell for you." [...] He later declares [...] "that he is a changed man who can now be trusted" [...] as shown in the lines, [...] "Take me as I am / Not who I was / I'll promise I'll be / The one that you can trust." [...] During the chorus, Brown sings [...] "So please don't judge me / and I won't judge you / because it could get ugly / before it gets beautiful." [...] Mesfin Fekadu of the Associated Press noted that Brown [...] "sings in his signature semi-high pitch", and critics speculated that the lyrics were about Brown's former relationships with aspiring American model and fashion designer Karrueche Tran and Barbadian recording artist Rihanna. Holly Frith of Entertainment Wise noted that Rihanna [...] "may be the inspiration" [...] for the lyrics. Rolling Stones Maura Johnston described [...] "Don't Judge Me" [...] as [...] "a tender love song," [...] Album Reviews|work=Rolling Stone|date=2012-07-16|accessdate=2012-08-16}} while Andrew Hampp of Billboard magazine referred to it as a [...] "take me as I am" [...] type of ballad. Hazel Robinson of California Literary Review noted that [...] "Don't Judge Me" [...] is similar to Brown's 2009 song, [...] "Changed Man." ...|$|E

2500|$|Soon {{after his}} meeting with Bukharin, the {{telephone}} rang in Pasternak's Moscow apartment. A voice from The Kremlin said, [...] "Comrade Stalin wishes to speak with you." [...] According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak was struck dumb. [...] "He was totally unprepared for such a conversation. But then he heard his voice, the voice of Stalin, coming over the line. The Leader addressed him in a rather bluff uncouth fashion, using the familiar thou form: 'Tell me, what are <b>they</b> <b>saying</b> in your literary circles about the arrest of Mandelstam?'" [...] Flustered, Pasternak denied {{that there was any}} discussion or that there were any literary circles left in Soviet Russia. Stalin went on to ask him for his own opinion of Mandelstam. In an [...] "eager fumbling manner" [...] Pasternak explained that he and Mandelstam each had a completely different philosophy about poetry. Stalin finally said, in a mocking tone of voice: [...] "I see, you just aren't able to stick up for a comrade," [...] and put down the receiver.|$|E

'I obey,' said Rupert, with a funny face of submission, {{and taking}} up his paper and pencil; {{but in a}} minute or two he started up, exclaiming, 'What are <b>they</b> <b>saying</b> about Oxford?' and walked into the next room, {{intending}} {{to take part in the}} conversation between his father and uncle. Mr. Woodbourne, however, who was no great admirer of Rupert's forwardness, did not shew so much deference to his nephew's opinion as to make him very unwilling to return to the inner drawing-room, when Anne came to tell him that all the poems were finished, and Elizabeth ready to read them aloud.|$|E

5000|$|Christianity {{was viewed}} by Periyar similar to monotheistic faith of Islam. He stated that, [...] "So far as god is {{concerned}} {{we find the}} Christians and Muslims, somewhat reformed from the olden days of barbarians. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> {{that there can be}} only one god. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> that it is beyond human comprehension. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> that god does good to those who are good and punishes those who are bad. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> that god has no name or shape. They talk of good qualities". He took an interest in Rev. Martin Luther, where both he and his followers wanted to liken him and his role to that of the European reformer.|$|R
60|$|Gossip raged, of course. Far {{from being}} disturbed, we used it, so to speak, as a handle for our love-making, which was carried on in an {{inferential}} {{rather than a}} direct fashion. Were <b>they</b> <b>saying</b> that we were lovers? Delightful! We laughed at {{one another in the}} sunshine.... At last we achieved the great adventure of a clandestine meeting and went for a walk in the afternoon, avoiding the houses of our friends. I've forgotten which of us had the boldness to propose it. The crocuses and tulips had broken the black mould, the flower beds in the front yards were beginning to blaze with scarlet and yellow, the lawns had turned a living green. What did we talk about? The substance has vanished, only the flavour remains.|$|E
60|$|Every word sounded quite {{distinctly}} in Terence's ears; {{but what}} were <b>they</b> <b>saying,</b> {{and who were}} they talking to, and who were they, these fantastic people, detached somewhere {{high up in the}} air? Now that they had drunk their tea, they rose and leant over the bow of the boat. The sun was going down, and the water was dark and crimson. The river had widened again, and they were passing a little island set like a dark wedge {{in the middle of the}} stream. Two great white birds with red lights on them stood there on stilt-like legs, and the beach of the island was unmarked, save by the skeleton print of birds' feet. The branches of the trees on the bank looked more twisted and angular than ever, and the green of the leaves was lurid and splashed with gold. Then Hirst began to talk, leaning over the bow.|$|E

Up the valleys, down the valleys go <b>they,</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "Here {{is a place}} to build a breastwork; here can ye pitch a fort. Here can ye hold the road against an army"--the very roads for which I paid out the rupees monthly. The Government knows, but does nothing. The three other Kings, who were not paid for guarding the Passes, tell them by runner of the bad faith of Bunar and Hilas. When all the evil is done, look you--when these two strangers with the levels and the compasses make the Five Kings to believe that a great army will sweep the Passes tomorrow or the next day--Hill-people are all fools--comes the order to me, Hurree Babu, [...] "Go North and see what those strangers do." [...] I say to Creighton Sahib, [...] "This is not a lawsuit, that we go about to collect evidence."' Hurree returned to his English with a jerk: [...] "'By Jove," [...] I said, [...] "why the dooce do you not issue demi-offeecial orders to some brave man to poison them, for an example? It is, if you permit the observation, most reprehensible laxity on your part." [...] And Colonel Creighton, he laughed at me! It is all your beastly English pride. You think no one dare conspire! That is all tommy-rott.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... 3. That man doth act {{from a legal}} spirit who maketh the {{strictness}} of his {{walking the}} ground of his assurance for eternal life. Some men, all the ground they {{have to believe that}} they shall be saved, it is because they walk not so loose as their neighbours, they are not so bad as others are, and therefore they question not but that they shall do well. Now this is a false ground, and a thing that is verily legal, and savours only of some slight and shallow apprehensions of the old covenant. I call them shallow apprehensions, because they are not right and sound, and are such as will do the soul no good, but beguile it, in that the knowledge of the nature of this covenant doth not appear to the soul, only some commanding power it hath on the soul, which the soul endeavouring to give up itself unto, it doth find some peace and content, and especially if it find itself to be pretty willing to yield itself to its commands. And is not this the very ground of thy hoping that God will save thee from the wrath to come? If one should ask thee what ground thou hast to think thou shalt be saved, wouldst thou not say, Truly, because I have left my sins, and because I am more inclinable to do good, [Do not think that I am against the order of the Gospel]. and to learn, and get more knowledge; I endeavour to walk in church order, as they call it, and therefore I hope God hath done a good work for me, and I hope will save my soul. Alas, alas! this is a very trick of the devil to make souls build the ground of their salvation upon this their strictness, and abstaining from the wickedness of their former lives, and because they desire to be stricter and stricter. Now, if you would know such a man or woman, you shall find them in this frame--namely, when they think their hearts are good, then they think also that Christ will have mercy upon them; but when their corruptions work, then they doubt and scruple until again they have their hearts more ready to do the things contained in the law and ordinances of the Gospel. Again, such men do commonly cheer up their hearts, and encourage themselves still to hope all shall be well, and that because they are not so bad as the rest, but more inclinable than <b>they,</b> <b>saying,</b> I am glad I am not as this publican, but better than he, more righteous than he (Luke 18:11).|$|E
