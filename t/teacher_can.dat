30|$|The central {{teaching}} {{strategy in}} the out-of-class learning component is direct instruction (Bishop and Verleger 2013; Kirvan et al. 2015) focusing on the knowledge levels of remembering and understanding (Lai and Hwang 2016). Students learn the course materials by watching instructional videos. <b>Teachers</b> <b>can</b> provide content notes to guide students’ note-taking (DeSantis et al. 2015) and ensure students have adequately prepared for class meetings (Clark 2015). Toward the end of out-of-class learning, <b>teachers</b> <b>can</b> provide online exercises for learning evaluation (Wang 2016).

At the core of Meiklejohn's effort to create systems that promote democratic citizenship, Nelson argues, is [...] "the paradox of Socratic teaching": how a <b>teacher</b> <b>can</b> make a student want freedom and how a <b>teacher</b> <b>can</b> teach this while respecting the student's freedom in practice.|$|E

500|$|Education and Democracy: The Meaning of Alexander Meiklejohn, 1872–1964 is {{the first}} full {{biography}} of Alexander Meiklejohn written by Adam R. Nelson and published by the University of Wisconsin Press in 2001. The title is not a complete biography but draws from five archives to show Meiklejohn through his own words. A popular figure in the early 20th century who has since faded, Meiklejohn was a philosopher and university president who championed unified knowledge, idealism, and Great Books curricula. The book is split into five sections based on the locations in which Meiklejohn lived: his undergrad, faculty, and administrative years at Brown University, his presidency of Amherst College, his time with the University of Wisconsin Experimental College, and his experience with adult education and free speech advocacy at Berkeley. Nelson portrays Meiklejohn as [...] "contradictory, paradoxical, and quixotic" [...] as he grapples with how {{to encourage students to}} pursue freedom and how a <b>teacher</b> <b>can</b> teach this while respecting student freedom.|$|E
500|$|To Stanford's regret, many of {{his pupils}} who {{achieved}} eminence as composers broke away from his classical, Brahmsian precepts, as he had himself rebelled against Reinecke's conservatism. The composer George Dyson wrote, [...] "In a certain sense the very rebellion he fought was the most obvious fruit of his methods. And in view of what some of these rebels have since achieved, {{one is tempted to}} wonder whether there is really anything better a <b>teacher</b> <b>can</b> do for his pupils than drive them into various forms of revolution." [...] The works of some of Stanford's pupils, including Holst and Vaughan Williams, entered the general repertory in Britain, and to some extent elsewhere, as Stanford's never did. For many years after his death it seemed that Stanford's greatest fame would be as a teacher. Among his achievements at the RCM was the establishment of an opera class, with at least one operatic production every year. From 1885 to 1915 there were 32 productions, all of them conducted by Stanford.|$|E

2500|$|The German {{constitution}} guarantees {{freedom of}} religion, {{but there is}} not a complete {{separation of church and state}} in Germany. Officially recognized religious bodies operate as Körperschaften des öffentlichen Rechts (corporations of public law, as opposed to private). For recognized religious communities, some taxes are collected by the state; this is at the request of the religious community and a fee is charged for the service. Religious instruction is an optional school subject in Germany. The German State understands itself as neutral in matters of religious beliefs, so no <b>teacher</b> <b>can</b> be forced to teach religion. But on the other hand, all who do teach religious instruction need an official permission by their religious community. The treaties with the Holy See are referred to as concordats whereas the treaties with Protestant Churches and umbrellas of Jewish congregations are called [...] "state treaties". Both are the legal framework for cooperation between the religious bodies and the German State at the federal as well as at the state level.|$|E

Some wiki software allows an administrator to stop such edit wars by locking a page from further editing until a {{decision has been made}} on what version of the page would be most appropriate. Some wikis are in a better position than others to control behavior due to governance structures existing outside the wiki.
