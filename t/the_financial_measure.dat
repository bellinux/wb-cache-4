Their emergence constitutes a challenging issue for scholars devoted to the history of financial economics, as well as to fundamental tools of economic analysis. Their history is analysed in a comparative perspective, starting with the neglected contribution of Duvillard as a reference case. More than two centuries ago, this French language scholar developed, by an optimizing analytical machinery, a financial measure technically similar to Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR). In order to assess his theoretical contribution in a comparative perspective, the author will try to briefly account for the different contexts where <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>measure</b> has been invented twice. This approach, indeed, is concerned with the institutional changes and the theoretical developments they fostered. It analyses concepts such as time preference, techniques such as discounting and issues such as the 'reinvestment problem'. On the one hand, the Past (especially around the eighteenth century) and Duvillard's contribution is explored. On the other hand, the Present is reconstructed (in particular the late Fifties and later), especially the recent debate that re-invented the MIRR. This article will conclude with some comparative results.

40|$|In recent years, European {{policy has}} come to include the fight against poverty and social exclusion. In {{the context of the}} Open Method of Coordination, common {{indicators}} of poverty were developed. Often, these indicators are a function of household income. In the scientific literature, by contrast, the multidimensional measurement of poverty has taken on a new lease of life. This paper aims at bridging this gap between science and policy. Can <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>measure</b> of poverty be taken as a proxy of a multidimensional measure of poverty? The answer to this question is found in several steps. First of all, an alternative multidimensional measure of poverty is presented and applied to the data of the ECHP of various European countries. Next, the results of this measure are compared with those of financial poverty. More specifically, the causes of multidimensional and financial poverty and those individuals at risk of multidimensional and financial poverty, are compared. The broad conclusions are, first of all, that financial poverty rates often are higher than multidimensional poverty rates. Secondly, the results of both measures of poverty very seldom contradict, so financial poverty can indeed be used as a proxy of multidimensional poverty. However, and that is the third conclusion: the position of some groups in terms of their risk of poverty is underestimated by the financial poverty measure: this is notably the case for those who are single with children, and those with a precarious health situation. multidimensional poverty; financial poverty; comparison...|$|E

40|$|Entrepreneurship is {{the process}} of {{transforming}} an idea into a tangible product or service that can be traded. High-growth entrepreneurial firms contribute a disproportionate share of all new jobs created by new firms. Past research has shown that a significant percentage of the population in a society is employed in entrepreneurial firms and small businesses. Entrepreneurship drives economic growth by stimulating innovation, by commercializing new technologies, by intensifying competition and by generating employment. Typically seven out of ten new employer firms last at least two years, and about half survive five years. One critical area of study is investigating the factors that contribute to the success of a new venture. Social capital and social networks are two such important determinants of entrepreneurial success. Social Capital is the sum of the actual and potential resources embedded within, available through, and derived from the network of relationships possessed by an individual or social unit (Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998). This study investigates the relationship between the social capital of the firm, its key founders and new venture performance. The independent variables are Social Capital of the firm with its associates, Social Capital of the firm with its customers, Social Capital of the founder in entrepreneurial networks, Social Capital of the founder with his/her alumni networks and Social Capital of the founder with his/her ex-colleagues. These relationships are studied under the framework of ties, trust, obligation and expectations, identification, shared language and shared values. New Venture Performance has been measured using both perceptual measures and financial measures. The perceptual measures used are Employee and Customer Retention & Founders Satisfaction with the venture’s performance. <b>The</b> <b>financial</b> <b>measure</b> used is Revenue normalized by the age of the firm. Data was collected through a questionnaire survey and administered to key founders of 28 software startups in Bangalore. The age of these startups ranged from 1 to 6 years. The results of correlation analysis, T-tests and Mann Whitney tests revealed that only Social Capital of the firm with its business associates and Social Capital of the founder with his/her ex-colleagues are significantly correlated with the new venture performance measured as Employee and Customer Retention. Any network is as good as the people belonging to it. Social networks will be significantly beneficial for entrepreneurial success to the extent of the ability and the willingness of the members in the network to help each other...|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} measurement system (PMS) {{has been a}} salient research topic for many prominent researchers in the accounting and management areas. The performance measures in PMS which have mainly concentrated on <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> dimension, are insufficient for today's competitive business environment to gauge the firm's success. As a result a firm incorporates non-financial <b>measures</b> to supplement <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>measures.</b> Research work has been widely focused on variables that influence both <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> and non-financial performance measures and provided valuable information for the firm's strategic direction. Among the variables, the business strategy, environmental uncertainty and market position have some influence on performance measures. This study empirically explores the influence of these three research variables on <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> dimension using <b>the</b> structural equation modelling (SEM) approach.
