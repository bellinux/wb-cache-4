5|$|On several {{occasions}} during the war, Hines {{was forced to}} make narrow, seemingly impossible, escapes. At one point, he concealed himself in a mattress that was being used at the time; on another occasion, he was confused for the actor and assassin John Wilkes Booth, a dangerous {{case of mistaken identity}} that forced him to flee Detroit in April 1865 by holding a ferry captain at gunpoint. Union agents viewed Hines as <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>they</b> most needed to apprehend, but apart from the time he served at the Ohio Penitentiary in late 1863, he was never captured.|$|E
5|$|Vladislav : The Times {{stated that}} the police have {{identified}} <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>they</b> believe may have poisoned Litvinenko with a fatal polonium dose in {{a cup of tea}} on the fourth-floor room at the Millennium Hotel to discuss a business deal with Dmitry Kovtun and Andrey Lugovoy before going to the bar. These three men were joined in the room later by the mystery figure who was introduced as Vladislav, a man who could help Litvinenko win a lucrative contract with a Moscow-based private security firm.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} Tom Loker {{returns to the}} story. Loker has changed {{as the result of}} being healed by the Quakers. George, Eliza, and Harry have also {{obtained}} their freedom after crossing into Canada. In Louisiana, Uncle Tom almost succumbs to hopelessness as his faith in God is tested by the hardships of the plantation. However, he has two visions, one of Jesus and one of Eva, which renew his resolve to remain a faithful Christian, even unto death. He encourages Cassy to escape, which she does, taking Emmeline with her. When Tom refuses to tell Legree where Cassy and Emmeline have gone, Legree orders his overseers to kill Tom. As Tom is dying, he forgives the overseers who savagely beat him. Humbled by the character of <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>they</b> have killed, both men become Christians. Very shortly before Tom's death, George Shelby (Arthur Shelby's son) arrives to buy Tom's freedom but finds he is too late.|$|E

He pursues Müller and his accomplice Ivan and along the way, Thompson and Thomson try to arrest him again, but he convinces them to follow him. When Müller takes a plane north, Tintin and Snowy try to follow, but hit a storm and crash land in rural Scotland. The detectives commandeer another plane, but discover too late that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>they</b> told to fly it is actually a mechanic who has never flown before, and after a harrowing air-bound odyssey they end up crash-landing into (and winning) an aerobatics competition.|$|E

Bullitt points out that Chalmers was duped by the real Ross, who used Chalmers to fake his own death by setting up Renick (similar in appearance to Ross) to die, then murdered the wife to complete the cover-up.|$|E

25|$|The {{marriage}} contracts {{represented a}} {{protection for the}} women, {{both in terms of}} financial security if anything were to happen to them or their husband, and in terms of having the liberty to annul the promise of marriage if <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>they</b> had chosen proved incompatible. A substantial number of the filles du roi who arrived in New France between 1669 and 1671 cancelled marriage contracts; perhaps the dowry they had received made them disinclined to retain a fiancé with whom they found themselves dissatisfied.|$|E

He died in Suva on 18 April 2004, from complications arising from the stroke. His state funeral, led by Roman Catholic Archbishop Petero Mataca, which was spread out over three days (28 to 30 April) saw an estimated 200,000 people – almost a quarter of Fiji's total population – line the streets to pay their last respects to <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>they</b> regarded as the father of the nation, in an outpouring of public grief not seen since the death of Mara's presidential predecessor, Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau, over a decade earlier.|$|E

25|$|Police {{announced}} in January that the DNA {{from the scene}} had come back as belonging to a male.

25|$|Twenty-five {{cardinals}} {{entered the}} conclave. The {{absence of the}} French element left practically only two contending parties—the young and the old. The former had secretly settled on Giovanni de' Medici; the second openly supported S. Giorgio, England's candidate. The Sacred College had been assembled almost {{a week before the}} first serious scrutiny took place. Many of the cardinals, wishing to temporise and conceal their real intentions, had voted for <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>they</b> considered least likely to have any supporters. As luck would have it, thirteen prelates had selected the same outsider, with the result that they all but elected Arborense, the most worthless nonentity present. This narrow shave gave the Sacred College such a shock that its members determined to come to some agreement which would put matters on a more satisfactory basis for both parties.|$|E
25|$|As Justinian rallied himself, {{he created}} a plan that {{involved}} Narses, a popular eunuch, {{as well as the}} generals Belisarius and Mundus. Carrying a bag of gold given to him by Justinian, the slightly built eunuch entered the Hippodrome alone and unarmed, against a murderous mob that had already killed hundreds. Narses went directly to the Blues' section, where he approached the important Blues and reminded them that Emperor Justinian supported them over the Greens. He also reminded them that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>they</b> were crowning, Hypatius, was a Green. Then, he distributed the gold. The Blue leaders spoke quietly with each other and then they spoke to their followers. Then, in the middle of Hypatius's coronation, the Blues stormed out of the Hippodrome. The Greens sat, stunned. Then, Imperial troops led by Belisarius and Mundus stormed into the Hippodrome, killing the remaining rebels.|$|E

25|$|On Sunday, January 25, 2015, three platoons of {{the elite}} SAF police squad entered the guerrilla enclave of Tukanalipao, Mindanao, Philippines, {{with the goal of}} detaining two {{high-ranking}} Jemaah Islamiyah-affiliated, improvised-explosive-device experts, Zulkifli Abdhir (also known as Marwan) and Abdul Basit Usman. The SAF troops raided the hut where they believed Marwan was located, and <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>they</b> believe to be Marwan engaged them in a firefight and was killed. The SAF initially planned to take his body for identification. However, the shooting alerted the BIFF and MILF 118th Command in the area. The SAF had no time to retrieve the body so they just cut off a finger, took a photo, and left his body there. By 6:18 AM UTC+8 (PST), an SMS message was sent by the Commander of SAF 61D Battalion to SAF Director Getulio Napeñas that they were pinned down at coordinates 6.92489°N 124.52047°E. What followed was a bloody encounter that left 44 SAF, 18 MILF, and 5 BIFF dead.|$|E
25|$|According to {{reporter}} James Renner, Dean Runkle is {{a possible}} prime suspect in the FBI investigation. Multiple witnesses say that he matches <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>they</b> saw with Mihaljevic {{on the day she}} vanished. Runkle also may have volunteered at the Lake Erie Nature and Science Center in Bay Village {{at the time of the}} murder. All four girls who received suspicious phone calls (with Mihaljevic being the last one) had visited it in the weeks before the abduction, and may have written their names and other personal information in the Center's visitor logbook. Runkle denied remembering this to police, but at least eight former students and teacher's aides reported that Runkle had spoken of being present at the center. Although Renner describes Runkle as an eccentric teacher, no hard evidence supports this view. Runkle himself denies any involvement in the murder of Mihaljevic and the FBI has never officially declared him a suspect. Since Runkle is exceptionally well liked as a teacher by many former students, Renner became the subject of strong criticism, unlike anything he had faced from naming previous suspects, when he named Runkle.|$|E
