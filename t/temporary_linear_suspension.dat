40|$|Vibration {{isolators}} {{are needed}} to control the relative displacement, acceleration, or most importantly the transmitted force to the base or to the isolated device. As a general rule, a good vibration isolator should be as soft as possible to reduce the transmitted force, {{and it should be}} hard to limit the relative displacement. Soft suspension provides large relative displacement in resonance zone. To limit the relative displacement while having a soft suspension, a limiting displacement design is needed. There are two practical designs, Hydraulic Engine Mount (HEM) and Piecewise <b>Linear</b> <b>Suspension</b> (PLS) which are being used in industry since 80 s. Hydraulic engine mounts were invented to passively produce a low damping at low amplitude and a high damping at high amplitude. Similarly, piecewise <b>linear</b> <b>suspension</b> were introduced to provide a soft suspension at low amplitude and a hard suspension at high amplitude. Having dual behavior puts both HEM and PLS in the domain of nonlinear system which in turn brings many new phenomena never appeared in linear analysis. This article will review the necessity of having a dual behavior suspension and the design of the two practical designs. However, both of these designs have some challenging and unsolved problems. Introducing the problems opens avenue for supervisors, researchers, and students to direct their research practice and hopefully solve them...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{non-linear}} design method {{based on}} linear quadratic optimal control theory is presented that applies both to linear and (a wide class of) non-linear systems. The method {{is easy to}} apply and results in a globally stabilising, near optimal solution, that can be implemented in real time. The key feature of the design method is the introduction of state-dependence in the weight matrices of the usual linear quadratic cost function, leading to a non-linear design method, even for linear dyanmics. To demonstrate the method, a simple <b>linear</b> <b>suspension</b> model is used, {{in conjunction with a}} non-linear state penalty, which better reflects the engineering objectives of active vehicle vibration suppression.

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{frequency}} response of a piecewise <b>linear</b> <b>suspension</b> system. Dynamical {{characteristics of the}} suspension will suddenly change when its relative displacement exceeds a clearance. Piecewise linear characteristics occur, for example, wherever we use stoppers to prevent the system from excessive relative displacement. A modified averaging method is used to find the frequency response of the system to a harmonic base excitation. A frequency island is observed, which corresponds to large amplitude vibration for a certain range of system parameters. The island is an isolated region that cannot be reached by the variation of excitation frequency and depends upon initial conditions. On the frequency island, the isolator amplifies the amplitude of vibration rather than suppressing it. This will be dangerous in applications where stoppers are installed to ensure relative displacement is limited. The ranges of system parameters causing the frequency island are determined. The results obtained by an analytical method are verified using numerical simulation...|$|R

40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{a method for}} improving vertical whole body vibration isolation through optimal seat suspension parametric design. The primary thrusts of this investigation are: (1) {{the development of a}} simple model that captures the essential dynamics of a seated human exposed to vertical vibration, (2) the selection and evaluation of several standards for assessing human sensitivity to vertical vibration, and (3) the determination of the linear and nonlinear seat suspension parameters that yield optimal vibration isolation. For the <b>linear</b> seat <b>suspension,</b> results show that the optimal seat damping coefficient depends very much on the selection of the vibration sensitivity standard, on the lower bound of the stiffnesses used in the constrained optimization procedure, and on vibration environments. In all cases, however, the optimal seat damping obtained here is significantly larger (a factor of 2 to 10) than that obtained using existing seat suspension design methods or from previous optimal suspension studies. This research also indicates that the existing means of assessing vibration in suspension design (ISO 7096) requires modification. For the nonlinear seat suspension, results show that different vibration environments alter the optimal values of all seat parameters, especially the optimal nonlinear damping value; different initial conditions have significant effects on the optimal values of the nonlinear part of the damping; and different human properties have little effect on the optimal values of all seat parameters. In all nonlinear seat suspension cases, the optimal values of the objective function are much smaller than those of the <b>linear</b> seat <b>suspension.</b> The analysis shows that the optimal nonlinear seat suspension is much better than the optimal <b>linear</b> seat <b>suspension</b> and can be realized using a mechanism consisting of linear springs and dampers...|$|R

Project RISTRA is a collaboration by research institutions which will study teleseismic data recorded by a linear array of seismic stations spanning the west Texas Great Plains, the middle Rio Grande Rift and the southern Colorado Plateau. Seismic background noise levels at each station is characterized by taking the mean of multiple power spectral densities (PSDs) of representative samples of the total SBN at a station over time. The stations’ average PSD of the ambient noise is compared to the mean PSD of the seismic noise observed across the entire array, allowing inferences to be made regarding relative noise levels at RISTRA stations. Results show {{a high degree of}} variability in noise levels across the transect. This is due probably to the variability in site conditions. Relatively high noise levels in the 1. 0 - 10 Hz range are observed at all of the Great Plains sites as well as the Rio Grande Rift stations. Little variability is seen in the SBN across the array in the microseismic frequency range of 0. 07 to 0. 2 Hz. Overall, long-period (0. 003 - 0. 03 Hz) noise is greater on the two horizontal components than on the vertical components, although there is greater variability in long-period noise on the vertical-component.

The load model addresses spatial distribution of the load (e.g., concentrated load, distributed load, multiple load, etc.), speed of the load (e.g., constant speed, varying speed, etc.), trajectory of the load (e.g., straight line, curve, etc.), and magnitude of the load (e.g., constant load, impact load, sinusoidal load, varying load, and random load). The vehicle model addresses vehicle suspension system, which involves mass distribution, dimension, and configuration of the vehicle. Quarter-vehicle model, half-vehicle model, and whole vehicle model have all been established with increasing complexity involving different number of spring and dashpot elements. Regardless of how many spring and dashpot elements are {{being used in the}} built vehicle model, almost all the literature studies tend to use <b>linear</b> <b>suspension</b> system due to its ease of computation when integrated with a pavement model. The pavement model addresses the simplification of structural system of pavement using beam model, slab model, and layered medium on a half space or bedrock. In terms of constitutive models of the material, almost all studies only considered linear elastic and linear viscoelastic materials when tackling dynamics of vehicle–pavement interaction because of the complexity of the problem. Asphalt concrete pavement actually exhibits complex viscoelastic–viscoplastic-damage properties [166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172], which should be integrated into the subject. Also, it is rare to consider the coupling effect of vehicle–pavement interaction, while {{this is not the case}} in train–railway interaction because of the mechanism of the interaction and the relative mass difference between vehicles (e.g., car, truck, train, and airplane) and transportation infrastructure (e.g., highway, bridge, and railway).

The soft suspension CMWA can effectively reduce the force on the bearing (also disturbance forces produced by the CMWA) at high rotational speed, and also reduce the nonlinear characteristic of the stiffness. However, the instability of the soft suspension CMWA will limit the maximum rotational speed of the CMWA. Thus, a "proper" stiffness of the soft suspension system is a trade-off strategy between reduction of the force and extension of the speed range simultaneously...|$|R

The cross-linking PEG-PCL-based stent was able to transient from a <b>temporary</b> <b>linear</b> form to a permanent spiral shape with the transition temperature close to the body temperature. The combination of drugs including mitomycin C as an anti-proliferative drug, and curcumin as an anticoagulant agent {{in collaboration with the}} shape memory polymer could successfully serve as an effective device to treat the coronary artery disease. This biodegradable stent maintained its integrity with a 47 % weight loss after 2  months keeping in the simulated body condition proving not being collapsed into parts during bulk degradation. In another report by Chen et al. (2007), a biodegradable stent with the shape-memory property was developed. This stent was made of a blended chitosan (Ch) film cross-linked with an epoxy compound. To evaluate the efficacy of the prepared stent a commercially available metallic stent was used as a control. The results indicated the supremacy of polymeric stent in comparison to the metallic stent in respect to the elastic deformation. The metallic stent could tolerate elastic deformations of 10 % before deformation; however, the polymeric stent could tolerate deformations up to 30 % and after that it recovered the permanent configuration. The shape transition from a crimped (temporary shape) to a fully expanded state (permanent shape) took about 15  s which was advantageous to the system to avoid any migration from the location. Venkatraman et al. (2006) reported of a self-expandable stent with the feature of expanding at the body temperature. This bilayered biodegradable stent was composed of PLLA and PDLGA. In this study (Chen et al. 2007), the research team made use of glycerol and PEG (or PEO) to blend with Ch in order to improve the mechanical strength of Ch. More importantly, to achieve the shape-memory property, blended Ch was cross-linked with ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether as an epoxy compound in an aqueous environment. The bright side of this study is the reversible shape-switching process through hydration or water desorption. The fundamental drawback of this study is the long duration of full expansion of the stent after deployment. The minimum time of full expansion of the stent was 8  min which increased the possibility of stent migration during deployment. To avoid this problem, the stent expansion after the insertion should be fast.|$|R

The analysis is based on the system potential energy framework. Firstly, an arrangement of springs for gravity compensation in a four-bar linkage mechanism is proposed. It is then shown that for a four-bar linkage with symmetric geometric and mass properties the potential energy of the system has interesting and useful characteristics near the configuration at which the middle link is horizontal: an ideal operating configuration. The study also covers more practical cases where there is asymmetry in the mass distribution. The potential use of the mechanism in these cases is validated through a study of the sensitivity of the system potential energy function around the equilibrium point. Finally, based on the results obtained a novel mechanism is proposed for achieving gravity compensated vertical plane motion of a load mass. The proposed mechanism can have a wide range of travel and has significant potential for use not only in low-speed mechanical systems but also in high-speed heavy automated systems, where operating accelerations are of the order of 1 g or less.
