5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Stark</b> army {{arrives at}} the Twins, a {{fortified}} bridge stronghold controlled by the cranky Lord Walder Frey, who is nominally sworn to Catelyn's father Hoster Tully. However, Lord Frey has sealed off the bridge and refuses to let the army cross, so Catelyn negotiates on her son Robb's behalf. After some hard bargaining, Frey agrees to allow <b>the</b> <b>Stark</b> army to cross through The Twins and to commit some of his troops to the conflict with the Lannisters, but, in return, he wants Robb and his sister Arya to marry two of his children, to which Robb reluctantly agrees.|$|E
5|$|Upon their return, the Starks find a dead stag, sigil (seal) of House Baratheon. A bit farther {{they find}} a dead dire wolf and her {{surviving}} pups. Noting that the dire wolf is the sigil of <b>the</b> <b>Stark</b> family and {{there are as many}} pups as <b>the</b> <b>Stark</b> children (even an albino runt for Jon), they take the pups in as companions.|$|E
5|$|Crippled Bran Stark has Osha {{carry him}} into <b>the</b> <b>Stark</b> family crypt beneath Winterfell. There, they {{encounter}} the youngest Stark brother, Rickon, and his direwolf Shaggydog.

50|$|It {{was owned}} by <b>the</b> <b>Starks</b> family until <b>the</b> mid-1980s when it was sold to an {{investment}} group, which resold the building in 1997 to Empire State Collateral. Empire State defaulted on the mortgage and ownership {{was taken over by}} Allstate in 2004. The building was sold again in 2006 to the Hertz Investment Group. <b>The</b> <b>Starks</b> Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. It is connected by a skyway to Fourth Street Live!, an entertainment mall adjacent on the North side. On July 2, 2007, the Cordish Company, developers of Fourth Street Live!, announced that it would expand the mall southward by leasing the first floor (street-level) of <b>the</b> <b>Starks</b> Building. <b>The</b> Baltimore-based developer has since abandoned plans to develop 20000 sq ft of vacant street-level space in <b>the</b> <b>Starks</b> Building.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{purchase}} in 2006, occupancy {{has risen to}} 71 percent, as of May 2010, Hertz Investment Group said. <b>The</b> <b>Starks</b> building signed {{a number of new}} tenants during 2009, including an 11500 sq ft Eddie Merlot's restaurant, part of a Fort Wayne, Ind.-based upscale steakhouse chain.

5|$|Ramsay {{retreats to}} Winterfell, {{followed}} by Jon, Wun Wun and Tormund. Wun Wun breaks down Winterfell's gates and <b>the</b> <b>Stark</b> loyalists overwhelm {{the remnants of}} the Bolton garrison. A mortally wounded Wun Wun is finished off by Ramsay, who tells Jon that he has reconsidered the offer of single combat. Jon blocks Ramsay's arrows with a shield, overpowers and attempts to beat Ramsay to death, stopping when he sees Sansa and ordering him imprisoned, leaving Winterfell once more in the hands of House Stark. Bolton banners are shown falling off the walls and battlements of Winterfell to be replaced by <b>the</b> <b>Stark</b> direwolf. Sansa visits Ramsay after he is placed in the kennels with his hounds and despite Ramsay's insistence that his hounds will not turn on him, they devour him face-first as Sansa walks away, smiling.|$|E
5|$|The armies gather outside Winterfell {{the next}} morning. Ramsay brings Rickon out and has him run to Jon while firing arrows at him. Jon rushes to {{intercept}} Rickon {{but just before}} escaping, Rickon is killed by an arrow. Jon charges at Ramsay, who orders the Bolton archers to fire and his cavalry to charge; Davos orders <b>the</b> <b>Stark</b> force to shield Jon. The battle leaves hundreds of Bolton and Stark soldiers dead from hand-to-hand combat and from Bolton arrows, creating a wall of corpses. The Bolton infantry forms a circle around <b>the</b> <b>Stark</b> forces. Although the giant Wun Wun kills some Bolton soldiers, Tormund panics and sends the Wildlings towards the wall of bodies and Smalljon's forces, who easily cut them down. Jon is trampled by the Wildlings but struggles to his feet. <b>The</b> <b>Stark</b> forces appear doomed when a horn sounds in the distance as Petyr Baelish and Sansa arrive with the Knights of the Vale, who smash the Bolton army; Tormund kills Smalljon in the chaos.|$|E
5|$|The {{interiors}} {{of the episode}} were filmed at the Paint Hall studios, close to Belfast.

As Arya runs outside looking for her sword, a stable boy tries to detain her for the Queen, but she fatally stabs him before fleeing the castle.|$|E
5|$|ILM created 527 {{shots for}} the film, using {{programs}} such as Maya. Perception worked on over 125 shots for the film.

5|$|British Railways {{undertook}} a massive programme to establish itself by repainting all its locomotives {{with their new}} BR numbers and replacing their previous corporate identity with its own. Gone were the tenders proclaiming the railway companies' logos, emblems and even coats of arms, {{to be replaced by}} <b>the</b> <b>stark</b> 'BRITISH RAILWAYS' lettering. The enormity of this task meant that the necessary repainting was not necessarily carried out to coincide with an overall repaint. For the Coronation Class, all locomotives had been through this process by the end of 1948 except for Nos. 6223, 6238, 6248, 6250, and 6252–6255, a total of 29 locomotives.

5|$|Close {{examination}} of the spectral lines reveals that some display a fine structure splitting. This occurs because of spin–orbit coupling, which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron. When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the Zeeman effect. This {{is caused by the}} interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple electron configurations with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines. The presence of an external electric field can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called <b>the</b> <b>Stark</b> effect.|$|E
5|$|Ida {{insisted that}} McKinley {{continue}} his increasingly successful career {{in law and}} politics. He attended the state Republican convention that nominated Hayes for a third term as governor in 1875, and campaigned again for his old friend in the election that fall. The next year, McKinley undertook a high-profile case defending a group of coal miners arrested for rioting after a clash with strikebreakers. Lynch, McKinley's opponent in the 1871 election, and his partner, William R. Day, were the opposing counsel, and the mine owners included Mark Hanna, a Cleveland businessman. Taking the case pro bono, he was successful in getting {{all but one of}} the miners acquitted. The case raised McKinley's standing among laborers, a crucial part of <b>the</b> <b>Stark</b> County electorate, and also introduced him to Hanna, who would become his strongest backer in years to come.|$|E
5|$|In 1888 Dekum, Richard L. Durham, and John B.
