During a press conference on 27 October, it was announced that Määttä would undergo surgery to remove a tumor from his neck <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> low-grade thyroid cancer. On 4 November, he underwent successful surgery and was expected to make a full recovery, and on 18 November, just two weeks after his surgery, it was announced that he would be returning to the Penguins lineup to play that night against the Montreal Canadiens. On 6 December, Määttä re-injured the same shoulder he had surgery on during the off-season—he would go on to miss 16 games before the Penguins would announce, on 13 January 2015, that he would miss the remainder of the season to have another surgery to repair the shoulder. During this time he was also diagnosed with the mumps.|$|E
25|$|The {{area around}} Hudson River was {{inhabited}} by indigenous peoples ages before Europeans arrived. The Lenape, Wappinger, and Mahican {{branches of the}} Algonquins lived along the river, mostly in peace with the other groups. The Algonquins in the region mainly lived in small clans and villages throughout the area. One major settlement was called Navish, which was located at Croton Point, overlooking the Hudson River. Other settlements were located in various locations throughout the Hudson Highlands. Many villagers lived in various types of houses, which the Algonquins called wigwams, though large families often lived in longhouses <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> hundred feet long. At the associated villages, they grew corn, beans, and squash. They also gathered other types of plant foods, such as hickory nuts and many other wild fruits and tubers. In addition to agriculture, the Algonquins also fished in the Hudson River, focusing on various species of freshwater fish, as well as various variations of striped bass, American eels, sturgeon, herring, and shad. Oyster beds were also common on the river floor, which provided an extra source of nutrition. Land hunting consisted of turkey, deer, bear, and other animals.|$|E

The {{inscription}} surrounding {{the base of}} the dome (Tu es Petrus et super hanc petram edificabo ecclesiam meam et portae inferi non praevale buntadversus eam: You are Peter (rock) and on that rock I shall build my church and gates of hell shall not prevail against it) is from the Confession of Peter and is {{the same as that of}} St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. Above it, there are sculptures of four Doctors of the Church: Saint Jerome, Saint Augustine (his sculpture can be seen from the entrance), Saint Ambrose, and Pope Gregory I. Still above them there are scores of angels. The composition culminates with God the Father in the center of the dome as if to say that God sees everything. This composition seems inverted since the Evangelists are below the Doctors, but <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> purposeful statement to emphasize importance of the Church after the Council of Trent. A boat-shaped chandelier made of brass and glass beads hangs from the middle of the dome and reminds that Saint Peter was a fisherman. Made by craftsmen from Liepāja and installed in 1905, it had eight seven-branch candle holders.|$|E
25|$|In {{considering}} post-detection {{courses of}} action, {{it is also}} useful to consider the relative technological capabilities both in relation to signal relay time and in relation {{to whether or not}} the ETI is thought to pose a militaristic threat. If the ETI in question is transmitting from outside the Solar System, there will be a significant lag in time between transmission and receipt by either party. The relative sophistication of the communication technology available to each party would play heavily into the feasibility of certain types and content of messaging. In a similar vein, the potential disparities in sophistication of weapons technology hold grave implications for how humankind should react to ETI. Due to the perceived risk of revealing the precise location of the Earth to alien civilizations, METI has been heavily criticized as irresponsible considering the lack of information available about any real or potential ETI threat. Even in the likely scenario that accurate locational coordinates of Earth were available, there is question as to whether humankind should reveal anything more about itself <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> boon to hostile ETI. Notable among the critics of METI are British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking and science fiction author David Brin.|$|E
25|$|Identification of {{the exact}} causes usually begins with a {{thorough}} medical history, including detailed questioning about symptoms, bowel habits, diet, medication and other medical problems. Digital rectal examination is performed to assesses resting pressure and voluntary contraction (maximum squeeze) of the sphincter complex and puborectalis. Anal sphincter defects, rectal prolapse, and abnormal perineal descent may be detected. Anorectal physiology tests assess {{the functioning of the}} anorectal anatomy. Anorectal manometry records the pressure exerted by the anal sphincters and puborectalis during rest and during contraction. The procedure is also able to assess sensitivity of the anal canal and rectum. Anal electromyography tests for nerve damage, which is often associated with obstetric injury. Pudendal nerve terminal motor latency tests for damage to the pudendal motor nerves. Proctography, also known as defecography, shows how much stool the rectum can hold, how well the rectum holds it, and how well the rectum can evacuate the stool. It will also highlight defects {{in the structure of the}} rectum such as internal rectal intussusception. Dynamic pelvic MRI, also called MRI defecography is an alternative which is better for some problems but not as good for other problems. Proctosigmoidoscopy involves the insertion of an endoscope (a long, thin, flexible tube with a camera) into the anal canal, rectum and sigmoid colon. The procedure allows for visualization of the interior of the gut, and may detect signs of disease or other problems <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> cause, such as inflammation, tumors, or scar tissue. Endoanal ultrasound, which some consider to be the gold standard for detection of anal canal lesions, evaluates the structure of the anal sphincters, and may detect occult sphincter tears that otherwise would go unseen.|$|E

Brosnan was seen by many as the quintessential James Bond in appearance and manner; displaying an air of coolness, elegance and a grace which made him believable as an international playboy, if not purely as an assassin. John G. Stackhouse for instance argues that it is preposterous that any man as strikingly handsome as Brosnan and Connery could be a secret agent, saying, [...] "When Sean Connery or Pierce Brosnan enters a room, everyone notices.

However, Fowler felt {{there was a lack of}} closure over Tom's resentment in the episode of Ron dating Wendy. Joel Keller of TV Squad felt the new Chris and Ben characters served as a strong springboard into the third season, and that the premiere episode lived up to the anticipation caused by the show's long hiatus. However, Keller said Tom's continued pining for Wendy felt [...] "a little protracted at this point". New York magazine writer Steve Kandell praised the episode and said the parks department employees taking drastic steps to save their department reflected Parks efforts to seek out higher ratings. Kandell, however, felt introducing Chris' tragic back story in the episode felt rushed. Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic called the episode consistently funny, and said the new characters Ben and Chris were starting to hit their stride. However, Hochberger said Eduardo subplot felt like a contrived device to continue keeping April and Andy apart. Not all reviews were entirely positive. David Hinckley of New York Daily News called Parks and Recreation [...] "a good show <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> better show", claiming it falls short of other NBC comedies like 30 Rock. Hinckley cited the basketball game with Andy, Ron and Tom as a scene that feels too much like a sketch comedy bit rather than a natural progression of the script. Nick Purdy of Paste said the addition of new cast members Chris and Ben may have diluted the rest of the cast's talents, and that the episode felt as if it had [...] "too many plates spinning", leaving not enough screentime for strong characters like April Ludgate and Ron Swanson.|$|E
