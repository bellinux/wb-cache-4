50|$|<b>Trafermin</b> (brand name Fiblast), {{also known}} as {{recombinant}} human {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} (rhbFGF), is a recombinant form of human basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) which is marketed in Japan as a topical spray for the treatment of skin ulcers. It is also currently in preregistration for the treatment of periodontitis. As a recombinant form of bFGF, <b>trafermin</b> is a potent agonist of the FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4. The drug has been marketed in Japan since June 2001.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Trafermin</b> (basic {{fibroblast}} growth factor) {{has been}} shown to reduce infarct volume in acute ischemic stroke models, and to promote functional recovery and new synapse formation when given to animals with completed cerebral infarction. A previous study in acute stroke patients suggested that <b>trafermin</b> was safe and well tolerated when given over a 3 -hour period over a wide dose range. METHODS AND RESULTS: Double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled trial of a single 24 -hour intravenous infusion of <b>trafermin.</b> Patients having onset of stroke symptoms within 6 h and a baseline score of >/= 7 on the NIH Stroke Scale (>/= 2 motor) were randomized to receive 5 or 10 mg of <b>trafermin</b> or placebo intravenously infused over 24 h. The primary efficacy outcome was a categorized combination of the Barthel and Rankin scales assessed at 90 days. A total of 286 patients had been enrolled at 55 sites in 11 countries when the sponsor directed that enrollment be stopped because an interim analysis of efficacy data predicted too small a chance of demonstrating a statistically significant benefit after recruitment of the planned 900 patients. The 5 -mg group showed a slight but nonsignificant advantage over placebo (OR 1. 2, 95 % CI 0. 72 - 2. 00, p = 0. 48); the 10 -mg group showed a nonsignificant disadvantage (OR 0. 74, 95 % CI 0. 44 - 1. 22, p = 0. 24). Mortality rates at 90 days were 17 % in the 5 -mg group, 24 % in the 10 -mg group and 18 % in the placebo group. Treatment with <b>trafermin</b> was associated with an increased leukocytosis and a decrease in blood pressure: mean decrease in systolic blood pressure from baseline was 19 mm Hg in the 5 -mg group, 22 mm Hg in the 10 -mg group and 8 mm Hg in the placebo group. In a post hoc subgroup analysis, patients in the 5 -mg group treated more than 5 h after the onset of symptoms showed an apparent advantage over placebo (OR 2. 1, 95 % CI 1. 00 - 4. 41, p = 0. 044; after age adjustment: OR 1. 9, 95 % CI 0. 91 - 4. 13, p = 0. 08). CONCLUSIONS: With the proper treatment regimen, <b>trafermin</b> can likely be given safely to stroke patients. The 5 -mg dose showed a trend toward a treatment advantage. The ideal time window for this agent may exceed 5 h. This may open new avenues for acute stroke therapy, aiming at enhancing recovery mechanisms rather than immediate neuroprotection...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{potential}} {{applications of}} {{human embryonic stem}} cells (hESCs) in regenerative medicine and developmental research have made stem cell biology {{one of the most}} fascinating and rapidly expanding fields of biomedicine. The first clinical trial of hESCs in humans has begun, and the field of stem cell therapy has just entered a new era. Here, we report seven hESC lines (SEES- 1, - 2, - 3, - 4, - 5, - 6, and - 7). Four of them were derived and maintained on irradiated human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) grown in xenogeneic-free defined media and substrate. Xenogeneic-free hMSCs isolated from the subcutaneous tissue of extra fingers from individuals with polydactyly showed appropriate potentials as feeder layers in the pluripotency and growth of hESCs. In this report, we describe a comprehensive characterization of these newly derived SEES cell lines. In addition, we developed a scalable culture system for hESCs having high biological safety by using gamma-irradiated serum replacement and pharmaceutical-grade recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, also known as <b>trafermin).</b> This is first report describing the maintenance of hESC pluripotency using pharmaceutical-grade human recombinant bFGF (<b>trafermin)</b> and gamma-irradiated serum replacement. Our defined medium system provides a path to scalability in Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) settings for the generation of clinically relevant cell types from pluripotent cells for therapeutic applications...|$|E
