50|$|The first {{production}} unit of Hindustan Cables {{was set up}} in 1952 in Rupnarayanpur, in technical collaboration with Standard Telephones and Cables Ltd.for production of paper insulated dry core cables. In 2007 updated and expanded Rupnarainpur unit, with an installed capacity of 63 LCKM, manufactures polythene insulated jelly filled cables and aerial cables. Facilities for manufacturing 1 million pairs of <b>telephone</b> <b>coiled</b> cords and 1.5 million pieces of computer cords have been set up in the unit. The telephone cords (2 way ovular straight and 4 way ovular extensible etc.) conform to latest specification and cater to Indian market and the computer cords for Computer Industries. This company used to make profits up to 1993-94. Since 1995, it has been incurring losses. Tata Consultancy Study Report has clearly stated that revival of HCL is viable provided HCL is diversified into new products. The cost of revival, as per their recommendation, would be Rs.281.22 crore whereas the cost of closure would be Rs.1,766.61 crore. Bihar Pottery has refractory unit at Rupnarayanpur but the refractory industry in the region is facing an uncertain future. Unfortunately, since last couple of year production of sick HCL is totally stopped.|$|R
50|$|Telephone systems {{also use}} matched {{impedances}} to minimise echo on long-distance lines. This {{is related to}} transmission-line theory. Matching also enables the <b>telephone</b> hybrid <b>coil</b> (2- to 4-wire conversion) to operate correctly. As the signals are sent and received on the same two-wire circuit to the central office (or exchange), cancellation is necessary at the telephone earpiece so excessive sidetone is not heard. All devices used in telephone signal paths are generally dependent on matched cable, source and load impedances. In the local loop, the impedance chosen is 600 ohms (nominal). Terminating networks are installed at the exchange to offer the best match to their subscriber lines. Each country has its own standard for these networks, but they are all designed to approximate about 600 ohms over the voice frequency band.|$|R
5000|$|... 1951 saw the {{creation}} of a 25-watt radial moving-coil loudspeaker, for that year's Agricultural Exhibition in Moscow. From around 1954, the plant began to modernise and focus exclusively on telephone and microphone production. In 1957, Oktava small <b>telephones</b> and moving <b>coil</b> radial loudspeakers were displayed in the Russian section at the 1958 exhibition in Brussels. In 1961 Oktava introduced the D2 miniature telephone and began supplying dynamic microphones to the Kremlin. The plant also commenced a second round of modernisation and began producing electro-acoustic measuring instruments to test microphones and telephones.|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of a weak (1 microTesla) complex magnetic field pat-tern with a relevant electrophysiological signature produced an analge-sic response in rats to thermal stimuli when the pattern was presented once every 4 sec for 30 min through iron-core solenoids. In one experi-ment, the burst-firing pattern was presented once every 4 s for 30 min and restricted to the positive polarity, negative polarity or a bipolar equivalent. The strongest analgesia occurred when the burst-firing pat-tern was presented with positive polarity or as the typical bipolar sig-nal. Administrations of the burst-firing pattern once per week for four consecutive weeks produced analgesia that was clearly evident during the first, third, and fourth weeks but not during {{the second week of}} treatment. A <b>telephone</b> sensor <b>coil</b> (that can be readily obtained from local electronic shops) was then used instead of the solenoids along with an audio (. wav) file to generate the magnetic field; the analgesia was still apparent. However, when the magnetic pattern was generate...|$|R
5000|$|At {{least one}} company, Audiovox, built {{and may have}} offered an {{electric}} solid-body as early as 1932. Audiovox electric guitars were built by Paul Tutmarc who is also credited as the co-inventor of the magnetic pickup along with Art Stimpson, and the fretted electric bass guitar. Bob Wisner worked for Paul converting tube radio amplifiers into guitar amplifiers and eventually developing his own amplifier circuits so Paul's instruments could be sold along with their own amplifiers. Paul was unsuccessful at obtaining a patent for his magnetic pickup as it was too similar to the <b>telephone</b> microphone <b>coil</b> sensor device. Audiovox production was handed over to Paul's son, Bud Tutmarc, who continued building these instruments under the brand, [...] "Bud-Electro" [...] until the early 1950s. Bud Tutmarc had been delegated by the senior Tutmarc the task of winding the pickup coils used on his father's and he continued producing them for his own guitars. He used horseshoe magnets in a single-coil and later a hum cancelling dual coil configuration. Bob Wisner was hired by Rickenbacher, later spelled Rickenbacker and may have passed on Tutmarc's magnetic pickup technology and helped them develop the more familiar bar magnet and pole-piece pickup construction still widely used today for their cast aluminum electric guitar, nicknamed The Frying Pan or The Pancake Guitar, beginning in 1933.|$|R

[...] At first amplifiers were not available and when they did become available they were expensive.
