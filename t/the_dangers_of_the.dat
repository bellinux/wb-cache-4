5|$|Robert Louis Stevenson's {{connection}} {{with the construction of}} Dubh Artach and its shore station played a significant part in his 1886 novel Kidnapped during which the main character, David Balfour, experiences <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Torran Rocks and is marooned on Erraid.|$|E
5|$|After filming, {{parts of}} the {{interior}} sets of the So'na ships were added using CGI. Stage 15 on the Paramount lot {{was used for the}} climactic scene between Picard and Ru'afo. Because of <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four-story scaffolding-like set, the actors were attached by safety cables at all times. Paramount's B tankwhich was used to represent San Francisco Bay in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Homewas used to shoot footage of Picard, Data and Anij at the Ba'ku lake. For a scene in which Data walks along a lake-bed, the actor's tricorder prop was covered with plastic to make it watertight.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1857, {{the need for}} a {{lighthouse}} on Point Stephens was identified, due to the proximity to the entrance of Port Stephens, and <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local coastline to ships. Another reason was that mariners were mistaking the entrance to Fingal Bay for that of Port Stephens. At least twenty four vessels are known to have been wrecked in the area. the most serious being the Dove in 1828 with the loss of seven lives, and the Pandora in 1836 with five lives. Another notable wreck was the Florence Irving in 1877.|$|E

The attempts lead him {{to the roof of}} the building, where he tries to show that depression caused by an office can lead to desperate circumstances. Meanwhile, gambling between the other employees of the office leads Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones) to discover that she is still an outsider.|$|E
5|$|Chandrasekaran, Gnanasekaran and Gunasekaran {{are three}} Indian {{immigrant}} brothers from Madurai, Tamil Nadu living in Rangoon, Burma with Chandrasekaran's wife Saraswati. Their younger sister Kalyani {{was raised in}} their home town by their father Manickampillai. In 1942, during World War II, the three brothers and Saraswati plan to visit Madurai to attend the impending wedding of Kalyani to a writer named Thangappan. Due to war conditions and bombardment of Burmese ports by Japan, the shipping company offers only one ticket and Gunasekaran, the youngest brother, takes it and leaves for Tamil Nadu. The ship fails to reach on time due to <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, and Kalyani's marriage takes place without any of her brothers present.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder {{attends a}} parole hearing for Monte Propps, {{a serial killer}} he helped to {{apprehend}} in the late 1980s. Propps' method of killing involved brainwashing his kidnapped victims until {{they were willing to}} commit suicide by drowning; however he is now seen as a model reformee and is released. Shortly afterwards, Mulder meets with Frank Black, who warns him of <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> offender's freedom. The two visit the released man's halfway house, arriving shortly after his parole officer; inside they find Propps drowned in his bath. In an alley outside, they parole officer is also found dead, with the ouroboros symbol of the Millennium Group tattooed on her neck. A child in the alley momentarily speaks to Black with the voice of a demonic entity he recognises, warning of impending disaster.|$|E

5|$|Lusa is a pampered {{black bear}} {{living in the}} Bear Bowl, a zoo in Canada. Despite knowing that the {{wilderness}} is harsh, Lusa has dreams about one day escaping and living outside. Her father, King, once lived in the wild and is strongly against Lusa's idea. One day, Toklo's mom is brought into the Bear Bowl. She talks with Lusa about how much she regretted abandoning her cubs, {{but that it was}} too late and that she couldn't find them. Hearing this, Lusa decides to bring a message to Toklo about how sorry his mother is. Although Lusa succeeds in escaping, she realizes <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wild. At the end of the story, Ujurak and Toklo meet up with Lusa.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the entire}} party, none were skilled skiers and only Bernacchi and Armitage had any {{experience}} with dog-sledges. The {{results of the}} men's early efforts to master these techniques were not encouraging, and tended to reinforce Scott's preference for man-hauling. <b>The</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unfamiliar conditions were confirmed when, on 11 March, a party returning from an attempted journey to Cape Crozier became stranded on an icy slope during a blizzard. In their attempts to find safer ground, one of the group, Able Seaman George Vince, slid {{over the edge of}} a cliff and was killed. His body was never recovered; a cross with a simple inscription, erected in his memory, still stands at the summit of the Hut Point promontory.|$|E
5|$|On 13 June 1944 the V-1 {{flying bomb}} {{offensive}} began and Cunningham was tasked with assisting with their interception. He also coordinated his efforts with No. 100 Group RAF, which {{were engaged in}} intruder operations over occupied Europe. Cunningham was concerned at using Mosquitoes for intercepting V-1s because of <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bomb exploding and damaging the attacking fighter. One of his former commanding officers and current Group Captain Edward Crew—an ace with 15 enemy aircraft and 31 V-1s shot down—was forced to bail out when the nose of his Mosquito was split open. The operations did last long and by August 1944 the Mosquitoes were back on bomber support missions.|$|E

5|$|Fellow street artist Shepard Fairey {{wrote in}} Swindle:Invader's pop art may seem shallow, but by taking <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> {{illegally}} re-contextualizing video game characters {{in an urban}} environment that provides more chaotic social interaction than a gamer's bedroom, he makes a statement about <b>the</b> desensitizing nature <b>of</b> video games and consumer culture. In a postmodern paradox, a game like Grand Theft Auto takes <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> streets {{and puts it in}} a safe video game, while Invader takes a safe video game icon and inserts it into <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> streets.|$|R
5|$|During {{the first}} half of the century several castles were maintained, or brought back into {{military}} use. During the Irish War of Independence Dublin Castle remained the centre of the British administration, military and intelligence operations in Ireland until the transfer of power and the castle to the Irish Free State in 1922. During the Second World War the Tower of London was used to hold and execute suspected spies, and was used to briefly detain Rudolf Hess, Adolf Hitler's deputy, in 1941. Edinburgh Castle was used as a prisoner of war facility, while Windsor Castle was stripped of more delicate royal treasures and used to guard the British royal family from <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Blitz. Some coastal castles were used to support naval operations: Dover Castle's medieval fortifications used as basis for defences across the Dover Strait; Pitreavie Castle in Scotland was used to support the Royal Navy; and Carrickfergus Castle in Ireland was used as a coastal defence base. Some castles, such as Cambridge and Pevensey, were brought into local defence plans in case of a German invasion. A handful of these castles retained a military role after the war; Dover was used as a nuclear war command centre into the 1950s, while Pitreavie was used by NATO until the turn of the 21st century.|$|E

25|$|One famous Nixe {{of recent}} German folklore, {{deriving}} from 19th-century literature, was Lorelei; {{according to the}} legend, {{she sat on the}} rock at the Rhine which now bears her name, and lured fishermen and boatmen to <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reefs with the sound of her voice.

25|$|Psychicisation is a turn inward, so {{that one}} realises the psychic being, the psychic {{personality}} or Divine Soul, {{in the core of}} one's being.
