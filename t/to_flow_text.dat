40|$|The maxmin fair {{bandwidth}} allocation {{has been}} proposed as a flow/congestion control mechanism for managing the best-effort data traffic in connection-oriented networks. It achieves the fairness by assigning an equal share of bandwidth <b>to</b> each <b>flow</b> passing a link whenever possible; it improves the system throughput by fully utilizing the link capacity whenever possible. This type of fairness- and throughput-aware bandwidth allocation and corresponding routing schemes are important in multimedia connection-oriented networks for a class of services, such as ABR in ATM networks, which will carry heterogeneous types of best-effort traffic from non-real-time multimedia <b>to</b> ASCII <b>text</b> <b>flows.</b> We present two contributions in this paper.

Using theories put forth by Roger Wallis and Krister Malm (1984) and Shujen Wang and Jonathan Zhu (2003), the goal of my research is to identify major technological, economic, and organizational shifts taking place within the distribution and consumption of compact discs (CDs) in Ho Chi Minh City. This work suggests that Vietnam operates outside of our traditional understanding {{of the music industry}} or cultural flows. Unauthorized music products are helping to create a demand for all types of music in Vietnam and this begs us to question whether piracy is as negative for this country as previously thought. This thesis argues that the piracy in HCMC is a rare case of defiance and triumph over major global corporations. This study explores the magnitude of international copyright conventions, intellectual property rights enforcement, the structure of the domestic industry and the high profitability and affordability of piracy. Using a qualitative case studies approach, this examination looks at the different political, legal and regulatory frameworks that control the trajectories of music piracy in Ho Chi Minh City...|$|R

We propose Iustitia, a framework for identifying flow nature on the fly. The key observation behind Iustitia is that <b>text</b> <b>flows</b> have the lowest entropy and encrypted flows have the highest entropy, while the entropy of binary flows stands in between. We further extend Iustitia for the finer-grained classification of binary flows {{so that we can}} differentiate different types of binary flows (such as image, video, and executables) and even the file formats (such as JPEG and GIF for images, MPEG and AVI for videos) carried by binary flows. The basic idea of Iustitia is <b>to</b> classify <b>flows</b> using machine learning techniques where a feature is the entropy of every certain number of consecutive bytes. Our experimental results show that the classification can be done with high speed and high accuracy. On average, Iustitia can classify flows with 88. 27 % of accuracy using a buffer size of 1 K with a classification time of less than 10 % of packet inter-arrival time for 91. 2 % of flows.
