50|$|<b>The</b> {{institution}} of <b>protecting</b> power became customary {{in international law}} but was not formalized until the Geneva Convention of 1929.

The Netherlands, acting as <b>the</b> <b>protecting</b> power for <b>the</b> Boer Republics, was also unable to secure an agreement to exchange the names of prisoners of war. Just two years later during the Russo-Japanese War, the belligerents agreed to exchange lists of prisoners, communicating through France as <b>the</b> <b>protecting</b> power for Russia, and the United States as <b>the</b> <b>protecting</b> power for Japan.
