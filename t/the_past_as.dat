It was more commonly done in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>as</b> part of strategic diplomacy for national interest. Although sometimes enforced by legal requirement on persons of royal birth, more often {{it has been a}} matter of political policy and/or tradition in monarchies.|$|E

5|$|Following {{announcements}} {{that the}} band had begun composition of new material and booked studio time in early 2010 with Kevin Shirley producing, The Final Frontier was announced on 4 March. The album, the band's fifteenth, {{was released on}} 16 August, garnering critical acclaim and the band's greatest commercial success in their history, reaching No.1 in twenty-eight countries worldwide. Although Steve Harris had been quoted in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>as</b> claiming that the band would only produce fifteen studio releases, band members have since confirmed {{that there will be}} at least one further record.|$|E
5|$|In early 1969, Quaife {{told the}} band he was leaving. The other members {{did not take}} his {{statement}} seriously, until an article appeared in New Musical Express on 4 April featuring Quaife's new band, Maple Oak, which he had formed without telling {{the rest of the}} Kinks. Ray Davies pleaded with him to return for the sessions for their upcoming album, but Quaife refused. Davies immediately called up John Dalton, who had filled in for Quaife in <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>as</b> a replacement. Dalton remained with the group until 1977, when the album Sleepwalker was released.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} era, {{the park was}} long known chiefly for its {{isolated}} location and primitive camping facilities. In August 1952it played host to the first Woodsmen's Carnival, an annual celebration of the lumbering industry, which was again active in the second growth forests in the area. The festival, originally sponsored by the Penn-York Lumbermen's Club, features lumberjack competitions {{as a reminder of}} <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>as</b> well as displays of new equipment. In 1987the Galeton Rotary Club took over sponsorship, and renamed the event the Woodsmen's Show in 1990.|$|E

5|$|Measurements of {{the motion}} of intracluster {{planetary}} nebulae between M87 and M86 suggest that these two galaxies are moving toward each other {{and this may be}} their first encounter. M87 may have encountered M84 in <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>as</b> evidenced by the truncation of the outer halo of the former from tidal effects. However, another possible cause of this truncation is a contraction due to an unseen mass falling into M87 {{from the rest of the}} cluster, which, in particular, may be the hypothesized dark matter. A third possibility is that the halo formation was truncated as a result of early feedback from the active galactic nucleus at the core of M87.|$|E
5|$|Shells {{are used}} decoratively in many ways. They can be pressed into {{concrete}} or plaster to make decorative paths, steps or walls {{and can be}} used to embellish picture frames, mirrors or other craft items. They can be stacked up and glued together to make ornaments. They can be pierced and threaded onto necklaces or made into other forms of jewellery. Shells have had various uses in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>as</b> body decorations, utensils, scrapers and cutting implements. Carefully cut and shaped shell tools dating back 32,000 years have been found in a cave in Indonesia. In this region, shell technology may have been developed in preference to the use of stone or bone implements, perhaps because of the scarcity of suitable rock materials.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Liverpool Building was {{constructed}} using a reinforced concrete frame, {{which not only}} made the building structurally strong, but also much more fire resistant than buildings in <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> <b>As</b> {{a result of being}} built {{on the site of the}} former George’s Dock, the building required deeper foundations than normal and in total some 35,000 tons of cement were used. Due to the building’s proximity to the River Mersey, extensive work was carried out during the development of the basement level in order to make sure it was water resistant. Asphalt was used extensively to coat the floors and walls of the basement, in order to make sure it stayed dry.|$|E

Then the story returns to <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>as</b> Daniel and Newton return to London: Newton is under the {{patronage}} of Louis Anglesey, the Earl of Upnor, and Daniel becomes secretary of the Royal Society when Henry Oldenburg is detained by the King for his active foreign correspondence. During his stint in London, Daniel encounters {{a number of important}} actors from the period. Daniel remains one of the more prominent actors in the Royal Society, close to Royal Society members involved in court life and politics. By 1672 both Daniel and Newton become fellows at Trinity College where they build an extensive alchemical laboratory which attracts other significant alchemists including John Locke and Robert Boyle. Daniel convinces Newton to present his work on calculus to the Royal Society.|$|E
5|$|At {{one year}} of age, joint {{attention}} is displayed through a child's understanding of pointing as an intentional act. One-year-olds also establish joint attention for objects within their visual field before objects beyond their current visual field. At this age, infants are not yet able to represent their entire environment, only what they can see. At age 15 months, children recognize the minds of others. At this age, children also {{recognize the importance of}} eyes for seeing and that physical objects can block sight. At age 18 months, infants are capable of following an individual's gaze to outside their visual field and establishing (representative) joint attention. 18-month-olds also grasp the intentional, referential nature of looking, the mentalistic experience of seeing and the role of eyes and are skilled at following both gaze and pointing with precision. At two years of age, children display joint attention by extending attention beyond the present and understanding that the targets of other's attention extends to <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>as</b> well. Two-year-olds are also capable of representational thought or increased memory.|$|E
