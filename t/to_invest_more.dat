5|$|In January 1287, {{the embassy}} arrived at Beijing, and was {{received}} by the Yuan emperor. The Burmese delegation formally acknowledged Mongol suzerainty of their kingdom, and agreed to pay annual tribute tied to the agricultural output of the country. (Indeed, the tribute was no longer nominal.) In exchange, the emperor agreed to withdraw his troops. For the emperor, the Burma campaign was the only bright spot; his other Southeast Asian expeditions had gone badly. He did not want <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> <b>more</b> troops pacify {{the rest of the}} kingdom. He preferred a vassal ruler. The Burmese embassy arrived back at Hlegya in May 1287, and reported the terms to the king.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to calling for cuts in federal government spending {{to help reduce}} the national debt, Romney proposed measures intended to limit the growth of entitlement programs, such as introducing means testing and gradually raising the eligibility ages for receipt of Social Security and Medicare. He supported substantial increases in military spending and promised <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> <b>more</b> heavily in military weapons programs while {{increasing the number of}} active-duty military personnel. He was very supportive of the directions taken by the budget proposals of Paul Ryan, although he later proposed his own budget plan.|$|E
40|$|Firms have <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> {{in foreign}} markets to {{maintain}} their competitive advantage, but a popular location for foreign direct investment (FDI) may not be suitable for everyone. Available literature as to location choice is mainly based on developed countries and large multinational enterprises (MNEs). However, this study investigates the location choice behaviour of firms originating in newly industrialized economies (Taiwanese firms) investing in emerging countries (China and Vietnam). According to the national economic development of China (further divided into South China and East China) and Vietnam, we divide the location into more developed and less developed regions. Through an empirical firm-level data collection and conditional logit analysis, this study found that: (1) firms with stronger ownership advantages prefer <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in <b>more</b> developed than less developed regions; (2) firms occupying favourable positions in their network prefer <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in <b>more</b> developed than less developed regions; (3) firms {{with a high degree}} of networking prefer <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in less developed than more developed regions; (4) firms choose <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in <b>more</b> developed than less developed regions to gain access to a large market; and (5) firms with strong resource-seeking motives prefer <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in <b>more</b> developed than less developed regions to access their resources.

5|$|In April 2006, Ofotbanen {{declared}} {{that they were}} in severe financial difficulties. Accounts payable were giving liquidity problems, and Ofotbanen announced that they needed more capital, estimated at NOK 8 million. GB Group said they were not willing <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> <b>more</b> money in the railway company. Ofotbanen had then been losing money continually since the start-up in 2001; in 2004, it had a deficit of NOK 4 million of a NOK 20 million revenue. At the extraordinary general meeting on 4 September 2006, the company was sold for NOK 1 million to Rail Management, a holding company for the London-based shipping owner Mons Bolin. In November, the Norwegian Rail Inspectorate threatened to withdraw the company's safety license, since they had failed to show proper maintenance of the rolling stock.|$|E
5|$|In the 2001 {{parliamentary}} election the party lost the gains {{it had made}} according to opinion polling but maintained its position from the 1997 election, it got 14.6% and 26 members in the parliament. The election result allowed them to unseat the Labour Party government of Jens Stoltenberg {{and replace it with}} a three-party coalition led by Christian Democrat Kjell Magne Bondevik. However, the coalition continued to decline to govern together with the Progress Party as they considered the political differences too large. The Progress Party eventually decided to tolerate the coalition, as it promised <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> <b>more</b> in defence, open more private hospitals and open for more competition in the public sector. In 2002 the Progress Party again advanced in the opinion polls and for a while became the largest party.|$|E
5|$|As {{in many of}} his {{previous}} pursuits, Burnet set an ambitious agenda for himself but ran into difficulties. He saw the Academy as the peak lobby group {{of the scientific community}} and their main liaison with government and industry. He tried to lift its profile and use it to persuade the political and industrial leadership <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> <b>more</b> in science. He also wanted to use the Academy to increase the involvement of the eminent scientists of Australia in training and motivating the next generation, but these initiatives were not successful {{due to a lack of}} concrete method. Most controversially, he tried to change the membership criteria of the Academy. He wanted to stop the Royal Society from operating in Australia and accepting new Australian members. He reasoned that the Australian Academy would not be strong if the Royal Society would be able to compete with it, and he felt that if Australian scientists were allowed to possess membership of the both bodies, the more established Royal Society would make the Australian Academy look poor in comparison. Questions were raised over the existing dual members—such as Burnet—being able to maintain their status and the hypocrisy thereby entailed in Burnet's nationalistic proposal, and it was defeated heavily.|$|E

25|$|Several mid-level {{evolutionary}} theories inform evolutionary psychology. The r/K selection theory {{proposes that}} some species prosper by having many offspring, while others follow {{the strategy of}} having fewer offspring but investing much more in each one. Humans follow the second strategy. Parental investment theory explains how parents invest {{more or less in}} individual offspring based on how successful those offspring are likely to be, and thus how much they might improve the parents' inclusive fitness. According to the Trivers-Willard hypothesis, parents in good conditions tend <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> <b>more</b> in sons (who are best {{able to take advantage of}} good conditions), while parents in poor conditions tend <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> <b>more</b> in daughters (who are best able to have successful offspring even in poor conditions). According to life history theory, animals evolve life histories to match their environments, determining details such as age at first reproduction and number of offspring. Dual inheritance theory posits that genes and human culture have interacted, with genes affecting the development of culture, and culture, in turn, affecting human evolution on a genetic level (see also the Baldwin effect).|$|E
