50|$|<b>Chain</b> <b>printing</b> {{allowed a}} single set of {{characters}} to pass horizontally {{across the front}} of paper at high speed, with a ribbon the full width of the paper passing vertically in between the chain and the front of the paper. Instead of pressing the characters toward the paper, individual type hammers behind the paper, one for each column on the page (120 or 132), pushed the paper from behind, causing the front of the paper at that spot to push forward into the ribbon with the character behind it, causing the paper to strike the character, {{rather than the other way}} around, as had been done in the past. Each hammer was moved by a powerful electromagnet, with its coil connected to a high current drive circuit, such that the hammer could be forced out to hit the paper within only a few milliseconds, at exactly the right time to strike the correct character on the chain as it came by.|$|R

40|$|We {{implement}} a binary collision approximation to study pulse propagation {{in a chain}} of o-rings. In particular, we arrive at analytic results from which the pulse velocity is obtained by simple quadrature. The predicted pulse velocity is compared to the velocity obtained from the far more resource-intensive numerical integration of the equations of motion. We study chains without precompression, chains precompressed by a constant force at the chain ends (constant precompression), and chains precompressed by gravity (variable precompression). The application of the binary collision approximation <b>to</b> precompressed <b>chains</b> provides an important generalization of a successful theory that had {{up to this point}} only been implemented <b>to</b> <b>chains</b> without precompression, that is, <b>to</b> <b>chains</b> in a sonic vacuum...|$|R
