25|$|Eurocom ported a {{compressed}} and scaled down {{version for}} the Game Boy. It was hindered {{by the lack}} of color, lack of graphical detail due to both processor and small screen size, choppy animations, and a lack of buttons, which made it hard to control. This version was also ported to the Game Gear, which included color graphics, but still suffered from all of the other problems of the Game Boy version. A direct port of the Game Gear version was also brought to the Sega Master System, but only in Brazil. However, it only has 4 levels, and the boss in What <b>The</b> <b>Heck?</b> <b>is</b> missing.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Aja wrote {{a script}} with Gregory Levasseur, and {{production}} {{was held by}} Aton Soumache and Dimitri Rassom under Onyx Films and Studio 37 with a budget of more than $100 million. Later, a teaser poster depicting promotional concept art for Cobra: The Space Pirate, along with a release date scheduled for mid-2013, was unveiled. In September 2013, however, Aja admitted that making the film will be [...] "very hard" [...] since [...] "to do {{a new kind of}} Star Wars, [...] expensive" [...] though he stated [...] "we are trying everything, we will make it." [...] In July 2014, Aja revealed it was estimated that the project would require a budget of over $150 million, and that he was seeking to have an A-list actor to help attract a funder. One of his main difficulties, Aja said in 2015, was to decide who would star the film: [...] "When I think 'who <b>the</b> <b>heck</b> <b>is</b> going to play that Cobra?', I become unable to move forward." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Hekawi {{appear to}} be a very small tribe {{consisting}} of only one small village. They live an indeterminate distance from Fort Courage, though the directions to their camp are described as: [...] "Make right turn at big rock that look like bear, then make left turn at big bear that look like rock".

5000|$|In the US Straight to Hell {{was rated}} [...] "R" [...] for {{violence}} and language. The latter reason caught the producers by surprise, as the writers deliberately refrained from including {{any sort of}} profanity in the dialogue. Even the word [...] "hell" [...] appears only in the title (at one point a character quite noticeably says [...] "what <b>the</b> <b>heck</b> <b>is</b> going on here?"), and the insults that fly before a showdown are no worse than [...] "go boil yer head!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Despite its {{eventual}} success, {{the group}} initially had doubts if radio would play it {{due to the}} track's heaviness.

5000|$|One oft-told {{story is}} that on short flies to center or left-center, center fielder Ashburn would collide with shortstop Elio Chacón.

5000|$|Before {{they even}} {{got in the}} ring for the World War 3 match, the Four Horsemen and the Dungeon of Doom battled outside of Ring #3, with Benoit, Sullivan (Taskmaster) and Big Bubba battling into the crowd.

For all its oddities and confusion, the ending come across as very powerful and quite sad." [...] It was appreciated that in the film's extrapolating from events surrounding the life of Philip K. Dick, it acted as an homage both to the man's fiction and to the 1970s. They praised Taryn Manning for showing [...] "some serious acting chops as Nikki and described Bill Pullman's Frick as [...] "simply brilliant.

5000|$|While Love {{was still}} being edited, Eubank began writing a second screenplay, The Signal. He collaborated on the script with fellow screenwriters David Frigerio and his brother, Carlyle Eubank. In an {{interview}} Eubank described his first thoughts for the project: [...] "I'm {{a big fan of}} The Twilight Zone, of what Rod Serling used to do as a storyteller, and I always wanted to do one of those - a story with intangibility and strangeness that makes you say, 'What <b>the</b> <b>heck</b> <b>is</b> going on?' I’d been thinking about the concept of an individual thrust into a specific and extreme situation, the true nature of which this person would have to uncover." [...] Before production could begin, Eubank worked as Second Unit Director on the 2012 Regency film Broken City. Soon after, The Signal found producers: Brian Kavanaugh-Jones of Insidious and Tyler Davidson of Take Shelter and production could begin.|$|E

[...] At least one contributor to the magazine, author Steve Perry, has publicly complained that he never gave permission for his work to be uploaded ("they didn't say a word in my direction"), {{and it has been}} noted that all issues containing the work of Harlan Ellison have apparently been taken down.
