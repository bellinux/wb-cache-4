25|$|An {{example of}} a control system is a car's cruise control, which is a device {{designed}} to maintain vehicle speed at a constant desired or reference speed provided by the driver. The controller is the cruise control, the plant is the car, and the system is {{the car and the}} cruise control. The system output is the car's speed, and the control itself is the engine's <b>throttle</b> <b>position</b> which determines how much power the engine delivers.|$|E

Early EMS systems used an analogue computer to accomplish this, but as embedded systems dropped in price and became fast enough {{to keep up with the}} changing inputs at high revolutions, digital systems started to appear.|$|E

This study is the series activity of research, design and development of conversion kit for gas fuelled vehicle in the author laboratory. The SI engine that used in this study is Honda L 15 A, four cylinders, 1, 497 cm 3 using electronic control unit. Three different fuel system namely standard gasoline fuel system, commercially CNG conversion kit and proposed CNG conversion kit designed by Research Centre for Electrical Power and Mechatronics–Indonesian Institute of Sciences, all of them utilized with fuel injection system and electronic control unit were used in this study. The test was conducted on the 25 % and 80 % <b>throttle</b> opening <b>position</b> with engine speed over 4, 800 rpm. The results show that the maximum brake power at 25 % <b>throttle</b> opening <b>position</b> of SI engine using commercially CNG conversion kit (19. 00 kW) is almost same with SI engine using proposed CNG conversion kit (19. 68 kW), while for 80 % <b>throttle</b> opening <b>position</b> the maximum brake power of SI engine using proposed CNG conversion kit (38. 67 kW) is higher than commercially CNG conversion kit (34. 29 kW).

25|$|Cruise control {{automatically}} {{controls the}} rate of motion of a motor vehicle. The driver sets the speed and the system will take over the throttle {{of the car to}} maintain the same speed. Cruise control was invented in 1945 by a blind inventor and mechanical engineer named Ralph Teetor. His idea was born out of the frustration of riding in a car driven by his lawyer, who kept speeding up and slowing down as he talked. The first car with Teetor's system was the Chrysler Imperial in 1958. This system calculated ground speed based on driveshaft rotations and used a solenoid to vary <b>throttle</b> <b>position</b> as needed.|$|E
25|$|On 15 February 2017 Toyota {{recalled}} all of {{the roughly}} 2,800 zero-emission Mirai {{cars on the road}} due to problems with the output voltage generated by their fuel cell system. According to Toyota, under unique driving conditions, such as if the accelerator pedal is depressed to the wide open <b>throttle</b> <b>position</b> after driving on a long descent while using cruise control, there was a possibility the output voltage generated by the fuel cell boost converter could exceed the maximum voltage. Toyota dealers will update the fuel cell system software at no cost to the customer, it said. The process will take about half an hour, it said.|$|E
25|$|Modern EMSs read in {{data from}} various sensors about the {{crankshaft}} position, intake manifold temperature, {{intake manifold pressure}} (or intake air volume), <b>throttle</b> <b>position,</b> fuel mixture via the oxygen sensor, detonation via a knock sensor, and exhaust gas temperature sensors. The EMS then uses the collected data to precisely determine how much fuel to deliver and when and how far to advance the ignition timing. With electronic ignition systems, individual cylinders can have their own individual timing so that timing can be as aggressive as possible per cylinder without fuel detonation. As a result, sophisticated electronic ignition systems can be both more fuel efficient, and produce better performance over their counterparts.|$|E
50|$|Retarding {{ignition}} timing reduces four-stroking, as it allows {{more time for}} scavenging to take effect. Two-stroke engines, when running at low power, are less sensitive to {{ignition timing}} changes than four-stroke engine. If the timing is retarded for low <b>throttle</b> <b>positions,</b> from perhaps 35° BTDC at normal speeds to TDC or even 10° after TDC at slow idle, the engine runs well without four-stroking. Opening up the throttle and simultaneously advancing the timing, allows a rapid pickup in speed. This system is widely used for outboard motors, particularly when used to pull water skiers.|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} analysis is being performed {{of the engine}} performance and exhaust emission on a gasoline and compressed natural gas (CNG) fueled retrofitted spark ignition car engine. A new 1. 6 L, 4 -cylinder petrol engine was converted to the computer incorporated bi-fuel system which operated with either gasoline or CNG using an electronically controlled solenoid actuated valve mechanism. The engine brake power, brake specific fuel consumption, brake thermal efficiency, exhaust gas temperature and exhaust emissions (unburnt hydrocarbon, carbon mono-oxide, oxygen and carbon dioxides) were measured over a range of speed variations at 50 % and 80 % <b>throttle</b> <b>positions</b> through a computer based data acquisition and control system. Comparative analysis of the experimental results showed 19. 25 % and 10. 86 % reduction in brake power and 15. 96 % and 14. 68 % reduction in brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) at 50 % and 80 % <b>throttle</b> <b>positions</b> respectively while the engine was fueled with CNG compared to that with the gasoline. Whereas, the retrofitted engine produced 1. 6 % higher brake thermal efficiency and 24. 21 % higher exhaust gas temperature at 80 % throttle had produced an average of 40. 84 % higher NOx emission over the speed range of 1500 – 5500 rpm at 80 % throttle.

Instead a mechanism lowers the jet assembly, which has the same effect as the needle rising in normal operation - namely increasing the supply of fuel so that the carburettor will now deliver an enriched mixture at all engine speeds and <b>throttle</b> <b>positions.</b> The 'choke' mechanism on an SU carburettor usually also incorporates a system for holding the throttle plate slightly open to raise the engine's idling speed and prevent stalling at low speeds due to the rich mixture.|$|R
25|$|Only minor grille and {{taillight}} lens revisions {{highlighted the}} 1981 Delta 88s. The gasoline 350 Rocket V8 was {{dropped from the}} option list, leaving only the diesel version available. All other engines including the Buick 231 V6 and Oldsmobile 260 and 307 Rocket V8s were continued. All gasoline engines received GM's new Computer Command Control engine management system. This system was the forerunner, and surprisingly similar to today's OBDII which is standard on all cars sold in the United States. The system read various parameters such as vehicle speed, <b>throttle</b> <b>position,</b> engine RPM's, coolant temperature, and the oxygen content of the exhaust to provide the correct air/fuel mixture for any given driving condition. Also new for 1981 was GM's Turbo-Hydramatic 200-4R transmission, which added an overdrive gear and torque converter clutch (TCC) to contribute to fuel economy and engine longevity. The sporty Holiday 88 coupe was offered {{for the last time}} this year.|$|E
2500|$|A {{primitive}} way {{to implement}} cruise control {{is simply to}} lock the <b>throttle</b> <b>position</b> when the driver engages cruise control. [...] However, if the cruise control is engaged on a stretch of flat road, then the car will travel slower going uphill and faster when going downhill. This type of controller is called an open-loop controller {{because there is no}} feedback; no measurement of the system output (the car's speed) is used to alter the control (the <b>throttle</b> <b>position.)</b> As a result, the controller cannot compensate for changes acting on the car, like a change in the slope of the road.|$|E
2500|$|Locomotive power output, {{and thus}} speed, is {{typically}} {{controlled by the}} engine driver using a stepped or [...] "notched" [...] throttle that produces binary-like electrical signals corresponding to <b>throttle</b> <b>position.</b> [...] This basic design lends itself well to multiple unit (MU) operation by producing discrete conditions that assure that all units in a consist respond {{in the same way}} to <b>throttle</b> <b>position.</b> [...] Binary encoding also helps to minimize the number of trainlines (electrical connections) that are required to pass signals from unit to unit. [...] For example, only four trainlines are required to encode all possible throttle positions.|$|E

25|$|The {{two most}} common methods used for testing {{centrifugal}} compressors is to test along lines of constant shaft speed or along lines of constant throttle. If the shaft speed is held constant, test points are taken along a constant speed line by changing <b>throttle</b> <b>positions.</b> In contrast, if a throttle valve is held constant, test points are established by changing speed (common gas turbine practice). The map shown in Figure 5.2 illustrate {{the most common}} method; lines of constant speed. In this case we see data points connected via straight lines at speeds of 50%, 71%, 87%, and 100% RPM.

In this research, an experimental work was conducted on a 1. 6 L 4 -cylinder multi-port injection engine. The engine was retrofitted with a Liquid Sequential Injection (LSI) LPG system. Its performance in terms of brake power, brake torque, brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and exhaust gas emissions (CO, CO 2, HC, O 2, and NOx) were evaluated from 1500 rpm to 4000 rpm with half-open and wide open <b>throttle</b> <b>positions.</b> In comparison with gasoline, the brake torque and brake power for LPG were higher, but the BSFC and exhaust emission of CO and CO 2 for LPG are lower...|$|R
2500|$|In a {{closed-loop}} control system, {{data from a}} sensor monitoring the car's speed (the system output) enters a controller which continuously compares the quantity representing the speed with the reference quantity representing the desired speed. The difference, called the error, determines the <b>throttle</b> <b>position</b> (the control). The result is to match the car's speed to the reference speed (maintain the desired system output). Now, when the car goes uphill, {{the difference between the}} input (the sensed speed) and the reference continuously determines the <b>throttle</b> <b>position.</b> As the sensed speed drops below the reference, the difference increases, the throttle opens, and engine power increases, speeding up the vehicle. In this way, the controller dynamically counteracts changes to the car's speed. [...] The central idea of these control systems is the feedback loop, the controller affects the system output, which in turn is measured and fed back to the controller.|$|E

2500|$|In 1990, Mitsubishi {{released}} the Diamante (Sigma) in Japan. It featured a new electronically controlled active trace & {{traction control system}} (the first integration of these two systems in the world) that Mitsubishi developed (see Mitsubishi AWC). Simply named TCL in 1990, the system has now evolved into Mitsubishi's modern Active Skid and Traction Control (ASTC) system. Developed to help the driver maintain the intended line through a corner; an onboard computer monitored several vehicle operating parameters through various sensors. When too much throttle has been used when taking a curve, engine output and braking are automatically regulated to ensure the proper line through a curve and to provide the proper amount of traction under various road surface conditions. While conventional traction control systems at the time featured only a slip control function, Mitsubishi's newly developed TCL system had a preventive (active) safety function which improved the course tracing performance by automatically adjusting the traction force (called [...] "trace control") thereby restraining the development of excessive lateral acceleration while turning. Although not a ‘proper’ modern stability control system, trace control monitors steering angle, <b>throttle</b> <b>position</b> and individual wheel speeds {{although there is no}} yaw input. The TCL system's standard wheel slip control function enables better traction on slippery surfaces or during cornering. In addition to the TCL system's individual effect, it also works together with Diamante's electronic controlled suspension and four-wheel steering that Mitsubishi had equipped to improve total handling and performance.|$|E
