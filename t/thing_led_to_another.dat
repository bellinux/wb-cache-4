25|$|Munroe {{had then}} made a {{business}} out of making lead pencils. He made the graphite formula for his pencils in secret, with only {{the help of his}} wife. The business was quite successful. By 1814 he had made nearly 175,000 pencils, which sold for about six thousand dollars, a very large amount of money at the time. When the war with England ended there were better pencils available from Europe and his profits were erased by these better imports. Munroe figured it was pointless to try to compete against these superior products so took up his normal trade of cabinet-making. He also made tooth brushes and watchmaker's brushes, also the first made in the United States. During this interim time {{he went back to the}} drawing board to do further experimenting with his secret lead pencil paste. One <b>thing</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> until he came up with a powdered graphite paste product that would make its mark.|$|E

2500|$|These {{are things}} {{related to the}} past and the {{environment}} I found myself in at the time. In the early '90s, there were all these different youth gangs in Norway and one <b>thing</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another.</b> I was involved in gang fights and had false friends [...] There was no political disposition – not with me nor any of my friends. But you had to profess allegiance to a certain group if you wanted to defend yourself and not get your ass kicked. [...] But there have definitely been changes and an evolution in my thinking. I'm a different person today.|$|E

2500|$|Roger Troutman {{developed}} [...] "I Want to Be Your Man" [...] {{around the}} theme of romantic commitment. [...] "Guys have trouble committing and women want us to commit," [...] he explained to authors Adam White and Fred Bronson. [...] "Women want us to admit that we don't want to commit." [...] Troutman took the idea and began working on a track similar in style to [...] "Computer Love," [...] a 1986 hit for his band Zapp. [...] "I was playing in Dallas and [...] flew out. We sat {{in the hotel room}} one day and wrote the song. I talked to him about what I was trying to say and one <b>thing</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another.</b> We came back and recorded a vocal." ...|$|E

60|$|The Italian gentleman on Colville's {{right was}} politely {{offering}} him the salad, {{which had been}} left for the guests to pass to one another. Colville thanked him in Italian, {{and they began to}} talk of Italian affairs.

5000|$|Gary Marx: [...] "When we {{were making}} album Andrew was {{effectively}} splitting with his long-term girlfriend and I was close to leaving the band. These two <b>things</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> a number of references in the lyrics, which seemed to cover his farewells to us both." ...|$|R
5000|$|This {{caused some}} {{aggregation}} in ARD and the EBU, the contest's organisers, because, {{due to its}} population size Germany {{was one of the}} biggest financial contributors to the contest.

If you want to know,"--Westover faltered, and then went on--"she began to be kind to you because she was afraid that you might think she didn't take your coming home second-cabin in the right way; and one <b>thing</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another.</b> You mustn't blame her for what's happened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{some way}} we struck {{up quite a}} friendship, this young fellow and I. He seemed to take a fancy {{to me from the}} first, and within two days of our meeting he came to see me at Lee. One <b>thing</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another,</b> and it ended in his {{inviting}} me out to spend a few days at his house, Wisteria Lodge, between Esher and Oxshott. Yesterday evening I went to Esher to fulfil this engagement.|$|E

Then one <b>thing</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another,</b> until he was {{face to face with}} dealing that took on crooked form. To protect himself he bound men to him. And so the gang developed. Many powerful gangs have developed that way out here. He could not control them. He became involved with them.|$|E
5000|$|... “If I didn't {{stick it}} in (during) the warm up, the {{distributor}} drive would have probably gone in the warm-up so we would have found the problem before the race, so one <b>thing</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> another," [...] said Ingall.

50|$|Although {{he tried}} to {{consolidate}} the Caliphate, the raising of taxes (to pay for mosques amongst other <b>things)</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> heavy opposition from the Muslim clerics.

Sarah was thirty-three, and Mary was twenty-nine when I married. We were just as happy as the day was long when we set up house together, and in all Liverpool there was no better woman than my Mary. And then we asked Sarah up for a week, and the week grew into a month, and one <b>thing</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another,</b> until she {{was just one of}} ourselves.|$|E

And one <b>thing</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> until, by easy stages, {{they had}} arrived at the point where she was saying that she didn't know if he was aware of it, but if he didn't knock off starchy foods and do {{exercises}} every morning, he would be getting as fat as a pig, and he was talking about this modern habit of girls putting make-up on their faces, of which he had always disapproved. This continued for a while, {{and then there was a}} loud pop and the air was full of mangled fragments of their engagement. I'm distracted about it. Thank goodness you've come, Bertie." ...|$|E
60|$|He saw {{a danger}} in staying away too long, but his {{contract}} was {{only beginning to}} be profitable. Besides, one <b>thing</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another,</b> {{and a number of}} extras, for which the pay was good, had been added to the original plans. Then he had been asked to undertake another job and had arranged to go over the ground with Kerr and Norton that morning. In a way, he would sooner have left it alone, because it would keep him longer from home, but the terms offered a strong inducement to stop. Glancing at his watch, he saw it was nearly time to meet the engineers.|$|E

50|$|Addleshaw Booth & Co {{was formed}} in 1997 by a merger between the Leeds-based Booth & Co. and the Manchester-based Addleshaw Sons & Latham.

You see, ma'am, I've {{thought all}} along {{it was a}} bit awkward for them here, they not being so much used to looking after things, and I asked leave to come and help now and then. Of course, they said that I could not be allowed to serve for hire in Altruria; and one <b>thing</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another,</b> and I said it would really be a favor to me, and I didn't expect money for my work, for I did not suppose I should ever be where I could use it again, but if they would let me come here and do it for--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Absolutely. You see, {{it appears}} there's a chappie unknown for whom Maud has an {{absolute}} pash. It seems she met this sportsman up in Wales last summer. She {{was caught in}} the rain, and he happened to be passing and rallied round with his rain-coat, and one <b>thing</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another.</b> Always raining in Wales, what! Good fishing, though, here and there. Well, what I mean is, this cove was so deucedly civil, and all that, that now she won't look at anybody else. He's the blue-eyed boy, and everybody else is an also-ran, with about as much chance as a blind man with one arm {{trying to get out of}} a bunker with a tooth-pick." ...|$|E

She knocked at the door--surprise visit, I guess, for he kept his life in {{water-tight}} compartments--he let her in, couldn't keep her in the street. She told him how she had traced him, reproached him. One <b>thing</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another,</b> and then with that dagger so handy the end soon came. It wasn't all done in an instant, though, for these chairs were all swept over yonder, and he had one in his hand {{as if he had}} tried to hold her off with it. We've got it all clear as if we had seen it." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{bankruptcies}} {{and eventual}} closures of Borders and Linens n' <b>Things</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> two new junior anchors at the center: a Nordstrom Rack opened {{in place of}} Linens n' Things, while Forever 21 moved from a smaller in-line space to the former Borders store.

60|$|Andrew had {{an uncomfortable}} feeling that Geraldine {{and her father}} were right. One <b>thing</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another,</b> and he might be drawn irresistibly into {{a long series of}} {{business}} complications, which was by no means what he had at first contemplated. Nevertheless, if his services were of any value, Allinson's had the first claim on them. He dismissed the matter when Frobisher suggested that they go in to supper. Frobisher was witty, Geraldine charmingly cordial, and it was with regret that Andrew took his leave. Geraldine walked to the pier with him and he noticed a gentleness in her face that set his heart to beating. He thought the soft dusk emphasized her beauty by etherealizing it. When they reached the steps she turned to him with a smile.|$|E
60|$|It {{was in a}} {{state of}} quiet contentment that Jimmy stood on his bridge, as the Shasta steamed past the Stanley pines into sight of the {{clustering}} roofs of Vancouver. His first voyage had been an unqualified success in every respect, and it was clear that the Shasta had done considerably more than cover her working expenses. This was in several ways a great relief to him, since it promised to obviate any difficulty in providing for his father's comfort, and also opened up the prospect of a career for himself. Jordan had assured him before he sailed that they would have no great trouble in raising funds to purchase another boat if the results of the venture warranted it. He had also said that since one <b>thing</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another,</b> there was no reason why the Shasta Company should not run several steamers by and by, in which case Jimmy would naturally become commodore-captain or general superintendent of the fleet.|$|E
6000|$|... "You must {{rise above}} this," [...] said Duane to her. [...] "I {{expected}} this to ruin you. But {{your father is}} alive. He will live it down. I'm sure I can promise you he'll be free. Perhaps back there in Louisiana the dishonor will never be known. This country is far from your old home. And even in San Antonio and Austin a man's evil repute means little. Then the line between a rustler and a rancher is hard to draw in these wild border days. Rustling is stealing cattle, and I once heard a well-known rancher say that all rich cattlemen had done a little stealing Your father drifted out here, and, like a good many others, he succeeded. It's perhaps just as well not to split hairs, to judge him by the law and morality of a civilized country. Some way or other he drifted in with bad men. Maybe a deal that was honest somehow tied his hands. This matter of land, water, a few stray head of stock had to be decided out of court. I'm sure in his case he never realized where he was drifting. Then one <b>thing</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another,</b> until he was {{face to face with}} dealing that took on crooked form. To protect himself he bound men to him. And so the gang developed. Many powerful gangs have developed that way out here. He could not control them. He became involved with them. And eventually their dealings became deliberately and boldly dishonest. That meant the inevitable spilling of blood sooner or later, and so he grew into the leader because he was the strongest. Whatever he is to be judged for, I think he could have been infinitely worse." ...|$|E

Then you see, my father explained every step as it came, and as one <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another,</b> I learnt them without meeting with any one special difficulty; but I can quite see {{that it would be}} very hard for anyone to learn to work it out without having been coached from the start.” ...|$|R
