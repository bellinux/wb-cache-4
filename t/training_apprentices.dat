5|$|Once a kit {{has reached}} six moons old, they become ‘{{apprentice}}s’. As {{a mark of}} this, each kit is now given the suffix ‘paw’. For example, ‘Graykit’ would become ‘Graypaw’. An apprentice is then assigned to a ‘mentor’. Mentors are often carefully chosen {{in order to fulfill}} an apprentice’s full potential; for example, a rather highly-strung apprentice would be given to a calmer mentor, whilst a more timid apprentice would be given to a mentor known for their bravery. It is the job of a mentor to train their apprentice for any given situation, teaching them to hunt, fight, and patrol borders. Apprentices move out of the nursery and sleep in their own separate den. In addition to <b>training,</b> <b>apprentices</b> are also tasked with keeping the camp clean.|$|E

25|$|The {{education}} and training of the large workforce, the attempts to standardise manufacturing and commercial practices and the moderating of commercial rivalry between supply companies prompted the founding of associations of gas managers, first in Scotland in 1861. A British Association of Gas Managers was formed in 1863 in Manchester and this, after a turbulent history, became {{the foundation of the}} Institute of Gas Engineers (IGE). In 1903, the reconstructed Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) initiated courses for students of gas manufacture in the City and Guilds of London Institute. The IGE was granted the Royal Charter in 1929. Universities were slow to respond {{to the needs of the}} industry and it was not until 1908 that the first Professorship of Coal Gas and Fuel Industries was founded at the University of Leeds. In 1926, the Gas Light and Coke Company opened Watson House adjacent to Nine Elms Gas Works. At first, this was a scientific laboratory. Later it included a centre for <b>training</b> <b>apprentices</b> but its major contribution to the industry was its gas appliance testing facilities, which were made available to the whole industry, including gas appliance manufacturers. Using this facility, the industry established not only safety but also performance standards for both the manufacture of gas appliances and their servicing in customers' homes and commercial premises.|$|E
30|$|Moreover, {{the labor}} market {{environment}} shows a strong association with a firm’s willingness to <b>train</b> <b>apprentices.</b> The probability to <b>train</b> <b>apprentices</b> is almost twice as high for small firms (both internationalized and domestic) that have difficulties to find suitable skilled workers on the external labor market.|$|R

A second issue, centered on the Ancient One <b>training</b> <b>apprentices</b> in the magical arts at Kamar-Taj, was {{released a}} month later. Derrickson, Cumberbatch, Swinton, Ejiofor, McAdams, Mikkelsen, and Wong attended San Diego Comic-Con 2016, where they debuted an exclusive clip and the second trailer for the film. The next month, the same Comic-Con clip was screened at the Asia Pop Comic Convention Manila. In September 2016, an additional prelude comic was released, centered on Kaecilius, while behind the scenes footage was released as a special feature on the [...] Blu-ray. Also in September, Marvel, in partnership with Dolby Laboratories, Broadcom, Synchrony Bank, and Society for Science & the Public, announced [...] "The Magic of STEM Challenge", aimed at females aged 15 through 18 in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics education) fields. The challenge was for contestants to submit videos of them finding mentors to explore ideas once thought to only be possible with magic. Five winners would attend the world premiere of the film, and receive a tour of Walt Disney Studios, as well as a $1,000 saving account from Synchrony Bank, with one grand prize winner receiving a mentorship with Walt Disney Studio's Digital Team.|$|E

30|$|This paper draws {{together}} the latest {{evidence on the}} costs and benefits to employers of providing apprenticeship training and considers how the financial risk attached to this training investment might be overcome. We take, as prima facie evidence that there are ways to reduce this risk {{the fact that so many}} employers in particular sectors continue to <b>train</b> <b>apprentices</b> despite incurring substantial monetary costs. Nevertheless, we see that even when employers are inclined to <b>train</b> <b>apprentices</b> there is room for them to do more. In reality, employer engagement is very finely balanced which can put firm performance and wider economic performance at risk due to inadequate skills development.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{solutions}} {{put forward}} {{so far are}} [...] "contractual education" [...] (Auftragsausbildung) and state-run courses.

30|$|In contrast, underage costs {{derive from}} {{not having enough}} skilled workers (or <b>trained</b> <b>apprentices)</b> {{available}} when needed. Consuming <b>trained</b> <b>apprentices</b> beyond built inventories makes the firm experience delays and deficiencies, thus causing lost business opportunities unless the firm finds substitute workers in due time (Cappelli 2008). Hiring skilled workers from the external labor market brings its own costs, though, which are comparable to ordering costs of inventory. Therefore, if firms undershoot demand, they face a risk of being short of inventory. Since expected costs of a shortage decrease monotonically with increasing inventory, we expect a firm’s underage costs to be positively related {{to the level of}} skills inventory held (Backes-Gellner 1996).|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the determinants (a) of the propensity of Swiss firms to <b>train</b> <b>apprentices</b> and (b) of the intensity of <b>apprentice</b> <b>training</b> {{as measured by the}} employment share of apprentices.

In a further step, we analyzed the impact of <b>apprentice</b> <b>training</b> on labour productivity when <b>apprentice</b> <b>training</b> is considered as an additional production factor in the framework of a production function. We found that the skill composition of the employment, innovation activities, firm age, labour costs, capital intensity, and competitive pressures all play a positive or negative role, even if not at the same extent, in determining the propensity and/or intensity of <b>apprentice</b> <b>training.</b> A further finding was that training propensity and/o training intensity correlate negatively with labour productivity. start-ups, training, innovation, firm age...|$|R

50|$|The Company {{was founded}} in 1463 and {{received}} a Royal Charter in 1605. The Company was a classical medieval guild governing trade and maintaining quality and inspection of fruit imported into the City. It was also responsible for <b>training</b> <b>apprentices,</b> caring for members and doing charitable works. The connection of the Company to the fruit trade had diminished by {{the late nineteenth century}} although it remained a City institution. In the latter twentieth century its connections to the trade were revitalised, diverting it from the course of becoming a purely charitable institution, as many other Livery Companies have done. It is known for its special recognition of individuals in the fruit industry and for its support of research and development concerned with the industry. Currently, over half the Livery is made up of industry representation.|$|E

5000|$|Accompaniment to {{the village}} songs is played on various {{traditional}} instruments, {{the most important of}} which is the kokles, a type of box zither related to the Lithuanian kanklės and other Baltic psalteries. In the 1970s, artists like Jānis Poriķis and Valdis Muktupāvels led a revival in kokles music, which had only survived in the Courland and Lettgallia regions. The Latvian-exile community abroad, especially in the United States, has also kept kokles traditions alive. In the last hundred years a new kind of kokles was developed, with many more strings, halftones levelers and other improvements that expand the capacities of the instrument to play not only modal music but, in other point of view, displeased more traditional musicians. This kind of instrument is called [...] "concert kokles".
