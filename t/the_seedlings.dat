5|$|In April 1987, Western Australia's Department of Environment and Conservation burnt {{part of one}} {{population}} in an experimental regeneration fire. The mature plants were killed, and <b>the</b> <b>seedlings</b> that volunteered did not survive the summer drought. A Matchstick Banksia Recovery Team was established in 1995, and over time they succeeded in establishing {{a large number of}} seedlings. A large adult population was destroyed by bushfire in 1996, causing further concern, but this was followed by the recruitment of large numbers of seedlings.|$|E
5|$|The {{bright green}} {{cotyledon}} leaves of <b>the</b> <b>seedlings</b> are oblong to linear {{in shape and}} measure 1.5cm (0.6in) long by 0.3cm (0.1in) wide. The greenish red hypocotyl is hairy, as are the stems of young plants. The hairy seedling leaves are crowded and oppositely arranged. They measure 0.7–1.3cm (0.2–0.5in) in length and have recurved margins. Young plants often begin branching within {{their first year of}} life.|$|E
5|$|A recent test of {{this model}} {{involved}} a reciprocal transplants of seedlings of 20 species of trees between clay soils (nutrient rich) and white sand (nutrient poor) to determine whether trade-offs between growth rate and defenses restrict species to one habitat. When planted in white sand and protected from herbivores, seedlings originating from clay outgrew those originating from the nutrient-poor sand, but {{in the presence of}} herbivores <b>the</b> <b>seedlings</b> originating from white sand performed better, likely due to their higher levels of constitutive carbon-based defenses. These finding suggest that defensive strategies limit the habitats of some plants.|$|E

30|$|Through the {{observation}} of the test process, {{it is found that}} the reason for the breakage of <b>the</b> <b>seedling</b> ejection in <b>the</b> bowl is that the contact area between the push rod mechanism and <b>the</b> bowl <b>seedling</b> tray is too small. The uneven force <b>the</b> <b>seedling</b> plate bears in the process of transporting the pushing disk leads to a certain degree of inclination on the conveyor belt, which affects the positioning accuracy of <b>the</b> <b>seedling</b> during <b>the</b> process of ejection. It can be considered to increase the effective contact area between the push rod and <b>the</b> <b>seedling</b> plate and to improve the stability of the pushing process to reduce the breakage rate of pushing <b>seedlings.</b> <b>The</b> reason of <b>the</b> failure <b>seedling</b> dropping is that the contact area between the grafted claw and <b>the</b> bowl <b>seedling</b> is too small, which leads to large clamping pressure, resulting in the collapse of the pot and dropping failure. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>seedling</b> claw should be designed according to the characteristics of the substrate. The clamping force is matched with the mechanical characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>seedling,</b> which can increase the success rate of seedling feeding and impugn and rove the conveying efficiency.|$|R
50|$|If the radicle {{begins to}} decay, <b>the</b> <b>seedling</b> {{undergoes}} preemergence damping-off. This disease {{appears on the}} radicle as darkened spots. Eventually, it causes death of <b>the</b> <b>seedling.</b>|$|R
5|$|Experiments {{have shown}} that when more pollen {{is applied to the}} stigma, as well as the fruit {{containing}} more seeds and being larger (the xenia effect mentioned above), the germination of the seeds is also faster and more likely, and <b>the</b> <b>seedlings</b> are larger. Various combinations of mineral nutrients and light have a significant effect during the various stages of plant growth. These effects vary significantly between the different species of Cucurbita. A type of stored phosphorus called phytate forms in seed tissues as spherical crystalline intrusions in protein bodies called globoids. Along with other nutrients, phytate is used completely during seedling growth. Heavy metal contamination, including cadmium, has a significant negative impact on plant growth. Cucurbita plants grown in the spring tend to grow larger than those grown in the autumn.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} of conserving B.brownii in its present disease-exposed locations, it is an especially suitable candidate for ex situ conservation measures, such as the cold-storage of seed, and the translocation of plants to disease-free locations. Seed of B.brownii has been collected by Western Australia's Threatened Flora Seed Centre, and placed in cold-storage both in Perth and at Kew's Millennium Seed Bank. This includes seed collected from populations that have since become extinct. In 2008, some of this seed was germinated, and seedlings were planted at a location near Albany. Genetic analysis of <b>the</b> <b>seedlings</b> revealed some genetic diversity that was not present in any extant population. The conservation of these seeds had thus preserved some of the species' genetic diversity that would otherwise have been lost through population extinction, providing a powerful example of the importance of seed banking to conservation efforts. A seed orchard was planted in 2007, and by 2010 this had yielded over 400 disease-free, healthy plants, some of which had grown {{more than three times the}} rate of those in the wild. A 2007 seedling flowered for the first time at Wakehurst Place in February 2011.|$|E
5|$|Iridomyrmex {{primarily}} {{feeds on}} sweet {{foods such as}} nectar and honeydew. They hunt for insects and other ants to feed to their young, and workers are particularly attracted to seeds with elaiosomes. They collect these seeds, remove the elaiosomes, and then discard the seeds. <b>The</b> <b>seedlings</b> that sprout from these seeds benefit from proximity to the aggressive Iridomyrmex ants, giving them {{a better chance of}} survival. Colonies sometimes nest in termite mounds, and so the termites are regularly preyed on by Iridomyrmex; no evidence for any kind of relationship (other than a predatory one) is known. Juvenile cane toads are often preyed on, as certain Iridomyrmex species such as I. purpureus and I. ruburrus are immune to the toxins released by the cane toads. As a result, placing Iridomyrmex nests in habitats which house cane toads have been suggested as a method of controlling the cane toad population. The meat ant is the only known ant in Australia that feeds on guano.|$|E
30|$|The {{loading and}} {{unloading}} detection system mainly detects the position change of <b>the</b> <b>seedling</b> plate from <b>the</b> <b>seedling</b> storage mechanism to <b>the</b> <b>seedling</b> plate conveyor belt and obtains the position signal as the action control signal of {{loading and unloading}}. The system includes PVDF pressure sensor, travel switch, limit sensor, and a single lamp. The PVDF pressure sensor is arranged {{in the middle of}} <b>the</b> slot wheel-type <b>seedling</b> storage tray and is in the same vertical plane with the push rod mechanism, which is used to detect whether <b>the</b> <b>seedling</b> storage tray is empty or not. It also lights the single lamp and instructs the start of the sprocket drive motor. The stroke switch mainly detects the displacement of the sprocket drive of <b>the</b> <b>seedling</b> storage tray and determines whether <b>the</b> <b>seedling</b> storage tray reaches the feeding position. Its signal is used to instruct the push rod mechanism to push <b>the</b> <b>seedling</b> tray to <b>the</b> conveyor belt. The limit sensor is installed at the starting position of the conveyor belt, and its signal is used to control the reset action of the pushing mechanism.|$|R
30|$|The {{conveying}} {{monitoring module}} comprises a seedling storage monitoring module, a seedling taking monitoring module, and a cup-type circulating conveying monitoring module. The monitoring module includes a pressure sensor {{and a lack}} of seedling indicator light. A PVDF pressure sensor (response time <[*] 1  ms, response point <[*] 200  g, range 0 – 50  kg) was arranged on <b>the</b> slot-wheeled <b>seedling</b> storage tray and used to detect whether there is a potted vegetable seedling tray waiting to be delivered. According to the change of the pressure signal, the controller directs the motor to drive the sprocket wheel of the storage plate and carries out the transfer of <b>the</b> <b>seedling</b> plate. By setting a stroke switch on the sprocket conveyor belt, the position of <b>the</b> <b>seedling</b> tray conveying is detected, and the push rod mechanism is triggered to perform the pushing action, and <b>the</b> <b>seedling</b> tray is moved from <b>the</b> <b>seedling</b> storage mechanism to <b>the</b> <b>seedling</b> tray conveyor belt. A finite position sensor is arranged at the junction between the conveyor belt of <b>the</b> <b>seedling</b> tray and <b>the</b> push rod mechanism. When it is detected that <b>the</b> <b>seedling</b> tray enters <b>the</b> conveyor belt from the storage mechanism, the signal is sent to the controller to stop the pushing action. The stability of the conveying action is ensured. The abnormal extraction of seedling was obtained by detecting the pressure change of <b>the</b> <b>seedling</b> pushing mechanism by pressure sensor. <b>The</b> potted vegetable <b>seedling</b> is taken out from <b>the</b> <b>seedling</b> tray and conveyed to the conveying mechanism. The CCD camera is arranged above the conveying track of the cup to monitor the leakage and load status of <b>the</b> potted vegetable <b>seedling</b> in <b>the</b> cups and to obtain the conveying information.|$|R

In the LF added treatments, K was {{highest in the}} currently adopted 0 % biochar[*]+[*]N-P-K-Mg treatment (0.71 % in <b>the</b> <b>seedling</b> and 1.20 % in the scion).

5|$|Occurring {{in spring}} (August to October), {{the bright red}} or orange-red inflorescences are {{terminal}} and well displayed, and consist of anywhere from 10 to 52 individual flowers split into smaller groups of 2 to 20 flowers, arranged in a corymb. The flowers sit atop stalks (known as pedicels) up to 3.5cm (1.6in) in length, which arise in pairs off main horizontal stalks within the inflorescence. Each flower consists of a tubular perianth up to 4cm (1.8in) long, which partly splits along one side at anthesis to release the thick style. The stigma is contained within a slanting disc-like structure {{at the tip of}} the style. The tubular perianth splits into four segments at its tip, and the anther lies in the concave parts within each of these segments. The pedicel and the outer surface of the perianth are pubescent (covered in short fine fur). Flowers are followed by woody rectangular seed pods that sit on long stalks, and are 7–10cm (2.8–4in) long. Each pod contains 8 to 10seeds, and is ripe in February and March. Each seed is separated from the others by a membranous separator, and has a long rectangular wing, which is much longer than the seed itself. <b>The</b> <b>seedlings</b> have obovate cotyledons that are 0.8–1cm (0.3–0.4in) wide by 1cm (0.4in) long.|$|E
5|$|Often farmers {{would leave}} a solitary cabbage tree—or even groves of trees—standing after the swamps were drained. Most of these trees will slowly die out because {{livestock}} eat <b>the</b> <b>seedlings</b> and damage the trunks and roots of adult trees. When a cabbage tree {{is the only}} shade in a field, stock will shelter underneath it, damaging the bark by rubbing against it, and compacting the soil around the tree. Cows, sheep, goats, and deer eat the nutritious tissue under the bark of cabbage trees. Once the trunk has been damaged by animals, it seldom heals and the wounds get bigger over time. Eventually the tissue in {{the centre of the}} stem rots away and a cavity forms along its entire length. The trunk becomes misshapen or completely ring-barked for a metre above the ground. Often the growth layer dies and the injuries may lead to bacterial or fungal infections that spread into the branches until the canopy too begins to die. Other factors thought to contribute to Rural Decline include wood-rotting fungi like Phanerochaete cordylines, micro-organisms which cause saprobic decay and leaf-feeding caterpillars.|$|E

25|$|Strict categorization, however, is not {{possible}} for some complex species interactions. For example, seed germination and survival in harsh environments is often higher under so-called nurse plants than on open ground.

25|$|In 1881, Charles Darwin {{and his son}} Francis {{performed}} {{experiments on}} coleoptiles, the sheaths enclosing young leaves in germinating grass seedlings. The experiment exposed the coleoptile to light from a unidirectional source, and observed that they bend towards the light. By covering {{various parts of the}} coleoptiles with a light-impermeable opaque cap, the Darwins discovered that light is detected by the coleoptile tip, but that bending occurs in the hypocotyl. However <b>the</b> <b>seedlings</b> showed no signs of development towards light if the tip was covered with an opaque cap, or if the tip was removed. The Darwins concluded that the tip of the coleoptile was responsible for sensing light, and proposed that a messenger is transmitted in a downward direction from the tip of the coleoptile, causing it to bend.|$|E
25|$|Since most {{conifers}} are evergreens, {{the leaves}} of many conifers are long, thin and have a needle-like appearance, but others, including most of the Cupressaceae {{and some of the}} Podocarpaceae, have flat, triangular scale-like leaves. Some, notably Agathis in Araucariaceae and Nageia in Podocarpaceae, have broad, flat strap-shaped leaves. Others such as Araucaria columnaris have leaves that are awl-shaped. In the majority of conifers, the leaves are arranged spirally, exceptions being most of Cupressaceae and one genus in Podocarpaceae, where they are arranged in decussate opposite pairs or whorls of 3 (-4). In many species with spirally arranged leaves, such as Abies grandis (pictured), the leaf bases are twisted to present the leaves in a very flat plane for maximum light capture. Leaf size varies from 2mm in many scale-leaved species, up to 400mm long in the needles of some pines (e.g. Apache Pine, Pinus engelmannii). The stomata are in lines or patches on the leaves, and can be closed when it is very dry or cold. The leaves are often dark green in colour, which may help absorb a maximum of energy from weak sunshine at high latitudes or under forest canopy shade. Conifers from hotter areas with high sunlight levels (e.g. Turkish Pine Pinus brutia) often have yellower-green leaves, while others (e.g. blue spruce, Picea pungens) have a very strong glaucous wax bloom to reflect ultraviolet light. In the great majority of genera the leaves are evergreen, usually remaining on the plant for several (2-40) years before falling, but five genera (Larix, Pseudolarix, Glyptostrobus, Metasequoia and Taxodium) are deciduous, shedding the leaves in autumn and leafless through the winter. <b>The</b> <b>seedlings</b> of many conifers, including most of the Cupressaceae, and Pinus in Pinaceae, have a distinct juvenile foliage period where the leaves are different, often markedly so, from the typical adult leaves.|$|E
