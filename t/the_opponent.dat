5|$|Win on time: In {{games with}} a time control, a player wins if <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> runs out of time, even if <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> has a much {{superior}} position, {{as long as the}} player still has a theoretical possibility to checkmate <b>the</b> <b>opponent.</b>|$|E
5|$|Team Deathmatch: Up to {{four teams}} compete to out-kill <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> teams.|$|E
5|$|Aikido—usually {{translated}} as the Way of Unifying Spirit or the Way of Spiritual Harmony—is a fighting system {{that focuses on}} throws, pins and joint locks together with some striking techniques. It emphasises protecting <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> and promotes spiritual and social development.|$|E
50|$|The wrestler applies an {{inverted}} facelock to a seated opponent and places his far leg between <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> legs and pushes his near leg's knee against <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> back. <b>The</b> wrestler then pulls <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> head backwards {{with their arms}} and <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> far leg outwards with their leg.|$|R
50|$|The wrestler {{stands behind}} his {{opponent}} and bends him backwards. The wrestler tucks <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> head face-up under his armpit, and wraps {{his arm around}} the head so that his forearm is pressed {{against the back of}} <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> neck. <b>The</b> wrestler then pulls <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> head backwards and up, wrenching <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> neck.|$|R
5000|$|Short for [...] "stepover toehold facelock". This hold is {{performed}} on an opponent who is lying {{face down on}} the mat. A wrestler grabs one of <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> legs, and places <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> ankle between their thighs. The wrestler then lies on top of <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> back and locks his arms around <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> head. <b>The</b> wrestler then pulls back stretching <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> back, neck, and knee. The move was innovated by Lou Thesz and popularized by Masahiro Chono, and John Cena.|$|R
5|$|Control of the center: Control of {{the central}} squares allows pieces to be moved to {{any part of the}} board {{relatively}} easily, and can also have a cramping effect on <b>the</b> <b>opponent.</b>|$|E
5|$|Draw on time: In {{games with}} a time control, the game is drawn if a player is out of time and <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> has no {{theoretical}} possibility to checkmate the player.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} Final Fight, Poison and Roxy both utilized standing and acrobatic flip kicks {{to attack the}} player. As one of the fighters in Final Fight Revenge, her moveset was expanded heavily, and she was armed with a whip. The whip is used primarily in her Cat Claw and Thunder Whip attacks (which are comparable to Shoryuken/Shinryūken styled attacks, respectively), {{and can be used}} to steal a weapon from <b>the</b> <b>opponent.</b> Additionally, her handcuffs can be thrown as a horizontal projectile move to immobilize <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> for a short time.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{known as}} a [...] "buffalo sleeper", this choke sees the wrestler {{kneeling}} behind a seated opponent before grabbing hold of one of <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> arms, bending it backwards overhead, and locking <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> wrist into <b>the</b> attacker's armpit. The wrestler then wraps his free arm under <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> chin, like in a sleeper hold, puts his other arm through the arch created by <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> trapped arm, and locks his hands. He then squeezes <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> neck, causing pressure. The move was innovated by Hiroyoshi Tenzan.|$|R
5000|$|A correct clinch also {{involves}} the fighter's forearms pressing against <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> collar bone while the hands are around <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> head rather than <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> neck. <b>The</b> general {{way to get}} out of a clinch is to push <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> head backward or elbow them, as the clinch requires both participants to be very close to one another. Additionally, the non-dominant clincher can try to [...] "swim" [...] their arm underneath and inside <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> clinch, establishing <b>the</b> previously non-dominant clincher as the dominant clincher.|$|R
50|$|The wrestler grabs one of <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> arms, {{jumps and}} connects both their knees against <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> {{stretched}} arm. As the wrestler falls onto their back they forces <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> arm down into both knees, thus damaging it.|$|R
5|$|One more rivalry {{from the}} Raw brand was between John Cena and JBL. In the Fatal Four-Way Elimination match at Backlash, Cena {{eliminated}} JBL by making him {{submit to the}} STFU, a move in which the wrestler wraps his arm {{around the neck of}} <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> in a sleeper hold instead of pulling back on the head of <b>the</b> <b>opponent.</b> On the April 28 episode of Raw, JBL challenged Cena to a singles match at Judgment Day, which was made official on WWE's website.|$|E
5|$|One {{particular}} FFR attack, Poison Kiss, has her blow a large heart-shaped kiss at <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> that {{travels in}} a sine wave path. If it connects, a quick peep show of Poison in several erotic poses is displayed, and afterwards <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> is shown stunned with hearts dancing over their head. Defeating an opponent with this attack results in Poison doing a pole dance for her win pose, with her whip {{serving as the}} pole. Though not playable in the beta test of Capcom Fighting All Stars, promotional material released by Capcom for the title show that this move would have been retained for her gameplay. However, in Ultra Street Fighter IV, her Poison Kiss follows up with several slaps and a groin kick when it hits <b>the</b> <b>opponent,</b> similar to her Cross Art move from Street Fighter X Tekken.|$|E
5|$|Rufus's {{gameplay}} {{has been}} compared to the fighting styles used by Street Fighter III characters Yun and Yang by the development team, notably in regards to his diving kick attack, and emphasized mobility while attacking. Other attacks were designed as a means to negate enemy offensives, such as the Galactic Tornado, which destroys enemy projectiles while drawing <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> closer to Rufus for a final strike. His Ultra Combo, Space Opera Symphony, is a barrage of attacks that requires close proximity to <b>the</b> <b>opponent,</b> dealing several blows and ending in a final upwards blast.|$|E

5000|$|To capture all <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> pieces, or {{to block}} <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> pieces {{so that they}} cannot move.|$|R
5000|$|No, {{when the}} {{attempted}} move is illegal, given <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> position. For example: moving the king into check; moving a queen, rook, bishop, or pawn through squares occupied by <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> pieces; advancing a pawn into a square occupied by <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> pieces.|$|R
5|$|The attacking {{player has}} the initiative, {{he is the}} one who {{controls}} the board, while <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> is left to react. This has also important consequences for the other board.|$|E
5|$|The {{precepts of}} Ahimsa under Hinduism require that war must be avoided, with sincere and truthful dialogue. Force {{must be the}} last resort. If war becomes necessary, its cause must be just, its purpose virtuous, its {{objective}} to restrain the wicked, its aim peace, its method lawful. War can only be started and stopped by a legitimate authority. Weapons used must be proportionate to <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> and the aim of war, not indiscriminate tools of destruction. All strategies and weapons used in the war must be to defeat <b>the</b> <b>opponent,</b> not designed to cause misery to the opponent; for example, use of arrows is allowed, but use of arrows smeared with painful poison is not allowed. Warriors must use judgment in the battlefield. Cruelty to <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> during war is forbidden. Wounded, unarmed opponent warriors must not be attacked or killed, they must be brought to your realm and given medical treatment. Children, women and civilians must not be injured. While the war is in progress, sincere dialogue for peace must continue.|$|E
5|$|These {{moves are}} {{designed}} to be used in flurry combinations. For instance, the player can Seismic Slam an opponent, which pulls in enemies, and progress into a Rising Uppercut, which tosses <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> into the air. During that toss, the player can charge the Rocket Punch and release as <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> returns to the ground. Alternatively, the player can launch into the air, pick an opponent to slam, and punch them at close range. The character is built for aggressive playstyles and advanced players.|$|E
50|$|The attacker's {{right arm}} encircles <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> neck, with <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> trachea at <b>the</b> crook of the elbow.|$|R
50|$|Grabbing <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> mawashi while {{pulling out}} and down, forcing <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> knees to <b>the</b> dohyō (forward force down).|$|R
5000|$|Attacking {{more than}} once while holding <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> kicking leg, or while holding <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> neck with both hands ...|$|R
5|$|Both {{the player}} and <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> have stamina meters, both {{displayed}} {{on the top of}} the screen. The meters decrease when either boxer gets hit by a punch. Boxers will get knocked down if their stamina meter runs out. Faster knockdowns will cause that boxer to recover less stamina upon getting up; the same happens if a boxer is knocked down by a knockout punch. Either boxer will lose if they cannot stand up before the count of ten after being knocked down (resulting in a knockout or KO) or if they are knocked down three times in the match (resulting in a technical knockout or TKO). The player can also recover some stamina while <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> is down by pressing the buttons on the controller.|$|E
5|$|Designed as {{a weapon}} with the longest reach in Soulcalibur, Ivy's sword Valentine {{consists}} of several smaller blades linked together by a chain, able to take either broadsword or chain whip forms. These forms are represented by different stances Ivy can use in the series, altering many of her attacks for each and applying different uses to either form of the weapon, with some, such as Spiral Lust, a component of an existing attack. In addition to these the sword can also have the segments be split apart, in which case they will attack <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> in different ways before recombining on the sword's chain. Due to her variety, Ivy has been noted as being able to attack from any range, however she has also been described as difficult to properly use unless utilizing a range <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> is weakest at. However, attacks such as Ivy Brambler allow her greater variety in range, and allow for chaining into other attacks upon a successful strike. Other attacks, such as Summoning Suffering and Calamity Symphony, involve grappling with <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> to damage them, though utilize complex controller inputs that require them to be utilized in tandem with other moves. With the Xbox Live release of Soulcalibur, due to its complexity the former was utilized for an achievement.|$|E
5|$|In Star Wars: Jedi Arena, two Jedi Knights, one {{blue and}} one red, {{face each other}} during lightsaber training. Player one is blue; the red Jedi is either a human- or {{computer-controlled}} opponent. The player controls his or her lightsaber with the paddle controller, defending oneself from the laser blasts coming from the Seeker ball, fired by <b>the</b> <b>opponent.</b> The Seeker will regularly turn wild and fire laser blasts randomly. The objective {{of the game is}} to fire laser blasts from the Seeker at the opponent's shield and finally directly at <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> by aiming in the direction that the lightsaber is pointing. The game has four difficulty levels, changing the Seeker's speed; on the highest level, the Seeker is invisible. The game ends when one player has received three direct hits, and the winner becomes a Jedi Master.|$|E
50|$|Wrapping {{two hands}} around <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> arm, both {{grasping}} <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> shoulder and forcing him down (under-shoulder swing down).|$|R
5000|$|Also {{known as}} a [...] "cobra twist", this hold begins with a wrestler facing his <b>opponent's</b> side. <b>The</b> wrestler first {{straddles}} one of <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> legs, then reaches over <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> near arm with the arm close to <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> back and locks it. Squatting and twisting to the side, flexes <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> back and stretches their abdomen. This move can also be applied to a seated <b>opponent.</b> <b>The</b> amateur wrestling analogue is the guillotine also {{known as a}} [...] "twister".|$|R
50|$|Many Judo throws lead {{naturally}} to Kesa-Gatame, since the classic judo hold places one grip on <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> lapel and one grip near <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> elbow. Then as one enters the ground phase, one arm goes around <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> neck and <b>the</b> other arm secures <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> arm. In <b>The</b> Canon Of Judo, Kyuzo Mifune {{points out that}} tori's arm should lift uke's head and tori's leg should be under uke's shoulder.|$|R
5|$|Marseille {{attacked}} {{under conditions}} many considered unfavourable, but his marksmanship {{allowed him to}} make an approach fast enough to escape the return fire of the two aircraft flying on either flank of the target. Marseille's excellent eyesight {{made it possible for}} him to spot <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> before he was spotted, allowing him to take the appropriate action and manoeuvre into position for an attack.|$|E
5|$|Reptile's Fatalities in Mortal Kombat II {{consist of}} {{revealing}} his reptilian face {{in order to}} devour the opponent's head, or turning invisible and severing the opponent's torso. Later finishing moves expand upon the concept, ranging from regurgitating acid upon <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> to leaping upon their body and gnawing the flesh from their skulls. In a series retrospective, the Mortal Kombat development team named Reptile's finishers as some of their favorites from the series.|$|E
5|$|Star Wars: Jedi Arena is a 2D {{overhead}} shooter {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Parker Brothers in 1983 for the Atari 2600. It is the first Star Wars video game to feature lightsaber action. The goal of the game, based on one scene in the original Star Wars film, is to take out <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> with the Seeker ball while defending oneself from incoming laser blasts using one's lightsaber.|$|E

50|$|The wrestler places {{both his}} hands behind <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> head, and then falls into a seated position, {{slamming}} <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> face into <b>the</b> canvas. Another variation sees the wrestler placing one hand behind <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> head, and another behind the back and then falling backwards into a bulldog.|$|R
