5|$|The classic {{point in}} polygon test from {{computational}} geometry applies the above ideas. To {{determine if a}} point lies within a polygon, one casts a ray from infinity to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> and counts {{the number of times}} the ray crosses the edge of polygon. The crossing number is even if and only if <b>the</b> <b>point</b> is outside the polygon. This algorithm works because if the ray never crosses the polygon, then its crossing number is zero, which is even, and <b>the</b> <b>point</b> is outside. Every time the ray does cross the polygon, the crossing number alternates between even and odd, and <b>the</b> <b>point</b> at its tip alternates between outside and inside.|$|E

From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for photosynthesis.|$|E
