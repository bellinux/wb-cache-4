5|$|At Potsdam, Truman {{agreed to}} a request from Winston Churchill <b>that</b> <b>Britain</b> be {{represented}} when the atomic bomb was dropped. William Penney and Group Captain Leonard Cheshire were sent to Tinian, but found that LeMay would not let them accompany the mission. All they could do was send a strongly worded signal back to Wilson.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, {{following}} the 1938 Munich Agreement and Hitler's subsequent invasion of Czechoslovakia, Stalin believed <b>that</b> <b>Britain</b> and France {{would not be}} reliable allies against German expansion so instead sought to conciliate Nazi Germany. In May 1939 Maxim Litvinov, the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, was dismissed; Molotov was appointed to succeed him. Molotov was succeeded in his post as Premier by Stalin.|$|E
5|$|In December 1941, Japan launched, {{in quick}} succession, attacks on British Malaya, the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, and Hong Kong. Churchill's {{reaction}} to the entry of the United States into the war was <b>that</b> <b>Britain</b> was now assured of victory {{and the future of}} the empire was safe, but the manner in which British forces were rapidly defeated in the Far East irreversibly harmed Britain's standing and prestige as an imperial power. Most damaging of all was the Fall of Singapore, which had previously been hailed as an impregnable fortress and the eastern equivalent of Gibraltar. The realisation <b>that</b> <b>Britain</b> could not defend its entire empire pushed Australia and New Zealand, which now appeared threatened by Japanese forces, into closer ties with the United States. This resulted in the 1951 ANZUS Pact between Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Bahrain was invaded {{by both the}} Omanis and the Al Sauds. In 1802 it was governed by a 12-year-old child, when the Omani ruler Sayyid Sultan {{installed}} his son, Salim, as Governor in the Arad Fort. In 1816, the British political resident in the Gulf, William Bruce, {{received a letter from}} the Sheikh of Bahrain who was concerned about a rumour <b>that</b> <b>Britain</b> would support an attack on the island by the Imam of Muscat. He sailed to Bahrain to reassure the Sheikh that {{this was not the case}} and drew up an informal agreement assuring the Sheikh <b>that</b> <b>Britain</b> would remain a neutral party.|$|E
5|$|The British Army during World War I was {{the largest}} {{military}} force <b>that</b> <b>Britain</b> had put into the field up to that point.

5|$|The {{ostensible}} reason given was <b>that</b> <b>Britain</b> {{was required}} to safeguard Belgium's neutrality under the 1839 Treaty of London. The German invasion of Belgium was, therefore, the casus belli and, importantly, legitimized and galvanized popular support for the war.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the series}} fictionalises {{the world of}} MI5, several storylines are based on truth. The series had advisors who were ex-MI5 officers. The writers also {{research}} heavily on each episode. The producers were keen in world events <b>that</b> <b>Britain</b> and America were directly or indirectly responsible for, where the consequences of an operation are worse than what they intended to resolve in the first place, known as blowback. One example includes the two powers aiding the Afghan Mujahideen in 1989 before {{pulling out of the}} country; this ultimately lead to the rise of Al-Qaeda.|$|E

In addition to the production of alkali, his factories were making other chemicals for use as explosives. He also built a new factory to purify trinitrotoluene.|$|E

5|$|British consuls in the United States {{sought to}} enlist Americans for the Crimean War in 1854, in {{violation}} of neutrality laws, and Pierce eventually expelled minister Crampton and three consuls. To the President's surprise, the British did not expel Buchanan in retaliation. In his December 1855 message to Congress Pierce had set forth the American case <b>that</b> <b>Britain</b> had violated the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty. The British, according to Buchanan, were impressed by the message and were rethinking their policy. Nevertheless, Buchanan was not successful in getting the British to renounce their Central American possessions. The Canadian treaty was ratified by Congress, the British Parliament, and by the colonial legislatures in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Calgacus' fate {{is unknown}} but, {{according}} to Tacitus, {{after the battle}} Agricola ordered the prefect of the fleet to sail around the north of Scotland to confirm <b>that</b> <b>Britain</b> was an island and to receive the surrender of the Orcadians. It was proclaimed that Agricola had finally subdued all the tribes of Britain. However, the Roman historian Cassius Dio reports that this circumnavigation resulted in Titus receiving his 15th acclamation as emperor in 79. This is five years before Mons Graupius is believed by most historians to have taken place.|$|E
5|$|Discussions about patrols {{remained}} complicated. Britain and France {{offered to}} replace Germany and Italy in patrols of their sections, but the latter powers believed these patrols {{would be too}} partial. Germany and Italy requested that land controls be kept, and belligerent rights {{be given to the}} Nationalists, so that rights of search could be used by both the Republicans and Nationalists to replace naval patrols. The French considered abandoning border controls, or perhaps leaving non-intervention. However, the French were reliant on the British, who wished to continue with patrols. Britain and France thus continued to labour over non-intervention; whilst they judged it effective, some 42 ships were estimated to have escaped inspection between April and the end of July. The air route had not been covered. The Nationalists' debt to Germany reached 150 million Reichmarks. On 9 July, the Dutch Ambassador suggested <b>that</b> <b>Britain</b> draft a compromise. Lord Plymouth did, called the 'compromise plan for the control of non-intervention'. Naval patrols would be replaced by observers in ports and ships, land control measures would be resumed. Belligerent rights would only be granted when substantial progress was made on volunteer withdrawal. The French were furious, considering <b>that</b> <b>Britain</b> was moving towards Germany and Italy. Grandi demanded the discussion of belligerent rights before volunteer rights; Maisky insisted that volunteers be discussed first.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, Britain had {{a nuclear}} weapons project, codenamed Tube Alloys, which was merged with the American Manhattan Project in August 1943. Many of Britain's top {{scientists}} participated in the British contribution to the Manhattan Project. After the war, fearing <b>that</b> <b>Britain</b> would lose its great power status, the British government resumed the atomic bomb development effort, now codenamed High Explosive Research. The successful test of an atomic bomb in Operation Hurricane in October 1952 represented an extraordinary scientific and technological achievement, but Britain was still several years behind the United States in nuclear weapons technology. In July 1954, Cabinet decided to develop the hydrogen bomb.|$|E
5|$|For many at the indaba, {{the most}} {{pressing}} motivator was Matabeleland's security. While Lobengula considered the Transvaalers more formidable battlefield adversaries than the British, he understood <b>that</b> <b>Britain</b> was more prominent on the world stage, and while the Boers wanted land, Rudd's party claimed to be interested only in mining and trading. Lobengula reasoned that if he accepted Rudd's proposals, he would keep his land, and the British would be obliged {{to protect him from}} incursions by the Boers.|$|E
5|$|From a {{historical}} perspective Britain’s situation was likened to that which the Austrian Empire found itself in after it was defeated by the Kingdom of Prussia in the Battle of Königgrätz in 1866. As Austria was thereafter formally excluded from German affairs, so too would Britain be excluded from continental affairs {{in the event of}} a German victory. Yet afterwards, Austria-Hungary became a loyal ally of the German Empire in the pre-World War I power alignments in Europe, and it was hoped <b>that</b> <b>Britain</b> would come to fulfill this same role.|$|E

5|$|High Explosive Research was the British {{project to}} {{independently}} develop atomic bombs after the Second World War. This decision {{was taken by}} a cabinet sub-committee on 8 January 1947, in response to apprehension of an American return to isolationism, fears <b>that</b> <b>Britain</b> might lose its great power status, and the actions by the United States to unilaterally withdraw from sharing of nuclear technology under the 1943 Quebec Agreement. The decision was publicly announced in the House of Commons on 12 May 1948.|$|E
5|$|In 1845, the Senate {{took up the}} {{question}} of ending the joint occupancy of the Oregon Territory with Great Britain. Lewis Cass, a senator from Michigan, supported an immediate termination of the joint occupation agreement and maintained that a war with the British over the matter was inevitable. Crittenden disagreed, and insisted <b>that</b> <b>Britain</b> be given two years notice before the joint occupation of the territory was ended {{in order to allow}} time for a diplomatic resolution. Ultimately, Crittenden's position prevailed, and a compromise with Britain was effected, setting the dividing line between the two nations' claims at the 49th parallel north.|$|E
5|$|In January 1727, Spain {{declared}} the nullification of the Treaty of Utrecht's provisions relating to Gibraltar {{on the grounds}} <b>that</b> <b>Britain</b> had violated its terms by extending Gibraltar's fortifications beyond the permitted limits, allowing Jews and Moors to live there, failing to protect Catholics and harming Spain's revenues by allowing smuggling. Spanish forces began a siege and bombardment of Gibraltar the following month, causing severe damage through intensive cannon fire. The defenders withstood the threat and were reinforced and resupplied by a British naval force. Bad weather and supply problems caused the Spanish to call off the siege {{at the end of}} June.|$|E
