5|$|In {{order to}} further enhance the appeal of its new {{flagship}} product, in 1993 the firm established a Communication Services division, designed {{to tap into the}} commercial market. The firm started making deals with major telecommunication companies, such as BellSouth and MCI Inc. in preparation for the services the firm was about to offer. In November of that year the division launched its Fax Broadcast service. <b>The</b> <b>Fax</b> Broadcast service allowed subscribers to upload a single fax and a recipient list to Delrina. Systems at Delrina would then send out <b>the</b> <b>fax</b> to the recipients on that list, to a maximum of 500 fax numbers. A subsequent Fax Mailbox feature—which enabled subscribers to remotely access both fax and voice messages from a single phone number—was initially held up following a dispute with AlphaNet Telecom for the rights to the technology. This dispute was resolved by June 1994, though with both sides publicly disputing the story of the other, and with AlphaNet receiving an undisclosed sum in compensation.|$|E
5|$|By late 1994 {{the firm}} was {{considered}} one of the fastest-growing software companies in North America, and employed over 500 people, most located at its offices in Toronto. The firm's financial situation improved greatly, and by February 1995 Delrina was reported to have captured almost three-quarters of <b>the</b> <b>fax</b> software market, was debt-free and had $40 million in the bank. The firm was shipping 200,000 units of WinFax a month, and had an installed base of four million users. The cost of doing business had also improved, as the firm's cost of sales was now 25% of net sales, down from 30% the previous fiscal year, improving the firm's gross profits.|$|E

25|$|The rumor {{once again}} spread in October 1998, {{when a new}} fax, this time {{claiming}} to originate with a Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE) officer in Texas. The rumor spread further when officials in the San Diego government circulated <b>the</b> <b>fax</b> among city agencies; this version of <b>the</b> <b>fax,</b> though quickly dismissed within city government when {{it was found that}} the Sheriff's office had no real connection to it, now appeared to be a legitimate government-issued document. Also in the fall of 1998, the Sheriff's office of Nassau County, Florida sent a warning about such gang initiation to the county fire department, who subsequently spread <b>the</b> <b>fax</b> to all county agencies. Police dispatcher Ann Johnson had thought the message urgent enough to send, but had not bothered to check its legitimacy.|$|E

25|$|There {{was another}} effort to remove Moscoe as chair late in 1999, {{when it was}} {{revealed}} that an employee in his office had faxed confidential documents to a company suing the TTC. Moscoe indicated that he had no awareness of <b>the</b> <b>fax,</b> but submitted a resignation notice to take formal responsibility. The other commissioners planned to reject his resignation after a single day's debate, but commissioner Rob Davis unexpectedly suspended the proceedings and suggested that a broader inquiry be launched. Moscoe then withdrew his resignation, saying that the matter should have been resolved quickly to permit the TTC to return to its regular business. There was a further attempt to dismiss Moscoe in January 2000, but this came to nothing.|$|E
50|$|A {{transmitting}} {{subscriber identification}} (abbreviated TSID) is a string that identifies a specific <b>fax</b> machine as <b>the</b> sender of a <b>fax</b> transmission. <b>The</b> transmitting machine sends its TSID to the receiving machine.

500|$|To {{show the}} side effects Focusyn had on Bart, the animators made slight changes to his face as the episode progressed. It is first seen in the scene where Bart is reading [...] "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Pre-teens": a cheek line is added just under his eyes {{to suggest that he}} is {{starting}} to change. In another scene, Bart can be seen speed reading and later on, the animators drew him with [...] "mini-pupils". The staff discussed whether Bart's pupils would be bigger or smaller than normal while he is on the drug. The writers settled on smaller pupils and, according to Kirkland, [...] "several model sheets were going back and forth over <b>the</b> <b>fax</b> machines" [...] until the staff were satisfied with the size of Bart's pupils while influenced by the drug. In fact, psychostimulants used to treat ADHD are more likely cause pupils to become bigger (dilated).|$|E
500|$|In a {{deliberate}} attempt to diversify the business, The Company chose {{to move into}} <b>the</b> <b>fax</b> software market with its WinFax product. Software developer Tony Davis (another South African expatriate who had moved to Canada) was initially hired {{as a consultant to}} work on the forms line of products in the late 1980s, soon afterwards becoming part of that team. In his spare time he developed a prototype of what would become the first WinFax product, with the agreement that Delrina would be its publisher. In 1990 Delrina devoted a relatively small space to this new product at that year's COMDEX (a computer trade show), under a sign that said simply: [...] "Send a Fax from Your PC". It garnered the most attention of any Delrina product being demonstrated at that show. This interest convinced the founding partners of the commercial viability of the product. Tony Davis went on to sell his product idea to Delrina, and stayed on as its lead software architect and designer.|$|E
50|$|According to unnamed US {{government}} officials, {{beginning in}} early 2011 <b>the</b> US would <b>fax</b> notifications to Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency (ISI) detailing the dates and general areas of future drone attack operations. The ISI {{would send a}} return fax acknowledging receipt, but not approving the operation. Nevertheless, it appeared that Pakistan would clear the airspace over the area and on the dates designated in <b>the</b> US <b>fax.</b> After <b>the</b> May 2011 raid that killed bin Laden, the ISI ceased acknowledging <b>the</b> US <b>faxes,</b> but Pakistani authorities have appeared to continue clearing the airspace in the areas where US drones are operating.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>faxes</b> sent and {{received}} during one week {{by a small}} Finnish company involved in international operations were analyzed {{to determine whether or}} not <b>the</b> business <b>fax</b> contains distinct features that warrant classifying it as a genre. Using a framework of critical discourse analysis, the study looked at a total of 69 <b>faxes.</b> <b>The</b> results suggest that <b>the</b> business <b>fax</b> is a distinct, dynamic genre that is constituted by and constitutive of the social practices within which it is situated. Five specific subgenres of <b>the</b> business <b>fax</b> &mdash; identified as specific information, specific requests, "for your information, " first contact, and order &mdash; were also found. Some implications of English being used as the common language for faxes are also considered. Communicating in business has changed dramatically in the pasttwo decades. The new communication media (computers, faxes, e-mail, voice mail) have affected the entire communication process: who communicates with whom, when, in what language, with what style, and through which channel. This is particularly true of inter-national business where fax and e-mail reduce the impact of time zon...|$|R

500|$|Levels were {{designed}} {{based on a}} Deluxe Paint interface, which allowed several of the members to design levels, resulting in [...] "hundreds of levels". There were several internal iterations of the levels, each designer challenging the others. Dailly pointed out that David Jones [...] "used to try and beat us, and after proudly stabbing a finger at the screen and saying 'There! Beat that!', we'd calmly point out a totally new way of getting around all his traps, and {{doing it in a}} much simpler method. 'Oh...', he'd mutter, and scramble off to try and fix it." [...] They also sent internally tested levels to Psygnosis, getting back the results of their testing via fax. While most were solved quickly, Dailly commented that [...] "Every now and again though, <b>the</b> <b>fax</b> would be covered in scribbles with the time and comments crossed out again and again; this is what we were striving for while we were designing the levels, and it gave us all a warm fuzzy feeling inside." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{started a}} new mythology for the series {{questioning}} the origin of human life. Series creator Chris Carter claimed {{to be interested in}} the subject for a while, citing the possibility of extraterrestrial involvement in great extinctions that had happened millions of years ago. Carter claimed that early in the show he had met with a man {{who was one of the}} people responsible for leading the project of mapping the human genome and that he was interested enough in the subject to tie it into the show's alien mythology. The scientific basis for extraterrestrials persuaded the writers to help Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully's (Gillian Anderson) beliefs come together, which was furthered in the later seasons of the show. Frank Spotnitz claimed that the ideas used in this episode had been discussed between him and Carter for a few years, and had become easier to bring up after clearing away elements of the conspiracy in the episodes [...] "Two Fathers" [...] and [...] "One Son". Carter developed the script in Vancouver, Canada while working on the pilot for his series Harsh Realm, providing pages to the production crew via <b>the</b> <b>fax</b> machine.|$|E
500|$|The {{rapid growth}} in sales of this product was unexpected, with Bennie quoted in an {{interview}} from late 1993 as saying [...] "the success of WinFax really caught us by surprise". With {{the success of the}} WinFax product, the company grew rapidly. By early 1993 the number of employees had grown to 250, {{and by the end of}} the year to 350. The increasing success of the WinFax product consequently led to significant strains on the firm to handle the increasing volume of calls to its Technical Support department, as each of the over 300 modems on the market at the time had their own nuances in how they implemented <b>the</b> <b>fax</b> data standard. Delrina spent roughly $800,000 in an improved telephone infrastructure in an attempt to get wait times to under five minutes. In December 1993 Delrina hired 40 additional people to help alleviate the growing number of calls to the firm for technical support. By the end of 1994 the situation had improved to the point where noted industry commentator Robert X. Cringely put Delrina in his shortlist of firms providing [...] "exceptional" [...] product support.|$|E

2500|$|By late 2000, Shaik {{knew that}} the South African Revenue Service (SARS) and the Scorpions would be {{watching}} all financial transactions made between him and Zuma, so the international division of Thomson-CSF sent an encrypted fax to Nkobi Holdings detailing a “service provider agreement" [...] which updated the contract signed between Nkobi Holdings and Thomson-CSF for the delivery of the Corvettes. This agreement was used to disguise the payment of the bribe. <b>The</b> <b>fax,</b> which was later obtained in a raid on Shaik’s office by the Scorpions, contained a non-bribery clause next to which Shaik wrote “conflicts with intention", yet despite the careful set-up, Thomson-CSF did not transfer any money to Shaik. Subsequently, Zuma went to meet with Thétard in Paris, following which R250,000 (US$38,000) was transferred by Thomson-CSF to the “Jacob Zuma Education Fund".|$|E
2500|$|On January 11, 1994, General Romeo Dallaire, {{commander}} of UNAMIR, sent his [...] "Genocide Fax" [...] to UN Headquarters. <b>The</b> <b>fax</b> stated that Dallaire was {{in contact with}} a high level informant who told him of plans to distribute weapons to Hutu militias to kill Belgian members of UNAMIR in order to guarantee Belgian withdrawal. The informant, a local politician, had been ordered to register all Tutsis in Kigali with an example that they could kill up to 1,000 Tutsis in 20 minutes, leading to the extermination of the Tutsis. Dallaire requested permission {{for the protection of the}} informant and his family. Kofi Annan repeatedly forbade the operation until guidance was received from headquarters. He did so even as the genocide had started, despite having the authority for approval. His reason for not doing so was Article 2(4) of the Charter, although the intervention would have been by the UN itself, not a member state. The UNAMIR force was established by Resolution 872 on October 5, 1993 with the consent of both parties to the civil war. Thomas Pogge argues that UNAMIR could not have been charged with intervening because both sides requested and consented to it and it was authorized by the UN Security Council.|$|E

60|$|But the plebeians {{were always}} {{trying not to}} be left out of everything. By and by, they said under Servius Tullius, the city was divided into six quarters, and all the {{families}} living in them into six tribes, each of which had a tribune to watch over it, bring up the number of its men, and lead them to battle. Another division of the citizens, both patrician and plebeian, was made every five years. They were all counted and numbered and divided off into centuries according to their wealth. Then these centuries, or hundreds, had votes, by the persons they chose, when {{it was a question of}} peace or war. Their meeting was called the Comitia; but as there were more patrician centuries than plebeian ones, the patricians still had much more power. Besides, the Senate and all the magistrates were in those days always patricians. These magistrates were chosen every year. There were two consuls, who were like kings for the time, only that they wore no crowns; they had purple robes, and sat in chairs ornamented with ivory, and they were always attended by lictors, who carried bundles of rods tied round an axe--the first for scourging, the second for beheading. There were under them two prætors, or judges, who tried offences; two quæstors, who attended to the public buildings; and two censors, who had to look after the numbering and registering of the people in their tribes and centuries. The consuls in general commanded the army, but sometimes, when there was a great need, one single leader was chosen and was called dictator. Sometimes a dictator was chosen merely to fulfil an omen, by driving a nail into the head of the great statue of Jupiter in the Capitol. Besides these, all the priests had to be patricians; the chief of all was called Pontifex Maximus. Some say this was because he was <b>the</b> <b>fax</b> (maker) of pontes (bridges), as he blessed them and decided by omens where they should be; but others think the word was Pompifex, and that he was the maker of pomps or ceremonies. There were many priests as well as augurs, who had to draw omens from the flight of birds or the appearance of sacrifices, and who kept the account of the calendar of lucky and unlucky days, and of festivals.|$|E
