5|$|On {{the first}} centenary of Marie Curie's second Nobel Prize in 2011, an allegorical mural was {{painted on the}} façade of her Warsaw birthplace. It depicts an infant Maria Skłodowska holding a <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> from which emanate the {{elements}} that she would discover as an adult: polonium and radium. Also in 2011, a new Warsaw bridge over the Vistula was named in her honor.|$|E
5|$|Redback {{antivenom}} {{was developed}} by Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, then a government body involved with discovering antivenoms for many venomous Australian creatures. Production involves the milking of venom from redbacks and repeatedly inoculating horses with non-lethal doses. The horse immune systems makes polyclonal antibodies. Blood plasma, containing the antibodies, is extracted by plasmapheresis. The plasma is treated with pepsin, and the active F(ab')2 fragments are separated and purified. Each vial contains 500 units of redback antivenom in approximately 1.5 ml, which is enough to inactivate 5mg of redback spider venom in a <b>test</b> <b>tube.</b> The antivenom has been safely administered to women {{in various stages of}} pregnancy. Redback antivenom has been widely used in Australia since 1956, although evidence from controlled studies for its effectiveness has been lacking. Recent trials show antivenom has a low response rate little better than placebo, and any effect is less than might be achieved with optimal use of standard analgesics. Further studies are needed to confirm or refute its effectiveness. It appears clinically active against arachnidism caused by Steatoda spiders; however, as these cases are often mild and the evidence of its effectiveness is limited, this treatment is not recommended. Similarly, the antivenom has been reported as effective with bites of L. katipo, and L. tredecimguttatus. Animal studies also support its use against envenomation from other widow spiders, having successfully been tested against venom from L. mactans, L. hesperus, and L. tredecimguttatus (synonym L.lugubris).|$|E
25|$|A {{sample of}} the plasma is {{extracted}} from the <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> and placed into a measuring <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> (Note: for an accurate measurement, the ratio of blood to citrate needs to be fixed and should be labeled {{on the side of}} the measuring <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> by the manufacturing company; many laboratories will not perform the assay if the tube is underfilled and contains a relatively high concentration of citrate—the standardized dilution of 1 part anticoagulant to 9 parts whole blood is no longer valid).|$|E
25|$|In {{the context}} of protein purification, the eluent is usually pooled in {{different}} <b>test</b> <b>tubes.</b> All <b>test</b> <b>tubes</b> containing no measurable trace of the protein to purify are discarded. The remaining solution is thus made of the protein to purify and any other similarly-sized proteins.|$|R
30|$|In this assay, the {{reducing}} power capacity was performed {{according to the}} way described by Oyaizu [15]. In different <b>test</b> <b>tubes,</b> 2.0  mL of each seed extracts or standard of different concentration solutions were taken and 2.5  mL of 1 % Potassium ferricyanide (K 3 Fe(CN) 6) solution was added into each of <b>test</b> <b>tubes.</b> The <b>test</b> <b>tubes</b> were incubated for 10  min at 50  °C to complete the reaction and 2.5  mL of Trichloroacetic acid, 10 % solution was added {{to each of the}} <b>test</b> <b>tubes.</b> The total mixtures were centrifuged at 3000  rpm for 10  min. 2.5  mL supernatant solution was withdrawn from each of the mixtures and mixed with 2.5  mL of distilled water. 0.5  mL of 0.1 % Ferric chloride (FeCl 3) solution was added to each of the <b>test</b> <b>tubes.</b> The absorbance of the solutions was measured at 700  nm using a spectrophotometer against distilled water. The absorbance of the blank solution was also measured at 700  nm against the solvent used in solution preparation.|$|R

Ford reportedly convinced Charles Edison to seal a <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> of air in the inventor's room shortly after his death, as a memento. A plaster death mask and casts of Edison's hands were also made. Mina died in 1947.|$|E
25|$|If {{there is}} no {{antibody}} present, an immediate spin crossmatch or computer assisted crossmatch is performed where the recipient serum and donor rbc are incubated. In the immediate spin method, two drops of patient serum are tested against a drop of 3–5% suspension of donor cells in a <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> and spun in a serofuge. Agglutination or hemolysis (i.e., positive Coombs test) in the <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> is a positive reaction and the unit should not be transfused.|$|E

25|$|Blood {{is drawn}} into a <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> {{containing}} liquid sodium citrate, which acts as an anticoagulant by binding the calcium in a sample. The blood is mixed, then centrifuged to separate blood cells from plasma (as prothrombin time is most commonly measured using blood plasma). In newborns, a capillary whole blood specimen is used.|$|E
25|$|Macroscopically, the gas {{characteristics}} measured {{are either}} {{in terms of}} the gas particles themselves (velocity, pressure, or temperature) or their surroundings (volume). For example, Robert Boyle studied pneumatic chemistry for a small portion of his career. One of his experiments related the macroscopic properties of pressure and volume of a gas. His experiment used a J-tube manometer which looks like a <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> {{in the shape of the}} letter J. Boyle trapped an inert gas in the closed end of the <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> with a column of mercury, thereby making the number of particles and the temperature constant. He observed that when the pressure was increased in the gas, by adding more mercury to the column, the trapped gas' volume decreased (this is known as an inverse relationship). Furthermore, when Boyle multiplied the pressure and volume of each observation, the product was constant. This relationship held for every gas that Boyle observed leading to the law, (PV=k), named to honor his work in this field.|$|E
30|$|The surface acidity of the zeolite acid {{activated}} zeolite {{was determined}} by amine adsorption analysis. A {{brief description of the}} method is as follows: a known amount of air dried zeolite or acid activated zeolite (50  mg) were added into a series of <b>test</b> <b>tubes.</b> Subsequently, different volumes (20 – 50  ml) of n-butylamine solution in benzene (0.01  M) were added to the <b>test</b> <b>tubes.</b> The <b>test</b> <b>tubes</b> then tightly stoppered and stores at 30  °C. After the equilibrium condition was achieved, the remaining n-butylamine in the solution {{was determined by}} titration using 0.016  M trichloroacetic acid solution in benzene, and 2, 4 dinitrophenol was used as the indicator.|$|R

50|$|Drying Racks can be {{used for}} various purposes, {{including}} drying and holding chromatography plates, as well as drying <b>test</b> <b>tubes</b> by placing them in an inverted position in the pegs. Placing the <b>test</b> <b>tubes</b> in an inverted position not only aids in drying, but it also minimizes the accumulation of airborne contaminants and other substances.

25|$|There are {{two basic}} molding methods for PET bottles, {{one-step}} and two-step. In two-step molding, two separate machines are used. The first machine injection molds the preform, which resembles a <b>test</b> <b>tube,</b> with the bottle-cap threads already molded into place. The body of the tube is significantly thicker, as it will be inflated into its final shape in the second step using stretch blow molding.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} {{dried plasma}} package came in two tin cans containing 400 cc bottles. One bottle contained enough distilled water to reconstitute the dried plasma {{contained within the}} other bottle. In about three minutes, the plasma {{would be ready to}} use and could stay fresh for around four hours. Dr. Charles R. Drew was appointed medical supervisor, {{and he was able to}} transform the <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> methods into the first successful technique for mass production.|$|E
30|$|In summary, we have {{demonstrated}} successful fabrication of a uniformly distributed array of micro <b>test</b> <b>tubes</b> and microbeakers on p-type Si substrates with tunable dimensions. Iron oxide nanoparticles, with {{average particle size}} approximately 20 nm, synthesized using chemical co-precipitation and exhibiting superparamagnetic characteristics, were attached {{to the surface and}} to the walls of these micro <b>test</b> <b>tubes</b> and microbeakers without completely filling the pores. Such robust and cost-effective SPION attached micro <b>test</b> <b>tubes</b> and microbeakers formed on Si substrates have immense applications in biomedical sensing due to biocompatible nature of both the materials. By loading such SPIONs with designed sequences of DNA at specific ensemble of the nanopores may upgrade the system to a nano-designed array, the specific details of which is presently under progress.|$|R

25|$|Also, the <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> {{confines}} {{motion to}} the direction {{down the length}} of the tube, so vB is opposite to u1 and the Coriolis force is opposite to u2, that is, against the wall of the tube. If the tube is spun for a long enough time, the velocity vB drops to zero as the matter comes to an equilibrium distribution.

25|$|Crusniks are vampires who feed on {{the blood}} of other vampires. They possess immense power and {{destructive}} potential and are nearly invincible. Whereas the Methuselahs are either born or infected, the Crusniks are unique beings created {{as a result of}} an experiment during the Mars Colonization Project. The three Crusniks, Seth, Abel, and Lilith, were <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> babies created for the Mars Colonization Project by the UNASF with genetically enhanced bodies. They were infused with the Crusnik nanomachines that were found on Mars as their enhanced bodies were the only ones capable of surviving the procedure. The exact circumstances behind the infusions of Seth, Abel, and Lilith are unknown, while Cain's infusion was done by Seth to save his life after a fatal accident.|$|E
25|$|Another {{germination}} event {{during the}} life cycle of gymnosperms and flowering plants is the germination of a pollen grain after pollination. Like seeds, pollen grains are severely dehydrated before being released to facilitate their dispersal from one plant to another. They consist of a protective coat containing several cells (up to 8 in gymnosperms, 2-3 in flowering plants). One of these cells is a tube cell. Once the pollen grain lands on the stigma of a receptive flower (or a female cone in gymnosperms), it takes up water and germinates. Pollen germination is facilitated by hydration on the stigma, {{as well as by the}} structure and physiology of the stigma and style. Pollen can also be induced to germinate in vitro (in a petri dish or <b>test</b> <b>tube).</b>|$|E

25|$|Hydrazine sulfate was {{specifically}} {{developed as a}} result of a proposal by Joseph Gold for a therapy that could offset the rapid loss of weight that occurs in cancer (cancer cachexia). This hypothesis was based on the fact that cancer cells are often unusually dependent on glycolysis for energy (the Warburg effect), Gold proposed that the body might offset this increased glycolysis using gluconeogenesis, which is the pathway that is the reverse of glycolysis. Since this process would require a great deal of energy, Gold thought that inhibiting gluconeogenesis might reverse this energy requirement and be an effective treatment for cancer cachexia. Hydrazine is a reactive chemical that in the <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> can inactivate one of the enzymes needed for gluconeogenesis, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEP-CK). It was also postulated that if tumor energy gain (glycolysis) and host-energy loss (gluconeogenesis) were functionally interrelated, inhibition of gluconeogenesis at PEP CK could result in actual tumor regression in addition to reversal or arrest of cancer cachexia. In this model, hydrazine sulfate is therefore thought to act by irreversibly inhibiting the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.|$|E
500|$|Direct {{translation}} from DNA to protein {{has been}} demonstrated in a cell-free system (i.e. in a <b>test</b> <b>tube),</b> using extracts from E. coli that contained ribosomes, but not intact cells. [...] These cell fragments could synthesize proteins from single-stranded DNA templates isolated from other organisms (e,g., mouse or toad), and neomycin was found to enhance this effect. However, {{it was unclear whether}} this mechanism of translation corresponded specifically to the genetic code.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, a {{parasitic}} fly (Apocephalus borealis) larva, {{known to}} prey on bumble bees and wasps, {{was found in}} a <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> containing a dead honey bee believed to have been affected by CCD, [...] possibly indicating the phorid fly may be one cause of CCD. The mature fly lays eggs in the bee's abdomen, which feed on the bee after hatching. Infected bees behave abnormally, foraging at night and gathering around lights like moths. Eventually the bee leaves the colony to die. The phorid fly larvae then emerge from the neck of the bee.|$|E
