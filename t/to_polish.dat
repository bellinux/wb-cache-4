5|$|After the Nihil novi act of 1505, a {{collection}} of laws known as Łaski's Statutes was published in 1506 and distributed <b>to</b> <b>Polish</b> courts. The legal pronouncements, intended to facilitate the functioning of a uniform and centralized state, with ordinary szlachta privileges strongly protected, were frequently ignored by the kings, beginning with Sigismund I, and the upper nobility or church interests. This situation {{became the basis for}} the formation around 1520 of the szlachtas execution movement, for the complete codification and execution, or enforcement, of the laws.|$|E
5|$|Both sides {{suffered}} heavy casualties. The Polish {{casualties were}} particularly severe. In {{a relatively short}} time the Polish Second Army lost more than 22 percent of its personnel and 57 percent of its tanks and armored vehicles (about 200 total). Official estimates claimed about 18,000 casualties (including almost 5,000 dead). Some other estimates give the Polish casualties as up to 25,000.

Today, cerium and its compounds have a variety of uses: for example, cerium(IV) oxide is used <b>to</b> <b>polish</b> glass and is an important part of catalytic converters.

5|$|The Mazurka was {{composed}} in the mid-1870s but not published until 1883. It {{is a tribute}} to Chopin, and contains echoes of the earlier composer's music. Chopin, however, composed more than 60 mazurkas, and Fauré wrote only this one. Morrison regards it as an experiment on Fauré's part. The piece owes little <b>to</b> <b>Polish</b> folk-dance rhythms, and may have had a Russian influence through Fauré's friendship with Sergei Taneyev at around the time of its composition.|$|E
40|$|Skid-resistance of trafficked roads {{decreases}} due <b>to</b> <b>polishing</b> and {{can have}} a drastic consequence on the driver safety. There {{is a need to}} dispose of a laboratory test to forecast such variations on asphalt-mix specimens before the road construction. This paper is focused on the development of a polishing methodology using the so-called Wehner/Schulze machine. Three trafficked roads have been monitored since their construction to provide data on actual friction evolutions. Specimens are taken from the pavements just after the road construction and subjected <b>to</b> <b>polishing</b> tests. The comparison between laboratory evolution curves and road data shows that, after two years of traffic, the polishing procedure is relevant. Tests on aggregates show that the friction variation of the asphalt mix is controlled by the aggregates, once the binder layer is removed by the traffic. Analyses of surface profiles show that the aggregate friction-variation due <b>to</b> <b>polishing</b> action can be explained by a modification of the aggregate microtexture...|$|R

It is possible that the Polish dye was used to manufacture some of the famous oriental rugs.|$|E

5|$|All of Chopin's {{compositions}} {{include the}} piano. Most are for solo piano, though {{he also wrote}} two piano concertos, a few chamber pieces, and some songs <b>to</b> <b>Polish</b> lyrics. His keyboard style is highly individual and often technically demanding; his own performances were noted for their nuance and sensitivity. Chopin invented {{the concept of the}} instrumental ballade. His major piano works also include mazurkas, waltzes, nocturnes, polonaises, études, impromptus, scherzos, preludes and sonatas, some published only after his death. Influences on his composition style include Polish folk music, the classical tradition of J. S. Bach, Mozart and Schubert, as well as the Paris salons where he was a frequent guest. His innovations in style, musical form, and harmony, and his association of music with nationalism, were influential throughout and after the late Romantic period.|$|E

5|$|Although Musique funèbre was internationally acclaimed, his new {{harmonic}} techniques led {{to something}} of a crisis for Lutosławski, during which he still could not see how to express his musical ideas.

Although he was not influenced by the sound or {{the philosophy of the}} music, Cage's explorations of indeterminacy set off a train of thought which resulted in Lutosławski finding a way to retain the harmonic structures he wanted while introducing the freedom for which he was searching. His Three Postludes were hastily rounded off (he had intended to write four) and he moved on to compose works in which he explored these new ideas.|$|E
