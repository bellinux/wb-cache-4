The moult period for Siberian birds is more compressed, running from June to mid-September. Fledged juveniles moult some of their wing coverts when they are about eight weeks old.|$|E

5|$|A {{study from}} 2008 {{indicates}} that sexual dimorphism occurs early during this species' ontogeny. L.canarium males reach sexual maturity at a shorter shell length {{when compared to}} females. Individuals {{are considered to be}} adult by the time the outer lip of their shell is noticeably thickened and flared; growth to adult size <b>takes</b> <b>about</b> a year. The maximum life span of the dog conch differs between sexes; it is estimated at 2 and 2.5 years for females and males, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Charcoal {{can be made}} by slow {{pyrolysis}} of wood by heating it in {{the absence}} of air in a kiln. The carefully stacked branches, often oak, are burned with a very limited amount of air. The process of converting them into charcoal <b>takes</b> <b>about</b> fifteen hours. Charcoal is used as a fuel in barbecues and by blacksmiths and has many industrial and other uses.|$|E

5|$|Chewing lice {{live among}} the hairs or {{feathers}} of their host and feed on skin and debris, while sucking lice pierce the host's skin and feed on blood and other secretions. They usually spend their whole {{life on a}} single host, cementing their eggs, which are known as nits, to hairs or feathers. The eggs hatch into nymphs, which moult three times before becoming fully grown, a process that <b>takes</b> <b>about</b> four weeks.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{seemingly}} {{close proximity to}} its neighbouring communities, a motorized pirogue trip to Carabane from Elinkine, the nearest village, <b>takes</b> <b>about</b> thirty minutes; the trip once took {{an hour and a}} half by canoe. Carabane may also be accessed by a two- or three-hour boat trip from Ziguinchor. Travelling from Cap Skirring via Cachouane is also possible, but as a detailed map of the region would make clear, the channels of salt water are not easily navigated.|$|E
5|$|Diamond's thermal {{conductivity}} is {{made use of}} by jewelers and gemologists who may employ an electronic thermal probe to separate diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist {{of a pair of}} battery-powered thermistors mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. This test <b>takes</b> <b>about</b> 2–3 seconds.|$|E

5|$|Fertilization by a spermatozoon, when it occurs, {{usually takes}} place in the ampulla, the widest section of the fallopian tubes. A fertilized egg {{immediately}} begins the process of embryogenesis, or development. The developing embryo <b>takes</b> <b>about</b> three days to reach the uterus and another three days to implant into the endometrium. It has usually reached the blastocyst stage at the time of implantation.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 2015, Donecle, a Toulouse {{start-up}} company, {{has also}} launched a drone approach which was initially specialized in {{the detection of}} lightning strikes on aeroplanes. Performed by five people equipped with harnesses and platforms, this inspection usually <b>takes</b> <b>about</b> eight hours. The immobilization of the aircraft and the staff are costly for the airlines, estimated at $10 000 per hour. The solution proposed by the start-up lasts twenty minutes.|$|E
5|$|It interbreeds {{regularly}} and extensively with the mallard, {{to which it}} is closely related. The female lays six to fourteen oval eggs, which have smooth shells and come in varied shades of white and buff green. Hatching takes 30 days on average. Incubation usually takes 25 to 26 days, with both sexes sharing duties, although the male usually defends the territory until the female reaches the middle of her incubation period. It <b>takes</b> <b>about</b> six weeks to fledge. Once the eggs hatch, the hen leads the brood to rearing areas with abundant invertebrates and vegetation.|$|E

5|$|The Pennsylvanian is a 444-mile (715km) daytime Amtrak {{train running}} between New York and Pittsburgh via Philadelphia. The trains travel across the Appalachian Mountains, through Pennsylvania's capital Harrisburg, the Pennsylvania Dutch Country, {{suburban}} and central Philadelphia, and New Jersey {{en route to}} New York. Trains run once daily in each direction and utilize Amfleet equipment. The entire train ride <b>takes</b> <b>about</b> 9 hours total, with 1.5 hours between New York and Philadelphia, 2 hours between Philadelphia and Harrisburg, and 5.5 hours between Harrisburg and Pittsburgh.|$|E
5|$|The {{line has}} been {{suggested}} preserved as a cultural heritage, since it represents one of very few railways with the original narrow gauge profile intact. However, all stations have been demolished; Flekkefjord in 1970, Sirnes in 1977 and Flikkeid in 1988. The organization Friends of the Flekkefjord Line offer rental of draisines for tourists since {{the closure of the}} line, and a round trip from Flekkefjord to Bakkekleivi just outside Sira <b>takes</b> <b>about</b> three hours. However, the Norwegian National Rail Administration have since banned the operation of draisines until the line is fully fenced in.|$|E
5|$|Transport between islands is {{primarily}} by ferry, and Shetland Islands Council operates various inter-island services. Shetland is also {{served by a}} domestic connection from Lerwick to Aberdeen on mainland Scotland. This service, which <b>takes</b> <b>about</b> 12 hours, is operated by NorthLink Ferries. Some services also call at Kirkwall, Orkney, which increases the journey time between Aberdeen and Lerwick by 2 hours. There are plans for road tunnels {{to some of the}} islands, especially Bressay and Whalsay, however it is hard to convince the mainland government to finance them.|$|E

5|$|According {{to current}} knowledge, B.sessilis as an {{extremely}} hardy plant that {{grows in a}} range of soils and aspects, so long as it is given good drainage, and tolerates both drought and moderate frost. Unlike many dryandras, it grows well on limestone (alkaline) soils. It flowers very heavily and is an excellent producer of honey. It attracts birds, and is also popular with beekeepers. However, its size makes it unsuitable for smaller gardens, and if given an ideal situation it may produce a great many seedlings. It is propagated only from seed, as propagating it from cuttings has proven virtually impossible. Germination <b>takes</b> <b>about</b> five or six weeks, and plants may take two years to flower.|$|E
5|$|Adult great spotted {{woodpeckers}} have {{a complete}} moult after the breeding season which <b>takes</b> <b>about</b> 120days. Northern D. m. major starts its moult from mid-June to late July and finishes in October or November, temperate races like D. m. pinetorum are earlier, commencing in early June to mid-July and completing in mid-September to late October, and southern D. m. hispanicus starts late May or June and finishes as early as August. Juveniles have a partial moult, retaining some of the wing coverts but replacing body, tail and primary feathers. This moult to near-adult plumage starts from late May to early August and finishes from mid-September to late November, timing varying with latitude as with the adults.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria can {{be grown}} in the {{laboratory}} on nutrient culture media, but viruses need living cells in which to replicate. Many vaccines to infectious diseases {{can be grown}} in fertilised chicken eggs. Millions of eggs are used each year to generate the annual flu vaccine requirements, a complex process that <b>takes</b> <b>about</b> {{six months after the}} decision is made as to what strains of virus to include in the new vaccine. A problem with using eggs for this purpose is that people with egg allergies are unable to be immunised, but this disadvantage may be overcome as new techniques for cell-based rather than egg-based culture become available. Cell-based culture will also be useful in a pandemic when {{it may be difficult to}} acquire a sufficiently large quantity of suitable sterile, fertile eggs.|$|E
