The films were prepared by r. f. (2. 3 MHz) plasma deposition from benzene and fluorinated benzenes, C 6 H 6 -mFm with 0 equal or smaller than m equal or smaller than 6. While the <b>thermal</b> <b>effusion</b> products of a-C:H are hydrocarbons and hydrogen, {{those of the}} a-C:H,F films depend {{on the degree of}} fluorination. Partially fluorinated a-C:H,F films corresponding to m = 1 release HF as well as hydrocarbons and hydrogen. The main effusion product of a-C:H,F films with intermediate fluorination (2 equal or smaller than m equal or smaller than 4) is HF. These a-C:H,F films are thermally less stable than a-C:H. More highly fluorinated films, corresponding to m = 5 and 6, release mainly CF 4 at temperatures typically 100 degree C higher than the desorption maximum of a-C:H and thus they are thermally more stable than a-C:H.

The phase separation of the layers into SiNCs and surrounding oxynitride matrix was studied at temperatures of up to 1150 °C.

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2005 Estimating {{depths of}} buried lava tubes is {{important}} for determining the <b>thermal</b> budgets and <b>effusion</b> rates of certain volcanic systems. This research uses a laboratory experiment scaled to an observed lava tube system to measure the 3 D temperature field surrounding a buried depth adjustable glass tube with hot honey flowing through it at varying conditions such as flow rate and temperature. Numerical techniques are used to model the laboratory experiment. The input parameters are then applied to non-laboratory situations. The surface thermal distributions from these models are analyzed to empirically derive a depth estimation function using regression techniques.

The latter was tailored by variation of the deposition temperature (T-dep = 50 degrees C- 400 degrees C) with hydrogen concentration [H] between 1 and 13 at. % and mass density rho(mass) between 2. 7 and 3. 2 g/cm(3). In contrast to films with intermediate material properties, the passivation by low-and high density films showed a reduced thermal stability at relatively high annealing temperatures (similar to 600 degrees C). These observations proved to be in good agreement with <b>thermal</b> <b>effusion</b> results of hydrogen and inert gas atoms that were also strongly dependent on film microstructure. We demonstrate that the temperature of maximum effusion decreased for films with progressively lower density (i. e., with increasing [H]). Therefore, the reduced thermal stability of the passivation for low-density hydrogen-rich ([H] &gt; similar to 5 at. %) films can be attributed to a loss of hydrogen at relatively low annealing temperatures. In contrast, the lower initial [H] for dense Al 2 O 3 films can likely explain the lower thermal stability associated with these films. The effusion measurements also allowed us to discuss the role of molecular-and atomic hydrogen during annealing. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics. [[URL]...|$|E

Maximum effusion temperature is found to increase as the silicon content of the samples is increased, indicating smaller openings and/or increasing rigidity of the network. Analysis of inert-gas diffusion in annealed films suggests that the diffusion process cannot be directly related to carbon bonding and hydrogen content in the films.

For O-bearing (O 16, -O 17, -O 18) molecules the alpha O- 17 / alpha O- 18 is expected at 0. 5 to 0. 515, and for S-bearing (S 32,-S 33. -S 34, -S 36) molecules, the alpha S- 33 / lpha S- 34 is expected at 0. 5 to 0. 508, where alpha is the isotope fractionation factor associated with unmixing processes. Thus, one isotope pair is generally proxied to yield all the information for the physical history of the gases. However, we recently] reported the violation of mass law for isotope fractionation among isotope pairs of multiple isotope system during gas diffusion or convection under thermal gradient (Thermal Gradient Induced Non-Mass Dependent effect, TGI-NMD). The mechanism(s) that is responsible to such striking observation remains unanswered. In our past studies, we investigated polyatomic molecules, O 2 and SF 6, and we suggested that nuclear spin effect could be responsible to the observed NMD effect in a way of changing diffusion coefficients of certain molecules, owing to the fact of negligible delta S- 36 anomaly for SF 6 [...] On the other hand, our results also showed that for both diffusion and convection under thermal gradient, this NMD effect is increased by lower gas pressure, bigger temperature gradient and lower average temperature, which indicate that the nuclear spin effect may not be the significant contributor as the energies involved in the hyperfine effect are much smaller than those with molecular collisions, especially under convective conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{thermodynamics}} of irreversible processes, {{based on}} the O n s a g e r reciprocal relations, is applied to a system consisting of a mixture of two substances, of which one can go over into the other. The mixture is enclosed in two communicating reservoirs at different temperatures T and T + ΔT. The situations, in which systems arrive, when one, two or more differences between the values of state parameters in the two reservoirs are kept fixed, are called “stationary states of first, second etc. order”. For the stationary state of the first order with fixed ?T the corresponding pressure difference ?P is calculated. This gives the thermomolecular pressure effect ΔP/ΔT = —Q*/v T = (h — U*) /v T, where h and v. are the mean specific enthalpy and volume. This equation shows the connection with the mechano-caloric effect Q*, since application of the O n s a g e r relations shows that Q* is the “heat of transfer” i. e. the heat supplied per unit of time from the surroundings to the reservoir at temperature T, when one unit of mass is transferred from one reservoir to {{the other in the}} stationary state of the second order with fixed ΔP and ΔT = 0 (uniform temperature). Similarly U* is the “energy of transfer”. The influence of ΔT on the relative separation (<b>thermal</b> <b>effusion)</b> and the “chemical affinity” of the two components is also calculated. The heat conduction can be split into an “abnormal” part due to the coupling of diffusion and chemical reaction between the components and a “normal” part also present when no reaction takes place. The results can be applied to liquid helium II, considered in the two-fluid theory as a mixture of “normal” (1) and “superfluid” (2) atoms, capable of the “chemical reaction” 1 ⇔ 2. When it is supposed that chemical equilibrium is immediately established and that only superfluid atoms can pass through a sufficiently narrow capillary, the above mentioned equation leads. to G o r t e r's formula v ΔP/ΔT = χ 1 ∂s/∂χ 1, where χ 1 is the fraction of normal atoms and s the mean specific entropy of the mixture. Under the same circumstances only the “normal” part of the heat conduction subsists...|$|E
