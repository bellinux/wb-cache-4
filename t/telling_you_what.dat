500|$|The game {{is noted}} for its simple combat system that would [...] "disappoint those craving sheer {{mechanical}} depth", as stated by GameSpots Miguel Lopez. [...] The game's puzzle design has been praised for creating a rewarding experience for players who work through challenges on their own; Kristen Reed of Eurogamer, for example, said that [...] "you quietly, logically, willingly proceed, and the illusion is perfect: the game never tells you what to do, even though the game is always <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> to do". [...] Ico is also considered a short game, taking between seven and ten hours for a single play through, which Game Revolution calls [...] "painfully short" [...] with [...] "no replay outside of self-imposed challenges". G4TV's Matthew Keil, however, felt that [...] "the game is so strong, many will finish 'Ico' {{in one or two}} sittings". [...] The lack of features in the North American release, which would become unlocked on subsequent playthroughs after completing the game, was said to reduce the replay value of the title. Electronic Gaming Monthly notes that [...] "Yorda would probably be the worst companion -she's scatterbrained and helpless; if not {{for the fact that the}} player develops a bond with her, making the game's ending all the more heartrending." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{correspondence}} between the two men, Hoffecker gave Rovelstad a number of tips {{about how to deal}} with Congress. [...] Even though the bill was still mired in committee, Hoffecker advised what to do once the bill was signed. [...] He did not know yet that Rovelstad was a sculptor, and wrote to him in September 1935 about the models to be submitted for approval, [...] "These should also be 10 [...] in diameter, and this is where your trouble commences. These sculptors all want to incorporate their own ideas in the design and ask anywhere from $400.00 to $1,000.00 for their work, <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> trouble it is to get the approval of the Commission of Fine Arts and many other things which do not exist." [...] Hoffecker also offered to handle the issue for the committee; he proposed to advance the money necessary to purchase the new coins from the government and to handle the distribution. [...] He stated that he had enjoyed the distribution of the Old Spanish Trail piece, though he lied to Rovelstad, stating he was not a coin dealer—the letterhead that Hoffecker used to write to Rovelstad said [...] "Loans and Mortgages" [...] under his name. He also warned Rovelstad, [...] "It would not be good for either of us if the word got out you had disposed of the entire issue to me." ...|$|E
500|$|The series {{initially}} gained {{interest from}} major terrestrial networks {{such as the}} BBC and ITV. However, Max Beesley and Philip Glenister grew frustrated with the comments from the commissioning teams from the networks. Glenister stated that [...] "the problem with the BBC and ITV is more people coming in and <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> to do; we are grown up and big enough {{to know where the}} boundaries are". They ultimately settled for Sky, as the network was [...] "the one that we believed would let us do what we wanted". In January 2012, Glenister believed their decision to go with Sky was [...] "vindicated", as the terrestrial networks would restrict its content, violence, and language. He stated that the restrictions would not make the series [...] "the show it is and it wouldn't be the show we wanted to make". Head of Sky Drama Elaine Pyke had an immediate interest in the project, as she was [...] "immediately grabbed by how thrilling, scary, and funny it is", believing it to be [...] "the perfect show for Sky1". In a separate interview, Beesley stated: [...] "Andy Harries basically put the show out to a few of the networks and Sky said, 'Here's the money, go and make it and we'll give you notes later on, but really do have the freedom to make it,' which is great, and there's not a lot of that happens nowadays." ...|$|E

500|$|Critics {{praised the}} core {{morphing}} concept but criticized its repetitive gameplay, awkward controls, easy combat, disorganized introduction, and overemphasis on tutorial. Bramwell (Eurogamer) wrote that though the fundamental idea was good, the repetitious combinations of elemental attacks were rarely novel and often laborious. The excitement of realizing a puzzle's solution, Bramwell said, was often ruined by the player's struggle {{to perform the}} task correctly. He wrote that the game's design constrained players and [...] "bred apathy". For example, tutorials followed the scenes {{in which they would}} have been useful, cutscenes left no puzzle solution to imagination, puzzle solutions were rarely revisited after their first use, and character dialogue overstated the importance of simple puzzles. Bramwell was [...] "desperate" [...] for the freedom to experiment without forced guidance. [...] "The game", he wrote, [...] "hardly ever stops <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> to do." [...] Clayman (IGN) agreed that there was too much help but alternatively appreciated the continual challenge and activity density of Kameo level design, with townspeople interspersed within the level's action. He also liked to experiment in the Badlands as a break from the puzzles. Clayman found the game's combat easy but fun. He especially enjoyed the slowed time combat. Bramwell (Eurogamer) said that the [...] "relative pleasure" [...] of Kameo combat was ultimately worth little, as the player could use basic attacks and avoid most major upgrades throughout the whole game. Phil Theobald (GameSpy) added that character upgrades were required for maintaining interest in the gameplay, but that the game does not incentivize finding such combinations. Pfister (1UP.com) too found the gameplay balance and puzzle design insipid.|$|E
500|$|Edgar Wright's contribution, Don't, was {{produced}} {{in the style of}} a 1970s' Hammer House of Horror film trailer. The trailer featured appearances from Jason Isaacs, Matthew Macfadyen, singer Katie Melua, Lee Ingleby, Georgina Chapman, Emily Booth, Stuart Wilson, Lucy Punch, Rafe Spall, Wright regulars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, and a voice-over by Will Arnett. Mark Gatiss, MyAnna Buring, Peter Serafinowicz, Michael Smiley and Nicola Cunningham (who played the zombie [...] "Mary" [...] in Shaun of the Dead), among others, made uncredited cameo appearances. [...] To get the necessary 1970s look, Wright used vintage lenses and old-style graphics. During editing, he scratched some of the film with steel wool and dragged it around a parking lot to make it appear neglected by wayward projectionists. According to Wright, [...] "In the '70s, when American International would release European horror films, they'd give them snazzier titles. And the one that inspired me was this Jorge Grau film: In the UK, it's called The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue. In Spain and in Italy, I think it's called Do Not Speak Ill of the Dead. But in the States, it was called Don't Open the Window. I just loved the fact that there isn't a big window scene in the film—it's all based around the spin and the voiceover not really <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> {{the hell is going on}} in the film." [...] On the Charlie Rose talk show, Quentin Tarantino also pointed out another aspect of American advertising of British films in the 1970s that was being referenced—none of the actors have any dialogue in the trailer, as if the trailer was intentionally edited to prevent American viewers from realizing that the film is British.|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times said, [...] " [...] overstuffed with plot lines, set {{pieces and}} villains, {{although}} stars Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone {{do their best}} to give the movie heart." [...] Tim Robey of The Telegraph said, [...] "Marc Webb's Spider-Man sequel is overstuffed with high-voltage villains, but the sparks between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone save the day". Simon Reynolds of Digital Spy said, [...] "Peter's past, present and future all intertwine in a sequel that offers bang for your buck. That said you can't help [...] feel the franchise bean counters at work here thanks to all the ominous foreshadowing and unresolved character arcs. Too many cooks and all that...". Kim Newman of Empire scored the film three out of five stars, saying: [...] "A few too-broad gags aside — and even these are in the funky spirit of '60s Marvel — this is a satisfying second issue with thrills, heartbreak, gasps, and a perfectly judged slingshot ending." [...] Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "The eponymous hero hits his super-heroic stride here, as does Andrew Garfield in the role, especially when Spider-Man's alter ego Peter Parker learns there's always some fine print in a contract with this many benefits. The plot gets itself tangled up in multiple villain strands, but in the main, this installment is emotionally weightier and more satisfying than its predecessor." [...] Guy Lodge of Variety said, [...] "Redundancy remains a problem, but this overlong superhero sequel gets by on sound, fury and star chemistry." [...] Richard Roeper gave the film a B+, stating that [...] "It's about 20 minutes too long and it's overstuffed with too many characters and too many subplots, but there's enough good stuff in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 to warrant optimism about the next chapter of the franchise." [...] A negative review came from Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, giving the film two stars out of four, he said: [...] "Things go wrong quickly with Amazing 2. Am I the only one who hates the word Amazing to describe a movie that isn't? Just asking." [...] IGN reviewer Daniel Krupa gave 6.9/10 and wrote, [...] "Amazing Spider-Man 2 gets a lot right, yet there’s a constant awkwardness to the machinery of its plot; you can almost hear the cogs turning. However, what’s worse is that at times it becomes overtly patronising: there are flashing screens and computer voice-overs constantly <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> something is or what something is doing, just in case the people in the back rows aren’t paying attention, which feels at odds with the film’s emotional intelligence.|$|E

[...] The [...] "I" [...] in the lyrics was usually only implied, mainly because it did not quite fit the rhythm of the song, like the updated version on the 1983 album Out of Step, which is slower, allotting a bridge where MacKaye explains his philosophy of straight edge, explaining that straight edge [...] "is not a set of rules; I'm not <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> to do. All I'm saying is there are three things, that are like so important to the whole world that I don't happen to find much importance in, whether it's fucking, or whether it's playing golf, because of that, I feel...

2500|$|Some BBC staff {{felt that}} too much blame had been placed on their {{organisation}} {{in the wake of}} the David Kelly affair in the Hutton Report, and that the government was interfering in the BBC. Tim Gospill, spokesman for the National Union of Journalists said [...] "Being independent doesn't just mean not having the government <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> to do. It means you can criticise the government as well. I'm not at all sure the government understands that." [...] Groups of staff staged walk outs from Broadcasting House and other BBC offices in Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle, Glasgow, Cardiff and Londonderry, in protest at Dyke's resignation. In addition, on 31 January 2004, BBC staff paid for a full-page advert in the Daily Telegraph to express their [...] "dismay" [...] over Dyke's departure. The fundraisers hoped to raise £10,000, a lot less than the market rate for a full page advert in a broadsheet newspaper. Reportedly they raised less than this amount, but were offered a deal by the Telegraph's advertising department which allowed the advert to be printed. It was signed by around 4,000 BBC employees; 10,000 (around a third of total BBC staff at the time) submitted their names for publication, but there was not sufficient space to include them all.|$|E
