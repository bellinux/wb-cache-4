5|$|The PC and Macintosh {{versions}} of Star Wars: Dark Forces were well received, with the MS-DOS version holding an aggregate score on GameRankings of 77%. Publications compared Dark Forces to Doom, a significant video {{game in the}} first-person shooter genre at the time, but also indicated that Dark Forces improved upon Dooms features. Criticisms <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the game being too short, as well as lacking a multiplayer feature.|$|E

She continued to advance her trademark interests of education and literacy by establishing the semi-annual National Book Festival in 2001, and encouraged education on a worldwide scale. She also advanced women's causes through The Heart Truth and Susan G. Komen for the Cure organizations. She represented the United States during her foreign trips, which <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> HIV/AIDS and malaria awareness.|$|E
5|$|The Search for Spock {{opened on}} June 1, 1984. In its {{first week of}} release, the film grossed over $16 million from almost 2,000 theaters across North America. It went on to gross $76 million at the {{domestic}} box office, {{with a total of}} $87 million worldwide. Critical reaction to The Search for Spock was positive, but notably less so than the previous film. Reviewers generally praised the cast and characters, while criticism <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the plot; the special effects were conflictingly received. Roger Ebert called the film a compromise between the tones of the first and second Star Trek films. The Search for Spock has since been released on multiple home video formats, including VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray high definition discs. Nimoy went on to direct The Search for Spocks sequel, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{material}} written about her was aimed at children, and <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> her childhood and early career. Much of it was also highly romanticised and not always historically accurate. She has been referenced in several historical novels, most notably in The French Lieutenant's Woman (1969) by John Fowles, who was critical {{of the fact that}} no British scientist had named a species after her in her lifetime. As her biographer, Shelley Emling, noted, this contrasted with some of the prominent geologists who had used her finds, such as William Buckland and Roderick Murchison, who ended up with multiple fossil species named after them. The only person who did name a species after her during her lifetime was the Swiss-American naturalist, Louis Agassiz. In the early 1840s, he named two fossil fish species after her—Acrodus anningiae, and Belenostomus anningiae—and another after her friend Elizabeth Philpot. Agassiz was grateful for the help the women had given him in examining fossil fish specimens during his visit to Lyme Regis in 1834. After her death, other species, including the ostracod Cytherelloidea anningi, and two genera, the therapsid reptile genus Anningia, and the bivalve mollusc genus Anningella, were named in her honour. In 2012, the plesiosaur genus Anningasaura was named for her, and the species Ichthyosaurus anningae was named for her in 2015.|$|E

State federations <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> state {{legislative}} lobbying, statewide economic policy, state elections, and other issues of a more overarching nature. CLCs <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> county or city lobbying, city or county elections, county or city zoning and other economic issues, and more local needs.|$|R

25|$|With {{freedom of}} the press having been granted in 1696, cricket for the first time could be {{reported}} in the newspapers.

25|$|Monasteries and {{practice}} centers were created that <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> either the Vinaya {{and training of}} monks or the teachings focused on one scripture or {{a small group of}} texts. Dhyāna (Chan) masters tended to practice in solitary hermitages, or to be associated with vinaya training monasteries or the dharma teaching centers. The later naming of the Zen school has its origins in this view of the threefold division of training.|$|E
25|$|Bound in Blood {{received}} mainly positive reviews. Most critics {{praised the}} plot, the general shooting mechanics, the game's authentic western tone, and the multiplayer mode. Criticism <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> poor enemy AI, repetitive level design, and, especially, {{the lack of}} any kind of co-op mode. Some critics also found the single-player mode too short and easy. The game was a commercial success, selling close to one million units worldwide across all systems, considerably more than the first game.|$|E
25|$|By the 19th century, {{the liberals}} had evolved into Unitarians. Not {{only did they}} deny the {{doctrine}} of the Trinity as unscriptural, they believed the Bible should be interpreted rationally, not in a literal manner. Their preaching focused on ethics rather than on doctrine and did not limit church membership to the converted. Unitarians did not participate in evangelistic societies due to their conviction that people informed by reason and scripture should be free to believe what they wanted. When they did organize, they <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> education and philanthropic causes.|$|E

Austen Chamberlain was, until his death, a member of the group as well. While there was no question that Churchill was the most prominent and effective, Amery's work was still significant. He was a driving force behind the creation of the Army League, a pressure group designed to keep the needs of the British Army before the public.|$|E
25|$|The World Bank, a United Nations {{specialized}} agency, {{has been}} a primary force in promoting the Habitat conferences, and since the first Habitat conference has used their declarations {{as a framework for}} issuing loans for urban infrastructure. The bank's structural adjustment programs contributed to urbanization in the Third World by creating incentives to move to cities. The World Bank and UN-Habitat in 1999 jointly established the Cities Alliance (based at the World Bank headquarters in Washington, D.C.) to guide policymaking, knowledge sharing, and grant distribution around the issue of urban poverty. (UN-Habitat plays an advisory role in evaluating the quality of a locality's governance.) The Bank's policies have <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> bolstering real estate markets through credit and technical assistance.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} before World War II, the music {{industry}} began to refer to honky-tonk music played from Texas and Oklahoma to the West Coast as hillbilly music. More recently, the term has come {{to refer to the}} primary sound in country music, developing in Nashville as Western swing became accepted there. Originally, it featured the guitar, fiddle, string bass, and steel guitar (imported from Hawaiian folk music). The vocals were originally rough and nasal, as exemplified by the singer-songwriters Floyd Tillman and Hank Williams, but later developed a clear and sharp sound, such as that of George Jones and Faron Young. Lyrics <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> working-class life, with frequently tragic themes of lost love, adultery, loneliness, alcoholism, and self-pity.|$|E

25|$|The basic {{features}} of the British metrication programme as announced in 1966 was a voluntary adoption of the metric programme with the costs being absorbed where they fell. As a result, the costs and savings of metrication in the United Kingdom have not been comprehensively determined and studies have <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> specific programmes. The impact of a voluntary programme meant that industry was free to take the most cost-efficient approach, which in many cases has meant installing equipment calibrated in metric units {{as part of an}} ongoing maintenance cycle rather than as part of a specific metrication programme. Such an approach was taken by the gas industry where all newly installed meters record usage in cubic metres, but many older installations will measure in cubic feet.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the fourth}} direct {{election}} for the President of the Republic of China. The two candidates were Democratic Progressive Party candidate Frank Hsieh and Kuomintang (KMT) nominee Ma Ying-jeou. The KMT ticket was officially formed as of June 23, 2007, with Ma announcing his choice for running mate to be former premier Vincent Siew. The DPP ticket was announced in August, 2007, with Frank Hsieh selecting former Premier Su Tseng-chang. Unlike the 2004 presidential election, the political rhetoric of the campaigns <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> economic issues and government corruption rather than national identity and the political status of Taiwan, with both candidates endorsing {{the status quo in}} the short term. But much like previous elections, this election was also marked with island-wide mass rallies and much political mudslinging.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the {{euthanasia}} {{debate has}} <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> {{a number of}} key concerns. According to euthanasia opponent Ezekiel Emanuel, proponents of euthanasia have presented four main arguments: a) that {{people have a right to}} self-determination, and thus should be allowed to choose their own fate; b) assisting a subject to die might be a better choice than requiring that they continue to suffer; c) the distinction between passive euthanasia, which is often permitted, and active euthanasia, which is not substantive (or that the underlying principle–the doctrine of double effect–is unreasonable or unsound); and d) permitting euthanasia will not necessarily lead to unacceptable consequences. Pro-euthanasia activists often point to countries like the Netherlands and Belgium, and states like Oregon, where euthanasia has been legalized, to argue that it is mostly unproblematic.|$|E
