5|$|In {{the first}} days of the operation, the 697th Regiment of the 342nd Infantry Division, {{supported}} by NDH units, thrust out of their bridgehead over the Drina at Zvornik and cleared the high ground southwest and south of that town, and south along the Drina valley road, hindered by roadblocks and destroyed bridges. It then followed up the retreating insurgents, mopping up the Drinjača valley, before pushing southwest through the mountains and reaching Vlasenica on 18 January. Parts of the 698th Regiment of the 342nd Infantry Division fought southwest from Višegrad along the upper Drina valley to Međeđa, while other elements pushed west towards Rogatica, followed by an Italian Alpini battalion. The 699th Regiment of the 342nd Infantry Division advanced along the Drina valley past the confluence with the Drinjača to the area west of Ljubovija, clearing roadblocks as <b>they</b> <b>went.</b> <b>In</b> the area of Milići, they captured about 400 insurgents, mostly Chetniks loyal to Jezdimir Dangić, along with a tank, two machine guns, about 160 rifles and a large amount of ammunition. The regiment then mopped up the area west to Vlasenica and one battalion cleared the route to Srebrenica.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the next two days, the {{battalion}} withdrew towards Athens, where they arrived in the early morning on 24 April. They continued on to the beach at Porto Rafti, destroying their vehicles and other equipment as <b>they</b> <b>went.</b> <b>In</b> the confusion of orders and counter orders, the battalion's carrier and mortar platoons had gotten separated from the rest of the unit. By 9:00pm on 24 April when the final move to the beach commenced they still had not arrived. The operation went according to plan however, and by 3:00am on 25 April the transports embarked. Of the various groups that had become detached from the battalion, some were able to make their own way to the embarkation beaches, but a number of them were ultimately captured. The battalion's casualties in Greece were 10 killed or died of wounds, six wounded, 83 captured, 11 wounded and captured.|$|E

Fire fighters were called to the scene shortly after 3:30am and spent ninety minutes fanning the blaze, which started in the bus ventilation/air-conditioning unit and caused an estimated $50,000 (€32,000) worth of damage. Talking to local newspaper the Boston Herald, the band's manager, Foye Johnson said: [...] "The guys were basically around the bus, which {{was a good thing}} because {{we were able to get}} all the equipment and instruments out."

500|$|As the British forces {{advanced}} on the American line, Phillips and Abercrombie {{noticed that}} one enterprising company of Virginia militia {{had established a}} position on a hill that provided them with an excellent opportunity to enfilade the British line. [...] Abercrombie sent the jägers to flush them out. [...] The lines then closed, and the action became general. [...] The first line of militia put up stiffer resistance than the British anticipated. [...] The British artillery, {{and the strength of}} numbers that threatened to flank their position convinced the first militia line to retreat to the second after half an hour of resistance. [...] Phillips also detached Simcoe and his rangers on a lengthy and roundabout flanking maneuver intended to prevent the Americans from retreating across the Pocahontas Bridge. [...] While Simcoe moved, Phillips made two assaults on the second militia line, both of which were repulsed. [...] It was not until the British artillery was in position to rake the American line more than an hour later that von Steuben finally ordered the retreat. [...] The Americans were eventually able to make an orderly retreat across the bridge, covered by the men placed on the high ground above {{the far side of the}} bridge. [...] The last companies across took up the bridge planking as <b>they</b> <b>went,</b> <b>in</b> order to delay pursuit (an act which later earned them the praise of contemporaries such as Thomas Jefferson, General Nathanael Greene, and others).|$|E
