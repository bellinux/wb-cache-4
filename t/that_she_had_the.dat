5|$|Mulder {{meets with}} Margaret Scully in a park, {{and tries to}} give her Scully's {{necklace}}. Margaret returns the necklace to Mulder, asking that he give it to Scully when he finds her. Margaret also says <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> dream again about losing her daughter; Mulder takes this as a hopeful sign that Scully may still be alive. A mournful Mulder later returns to Skyland Mountain, to the field where Scully was abducted. Seemingly alone without her, he looks up into the stars.|$|E
5|$|Perez began {{training}} at Jesse Hernandez's School of Hard Knocks in San Bernardino, California, {{and made her}} in-ring debut in April 2002. Many officials stated <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> most natural ability of any woman who came through their school. In late 2002, Perez auditioned for World Wrestling Entertainment's reality show Tough Enough III, making it through to the final twenty-one, before being eliminated in the final cut of the first episode. After she was eliminated from the contest, trainer Al Snow encouraged her to keep trying to pursue her dream as a wrestler.|$|E
5|$|Blackwell and {{her parents}} lived in Lula, until 1936 when she was three years old; Blackwell's father left the {{plantation}} on which he worked, and fled to Memphis, Tennessee, fearing for his life after he confronted his boss about speaking to his wife. Soon afterwards, Blackwell and her mother left the plantation to live with him. Blackwell's family traveled frequently in search of work. On June 20, 1938, Blackwell's parents separated due to religious differences. Blackwell and her mother went to West Helena, Arkansas, to live with Blackwell's great aunt so <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to receive an education. A quality education in Mississippi {{was not an option}} for Blackwell because the schools there were centered on the cultivation of crops and the plantation system. While living in West Helena, Blackwell often visited her father in Memphis. During the summer months she would leave West Helena and live with her grandfather and grandmother in Lula, where she helped plant and harvest cotton. Blackwell spent a majority of her early years chopping cotton in Mississippi, Arkansas, and Tennessee and peeling tomatoes in Florida. She was 14 when she finished the eighth grade, the final year of school at Westside, a school in West Helena for black children. Blackwell had to quit school to earn for her family.|$|E

Even back in December 2007, Clinton was leading in the polls with 47%, and Obama had 26%. Clinton's aides responded to this by saying <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> money to continue a national campaign.

25|$|On 27 February 2012 Andrea Gilroy, David Gilroy's wife, {{was cited}} as a witness by the Crown.

She declined to give evidence. Mrs Gilroy could only decline to give evidence because the events she would speak to took place before section 86 of the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 came into force. This act amended the law such that spouses and civil partners of an accused person in Scotland, are competent and compellable witnesses for the prosecution.|$|E
25|$|DuBois {{refers to}} herself as a medium and profiler, rather than a psychic, because of the {{negative}} connotation she feels {{is associated with the}} term psychic. She claims that she became aware <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> ability to communicate with departed souls when she was 6 years old. DuBois claims she uses this ability to connect deceased loved ones to the living, and also to help law enforcement agencies solve crimes, such as the Texas Rangers and the Glendale, Arizona police department, and that she used these abilities as a jury consultant. These law enforcement agencies have since either denied any such cooperation happened or stated the tips provided by DuBois were not helpful.|$|E

25|$|Because Rhodesian exports were {{generally}} competitive and {{had previously been}} entitled to preferential treatment on the British market, the former colony did not recognise the need for escalating the pace of diversification before independence. Following the UDI, however, Rhodesia began to demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> potential to develop {{a greater degree of}} economic self-sufficiency. After the Rhodesian Front began introducing incentives accorded to domestic production, industrial output expanded dramatically. A rigid system of countermeasures enacted to combat sanctions succeeded in blunting their impact for at least a decade. Over the next nine years Rhodesian companies, spiting the freezing of their assets and blocking of overseas accounts, also perfected cunning techniques of sanctions evasion through both local and foreign subsidiaries, which operated on a clandestine trade network.|$|E
25|$|Just {{prior to}} the runoff {{election}} {{at a meeting of}} East Texas superintendents, Bruner gave a speech to the educators, during which she repeatedly made inaccurate statements about Texas education that forced her audience to fact-check her on the spot. Bruner tried asserting that 50 percent of Texas students are in a special education program, that only one in six public school graduates can read with fluency and comprehension, and that one school district started the year with 91 full-time substitute teachers. At each of these statements, different audience members interrupted Bruner's speech to inform her that her statements were not factual. After an audience member stood up and suggested to Bruner that she visit with superintendents of the area, to which Bruner replied <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had,</b> <b>the</b> local county superintendent stood up and informed Bruner that she had never attempted to meet with her.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} the Plessy ruling was immediate; there were already {{significant}} differences in funding for the segregated school system, which continued into the 20th century; states consistently underfunded black schools, providing them with substandard buildings, textbooks, and supplies. States which had successfully integrated elements of their society abruptly adopted oppressive legislation that erased reconstruction era efforts. The principles of Plessy v. Ferguson were affirmed in Lum v. Rice (1927), which upheld {{the right of a}} Mississippi public school for white children to exclude a Chinese American girl. Despite the laws enforcing compulsory education, and the lack of public schools for Chinese children in Lum's area, the Supreme Court ruled <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> choice to attend a private school. Jim Crow laws and practices spread northward in response to a second wave of African-American migration from the South to northern and midwestern cities. Some established de jure segregated educational facilities, separate public institutions such as hotels and restaurants, separate beaches among other public facilities, and restrictions on interracial marriage, but in other cases segregation in the North was related to unstated practices and operated on a de facto basis, although not by law, among numerous other facets of daily life.|$|E

25|$|By all accounts, Eleanor's father ensured <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> best {{possible}} education. Eleanor came to learn arithmetic, the constellations, and history. She also learned domestic {{skills such as}} household management and the needle arts of embroidery, needlepoint, sewing, spinning, and weaving. Eleanor developed skills in conversation, dancing, games such as backgammon, checkers, and chess, playing the harp, and singing. Although her native tongue was Poitevin, she was taught to read and speak Latin, was well versed in music and literature, and schooled in riding, hawking, and hunting. Eleanor was extroverted, lively, intelligent, and strong-willed. In the spring of 1130 her four-year-old brother William Aigret and their mother died at the castle of Talmont on Aquitaine's Atlantic coast. Eleanor became the heir presumptive to her father's domains. The Duchy of Aquitaine was the largest and richest province of France. Poitou, where Eleanor {{spent most of her}} childhood, and Aquitaine together were almost one-third the size of modern France. Eleanor had only one other legitimate sibling, a younger sister named Aelith, also called Petronilla. Her half brother Joscelin was acknowledged by WilliamX as a son, but not as his heir. That she had another half brother, William, has been discredited. Later, during the first four years of HenryII's reign, her siblings joined Eleanor's royal household.|$|E
