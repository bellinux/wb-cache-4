25|$|A modern {{concept that}} God {{is in need}} of human beings has been propounded by Abraham Joshua Heschel. Because God is in search of people, God is {{accessible}} and available through time and place to whoever seeks Him, leading to a spiritual intensity for the individual as well. This accessibility leads to a God who is present, involved, near, intimate, and concerned for and vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> in this world.|$|E
25|$|Many {{religious}} and philosophical traditions support {{the view that}} the soul is the ethereal substance – a spirit; a non material spark – particular to a unique living being. Such traditions often consider the soul both immortal and innately aware of its immortal nature, as well as the true basis for sentience in each living being. The concept of the soul has strong links with notions of an afterlife, but opinions may vary wildly even within a given religion as <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> to the soul after death. Many within these religions and philosophies see the soul as immaterial, while others consider it possibly material.|$|E
25|$|This {{mechanism}} is similar <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> with the green-beard effect, {{but with the}} green-beard effect, the actor has to instead identify which of its social partners share the gene for cooperation. A green-beard system must always co-occur within individuals and alleles to produce a perceptible trait, recognition of this trait in others, and preferential treatment to those recognized. Examples of green-beard behavior {{have been found in}} hydrozoans, slime molds, yeast, and ants. An example is in side-blotch lizards, where blue-throated males preferentially establish territories next to each other. Results show that neighboring blue-throats are more successful at mate guarding. However, blue males next to larger, more aggressive orange males suffer a cost.|$|E

25|$|R. romandi is a swarm-founding species, {{which means}} its colonies are {{founded by a}} swarm of workers associating with queens (fertilized females). This is in {{contrast}} <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> in independent-founding species, where the colony is founded by only {{one or a few}} fertilized females. R. romandi has been found to manage perennial nests that can last a few years. This means that the colony does not die off in the winter as they do in annual colonies, but they instead survive the winter and manage the same nest the following season. Because of this, swarm-founding species normally have larger colonies with more queens than independent-founding species. Colony survival over the winter is thought to be possible because R. romandi practices seasonal colony activity. This means that in summer, the wasps are more active, performing active reproduction, while in the winter the number of reproductives dies off, and no reproductive activity is observed.|$|E
25|$|Of {{paramount}} {{importance to the}} designers was {{that the story of}} the film be treated as sacrosanct – nothing the player can do in the game can ever alter, contradict or in any way run contrary <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> in the film. David Yorkin, Bud's son, and David Leary worked on the game's script, initially writing it as a linear game. However, the designers wanted the game to feature a great deal of random elements, with the idea being that no two playthroughs would be the same, and no walkthrough would be able to cover every possible eventuality or every possible combination of random events. The game presents the player with fifteen suspects, but only two are always replicants (Clovis and a cook named Zuben). Which of the other thirteen characters is a replicant is randomized every time the player plays the game, and their behavior is different each playthrough based upon {{whether or not they are}} human. Due to the random nature of the game, the script swelled to 500 pages, and the quality assurance people had to play through the game 2,500 times to experience every possible variation.|$|E
25|$|Luminescent Bacteria: Hastings {{investigations}} of luminous bacteria {{acted as a}} catalyst for the discoveries of the biochemical mechanisms involved in their light production, the discovery of a flavin to be a substrate in its luciferase reaction, the determination of gene regulation of the luciferases, and the first evidence for quorum sensing, a form of bacterial communication. In quorum sensing (initially termed autoinduction), the bacteria release a substance into the medium, the autoinducer. Once the concentration of this substance reaches a critical level (a measure of the number of bacteria in a limited area), transcription of specific other genes that had been repressed are turned on. Once the sequenced autoinducer gene was found to occur widely in gram-negative bacteria quorum sensing became accepted in the early 1990s. It is now known that in many pathogenic bacteria, there is delayed production of toxins, which serve to greatly augment their pathogenicity, this is similar <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> for luciferase proteins. By curtailing their toxin output until the bacterial populations are substantial, these bacteria can generate massive quantities of toxin quickly and thereby swamp the defences of the host.|$|E

25|$|Festa Junina was {{introduced}} to Northeastern Brazil by the Portuguese for whom St John's day (also celebrated as Midsummer Day in several European countries), on the 24th of June, {{is one of the}} oldest and most popular celebrations of the year. Differently from what happens on the European Midsummer Day, the festivities in Brazil do not take place during the summer solstice but during the tropical winter solstice. The festivities traditionally begin after the 12th of June, on the eve of St Anthony's day, and last until the 29th, which is Saint Peter's day. During these fifteen days, there are bonfires, fireworks, and folk dancing in the streets. Typical foods and beverages are served. It should be noted that, as during Carnival, these festivities involve wearing costumes (in this case, peasant costumes), dancing, heavy drinking, and visual spectacles (fireworks display and folk dancing). Similar <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> on Midsummer and St John's Day in Europe, bonfires are a central part of these festivities in Brazil.

500|$|This move {{sequence}} {{is called the}} [...] "Rubinstein variation" [...] {{in reference to the}} famous game Rubinstein–Vidmar (Berlin 1918) when 4.Bf4 was first employed. Various authors consider this move to be the most dangerous for Black. It aims to answer 4...Bc5 with 5.e3 without blocking the Bc1, contrary <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> in the Adler variation 4.Nf3. Another point is that in the Adler variation White faces the risk of a strong attack against his kingside (see section [...] "Budapest rook"), while in the 4.Bf4 variation this is seldom the case because the Bf4 is well placed to protect White's kingside. On the other hand, the early development of the bishop means that White is more vulnerable to the check Bf8–b4+, the b2-pawn is not defended, and in some rare cases the Bf4 can become subject to attack.|$|E
500|$|Miller also {{aimed to}} imbue the novel {{with a sense}} of anxiety, {{especially}} concerning the decisions Jean-Baptiste must take. Commenting on fiction in general in an interview with Lorna Bradbury for The Daily Telegraph, Miller stated that [...] "a novel is a collection of anxieties held together, more or less well, more or less interestingly, by the chicken wire of plot". Bradbury goes on to state [...] "that is absolutely the case with Pure, which details multiple counts of insanity as the panic-inducing business of razing the cemetery takes hold". Of Pure specifically, Miller stated that [...] "I'm interested in what anxiety does to people", [...] "in what happens when they can't respond the way the world expects them <b>to.</b> <b>What</b> <b>happens</b> when our sense of ourselves falls away under the pressure of circumstances?

500|$|On {{the time}} periods the series could {{potentially}} explore following {{the first season}} given Carter's role in , Atwell said, [...] "I think {{the great thing about}} the fact that I've already played her {{at the end of her}} life means that we know ... we have an opportunity, if the show does go into second and third and fourth and fifth , we know that we can explore all of these aspects of her character because we know she lives such a long life and she's had a fulfilled life. I think what's going to start happening in Season 1 is seeds are going to be planted as <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> in her personal life—and yet it's still open to the possibility of new men coming into her life, deepening relationships with the men that we discover in Season 1. Obviously, the era is 1946 but in the second, third, fourth, fifth season—if it goes onto that—we can explore different time periods. We can explore the late forties, the early fifties, the sixties, the seventies, the eighties, up until present day, so it's very exciting because of that." [...] However, Butters clarified that future seasons would likely stay in the same time period, possibly changing location to a place like Hollywood or Europe, to remain in a pre-S.H.I.E.L.D. setting and avoid competing with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. This was the case with the second season, which moved the series to 1947 Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|Jeffrey Brent, {{the past}} {{president}} of the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology, was invited to testify about the potential role of thimerosal-containing vaccines in triggering Michelle's autism. He stated that [...] "there was not a single study indicating that any form of mercury could cause serious neurological symptoms in the dosages that were used in vaccines" [...] and criticized Aposhian's use of in vitro studies and his equating them <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> in the actual animal, arguing that [...] "the exposure to a cell in a petri dish was far more likely to cause damage than an equivalent dosage in a living system." [...] With regard to specific in vitro studies, Brent argued that the Goth study was flawed because it tested thimerosal on mouse cells, not human cells; because these cells were exposed not to ethylmercury, as the human body would be after receiving a thimerosal-containing vaccine since thimerosal is quickly metabolized to ethylmercury, but to thimerosal itself, and because the cells were exposed to far higher concentrations of thimerosal than could ever occur {{as a result of the}} administration of thimerosal-containing vaccines. Brent highlighted similar problems with the Agrawal study, noting that the cells in that study, like those in the Goth study, were exposed to thimerosal, not ethylmercury, and to much higher doses than found in vaccines. He also examined the Bradstreet and Geier study and the Holmes study, noting that [...] "much better studies from other investigators could not replicate the results of either the Holmes study or the Bradstreet/Geier study," [...] citing two other peer-reviewed papers which had concluded that hair mercury levels were not significantly different between study participants with autism and controls, as well as a study which had concluded that children with autism had no chelatable heavy-metal body burden whatsoever. Brent also pointed out that, like another of Bradstreet's studies, the Bradstreet-Geier study had been published in a non-indexed journal, the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons, which he described as [...] "very much of a fringe journal with lots of alternative agendas, and it's not even indexed by the National Library of Medicine." [...] Brent concluded by testifying that thimerosal could not have degraded Michelle's immune system to the extent that when she was vaccinated with MMR nine months later, it caused brain damage, saying [...] "That couldn't possibly be the case." [...] In the second set of the proceedings, which pertained to thimerosal alone (as opposed to thimerosal working in conjunction with MMR), Brent testified, with regard to Jordan King and one other child with autism who also served as a test case in this trial, that there was [...] "absolutely no reason to chelate them for any mercury-related reason." ...|$|E
