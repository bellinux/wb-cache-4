5|$|There were gardens at Aberdour Castle from {{at least}} 1540. The terraced garden dates {{from the time of}} the 4th Earl of Morton, who succeeded in 1553, and {{comprises}} four broad L-shaped <b>terraces.</b> At the bottom of the <b>terraces</b> was an orchard, laid out in 1690, and recently replanted. The extent of the terracing was only rediscovered following excavations in the 1970s, after parts of the garden had been in use as a market garden. Archaeological investigations were undertaken between 1977 and 1980, to determine whether the lower <b>terraces,</b> which were depicted on a map of 1740, had indeed existed. Although the foundations of the <b>terraces</b> were found, the remains could not be precisely dated, but are thought to have been constructed in the second half of the 16th century. The high retaining walls were rebuilt in 1981, and the <b>terraces</b> were laid with grass, since the excavations had not revealed any evidence of historic planting schemes.|$|E

5|$|The actual {{location}} of the battle {{is the subject of}} some controversy. According to Canadian explorer John Hemming, Spanish forces occupied a plain between Ollantaytambo and the Urubamba River while the main Inca army was located on a citadel (the Temple Hill) overlooking the town, protected by seventeen <b>terraces.</b> However, Swiss architect Jean-Pierre Protzen argues that the topography of the town and its surrounding area does not match contemporary descriptions of the battle. An anonymous account attributed to Diego de Silva claims that the Inca army occupied a set of eleven <b>terraces,</b> not seventeen; while the chronicle of Pedro Pizarro describes a gate flanked by walls as the only way through the <b>terraces.</b> Protzen thinks that these descriptions allude to a set of eleven <b>terraces</b> that close the plain of Mascabamba, near Ollantaytambo, which include the heavily fortified gate of T'iyupunku. At this location, when the Spaniards faced the <b>terraces</b> they would have had the Urubamba River to their left and the steep hill of Cerro Pinkuylluna to their right, matching the three sides from which they were attacked during the battle. If Protzen's hypothesis is correct, the river diverted to flood the battlefield was the Urubamba, and not its smaller affluent, the Patakancha, which runs alongside the town of Ollantaytambo.|$|E

5|$|Faced {{with these}} constraints, the Spanish {{expedition}} {{had to cross}} the river several times and fight at each ford against stiff opposition. The bulk of the Inca army confronted the Spaniards from a set of <b>terraces</b> overlooking a plain by the Urubamba River. Several Spanish assaults against the <b>terraces</b> failed against a shower of arrows, slingshots and boulders {{coming down from the}} <b>terraces</b> as well as from both flanks. To hinder the efforts of the Spanish cavalry the Incas flooded the plain using previously prepared channels; water eventually reached the horses' girths. The defenders then counterattacked; some of them used Spanish weapons captured in previous encounters such as swords, bucklers, armor and even a horse, ridden by Manco Inca himself. In a severely compromised situation, Hernando Pizarro ordered a retreat; under the cover of darkness the Spanish force fled through the Urubamba valley with the Incas in pursuit and reached Cusco the next day.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, Queen's Park {{requested}} more land {{for development of}} the second Hampden Park. This was refused by the landlords, {{which led to the}} club seeking a new site. Henry Erskine Gordon agreed to sell 12 acres of land off Somerville Drive to Queen's Park in November 1899. James Miller designed twin grandstands along {{the south side of the}} ground with a pavilion wedged in between. The natural slopes were shaped to form banks of terracing, designed by Archibald Leitch. Construction of the new ground took over three years to complete; during construction, a disaster occurred at Ibrox in which part of the wooden <b>terraces</b> collapsed. In response, the <b>terraces</b> at Hampden were firmly set in the earthwork and innovative techniques were used to control spectators.|$|E
5|$|Lakes also formed (or expanded) in the Atacama at that time; highstands in Lejía Lake began rising after 11,480 ± 70 BP, and in Salar Aguas Calientes high-water levels {{lasted until}} 8,430 ± 75 BP. Highstands in Laguna Khota {{occurred}} around 12,500 and 11,000 BP. Some Salar de Atacama highstands {{are associated with}} Lake Tauca and the Coipasa highstand. Traces of the Tauca humid episode have been found at Salar Pedernales, past 26° south latitude. Lake Tauca's highstand correlates with river <b>terraces</b> in Peru's Pisco River; <b>terraces</b> dated 24,000–16,000 BP in its tributary, the Quebrada Veladera; enlarged drainage systems in the Quebrada Veladera; a humid period at Lake Junin, and new soil formation in the pampas south of the Quinto River in Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{development}} at this time consisted of new residential areas away from the old city centre. Queen Square was the first speculative development by John Wood, the Elder, who lived {{in one of the}} houses. The Circus consists of three long, curved <b>terraces</b> designed by the elder John Wood to form a circular space or theatre intended for civic functions and games. The games give a clue to the design, the inspiration behind which was the Colosseum in Rome. The most spectacular of Bath's <b>terraces</b> is the Royal Crescent, built between 1767 and 1774 and designed by the younger John Wood. Gay Street links Queen Square to The Circus. All of which were designed by John Wood, the Elder in 1735 and completed by his son John Wood, the Younger.|$|E

5|$|The main access {{route to}} Ollantaytambo runs along a narrow valley {{formed in the}} {{mountains}} by the Urubamba River, which connects the site with Machu Picchu {{to the west and}} with Pisaq and Cusco to the east. After his uprising, Manco Inca fortified the eastern approaches to fend off attacks from the former Inca capital, now under Spanish occupation. The first line of defense was a steep bank of <b>terraces</b> at Pachar, near the confluence of the Anta and Urubamba rivers. Behind it, the Incas channeled the Urubamba to make it cross the valley from right to left and back thus forming two more lines backed by the fortifications of Choqana on the left bank and 'Inkapintay on the right bank. Past them, at the plain of Mascabamba, eleven high <b>terraces</b> closed the valley between the mountains and a deep canyon formed by the Urubamba. The only way to continue was through the gate of T'iyupunku, a thick defensive wall with two narrow doorways. In the event of these fortifications being overrun, the Temple Hill, a religious center surrounded by high <b>terraces</b> overlooking Ollantaytambo, provided a last line of defense.|$|E
5|$|The new stand {{became a}} {{financial}} burden for the club. Operating costs increased after Norwegian clubs {{were allowed to}} wage players from 1984. In addition, interest rates rose quickly, making the club unable to meet its financial obligations. At the same time, the club experienced falling attendance. In 1985, the club's auditor warned that the club was heading into financial distress. In 1986, the club spent NOK1 million to build <b>terraces</b> between the club house and the pitch on the northern short side, and <b>terraces</b> on the southern short side. In 1990, Hamar Municipality gave Ham-Kam a grant of NOK1.7 million {{in an attempt to}} save the club's finances, {{in part because of the}} club's debt on the venue.|$|E

5|$|The {{sides of}} the Tor have seven deep, roughly {{symmetrical}} <b>terraces,</b> or lynchets. Their formation remains a mystery with many possible explanations. They may have been formed {{as a result of}} natural differentiation of the layers of Lias stone and clay used by farmers during the Middle Ages as terraced hills to make ploughing for crops easier. Author Nicholas Mann questions this theory. If agriculture had been the reason for the creation of the <b>terraces,</b> it would be expected that the effort would be concentrated on the south side, where the sunny conditions would provide a good yield, but the <b>terraces</b> are equally deep on the northern side, which would provide little benefit. Additionally, none of the other slopes of the island have been terraced, even though the more sheltered locations would provide a greater return on the labour involved. Alternatively, the flattened paths may have been created by the hooves of grazing cattle.|$|E
5|$|There are 33 {{archaeological sites}} within the park, which include: cave paintings, ancient settlements, <b>terraces</b> for agriculture, tombs, fortresses and {{irrigation}} works. There's also a pre-Columbian road between {{the towns of}} Olleros and Chavin.|$|E
5|$|Weymouth's esplanade is {{composed}} of Georgian <b>terraces,</b> which have been converted into apartments, shops, hotels and guest houses.
