25|$|Project 720 was a {{high school}} reform program {{implemented}} for three years under the Rendell administration. The intent was to increase academic rigor and improve the instruction of teachers in the Commonwealth’s high schools. Teachers were expected <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>data</b> driven instructional practices and {{to meet the needs of}} diverse learners. The 720 in the name referred to the number of days a student was in high school in ninth through 12th grades. High schools applied for funding and were required to agree to report to the PDE their plans, their actions and the outcomes. In 2007-08 budget year, the Commonwealth provided $11 million in funding. Lakeland School District was one of 161 PA public school districts to apply, receiving $171,000 funding over three years. For 2010-11, Project 720 funding was decreased to $1.7 million by Governor Rendell. The grant program was discontinued effective with the 2011-12 state budget.|$|E
500|$|These {{toxicity}} tests provide, in {{the words}} of a 2006 United States National Academy of Sciences report, [...] "critical information for assessing hazard and risk potential". Animal tests may overestimate risk, with false positive results being a particular problem, but false positives appear not to be prohibitively common. Variability in results arises from using the effects of high doses of chemicals in small numbers of laboratory animals to try to predict the effects of low doses in large numbers of humans. Although relationships do exist, opinion is divided on how <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>data</b> on one species to predict the exact level of risk in another.|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA) {{reported}} {{its interest}} {{in using the}} Reaper and its MTS-B sensor to provide firing quality data for early interception of ballistic missile launches. The MDA is exploring concepts to use the UAV's EO/IR sensor to achieve [...] "launch-on-remote" [...] capabilities with missile interceptors before detection by Aegis radars. [...] At least two aircraft {{would be needed to}} triangulate a target to provide high-fidelity data. The MTS-B includes short and mid-wave IR bands, optimal for tracking launch and rocket burn. In 2013, the MDA terminated plans to build a follow-on to the two orbiting Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS) satellites due to near-term costs, opting to continue testing the Reaper for ballistic missile target discrimination. The MDA planned to test the improved MTS-C sensor, which adds a long-wave IR detector optimized for tracking cold bodies such as missiles and warheads after booster burnout, or plumes and exhaust. The goal is <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>data</b> from multiple high-flying UAVs to provide an off-board cue to launch an SM-3 missile from an Aegis ship. Two Reapers demonstrated their ability to track ballistic missiles using their MTS-B EO/IR turret during a test in late June 2016.|$|E
