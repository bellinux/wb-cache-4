5|$|The German advance never {{recovered}} from its initial delay, and Kampfgruppe Peiper only {{got as far}} as Stoumont, where the remaining vehicles ran out of fuel and came under heavy attack from American aircraft, artillery, and tanks. Having advanced less than half-way to the River Meuse, they were forced to abandon more than a hundred vehicles in the town, including six Tiger II tanks. The soldiers were ordered to find their way east on foot. Having started the offensive with about 5,800 men, 60 tanks (including 30 Tiger IIs), 3 flak tanks, 75 half-tracks, 14 20mm Flak Wagons, 27 75mm assault guns, plus 105 and 150mm SP Howitzers, Hitler's prized Kampfgruppe was reduced to 800 S.S. troopers creeping <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> at night, trying to get back to their own line.|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the album}} credits for the {{instruments}} have fanciful names that describe the sound they make. The [...] "Castanet Guitars" [...] are electric guitars played with mallets and are electronically treated to sound something like castanets. The [...] "Leslie piano" [...] is an acoustic piano miked and fed through a Leslie speaker with a built-in revolving horn speaker. Eno described the [...] "snake guitar" [...] and [...] "digital guitar" [...] by stating [...] "the kind of lines I was playing {{reminded me of the}} way a snake moves <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>brush,</b> a sort of speedy, forceful, liquid quality. Digital guitar is a guitar threaded through a digital delay but fed back on itself a lot so it makes this cardboard tube type of sound." ...|$|E
2500|$|The initial {{settlers}} to Helena, initially named Cove, were {{veterans of}} the final campaigns of the War of 1812. Members of Andrew Jackson’s army who cut <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> were attracted to the quiet, peaceful valleys and streams after the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. These first settlers were reported to arrive in 1849 and were predated by the Creek Indian tribes who these settlers had battled. By 1856, the Cove post office opened. Shortly thereafter, the settlers changed {{the name of the}} town to Hillsboro.|$|E

2500|$|Continued hot {{dry weather}} allowed the both fires to grow {{significantly}} on September 3. [...] The Booth Fire advanced {{on the west}} side of the Cascades, southeast of Marion Forks, Oregon.

2500|$|After three months, {{the founders}} of the hospital, Dr. Piero Corti and his wife Lucille Teasdale-Corti, had decided that he would be their successor. [...] He soon came to be known to his colleagues and {{patients}} as [...] "Dr. Matthew". [...] Many patients were victims of attacks by the rebel Lord's Resistance Army. [...] On Good Friday 1989, the rebels came to St. Mary's to abduct several Italian nuns. [...] Lukwiya managed to convince the rebels to take him instead and spent a week wandering <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> in his physician's gown until the rebels released him. [...] He subsequently opened the gates of the hospital compound to people seeking a place to sleep that was safe from rebel attacks and abduction. [...] Until the Ebola outbreak, 9000 people sought sanctuary on the hospital grounds nightly to sleep. [...] In a later incident, Lukwiya, his wife Margaret and five children were lying in bed one evening listening to nearby fighting between the rebels and government forces when a mortar shell crashed through the ceiling of their house, but failed to explode. He also played an unpublicised role in advocating for a peaceful solution to the war.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} types of dust and debris {{collection}} bins for he 500 series robots. The standard vacuum bin incorporates a squeegee vacuum. The high-capacity sweeper bin does not include a vacuum, but has greater debris capacity.

The species we identified come from the samples collected in the period 2001 - 2002, along the river course and the main tributaries of the Cerna River in this sector. The samples were collected from different rocks, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>brushing</b> method; then <b>the</b> samples were preserved and processed by specific techniques.

50|$|Typically, {{slip ring}} {{consists}} of a stationary graphite or metal contact (brush) which rubs on the outside diameter of a rotating metal ring. As the metal ring turns, the electric current or signal is conducted <b>through</b> <b>the</b> stationary <b>brush</b> to <b>the</b> metal ring making the connection. Additional ring/brush assemblies are stacked along the rotating axis if more than one electrical circuit is needed. Either <b>the</b> <b>brushes</b> or <b>the</b> rings are stationary and the other component rotates.This simple design {{has been used for}} decades as a rudimentary method of passing current into a rotating device.|$|R
