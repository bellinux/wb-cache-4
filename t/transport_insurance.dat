50|$|In 1902 the Gothaer Lebensversicherungsbank f√ºr Deutschland {{is finally}} renamed Gothaer Lebensversicherungsbank auf Gegenseitigkeit. In the recent decades, till 1918, the Gothaer Group {{achieved}} an insurance portfolio of 1.24 billion (Mark) and an asset of almost 500 billion (Mark). Unfortunately - {{as a result}} of the World War I - the company was forced to struggle for its existence and independence.

The Gothaer Group managed to cope with this crisis and was able - in the period from 1924 to 1944 - to establish their insurance portfolio of 1.25 billion (Mark). In 1924 the Gothaer Allgemeine Versicherungs AG had been set up.

More broadly, the Moroccan insurance sector is already consolidated, with five large players controlling the market. The sector is set to be opened up to foreign competition from 2010 onward, and the consolidation of insurance companies into larger entities should strengthen the local players to better compete with eventual competition from foreign insurers. There is also the possibility that new insurance niches such as takaful (Islamic insurance) and microinsurance products will become part of the Moroccan market in the medium-term, but they are unlikely to appear in the near future.|$|E
