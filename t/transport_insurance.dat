50|$|In 1902 the Gothaer Lebensversicherungsbank für Deutschland {{is finally}} renamed Gothaer Lebensversicherungsbank auf Gegenseitigkeit. In the recent decades, till 1918, the Gothaer Group {{achieved}} an insurance portfolio of 1.24 billion (Mark) and an asset of almost 500 billion (Mark). Unfortunately - {{as a result}} of the World War I - the company was forced to struggle for its existence and independence. The war caused an inflation whereby the company’s insurance portfolio and asset have been devalued. The Gothaer Group managed to cope with this crisis and was able - in the period from 1924 to 1944 - to establish their insurance portfolio of 1.25 billion (Mark). In 1924 the Gothaer Allgemeine Versicherungs AG had been set up. Its main task was to handle the emergent motor insurance business, which contains: accident insurance, liability insurance, <b>transport</b> <b>insurance</b> and automobile insurance. The Gothaer Allgemeine Versicherungs AG was found by Karls August Friedrich Samwer, who was the great grandfather of the popular “Samwer-Brothers”.

At his behest, Lejeune-Jung drafted a politicoeconomic plan for the time after the dictatorship were successfully overthrown.

More broadly, the Moroccan insurance sector is already consolidated, with five large players controlling the market. The sector is set to be opened up to foreign competition from 2010 onward, and the consolidation of insurance companies into larger entities should strengthen the local players to better compete with eventual competition from foreign insurers. There is also the possibility that new insurance niches such as takaful (Islamic insurance) and microinsurance products will become part of the Moroccan market in the medium-term, but they are unlikely to appear in the near future.|$|E
